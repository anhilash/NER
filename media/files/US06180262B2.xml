    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to thermal spray coating and more particularly, to an improved composition for the coating as applied onto gas turbine engine rotating members.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Large gas turbine engines are widely used for aircraft propulsion and for ground based power generation.
      <br/>
      Such large gas turbine engines are of the axial type, and include a compressor section, a combustor section, and a turbine section, with the compressor section normally preceded by a fan section.
      <br/>
      An annular flow path for working medium gases extends axially through the sections of the engine.
      <br/>
      Each of the fan, compressor, and turbine sections comprises a plurality of disks mounted on a shaft, with a plurality of airfoil shaped blades projecting radially from the disks.
      <br/>
      A hollow case surrounds the various engine sections.
      <br/>
      A plurality of stationary vanes are located between the disks and project inwardly from the case assembly which surrounds the disks.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      During operation of the fan, compressor, and turbine sections, as the working medium gases are flowed axially, they alternately contact moving blades and the stationary vanes.
      <br/>
      In the fan and compressor sections, air is compressed and the compressed air is combined with fuel and burned in the combustion section to provide high pressure, high temperature gases.
      <br/>
      The working medium gases then flow through the turbine section, where energy is extracted by causing the bladed turbine disks to rotate.
      <br/>
      A portion of this energy is used to operate the compressor section and the fan section.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Engine efficiency depends to a significant extent upon minimizing leakage of the gas flow to maximize interaction between the gas stream and the moving and stationary airfoils.
      <br/>
      A major source of inefficiency is leakage of gas around the tips of the compressor blades, between the blade tips and, the engine case.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, means to improve efficiency by reduction of leakage are increasingly important.
      <br/>
      Although a close tolerance fit may be obtained by fabricating the blade tips and the engine case to mate to a very close tolerance range, this fabrication process is extremely costly and time consuming.
      <br/>
      Further, when the assembly formed by mating the blade tips and the engine case is exposed to a high temperature environment and rotational forces, as when in use, the coefficients of expansion of the blade tips and the engine case parts may differ, thus causing the clearance space to either increase or decrease.
      <br/>
      A significant decrease in clearance results in contact between blades and housing, and friction between the parts generates heat causing a significant elevation of temperatures and possible damage to one or both members.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, increased clearance space would permit gas to escape between the compressor blade and housing, thus decreasing efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One approach to increase efficiency is to apply an abradable coating of suitable material to the interior surface of the compressor housing, which when abraded allows for the creation of a channel between the blade tips and the housing.
      <br/>
      Leakage between the blade tips and the housing is limited to airflow in the channel.
      <br/>
      Various coating techniques have been employed to coat the inside diameter of the compressor housing with an abradable coating that can be worn away by the frictional contact of the compressor blade, to provide a close fitting channel in which the blade tip may travel.
      <br/>
      Thus, when subjecting the coated assembly to a high temperature and stress environment, the blade and the case may expand or contract without resulting in significant gas leakage between the blade tip and the housing.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      However, it is critical that the blade tips not degrade when contacted with the coatings applied to the interior surface of the compressor housing.
      <br/>
      To increase the durability of the blade tips which rub against the abradable seals, abrasive layers are sometimes applied to the blade tip surface.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The abrasive layers must have a particular combination of properties.
      <br/>
      They must be resistant to erosion from the high velocity, high temperature gas streams which at times may carry fine particulate matter with them.
      <br/>
      The abradable coating must also be structurally sound to resist the thermal and vibratory strains imposed upon it in use.
      <br/>
      In addition, the intentional contact between the abrasive tip and engine case creates a demanding, high wear environment for the abrasive blade tip coating.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Considerable effort has gone into the development of abradable coatings having the desired combination of properties.
      <br/>
      For example, Vine et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,861,618 discloses a thermal barrier coating which may be used on the airfoil section of a turbine blade.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, Vine et al. discloses a NiCoCrAlY bond coat with a ceramic overcoat of zirconia comprising six to eight weight percent (6 to 8 wt. %) yttria.
    </p>
    <p num="10">This above art notwithstanding, scientists and engineers working under the direction of Applicant's assignee are seeking to improve the composition of the abrasive coating applied to substrates in a gas turbine engine.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">According to the present invention, a thermal abrasive coating having an improved resistance to corrosion consisting of from eleven to fourteen weight percent (11 to 14 wt. %) of yttria and the balance essentially zirconia.</p>
    <p num="12">
      A primary feature of the coating consisting of 11 to 14 weight percent of yttria is a coating with a lower thermal conductivity as compared with prior art coatings containing from six to nine weight percent (6 to 9 wt. %) yttria.
      <br/>
      The thermal conductivity of the coating is one point one five watts per meter kelvin (1 * 15 watts/meter-k) as compared with one point four watts per meter kelvin (1 * 4 watts/meter-k) for coatings containing six to nine weight percent (6 to 9 wt. %) yttria.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      An advantage of the present invention is the lower substrate temperature that results during high temperature frictional heating due to the interaction between the blade tips and the engine case.
      <br/>
      The high yttria content of the present invention leads to an improved temperature stability of the coating as compared with coatings containing a lower weight percent of yttria.
      <br/>
      Changes in the crystallographic structure of the coating are reduced as compared with prior art coatings containing lower weight percent of yttria.
      <br/>
      Consequently, spalling incidents and disintegration of the coating resulting from high temperature are also substantially reduced.
      <br/>
      This, in turn, provides for a coating that is contiguously bonded on the substrate and thus increases the ability of the substrate to resist corrosive effects of the ambient environment.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in the light of the following detailed description of the best mode for carrying out the invention and from the accompanying drawings which illustrate an embodiment of the invention.</p>

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 2 shows a schematic representation of an apparatus for forming and propelling particles of coating medium and a holding fixture.
      <br/>
      A plurality of rotating blades such as compressor blades 10 are positioned in the cylindrical holding fixture 12.
      <br/>
      The holding fixture has an axis of rotation Ar.
      <br/>
      The holding fixture can accommodate a large number of blades, up to a full stage of blades.
      <br/>
      The fixture diameter ranges from about eighteen to thirty six inches (18 to 36") (457 to 914 mm), preferably about twenty to twenty-eight inches (20 to 28") (508 to 711 mm) to approximate the size of the flowpath of the engine.
      <br/>
      The large size of the fixture can accommodate an entire stage of blades.
      <br/>
      Selecting a fixture which positions the blades at a radius from the axis of rotation Ar which is the same as the operative radius ensures the location of the blade tip approximates closely the radius in the engine.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Each rotor blade has a root and a platform.
      <br/>
      An airfoil extends from the platform and terminates in a tip.
      <br/>
      Each airfoil has a leading edge and a trailing edge.
      <br/>
      A suction surface and a pressure surface extend between the edges.
      <br/>
      The blades are oriented such that points on the blade tips describe a circle about the axis of rotation of the holding fixture.
      <br/>
      The blade tips face in the outward direction from the holding fixture.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The apparatus for propelling particles toward the blade tips, as represented by a spray coating apparatus 14, is in close proximity to the holding fixture.
      <br/>
      The spray coating apparatus includes a spray gun 16 positioned at the outer diameter of the cylindrical fixture for depositing the layers.
      <br/>
      The spray gun is translatable in different directions with respect to the holding fixture.
      <br/>
      The spray coating apparatus forms a heated plasma including molten particles, such as molten zirconium oxide particles, which are propelled in the heated plasma gas stream toward the blades disposed in the fixture.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In one embodiment, the blades are positioned in the holding fixture such that adjacent points on the blade tips approximate a surface of rotation substantially parallel to the surface of rotation which the blade tip will experience while in a working engine.
      <br/>
      As the blades are rotated, the gun moves up and down in a direction substantially parallel to the surface of rotation of the fixture, coating the blades in sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The thickness of the abrasive coating deposited depends on the application of the substrate.
      <br/>
      In compressor and brush seal applications, the abrasive layer may have a thickness ranging from five to forty mils (5 to 40 mils) (0.13 to 1.02 mm).
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 3 is an enlarged view taken along lines 3--3 of FIG. 2 showing the relationship between the plasma spray propelled from the apparatus for forming and propelling particles and the blade tips disposed in the holding fixture.
      <br/>
      The circumferential width of the spray can range from the size of the circumferential width of the blades to a width ten times (10 * ) that of the circumferential width of the blades.
      <br/>
      This enables the spray coating to be deposited uniformly onto the suction and pressure surfaces of the airfoil of the blade.
      <br/>
      The phenomenon of overspraying is known in the art, even in processes that spray coat straight onto blade tips that are stationary.
      <br/>
      However, the overspray that results from the present invention process, coats more airfoil surface area and is applied uniformly as compared with prior art processes.
      <br/>
      The overspray onto the airfoil surfaces provides for better adhesion of the spray coating onto the blades.
      <br/>
      The coating is not subject to chipping at the leading and trailing edges as by overspraying and applying the coating to the leading and trailing edges of the blade and to contiguous areas of the suction and pressure surfaces, as well as to the tip itself, a more durable blade tip may be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The processing steps of the invention are controlled to produce vertical microcracking (essentially perpendicular to the bond coat surface) and are specific to variables such as gun-type and fixture geometry.
      <br/>
      The vertical microcracks may extend through a top coating layer to a bond coating layer.
      <br/>
      The vertical microcracks do not extend to the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      The processing steps include the selection of certain parameters.
      <br/>
      These parameters include rotating the fixture at a preselected speed, angling the gun with respect to the substrate, moving the gun at a preselected traverse speed, heating the substrate to a preselected temperature, injecting the coating powder at a preselected rate, and flowing the carrier gas and plasma gases at preselected flow rates.
      <br/>
      These parameters all influence the structure of the coating and as such should be adjusted to provide uniform coating of compressor blades, or other substrates.
      <br/>
      In general, it has been found that a close gun-to-substrate spray distance coupled with relatively high spray gun power results in the desired vertical segmentation or microcracking of the coating structure.
      <br/>
      The parameters described herein were tailored for use with an F-4 model air plasma spray gun purchased from Plasma Technics, Inc., now supplied by Sulzer Metco having facilities in Westbury, N.Y., and various diameter cylindrical fixtures depending on substrate configuration.
      <br/>
      As will be realized, the parameters may vary with the use of a different spray gun and/or fixture.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the parameters set forth herein may be used as a guide for selecting other suitable parameters for different operating conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The process for controllably applying spray coating as flow charted in FIG. 1, includes a number of interrelated steps beginning with providing blades having clean, exposed blade tips and protected airfoil and root surfaces typically provided by masking.
      <br/>
      Conventional cleaning and preparation of the blade tip prior to application of the abrasive layer should be conducted.
      <br/>
      In the practice of the present invention, for example with a blade tip as shown in the figures, the surface of the blade tip is cleaned and roughened to enhance adherence of subsequently applied coating materials.
      <br/>
      Such cleaning can include mechanical abrasion such as through a vapor or air blast type process employing dry or liquid carried abrasive particles impacting the surface.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Prior to cleaning the surface, blades are suitably masked as shown in U.S. Application Number EH-10117 U.S. Ser. No. 08/994,626, entitled "Shield and Method for Protecting an Airfoil Surface", by Zajchowski and Diaz, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The process includes propelling a spray of particles of softened bond coating medium toward the blade tips.
      <br/>
      The step of propelling the coating medium includes the step of forming a spray of particles of softened bond coating medium in the spray coating apparatus.
      <br/>
      This step includes flowing bond coat powder and carrier gases into a high-temperature plasma gas stream.
      <br/>
      In the plasma gas stream, the powder particles are melted and accelerated toward the substrate.
      <br/>
      Generally, the powder feed rate should be adjusted to provide adequate consistency and amount of bond coating.
      <br/>
      The bond coat powder feed rate ranges from thirty to fifty-five grams per minute (30 to 55 grams/min).
      <br/>
      Carrier gas flow (argon gas) is used to maintain the powder under pressure and facilitate powder feed.
      <br/>
      The carrier gas flow rate ranges from four to eight standard cubic feet per hour (4 to 8 scfh) (1.9 to 3.8 standard liters per minute (SLM)).
      <br/>
      Standard conditions are herein defined as about room temperature (77 (degree)  F.) and about one atmosphere of pressure (760 mmHg) (101 kPa).
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The gases that make up the plasma gas stream comprise of a primary gas (argon gas) and a secondary gas (hydrogen gas).
      <br/>
      Helium gas may also be used as a secondary gas.
      <br/>
      The primary gas flow rate in the gun ranges from seventy-five to one hundred and fifteen standard cubic feet per hour (75 to 115 scfh) (35 to 54 SLM), while the secondary gas flow rate ranges from ten to twenty-five standard cubic feet per hour (10 to 25 scfh) (4.7 to 12 SLM).
      <br/>
      Spray gun power generally ranges from thirty to fifty kilowatts (30 to 50 KW).
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The process then includes the step of translating the spray of softened bond coating medium at a distance ranging between about four to six inches (4 to 6") (102 to 152 mm) from the blade tips, between a first and second position.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the spray gun is moved in a direction substantially parallel to the surface of rotation of the holding fixture.
      <br/>
      Spray gun traverse speed during bond coat deposition ranges from six to twelve inches per minute (6 to 12 in/min) (152 to 305 mm/min).
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Further, the process includes passing the blades through the spray of particles of softened bond coating medium by rotating the fixture about its axis of rotation.
      <br/>
      This step includes heating the blades to a temperature of two hundred to four hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit (200 to 450 (degree)  F.) by passing the blades in front of the spray gun and hot plasma gas stream.
      <br/>
      The step of passing the blades through the spray of particles of softened bond coating medium also includes cooling the blades and the coating layer deposited by rotating them away from the spray gun.
      <br/>
      Additional cooling of the blades can be provided by directing a cooling air stream or cooling jet on the blades or the fixture.
      <br/>
      Independent sources of heating can also be provided to heat the blades prior to the blades entering the spray of particles of coating medium.
      <br/>
      The independent heating source would allow for control of blade temperature without adjusting the spray gun to provide heating.
      <br/>
      Specifically, during bond coat deposition, the cylindrical fixture rotates at a speed which ranges from twenty to seventy-five revolutions per minute (20 to 75 rpm), depending on substrate diameter.
      <br/>
      The surface speed of the blades ranges typically from one hundred and twenty-five to three hundred surface feet per minute (125 to 300 sfpm).
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The coating process then includes the step of forming a spray of particles of softened top coating medium.
      <br/>
      This step includes flowing top coat powder and carrier gases into the high-temperature plasma gas stream.
      <br/>
      Generally, the powder feed rate should be adjusted to provide adequate mix to cover the substrate, yet not be so great as to reduce melting and crack formation.
      <br/>
      Top coat powder feed rate ranges from fifteen to forty grams per minute (15 to 40 grams/min).
      <br/>
      Carrier gas flow (argon gas) is used to maintain the powder under pressure and facilitate powder feed.
      <br/>
      The flow rate ranges from four to eight standard cubic feet per hour (4 to 8 scfh) (1.9 to 3.8 SLM).
      <br/>
      As described hereinabove, standard conditions are herein defined as about room temperature (77 (degree)  F.) and about one atmosphere of pressure (760 mmHg) (101 kPa).
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The step of forming a spray of particles of softened top coating medium includes the injection of the top coat powder angled such that it imparts a component of velocity to the powder which is opposite to the direction of flow of the plasma toward the rotating fixture.
      <br/>
      The projection of the injection angle in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the holding fixture lies in a range from sixty-five to eighty-five degrees (65 to 85 (degree) ).
      <br/>
      This injection angle serves to introduce the top coat powder further back into the plasma plume, thus increasing the residence time of the powder in the plasma gas stream.
      <br/>
      The increased residence time in the plasma gas stream provides for better melting of the powder particles.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Primary gas flow (argon gas) in the gun ranges from fifty to ninety standard cubic feet per hour (50 to 90 scfh) (24 to 43 SLM).
      <br/>
      Similarly, secondary gas flow (hydrogen gas) in the gun ranges from ten to thirty scfh (10 to 30 scfh) (4.7 to 14 SLM).
      <br/>
      Spray gun power generally ranges from thirty to fifty kilowatts (30 to 50 KW).
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The process further includes the step of translating a spray of softened top coating medium at a distance ranging from three to four inches (3 to 4") (76 to 102 mm) from the blade tips, between a first and second position in a direction substantially normal to the plane of rotation of the holding fixture.
      <br/>
      Spray gun traverse speed across each part during deposition ranges from two to ten inches per minute (2 to 10 in/min) (50.8 to 254 mm/min).
      <br/>
      The gun-to-substrate distance may be varied with the intent of maintaining the appropriate temperature level at the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      A close gun-to-substrate distance is necessary for satisfactory vertical microcracking.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The process further includes the step of passing blades through the spray of particles of softened top coating medium by rotating the fixture about its axis of rotation, wherein the step includes heating the blades by passing the blades in front of the spray gun.
      <br/>
      The temperature of top coat application is the temperature measured at the substrate at the time of applying the top coating.
      <br/>
      The temperature of application may vary from three hundred to eight hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit (300 (degree)  F. to 850 (degree)  F.).
      <br/>
      The actual temperature of application is preferably maintained at a relatively constant level varying from about  +- five to ten percent ( +- 5% to 10%) of a predetermined temperature, depending upon the size of engine element coated, and the substrate on which the top coating is sprayed.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The step of passing the blades through the spray of softened particles includes the step of cooling the blades.
      <br/>
      Additionally, external cooling may be used to control deposition temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      This process results in layers of bond and top coating being sequentially deposited onto the blade tips in a surface of rotation substantially parallel to the surface of rotation which the blades describe when rotating in operating conditions.
      <br/>
      While the phenomenon is not well understood, it is believed that by depositing coating layers one at a time in an orientation substantially parallel to the surface of rotation that the coating layers will experience in an operating engine, the process confers an advantage as it provides relatively uniform microcracking of the coating in a radial direction.
      <br/>
      This results in relatively uniform stresses in the coating structure during operative conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The bond coating medium provides an oxidation resistant coating.
      <br/>
      Typically, the bond coating material is a nickel-aluminum alloy.
      <br/>
      However, the bond coating medium may alternatively comprise of MCrAlY or other oxidation resistive material.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The top coating medium used consists essentially of from eleven to fourteen weight percent (11 to 14 wt. %) of yttria and the balance essentially being zirconia.
      <br/>
      This top coating composition with a high yttria content provides improved resistance to corrosion, as well as better temperature stability of the top coating ceramic material.
      <br/>
      The improved stability of the top coating material decreases the likelihood of spalling of the material.
      <br/>
      Thus, the substrate material remains protected from the corrosive effects of the sulfides and salts from the ambient environmental conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Further, the high yttria content of the top coating material provides for a material having a lower thermal conductivity as compared with material prepared with lower yttria content.
      <br/>
      The thermal conductivity for the eleven to fourteen weight percent (11 to 14 wt. %) yttria is approximately one point one five watts per meter Kelvin (1.15 watts/meter-k) as compared to a thermal conductivity of one point four watts per meter Kelvin (1.4 watts/meter-k) for a coating consisting of seven to nine weight percent (7 to 9 wt. %) of yttria.
      <br/>
      The lower thermal conductivity of the coating provides an advantage during rub events in an operational engine when the blade tips make contact with the inner surface of the engine case.
      <br/>
      The rub generates a step input of frictional heat in the contacting surfaces.
      <br/>
      This heat has to be removed.
      <br/>
      The lower thermal conductivity of the blade tip coating, comprising eleven to fourteen weight percent yttria, provides for heat transfer from the blade tips via convection and radiation.
      <br/>
      The process of conduction is not used for heat removal.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is believed that lower thermal conductivity of the coating would result in a lower substrate temperature as the coating does not conduct heat down to the bond coat and therefore to the substrate as compared with substrates coated with compositions containing a lower weight percent of yttria.
      <br/>
      The properties of the base metal substrate, thus are unaffected by heat as in the case of compressor blade tips, and thus retains the coating better in service.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      A primary advantage of the present invention is the quality of coating applied to the tips of rotor blades which results from using the process to distribute among a multiplicity of the rotor blades any variations in the process flow parameters affecting the stream of particles propelled against the tips.
      <br/>
      Due to the rotating fixture, a number of blades pass through the spray of softened coating medium.
      <br/>
      Any variations in the flow parameters such as variations in spray intensity, temperature, composition and feed of powders to the spray are distributed over a number of blades that pass through the spray during the period of variation.
      <br/>
      This ensures that one rotor blade tip does not receive all of the variations in coating.
      <br/>
      As a result, the coating process of the present invention provides for a more uniform coating and has less sensitivity to process variations than a process using a stationary fixture in which all variations are deposited only on a single blade.
      <br/>
      Further, the coating is applied in layers that are approximately parallel to the location of that part of the tip of the rotor blade about the axis.
      <br/>
      By selecting a fixture which positions the tips at a radius from the axis of rotation Ar which is the same as the operative radius ensures the location of the tip approximates closely the radius in the engine.
      <br/>
      As a result, the coating is substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the fixture and the coating layer follows approximately the surface of rotation which the coating layer will experience during operation of the engine.
      <br/>
      It is believed the orientation of the coating will enhance performance of the coating.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Another advantage is the reproducible and reliable process that results due to the use of the control parameters.
      <br/>
      This process can be used to repetitively apply bond coating onto substrate surfaces or top coating onto bond coating layers.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Another advantage is the ease and speed of application of the coating on the surfaces of a large number of blades at a given time which results from the size of the holding fixture and process which accommodates a multiplicity of blades.
      <br/>
      Using a holding fixture that accommodates a number of blades, the resultant fixturing time is minimized.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, an entire stage of blades can be coated.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Another advantage of the present invention is the application of coating to substrates without the use of additional heating apparatus for the substrates.
      <br/>
      During coating deposition, the optimum amount of heat required is transmitted to the substrates through the plasma gas and the molten coating powder.
      <br/>
      The rotor blade is not overheated during the coating process.
      <br/>
      As a result, a rotor blade can be coated without changing the substrate microstructure or properties.
