    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a thin film transistor and a method of manufacturing the same.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a thin film transistor which is suitable for incorporation into a static random access memory (SRAM).
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In general, thin film transistors may be used instead of load resistors in SRAMs having densities exceeding 1 megabit.
      <br/>
      Thin film transistors are also widely used as switching elements for switching image data signals in pixel regions of a liquid crystal display device.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Ideally, in either application, the off current of the thin film transistor should be low, while on current should be high in order to reduce power consumption and improve memory characteristics.
      <br/>
      That is, the thin film transistor should have a high on/off current ratios.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Much research has focused on achieving a thin film transistor with improved on/off current ratios.</p>
    <p num="6">A method for manufacturing a thin film transistor in an attempt to achieve an improved on/off current ratio is shown in FIGS. 1a-1e. In particular, these figures illustrate processing steps for manufacturing a conventional bottom gate thin film transistor on a semiconductor substrate.</p>
    <p num="7">
      As shown in FIG. 1a, a first insulating film 2 is formed on a semiconductor substrate 1.
      <br/>
      After depositing a polysilicon layer 3 on first insulating film 2, polysilicon layer 2 is patterned by conventional photolithography and etching techniques according to a gate mask, thereby forming a gate electrode 3a.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      As shown in FIG. 1, through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, a gate insulating film 4 and a polysilicon body layer 5 are successively deposited on the entire exposed surface of gate electrode 3a and first insulating film 2.
      <br/>
      Then, during a 24 hour heat treatment growth step, the wafer is subjected to a temperature of approximately 600 (degree)  C. As a result, the grain size of polysilicon layer 5 is enlarged.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      As shown in FIG. 1c, a photoresist film is next coated on body polysilicon layer 5 and patterned by conventional exposure and development processes to form a photoresist pattern PR1, which masks a channel region.
      <br/>
      At his time, with photoresist pattern PR1 serving as an ion-implantation mask, impurity ions are implanted into the exposed body of polysilicon layer 5, thereby forming source region 6a and drain region 6b (FIG. 1d).
    </p>
    <p num="10">Accordingly, where the impurity ions are not implanted in polysilicon body layer 5, a channel region A is formed, while another region between gate electrode 3a and drain region 6b serves as off-set region B.</p>
    <p num="11">
      As shown in FIG. 1e, after removing photoresist pattern PR1, a second insulating film 7 is formed on the entire surface of channel region A, off-set region B, source region 6a and drain region 6b.
      <br/>
      Second insulating film 7 is then patterned to form contact holes to source region 6a and drain region 6b, respectively.
      <br/>
      Then, the contact holes are filled with a conductor to thereby form a source electrode 8 and a drain electrode 9 as wiring electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="12">The operation principle of such conventional thin film transistor is as follows.</p>
    <p num="13">
      To begin with, if the transistor shown in FIG. 1e is a P-type MOS thin film transistor, channel region A has n conductivity, and source region 6a and drain region 6b have p conductivity.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if a negative voltage is applied to gate electrode 3a relative to source region 6a, holes accumulate in channel region A, thereby forming a channel.
      <br/>
      If a negative voltage is applied to drain region 6b relative to source region 6a, a current flows between source region 6a and drain region 6b, due to the potential difference between the source and drain.
      <br/>
      However, if no voltage is applied to gate electrode 3a, a channel is not formed, and current is disrupted.

      As shown in FIGS. 1a to 1e, channel region A and offset region B are both defined using photoresist pattern PR1.
      <br/>
      However, if photoresist pattern PR1 is misaligned, high off-current can result, thereby reducing reliability of the above-described thin-film transistor.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Further, while the conductivity of off-set region B is adjusted in order to decrease the off-current, the conductivity of region B is not affected by the potential on gate electrode 3a.

      Thus, the series resistance is increased, causing drain current drivability to deteriorate.

    <p num="22">Hereinafter; embodiments of the present invention will be described with the reference to the attached drawings.</p>
    <p num="23">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 2a is a cross-sectional view of a thin film transistor (TFT) according to a first embodiment of the present invention, and exemplify a case in which the TFT is formed on an insulating substrate.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2b is a cross-sectional view of the thin film transistor according to the first embodiment of the present invention formed on a semiconductor substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      As shown in FIG. 2a, the thin film transistor includes a gate electrode 11 formed on insulating substrate 10 and divided into edge portions E1 and E2 and a mid portion M. An insulating film 12 is formed on the surface of gate electrode 11 having a thickness overlying edge portion E1 which is greater than the thickness overlying edge portion E2 and mid portion M. Active region 17 is formed on the surface of insulating film 12 and exposed insulating substrate 10 including off-set region 16.
      <br/>
      Active region 17 includes channel region 13, source region 14, drain region 15 and edge portion E1 of gate electrode 11.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      As further shown in FIG. 2a, channel region 13 is formed on the surface of insulating film 12 above mid portion M of gate electrode 11, and source region 14 is formed on the surface of insulating substrate 10 above edge portion E2 of gate electrode 11.
      <br/>
      In addition, drain region 15 is formed to one side of gate electrode 11 so as not to overlap gate electrode 11.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Further, the TFT further comprises an insulating film 18 formed on active region 17 having contact holes to source and drain regions 14 and 15, respectively.
      <br/>
      A source electrode 19 is formed in the source contact hole and a drain electrode 20 is formed in the drain contact hole.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The TFT shown in FIG. 2b is similar to the one shown in FIG. 2a, except the TFT of FIG. 2b is formed on a semiconductor substrate 10a instead of an insulating substrate.
      <br/>
      Further, an insulating layer 21 is provided between semiconductor substrate 10a and gate electrode 11a, source region 14 and drain region 15 in order to electrically isolate the TFT from substrate 10.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Hereinafter, a method of manufacturing the thin film transistor according to the first embodiment on a polysilicon substrate will now be described with reference to FIGS. 3a to 3e.</p>
    <p num="30">It should be noted that the process for forming a TFT on an insulating substrate is the same as that shown in FIGS. 3a-3e, but omits the step of forming insulating layer 31.</p>
    <p num="31">
      As shown in FIG. 3a, an insulating layer 31 and a conductive layer 32 are successively formed on a semiconductor substrate 30.
      <br/>
      Conductive layer 32 is then patterned using a photoresist pattern PR2, thereby forming a gate electrode 32a.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As shown in FIG. 3b, the upper surface of gate electrode 32 is defined including edge portions E1 and E2 and a mid portion M. Then, a gate insulating layer 33 and an insulating layer 34 are successively formed on the exposed surface of gate electrode 32a and insulting layer 31.
      <br/>
      A photoresist pattern PR3 is coated on insulating layer 34 above portion E1 of gate electrode 32a.
      <br/>
      Then, using photoresist pattern PR3 as an etch mask, insulating layer 34 is patterned.
    </p>
    <p num="33">Thus, as shown in FIG. 3c, an insulating layer pattern 34a is left only on edge portion E1 of gate electrode 32a, while the rest of insulating layer 34 is removed.</p>
    <p num="34">
      A semiconductor layer, such as polysilicon serving as an active region 39, is then formed on the surface of insulating layer pattern 34a and exposed gate insulating layer 33.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, using a photoresist pattern PR4, part of active region 39 corresponding to mid portion M and edge portion E1 is masked, and impurity ions are implanted therein to thereby form a source region 36 and a drain region 37 at opposite sides of gate electrode 32a.
      <br/>
      As a result, the part of the active region 39 above mid portion M of gate electrode 32a serves as a channel region 35, and the part of active region 39 above edge portion E1 serves as an off-set region 38.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Preferably, gate insulating layer 33 and insulating layer 34 may be formed by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of silicon oxide film (SiO2) and a CVD of silicon nitride film (Sl3 N4), respectively.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, silicon nitride may be laid down prior to silicon oxide.
      <br/>
      Further, the thickness of insulating layer 34 is formed so as to be much thicker than that of gate insulating film 33.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      As described above, the process used to manufacture the thin film transistor shown in FIG. 2a differs from the one used to manufacture the transistor shown in FIG. 2b with respect to two steps.
      <br/>
      First, an insulating substrate is used instead of semiconductor substrate.
      <br/>
      Secondly, the step of forming insulating layer 31 in FIG. 3a is omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="37">As shown in FIG. 3d, a planarizing insulating layer 40 is formed on the entire surface of active region 39 and patterned to form a source contact hole 40a and a drain contact hole 40b on source region 36 and drain region 37, respectively.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Finally, as shown in FIG. 3e, a planarizing conductive layer 41 is formed on contact holes 40a and 40b and insulating layer 40 for planarization so as to completely fill contact holes 40a and 40b.
      <br/>
      Then, conductive layer 41 is patterned to form a source electrode 42 and a drain electrode 43 on source contact hole 40a and drain contact hole 40b, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Second Embodiment</p>
    <p num="40">Hereinafter, a thin film transistor according to a second embodiment and a related manufacturing method will be described with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5.</p>
    <p num="41">FIG. 4a is a cross-sectional view showing the structure of a TFT according to the second embodiment of the present invention, wherein the TFT is formed on an insulating substrate.</p>
    <p num="42">FIG. 4b is similar to FIG. 4a, except that a semiconductor substrate is used instead of an insulating substrate.</p>
    <p num="43">
      As shown in FIG. 4a, similarly to FIG. 2a, the TFT includes a gate electrode 51 formed on insulating substrate 50 having edge portions E1 and E2 and a mid portion M. An insulating film 52 is formed on the surface of gate electrode 51 having a greater thickness over edge portion E1 than over mid portion M and edge portion E2.
      <br/>
      An active region 57 is formed on the surface of insulating film 52 and exposed insulating substrate 50; the active region including an off-set region 56 corresponding to a channel region 53, a source region 54, a drain region 55 and edge portion E1 of gate electrode 51.
    </p>
    <p num="44">The TFT shown in FIG. 4a is similar to that shown in FIG. 2a, however, portions E1 and E2 of the gate electrode of the TFT, in accordance with the second embodiment, have sloped surfaces slanted downwardly away from mid part M.</p>
    <p num="45">
      Further, like FIG. 2a, a channel region 53 is formed on insulating film 52 above mid portion M of gate electrode 51.
      <br/>
      Source region 54 is is formed on the surface of insulating film 52 above edge portion E2 of gate electrode 51 and on the surface of insulating substrate 50 beyond the side of gate electrode 51.
      <br/>
      Also, drain region 55 is formed on the surface of insulating substrate 50 beyond the other side of gate electrode 51.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In addition, as shown in FIG. 4a, the thin film transistor according to the second embodiment further comprises an insulating film 58 formed on active region 57 having a source contact hole and a drain contact hole overlying source region 54 and drain region 55, respectively.
      <br/>
      Further, a source electrode 59 is formed in the source contact hole, and a drain electrode 60 is formed in the drain contact hole.
    </p>
    <p num="47">FIG. 4b is similar to FIG. 4a, except that a semiconductor substrate 50a such as a polysilicon is used instead of insulating substrate 50 in FIG. 2a. Accordingly, since semiconductor substrate 50a is used in FIG. 4b, an insulating layer 61 is provided between gate electrode 51, source region 54 and drain region 55, and semiconductor substrate 50a for electrical isolation.</p>
    <p num="48">A method of manufacturing the thin film transistor according to the second embodiment will now be described with reference to FIGS. 5a to 5e, wherein the TFT is formed on a semiconductor substrate, preferably polysilicon.</p>
    <p num="49">As described in the first embodiment, the process for manufacturing the TFT on an insulating substrate is similar to that used to manufacture the TFT on a semiconductor substrate except the step of forming an insulating layer on the substrate is omitted.</p>
    <p num="50">
      As shown in FIG. 5a, a substrate insulating layer 71, a conductive polysilicon 72, and a first insulating layer 73 (preferably a CVD silicon nitride film) are successively formed on the entire surface of a semiconductor substrate 70.
      <br/>
      First insulating layer 73 is patterned using a mask for defining a gate, thereby forming a first insulating layer pattern 73a.
      <br/>
      Next, using first insulating layer pattern 73a and sidewall spacers 74a as an etch mask, conductive layer 72 is etched to form a conductive gate electrode pattern 72a.
    </p>
    <p num="51">As shown in FIG. 5b, a second insulating layer 74 (preferably a CVD silicon oxide film) is formed on the exposed surface of first insulating layer pattern 73a and conductive layer 72, and etched by reactive ion etching (RIE), thereby forming sidewall spacers 74a on the sidewalls of first insulating layer pattern 73a.</p>
    <p num="52">
      After removing sidewall spacers 74a, local oxidation is carried out at edge portions of gate electrode 72a exposed after removal of sidewall spacers 74a.
      <br/>
      As a result, insulating films 75a and 75b, which are thermal oxide films, are formed on both edge portions E1 and E2.
      <br/>
      Gate electrode 72a thus has a mesa structure.
      <br/>
      That is, each of edge parts E1 and E2 of gate electrode 72a has a slope slanted downwardly away from portion M. A photoresist pattern PR5 is then provided on one of the edge portions of gate electrode 72 to selectively mask insulating film 75a, as shown in FIG. 5c.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      As shown in FIG. 5d, insulating film 75b disposed on the other edge part E2 of gate electrode 72a, which is not masked by photoresist pattern PR5, is removed, followed by removal of photoresist pattern PR5.
      <br/>
      Here, insulating film 75a remaining on edge portion E1 of gate insulating layer 78 underlies part of active region 77 (to be described below).
      <br/>
      Thereafter, a third insulating layer 75 (a gate insulating layer), a semiconductor layer (e.g., a polysilicon active region 77), and an impurity-doped insulating layer 78 are successively formed on insulating layer 71.
      <br/>
      Impurity-doped insulating layer 78 (preferably a boron silicate glass (BSG) or a boron phosphorous silicate glass (BPSG)) is etched to expose the surface of the mid portion M of gate electrode 7a facing part of active region 77 corresponding to the remaining portion of insulating film 75a.
      <br/>
      That is, parts of active region 77 used as channel and off-set regions are exposed, while other parts which will be used as a source region and a drain region are in contact with the impurity doped insulating layer 78a.
      <br/>
      Insulating film 75a is formed so as to be much thicker than that of third insulating layer 76 serving as the gate insulating layer.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The impurity doped insulating layer is then annealed to diffuse boron impurities from impurity doped insulating layer 78a into portions of active region 77 in contact with layer 78a to form source region 79 and drain region 80.
      <br/>
      Portions of active region 77 where the boron impurities did not diffuse correspond to channel region 81 and offset region 82 of the completed device.
      <br/>
      In particular, as shown in FIG. 5d, channel region 81 is disposed on mid portion M of gate electrode 72a, and offset region 82 overlies remaining insulating film 75a.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 5e, a fourth insulating layer 83 having a planarized surface is formed on remaining impurity-doped insulating layer 78 and an exposed part of active region 77.
      <br/>
      Remaining impurity-doped insulating layer 78a and fourth insulating layer 83 are then patterned together, thereby forming a source contact hole and drain contact hole on source region 79 and drain region 80, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      A conductive layer 84 is then formed on the contact holes and on fourth insulating layer 83 so as to completely fill the source contact hole and drain contact hole.
      <br/>
      Conductive layer 84 is then patterned to thereby form a source electrode 85 and a drain electrode 86, which are connected with source region 79 and drain region 80, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="57">Since the operation of the thin film transistor of the present invention is the same as that of the conventional thin film transistor, further description of the operation is omitted.</p>
    <p num="58">As described above, the structure and manufacturing process of the TFT's in accordance with the first and second embodiments of the present invention have the following advantages.</p>
    <p num="59">
      First, the potential of the off-set region is controlled by the gate electrode voltage.
      <br/>
      Thus, the on-current is enhanced in the "On" state.
      <br/>
      In the "Off" state, however, the electric field is diminished due to the thermal oxide film disposed below the off-set region.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the off-current is decreased.
      <br/>
      As a result, the on/off current ratio is improved and performance of the TFT is enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Secondly, the self-alignment method of the second embodiment defining the offset region uses a remaining portion of the insulating film.
      <br/>
      Thus, channel leakage current and variation of threshold voltage can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="61">Accordingly, the reliability of the thin film transistor is improved.</p>
