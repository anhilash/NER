      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="4">The present invention is directed generally to dynamic random access memory cells, and, more particularly, to dynamic random access memory cells with a junction device in the storage unit to reduce leakage from the storage unit.</p>
    <p num="5">2. Description of the Background</p>
    <p num="6">
      Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices have become widely accepted in the semiconductor industry.
      <br/>
      DRAM's typically cost less to produce than other types of memory devices due to their relative simplicity.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      At a fundamental level, a DRAM memory cell, or memory bit, consists of one transistor and one capacitor.
      <br/>
      When the transistor and capacitor are fabricated on a semiconductor substrate, a number of junctions between adjacent materials are formed.
      <br/>
      Junctions may be classified as homojunctions or heterojunctions.
      <br/>
      Homojunctions are junctions formed by doping a uniform body of semiconductor material.
      <br/>
      Thus, doped material adjacent to undoped material, or two adjacent areas of material that are doped differently from one another, form homojunctions.
      <br/>
      Heterojunctions are formed by two different semiconductor materials which are adjacent.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      One way to understand a junction is to examine the electron energy band diagram for the junction.
      <br/>
      Such a diagram illustrates the energy band levels of the materials of the junction with the potential barrier between the two sides of the junction being indicative of the degree of difficulty an electron will have in traveling from one side to the other.
      <br/>
      The larger the barrier, the greater the degree of difficulty.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      It is known that the size of the barrier, i.e., the characteristics of the junction, can be varied by the application of electric fields.
      <br/>
      Thus, under certain circumstances, the barrier may be large while under others the barrier may be small.
      <br/>
      Those characteristics have enabled heterojunction devices to act as storage devices.
      <br/>
      See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,740,620 entitled "Storage System Having Heterojunction--Homojunction Devices", and U.S. Pat. No. 3,739,356 entitled "Heterojunction Information Storage Unit."
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      DRAM devices are typically fabricated of homojunctions.
      <br/>
      To enable a quick read to or write from the memory cell, it is desirable to have a small electron barrier.
      <br/>
      However, small electron barriers mean high leakage rates, i.e. electrons traveling across the barrier when they aren't supposed to.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is an engineering tradeoff between speed and leakage rates.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      DRAM cells of the prior art all exhibit charge leakage such that the information stored in the cell must be periodically refreshed.
      <br/>
      The more often the cell is refreshed, the slower the memory operates and the more power it consumes.
      <br/>
      High frequency refresh operations also introduce noise into the array.
      <br/>
      Thus, the need exists for a DRAM memory circuit that has reduced charge leakage from the storage node.
      <br/>
      That translates into a lower refresh frequency, higher operating speeds, and lower power consumption.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">The present invention, according to its broadest implementation, is directed to a memory cell which incorporates a diode between a switching device and a storage node to reduce charge leakage from the storage node.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The present invention also contemplates a solid state memory cell which comprises a storage capacitor, a transistor, and a junction fabricated between the storage capacitor and the transistor.
      <br/>
      The present invention further contemplates an array of such memory cells comprised of a plurality of column lines and row lines interconnecting the memory cells and a plurality of sense amplifiers and precharge circuits connected between the column lines.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention may also be part of a complete memory device which itself may be part of a system.
      <br/>
      The system may comprise a processor, read and write control logic, a plurality of memory cells, a plurality of column lines and row lines interconnecting the plurality of memory cells, and a plurality of sense amplifiers and precharge circuits connected between the column lines.
    </p>
    <p num="15">The present invention also contemplates a method of controlling charge transfer to and from a storage node through a switching device.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention represents a substantial advance over prior memory cells and methods of controlling charge transfer to and from a storage node through a switching device.
      <br/>
      Because the present invention incorporates a diode between the switching device and the storage node, the leakage from the storage node is reduced and memory refresh frequency is reduced.
      <br/>
      Those advantages and benefits of the present invention, and others, will become apparent from the Detailed Description of the Invention hereinbelow.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">
      It is to be understood that the figures and descriptions of the present invention have been simplified to illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the present invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, many other elements found in a typical memory system.
      <br/>
      Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other elements are desirable and/or required to implement the present invention.
      <br/>
      However, because such elements are well known in the art, and because they do not facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, a discussion of such elements is not provided herein.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A portion of a schematic of a typical prior art DRAM array 8 is shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Four memory cells 10, 12, 14, and 16 are shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The cells 10, 12, 14, and 16 are connected in rows to row lines, or word lines, and are connected in columns to column lines, or digit lines.
      <br/>
      Each cell in the array 8 is identified by a binary row address and a binary column address.
      <br/>
      The array 8 as depicted in FIG. 1 is comprised of four digit lines which make up two column lines.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As can be seen in FIG. 1, each of the memory cells 10, 12, 14 and 16 is comprised of a transistor 18 and a capacitor 20.
      <br/>
      Information, generally an intermediate voltage value that is between the voltage values for a logic "1" or a logic "0", is stored in the capacitor 20.
      <br/>
      Such voltage values may be, for example, Vcc/2 and -Vcc/2, respectfully.
      <br/>
      The stored value is an intermediate value because of the resistive and capacitive effects of the memory array 8.
      <br/>
      A first column line 22 and a second column line 24 comprise a pair of column lines, which is sometimes referred to as a column.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A P-sense amplifier 26 acts as an active pull-up circuit.
      <br/>
      It is enabled by PE1 signal 28 through device 30, and provides a pull-up voltage to the column lines 22 and 24.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The cells 10, 12, 14 and 16 are connected to and enabled by row lines 32, 34, 36 and 38, respectively.
      <br/>
      Only one of the row lines 32, 34, 36 and 38 is active at a time.
      <br/>
      When each of the active row lines 32, 34, 36 and 38 is active, the row line connects the respective cell to either the column line 22 or the column line 24.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A precharge circuit 40, which is enabled by EQP signal 42, establishes equilibration voltages and set-up conditions on the digit lines 22 and 24.
      <br/>
      An N-sense amplifier 44 acts as an active pull-down circuit.
      <br/>
      It is enabled by the RNL signal 46 and NLAT signal 48 through device 50, and provides a pull-down voltage to the column lines 22 and 24.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Precharge circuit 52 is enabled by EQC signal 54.
      <br/>
      The precharge circuit 52 operates similarly to the precharge circuit 40. P-sense amplifier 56 is enabled through device 58 by PE2 signal 60.
      <br/>
      The P-sense amplifier 56 operates similarly to the P-sense amplifier 26.
      <br/>
      Column decoder 62 selects a column to be addressed in the array 8.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 2 shows a cross section of the physical layout of the memory cells 10 and 14 from FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      If the cross section shown in FIG. 2 were divided roughly in half along a vertical axis, the memory cell 10 would be to the left of the bisection and the memory cell 14 would be to the right of the bisection.
      <br/>
      The memory cells 10 and 14 are constructed on a substrate 70, typically a silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      Field oxide regions 72 are grown on the substrate 70, typically by a LOCOS process, and active areas 74 are diffused into the substrate 70.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Gate access regions 78 are typically constructed of polysilicon.
      <br/>
      The gate access regions 78 are surrounded at their sides by spacer regions 79.
      <br/>
      Storage nodes 80 are constructed of polysilicon, and function as the storage areas for the capacitors 20 of FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Dielectric layers 82 are formed on top of the storage nodes 80.
      <br/>
      The dielectric layers 82 are typically constructed of an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) dielectric.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the dielectric layers 82 is chosen such that maximum capacitance is obtained and charge leakage is reduced in order to optimize refresh.
      <br/>
      Cellplates 84, which are typically constructed of polysilicon, form top plates over the dielectric layers 82.
      <br/>
      The cellplates 84 are shared by all capacitors in a row line.

      Due to the inherent physical properties of the memory cells 10 and 14 of FIG. 2, the capacitors 20 exhibit charge leakage.

      Thus, the stored values in the memory cells 10 and 14 must be periodically refreshed to prevent the stored voltage values from becoming logically indistinguishable.
      <br/>
      Higher frequencies of memory cell refresh means that noise is introduced into the array more frequently.
