      <br/>
      An apparatus and method for sterilizing devices having contact areas with an antimicrobial fluid such as hydrogen peroxide.
      <br/>
      If the device is a lumen, the lumen is held in an adaptor which is connected with a vessel containing the antimicrobial fluid.
      <br/>
      The lumen, adaptor, and vessel containing the antimicrobial fluid are placed in a sterilization chamber.
      <br/>
      When the sterilization chamber is evacuated, the antimicrobial fluid in the vessel volatilizes, thereby sterilizing the interior of the lumen.
      <br/>
      The adaptor has one or more features which improve the sterilization of the areas of contact between the adaptor and the lumen. 1.
      <br/>
      The surface of the adaptor which is in contact with the lumen can be textured or uneven so as to reduce surface contact and enhance bidirectional diffusion of the sterilant. 2.
      <br/>
      The adaptor can be made of a material which has minimal chemical and physical interaction with the sterilant. 3.
      <br/>
      The material from which the adaptor is prepared can be permeable to the sterilant so that the sterilant can penetrate the adaptor to sterilize any areas of contact.
      <br/>
      These features can be used singly or in combination to improve the sterilization of the areas of contact.
      <br/>
      These modifications can also be applied to any holder for equipment to be sterilized or to a medical device made of two or more pieces where there are contact areas between the parts, such as forceps.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to the sterilization of articles such as medical instruments having long narrow lumens, and, more particularly, to an apparatus and method for delivering an antimicrobial fluid more effectively to contact surfaces within an instrument or between an instrument and the device which holds it during the sterilization process.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Articles such as medical instruments should be sterilized before use.
      <br/>
      There are many methods of sterilization, including heat and chemical methods.
      <br/>
      Heat sterilization is normally done using steam.
      <br/>
      Some equipment cannot withstand either the heat or the moisture from steam treatment.
      <br/>
      As a result, chemical sterilization is now commonly used.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Chemical sterilization uses a sterilizing fluid such as hydrogen peroxide, ethylene oxide, chlorine dioxide, peracetic acid, or a combination thereof.
      <br/>
      A plasma may be induced to enhance the sterilization process.
      <br/>
      Although chemical sterilization is normally highly effective, it may not be as effective with medical devices containing long, narrow tubes, or lumens.
      <br/>
      Sterilization of these long lumens requires that the sterilizing agent penetrate the entire length of the long narrow tube.
      <br/>
      It is difficult for the sterilizing agent to completely penetrate these long narrow tubes.
      <br/>
      In order to enhance the penetration of the sterilizing agent down the entire length of the lumen, several forms of apparatus have been developed to flow sterilizing agent through the length of the lumen, thus enhancing the effectiveness of the sterilizing treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,410,492 and 4,337,223 describe a sterilization method in which the lumen is placed in a socket connected to a valve and a recirculating pump.
      <br/>
      The sterilizing gas is recirculated from the sterilization chamber through the lumen of the instrument.
      <br/>
      Although the method is effective at sterilizing the lumen, sterilization of endoscopes requires 2-3 hours using ethylene oxide as the sterilizing gas.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A method which delivers sterilizing agent down long, narrow lumens is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,530. The lumen is inserted into an adaptor connected to a vessel containing hydrogen peroxide called the booster.
      <br/>
      The lumen, adaptor, and booster are all placed in the sterilization chamber.
      <br/>
      When the sterilization chamber is evacuated during the sterilization procedure, the hydrogen peroxide in the booster vaporizes and passes through the lumen, thereby sterilizing the interior of the lumen.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      During use of the various sterilization methods, the lumen is held by a connecting device, a socket in the case of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,410,492 and 4,337,223 or a truncated cone adaptor when using the method of U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,530. In all cases, there are areas of contact between the device and the lumen where the lumen attaches to the connecting device.
      <br/>
      It is difficult for the sterilizing agent to penetrate into these contact areas.
      <br/>
      There is a need for a method of enhancing the penetration of sterilizing gas into these contact areas more effectively to allay any potential concerns about incomplete sterilization.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="22">
      The method and device of the present invention relates to the sterilization of articles such as medical instruments having a lumen or to any medical instrument having contact surfaces.
      <br/>
      In addition, the method and device apply to any situation in which an article to be sterilized is in contact with an external housing or other device where there are points of contact between the external housing and the article.
      <br/>
      Finally, the method applies to medical devices having two or more parts, where there are points of contact between the two parts.
      <br/>
      Each of these embodiments will be discussed in turn.
      <br/>
      The terms "sterilize, sterilant", and other forms of this word throughout the specification and claims are to be construed broadly and to include disinfection and other antimicrobial processes.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The first embodiment of the present invention is for the sterilization of lumens or medical instruments having one or more lumens.
      <br/>
      The term instruments having one or more lumens as used herein applies to medical or surgical devices such as endoscopes, catheters, tubing, or similar instruments or articles having one or more internal lumens.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment of the device and method of the present invention, antimicrobial fluid may be supplied directly to the lumen or interior of the tube of the instrument during the sterilization process.
      <br/>
      In general, the lumen is held by an adaptor which is connected to a source of antimicrobial agent.
      <br/>
      There are contact surfaces between the adaptor and the lumen.
    </p>
    <p num="24">To enhance the sterilization of the contact surfaces, one or a combination of the following properties may be utilized in the adaptor or connector design or material selection: first, applying texture or uneven surfaces to the contact area so as to reduce surface contact and enhance axial diffusion of sterilant; second, constructing the adaptor or connector, at least in the contact area, from a material which has minimal chemical and physical interaction with the sterilant; and third, using a material of construction, at least in the contact area, which is permeable to the sterilant so that the sterilizing agent can penetrate the material, thereby enhancing radial diffusion of the sterilant.</p>
    <p num="25">
      FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a form of apparatus suitable for use in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows the assembled apparatus, and FIG. 2 is an exploded view, showing the various parts of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      A booster 20 is attached to an adaptor 30.
      <br/>
      A lumen 50 is inserted into an opening 32 of the adaptor 30.
      <br/>
      The opening 32 is normally of slightly smaller diameter than the outer diameter of the lumen 50 so that there is a snug fit between the inside of the opening 32 and the outside of the lumen 50.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Two forms of the booster 20 are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,530 in col. 9 line 11 to col. 12, line 19 and FIGS. 5 to 13, herein incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      Briefly, the booster 20 comprises a vessel for containing hydrogen peroxide, a membrane wall capping the vessel containing the hydrogen peroxide, and an opener with a hollow spike which is used to breach the membrane wall to activate the booster so that the hydrogen peroxide can escape from the vessel.
      <br/>
      One form of the booster is shown as 100 on FIGS. 5 to 9 and an alternative form as 200 on FIGS. 10 and 11 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,530.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The adaptor 30 is shown in more detail in FIG. 3A herein.
      <br/>
      The adaptor 30 comprises a cylindrical tubular body 34, an inwardly facing annular flange 36 for firmly attaching the cylindrical tubular body 34 to the booster 20, a truncated cone 38, the opening 32, and texturing 40 on the outer surface of the truncated cone 38 surrounding the opening 32.
      <br/>
      The adaptor has one or a combination of the following properties.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      First, texturing can be added to the contact surface.
      <br/>
      The texturing can take various forms such as ridges, concentric rings, uneven surfaces, projections having equal heights, projections with varying heights, etc.
      <br/>
      Whatever form of texturing is used, there can be a plurality of the ridges, rings, or projections of equal or varying heights.
      <br/>
      The height of the texturing varies and is related to the viscosity of the antimicrobial fluid.
      <br/>
      The height of the texture varies from 0.01 millimeters to 50 millimeters.
      <br/>
      The height of the texture for an antimicrobial fluid which is a gas will generally be less than for an antimicrobial fluid which is a liquid, because a gas has a lower viscosity than a liquid.
      <br/>
      Although the height of the texturing can be determined by one skilled in the art, in general, a height of 0.1 millimeter is preferred for an antimicrobial agent which is a gas.
      <br/>
      The height of the texturing which is preferred for a liquid is normally in the range of 1 to 5 millimeters, depending on the viscosity of the liquid.
      <br/>
      The texturing also preferably extends to the inside of the opening 32, so that the area directly facing the lumen 50 is textured as well as the outer surface of the truncated cone 38 surrounding the opening 32.
      <br/>
      The portion of the truncated cone 38 which is textured is in the range of 0.01 to 50 millimeters, radially extending from the edge of the opening 32.
      <br/>
      The inwardly facing annular flange 36 fits into a shallow annular groove on the booster 20 when the adaptor 30 is fitted into place on the booster, thereby firmly attaching the adaptor 30 to the booster 20.
      <br/>
      Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the dimensions of the truncated cone 38 and the opening 32 can be varied to accommodate various types of instruments to be sterilized.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Second, the material, at least in the contact area, can have minimum chemical and physical interaction with the sterilant or sterilizing agent.
      <br/>
      Chemical interaction includes chemical reaction or catalytic decomposition of the sterilant.
      <br/>
      Physical interaction includes absorption or adsorption of the sterilant by the material.
      <br/>
      Third, the material, at least in the contact area, can be permeable to the sterilant so that the antimicrobial fluid can penetrate through the material.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Suitable materials for fabricating the adaptor, at least in the contact area, can include, but are not limited to, polyolefins (including thermoplastic elastomers), fluorinated and/or chlorinated polyolefins (including thermoplastic elastomers), fluorovinylidene, chlorovinylidene, liquid crystal polymers such as wholly aromatic polyester or polyester-amide, silicone rubber, or fluorinated silicone rubber.
      <br/>
      These materials can be mixed with one or more fillers which have minimum chemical/physical interactions with the chemical sterilant.
      <br/>
      Fillers are usually added to enhance mechanical, electrical, or thermomechanical properties.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The following procedure may be used when sterilizing equipment with the booster 20 and the adaptor 30.
      <br/>
      An appropriately sized adaptor 30 is selected for the particular lumen 50 or other equipment to be sterilized.
      <br/>
      The adaptor 30 is attached to the booster 20, and the lumen 50 or other instrument to be sterilized is inserted into the opening 32.
      <br/>
      The booster 20 is activated, and the hydrogen peroxide or other sterilizing agent is free to enter the adaptor 30 and the interior of the lumen 50 or instrument.
      <br/>
      In general practice, the activated booster 20, adaptor 30, and lumen 50 are placed into a sterilization chamber, the chamber is sealed, and the chamber is evacuated, preferably to 100 torr or less.
      <br/>
      An antimicrobial fluid is then injected into the chamber, where it vaporizes and contacts the exposed surface of the equipment.
      <br/>
      Various factors known to those skilled in the art can be used to enhance sterilization such as heat, plasma, or high frequency radiation.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The hydrogen peroxide or other antimicrobial fluid in the booster 20 volatilizes when the chamber is evacuated and enters the adaptor 30 and the lumen 50, thereby sterilizing the interior of the lumen.
      <br/>
      The exterior of the lumen is sterilized by the antimicrobial agent which is injected into the chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate the use of the adaptor 30 with a lumen 50.
      <br/>
      One skilled in the art can appreciate that the size of the opening 32 on the adaptor can be varied, depending on the size of the lumen or other equipment connected to the adaptor 30.
      <br/>
      The body of the adaptor can have shapes other than a cylinder, depending on the shape of the booster.
      <br/>
      For example, a rectangular adaptor would be used if the booster were rectangular.
      <br/>
      Similar modifications would be obvious to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The adaptor 30 can have several features which make the sterilization of the lumen even more effective than with previous devices.
      <br/>
      Some of these features are illustrated in FIG. 4, which is a blowup of FIG. 3B, showing the area of contact between the lumen 50 and the adaptor 30.
      <br/>
      First, the areas of contact between the adaptor 30 and the lumen 50 or other medical device can be reduced by using textured surfaces on the adaptor 30.
      <br/>
      Thus, the opening 32 and the part of the truncated cone 38 which can contact the lumen 50 can be textured.
      <br/>
      This is shown on FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Only the tips of the texturing devices remain as areas of contact between the adaptor 30 and the lumen 50.
      <br/>
      This contact area is far less than if the texturing were not present.
      <br/>
      In addition, there are small gaps between the ridges or "bumps", which create an uneven surface.
      <br/>
      The antimicrobial agent can enter these gaps and reach areas which would otherwise be inaccessible.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Finally, if the material used to construct the adaptor 30 is permeable to the antimicrobial agent, typically hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, or chlorine dioxide, further enhancement of the sterilization effectiveness can be achieved.
      <br/>
      The antimicrobial agent thus penetrates the adaptor 30 to reach any areas of contact between the adaptor 30 and the lumen 50 or other instrument which remain after these contact areas are minimized through surface texturing.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows arrows illustrating the penetration of the sterilant vapor to the contact areas both through the gaps between the unevenness of the texturing and through the permeable material from which the adaptor 30 can be fabricated.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The effectiveness of penetration of the antimicrobial agent through the material of the adaptor to the contact areas can be even further enhanced by making the adaptor thinner in the contact areas than in the remainder of the adaptor.
      <br/>
      For example, in FIGS. 3A and 4, the wall thickness of the truncated cone 38 of the adaptor 30 decreases from the outer end 42 to the opening 32.
      <br/>
      The portion of the truncated cone 38 which is in contact with the lumen 50 is the thinnest part of the truncated cone, and the antimicrobial agent can penetrate to the contact area between the adaptor and the lumen more effectively than if the adaptor in this area were thicker.
      <br/>
      Making the adaptor thinner in the contact areas than in the remainder of the adaptor is a way to further enhance the penetration of the antimicrobial agent through the material of the adaptor into the contact area Although this is a preferred embodiment, it is not a required feature.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      By using one or a combination of these features in the adaptor 30, the antimicrobial agent can penetrate the areas of contact between the adaptor 30 and the lumen 50 more effectively than in previous designs.
      <br/>
      These features include: applying texture or uneven surfaces to the contact area so as to reduce surface contact and enhance bidirectional diffusion of sterilant; using a material which has minimal chemical and physical interaction with the sterilant; and forming the adaptor from a material that is permeable to the sterilant so that the sterilizing agent can penetrate the material.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The methods of the present invention can be used whenever there are areas of contact between an article to be sterilized through sterilization and a connecting device for the article.
      <br/>
      Often, the connecting device will have an aperture through which the article is inserted.
      <br/>
      There are areas of contact between the aperture of the connecting device and the article to be sterilized.
      <br/>
      The article to be sterilized can comprise a lumen, rod, or other device.
      <br/>
      The methods of the present invention can be used in the connecting device and/or the article to be sterilized.
      <br/>
      These methods include the use of texturing on the areas of the connecting device which contact the device to be sterilized in order to reduce the contact area between the article and the connecting device.
      <br/>
      Second, the connecting device can be made of a material which is permeable to the antimicrobial agent so that any remaining contact surfaces can be sterilized by penetration of the antimicrobial agent through the material of the adaptor.
      <br/>
      Third, the selected material can be a material which has minimal physical and chemical interaction with the antimicrobial agent.
      <br/>
      Ways to optimize these design modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      These methods can also be used to enhance the penetration of antimicrobial agent to contact areas within a medical device.
      <br/>
      Often a medical device is made of two or more pieces.
      <br/>
      There are likely to be contact areas between the pieces from which the medical device is formed.
      <br/>
      One example of a medical device made up of two or more pieces and having contact areas is a pair of forceps.
      <br/>
      The methods of the present invention can be used to enhance the penetration of the antimicrobial agent to these contact areas.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      One or more of the pieces forming the medical device can incorporate the features of the present invention to enhance the penetration of the antimicrobial agent to the contact areas.
      <br/>
      These features include the use of texturing or uneven surfaces on one or more of the pieces forming the medical device in the contact areas between the two or more pieces.
      <br/>
      The texturing will help to reduce the contact area.
      <br/>
      Second, one or more of the pieces forming the medical device, at least in the contact area, can be made of a material which is permeable to the antimicrobial agent.
      <br/>
      Third, the material selected to form one or more of the pieces forming the medical device, at least in the contact area, can be a material which has minimal physical and chemical interaction with the antimicrobial agent.
      <br/>
      Any one or a combination of these features can be used to enhance the penetration of the antimicrobial agent to the contact areas between the two or more pieces forming a medical device.

      The antimicrobials used with the methods and devices of the various embodiments of the present invention include solutions of glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, peracetic acid, or other antimicrobials in an inert medium.
