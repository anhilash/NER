    <p num="1">
      This application is a U.S. national application of international application serial No. PCT/US98/15518 filed Jul. 23, 1998, which claims priority to U.S. provisional application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 60/053,607 filed Jul. 23, 1997.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a fuel cap, and particularly to a fuel cap for closing a vehicle fuel tank filler neck.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to an electrically conductive fuel cap.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Occasionally, vehicle occupants or service station attendants will "carry" a static electricity charge having an electrical potential that is higher than the vehicle itself.
      <br/>
      A fuel cap in accordance with the present invention is configured to "ground" a person turning the fuel cap relative to the filler neck so as to dissipate to ground, in a controlled manner, any electrostatic charge or potential on the person during rotation of a cover of the fuel cap relative to a filler neck-engaging base of the fuel cap at the outset of a vehicle refueling cycle and before fuel vapor is allowed to vent through the mouth of the filler neck.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The fuel cap includes a closure, a handle for turning the closure to engage and close the filler neck, and a conductor configured to conduct an electrical charge from the handle to the filler neck during rotation of the handle relative to the closure and before movement of the closure to break a seal established between the closure and the filler neck.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, the closure includes a closure member adapted to close the open mouth of the filler neck and a torque-transmission race configured to provide a lost-motion driving connection between the handle and the closure member.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the conductor includes a conductor pin mounted on the closure member and arranged to contact the filler neck and a conductor ring arranged to move relative to the closure member and the torque-transmission race and contact the conductor pin before the closure member is moved to open the filler neck.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the conductor includes an annular band coupled to the torque-transmission race to rotate therewith and a finger appended to the annular band and arranged to be moved by a boss on the handle to establish electrical contact between a tip of the finger and the filler neck before the closure member is moved to open the filler neck.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Additional features of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments exemplifying the best mode of carrying out the invention as presently perceived.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The detailed description particularly refers to the accompanying figures in which:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a fuel cap in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention showing a vehicle .fuel tank filler neck made of an electrically conductive material, for closing an open mouth of the filler neck, a pair of conductor pins fixed in the closure member and arranged to extend downwardly toward the filler neck, a conductor ring with two upright tabs above the closure, a torque-transmission race including a straight driven lug and an L-shaped driven lug, and a hollow handle made of an electrically conductive material and including a cover and a pair of integral, downwardly extending drive lugs arranged to engage the upright tabs on the conductor ring to drive the driven lugs on the torque-transmission race so as to establish a lost-motion driving connection between the handle, torque-transmission race, and the closure member;
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="7">
      A fuel cap 10 is configured to close and seal an open mouth 11 of a tank filler neck 12.
      <br/>
      Fuel cap 10 includes lost motion between a handle 14 and filler neck closure member 16 with a grounded connection made between handle 14, conductor, and filler neck 12 during the lost-motion phase of movement of handle 14 relative to filler neck 13 and filler neck closure member 16 so that cap 10 and the operator's hand become fully grounded before the sealed filler neck connection between closure member 16 and filler neck 12 is broken.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment of FIGS. 1-3, the handle-discharge conductor includes a conductor ring 15 and a pair of conductor pins 17.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Components of a fuel cap 10 for closing a filler neck 12 are illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Fuel cap 10 includes a shell or handle 14 used to rotate a closure member 16 to close filler neck 12.
      <br/>
      A torque-transmission race 18 is situated in between handle 14 and closure member 16 to transmit rotation from handle 14 to closure member 16 during installation on or removal from filler neck 12.
      <br/>
      The disclosure in Robert S. Harris' U. S. Pat. No. 5,449,086 entitled "Delayed Actuation Fuel Cap" is hereby incorporated by reference herein.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Handle 14 includes a top wall or cover 20 with a handle grip 22 formed in top wall 20.
      <br/>
      Handle grip 22 is used to impart rotational torque to cap 10 about an axis of rotation 24.
      <br/>
      Handle grip 22 includes upstanding side walls 26 arranged to lie parallel to each other and to extend upward from top wall 20 away from closure 16.
      <br/>
      Upstanding side walls 26 include a top edge to which an upper wall 30 is appended.
      <br/>
      Handle grip 22 bisects top wall 20 to create semicircular portions 32, 34.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Top wall 20 includes a perimeter edge 36 and a cylindrical side wall 38 is appended to perimeter edge 36 and arranged to extend downward toward housing 16.
      <br/>
      Six retaining lugs 40 are appended to cylindrical side wall 38 and function to couple closure member 16, torque-transmission race 18, and handle 14 together.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Drive pins 42, 44 are integrally appended to top wall 20 and extend downwardly from top wall 20 along an axis parallel to the axis of rotation 24.
      <br/>
      Each drive pin 42, 44 lies in its own semicircular portion 32, 34 so that drive pin 42 is situated in semicircular portion 32 and drive pin 44 is situated in semicircular portion 34.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated embodiment, drive pins 42, 44 are the ejector pins formed in the plastics molding process to manufacture handle 14.
      <br/>
      Once handle 14 is ejected from its mold, the ejector pins are cut to a predetermined length to form drive pins 42, 44.
      <br/>
      The length of drive pins 42, 44 is selected so that drive pins 42, 44 transmit rotation to annular torque transmission ring 18.
      <br/>
      Drive pins 42, 44 are cylindrical in shape and are hollow due to their function as ejector pins.
      <br/>
      In alternative embodiments, drive pins 42, 44 may be of a different length and shape and may be appended to handle 14 in a different location or manner.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Closure member 16 is configured to engage a filler neck 12 in a conventional manner.
      <br/>
      Filler neck 12 is made of an electrically conductive material such as a metal and terminates in an outwardly and downwardly extending sealing lip 46, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      An O-ring sealing gasket 48 is configured to seat against sealing lip 46 and closure member 16 to provide a fluid-tight seal between cap 10 and filler neck 12 when closure member 16 is fully engaged into filler neck 12.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Closure member 16 includes a small electrically conductive probe (e.g., conductor pins 17) extending through the plastic material forming closure member 16 so that the probe is in contact with metal portion 46 of filler neck 12 inside of O-ring gasket 48.
      <br/>
      When an operator touches cap 10 (e.g., handle 14), the operator immediately makes the conductivity connection with cover 20 which is not grounded; therefore no shock.
      <br/>
      As the operator turns cover 20 in full contact with cover 20, the operator then grounds cover 20 to metal conductor ring 15 and in turn to filler neck 46 discharging the electrical potential with no sparks and at the same time with cap 10 still sealed to filler neck 12 since cover 20 is in the "lost-motion portion" of the cap 10 travel and the sealed connection between closure member 16 and filler neck 16 at O-ring gasket 48 has not yet been broken.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to FIG. 1, handle 14, conductor ring 15, and conductor pins 17 are each made of an electrically conductive material.
      <br/>
      When conductive handle 14 contacts conductor ring 15 and conductor ring 15 contacts conductor pins 17, an electrical path is established to conduct static electricity from a user gripping handle 14 to metal filler neck 12 via an electrically conducted path established between handle 14, conductor ring 15, and conductor pins 17.
      <br/>
      Torque-transmission race 18 and filler neck-engaging housing or body 16 are both made of non-conductive materials.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      As shown best in FIG. 1, conductor ring 15 includes an annular member 81 and a pair of radially inwardly extending fingers 83 integrally appended to an inner edge of annular member 81.
      <br/>
      These somewhat straight fingers 83 extend toward one another as shown, for example, in FIG. 1 and are aligned along a major diameter of annular member 81.
      <br/>
      An upright tab 85 is appended to one side of each of fingers 83 to face in opposite directions as shown.best in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      As will be seen later, at a certain stage during fuel cap removal, the electrically conductive drive lugs 42, 44 appended to cover 20 of electrically conductive handle 14 will engage upright tabs 85 included in conductor ring 15 so that any electrical current will be able to flow through upright tabs 85, fingers 83, annular member 81 to conductor pins 17 by means of electrical contact between flat heads 87 of conductor pins 17 and the underside of annular member 81.
      <br/>
      In presently preferred embodiments of the present invention, conductor ring 15 is fixed to rotate with torque-transmission race 18 so as to be movable relative to handle 14 and closure member 16.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIG. 2, it will be seen that even during positioning of fuel cap 10 in its filler neck-closing position, the underside of annular member 81 of electrically conductive conductor ring 15 is retained in electrical contact and engagement with heads 87 of conductor pins 17.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the proximal or upper ends of pin shafts 83 are in contact with heads 87 and the distal or lower ends of pin shafts 89 are in electrical contact and engagement with sealing lip 46 of metal filler neck 12.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In FIG. 1, a pressure-vacuum valve assembly 50 is shown for illustrative purposes only in its conventional position disposed in closure 16.
      <br/>
      Pressure-vacuum valve assembly 50 controls the venting of fuel vapor from the fuel tank when the pressure within the tank reaches a predetermined, superatmospheric level.
      <br/>
      Pressure-vacuum valve assembly 50 also controls the venting of air into the fuel tank when the pressure in the tank decreases to a predetermined, subatmospheric level.
      <br/>
      Pressure-vacuum valve assembly 50 is a conventional unit, and well known to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In addition, it will be understood that the novel features of the present invention are unrelated to the function of pressure-vacuum valve assembly 50.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the inclusion of assembly 50 is shown for illustrative purposes only.
      <br/>
      Cap 10 of the present invention will function regardless of the inclusion or omission of a pressure-vacuum valve assembly similar to assembly 50.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Closure member 16 includes a radially outwardly extending flange 52 at an axially upper portion of closure member 16.
      <br/>
      Six peripherally and slightly axially. upwardly extending resilient fingers 54 are attached to flange 52, as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Each of resilient fingers 54 terminates in a pawl tooth 56.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, flange 52 snaps into the assembled position between retaining lugs 40 on cylindrical side wall 38 and annular torque-transmission race 18.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Annular torque-transmission race 18 includes an annular top wall 58, annular bottom wall 60, cylindrical inner edge 62, and a cylindrical outer edge 64.
      <br/>
      Annular torque-transmission race 18 is situated between handle 14 and closure member 16 and is bounded by cylindrical side wall 38 of handle 14, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Annular top wall 58 faces top wall 20 of handle 14.
      <br/>
      Annular bottom wall 60 includes pockets 66 that are formed between spaced-apart teeth 68, as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Each tooth includes an angled face 70 and an upright face 72.
      <br/>
      Annular bottom wall 60 cooperates with resilient fingers 54, and specifically angled faces 70 of spaced-apart teeth 68 engage pawl teeth 56 to provide a torque-overriding connection of annular torque-transmission race 18 to closure member 16 in a cap-advancing direction 74 to permit advancement of closure member 16 into filler neck 12.
      <br/>
      The torque-overriding connection prevents overtightening closure member 16 in filler neck 12.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In addition, upright faces 72 of spaced-apart teeth 68 engage pawl teeth 56 to provide a direct connection of annular torque-transmission race 18 to closure member 16 in a cap-removal direction 76 to permit removal of closure member 16 from filler neck 12.
      <br/>
      The cooperation of resilient fingers 54 and annular torque-transmission race 18 to provide the torque-overriding connection in one direction and the direct connection in the other direction is well known in the art, and is specifically described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,280,346 to Evans, the entire specification and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Cylindrical outer edge 64 lies adjacent to cylindrical side wall 38 of handle 14.
      <br/>
      Cylindrical inner edge 62 is concentric to cylindrical outer edge 64.
      <br/>
      Driven lugs 78, 80 are appended to cylindrical inner edge 62.
      <br/>
      Drive pins 42, 44 extend downward from top wall 20 into a region 84 bounded by cylindrical inner edge 62 and engage with driven lugs 78, 80 to transmit rotation from handle 14 to closure member 16 as shown in FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Drive pins 42, 44 and driven lugs 78, 80 also cooperate to provide a delayed actuation driving connection.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated embodiment, driven lugs 78, 80 are spaced apart 180 (degree)  to provide approximately 160 (degree)  of lost motion 82 that drive pins 42, 44 must travel through once they disengage a first driven lug 78 in a first direction and before they engage a second driven lug 80 in a second direction.
      <br/>
      In alternative embodiments, driven lugs 78, 80 may be spaced apart at any predetermined angular dimension to provide a desired lost motion distance 82.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In the illustrated embodiment, first driven lug 78 is straight and second driven lug 80 is L-shaped.
      <br/>
      Straight driven lug 78 extends radially inward toward axis of rotation 24 a predetermined distance from a proximal end 88 appended to cylindrical inner edge 62.
      <br/>
      Straight driven lug 78 includes side walls which extend radially outward toward axis of rotation 24 from proximal end 88 of straight driven lug 78.
      <br/>
      The side walls include a cap-removal side 90 and a cap-advancing side 92.
      <br/>
      Straight driven lug 78 is used to engage with a drive pin 42, 44 to transmit rotation from handle 14 to closure member 16.
      <br/>
      Cap-advancing side 92 "engages" drive pin 44 in a cap-advancing direction 74 and cap-removal side 90 "engages" drive pin 42 in a cap-removal direction 76.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      L-shaped driven lug 80 has a proximal end 94 appended to cylindrical inner edge 62 and a distal end 96. L-shaped driven lug 80 includes a first member 98 which extends from proximal end 94 radially outward toward axis of rotation 24 a predetermined distance and a second member 110 which extends from a distal end 112 of first member 98 circumferentially to distal end 96 of L-shaped driven lug 80. L-shaped driven lug 80 is used to engage with a drive pin 42, 44 to transmit rotation from handle 14 to closure member 16 and to create a pocket 114 for holding drive pin 42 during rotation in cap-advancing direction 74.
      <br/>
      An anti-drift retaining lug 116 is appended to distal end 96 of L-shaped driven lug 80 and extends radially outward from axis of rotation 24 to create a drive pin-retaining pocket 114 for releasably retaining drive pin 42.
      <br/>
      Drive pin-retaining pocket 114 holds drive pin 42 stationary when cap 10 is in its closed position as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      This ensures cap 10 will not lose the 160 (degree)  of lost motion 82 when cap 10 is in the closed position due to cap drifting or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      L-shaped driven lug 80 includes a retaining side 118 and a non-retaining side 120.
      <br/>
      Retaining side 118 is shaped to define drive pin-retaining pocket 114.
      <br/>
      When cap 10 is rotated in a cap-removal direction 76, drive pin 42 engages cap-removal side 90 of straight driven lug 78 and drive pin 44 engages non-retaining side 120 of L-shaped driven lug 80.
      <br/>
      When cap 10 is rotated in a cap-advancing direction 74, drive pin 42 engages retaining side 118 of L-shaped driven lug 80 and drive pin 44 engages cap-advancing side 92 of straight driven lug 80.
    </p>

    <p num="28">
      Assuming that cap 10 is removed from filler neck 12 and an operator (not shown) desires to insert cap 10 into filler neck 12, handle 14 is rotated in cap-advancing direction 74 (clockwise) through lost motion dimension 82 until drive pin 44 engages cap-advancing side 92 of straight driven lug 78 and drive pin 42 engages retaining side 118 of L-shaped driven lug 80.
      <br/>
      This cap-advancing orientation is shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In this position, drive pin 42 is releasably retained in drive pin-retaining pocket 114.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      This cap-advancing rotational movement acts to engage closure member 16 in filler neck 12 and rotatably advance closure member 16 toward gasket 48 and sealing lip 46 to seal filler neck 12.
      <br/>
      The rotational movement of handle 14, annular torque-transmission race 18, and closure member 16 in a cap-advancing direction 74 is continued until closure member 16 is fully engaged in filler neck 12 and gasket 48 is trapped between closure member 16 and filler neck 12.
      <br/>
      Further rotation of handle 14 in cap-advancing direction 74 results in annular torque-transmission race 18 rotating with respect to closure member 16 due to torque-overriding connection between annular torque-transmission race 18 and closure member 16 as described previously to prevent overtightening of closure member 16.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      To remove cap 10 form filler neck 12, the operator begins rotating handle 14 in cap-removal direction 76.
      <br/>
      Initial rotation of handle 14 in cap-removal direction 76 forces drive pin 42 out of drive pin-retaining pocket 114 without imparting any rotational movement to annular torque-transmission race 18 or closure member 16.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      As shown in FIG. 3, a user will turn handle 14 about axis of rotation 24 from the position wherein drive lugs 42, 44 engage driven lugs 78, 80 on torque-transmission race 18 as shown in solid in FIG. 3 to cause those drive lugs 42, 44 to rotate or move in direction 76 to assume a position (shown in phantom in FIG. 3) wherein drive lug 42 engages one of upright tabs 85 on conductor ring 15 and drive lug 44 engages another upright tab 85 on conductor ring 15.
      <br/>
      Such engagement of drive lugs 42, 44 and upright tabs 85 on conductor ring 15 establish an electrically conductive path between handle 14 and filler neck 12 through non-conductive torque-transmission race 18 and closure member 16.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As illustrated in FIG. 3, handle 14 is rotated approximately 160 (degree)  before drive pin 42 moves one upright tab 85 to engage cap-removal side 90 of straight driven lug 78 and drive pin 44 moves other upright tab 85 to engage non-retaining side 120 of L-shaped driven lug 80.
      <br/>
      Continued rotation of handle 14 about axis of rotation 24 in cap-removal direction 76 will impart direct rotational movement to closure member 16 to begin removing closure member 16 from filler neck 12.

    <p num="33">
      Another embodiment of a cap in accordance with the present invention is shown in FIGS. 4-10.

      <br/>
      Conductor 204 includes an annular band or base 215 and fingers 217.
      <br/>
      Bosses 202 formed on handle 14 operate to deflect fingers 217 relative to annular band 215 to contact filler neck 12 so electrical communication is established from handle 14 to filler neck 12 through conductor 204 during rotation of handle 14 relative to closure member 16 and filler neck 12 and before handle 14 turns closure member 16 relative to filler neck 12 to break the seal established between closure member 16 and filler neck 12.

      Filler neck-contact tips 226 are movable relative to base 215 between non-active positions shown, for example, in FIGS. 5, 6, 9, and 10 away from filler neck 12 to avoid electrical contact with filler neck 12 and active positions shown, for example, in FIGS. 7 and 8 engaging filler neck 12 to establish electrical contact with filler neck 12.
      <br/>
      Fingers 17 are made of a spring material normally to bias filler neck-contact tips 226 to their active positions until tips 226 are moved temporarily to their active positions during lost-motion rotation of handle 14 relative to closure (e.g., torque-transmission race 18 and closure member 16) of the type that occurs when a user first begins to rotate handle 14 in a cap-removal direction during an initial stage of vehicle refueling.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Assuming that cap 210 is removed from filler neck 12 and an operator 250 desires to insert cap 210 into filler neck 12, handle 14 is rotated in a cap-advancing direction 74 (clockwise) through the lost motion dimension--until drive pin 44 engages cap-advancing side 92 of straight driven lug 78 and drive pin 42 engages retaining side 118 of L-shaped driven lug 80.
      <br/>
      This cap-advancing orientation is shown in phantom in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      In this position, drive pin 42 is releasably retained in drive pin-retaining pocket 114.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The cap-advancing rotational movement acts to engage closure member 16 in filler neck 12 and rotatably advance closure member 16 toward gasket 48 and sealing lip 46 to seal filler neck 12.
      <br/>
      The rotational movement of handle 14, torque-transmission race 18, and closure member 16 in cap-advancing direction 72 is continued until closure member 16 is fully engaged in filler neck 12 and gasket 48 is trapped between closure member 16 and filler neck 12.
      <br/>
      Further, rotation of handle 14 in cap-advancing direction 74 results in torque-transmission race 18 rotating with respect to closure member 16 due to torque-overriding connection between torque-transmission race 18 and closure member 16, as previously described.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      To remove cap 210 from filler neck 12, operation 250 rotates handle 14 in a cap-removal direction 76, as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Initial rotation of handle 14 in cap-removal direction 76 forces drive pin 42 out of drive pin-retaining pocket 114 without imparting rotational movement to torque-transmission race 18 or closure member 16.
      <br/>
      Additionally, fingers 217 of conductor 204 are spaced apart from filler neck 12 a pre-determine distance 256.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Referring now to FIG. 8, as operator 250 continues to turn handle 14 about axis of rotation 24 in direction 76, bosses 202 of handle 14 engage fingers 217 of conductor 204 and urge fingers 217 radially inwardly toward filler neck 12 causing neck-contact tips 226 to engage filler neck 12.
      <br/>
      When conductive handle 14 presses conductor 204 into engagement with filler neck 12, an electrical path is established to conduct static electricity 252 from user 250 gripping handle 14 to metal filler neck 12 and thus ground 254 via an electrically conductive path established between handle 14, conductor 204, and filler neck 12.
      <br/>
      Continued lost-motion rotation of handle 14 relative to closure ember 16 and filler neck 12 causes bosses 202 to pass over fingers 217 of conductor 204, as shown in FIG. 10. Thus, bosses 202 allow fingers to disengage filler neck 12 before the seal between filler neck 12 and closure member 16 is broken.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      An alternative handle 314 suitable for use with fuel cap 210 in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 12. Handle 314 is formed similarly to handle 14 and like reference numerals are used to denote like components.
      <br/>
      Handle 314 is modified to include two internal bosses 302 on inner side wall 38.
      <br/>
      When fuel cap 210 is coupled to filler neck 12 fingers 217 of conductor 204 are spaced apart from filler neck 12 as shown in FIG. 11. Initial rotation of handle 314 in cap-removal direction 76 rotates bosses 302 of handle 314 into engagement with fingers 217 off conductor 204.
      <br/>
      Bosses 302 urge fingers 217 radially inwardly toward filler neck 12 causing neck-contact tips 226 to engage filler neck 12, as shown in FIG. 12. When conductive handle 314 presses conductor 204 into engagement with filler neck 12, an electrical path is established to conduct static electricity 252 from the user gripping handle 314 to metal filler neck 12 and thus ground 254 via an electrically conductive path established between handle 314, conductor 204, and filler neck 12.
      <br/>
      Continued lost-motion rotation of handle 14 relative to closure ember 16 and filler neck 12 causes bosses 302 to pass over fingers 217 of conductor 204.
      <br/>
      Thus, bosses 302 allow fingers to disengage filler neck 12 before the seal between filler neck 12 and closure member 16 is broken.
