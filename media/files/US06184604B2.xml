      A brake mechanism includes a reduction gear train, a motor structure, and a braking means.
      <br/>
      The reduction gear train transmits at least a rotation force in a first rotational direction supplied from a drive source.
      <br/>
      The reduction gear train is imparted with a returning tendency in a second rotational direction opposite to the first rotational direction.
      <br/>
      The motor structure has an output shaft rotatably connected to the reduction gear train.
      <br/>
      The braking means has field magnets, an armature coil, a braking circuit, and either one of a fixed resistor, a variable resistor, a rectifying diode, a Zener diode, a varister, a constant-current diode, a light-emitting diode, and a lamp bulb.
      <br/>
      The braking means generates a torque in the first rotational direction to the output shaft which, upon being disconnected from the drive source, rotates to return in the second rotational direction through the reduction gear train in accordance with the returning tendency, thereby suppressing a returning rotation speed of the reduction gear train.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a brake mechanism for suppressing the operation speed of an operation end such as a valve or damper provided with a return spring, and a powered actuator having this brake mechanism.</p>
    <p num="3">
      As a conventional powered actuator, a spring return type actuator having a valve or damper as the operation end is used.
      <br/>
      In this spring return type actuator, the rotation force of a drive motor is transmitted to the operation end through a reduction mechanism to increase the torque, thereby opening/closing the valve or damper constituting the operation end.
      <br/>
      The valve or damper is provided with a return spring.
      <br/>
      When power is not supplied to the drive motor because of a power failure or the like, the valve or damper is forcibly fully closed or opened with the force (restoration force) of the return spring.
      <br/>
      During the return operation of fully closing or opening the valve or damper forcibly, a braking force (brake torque) is effected to moderate impact generated during the full-closing or full-opening operation.
      <br/>
      An example of the braking method during this return operation includes the following and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      I. Inertia braking method employing weight
      <br/>
      II.
      <br/>
      Governor method utilizing friction
      <br/>
      III.
      <br/>
      Impeller method utilizing air resistance
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      I.
      <br/>
      Inertia Braking Method Employing Weight
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      With this method, as shown in FIG. 16A, a brake mechanism 1 having a disk 1-1 is rotationally connected midway along a power transmission line connected to an operation end.
      <br/>
      Weights 1-2A and 1-2B are arranged on the disk 1-1 and are connected to the rotation center through springs 1-3A and 1-3B.
      <br/>
      This increases the moment of inertia during the return operation and suppresses an increase in operation speed of the operation end.
      <br/>
      In this case, the moment of inertia can be changed by a centrifugal force, i.e., the rotation speed, and it is estimated that a brake torque TB be substantially constant with respect to a rotation speed N, as shown in FIG. 16B. Accordingly, the operation speed (return speed) of the operation end from the start of return to the end of return will show the characteristics as shown in FIG. 16C.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The characteristics shown in FIG. 16C are expressed by:
      <br/>
      d OMEGA /dt=(TS-TB)/J
    </p>
    <p num="8">The moment J of inertia increases in proportion to the second power of the speed, and the brake torque TB is constant regardless of the rotation speed.</p>
    <p num="9">II. Governor Method Utilizing Friction</p>
    <p num="10">
      With this method, as shown in FIG. 17A, a brake mechanism 2 having a case 2-1 is rotationally connected midway along a power transmission line connected to an operation end.
      <br/>
      Drums 2-2A and 2-2B are arranged in the case 2-1 and are connected to the rotation center through springs 2-3A and 2-3B.
      <br/>
      During the return operation, the drums 2-2A and 2-2B are pulled in the radially outward direction by a centrifugal force to generate friction between them and the case 2-1, thereby suppressing an increase in operation speed of the operation end.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is estimated that a brake torque TB increase from a rotation speed N0, with which the drums 2-2A and 2-2B start to cause friction with the case 2-1, in substantially proportional to a rotation speed N, as shown in FIG. 17B. Accordingly, the return speed of the operation end from the start of return to the end of return will show the characteristics as shown in FIG. 17C.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The characteristics shown in FIG. 17C are expressed by:
      <br/>
      d OMEGA /dt=(TS-TB)/J
    </p>
    <p num="12">The brake torque TB is constant when the rotation speed is equal to or smaller than a predetermined value, and is variable when the rotation speed exceeds the predetermined value.</p>
    <p num="13">III. Impeller Method Utilizing Air Resistance</p>
    <p num="14">
      With this method, as shown in FIG. 18A, a brake mechanism 3 having an impeller 3-1 is rotationally connected midway along a power transmission line connected to an operation end.
      <br/>
      During the return operation, the impeller 3-1 rotates to generate a braking force caused by an air resistance, thereby suppressing an increase in operation speed of the operation end.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is estimated that a brake torque TB increase in substantially proportional to a rotation speed N, as shown in FIG. 18B. Accordingly, the return speed of the operation end from the start of return to the end of return will show the characteristics as shown in FIG. 18C.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The characteristics shown in FIG. 18C are expressed by:
      <br/>
      d OMEGA /dt=(TS-TB)/J
    </p>
    <p num="16">The brake torque TB can be changed in accordance with the rotation speed.</p>
    <p num="17">
      According to the conventional spring return type actuators of this type, however, since a braking force proportional to the rotation speed N cannot be obtained in the inertia braking method I, a stable operation speed cannot be obtained in the return operation of an operation end.
      <br/>
      Since the portion for generating the braking force causes friction in the governor method II, performance degradation occurs due to the friction.
      <br/>
      Since a braking force with respect to a shape is limited in the impeller method III, a large braking force cannot be obtained, and a large shape is required to obtain a large braking force.
      <br/>
      In any method, the structure is complicated to change the return time of the operation end.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">It is an object of the present invention to provide a brake mechanism and a powered actuator, capable of obtaining a stable braking force proportional to a rotation speed.</p>
    <p num="19">It is another object of the present invention to provide a brake mechanism and a powered actuator, capable of obtaining a large braking force in a compact structure.</p>
    <p num="20">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a brake mechanism and a powered actuator, capable of changing the return time of an operation end.</p>
    <p num="21">In order to achieve the above objects of the present invention, there is provided a brake mechanism comprising a rotation transmitting mechanism for transmitting at least a rotation force in a first rotational direction supplied from a drive source, the rotation transmitting mechanism being imparted with a returning tendency in a second rotational direction opposite to the first rotational direction, a motor structure having an output shaft rotatably connected to the rotation transmitting mechanism, and braking means for generating a torque in the first rotational direction to the output shaft which, upon being disconnected from the drive source, rotates to return in the second rotational direction through the rotation transmitting mechanism in accordance with the returning tendency, thereby suppressing a returning rotation speed of the rotation transmitting mechanism.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="23">The present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="24">�First Embodiment�</p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 2 shows a powered actuator (spring return type actuator) according to the first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 2, reference numeral 10 denotes a valve serving as an operation end; 11, a return spring provided to the valve 10; 12, a drive motor; 13, a reduction gear train; 14, a DC motor structure; and 15, a braking circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      As the drive motor 12, a synchro motor having a clutch is used.
      <br/>
      While the clutch is connected, an output shaft 12-1 of the drive motor 12 is rotatably connected to the valve 10 through the reduction gear train 13.
      <br/>
      The reduction gear train 13 is constituted by a first-stage reduction gear 13-1 meshing with a pinion 12-2 press-fitted on the output shaft 12-1 of the drive motor 12, a second-stage reduction gear 13-2 meshing with the reduction gear 13-1, a third-stage reduction gear 13-3 meshing with the reduction gear 13-2, and a fourth-stage reduction gear 13-4 meshing with the reduction gear 13-3.
      <br/>
      When a drive motor not incorporating a clutch is used as the drive motor 12, a clutch is externally mounted.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      FIG. 1A shows the basic structure of the DC motor structure 14.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1A, the DC motor structure 14 has field magnets 14-1 and 14-2, an armature coil 14-3, and a brush 14-4.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, a pinion 14-6 is press-fitted on a rotating shaft (output shaft) 14-5 of an armature (not shown) on which the armature coil 14-3 is wound, and the pinion 14-6 meshes with the reduction gear 13-1.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the output shaft 14-5 of the DC motor structure 14 is rotatably connected midway along a transmission line that transmits power from the drive motor 12 to the valve 10 through the reduction gear train 13.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1A, terminals 14-7a and 14-7b connected to the brush 14-4 of the DC motor structure 14 are short-circuited in a braking circuit 15.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIG. 3 shows the spring return type actuator shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 3, reference numeral 12-3 denotes the motor coil of the drive motor 12; 12-4, a clutch coil incorporated in the drive motor 12; 16, an operation selector switch for switching the rotational direction of the drive motor 12; and 17, a rectifying circuit which receives power (AC power) to be supplied to the drive motor 12 as a shunt input and generates DC power to be supplied to the clutch coil 12-4.
      <br/>
      The rectifying circuit 17 and the clutch coil 12-4 constitute a clutch drive circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The operation of the spring return type actuator described above will be described with reference to the timing charts shown in FIGS. 4A to 4D. A case wherein the valve 10 is a proportional valve will be described.
      <br/>
      As the drive motor 12, one which can ensure the position of the valve 10 with the holding torque of the motor itself, when power is not supplied to the motor while the clutch is connected, is used.
      <br/>
      As the operation selector switch 16, one which can switch to a neutral position (neutral) C as well as to the A side (closed side) and B side (open side) is used.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As shown in FIG. 4B, at point t0, if the operation selector switch 16 is located at the neutral position, the AC power supply is in the power supply state (FIG. 4A) and the opening degree of the valve 10 is 50% (FIG. 4C).
      <br/>
      In this case, DC power is supplied to the clutch coil 12-4 through the rectifying circuit 17.
      <br/>
      Since the clutch incorporated in the drive motor 12 is connected, the opening degree of the valve 10 is ensured at 50% by the holding torque of the motor itself.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      From this state, at point t1, when the operation selector switch 16 is switched to the A side, as shown in FIG. 4B, the drive motor 12 is rotated in the reverse direction.
      <br/>
      This reverse rotation force is transmitted to the valve 10 through the reduction gear train 13 to move it in the closing direction.
      <br/>
      The reverse rotation force from the drive motor 12 is transmitted to the DC motor structure 14 through the reduction gear train 13 to rotate its output shaft 14-5.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      When the output shaft 14-5 of the DC motor structure 14 is rotated by an external force F, the DC motor structure 14 serves as a generator to cause a counter electromotive force.
      <br/>
      In this case, since the terminals 14-7a and 14-7b are short-circuited in the braking circuit 15, a current I generated in the armature coil 14-3 of the DC motor structure 14 is flowed to the armature coil 14-3.
      <br/>
      Fleming's left-hand rule is effected, and a torque (brake torque) TB in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation caused by the external force F is generated.
    </p>
    <p num="33">When the output shaft 14-5 of the DC motor structure 14 rotates upon reception of the reverse rotation force from the drive motor 12 as the external force F, a brake torque TB in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation caused by the external force F is generated during a period from t1 to t2, as shown in FIG. 4D. This brake torque TB is proportional to a rotation speed N, as shown in FIG. 1B. Since the rotation speed N at this time is low, the brake torque TB is not very large.</p>
    <p num="34">
      As shown in FIG. 4B, when the operation selector switch 16 is set at the neutral position C again at point t2, the reverse rotation of the drive motor 12 is stopped.
      <br/>
      In this case, the valve 10 is stopped at an opening degree of 20%, and this state with the opening degree of 20% is held by the holding torque of the drive motor 12.
      <br/>
      Since the drive motor 12 is stopped, the counter electromotive force generated in the DC motor structure 14 disappears, and the brake torque TB also disappears.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      As shown in FIG. 4B, when the operation selector switch 16 is switched to the B side at point t3, the drive motor 12 is rotated in the forward direction, and this forward rotation force is transmitted to the valve 10 through the reduction gear train 13 to operate the valve 10 in the opening direction.
      <br/>
      At this time, the forward rotation force from the drive motor 12 is transmitted to the DC motor structure 14 through the reduction gear 13-1 to rotate its output shaft 14-5.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Accordingly, with the forward rotation force from the drive motor 12 as the external force F, Fleming's left-hand rule is effected in the same manner as in reverse rotation of the drive motor 12.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4D, a brake torque TB in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation caused by the external force F is generated during a period from t3 to t4, as shown in FIG. 4D. This brake torque TB is proportional to the rotation speed N, as shown in FIG. 1C. Since the rotation speed N at this time is low, the brake torque TB is not very large.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      As shown in FIG. 4B, when the operation selector switch 16 is switched to the neutral position C at point t4, the forward rotation of the drive motor 12 is stopped.
      <br/>
      In this case, the valve 10 is stopped at an opening degree of 80%, and this state with the opening degree of 80% is held by the holding torque of the drive motor 12.
      <br/>
      Since the drive motor 12 is stopped, the counter electromotive force generated in the DC motor structure 14 disappears, and the brake torque TB also disappears.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Assume that a power failure occurs at point t5, as shown in FIG. 4A, and that AC power supply to the drive motor 12 is disconnected.
      <br/>
      In this case, although the drive motor 12 is stopped since the operation selector switch 16 is located at the neutral position C, as the power supply is OFF, DC power supply to the clutch coil 12-4 is disconnected, and the clutch is disconnected.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the holding torque caused by the drive motor 12 disappears, and the valve 10 tries to return in the closing direction at a high speed with the restoring force of the return spring 11.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      At this time, however, the restoring force of the return spring 11 is transmitted to the DC motor structure 14 through the reduction gear train 13, and the output shaft 14-5 of the DC motor structure 14 starts to rotate.
      <br/>
      At this time, during a period from t5 to t6, a brake torque TB in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation caused by the restoring force F supplied from the return spring 11 is generated in the DC motor structure 14, as shown in FIG. 4D. This brake torque TB is proportional to the rotation speed N, as shown in FIG. 1B. Since the rotation speed N at this time is high, the brake torque TB is large, and the return speed of the valve 10 is moderated largely.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The nearer the end of return, the more constant the return speed of the valve 10 from the start of return to the end of return becomes, as shown in FIG. 1D. The characteristics shown in FIG. 1D are expressed by:
      <br/>
      d OMEGA /dt=(TS( THETA )-TB)/J
    </p>
    <p num="41">The brake torque TB can be changed in accordance with the rotation speed.</p>
    <p num="42">When the return ends, the valve 10 is stopped at a position with an opening degree of 0% at point t6, as shown in FIG. 4C. Since the valve 10 is stopped, the counter electromotive force generated in the DC motor structure 14 disappears, and the brake torque TB also disappears.</p>
    <p num="43">
      As described above, according to this embodiment, the brake torque TB proportional to the rotation speed N can be obtained, so that a stable operation speed can be obtained during the return operation of the valve 10.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the load does not become very large during the normal operation (low-speed rotation) of the valve 10, and a large braking force acts during the return operation (high-speed rotation) to obtain a sufficiently long return time, thereby decreasing impact occurring in the full-closing operation.
      <br/>
      The brake torque TB is obtained not through friction, as in the governor method, but is obtained electrically.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the performance does not degrade, and a brake torque TB proportional to the rotation speed can be obtained stably.
      <br/>
      A large brake torque TB can be obtained with a compact structure without increasing the size as in the impeller method.

    <p num="44">
      Although the terminals 14-7a and 14-7b of the DC motor structure 14 are short-circuited in the braking circuit 15 in the above embodiment, they need not be always short-circuited.
      <br/>
      With short-circuiting, no loss is caused by a resistor, and the best braking efficiency can be obtained accordingly.
      <br/>
      The number of components is small to decrease the cost.
      <br/>
      The characteristics are the same both in the opening and closing directions, and the brake torque TB can be obtained in proportion to the rotation speed.
      <br/>
      Other than the short-circuiting method, methods to be described below are possible.
      <br/>
      These methods are basic ones and can be used alone as well as in combination of various types of methods.

      In the second embodiment, the drive motor 12 of the first embodiment shown in FIG. 2 is replaced with a DC drive motor (DC motor) 17.
      <br/>
      The DC motor 17 has two functions, i.e., the functions of the drive motor 12 and DC motor structure 14 shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The DC motor 17 does not incorporate a mechanical clutch, and its output shaft 17-1 is rotationally connected to a reduction gear train 13 through a pinion 17-2.
      <br/>
      Except for this, the arrangement of this actuator is similar to that shown in FIG. 2, so that portions that are identical to those in FIG. 2 are denoted by the same reference numerals as in FIG. 2, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted.

    <p num="63">FIG. 14 shows the spring return type actuator shown in FIG. 13. Referring to FIG. 14, reference numeral 18 denotes an ON/OFF switch arranged on the supply line of power (AC power) to the DC motor 17 to switch the operation; 19, a rectifying circuit 19 for generating DC power from AC power input through the ON/OFF switch 18; 20, a relay; and 20-1 and 20-2, the contacts of the relay 20.</p>
    <p num="64">
      With the state of the contacts 20-1 and 20-2 shown in FIG. 14, power is not supplied to the relay 20, i.e., the ON/OFF switch 18 is OFF.
      <br/>
      In this state, movable contacts S1 and S2 of the relay contacts 20-1 and 20-2 are connected to the braking circuit 15 side, and terminals 17-3a and 17-3b of the DC motor 17 are short-circuited through a braking circuit 15.
      <br/>
      In contrast to this, when the ON/OFF switch 18 is turned on, the movable contacts S1 and S2 of the contacts 20-1 and 20-2 are connected to the rectifying circuit 19 side, and DC power is supplied from the rectifying circuit 19 to the DC motor 17.
      <br/>
      In this circuit arrangement, the relay 20 and the relay contacts 20-1 and 20-2 constitute a mode selection circuit for performing mode selection between the drive mode and the brake mode.

      The operation of this spring return type actuator will be described with reference to the timing charts shown in FIGS. 15A to 15C.

      In this case, a valve 10 is used as an ON/OFF valve and is not held at an intermediate opening degree.

    <p num="66">
      As shown in FIG. 15A, when the operation selector switch 18 is OFF at point t0, the opening degree of the valve 10 is 0%.
      <br/>
      In this case, the movable contacts S1 and S2 of the relay contacts 20-1 and 20-2 are connected to the braking circuit 15 side, and the terminals 17-3a and 17-3b of the DC motor 17 are short-circuited through the braking circuit 15.

      Hence, DC power from the rectifying circuit 19 is supplied to the DC motor 17.

      The DC motor 17 is rotated in the forward direction, and its forward rotation force is transmitted to the valve 10 through the reduction gear train 13, so that the valve 10 operates in the opening direction, as shown in FIG. 15B.

      While the valve 10 operates in the opening direction, no brake torque TB is generated, as a matter of course.

      When AC power supply to the rectifying circuit 19 is disconnected, DC power supply to the DC motor 17 is also disconnected.

      The valve 10 accordingly tries to return in the closing direction at a high speed with the restoring force of the return spring 11.

      <br/>
      This brake torque TB is proportional to the rotation speed N. Since the rotation speed N at this time is large, the brake torque TB is large, and the return speed of the valve 10 is largely moderated.
      <br/>
      In other words, in this case, the DC motor 17 serves as the brake.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      As shown in FIG. 15B, the valve 10 is fully closed at point t4, and the brake torque TB disappears.

      The operation selector switch 18 stays OFF, and the movable contacts S1 and S2 of the relay contacts 20-1 and 20-2 remain to be connected to the braking circuit 15 side.
    </p>
    <p num="72">In the second embodiment as well, the braking circuit 15 need not always be short-circuited, and various types of methods identical to those described in the first embodiment are possible.</p>
    <p num="73">In the present invention, as the motor structure for obtaining the brake torque TB, a DC machine type motor (DC servo motor), a synchronous machine type motor (stepping motor, a brushless motor), or the like can be employed.</p>
    <p num="74">
      As has been described above, according to the present invention, at least during the return operation of the operation end, a torque in a direction opposite to the rotational direction is generated in the motor structure to suppress the operation speed of the operation end.

      A braking force proportional to the rotation speed can be stably obtained, and a large braking force can be obtained with a compact structure without increasing the size.
      <br/>
      If a variable resistor element is connected between the two terminals of the motor structure to form a braking means, the return time of the operation end can be changed by selecting the resistance of this variable resistor element.
