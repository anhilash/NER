      <br/>
      A rechargeable coffee or spice grinder having rechargeable batteries that are recharged by induction current supplied by a recharging station.
      <br/>
      The recharging station is plugged into a conventional a.c. wall outlet, such as in a kitchen, and has a charging probe that induces a charge in the charging unit of the grinder without any wires interconnecting the grinder to the station.
      <br/>
      The grinder's charging unit connect to rechargeable batteries that operate a motor.
      <br/>
      This motor is used to spin blades to grind an inserted food product placed in a basket within the grinder, such as coffee beans or spices.
      <br/>
      An opening on the bottom of the grinder serves as an input for the charging probe of the charging station.
      <br/>
      After material is ground, the grinder can be turned upside down which moves the material to the grinder's removable lid.
      <br/>
      The lid is used to store and transport the ground material, like ground coffee beans, to a coffee maker.
      <br/>
      The charging station normally is supported by a flat horizontal surface, like a kitchen counter, and has a vertical component with a vertically adjustable portion having a plug end.
      <br/>
      The height of the plug may be vertically adjustable to accommodate wall plug outlets located at different heights above the kitchen counter.

      <br/>
      A hand held grinder 1, shown in the upright position when used, has an interior spinning blade 3 that is located in the grinding basket 4.
      <br/>
      A small electrically motor 5 fixed to the side wall of the grinder is operatively associated and connected to the blade to causes the blade to spin when electrical power is supplied.
      <br/>
      The opened grinder housing bottom 7 is adjacent the induction probe opening 13 and the recharging unit 14 and the battery pack 15.
      <br/>
      The wall opening 13 is located near the base or bottom 7 and is adapted to permit an internal probe (not shown in this figure, see FIG. 2) from a charging station to enter the grinder body from the side and induce current in the unit 14.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      At the top of the grinder 1 is a removable lid 9 shown with its front wall in place.
      <br/>
      The lid 9 is mounted on the main grinder body 11 whose front wall is removed in this view.
      <br/>
      Coffee beans or other food products, like spices, that are to be ground by the spinning blade 3 are inserted into the hollow confines of the grinder by removing the lid 9.
      <br/>
      A small safety tab 16 at the interface between the lid and main body 11 may be used to permit easy removal of the lid and to actuate a safety switch 17.
      <br/>
      The safety tab 16 must engage the safety switch 17 to complete the electrical circuit from the power button switch 18 (located on the back wall of body 11 and extending into the grinder's interior) to the electrically operated motor 5.
      <br/>
      By removing the upper lid 9, coffee beans or other food products to be ground can be inserted into the grinding basket 4 that houses the spinning grinder blade 3.
      <br/>
      The coffee beans or food products contact the blade 3 and are ground into a powder.
      <br/>
      After grinding to the desired consistency, the grinder can then be turned upside down and their ground processed products will fall into the hollow lid 9.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      At the lower end of the main housing 11 is the base 7 which has electric induction type charging opening 13, shown on the housing's back wall.
      <br/>
      The opening 13 is connected to the recharging system 14 and also to the its own rechargeable battery back 15 by wires.
      <br/>
      The battery pack is electrically connected by wires to the electric motor 5.
      <br/>
      Normally, the motor 5 is powered by the battery pack 15 which is capable of being continuously charged by the charging unit 14.
      <br/>
      There is no direct physical contact between the motor and an induced external power source (not shown in this view).
      <br/>
      Such induction charging systems are commonly found on many electronic cordless toothbrushes commercially available at this time.
      <br/>
      By using induction charging at the charging station unsightly wires that connect the grinder to the wall are eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The grinding blade 3 can be a single multifunctional can be used to grind up different food materials.
      <br/>
      Such multifunctional grinding blades are available on most food grinders commercially available today.
      <br/>
      A power button switch 18, shown mounted on the side of the body 11, is connected by wires to the motor 5 which allows the external control of the motor by a user.

    <p num="20">
      FIG. 2 is a side view showing the side opposite from that of FIG. 1 with the grinder mounted in a holster that sits on a kitchen counter 20.
      <br/>
      In this view the front wall of the grinder's lower body 11 is in place and the grinder's interior components are not visible.
      <br/>
      The grinder is the same as that shown in FIG. 1 and common visible parts bears the same numbers.
      <br/>
      The kitchen wall 19 has a conventional wall mounted alternating current plug outlet system 21 which mates with a utility plug 23 built into the charging station unit 25.
      <br/>
      The charging station unit's upper adjustable vertical component 26, which includes the utility plug end 23, is mounted on the lower portion 28 of the vertical component to permit the vertical height adjustment of the plug to accommodate wall plug outlets 21 located at different heights above the supporting kitchen counter.
      <br/>
      A telescoping mount of the two vertical components (26 and 28) may be used for this purpose with appropriate stops to fix the upper plug portion at a desired vertical level relative to the fixed counter 20 and station's base 30.
      <br/>
      Internal wires supply electrical current to the internal station charging probe 32, shown inserted into the opening 13 in the lower section of the body 11.
      <br/>
      When the probe is mounted in place properly into the lower side of the grinder, current is induced on the grinder's charging unit 14.
      <br/>
      This induces a charge in the charging unit 14 is this charge is what supplies electrical power to the grinder's batteries and motor 5 used to turn the blades 3.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      No wires would directly connect the charging opening 13 to the station charging probe unit.
      <br/>
      The only direct electrical contact to the station is between the plug 23 of the station and the conventional wall outlet 21.
      <br/>
      Using induction charging eliminates the possibility of dirty electrical contacts that engage the battery unit in the grinder's wall charging opening 13.

      In use, the user places the material to be ground in the basket 4 by first removing, inserting the material and then replacing the lid 9.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the invention, the material to be ground was less than one ounce and could be up to a total of three ounces.
      <br/>
      When in an upright position as shown, the material to be ground, like coffee beans, stays in the basket 4 and is ground by the spinning grinding blade 3.
      <br/>
      Blade 3 is actuated to spin by depressing external button 18 to supply energy to grind the beans.
      <br/>
      Once fully ground, the grinding unit 1 is turned off and placed in an upside down position from that shown in the two figures and their ground products are deposited by gravity into the holding hollow lid 9.
      <br/>
      This detachable storage lid 9 may them be detached from the body 11 of the grinder and its ground bean contents transported and used to make coffee in a coffee maker.
      <br/>
      A similar method would be used to grind and store other processed food products.
