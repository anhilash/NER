    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to an electrophotographic photosensitive member, particularly an electrophotographic photosensitive member having a surface layer comprising a specific (polyester) resin, a process cartridge including the photosensitive member, and an electrophotographic apparatus using the photosensitive member.</p>
    <p num="2">In recent years, there have been developed electrophotographic photosensitive members utilizing various organic photoconductive compounds.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Such organic photoconductive compounds have different sensitive wavelength regions depending on the compounds used.
      <br/>
      In this regard, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications (JP-A) 61-272754 and 56-167759 disclose azo pigments showing a high (photo-)sensitivity in a visible (wavelength) region.
      <br/>
      Further, JP-A 57-19576 and JP-A 61-228453 disclose compounds showing a sensitive wavelength region extending in an infrared (wavelength) region.
      <br/>
      Of these compounds (pigments), those showing a sensitivity also in the infrared region are suitable for use in laser beam printers and LED (light-emitting diode) printers and have more frequently been employed in recent years.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The photosensitive member is generally required to have good characteristics in terms of sensitivity, electrical characteristics, mechanical characteristics and optical characteristics.
      <br/>
      Particularly, when the photosensitive member is repetitively used, electrical and mechanical external forces are directly exerted on a surface layer of the photosensitive member during a sequence of, e.g., charging-exposure-developing-transfer-cleaning in an ordinary electrophotographic process.
      <br/>
      As a result, the surface layer of the photosensitive member is required to have durabilities against such external forces, such as a durability against a deterioration due to ozone and nitrogen oxides generated in the charging step and a durability against electrical and mechanical deteriorations due to surface abrasion and/or mars caused by charging (discharging) and/or cleaning.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Particularly, an organic photosensitive member uses a softer organic photoconductive compound (substance) in many cases when compared with an inorganic photosensitive member, and thus is required to improve its durability against mechanical deterioration.</p>
    <p num="6">Further, in recent years, there has been mainly used, as a charging scheme, a contact (or direct) charging scheme wherein a photosensitive member is charged by applying a voltage to a charging member disposed in contact with the photosensitive member as described in JP-A 57-17826 and JP-A 58-40566.</p>
    <p num="7">The contact charging scheme has the advantages of less ozone generation and high charging efficiency when compared with the case of a corona discharge scheme using scorotron liable to cause ozone generation and inefficient charging due to a large amount of current passing through a shield (ca. 80% based on that of current to be supplied to a charger), thus resulting in a very economical and effective charging scheme.</p>
    <p num="8">
      The contact charging scheme is used in contact with a photosensitive member.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the photosensitive member is required to have a further improved mechanical strength.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Further, the use of a contact (direct) charging scheme utilizing a DC (direct-current) voltage superposed with an AC (alternating-current) voltage has been proposed in order to enhance charging stability (JP-A 63-149668).</p>
    <p num="10">However, while the contact charging scheme (as described in JP-A 63-149668) can improve charging stability, it is accompanied by a problem such that an amount of current passing through a photosensitive member is liable to be remarkably increased due to the use of the AC voltage which results in a larger amount of abrasion of the photosensitive member.</p>
    <p num="11">As described above, the electrophotographic photosensitive member is required to have not only mechanical strength but also electrical strength.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <p num="20">The sole FIGURE is a schematic sectional view of an embodiment of an electrophotographic apparatus including a process cartridge using an electrophotographic photosensitive member according to the present invention.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">In the present invention, an electrophotographic photosensitive member is characterized by a surface layer comprising a polyester resin having a structural (recurring) unit represented by the formula (1) shown hereinabove having a partial structure (--A1 --) comprising a substituted or unsubstituted divalent aliphatic hydrocarbon group.</p>
    <p num="22">Herein, the "aliphatic hydrocarbon group" means a (divalent) hydrocarbon group derived from an aliphatic compound which may have a chain (open-ring) structure and/or a cyclic (closed-ring) structure unless the compound exhibits aromaticity.</p>
    <p num="23">
      In the present invention, the polyester resin (having the structural unit of the formula (1)) constituting the surface layer of the photosensitive member has an iso- and/or terephthalic acid structure providing rigidity and an aliphatic hydrocarbon structure providing flexibility or toughness in combination as its molecular structure.
      <br/>
      Based on this combination (of rigidity and toughness), the resultant polyester resin is considered to be remarkably improved in mechanical strength.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The polyester resin is also effective in preventing an electrical deterioration.</p>
    <p num="25">The reason therefor has not been clarified as yet but may be attributable to a structure which is considerably resistant to oxidation considered to be one of factors causing the electrical deterioration of the photosensitive member.</p>
    <p num="26">
      In the present invention, in view of compatibility (mutual solubility) with a charge-transporting material, the divalent aliphatic hydrocarbon group (A1 in the formula (1)) constituting the polyester resin may preferably be a divalent group represented by the following formula (2):
      <br/>
      --R1 --A2 --R2 --  (2),
    </p>
    <p num="27">wherein R1 and R2 independently denote a substituted or unsubstituted alkylene group and A2 denotes a substituted or unsubstituted alicyclic hydrocarbon group.</p>

    <p num="31">The polyester resin constituting the surface layer of the photosensitive member according to the present invention may preferably have a structural unit of the following formula (3):  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="32">wherein R3, R4 and Rn independently denote hydrogen, halogen or an alkyl group; and n is 1, 2 or 3.</p>
    <p num="33">In the above formula (3), examples of halogen for R3, R4 and Rn may include fluorine, chlorine and bromine and examples of alkyl group may include methyl, ethyl and propyl.</p>

    <p num="44">
      In the present invention, the polyester resin may have another structural unit in addition to the structural unit of the formula (1) described above within a range providing a desired effect of the present invention.

    <p num="53">After the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled and dissolved in 3 liters of chloroform, followed by re-precipitation from methanol.</p>
    <p num="54">The precipitate was recovered by filtration and dried to obtain a colorless polymer corresponding to Resin No. 4 (consisting of the structural unit (1) and the structural unit (7)) appearing in Examples described hereinafter (Mw=32,000, Yield=74%).</p>
    <p num="55">Other polyester resins used in the present invention (e.g., those having at least one species of the structural units (1)-(11)) may be produced in a similar manner as in Synthesis Example by appropriately changing materials and proportions of the dicarboxylic acid component and the dihydroxy alcohol component.</p>
    <p num="56">In the photosensitive member according to the present invention, the surface layer may be a part of or all of a photosensitive layer formed on a substrate or a protective layer formed on the photosensitive layer.</p>
    <p num="57">When the photosensitive layer is a single layer containing a charge-generating material and a charge transporting material at the same time, the single layer-type photosensitive layer corresponds to the surface layer.</p>
    <p num="58">When the photosensitive layer comprises a lower layer (comprising a charge generation layer containing a charge-generating material or a charge transport layer containing a charge-transporting material) disposed on a support and an upper layer (comprising the charge transport layer or the charge generation layer) disposed on the lower layer, the upper layer (i.e., the charge transport layer or the charge generation layer) corresponds to the surface layer.</p>
    <p num="59">In the present invention, the charge transport layer (as the upper layer) may preferably be the surface layer in view of electrophotographic characteristics.</p>
    <p num="60">
      The charge transport layer may be formed by applying (wet-coating) a solution of a binder resin and the charge-transporting material in an appropriate solvent and drying the resultant wet coating.
      <br/>
      Examples of the charge-transporting material may include a triarylamine compound, a hydrazone compound, a stilbene compound, a pyrazoline compound, an oxazole compound, a triarylmethane compound and a thiazole compound.
      <br/>
      The binder resin comprises the above-mentioned polyester resin in the case where the charge transport layer is the surface layer or comprises various resins (other than the polyester resin) in the case where the charge transport layer is not the surface layer.
      <br/>
      The charge-transporting material and the binder resin may preferably be mixed in a weight ratio of 1:0.5 to 1:2. The thus formed charge transport layer may preferably have a thickness of 5-40  MU m, more preferably 15-30  MU m.

      The charge generation layer may be formed by applying a dispersion prepared by well dispersing a mixture of the charge-generating material, a binder resin (in an amount (by weight) 0.3-4 times that of the charge-generating material) in a dispersion means (such as, a homogenizer, an ultrasonic dispersion mill, a ball mill, a vibration ball mill, a sand mill, an attritor, a roll mill, and a high-speed dispersion machine of a liquid impingement-type and drying the resultant wet coating.

      <br/>
      The binder resin comprises the above-mentioned polyester resin in the case where the charge transport layer is the surface layer or comprises various resins (other than the polyester resin) in the case where the charge transport layer is not the surface layer.
      <br/>
      The thus formed charge generation layer may preferably have a thickness of at most 5  MU m, more preferably 0.1-2  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The single layer-type photosensitive layer may be formed by applying a coating liquid prepared by dispersing or dissolving the above-mentioned charge-generating and charge-transporting material in the above-mentioned binder resins and drying the resultant wet coating.
      <br/>
      The thus formed photosensitive layer may preferably have a thickness of 5-40  MU m, more preferably 15-30  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      When the protective layer is disposed on the photosensitive layer, the protective layer may be formed by applying a solution of the polyester resin and an optional additive such as an organic or inorganic resistivity-controlling agent, as desired in an appropriate solvent and drying the resultant wet coating.
      <br/>
      The thus formed protective layer may preferably have a thickness of 0.5-10  MU m, more preferably 1-5  MU m.

    <p num="64">
      The support of the photosensitive member may comprise any electroconductive material and may be formed in a sheet shape or a cylindrical shape.
      <br/>
      Examples of the electroconductive material may include metals such as aluminum and stainless steel; and metals, paper and plastics each provided with an electroconductive layer.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      In the present invention, between the support and the photosensitive layer, it is possible to dispose an electroconductive layer for the purpose of prevention of interference fringes and coating for mars on the support.
      <br/>
      Such an electroconductive layer may be formed by applying a dispersion of electroconductive particles such as carbon black, metal particles and metal oxide particles in an appropriate binder resin and drying the resultant wet coating.
      <br/>
      The thus formed electroconductive layer may preferably have a thickness of 5-40  MU m, particularly 10-30  MU m.

      Further, in the present invention, an intermediate layer having an adhesion function and a barrier function may be disposed between the support and the photosensitive layer or between the electroconductive layer and the photosensitive layer, as desired.
      <br/>
      Examples of a material for the intermediate layer may include polyamide, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene oxide, ethyl cellulose, casein, polyurethane and polyether-urethane.
      <br/>
      These materials may be applied in a solution in an appropriate solvent.
      <br/>
      The thus formed intermediate layer may preferably have a thickness of 0.05-5  MU m, particularly 0.3-1  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="67">The electrophotographic photosensitive member according to the present invention can be applied to not only an ordinary electrophotographic copying machine but also a laser beam printer, a light-emitting diode (LED) printer, a cathode-ray tube (CRT) printer, a liquid crystal printer, and other fields of applied electrophotography including, e.g., laser plate making.</p>
    <p num="68">Hereinbelow, an embodiment of an electrophotographic apparatus including a process cartridge using the photosensitive member according to the present invention will be explained with reference to the sole FIGURE.</p>
    <p num="69">
      The FIGURE shows a schematic structural view of such an electrophotographic apparatus of the invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to the FIGURE, a photosensitive drum (i.e., photosensitive member) 1 according to the present invention is rotated about an axis 2 at a prescribed peripheral (process) speed in the direction of an arrow shown inside of the photosensitive drum 1.
      <br/>
      The surface of the photosensitive drum 1 is uniformly charged by using a primary charging means (charger) 3 (contact charging means in the FIGURE) to have a prescribed positive or negative potential during the rotation.
      <br/>
      The photosensitive drum 1 is (image-) exposed to light 4 (as by slit exposure or laser beam-scanning exposure) by using an exposure means (not shown) in a step of (image-) exposure, whereby an electrostatic latent image corresponding to an exposure image is successively formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum 1.
      <br/>
      The thus formed electrostatic latent image is developed by a developing means 5 to form a toner image in a step of developing.
      <br/>
      The developed toner image is successively transferred to a transfer(-receiving) material 7 which is supplied from a supply part (not shown) to a position between the photosensitive drum 1 and a transfer means (charger) 6 in synchronism with the rotation of the photosensitive drum 1, by means of the transfer means 6.
      <br/>
      The transfer material 7 with the transferred toner image thereon is separated from the photosensitive drum 1 to be conveyed to an image-fixing means 8, followed by image fixing to print out the transfer material 7 as a copy outside the electrophotographic apparatus.
      <br/>
      Residual toner particles on the surface of the photosensitive drum 1 after the transfer are removed by a cleaning means (cleaner) 9 to provide a cleaned surface, and residual charge on the surface of the photosensitive drum 1 is erased by pre-exposure light 10 emitted from a pre-exposure means (not shown) to prepare for the next cycle.
      <br/>
      As shown in the FIGURE, when the primary charging means 3 is a contact charging means using a charging roller etc., the pre-exposure step may be omitted as desired.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      In the electrophotographic apparatus, it is possible to provide a process cartridge which includes plural means inclusive of or selected from the photosensitive member (photosensitive drum) 1, the primary charging means 3, the developing means 5, the cleaning means 9, etc. so as to be detachably mountable to a main body of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      The process cartridge may, for example, be composed of the photosensitive member 1 and at least one means selected from the group consisting of the primary charging means 3, the developing means 5 and the cleaning means 9 to prepare a single unit capable of being attached to or detached from the main body of the electrophotographic apparatus by using a guiding means such as rails 12 in the apparatus body.
    </p>
    <p num="71">In the case where the electrophotographic apparatus is used as a copying machine or a printer, (image-)exposure light 4 may be provided by reading a data on reflection light or transmitted light from an original or by reading a data on the original by means of a sensor, converting the data into a signal and then effecting a laser beam scanning, a drive of LED array or a drive of a liquid crystal shutter array so as to expose the photosensitive member surface to the light 4 depending on the signal.</p>

    <p num="79">A coating liquid for a charge transport layer was prepared by dissolving a mixture of 10 parts of a polyester resin (Resin No. 1 shown in Table 1 appearing hereinafter) prepared similarly as in Synthesis Example 1 and 8 parts of a triarylamine compound of the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '8' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="80">in a mixture solvent of 50 parts of monochlorobenzene and 50 parts of dichloromethane.</p>
    <p num="81">The thus prepared coating liquid was applied onto the charge generation layer by dipping, followed by drying for 1 hour at 120 (degree)  C. to form a 25  MU m-thick charge transport (surface) layer, thus preparing an electrophotographic photosensitive member.</p>
    <p num="82">
      The thus prepared photosensitive member was installed in a remodeled machine of a laser beam printer ("Laser Jet 4 Plus", mfd. by Hewlett-Packard Company) equipped with a contact charging means as a primary charger.
      <br/>
      The laser beam printer was remodeled so that a peak-to-peak voltage of an AC voltage applied at the time of the primary charging was increased to 125% of that in an original state and a potentiometer was connected so as to be suitable for measurement of electrophotographic characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="83">The measurement of the electrophotographic characteristics was performed in an environment of 23 (degree)  C. and 50% RH (normal temperature--normal humidity environment) in terms of a dark-part potential Vd (volt) and a sensitivity  DELTA 500 ( MU J/cm2).</p>
    <p num="84">A larger value (absolute value) of the dark-part potential represents a better chargeability.</p>
    <p num="85">The sensitivity  DELTA 500 was evaluated as a light energy required for decreasing a surface potential from -700 volts to -200 volts per unit area.</p>
    <p num="86">A lower value of the sensitivity  DELTA 500 represents a better sensitivity.</p>
    <p num="87">The photosensitive member installed in the laser beam printer was then subjected to a successive image formation test on 7000 sheets in an intermittent mode in the normal temperature-normal humidity environment to evaluate an image quality and an abrasion degree of the photosensitive member surface.</p>
    <p num="88">The image formation test was performed with respect to a character image pattern on an A4-sized sheet (image area=5%).</p>
    <p num="89">After the image formation test, the abrasion degree was measured by means of an eddy-current thickness meter ("Permascope Type 111", mfd. by Fisher Co.).</p>
    <p num="90">Further, the image quality was evaluated as an occurrence of fogs on the prescribed sheets by eye observation.</p>
