    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">The present invention relates to computer systems and more particularly to computer systems for mining information about gene expression levels.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Devices and computer systems have been developed for collecting information about gene expression or expressed sequence tags (EST) in large numbers of samples.
      <br/>
      For example, PCT application WO92/10588, incorporated herein by reference for all purposes, describes techniques for sequence checking nucleic acids and other materials.
      <br/>
      Probes for performing these operations may be formed in arrays according to the pioneering techniques disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,639, for example.
      <br/>
      Both of these U.S. Patents are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      According to one aspect of the techniques described in these patents, an array of nucleic acid probes is fabricated at known locations on a chip or substrate.
      <br/>
      A fluorescent label attached to a nucleic acid is then brought into contact with the chip and a scanner generates an image file indicating the locations where the labeled nucleic acids bound to the chip.
      <br/>
      Based upon the identities of the probes at these locations, information such as the monomer sequence of DNA or RNA can be extracted.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Computer-aided techniques for gene expression monitoring using such arrays of probes have been developed as disclosed in EP Pub.
      <br/>
      No. 0848067 and PCT publication No. WO 97/10365, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      Many diseases are characterized by differences in the degree that various genes are expressed either through changes in the copy number of the genetic DNA or through changes in levels of transcription (e.g., through control of initiation, provision of RNA precursors, RNA processing, etc.) of particular genes.
      <br/>
      For example, losses and gains of genetic material play an important role in malignant transformation and progression.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, changes in the expression (transcription) levels of particular genes (e.g., oncogenes or tumor suppressors), serve as signposts for the presence and progression of various cancers.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Information on expression of genes or expressed sequence tags may be collected on a large scale in many ways, including the probe array techniques described above.
      <br/>
      One of the objectives in collecting this information is the identification of genes or ESTs whose expression is of particular importance.
      <br/>
      Researchers use such techniques to answer questions such as: 1) Which genes are expressed in cells of a malignant tumor but not expressed in either healthy tissue or tissue treated according to a particular regime? 2) Which genes or ESTs are expressed in particular organs but not in others? 3) Which genes or ESTs are expressed in particular species but not in others?
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Collecting vast amounts of expression data from large numbers of samples including many tissue types is useful in answering these questions.
      <br/>
      However, in order to derive full benefit from the investment made in collecting and storing expression data, techniques enabling one to efficiently mine the data to find items of particular relevance are highly desirable.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The present invention provides techniques for organizing expression or concentration information in a way that facilitates mining.
      <br/>
      A database model is provided which may organize information relating to, e.g., sample preparation, expression analysis of experiment results, and intermediate and final results of mining gene expression measurements, gene sets and the like.
      <br/>
      The model is readily translatable into database languages such as SQL and the like.
      <br/>
      The database model can scale to permit mining of gene expression measurements collected from large numbers of samples.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      According to an embodiment of the present invention, a computer based method for mining a plurality of experiment information is provided.
      <br/>
      The method includes a variety of steps such as collecting information from experiments and chip designs.
      <br/>
      The method can include steps of selecting experiments to be mined.
      <br/>
      Experiment results and other information can be organized by experimental analysis, and the like.
      <br/>
      A step of defining one or more groupings for the experiments to be mined is also be part of the method.
      <br/>
      The method also includes a step of selecting based upon the groupings, information about the experiments to be mined to form a plurality of resulting information.
      <br/>
      This resulting information can include one or more resulting gene sets, and the like.
      <br/>
      Finally, the method formats the resulting information for viewing by a user.
      <br/>
      The combination of these steps can provide to the user the ability to access experiment information.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In some embodiments, visualization techniques can be used in conjunction with the steps of the method to enable users to more easily understand the results of the data mining.
      <br/>
      Further, in some embodiments, a step of recording conclusions about the results of the data mining can also be part of the method.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In another aspect according to the present invention, a method for working with expression information is provided.
      <br/>
      The method includes a variety of steps such as collecting information about results of experiments.
      <br/>
      A step of gathering information about samples and information about the experiments, which can comprise an experimental analysis and the like, is also part of the method.
      <br/>
      The step of adding one or more attributes to the information about the experiments can also be performed.
      <br/>
      The method then transforms the plurality of results of experiments into a plurality of transformed information.
      <br/>
      Transformations can include normalizing, de-normalizing, aggregation, scaling, and the like.
      <br/>
      Steps of mining the plurality of transformed information and visualizing the plurality of transformed information can also be part of the method.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Numerous benefits are achieved by way of the present invention over conventional techniques.
      <br/>
      Some embodiments according to the present invention can provide better access to genetic experiment information than methods known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      Embodiments can provide answers to queries such as, "show all genes where the gene expression value is greater than or equal to 100, where at least three genes out of four respond to the query," as well as answers to many other and varied useful queries.
      <br/>
      Another advantage provided by this approach is that the results of numerous experiments can be mined effectively using visualization techniques and set theory queries.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="17">
      One embodiment of the present invention operates in the context of a system for analyzing biological or other materials using arrays that themselves include probes that may be made of biological materials such as RNA or DNA.
      <br/>
      The VLSIPS (tm)  and GeneChip (tm)  technologies provide methods of making and using very large arrays of polymers, such as nucleic acids, on very small chips.
      <br/>
      Reference may be had to U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854 and PCT Patent Publication Nos.
      <br/>
      WO 90/15070 and 92/10092, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.
      <br/>
      Nucleic acid probes on the chip are used to detect complementary nucleic acid sequences in a sample nucleic acid of interest (the "target" nucleic acid).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      It should be understood that the probes need not be nucleic acid probes but may also be other polymers such as peptides.
      <br/>
      Peptide probes may be used to detect the concentration of peptides, polypeptides, or polymers in a sample.
      <br/>
      The probes should be carefully selected to have bonding affinity to the compound whose concentration they are to be used to measure.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 1 illustrates a simplified diagram of a representative example system 100 for forming and analyzing arrays of biological materials such as RNA or DNA.
      <br/>
      This diagram is merely an illustration and should not limit the scope of the claims herein.
      <br/>
      One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
      <br/>
      A chip design system 104 is used to design arrays of polymers such as biological polymers such as RNA or DNA.
      <br/>
      Chip design system 104 may be, for example, an appropriately programmed Sun Workstation or personal computer or workstation, such as an IBM PC equivalent, and the like.
      <br/>
      Chip design system 104 obtains inputs from a user regarding chip design objectives including characteristics of genes of interest, and other inputs regarding the desired features of the array.
      <br/>
      Optionally, chip design system 104 may obtain information regarding a specific genetic sequence of interest from bioinformatics database 102 or from external databases such as GenBank.
      <br/>
      The output of chip design system 104 is a set of chip design computer files in the form of, for example, a switch matrix, as described in PCT application WO 92/10092, and other associated computer files.
      <br/>
      Systems for designing chips for sequencing, sequence checking and expression analysis are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,639 and in PCT application WO 97/10365, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The chip design files are input to a mask design system (not shown) that designs the lithographic masks used in the fabrication of arrays of molecules such as DNA.
      <br/>
      The mask design system designs the lithographic masks used in the fabrication of probe arrays.
      <br/>
      The mask design system generates mask design files that are then used by a mask construction system (not shown) to construct masks or other synthesis patterns such as chrome-on-glass masks for use in the fabrication of polymer arrays.

      A biological source 112 is, for example, tissue from a plant or animal.
      <br/>
      Various processing steps are applied to material from biological source 112 by a sample preparation system 114.
      <br/>
      These steps may include isolation of mRNA, precipitation of the mRNA to increase concentration.

      The result of the various processing steps is a target sample ready for application to the chips produced by the synthesis system 110.

      The prepared samples include monomer nucleotide sequences such as RNA or DNA.
      <br/>
      When the sample is applied to the chip by a sample exposure system 116, the nucleotides may or may not bond to the probes.
      <br/>
      The nucleotides have been tagged with fluorescein labels to determine which probes have bonded to nucleotide sequences from the sample.
      <br/>
      The prepared samples will be placed in a scanning system 118.

      Scanning system 118 includes a detection device such as a confocal microscope or CCD (charge-coupled device) that is used to detect the location where labeled receptors have bound to the substrate.

      The output of scanning system 118 is an image file(s) indicating, in the case of fluorescein labeled receptor, the fluorescence intensity (photon counts or other related measurements, such as voltage) as a function of position on the substrate.
      <br/>
      Since higher photon counts will be observed where the labeled receptor has bound more strongly to the array of polymers, and since the monomer sequence of the polymers on the substrate is known as a function of position, it becomes possible to determine the sequence(s) of polymer(s) on the substrate that are complementary to the receptor.

      Representative table 302 includes one or more records where each record includes fields corresponding to the listed attributes.
      <br/>
      The contents of the key fields taken together identify an individual record.
      <br/>
      In the ERD, each table is represented by a rectangle divided by a horizontal line.

      In operation, expression mining database 124 is updated during mining operations.

      Certain tables are updated by importation and transformation from expression analysis database 122.

      Certain other tables may be updated as an operator of querying and mining system 126 defines a query operation.

    <p num="36">
      It can be useful to identify genes or ESTs whose expression varies in some way depending on one or more tissue attributes.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is necessary for querying and mining system 126 to have awareness of tissue attributes associated with expression analysis results.
      <br/>
      One or more analysis results are typically associated with what is herein referred to as "leaf target samples."
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In order to provide a more easily understood explanation of the workings of the present invention, the relationship between "leaf target samples" and tissue attributes will first be discussed.
      <br/>
      A "raw sample" represents a piece of extracted tissue.
      <br/>
      Before further processing, a single raw sample may be cleaved into multiple raw samples.
      <br/>
      The raw samples are the input to sample preparation system 114.
      <br/>
      For each raw sample, sample preparation system 114 prepares a so-called "target" which is a fluid including mRNA or other expression indicator.
      <br/>
      A "target" may be split into multiple "replicates" and replicates may be pooled to form another target.
      <br/>
      The individual "targets" that are applied to chips are the leaf target samples.
      <br/>
      Each application of a "leaf target sample" to a chip represents an experiment.
      <br/>
      In a presently preferable embodiment, expression analyses can be conducted on experiment data according to one or more selectable criteria to produce experimental analysis result data.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The tables of expression mining database 124 that relate to samples and attributes are identified in FIG. 4A by the letter "A." Leaf target samples, raw samples, replicates, targets, etc. are listed in a sample item table 402.
      <br/>
      A sample item derivation table 404 lists transformations from one sample item to another.
      <br/>
      Sample item derivation table lists, e.g., splitting, pooling, and cleaving operations, transformations from raw samples to targets and analyses applied.
      <br/>
      A sample derivation type table 406 lists the various types of transformation.
      <br/>
      The various sample item types themselves, e.g., target, replicate, raw sample, leaf target sample, analyses and the like, are listed in a sample item type table 408.
      <br/>
      Listing the sample derivation types and sample item types allows easy reprogramming to accommodate changes in sample processing procedures.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Associated with samples are attributes.
      <br/>
      Some of the attributes are strings or values identifying concentrations, sample preparation dates, expiration dates, and the like.
      <br/>
      Other attributes identify characteristics that are highly useful in searching for genes or ESTs of interest such as the disease state of tissue, the organ, or species from which a sample is extracted.
      <br/>
      Attributes are listed in a sample item attribute table 410.
      <br/>
      A sample item attribute map table 412 implements a many-to-many relationship between sample item attribute table 410 and a sample item table 402.
      <br/>
      A sample may have more than one attribute, and an attribute can describe more than one sample item.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Each attribute has an associated attribute type listed in a sample item attribute type table 414 and an associated value for the attribute.
      <br/>
      Examples of attribute types are "concentration," "preparation date," "expiration date," etc.
      <br/>
      Another example of an attribute type would be "specimen type" where possible values would correspond to "tissue," "organ culture," "purified cells," "primary cell culture," "established cell line," and the like.
      <br/>
      Another example might be "ethnic group" where different values may correspond to "East Asian," Native American," for example.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Many attribute types may be understood to derived from other attribute types.
      <br/>
      For example, the attribute type "ethnic group" may derived from an attribute type "human" which is in turn derived from an attribute "species." Some attribute types have no associated attributes but rather define levels of categorization.
      <br/>
      The derivations relating a "parent" attribute type to a "child" attribute type are listed in an attribute type derivation type table 418.
      <br/>
      Any attribute type may have one or more parents or children.
      <br/>
      Different types of derivation are listed in an attribute type derivation type table 420.
      <br/>
      One representative attribute type derivation type is category-subcategory where the parent type represents a category and the child type represents the subcategory.
      <br/>
      The availability of derivation relationships among attribute types greatly facilitate the formulation of useful queries to expression mining database 124, allowing the user to readily identify attribute types of interest.
