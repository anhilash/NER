      A power supply line is wired in a loop from a battery power supply, and a power supply relay circuit is installed intermediately of the power supply line such that power is supplied from the power supply relay circuit to an electric load connected to a terminal unit of an intensive wiring line.
      <br/>
      By this arrangement, not only wires for control signals but also wires for power supply can be reduced.
      <br/>
      The terminal unit may serve also as the power supply relay circuit.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to a power supplying apparatus and method for a plurality of electric loads remote from a power supply, and also to a semiconductor circuit apparatus and an intensive wiring apparatus for transmission of control information for supplying power to use with the power supplying apparatus and method.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In a conventional power supplying apparatus for a vehicle, a power supply carried on the vehicle and each of several electric loads are connected to each other by a long power supply line with a fuse interposed therein.
      <br/>
      When a power supply line is short-circuited, the fuse is blown to disconnect the electric load from the power supply.
    </p>
    <p num="3">In control of electric loads of a conventional vehicle, a so-called multiplexing wiring system is known wherein controllers for individually controlling a plurality of electric loads are integrated into a smaller number of controllers having a communication function and a calculation function so that control signals for the electric loads are calculated by the smaller number of controllers and the control signals are transmitted to terminal equipment connected by communication lines to control several electric loads connected to each of the terminal equipment (refer to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,771,382, 5,113,410, 4,855,896 and 5,438,506).</p>
    <p num="4">
      However, power supply lines are usually wired from a power supply directly to individual electric loads or to driving circuits for the electric loads, and the number of power supply lines is equal to or larger than the number of electric loads.
      <br/>
      Thus, and the floor or the inside of the body of a vehicle is full of wiring lines.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Accordingly, basically it is a principle object of the present invention to provide a novel power supplying apparatus for a vehicle.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it is an object of the present invention to reduce power supply lines of a power supplying apparatus for a vehicle.
      <br/>
      It is another object of the present invention to eliminate a fuse.
      <br/>
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide a novel power supplying method.
      <br/>
      It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a novel semiconductor circuit apparatus for use for in supplying power.
      <br/>
      It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide a novel intensive wiring apparatus integrated with a power supply control system.
      <br/>
      It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide a novel power supplying apparatus for a particular electric load of an automobile.
      <br/>
      It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide a novel apparatus for detecting short-circuits in a power supply line.
      <br/>
      The objects recited above are solved by different solutions disclosed hereinbelow or in the appended claims.
    </p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">According to a first aspect of the present invention, since two power supply lines are led out from one of the poles of a power supply such that power can be supplied from both power supply lines to electric loads, a novel power supplying apparatus wherein, even if one of the lines is short-circuited, supply of power can be maintained from the other line can be provided.</p>
    <p num="7">According to another aspect of the present invention, since an electric switching apparatus for controlling the connection and disconnection between a power supply line and an electric load is provided in a relay circuit arranged between the power supply line and the electric line such that, when the power supply line is short-circuited, the switching apparatus is operated to disconnect the electric load from the circuit, a fuse can be eliminated.</p>
    <p num="8">According to a further aspect of the present invention, since power transmission lines of a closed loop are formed from power supply lines connected to one of two poles of a power supply such that power can be supplied from the opposite sides of a connection point of an electric load so that, even if short-circuiting or disconnection occurs with one of the transmission lines, supply of power can be continued from the other side of the transmission line, the number of electric loads which are rendered uncontrollable by a failure of a transmission line can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="9">According to a still further aspect of the present invention, since a network is formed from power supply lines similar to communication lines to construct a multiplexing wiring system which can handle both control signals and power, the power supply lines are also aggregated and the number of electric wires can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="10">According to a yet further aspect of the present invention, since power supplying apparatus for electric loads for an air conditioner control unit, a power train control unit, a lamp control unit, a navigation unit, an anti-lock braking control unit, a window opening and closing motor control unit, a display circuit control unit for an instrument panel, a rear defogger controlling unit, a beacon control unit and so forth, are formed from a novel power supplying apparatus of the present invention, those electric loads in an automobile can be controlled with a reduced number of wiring lines.</p>

      FIG. 1 is a view of an entire system for an automobile to which the present invention is applied, and FIG. 2 is a functional block diagram of the system.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 3 denotes a battery which supplies power to the entire vehicle via a fusible link 4.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 10 denotes a power train control module (PCM) which effects control of the fuel injection amount or the ignition timing of an engine and control of an engine transmission and is mounted in the proximity of the engine (for example, on an outer wall of an intake manifold, in the inside of a surge tank or the like) around which sensors and/or actuators are provided for controlling the engine which is an object of control.
      <br/>
      A set of actuators as electric loads, such as several sensors, for example, an air flow meter and a water temperature sensor, injectors 9 and a fan motor 35 for cooling the engine are connected to the PCM 10.
      <br/>

      Reference numeral 14 denotes a body control module (BCM), to which devices and/or key switches in the proximity of a steering wheel are connected and which is installed in the proximity of the dashboard.
      <br/>
      Each of the modules at least has an arithmetic processing unit (cpu) communication means (communication IC) for communicating data with the other modules.
      <br/>
      Each module is installed in the proximity of a sensor or a device such as an electric load connected to the module so that the harness length between the module and each of the devices connected to the module may be minimized.
      <br/>
      A front integrated module (FIM) 5 is disposed at front locations of the engine compartment adjacent headlamps 1 and 6 or turn signal lamps 2a, 2b, 7a and 7b and is connected so as to drive the headlamps 1 and 6, the turn signal lamps 2a, 2b, 7a and 7b, a horn 8 and so forth mounted in the proximity.
      <br/>
      An instrument panel module (IPM) 17 is a module mounted in an instrument panel meter case and drives lamps and meters in the instrument panel.
      <br/>
      A driver door module (DDM) 18, a passenger door module (PDM) 20, a rear right door module (RRDM) 27 and a rear left door module (RLDM) 22 are carried on doors on the driver's seat side, the passenger's seat side, the right side of the rear seat and the left side of the rear seat, respectively, and door lock motors 19 and 21, power window (19a, 20a) motors 73 and 106, door lock switches 74 and 105, power window switches 75 and 104, motors (not shown) for electrically driven mirrors 19b and 20b and so forth are connected to them.
      <br/>
      A driver seat module (DSM) 26 and a passenger seat module (PSM) 24 are mounted underneath the seats on the driver's seat side and the passenger's seat side, respectively, and electrically driven seat motors 111 to 113 and 123 to 125, seat switches 114 and 122 and so forth are connected to them.
      <br/>
      A rear integrated module (RIM) 29 is disposed at a front portion of the trunk compartment adjacent tail lamps 32 and 33 and turn signal lamps 31 and 34 and is connected to drive, in addition to the tail lamps 32 and 33 and the turn signal lamps 31 and 34, a trunk opener motor 133, a rear defogger 134 and so forth.
      <br/>
      The FIM 5, RIM 29, IPM 17, DDM 18, PDM 20, RRDM 27, RLDM 22, DSM 26 and PSM 24 have communication means 52, 131, 84, 70, 102, 77, 136, 120 and 109 to communicate data between different modules, and input/output interfaces 51, 132, 85, 71, 103, 78, 137, 121 and 110 to which sensors, switches and external electric loads are connected, but, in the present embodiment, do not have an arithmetic processing unit (CPU). (Naturally, they may have an arithmetic processing unit (CPU)).
      <br/>
      As multiplexed communication lines along which data are communicated between different modules, a line 12 is connected to extend from the FIM 5 to the BCM 14, and a line 36 is connected to extend from the BCM 14 to the RIM 29 while a line 39 is connected to extend from the RIM 29 to the FIM 5, and the multiplex communication lines are wired in a loop in the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The other modules, that is, the IPM 17, DDM 18, PDM 20, RRDM 28, RLDM 22, DSM 26, PSM 24, PCM 10, ABS 11, A/C 16, navigation control module 15 and SDM 25 are connected individually, branching from locations near the lines 12, 36 and line 39 arranged in the loop.
      <br/>
      In this manner, since each module is disposed in the proximity of a device connected to the module and input data and output data of any device which is not connected to the module are transmitted or received via the multiplexed communication lines, the necessity for connection of the module to a device located remotely by a wire in order to acquire data necessary for the module is eliminated, and consequently, wiring lines for signal transmission, that is, harnesses, can be reduced.
      <br/>
      A power supply line from the battery 3 is connected to the FIM 5 by a power supply line 40 via the fusible link 4, and connected by a power supply line 13 between the FIM 5 and the BCM 10, by another power supply line 37 between the BCM 10 and the RIM 29 and by a further power supply line 38 between the RIM 29 and the FIM 5, and is disposed in a loop in the vehicle compled with the multiplexed communication lines 12, 36 and 39.
      <br/>
      The IPM 17, DDM 18, PDM 20, RRDM 27, RLDM 22, DSM 26 and PSM 24 which are modules which must operate irrespective of an ON or OFF position of an ignition key switch 67 are connected branching from locations the power supply lines 13, 37 and 38 arranged in a loop so that electric power may be supplied to them.
      <br/>
      From near the FIM 5, power is supplied via a power supply line 41 to the modules, actuators and so forth of the PCM 10 and the ABS 11 mounted in the engine room.
      <br/>
      From the BCM 10, power is supplied to the A/C 16, navigation control module 15, SDM 25 and actuators and sensors mounted in the compartment by power supply lines 42 and 43.
      <br/>
      Further, from the RIM 29, power is supplied to the beacon 30 and actuators and sensors mounted in the trunk compartment by a power supply line 44.
      <br/>
      Since the power supply lines are wired in a loop in the vehicle and the modules to which power is inputted from the power supply lines wired in a loop and which supplies the power to the different modules, actuators, sensors and so forth are disposed one by one in the engine compartment, the passenger compartment and the trunk compartment (since, in the present embodiment, they are formed from the FIM, BCM and RIM, respectively), such a situation that power supply lines are wired in multiples in the vehicle is eliminated, and wire harnesses in the vehicle can be further reduced.

      The I/O interfaces 55, 58, 96, 118 and 129 are connected to actuators such as fuel supplying injectors of the engine, driving solenoids for hydraulic valves for the ABS and the blower motor mounted in the proximities of them such that they drive them in accordance with calculation results of the respective CPUs and transmit input signals thereto to the CPUs 56, 59, 90, 94, 116 and 127.
      <br/>
      The I/O communication ICs built in the FIM 5, RIM 29, DDM 18, PDM 20, RRDM 27, RLDM 22, IPM 17, DSM 26 and PSM 24 have respective unique physical addresses and are each constructed such that it fetches, when an address signal same as the physical address of the I/O communication IC appears on the communication lines, a signal following the address signal, outputs the signal to the I/O interface, then outputs input data from an electric load connected to the I/O interface to the communication lines, and, if a change appears in the electric load connected to the I/O interface, then transmits a function address representing contents that "input data from an electric load to the I/O interface are transmitted" first and then outputs input data of the I/O interface to the communication line.
      <br/>
      Since the communication function is restricted in manner, a module construction which does not require a CPU can be used.
      <br/>
      A module having this I/O communication IC is generally referred to as an LCU (Local Control Unit).
      <br/>
      The communication ICs built in the BCM 14, PCM 10, ABS 11, navigation control module 15, A/C 16, SDM 25 and beacon 30 are constructed so that control of transmission and reception is performed by a CPU.
      <br/>
      In particular, also the timing at which transmission is to be started and the transmission data are controlled by a signal from the CPU, and not only reception according to the physical address peculiar to the CPU but also a function address can be discriminated by the CPU to fetch or ignore data following the function address.
      <br/>
      In the following, operation is described with reference to FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      As an example, a case wherein the P/W raising switch on the passenger's seat side mounted on the door on the driver's seat side is depressed to raise the P/W on the passenger's seat will be described.
      <br/>
      If the P/W raising switch on the passenger's seat side mounted on the door on the driver's seat is depressed, then the level of a signal of the passenger's seat P/W raising switch inputted to the DDM 18 changes from high to low.
      <br/>
      This variation in input acts as a trigger, and the I/O communication IC 70 of the DDM 18 starts transmission of all input data connected to the I/O interface 71 and outputs a signal to the communication lines.
      <br/>
      The signal outputted includes information representing transmission of the input data of the DDM 18 and the actual input data.
      <br/>
      The information outputted to the communication lines is inputted to all of the modules.
      <br/>
      However, the I/O communication IC ignores following data since the information does not present the physical address of the I/O communication IC.
      <br/>
      The CPUs of the modules in which communication ICs are built are programmed so that they individually discriminate their function addresses and the communication ICs other than that of the BCM 14 ignore following data.
      <br/>
      The BCM 14 fetches the input data of the DDM outputted from the DDM 18 and performs discrimination calculation processing based on the data.
      <br/>
      Whereas this discrimination calculation processing may be performed immediately after the data are received, in the present embodiment, it is executed after each fixed interval of time.
      <br/>
      Since the P/W motor for the passenger's seat is changed from stopping to driving based on a result of the discrimination calculation processing, the BCM 14 outputs the physical address of the PDM 20 connected to the passenger's seat P/W motor, whose output should be changed, to the communication lines and then transmits output data to all of the actuators connected to the PDM 20.
      <br/>
      Whereas the signal on the communication lines outputted from the BCM 14 is inputted to all of the modules, only the PDM 20 whose physical address coincides with the signal receives the data.
      <br/>
      The PDM 20 outputs the received data to the I/O interface 103 to drive the actuator.
      <br/>
      In this instance, since the signal of the P/W motor is ON, the P/W motor operates to raise the P/W.
      <br/>
      According to such a communication procedure as described above, the P/W of the passenger's seat can be raised by depressing the P/W raising switch on the passenger's seat side mounted on the door of the driver's seat.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that, though not shown, where the vehicle is a four-door vehicle, four P/W rolling up switches are provided for the DDM 18 and also four P/W rolling down switches are provided.
      <br/>
      In this manner, input data to the LCU are all inputted to the BCM 14, and the BCM 14 calculates, based on the input data, control data for driving of all of the actuators connected to the LCU and transmits the control data by communication to the LCU.
      <br/>
      Since calculation processing for the control objects of the LCU is all performed by the BCM 14 in this manner, the LCU can be constructed such that it does not require a CPU which performs calculation processing.
      <br/>
      Between those modules which include a CPU, transmission and reception between the modules based on a physical address and simultaneous transmission and reception between a plurality of modules based on a functional address are performed.
      <br/>
      As an example, vehicle speed data are described.
      <br/>
      A vehicle speed sensor 1008A is connected to the PCM 10 (refer to FIG. 62) so that a vehicle speed is detected by the PCM 10.
      <br/>
      The PCM 10 outputs a functional address representing contents that vehicle speed data are outputted to the communication lines and then outputs the vehicle speed data.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Since the LCU cannot receive a functional address, it cannot fetch vehicle speed data.
      <br/>
      Each of the modules which require such vehicle speed data (in the present embodiment, the navigation control module 15, ABS 11, SDM 25, beacon 30 and BCM 14) discriminates the functional address and, if it discriminates that vehicle speed data are transmitted, receives following vehicle speed data and reflects the vehicle speed data on its respective control.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, the output of the LCU cannot be controlled directly from any module other than the BCM 14 which includes a CPU.
      <br/>
      All information necessary to control the LCU is inputted to the BCM 14 so that the output of the LCU is controlled by the BCM 14.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 4 is a state transition table of operation.
      <br/>
      The state A is a state wherein the battery is disconnected and all of the modules are unpowerwd.
      <br/>
      The state B is a state wherein those modules to which power is always supplied while the battery is connected (in the present embodiment, the BCM 14, FIM 5, RIM 29, DDM 18, PDM 20, RRDM 27, RLDM 22, IPM 17, DSM 26 and PSM 24) are operative, but power is not supplied to the other modules.
      <br/>
      The state C is a state wherein those modules to which power is supplied in the state B stand by for operation, that is, sleep.
      <br/>
      The state D is a state wherein the ignition key switch is at the accessory position (hereinafter referred to as ACC) and the modules to which power is supplied in the state B are operative and besides power is supplied to those modules to which power is supplied when the ACC is ON (the navigation control module 15, the A/C 16 and a radio and so forth which are not described in the present embodiment) so that the modules are operating.
      <br/>
      The state E is a state wherein the ignition key switch is at the ignition position (hereinafter referred to as IGN) and the modules to which power is supplied in the state B are operative and besides power is supplied to those modules to which power is supplied when the IGN is ON (in the present embodiment, the PCM 10, ABS 11, SDM 25 and beacon 30) so that they are operating.
      <br/>
      If the battery is connected in the state A, then the BCM 14, FIM 5, RIM 29, DDM 18, PDM 20, RRDM 27, RLDM 22, IPM 17, DSM 26 and PSM 24 start their operation.
      <br/>
      The I/O interfaces of the FIM 5, RIM 29, DDM 18, PDM 20, RRDM 27, RLDM 22, IPM 17, DSM 26 and PSM 24 are put into a high impedance state which is an all port initial state, and the I/O communication IC is put into a standby state.
      <br/>
      The BCM 14 transmits, after the initialization of the CPU 64, communication IC 65 and I/O interface 63, input/output directions of the I/O interfaces of all of the LCUs and initial output data to the LCUs from the communication lines to effect initialization of all of the LCUs.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, input data to all of the LCUs are received and ordinary control is entered.
      <br/>
      In this state, if some operation is performed, control corresponding to the operation (for example, door locking control) is performed.
      <br/>
      If, in this state, no operation is performed for more than a predetermined time (in the present embodiment, 30 seconds) and the state wherein all outputs are off continues, then the BCM 14 discriminates that the vehicle is in a state left as it is and executes a procedure of entering a sleep state of the state C. First, the BCM 14 outputs a sleep command at least once to the communication lines so that all of the LCUs may enter a sleep state.
      <br/>
      Each of the LCUs having received the sleep command stops an oscillation circuit of the I/O communication IC or the like to enter a sleep state.
      <br/>
      The BCM 14 thereafter puts itself into a sleep state.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the state C is established.
      <br/>
      If wake-up requirements are satisfied in the sleep state of the state C, then the system now enters the state B, in which it starts its operation.
      <br/>
      The procedure of the wake-up is such that, when an input to an LCU changes, then the communication IC of the LCU varies the potential of the communication lines, and if the variation of the communication line is detected by the communication IC of the BCM, then the communication IC generates a wake-up signal to the CPU and the CPU starts its operation to operate the communication IC.
      <br/>
      Then, a wake-up command is transmitted from the communication IC to all of the LCUs to wake up, and the communication IC starts its operation.
      <br/>
      All or the LCUs start their operation in response to the wake-up command.
      <br/>
      As an example, when the vehicle is in a state left as it is, that is, when the system is in the state C, if a driver of the vehicle inserts a key into a key cylinder of a door and unlocks the door, then the input to a door unlock detection switch connected to the DDM 18 varies, and in response to the variation, the system wakes up in the procedure described above and enters the state B in which its starts its ordinary operation.
      <br/>
      Or, according to another wake-up procedure, when an input signal connected directly to the BCM varies, then a wake-up signal for the CPU is generated in response to the signal of the variation and the CPU starts its operation to render the communication IC operative.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the communication IC transmits a wake-up command to all of the LCUs so that they may wake up to start their operation.
      <br/>
      All of the LCUs start their operation in response to the wake-up command.
      <br/>
      Transition from the state C to the state B occurs in this manner.
      <br/>
      If the ACC is turned on when the system is in the state B, then the system enters the state D. If the ACC switch connected to the BCM 14 is switched on, then the BCM 14 starts supply of power from the power supply and switching circuit 66 to the navigation control module 15, the A/C 16, and, though not shown in FIG. 2, those modules, sensors and actuators to which power is supplied when the ACC is on such as a radio.
      <br/>
      Further, the BCM 14 transmits a control signal via the communication lines so that power may be supplied from the power supply and switching circuit 130 of the RIM 29 to, though not shown in FIG. 2, a CD changer and so forth.
      <br/>
      The RIM 29 which receives the control signal starts supply of power from the power supply and switching circuit 130.
      <br/>
      If the IGN is switched on when the system is in the state B or the state D, then the BCM 14 starts supply of power from the power supply and switching circuit 66 to the module of the SDM 25, sensors, actuators and so forth.
      <br/>
      The module to which power is supplied (in the present embodiment, the SDM 25) starts its ordinary operation after it performs initialization.
      <br/>
      Further, the BCM 14 transmits a control signal via the communication line so that power may be supplied from the power supply and switching circuits 53 and 130 of the FIM 5 and the RIM 29 to the line 41 and the line 44, respectively.
      <br/>
      The FIM 5 having received the control signal starts supply of power from the power supply and switching circuit 53 to the line 41.
      <br/>
      The modules to which power is supplied (in the present embodiment, the PCM 10 and the ABS 11) start their operation after they individually perform initialization.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the RIM 29 having received the control signal starts supply of power from the power supply and switching circuit 130 to the line 44.
      <br/>
      The module to which power is supplied (in the present embodiment, the beacon 30) starts its ordinary operation after it performs initialization.
      <br/>
      If the IGN is switched off, then transition from the state E to the state D occurs, and if the IGN is off and the ACC is off, then transition from the state E to the state B occurs.
      <br/>
      The requirement for transition from the state D to the state B is that the ACC is switched off.
      <br/>
      Transition to the state A occurs from any other state if the battery is disconnected.
      <br/>
      Since power supply of the entire vehicle is managed by control signals by multiplexed communication from the BCM 14 and modules from which power is supplied are disposed in the proximity of modules, sensors and actuators to which power is supplied in this manner, the length of the power supply lines can be made short.

    <p num="16">In the following, the various elements of the embodiment of the present invention are described in more detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
    <p num="17">&lt;Description of Composite Cable&gt;</p>
    <p num="18">
      FIG. 5 is a view showing an internal construction of a power supply line and a multiplex communication line.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, a structure of a two core braided cable which includes a power supply line 13 (37, 38) for supplying power and a multiplex communication line 12 (36, 39) as well as a shield layer 5A which forms a short-circuiting sensor is taken.
      <br/>
      In the following description, the structure is referred to as composite multiplex communication cable 5Z.
      <br/>
      The composite multiplex communication cable 5Z is different from an ordinary shield cable in that a potential is applied to the shield layer.
      <br/>
      Since a predetermined potential is applied via a terminal 5C, if the composite multiplex communication cable 5Z is rubbed against or pinched by the vehicle body to break an insulating resin protective sheath 5B, the shield layer is first brought into contact with the vehicle body and the potential thereof drops to the ground (vehicle body ground).
      <br/>
      Therefore, by supervising the potential, a sign of occurrence of a short-circuiting accident of the power supply line can be discriminated.
      <br/>
      Further, where the shield layer is connected to the ground with a low impedance using a capacitor, there is an effect also for prevention of invasion of external noise of high frequencies or of emission of high frequency noise.
      <br/>
      Further, where the shield layer is made of a metal, since it is difficult to cut, there is an effect also for assurance of time until a short-circuiting accident of the power supply line occurs.
    </p>
    <p num="19">The composite cable is disclosed in detail in Japanese Patent Application No. 07/32647.</p>
    <p num="20">&lt;Description of BCM&gt;</p>
    <p num="21">FIG. 6 is a detailed block diagram of the BCM (body control module) This module is disposed in the neighborhood of the dash panel, and principally performs fetching of switches operated by a driver, supply of power to other control units installed in the proximity of the dash panel and control as a center of the power supply network using a power supply multiplex communication line which will be hereinafter described.</p>
    <p num="22">An actual controlling method is hereinafter described with reference to a flow chart.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The BCM 14 is connected via composite multiplex communication cables 5Z to nine modules for effecting power supply management, including the FIM (front integration module) 5 which effects power supply management of a front part of the vehicle, the DDM (driver door module) 18 which effects power supply management of the door on the driver side, the PDM (passenger door module) which effects power supply management of the door of the passenger and driver side, the RLDM (rear left door module) which effects power supply management of the rear door on the driver side, the RRDM (rear right door module) which effects power supply management of the rear door on the passenger seat side, the IPM (instrumental panel module) which effects power supply management of the meter panel of the instrument panel forwardly of the driver's seat, the RIM (rear integration module) which effects power supply management of a rear part of the vehicle, the DSM (driver's seat module) which effects power supply management of the driver's seat and the PSM (passenger seat module) which effects power supply management of the seat of the passenger's seat side.
      <br/>
      The BCM is the center which controls the modules in a concentrated manner.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Accordingly, only the BCM 14 includes a built-in microcomputer among the modules.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that the reason why a microcomputer is built only in the BCM is that the system can be constructed at a low cost, but a microcomputer may otherwise be built in all of the modules.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The BCM 14 is connected at an input terminal 14A thereof to the composite multiplex communication cables 5Z which form a loop.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the BCM 14 is connected to the two composite multiplex communication cables 5Z, and the two communication lines 12 and 36 are logically ORed via internal communication lines 601 and 602 and inputted to the communication IC 65 so that multiplex communication is performed.
      <br/>
      The reason why the communication lines 12 and 36 are logically ORed is that it is intended to prevent disconnection or short-circuiting of one of them from having an influence on the other of them.
    </p>
    <p num="26">A potential signal of the shield line 5C is inputted to a short-circuiting detection circuit 606 via internal signal lines 604 and 605, and a state signal of the shield line 5C is inputted from the short-circuiting detection circuit 606 to the CPU 64, by which it is used for detecting trouble in the composite multiplex communication cable 5Z.</p>
    <p num="27">
      Details of the short-circuiting detection circuit 606 are shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, the short-circuiting sensor shield line 5C interposed between different modules is fixed to a potential of 2.5 V, which is equal to one half a voltage Vcc (5 V), by resistors R1 and R2.
      <br/>
      The resistor R1 serves also to restrict the electric current flow when the short-circuiting sensor is short-circuited.
      <br/>
      Reference character S denotes a comparator, and a Schmitt circuit is formed from resistors R3 to R6.
      <br/>
      The threshold level of the Schmitt circuit is set to a voltage lower than 2.5 V so that, when the potential of the short-circuiting sensor is lower than the threshold level, the comparator S may output "H".
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the output signal of the short-circuiting detection circuit 6 is "H", the potential of the short-circuiting sensor is low.
      <br/>
      In short, this indicates that the short-circuiting sensor is in contact with an element having a low potential, and after all, this indicates that the composite multiplex communication cables are damaged and contact with the vehicle body ground.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The power supply lines are distributed by internal power supply lead-in lines 608 and 609 to a path inputted to a power supply switching circuit 610 and another path 612 logically ORed by diodes and inputted to a power supply circuit 611.
      <br/>
      The path which passes the diodes is used so that, even if switches in the inside of the power supply switching circuit 610 are completely off, supply of power to a microcomputer 607 or the communication IC 65 may not be cut off.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The power supply switching circuit 610 is controlled in accordance with a power supply switching signal 613 by the CPU 64 and is a circuit which switches to select one of the internal power supply lead-in lines 608 and 609 to be used.
      <br/>
      The power supply switching circuit 610 is provided in order that, even if one of the two power supply multiplex communication cables is damaged and put into a state wherein it fails to supply power, this may not have an influence on the other power supply multiplex communication cable.
      <br/>
      By this means, even if short-circuiting of a power supply multiplex communication cable to the vehicle body ground occurs, the damaged portion can be opened between the power supply switching circuits.

      <br/>
      FIG. 9 illustrates a state of the power supply switching circuit when the power supply multiplex communication cable between the FIM and the BCM is short-circuited to the vehicle body ground, and the switch B on the FIM side is switched off while the switch A on the BCM side is switched on so that the circuit of the power supply line at the location at which the power supply multiplex communication cable is short-circuited to the vehicle body ground is shut-off and no current flows any more.

      A power supply circuit 411 (611) has two power supply input paths as described hereinabove, and details of the same are described with reference to FIG. 10. FIG. 10 is an internal block diagram of the power supply circuit 411 (611).
      <br/>
      The power supply circuit 411 (611) receives two inputs of power supply from a power supply switching circuit 410 (610) and a path 412 (612) described above.
      <br/>
      The internal circuit has two independent circuit constructions and includes, as common circuit blocks, a power supply reverse connection protection circuit which prevents a break of the circuitry even if the battery is mounted with the (+) terminal and the (-) terminal thereof connected reversely, a surge protection circuit for protecting the circuitry from a high voltage which is generated when a battery terminal is disconnected during driving of the vehicle or in a like case, and a low-pass filter for suppressing a sudden variation of the battery voltage.
      <br/>
      Battery power from the power supply switching circuit 410 (610) having passed through those circuits is used as a voltage source 414 (614) for driving loads connected to the individual modules which effect power supply management.
    </p>
    <p num="34">The power from the path 412 (612) thereafter passes a power instantaneous disconnection compensation circuit which prevents interruption of power supply to the control circuit even if power supply disconnection for a short time which arises from chattering of a connector or a terminal occurs and then passes a control circuit driving power production circuit in the form of a constant voltage power supply circuit which produces power for the control circuit (in the present embodiment, 5 V), and is used as driving power for the microcomputer 64, the communication IC 65 and so forth.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The power supply line 614 outputted from the power supply circuit 611 is inputted to a control unit supply power switching circuit 616 and an interruption circuit 617.
      <br/>
      The control unit supply power switching circuit 616 is a switching circuit which supplies power to the other control units connected to the BCM, and is switched on and off by a control signal line 618 of the microcomputer 64.
      <br/>
      Incidentally, each of various control units employed in current vehicles (for example, a PCM, an ABS and so forth) has, in the inside thereof, a power supply protection circuit which prevents failure of the control unit even if the battery voltage becomes an abnormal voltage.
      <br/>
      Since this circuit is similar to that of the power supply circuit 611 described hereinabove with reference to FIG. 10, if a power supply module is used to supply power to various control units as in the present invention and the power supply protection circuit is built in on the power supply side, then it is possible to omit power supply protection circuits from the control units to which power is to be supplied.
      <br/>
      In other words, if the number of various control units to which power is to be supplied is large, then the cost can be reduced as much as the power supply protection circuits can be omitted.

      First, the cut-off circuit 617 is used in order to reduce the current consumption of a driver 621A built in an output interface 621 when it is not used.
      <br/>
      The driver used in the present embodiment is formed from a driver called IPD (intelligent power device) as shown in FIG. 12. In this IPD, short-circuiting or disconnection of a load to be driven is diagnosed by a diagnosis circuit 621C and a result of the diagnosis is outputted to the microcomputer 64.
      <br/>
      The diagnosis circuit 621C includes a protection circuit which detects, when over-current flows through an element 621B, such over-current and controls a driving signal 622a to limit the current so that the diagnosis circuit 621C itself may not be broken.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the current consumption (dark current) when the element 621B is inoperative is higher than that of an ordinary driving element.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, use of a large number of such drivers may possibly cause exhaustion of the battery.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent this, when the driver 621A need not be driven, power to be supplied to the driver 621A is cut-off on the upstream side to prevent consumption of current.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Second, the cut-off circuit 617 is provided for protection against a failure of the driver 621A itself.
      <br/>
      In particular, when the cut-off circuit 617 supplies power to its load although a driving signal is not received from the CPU 64, while it is conventionally impossible to stop the power supply, in the present embodiment, a cut-off signal 619a from the microcomputer 64 to the cut-off circuit 617 is cut-off to cut-off power, which is to be applied to the driver, on the upstream side of the driver to stop supply of power to the load.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      A detailed construction of the cut-off circuit 617 is shown in FIG. 11. The cut/off circuit 617 includes a switching device 617A for which a semiconductor such as an FET is used, and a state detection means 621D for monitoring an on-off situation of the switching device 617A.
      <br/>
      The switching device 617A is normally on in accordance with the cut-off signal 619a from the microcomputer 64.
      <br/>
      Also when the microcomputer 64 detects a trouble of the switching device 617A from the monitor signal from the state detection means 621D, the driving signal 619a disappears and the switching device 617A is switched off.
      <br/>
      Operation of the device 617A is indicated in Table 2.

      The communication IC 65 is an IC for exclusive use which effects data communication with the other modules using the multiplex communication lines built in the composite multiplex communication cables.

    <p num="43">The output interface 621 has a plurality of drivers 621A built therein for driving various electric load apparatus connected to the module 14, and one of the drivers is shown in FIG. 12.

    <p num="44">A signal line set 622 connected to the microcomputer 64 includes, as shown in FIG. 12, three signals of a diagnosis signal 622b, a driving signal 622a and an device diagnosis signal 622c.</p>
    <p num="45">
      The driving signal 622a is a signal for turning the IPD on.
      <br/>
      When the driving signal 622a is "H", power of a power supply line 614a is outputted to the room lamp 32, which is an electric load, so that the lamp is lit.

    <p num="50">As described above, the IPD, the element itself, has a function of discriminating a state of a load connected thereto, and as seen in Table 3, a "load open" and a "load short-circuited" can be discriminated from the relationship between the diagnosis signal and the driving signal.</p>
    <p num="51">On the other hand, if the IPD element itself fails, then also the diagnosis signal cannot be relied upon, and therefore, an output signal of the IPD is monitored as an element diagnosis signal as seen in FIG. 12. An impedance converter A and a resistor R have a function of preventing an electric influence on the IPD and another function of stabilizing the signal level when the element failure diagnosis signal is opened.</p>
    <p num="52">
      This circuit monitors a voltage applied to the room lamp 32 (load) after all, and by monitoring the three signals of the driving signal, diagnosis signal and element diagnosis signal, all states indicated in Table 3 can be grasped.
      <br/>
      In Table 3, the portion indicated by "-" (dash) represents whichever one of "H" and "L" is allowed.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if the driving signal is "H" and the diagnosis signal is "H" while the failure diagnosis signal then is "L", it is indicated that, although it is discriminated that the output state of the IPD is correct, no outputting is performed.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the driving signal is "L" and the failure diagnosis signal then is "H", it is indicated that no outputting is performed irrespective of the discrimination that the output state of the IPD is normal although the IPD is not driven.
      <br/>
      Further, when the driving signal is "L" and the failure diagnosis signal then is "H", outputting of the IPD is performed although the IPD is not driven.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In this instance, since both of the two cases are in abnormal states, it may be determined that the IPD is in failure.
      <br/>
      Then, when such a situation is entered, a secondary accident can be prevented by notifying to a driver of the vehicle or the like by sound or by an alarm lamp or the like that trouble has occurred and by switching off the switching element 617A of the cut-off circuit 617.
      <br/>
      A number of such drivers 621A equal to at least the number of electric loads connected to the output interface 621 are provided in the output interface 621.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      An input interface 623 is an aggregate of waveform shaping circuits for discriminating which one of the switches 25 to 31 connected to the BCM is on.
      <br/>
      The internal circuit of the input interface 623 is shown in FIG. 13. The reason why only one circuit is shown in FIG. 13 is that the other circuits are omitted because all of the circuits are the same, and actually, a number of same circuits equal to the number of switches are built in the input interface 623.
      <br/>
      Each of the switches is pulled up to a battery voltage (power supply line 14) by a resistor R10, and thereafter, it passes a low-pass filter formed from a resistor R11 and a capacitor C10 and the high voltage side is clamped by a Zener diode Z10.
      <br/>
      In short, when the switch is off, "H" is outputted, but when the switch is on, "L" is outputted.
      <br/>
      Those signals are inputted to the microcomputer 64 via an input signal line 624.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      It is to be noted that switches connected to the input interface 623 of the BCM include two switches for generation of left and right signals for turn switches to be used for declaration of turning to the right and the left, two light switches for lighting side marker lamps and headlamps, and three switches of the accessory ACC switch 629, the ignition power supply switch 630 and a switch 631 for turning on the engine starter motor, which are controlled by the key switch.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment, an automatic antenna motor 633 and a wiper motor 634 are further connected to the output interface 621 of the BCM.
    </p>
    <p num="56">An automatic antenna switch 635, a wiper switch 636, a speed changing resistor 636a and side view mirror control switch 637 are connected to the input interface 623.</p>
    <p num="57">
      Since power supply lines are wired in a loop in the vehicle and control units such as a BCM and an FIM for controlling electric loads are connected to intermediate portions of the power supply lines or to power supply lines branching from the power supply lines so that power is supplied from the power supply lines of the control units to terminal electric loads, there is no need of laying a plurality of power supply lines along to each control unit and there is an effect in reduction of power supply lines.
      <br/>
      Further, since they are integrated with data multiplexing wiring system, also information of a large number of operation switches can be fetched collectively, and since shorter wire harnesses to the switches can be used by transmitting the switch information by the data communication lines, saving of wires can be achieved.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that the power supply and switching circuit 66 (indicated by dotted lines) formed between the connector section 14A of the BCM 14 and the output interface 621 and output terminal 14B can be regarded as a power supply relay circuit.
      <br/>
      Then, the BCM itself can be regarded as one of power supply relay terminals.

      FIG. 14 is a block diagram of the FIM which is disposed at the front part of the vehicle and effects power supply management of the front part of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The FIM is basically different from the BCM in that it does not include a microcomputer nor an input interface circuit and consequently in that the signals inputted to and outputted from the microcomputer in the BCM are inputted to the communication IC 52.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      In the present embodiment, the FIM controls two groups including a group which effects supply of power to the ABS control unit 11 and the ABS solenoid 62 and effects supply of power to the PCM control unit 10, the fan motor 35 for an engine cooling radiator and the fuel injectors 9 to the engine, and another group which effects driving of the horn 8, headlamps 1 and 6, clearance lamps 1a and 6a, and front turn signal lamps 2a, 2b, 7a and 7b.
      <br/>
      Since the FIM does not fetch an input signal, the input interface provided in the BCM is eliminated from the FIM.

      For the communication IC 65 used for the BCM and the communication IC 52 used for the FIM, communication ICs of different types are used.

      <br/>
      While details of the communication IC 52 of the latter are hereinafter described, if data communication is allowed without using a microcomputer in this manner, a unit of an object of communication is not necessarily required to have a microcomputer built therein, and consequently, there is merit in that reduction in cost is allowed.

    <p num="64">
      FIG. 15 is an internal block diagram of the DDM 18 of a power supply module built in the inside of the driver side door.
      <br/>
      The door has a movable hinge element, and it is difficult to assure a space in which a wire harness is to be wired.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the present embodiment has a construction wherein, avoiding to wire the composite multiplex communication cables in a loop, the DDM is connected to a single composite multiplex communication line 5Za branched by a T-shaped branching connector 50A shown in FIG. 22. Accordingly, the DDM 18 does not adopt such a power supply switching circuit 410 or 610 as is adopted by the BCM or the FIM.
    </p>
    <p num="65">Basically, an cut-off circuit 517, an output interface 521 and an input interface 523 have similar constructions to those of the BCM or the FIM, and the DDM 18 is characterized in that a power supply circuit 511 has a simplified construction.</p>
    <p num="66">
      Details of the power supply circuit 511 are shown in FIG. 16. Since the power supply circuit 511 does not adopt a power supply switching circuit, power supply is not cut-off completely, and consequently, the two power supply paths, which are independent of each other in the BCM, are joined together while a driver driving power supply is branched from between a low-pass filter and a instantaneous power supply disconnection compensation circuit.
      <br/>
      Since the other circuit construction itself of the power supply circuit is the same as that of FIG. 10, description of the same is omitted.

      The DDM 18 principally includes a switch 75 and a motor 73 for operating the power window P/W, a switch 74 and a motor 19 for operating the door lock, and a switch 74A for detecting whether or not the door is in a locked state.

      A control switch for the motor 181A is connected to the input interface 624 of the BCM.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that switches 74 for operating the door lock are switches provided only for the driver side, and by operating this switch, all of the door locks can be operated collectively.

      In the present embodiment, the RIM drives a trunk opener motor 133, tail lamps 32, 33, stop lamps 31a, 34a and turn signal lamps 31, 34.

      Further, the beacon 30 is connected to the RIM from a power supply circuit 911 via a power supply line 914a and a switching circuit 916.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the control panel, display unit and loudspeaker for guidance by voice are connected to an I/O interface 129 of the beacon unit.

    <p num="81">
      FIG. 20 is an internal block diagram of the DSM and the PSM disposed in the proximities of the driver's seat and the passengers seat, respectively.
      <br/>
      Each of the DSM and the PSM employs motors in order to adjust the position of the seat (forward and backward sliding positions, forward and backward reclining positions and the height), and switches for such adjustment are provided at portions of the seat.
      <br/>
      Further, the respective switches are connected to the input interfaces of the DSM and the PSM and the respective motors are connected to the output interfaces of the DSM and the PSM.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      As described above, since power supply modules connected by power supply paths are disposed together with control units to which power supply is required or disposed in the proximities of locations where electric loads to be driven are concentrated, a plurality of power supply lines to a control unit or power supply lines to electric loads can be integrated, and besides, since the lengths of the power supply lines can be made short, there is an effect in saving of power supply lines.
      <br/>
      Further, where the power supply lines are integrated with an intensive wiring system, by collectively fetching information of a large number of operation switches and sending the switch information to the data communication lines, short wire harnesses can be used also for wire harnesses to the individual switches, and consequently, saving of lines can be achieved.
      <br/>
      Further, since a semiconductor is used for a switching device for controlling power supply to an electric load to form the switching device as an intelligent switching device and besides a cut-off circuit is provided, also when the electric load is short-circuited, the device can be prevented from being broken.
      <br/>
      As a result, there is merit in that a fuse box for the vehicle and fuses for individual electric loads can be eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="83">&lt;Description of Connector&gt;</p>
    <p num="84">
      By the way, for such a module as the BCM or the FIM to which two composite multiplex communication cables each integrated with a power supply line are inputted, a connector 5W shown in FIG. 21 is used.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 21, when a module is to be connected to the wiring side connector 5W, a dummy connector 5X is removed, and instead, a terminator of the module is inserted to establish connection.
      <br/>
      Same reference symbols as those of FIG. 6 denote same members.
      <br/>
      For such a module as the DDM or the PDM to which one composite multiple communication line is inputted, such a branching connector as shown in FIG. 22 is used.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 22, when power supply lines for a module are to be branched from the power supply lines, the power supply lines are separated and wiring connectors are connected to ends of the power lines and inserted into two terminals of the T-shaped branching connector while wiring connectors on the module side are inserted into the remaining one terminal of the T-shaped branching connector to establish connection.
    </p>
    <p num="85">&lt;Description of Additional Module&gt;</p>
    <p num="86">In the meantime, in recent years, a consumer having purchased a vehicle frequently attaches a car audio set, a navigation apparatus or a like apparatus, and if a additional terminal by which a power supply module can be added is provided in the proximity of the passenger's seat dash panel of a vehicle or in the trunk room in order to cope with such a need as just mentioned, then supply of power can be performed readily and safely.</p>
    <p num="87">
      Where two power supply multiplex communication cables are required, a dummy connector called terminator is connected to an additional connector of the type of FIG. 21 to form a loop, and when used, the terminator is removed and a connector of a power supply module of the BCM type is inserted instead.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, where it is considered that one power supply multiplex communication cable may be used, a T-shaped branching additional terminal shown in FIG. 22 is inserted, but when not in use, a cover is attached to the module connection side terminal.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      An additional module is higher in universality and can have variations in accordance with applications where it has a built-in microcomputer.
      <br/>
      For example, an additional module which itself has alarm sound or an alarm lamp, another additional module for an audio application which includes a reinforced noise filter, a further additional module which has a burglary prevention function, a still further additional module which has a function of an engine starter and so forth may be available.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      An internal block diagram of an additional module which includes one composite multiplex communication line is shown in FIG. 23. The additional module shown is much different from that of the DDM or the like in that it has a built-in microcomputer.
      <br/>
      Since the module for extension employs a microcomputer, it is programmed so that the microcomputer effects all control such as control of signals from input/output interfaces, signals of a short-circuiting detection circuit and an interruption circuit.
      <br/>
      Further, since the module for extension can be programmed for exclusive use therefor, finer control is possible.
      <br/>
      For example, where an additional module is supplied for an engine starter, a state of a door lock, a situation of a gear position, a starting situation of the engine and so forth can be acquired from the BCM or the PCM by data communication, and cut-off of power supply or the like when the function as an engine starter is not required can be achieved readily.

    <p num="90">&lt;Description of General Operation&gt;</p>
    <p num="91">
      In the following, operation of the power supply network for a vehicle is described with reference to flow charts and so forth.
      <br/>
      First, in order to facilitate understandings, input and output information to and from the individual power supply modules are described with reference to data tables of FIGS. 24 and 26. It is to be noted that the input and output tables are formed from 4 bytes (2 bytes for the input and 2 bytes for the output) for each power supply module.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      FIG. 24 shows data tables of data which are fetched as input signals by the individual power supply modules.
      <br/>
      Those tables are written in a freely readable and writable random access memory (hereinafter referred to as RAM) which is built in the microcomputer of the BCM.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case of the BCM, the table includes the position of the key switch, the position of the light switch and two kinds of diagnosis information of the room lamp, and if the ignition key switch is set to the ACC position (position for accessory power supply), then the bit 15 of the BCM of the RAM table is set (changed to "1"), but if the ignition key switch is set to the ON position, then the bit 14 of the BCM is set.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      In the case of the FIM, the table includes diagnosis information inputs of the side marker lamps la and 6a which are lit when the light switch 67 in the BCM is positioned to the position of a POS 627 (lighting of the side marker lamps).
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that diagnosis 1 and diagnosis 2 denote the diagnosis signal and the element diagnosis signal shown in Table 3, and short-circuiting detection (1) and short-circuiting detection (2) are used to indicate distinction of one of two power supply multiplex communication cables which is inputted to the FIM.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      Further, for input information for each of the ten total modules from the BCM to the RIM, 2 bytes are assured, and the microcomputer built in the BCM confirms, based on the input information, which one of the switches is operated and controls supply of power to a load to a module which makes an object of the control.
      <br/>
      Further, based on the diagnosis signals, the microcomputer confirms a load situation of each module or short-circuiting of a composite multiplex communication cable and effects alarming or control of power supply cut-off.

    <p num="95">
      FIG. 25 is a list of output data tables for use for operation of the electric loads connected to the individual power supply modules and control of the power supply switching circuits, control of the cut-off circuits and control of the switching circuits.
      <br/>
      The signals set in the table are transmitted to the individual power supply modules by multiplex communication and used for operation, and similarly as in the input tables of FIG. 24, for output information of each of the ten total modules from the BCM to the RIM, 2 bytes are assured.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      FIG. 26 shows tables for the other control units which effect multiplex communication separately from the power supply modules, and data communication is performed between the five units of the ABS, SDM, air conditioner unit, PCM and navigation unit and the BCM.
      <br/>
      Principally, information to be transmitted from the BCM to the units includes information of the ignition key switch, information of the light switch and information of the brake switch.
      <br/>
      As information from the units, in addition to a "power supply instruction permission signal" representing "to cut-off power supplied to the unit", an "operation OK signal" representing that preparations for operation have been made after power supply is started and a "trouble occurrence signal" for notification to a driver that some trouble has occurred with a system controlled by the unit, information unique to the unit is transmitted to the BCM.
    </p>
    <p num="97">Also those data are stored, similarly to the input and output tables described above, in the RAM built in the microcomputer of the BCM, and are used as part of control of the power supply network of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="98">
      In this manner, in the present embodiment, multiplex communication is performed between each power supply module and the BCM and between each control unit and the BCM, and the information illustrated in FIGS. 24 to 26 is communicated by the multiplex communication.
      <br/>
      While details of from where data received by the BCM have come or to where data to be transmitted by the BCM are to go are hereinafter described, each of the modules and the units has a unique name (address) applied thereto so that an object module or unit is distinguished based on the address.
    </p>
    <p num="99">Subsequently, how the functions of the present invention operate when a battery is connected to the vehicle is described in order with reference to FIG. 27.</p>
    <p num="100">
      FIG. 27 is a flow chart illustrating operation of the power supply network after a battery is connected.
      <br/>
      If a battery is connected first in step 1, then power is supplied, in step 2, to the communication ICs and the microcomputers which are the internal circuits of the BCM and the power supply modules (hereinafter referred to as LCUs).
      <br/>
      This power is different from the power to be used for supply of power to the electric loads and is normally supplied to the BCM and the LCUs.
      <br/>
      This power is, for example, in the BCM, the control circuit power supply 614b.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      When power is supplied to the microcomputer of the BCM, initialization processing of the microcomputer is performed in step 3.
      <br/>
      Initialization processing includes processes which are necessary for any product which employs a microcomputer, and processes to set the microcomputer to enable use of the input and output ports of the microcomputer, to clear the RAM and to make preparations for use of the functions of the microcomputer.
      <br/>
      Then in step 4, preparations for transmission of initialization data to all of the LCUs connected to the BCM are performed.
      <br/>
      Here, the switch situations of the power supply switching circuits of the LCUs are all switched on to make preparations for power supply to the electric loads and connection units.
      <br/>
      In step 5, the BCM fetches a switch input situation and a trouble situation from any of the LCUs connected thereto.
      <br/>
      In step 6, the processing in steps 4 and 5 is repeated until it is completed for all of the LCUs connected to the BCM.
      <br/>
      Since initial information necessary to start control is all acquired by completion of the processing up to step 6, processing execution start completion is set in step 7.
      <br/>
      The foregoing is the content of the processing executed without fail when a battery is connected.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      After step 7 is executed, ordinary control in step 8 is performed.
      <br/>
      The processes are described with reference to flow charts shown in FIG. 28 et seq.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Subsequently, processing when the power supply network is not used is described.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, when the system need not function, in short, when there is no need of supplying power, in order to minimize discharge of the battery, power supply to the electric load driving circuits of the LCUs is cut-off and the communication ICs and the communication IC 65 and the microcomputer of the BCM are put into a low current consumption mode (sleep mode) .
      <br/>
      First, in step 9, it is checked based on the output tables of FIG. 25 whether or not there is an electric load which is in operation.
      <br/>
      If some electric load is outputting, then the processing returns to step 8, in which the processing is repeated.
      <br/>
      However, if no electric load is outputting, it is checked in step 10 based on the input tables of FIG. 24 whether or not some electric load is planned to operate.
      <br/>
      If some switch is on or trouble has occurred, then the processing returns to step 8 similarly.
      <br/>
      However, if no switch is on or no trouble has occurred, then in order to cut-off power supply to the electric loads of the individual LCUs, a signal for switching off a power supply switching circuit and a switch switching circuit is set to the output tables in step 11.
      <br/>
      In step 12, transmission of the set data is awaited, and after the transmission is completed, the microcomputer enters a sleep mode in step 13.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that, if operation of some switch is performed in this state, then the microcomputer is released from the sleep mode, and the processing is repeated again beginning with step 7.

      <br/>
      This processing processes which is executed when processing which is hereinafter described is not executed, and principally executes diagnostic processes.
      <br/>
      In step 14, trouble detection processing for the power supply multiplex communication cables is performed; in step 15, trouble detection processing of the switching element of the output interface; and in step 16, trouble detection processing of a load to be driven is performed.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that details are hereinafter described.

      The fetched data here are stored into an input table described with reference to FIG. 24 or 26.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      First, in step 18, it is checked whether or not the microcomputer has been in a sleep mode, and if the microcomputer has been in a sleep mode, then since this signifies that the entire system is in a low power consumption mode, sleep cancellation processing is executed in step 19.
      <br/>
      Here, a sleep cancellation signal is sent to the communication ICs 52, 70, 77, 84, 102, 109, 120, 131 and 136 of all of the nine LCUs so that processing of returning the entire system to an ordinary state is executed.
      <br/>
      If the microcomputer has been released from a sleep state, then the processing advances directly to step 20, in which it is discriminated from address information of a signal received just now from which LCU or unit the data has been received.
      <br/>
      If the data has been received from an LCU, then a data storage address of the input table of FIG. 24 is calculated in step 21.
      <br/>
      If the data has been received from a unit, then a data storage address of the unit shown in FIG. 26 is calculated similarly.
      <br/>
      Then, in step 23, the received data is stored into the object address.

    <p num="109">In this manner, the processing of discriminating, based on an address of received data, from which module or unit the data has been received and storing the data into a corresponding table is the processing of FIG. 29 and is used also for cancellation of a sleep mode.</p>

      Principally, those processes for which a response time after a switch is operated matters are executed after the short time interval, but those processes with which some delay does not matter in operation are executed after the long time interval.

    <p num="165">In the following, the communication control system used in the present embodiment is described in detail with reference to FIGS. 42 to 60 and Tables 4 to 10.</p>
    <p num="166">
      The I/O communication IC effects transmission of a digital input signal via a communication bus to a control module which includes a CPU.
      <br/>
      Further, the I/O communication IC effects on-off control of digital equipment via the communication bus from the control module.
      <br/>
      By the way, a plurality of I/O communication ICs are connected to the communication bus.
      <br/>
      Therefore, each of the I/O communication ICs has such functions as described below which prevent interference of data communicated between the I/O communication IC and the control module.
      <br/>
      First, the communication ICs connected to the communication bus have respective unique numbers which do not overlap with each other, and transmission data include input/output data and the unique number of the apparatus which transmits the data.
      <br/>
      Second, each of the I/O communication ICs has a communication bus supervision function to prevent collision between data from a plurality of apparatus, and effects transmission when the communication bus is not used by any other communication IC.
      <br/>
      Further, if a plurality of units start their communication, then based on priority order data included in data, that unit which exhibits the highest priority order is allowed to transmit data to the communication bus.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      The I/O communication IC effects transmission in the following two cases.
      <br/>
      One of the two cases is that a digital input signal connected to it exhibits a variation, and the other is that a transmission request is received from the control module.
    </p>
    <p num="168">Further, the I/O communication IC receives data and sets the data to the output ports only when data on the transmission bus are analyzed and the data are destined for the I/O communication IC.</p>
    <p num="169">
      A circuit construction of the I/O communication IC is shown in FIG. 42. Functions of the I/O communication IC are divided into transmission, reception and transmission-reception timing controlling functions.
      <br/>
      First, a method by which the I/O communication IC transmits an input signal is described.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      In transmission, if a transmission request is received, then the I/O communication IC confirms that the communication bus is not used by any other unit and transmits digital data to the communication bus in accordance with a prescribed format.
      <br/>
      The data format includes header data, digital input data and data check data.
      <br/>
      If a transmission request is received, then an input signal is set from a digital I/O port to an I/O register.
      <br/>
      If the communication bus can be used, then data are set to a Tx register in order of the header register, receive address register, transmit address register, I/O register and CRC generator.
      <br/>
      The data set to the Tx register are inputted to a VPW generator, by which they are variable pulse width (VPW) modulated, and are then transmitted to the communication bus.
      <br/>
      The VPW modulation method is a method wherein digital data of "1" and "0" are transmitted with two different pulse widths and two different voltage levels.
    </p>
    <p num="171">According to this modulation method, when data being transmitted at present and the next bit are the same data, both of the voltage level and the pulse width are varied, but when they are different, only the voltage level is varied.</p>
    <p num="172">
      Here, in the header register, characters of following data such as priority order data of the unit are set in advance.
      <br/>
      In the receive address register, address data (the apparatus number) of another unit which is to receive data transmitted is set, and in the transmit address register, the transmission apparatus number, that is, the apparatus number of the unit, is set.
      <br/>
      The CRC generator is a circuit which performs CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) from the header register to the I/O register.
      <br/>
      Here, the CRC calculation is one of methods of error detection which are performed in data transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="173">In the following, a method by which the I/O communication IC receives data from the communication bus and set the data to the output port is described.</p>
    <p num="174">Data on the communication bus are inputted to a VPW decoder after noise components are removed therefrom by a digital filter.</p>
    <p num="175">The VPW decoder converts, reversely to the VPW generator, a VPW modulated signal to digital data of "1" and "0".</p>
    <p num="176">The digital data obtained by the conversion are inputted to an Rx register, and contents of the header register and the receive register are compared with the apparatus number and so forth of the I/O communication IC to discriminate whether or not the data on the communication bus have been destined for the I/O communication IC.</p>
    <p num="177">
      If it is discriminated that the data on the communication bus are destined for any other unit, then the following reception operation is not performed.
      <br/>
      When the data on the communication bus are destined for the I/O communication IC, the following Rx register is set to the I/O register.
      <br/>
      Then, when the OK output of the CRC check circuit becomes true, the contents of the I/O port are set to the output port.
      <br/>
      When the OK output of the CRC check circuit is false, a receive error is outputted to notify the transmission side that a receive error has occurred.
    </p>
    <p num="178">Here, the transmission and reception timing control of the communication IC is performed by a scheduler.</p>
    <p num="179">
      The scheduler is formed from a status registor, a stage counter, a byte counter and so forth.
      <br/>
      The status register is a register which represents a status of the communication IC (transmitting, receiving, transmission-reception error or the like).
      <br/>
      The stage counter is a register which represents a time series state during transmission or reception.
    </p>
    <p num="180">
      Here, when data are to be transmitted to the communication bus, in addition to the data from the header data to the CRC data, a special signal different from a data signal (VPW signal) representative of a start and an end is added.
      <br/>
      The start signal is called SOF (Start Of Frame), and the end signal is called EOD (End Of Data).
    </p>
    <p num="181">The stage counter is a register which represents one of the states of the SOF, data, EOD and no data.</p>
    <p num="182">The byte counter is a counter which represents which data the transmit or receive data (from the header data to the CRC data) are.</p>
    <p num="183">
      In addition, the communication IC circuit includes a clock generator which generates a signal.
      <br/>
      Here, signal lines connected to the communication IC include, in addition to the communication bus line and the digital input/output signal line, apparatus number, priority order signal and input signal number (or output signal number) lines.
    </p>
    <p num="184">
      Basic operation of the communication IC has been described in outline so far.
      <br/>
      The communication IC has, in addition to the operation for ordinary transmission and reception, a sleep operation mode in which those circuits which operate in response to a clock signal are stopped to suppress the power consumption to a level substantially equal to leak currents of the semiconductor elements.
      <br/>
      Transition into the sleep mode occurs depending upon transmission data from the communication bus or when the digital signal does not exhibit a variation for more than a fixed period of time.
    </p>
    <p num="185">Transition from the sleep mode to the ordinary operation mode occurs when communication data are sent to the communication bus or when a variation occurs in the input signal.</p>
    <p num="186">In the following, detailed operation of the communication IC are described.</p>
    <p num="187">
      Communication ICs are divided into two kinds including an I/O communication IC and a C/U (Control Unit) communication IC.
      <br/>
      The I/O communication IC effects interfacing between a digital input/output and a communication bus, and C/U communication IC effects interfacing between a communication bus and a CPU.
    </p>
    <p num="188">
      Both communication ICs have apparatus addresses (apparatus numbers) which do not overlap with each other and effect data communication with each other.
      <br/>
      An example of addresses of the communication ICs connected to the communication bus is indicated in Table 4.
      <br/>
      Here, the example is shown wherein the address is indicated by 1 byte and the upper 4 bits represent an address for identification of a control function while the lower 4 bits represent a number for identification of a communication IC in the same control system.
    </p>
    <p num="189">
      Here, any address whose number of the lower 4 bits is 0 represents a C/U (Control Unit) communication IC.
      <br/>
      The unit whose number of this is 0 has a function which can work data of the same control system.
      <br/>
      In the other units, the bit construction of data transmitted or received and the digital input/output ports correspond in a one-by-one corresponding relationship to each other, and the units have no editing working function.

    <p num="195">
      If the turn SW LH at 09 connected to the BCM at the address 30 is put into an on-state (when the left turn signal is turned on), then the turn SW LH processing program at 09 incorporated in the BCM is started.

      This processing program is transmitted from the BCM of the data at the output number 11 at the address 34 by which the TRN-L lamp is lit to the IPM, and also the output 08 of the FIM at the address 39 is transmitted from the BCM to the FIM.

    </p>
    <p num="207">
      It is to be noted that, when power supply to a communication IC is on, the ports of the communication are set to input ports.

      If this data is received by the I/O communication IC, then the I/O communication IC stops a clock signal and enters a low power consumption mode.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that data transmission between CPUs is different from transmission between an I/O communication IC and a CPU, and contents of data of individual bits are determined uniquely between different CPUs.
    </p>
    <p num="215">Subsequently, variation of the operation state of a communication IC is described.</p>

    <p num="218">The states are: 1. no transmit/receive data, 2. data being transmitted, 3. start of data transmission, 4. waiting for re-sending, 5. production of transmission data, 6. data being received, 7. data transmission by the other modes, 8. retrieval of receive data, and 9. sleep.</p>
    <p num="219">The state 1 is a state wherein no transmission data is present on the communication bus and there is no data to be transmitted and consequently a change is waited.</p>

      FIG. 68 shows a conventional example of a PCM system construction and illustrates a wiring line reduction effect by the present invention.

      Since an ignition switch signal is fetched by the BCM and transmitted by multiplex communication, wiring lines for a starter switch 1041 and an ignition switch 1047 can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Since power is supplied from the FIM to the PCM and an over-current state of the PCM is supervised by the FIM, fuses 1045 and 1046 on the upstream can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously, the necessity for wiring a power supply line from the battery to the PCM via the fuse box in the compartment is eliminated, and the wiring line can be reduced as much.
      <br/>
      The power supply line for backing up the battery is eliminated by transferring data necessary for backing up when power supply to the PCM is cut-off to the BCM by multiplex communication as hereinafter described.

      Since signals of the exhaust gas temperature alarm lamp 1049, engine alarm lamp 1050, OD off lamp 1051, defogger switch 1043 and OD switch 1044 are transferred by multiplex communication via the IPM as described hereinabove, the necessity for wiring individual lines to them is eliminated, and the wiring lines can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Since a signal of an air conditioner switch 1042 is transferred from an air conditioner control unit which is hereinafter described to the PCM by multiplex communication, the wiring line for it can be reduced similarly.

      FIG. 89 shows a detailed diagram of an internal construction of the air conditioner control unit 1300.
      <br/>
      The sensors 1301, 1302, 1303, 1304 and 13011 mentioned above provide analog input signals, and the analog input signals are inputted to an analog input interface 1310, by which they are converted so that they have a signal level (for example, 5 V of the full scale) with which they can be processed readily by a CPU (Central Processing Unit) 1314.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the switches 1305 to 13010 mentioned above are digital signals, and the digital signals are converted by a digital input interface 1311 so that they have a signal level (for example, 5 V of the full level) with which they can be processed readily by the CPU 1314.
      <br/>
      The CPU 1314 converts the analog signals mentioned above into digital signals by means of A/C converters and fetches the digital signals into the inside of the CPU.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the CPU 1314 fetches the digital signals mentioned above into the inside of the CPU from the digital input port via the digital input interface.
      <br/>
      Three powers are supplied from the FIM including power to be supplied to the upstream side of each load, power to be supplied to a constant voltage power supply 1317 for a communication IC 1315 in the air conditioner control unit, and power to be supplied to another constant voltage power supply 1316, the digital input interface 1311 and an output interface 1313 via a power supply cut-off switch 1318.
      <br/>
      The constant voltage power supply 1317 is a constant voltage power supply generation circuit for exclusive use for the communication IC and is normally energized unless power supply from the FIM is cut-off.
      <br/>
      The present circuit can be formed readily from a three-terminal regulator and so forth.
      <br/>
      The constant voltage power supply 1316 supplies power to the CPU 1314 and the analog input interface 1310.
      <br/>
      The power supply cut-off switch 1318 is controlled directly by the communication IC and is provided in order to cut-off power supply when trouble occurs with the motor loads (intake door actuator 13012, air mix door actuator 13013 and mode door actuator 13014).
      <br/>
      The communication IC 1315 is connected to the multiplex communication line 13017 via a communication IC interface 1312.
      <br/>
      Further, the communication IC 1315 is connected to the CPU 1314 and effects transmission and reception of data necessary for the power supply network via the multiplex communication line 13017.
      <br/>
      Since functions of the communication IC 1315 and the construction of the communication IC interface 1312 are similar to those described hereinabove, detailed description of them is omitted here.
      <br/>
      The CPU 1314 includes a ROM (Read Only memory) and a RAM (Random Access Memory) provided therein, and control software for the air conditioner control unit and initial constants are stored in the ROM.

      FIG. 90 shows a detailed construction of the output interface 1313.

      The load 13012 is connected in an H bridge formed from two sets of N-channel FETs (low side drivers) 1322 and 1323 and P-channel FETs (high side drivers) 1320 and 1321.
      <br/>
      Driving signals 1324, 1325 and 1326 controlled by the CPU 1314 are converted in level by resisters R and r and transistors 13210, 13211, 13212, 13213, 13214 and 13215 and drive the gates of the individual FETs.

      The state detection signal exhibits, based on the state of the load driving signal, such values as indicated in the following table (in the table, VB is the battery voltage, VDSH is the voltage between the drain and the source of the P-channel FETs, VDSL is the voltage between the drain and the source of the N-channel FETs, RL is the dc resistance of the load, and Z is the level fixing resistance value for the state detection signal).

      When the switch 1336 is on, the input signal 1338 exhibits a low level.

      <br/>
      A headlamp switch 1331 and an ignition switch 1333 provide input signals relating to the air conditioner control unit.

      FIG. 92 shows a conventional example of a system construction of an air conditioner control unit and illustrates wiring line reduction effects by the present invention.
      <br/>
      Since an ignition switch signal is fetched by the BCM and transmitted by multiplex communication, wiring lines relating to the ignition switch 1333 can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Since the air conditioner control unit receives supply of power from the BCM and an over-current state of the air conditioner control unit is supervised by the BCM, fuses 1340 to 1342 on the upstream can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously, the necessity for laying power supply lines from the battery to the air conditioner control unit via the fuse box in the compartment is eliminated, and wiring lines can be reduced as much.
      <br/>
      A power supply line 1343 for backing up the battery can be eliminated by transferring, when power supply to the air conditioner control unit is cut-off, data necessary for the backing up to the BCM by multiplex communication as hereinafter described.
      <br/>
      Since a coolant temperature sensor 1002 and a compressor clutch 1344 serve as input and output apparatus of the PCM, the air control unit is controllable by multiplex communication via the PCM, and reduction of wiring lines can be achieved.
      <br/>
      Since a signal is transferred by multiplex communication via the IPM as described hereinabove, the necessity for laying wiring lines individually to the headlamp switch 1331 is eliminated and wiring lines can be reduced.

      In the present embodiment, since the air conditioner control unit serves as a back up control unit when the BCM fails, it is discriminated by discrimination processing 1355 whether or not an ACK (acknowledge signal) of the BCM has been sent back thereto.
      <br/>
      When no ACK signal of the BCM has been received, since it is discriminated that the BCM fails, the processing advances to processing 1356, by which BCM back up processing is performed.

      In the BCM back up processing of the processing 1356, states of input apparatus connected to the BCM are fixed to predetermined values, and control of such control units as the FIM and the RIM which are controlled by the BCM is performed by the air conditioner control unit in substitution.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that, in the present embodiment, since processing in substitution when the BCM fails is performed only by the air conditioner control unit, the apparatus which performs such processing is not limited to this, and naturally it is otherwise possible that some other control unit or units having a CPU perform such processing in substitution exclusively or cooperatively.

      The sensors 1401 to 1404 described above provide analog input signals, and the analog input signals are inputted to an analog input interface 1410, by which they are converted so that they have a signal level (for example, 5 V of the full scale) with which they can be processed readily by a CPU (Central Processing Unit).
      <br/>
      The CPU 1413 converts the analog signals mentioned above into digital signals by means of A/D converters and fetches the digital signals into the inside of the CPU.
      <br/>
      Three different powers are supplied from the FIM including power to be supplied to the upstream side of each load, power to be supplied to a constant voltage power supply 1416 for a communication IC 1414 in the ABS and power to be supplied to another constant voltage power supply 1415 and an output interface 1411 via a power supply cut-off switch 1417.
      <br/>
      The constant voltage power supply 1416 is a constant voltage power supply generation circuit for exclusive use for the communication IC and is normally energized unless power supply from the FIM is cut off.
      <br/>
      The present circuit can be formed simply from a three-terminal regulator and so forth.
      <br/>
      The constant voltage power supply 1415 supplies power to the CPU 1413 and the analog input interface 1410.
      <br/>
      The power supply cut-off switch 1417 is controlled directly by the communication IC and is provided to cut-off power supply when some trouble occurs with a grounded type load.
      <br/>
      The communication IC 1414 is connected to a multiplex communication line 14010 via a communication IC interface 1412.
      <br/>
      Further, the communication IC 1414 is connected to the CPU 1413 so that it transmits and receives data necessary for the power supply network via the multiplex communication line 14010.

      Since the ABS receives supply of power from the FIM and an over-current state of the ABS is supervised by the FIM, fuses 1442, 1443, 1444 and 1446 on the upstream can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously, the necessity for laying supply lines from the battery to the ABS via the fuse box in the compartment is eliminated and wiring lines can be reduced as much.

      Wiring lines for backing up the battery can be eliminated by transmitting data necessary for backing up when power supply to the ABS is cut-off to the BCM by multiplex communication as hereinafter described.

      Since the driving element of the output interface can be used in substitution for an ABS motor relay 1445 and an ABS actuator relay 1447, they can be abandoned.

      Since signals are transferred by multiplex communication via the IPM as hereinafter described, the necessity for laying wiring lines individually for the ABS alarm lamp 1433 and the stop lamp switch 1432 is eliminated, and wiring lines can be reduced.
      <br/>
      While a vehicle speed pulse signal 1440 is outputted from the vehicle speed sensor mounted on the transmission, since, in the present invention, it is produced by the ABS control module and transmitted to another control unit by multiplex communication, relating wiring lines and sensors are unnecessary.
