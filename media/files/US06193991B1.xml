      Biodegradable delivery systems of physiologically, pharmacologically and biologically active substance(s) (BAS) are provided.
      <br/>
      These systems are obtained by incorporating the BAS into a blend of biodegradable polymers and plasticizers using a novel solvent evaporation method.
      <br/>
      This method involves dissolving the biodegradable polymer or copolymer and a plasticizer into a volatile solvent.
      <br/>
      The BAS may then be added to this mixture.
      <br/>
      The volatile solvent is removed using vacuum or at an elevated temperature or using a combination of both vacuum and elevated temperature.
      <br/>
      The resultant mixture is a BAS-loaded formulation which when injected, implanted or applied in vivo in an animal or human, provides controlled release of the BAS over the desired period of time.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a blank formulation may be first prepared by the aforementioned methodology without incorporating the BAS in the formulation.
      <br/>
      An appropriate quantity of BAS is then added to this formulation to yield a BAS-loaded formulation which may control the release of the BAS for the desired length of time.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to biodegradable delivery systems incorporating a biologically active substance (BAS).
      <br/>
      The present invention also provides methods for preparing these biodegradable delivery systems.
      <br/>
      The consistency and rheology, in vivo degradation rates of the biodegradable delivery systems, and release characteristics of the BAS from the biodegradable delivery system is controlled by modulating the type and concentration of plasticizers, and type and molecular weight of polymers and copolymers.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The term biodegradable polymers refers to those polymers which are slowly converted to nontoxic degradation products in the body.
      <br/>
      Examples of biodegradable polymers include polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polycaprolactone, polyhydroxybutyrate, polyhydroxyvalerate, poly(alkylcyanoacrylate), polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters, poly(aminoacids), pseudopolyamino acids, polyphosphazenes.
      <br/>
      Some of these polymers and their copolymers have been studied extensively for biomedical applications such as sutures, staples and mesh for wound closure, fracture fixation, bone augmentation and ligament reconstruction in orthopedics, ligation clips and vascular grafts in cardiovascular surgery, and dental repairs (Barrows T. Degradable implant materials: a review of synthetic absorbable polymers and their applications.
      <br/>
      Clinical materials., 1:233-257, 1986).
      <br/>
      They have also been used to prepare biodegradable drug delivery systems capable of releasing the drug or a biologically active substance over the desired length of time.
    </p>
    <p num="4">The advantages of using biodegradable polymers in biodegradable delivery systems of BAS are: ready availability of polymers, polymers used are nontoxic, biocompatibile and biodegradable, facile predictability of biodegradation rates of the polymers, ease of modification of the degradation characteristics of the polymers, regulatory approval of some of the commonly used biodegradable polymers, ease of fabrication of the polymers into various types of devices and the possibility of controlling the release of BAS by polymers over the desired length of time.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Release of a BAS from a polymeric delivery system depends on the physicochemical characteristics of the BAS molecule, polymer and other excipients, and the dosage form.
      <br/>
      The important factors governing BAS release characteristics from the delivery systems prepared with biodegradable polymers are polymer molecular weight, copolymer ratio, polymer hydrophilicity or lipophilicity, degree of plasticization, particle size and percentage of BAS-loading, hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of the incorporated BAS, solubility of the BAS in both the delivery system and in the biological fluids, physical form of the formulation (i.e. solution, suspension, gel or paste), and the method of preparation of the delivery system.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Several types of BAS delivery systems have been prepared from biodegradable polymers.
      <br/>
      These include microparticles such as microspheres and microcapsules (Schindler A, Jeffcoat R, Kimmel G L, Pitt C G, Wall M E and Zwelinger R., in: Contemporary Topics in Polymer Science, Pearce E M and Schaefgen J R, eds., Vol. 2, Plenum Publishing Corporation, New York, pp. 251-289, 1977; Mason N S, Gupta D V S, Keller, D W, Youngquist R S, and Sparks R F.

Neurosurgery, 74:441-446, 1991), and solutions (Dunn et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,938,763; 5,324,519; 5,324,520; 5,278,201; 5,340,849; 5,368,859; 5,660849; 5,632,727; 5,599,552; 5,487,897).
      <br/>
      All of these, with the exception of microparticles and solutions, need to be surgically implanted.
      <br/>
      This procedure is inconvenient and undesirable.
      <br/>
      Drug-loaded microspheres and solutions, on the other hand, can be easily injected.
      <br/>
      However, there are several inherent disadvantages of microparticles.
      <br/>
      These include the need for reconstitution before injection, the inability to remove the dose once it is injected, and the relative complicated manufacturing procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      While solutions described in patents by Dunn et al. offer the distinct advantage of ease of injection, an inherent disadvantage to the method of preparing solutions, as indicated in the patents is that, the amount of polymer which can be incorporated into n-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), the solvent of choice cited in their inventions, appears to be limited.
      <br/>
      This is particularly true when higher concentrations of high molecular weight polymers have to be dissolved in NMP by the method cited in the patents by Dunn et al.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there clearly exists a need for developing easily injectable, implantable or applicable biodegradable BAS delivery systems such as free-flowing and viscous liquids, gels, and pastes prepared from biodegradable polymers using alternative methods.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention relates to methods for preparing biodegradable delivery systems with or without biologically active substances (BAS).
      <br/>
      These biodegradable delivery systems are comprised of biodegradable polymers and plasticizers.

      The present invention also relates to the use of BAS-loaded delivery systems for obtaining controlled release delivery system of a BAS over a desired length of time.
      <br/>
      The resulting formulations may be either free-flowing or viscous liquids where the BAS is completely dissolved in the polymer-plasticizer blended liquids, or free-flowing or viscous suspensions where the BAS is suspended in the free-flowing or viscous polymer-plasticizer blended liquids.

      They can also be gels with dissolved or suspended BAS, or pastes with dissolved or suspended BAS.

      The method of the present invention involves dissolving one or more biodegradable polymers and one or more plasticizers in a volatile solvent or mixture of volatile solvents.

      <br/>
      The volatile solvent is then removed using vacuum or evaporated at an elevated temperature, or removed using both vacuum and elevated temperature.

      The resulting BAS-loaded formulation provides controlled release of the biologically active substance over the desired length of time.

      Alternatively, a blank formulation may be first prepared by the aforementioned method without incorporating the BAS in the formulation.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention relates to the composition of biodegradable delivery systems.
      <br/>
      These delivery systems comprise of at least one polymer and at least one plasticizer.
      <br/>
      The delivery system of the present invention may also comprise of at least one biologically active substance (BAS).
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      According to the present invention, the term polymer includes oligomer, copolymer and terpolymer.
      <br/>
      Biodegradable polymers are used in this invention because they form matrices that can control the release of BAS over a desired length of time, can degrade in vivo into non-toxic degradation products, and are available in varying physicochemical properties including varying hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, varying crystallinity and amorphous states, and varying solubility in solvents.
      <br/>
      Moreover, tailoring the release charactertics of the BAS from the biodegradable delivery systems, varying the consistency or rheology of the matrix formulation, and fabrication of the system with and without BAS can be easily achieved using this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In the present invention, plasticizers are used in varying ratios to convert a polymer from a solid state to a polymer-matrix of varying consistency such as a free-flowing or a viscous liquid, a gel or a paste.
      <br/>
      Plasticizers are chemicals added to polymers to improve their flow, and therefore their processibility (Billmeyer, F., Jr. Textbook of Polymer Science, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1984, p. 472).
      <br/>
      This is achieved by lowering their glass transition temperature (a temperature at which a glassy polymer becomes rubbery on heating and a rubbery polymer reverts to a glassy one on cooling), thus achieving a change in properties.
      <br/>
      A plasticizer can only plasticize a polymer when the molecules of the plasticizer can interact with the molecules of the polymer.
      <br/>
      Hence, the plasticizers act as lubricants between the polymer chains, facilitating slippage of chain past chain under stress and extending the temperature range for segmental rotation to lower temperatures (Martin, A., Physical Pharmacy, Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, 1993, p. 588).
      <br/>
      The degree or extent of plasticization of a polymer will depend on the amount of plasticizer blended with the polymer.
      <br/>
      Higher the concentration of the plasticizer, greater the extent of plasticization or flexibility of the polymer.
      <br/>
      If a plasticizer and a polymer are fully compatible with each other, then depending on the concentration of the plasticizer blended with the polymer, it is possible to obtain a polymer matrix of varying consistency or rheology such as a free-flowing or viscous liquid, gel or paste.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since plasticizers are available with varying physicochemical properties, including varying hydrophilicity and lipophilicity, it is possible to blend an appropriate plasticizer at a desired concentration with a selected compatible polymer such that the resulting polymer matrix has the tailored physicochemical characteristics, including varying hydrophilicity and lipophilicity, and consistency.
      <br/>
      The present invention also includes formulations wherein two or more plasticizers are used in a combination or blend of varying ratios.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The present invention relates to the use of BAS-loaded delivery systems for obtaining controlled release of the BAS over the desired length of time.
      <br/>
      The resulting delivery systems may be free-flowing or viscous liquids or gels or pastes wherein the BAS is completely dissolved in the polymer-plasticizer blended liquids.
      <br/>
      The delivery systems could also be free-flowing or viscous suspensions wherein the BAS is suspended in the free-flowing or viscous polymer-plasticizer blended liquids, or gels with dissolved or suspended BAS, or pastes with dissolved or suspended BAS.
      <br/>
      The consistency or rheology, physicochemical properties, physical form of the biodegradable delivery system (i.e. a solution in which the BAS is completely dissolved or a suspension where the BAS is suspended in the delivery system), rate and duration of in vivo biodegradation, and BAS release characteristics depend on a number of factors.
      <br/>
      These include: physicochemical properties of polymers such as type, molecular weight, glass-transition temperature, hydrophilicity and lipophilicity, concentration of the polymer; physicochemical properties of plasticizer such as type, hydrophilicity and lipophilicity, boiling point or melting point; and physicochemical properties of BAS such as type, hydrophilicity and lipophilicity, molecular weight, melting point or boiling point.
      <br/>
      In addition, the physicochemical interactions between the polymer, plasticizer and BAS also affect the rate and duration of in vivo biodegradation, and BAS release characteristics.
      <br/>
      For example, using the present invention, it is possible to tailor the release of a BAS (with specific physicochemical properties and the desired in vivo concentration), for the desired length time.
      <br/>
      This is achieved by blending an appropriately selected polymer with an appropriately selected plasticizer or mixtures of plasticizers.
      <br/>
      Besides controlling the release charactertistics of the BAS from the delivery system described in the present invention, an appropriate blend of the polymer and plasticizer also controls the consistency and rheology of the delivery system.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to extend the in vivo duration of stay of the delivery system by selecting a higher molecular weight polymer, since polymers with higher molecular weights generally degrade slowly in the body.

      This formulation is referred to as a blank formulation.

      The system could be loaded with a contraceptive agent, antipsychotic agent, anticonvulsants, antimalarial, antihypertensive agent, antibiotics, antiviral agents, and biologically active protein and peptides, and injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly to provide a controlled release of the agents for the desired length of time.
      <br/>
      Drugs such as antiinflammatory agents, analgesics and anesthetics could be injected directly into joints or sites in the body from where the pain is emanating, thus providing relief from the excruciating pain and making the joints more mobile.

      <br/>
      Increasing the percentage of drug in the formulations from 10 to 30% w/w increased the cumulative amount of drug released at the end of 350 hours.
      <br/>
      This increase occurred because, at higher drug-loadings, more drug is available on the surface of the formulations for release Moreover, a higher drug concentration gradient between the formulation and the dissolution medium is expected at 30% w/w drug-loading compared to the one at 10% w/w drug loading.

      This is because PEG 400 is very hydrophilic and is completely miscible in water, whereas, the aqueous solubility of TEC is approximately 6%.

      It is evident from the figure that decreasing the percentage of polymer in the formulations from 25% to 10% dramatically increased the drug release.
      <br/>
      This is because a decrease in polymer concentration from 25% to 10% and a corresponding increase in the plasticizer concentration from 75% to 90% resulted in a decrease in the glass transition temperature, viscosity and an increase in polymer chain mobility of the formulations.
      <br/>
      Hence, the formulation with 10% polymer offered considerably less resistance for drug diffusion through the matrix compared to the one prepared with 25% polymer.

      Intermediate drug release was observed from formulations prepared from TEC.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      This is because increasing the polymer concentration in the formulations from 16.67% to 33.3% increased the viscosity of the formulations and decreased the drug diffusion from the formulations.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a comparison of drug released from formulations with similar polymer to plasticizer ratios but varying plasticizer compositions revealed that drug release was considerably faster from formulations prepared with blends of 75% PEG 400 and 25% TEC compared to those prepared from 50/50% blend of PEG 400/TEC.
