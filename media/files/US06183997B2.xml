    <p num="4">
      The efficiency of a nucleic acid polymerization reaction has implications for numerous assays and techniques.
      <br/>
      For example, the ability to enhance polymerase activity in a PCR process increases the sensitivity of the PCR-based assay.
      <br/>
      We have identified, purified, and analyzed novel extracts, proteins, and complexes that improve the polymerization activity of nucleic acid polymerases.
      <br/>
      Included within the aspects of the present invention are methods for identifying compositions with a polymerase enhancing activity, methods for purifying and using these compositions, and specific extracts, proteins, and complexes that function to enhance polymerase activity.

    <p num="6">
      Manipulating nucleic acids with polymerization reactions is a fundamental component of biotechnology-related research.
      <br/>
      These reactions permit researchers to replicate DNA or RNA in vitro, which in turn allows cloning or amplification of specific nucleic acids or groups of nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      Numerous other examples exist detailing the critical nature of a nucleic acid polymerization reaction or a nucleic acid polymerization enzyme in a particular technique, including sequencing nucleic acids, mutagenesis of nucleic acid sequences, and producing nucleic acid probes for hybridization.
      <br/>
      Of particular current interest are amplification reactions, such as PCR, that have greatly increased the rate at which researchers can perform nucleic acid related experimentation.
      <br/>
      Extremely rare nucleic acids can now be amplified and manipulated using these techniques, which necessarily involve nucleic acid polymerases.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Using techniques with an amplification step has driven concern for the efficiency, fidelity, and sensitivity of the polymerase used.
      <br/>
      This has resulted in efforts to both analyze and optimize polymerization conditions for a variety of applications. (Lundberg et al., Gene 108: 1-6 (1991); Eckert and Kunkel, PCR Methods Applic. 1: 17-24 (1991); Ling et al., PCR Methods Applic. 1: 63-69 (1991); Brail et al., Mutat. Res. 303: 75-82 (1994); Garrity and Wold, P.N.A.S. 89: 1021-1025 (1992); Taylor and Logan, Curr.
      <br/>
      Opin. Biotechnol. 6: 24-29 (1995)) In particular, quantitative amplification-based reactions rely upon the ability to efficiently amplify each nucleic acid species present in a sample. (See Ausubel, et al., Chapter 15, In: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons (1992) and supplements through 1995.) Thus, both a concern for the accuracy of and a need for new methods to enhance the performance of amplification-based nucleic acid techniques exists in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      One way in which these concerns and needs have been addressed is through the use of additives to the amplification reaction.
      <br/>
      Different additives act at different points in the amplification process.
      <br/>
      For example, formamide has been used to increase the specificity of PCR with GC rich target sequences, which are particularly susceptible to intramolecular hybridization that may prevent hybridization with a primer. (Sarkar, G. et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 18: 7465 (1990)).
      <br/>
      It has also been reported that tetramethylammonium chloride increases yield and specificity of PCR reactions. (Chevet, E., et. al., Nucleic Acids Res. 23:3343-3334 (1995).) Hung et al. report the reduction in multiple satellite bands from amplifying complex DNA when dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is added. (Hung, T., et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 18: 4953(1990).) The multiple satellite bands often present problems in purifying the desired amplification product from the other DNA present.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Certain proteins have been used to stabilize hybridized nucleic acids during replication.
      <br/>
      For example, E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein has been used to increase the yield and specificity of primer extension reactions and PCR reactions. (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,449,603 and 5,534,407.) The gene 32 protein (single stranded DNA binding protein) of phage T4 apparently improves the ability to amplify larger DNA fragments (Schwartz, et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 18: 1079 (1990)) and enhances DNA polymerase fidelity (Huang, DNA Cell.
      <br/>
      Biol. 15: 589-594 (1996)).
      <br/>
      In addition, bacterial thioredoxin combined with T7 DNA polymerase (Sequence) has been used to increase processivity, but not at high temperatures such as those used in PCR.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Another way amplification-based assays and techniques have been improved is through the development of modified polymerases or the use of combinations of polymerases. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,566,772) For example, the TaKaRa long PCR kit employs two polymerases (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd; Japan), and a number of polymerase combinations were also tested by Barnes (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 91:2216-2220 (1994).
      <br/>
      Truncated Taq and T. flavus DNA polymerase enzymes that apparently exhibit increased thermostability and fidelity in PCR have also been suggested. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,149.) Combinations of polymerases with and without 5' --&gt; 3' exonuclease or 3' --&gt; 5' proofreading activity have also been used. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,523)
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Further, amplification-based assays and techniques have been improved through empirical testing of conditions, reagents, and reagent concentrations to optimize polymerization reactions with a particular enzyme.
      <br/>
      Temperature and length of amplification cycles, primer length, and pH, for example, are all conditions that can be optimized. (Barnes, Proc.
      <br/>
      Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 91:2216-2220 (1994).)
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      However, accessory proteins can be even more useful in improving polymerase activity and/or the processivity of polymerases. "Processivity" in this context refers to the number of enzymatic reactions occurring each time an enzyme binds to its substrate.
      <br/>
      In the context of nucleic acid replication reactions, "processivity" means the number of bases that can be replicated when the polymerase binds to a priming site.
      <br/>
      An increase in processivity directly relates to longer replication products.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Intracellular replication has been shown to involve accessory proteins, as characterized in E. coli, human, and phage T4 systems.
      <br/>
      The accessory proteins interact with polymerases to improve activity and provide the high processivity necessary to replicate genomic DNA efficiently while avoiding unacceptable mutation rates.
      <br/>
      Since the accessory proteins can be used in combination with the other improvements noted above, the development and application of accessory proteins holds particular promise for enhancing the results of nucleic acid replication-based reactions.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Accessory proteins have been identified in eukaryotes, E. coli, and bacteriophage-T4 and are thought to form "sliding clamp" structures. (Kelman and O'Donnell, Nucl.
      <br/>
      Acids. Res. 23(18): 3613-3620 (1995).) These structures are thought to tether the polymerase to DNA, thereby increasing processivity.
      <br/>
      The sliding clamp structures, however, have largely been studied in vivo and in model systems.
      <br/>
      Only in the case of T4 polymerase has knowledge of the activity of such accessory proteins been used to improve polymerization-based techniques employed by researchers in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, accessory proteins of the T4 holoenzyme have been reported to improve processivity when added to polymerization systems using T4 polymerase. (Young et al., Biochem. 31(37): 8675-8690 (1992); Oncor Fidelity (tm)  Sequencing System, Oncor; Gaithersburg, Md.) However, since the T4 accessory proteins are derived from bacteriophage, they are not likely to enhance polymerases from bacteria, archeabacteria, or eukaryotes.
      <br/>
      Thus, the use of T4 accessory proteins is believed to have been limited to techniques where T4 polymerase is used.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Accordingly, since present knowledge and use of accessory proteins has led to limited applications in replication-based techniques, there continues to exist a need in the art for new and more widely useful compositions for enhancing polymerase enzyme activity.
      <br/>
      The present invention meets this need.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention comprises extracts, protein complexes, and related proteins that possess nucleic acid polymerase enhancing activity which are useful in a variety of replication reactions known in the art.
      <br/>
      Thus, the extracts, protein complexes, and related proteins of the invention function to enhance a wide spectrum of in vitro nucleic acid replication reactions by providing, inter alia, replication products of superior length, fidelity, or both, and higher yields.
      <br/>
      As used in this specification and appended claims "polymerase enhancing activity" means the ability to increase the rate, fidelity, and/or yield of a nucleic acid polymerization reaction mediated by a nucleic acid polymerase, or to expand or alter the range of conditions under which such reaction does or may proceed.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In one aspect of the invention, extracts of Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu) cells are provided that enhance the activity of Pfu DNA polymerase.
      <br/>
      The extracts enhance nucleic acid replication product yields over a fairly broad range of concentrations and contain at least one polymerase enhancing factor.
      <br/>
      As used in this specification and in the appended claims, the term "PEF" includes purified naturally occurring polymerase enhancing factors and wholly or partially synthetic copies or active analogs thereof.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the invention, such extracts can be further purified by heparin affinity chromatography followed by sepharose gel purification.
      <br/>
      Additionally, PEFs can be identified and purified using the antibodies of this invention, discussed below.
      <br/>
      While Pfu cell samples were used and are specifically exemplified below, one skilled in the art will appreciate that other cell samples can be used to identify and purify PEFs.
      <br/>
      For example, other species of the archeabacteria Pyrococcus or Thermococus can be used as well as thermophilic bacteria cells and other bacteria cells.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In another aspect of the invention, PEF complexes are provided.
      <br/>
      The PEF complexes of the invention possess polymerase enhancing activity and generally comprise multiple protein subunits with a combined molecular weight of approximately 250 kD or above as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis and gel filtration of unheated PEF samples.
      <br/>
      An example of one PEF complex (P300) was purified from Pfu cell sample extracts.
      <br/>
      The predominant components of the complex are a 50 kD protein (P50) and a 45 kD protein (P45).
      <br/>
      However, the PEF complex contains other minor components with approximate apparent molecular weights of 150, 100, 85, 60, 55, 42, and 37 kD.
      <br/>
      At least two components (150 and 100) have been shown to be dimeric or polymeric forms of P50.
      <br/>
      Thus, the PEF complexes of the invention comprise protein components and function to enhance the activity of polymerases.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In another aspect of the invention, Pfu proteins possessing polymerase enhancing activity are provided.
      <br/>
      These proteins have molecular weights between approximately 42 and 60 kD.
      <br/>
      The 42-60 kD proteins may be used alone or in combination to enhance polymerase activity.
      <br/>
      Methods for purifying these proteins as well as the PEF extracts and PEF complexes from which they have been isolated are also provided.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The invention also involves two particular proteins, Pfu P50 and P45, which are predominant components of the PEF complex (P300).
      <br/>
      Detailed structural information on the Pfu P45 and P50 proteins are disclosed.
      <br/>
      The P50 protein is similar in structure to a bacterial flavoprotein.
      <br/>
      The P45 protein is similar in structure to dCTP deaminase.
      <br/>
      The structural information herein can be used to generate specific hybridization probes that detect the presence of nucleic acids encoding a protein that is part of the PEF complex, or related proteins from samples from other species.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the structural information can be used to generate proteins from expression systems known in the art, synthetic proteins, partially synthetic proteins, or proteins made from a combination of natural proteins, expressed proteins, and synthetic proteins.
      <br/>
      In addition, polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies that bind to PEF components can be produced, for example from purified P45 or P50, purified PEF complexes (P300), or another PEF of the invention.
      <br/>
      These antibodies can then be employed in assays and kits, well known in the art, in order to identify the presence or absence of a PEF.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Kits for replicating nucleic acids and methods for using the PEF complexes, specific proteins of the complexes, and extracts containing PEF are also provided.
      <br/>
      In addition, the complexes, proteins, and extracts can be used in compositions comprising a polymerase.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the polymerase will be one that is enhanced by the complex, protein, or PEF.
      <br/>
      The PEF extracts, complexes and proteins of the present invention are particularly useful in mixtures with nucleic acid polymerases, such as native polymerases and those produced by recombinant DNA techniques, and kits containing such polymerases.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Also provided in the invention are methods for identifying proteins or complexes that influence nucleic acid polymerases.
      <br/>
      The source of the protein can be any bacterial or archeabacterial species.
      <br/>
      Certain embodiments involve methods for identifying proteins affecting polymerases used in amplification reactions, for example, alpha-type DNA polymerases such as DNA polymerases derived from Pyrococcus and Thermococcus species.

    </p>
    <p num="26">
      As used herein, the term "PEF" refers to a naturally occurring protein derived from a bacterial or archeabacterial source (or wholly or partially synthetic copy or analog thereof) having polymerase enhancing activity mixtures of one or more such proteins, protein complexes containing one or more such proteins, or extracts containing one or more of such proteins, mixtures or complexes.
      <br/>
      The Pfu P45 and P50 proteins of this invention are illustrative of PEF proteins P45 and P50, which exhibit an apparent molecular weight of approximately 45 kD and 50 kD are predominant components of a PEF complex derivable from Pfu.
      <br/>
      Data relating to the P45 and P50 proteins is presented herein and details specific structural information on both of these components.
      <br/>
      The P45 protein appears to be the most active component, although full activity or stability may also require the presence of the P50 component.
      <br/>
      On SDS-PAGE, the PEF complex containing P45 and P50 as well as minor additional components migrates with an apparent molecular weight &gt;250 kD.
      <br/>
      One species of the PEF complexes of this invention is the P300 complex from Pyrococcus furiosus.

    <p num="27">
      The present invention is intended, however, to encompass other PEF proteins, mixtures, complexes, and extracts derived from organisms other than Pfu identified by techniques analogous to those provided by the following examples, or by use of the structural information on the PEF proteins described herein or derivable from the proteins described herein.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the invention is intended to encompass PEFs identified on the basis of protein sequence homology to all or part of the PEFs described herein, nucleic acid homology to all or part of the DNA sequence encoding the proteins described herein or DNA sequences described herein, or reactivity with antibodies to the proteins, complexes, or extracts disclosed herein.

      One skilled in the art is familiar with methods of generating analogs of proteins.
      <br/>
      Various techniques from publications in the art can be used to mutate, modify, truncate, or otherwise change a protein.
      <br/>
      Similarly, wholly or partial synthetic or recombinantly expressed proteins can also be generated from the information herein by those skilled in the art. (For example, Ausubel et al. (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, and supplements through February 1997.)
    </p>
    <p num="29">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="30">Screening for PEF Activity</p>
    <p num="31">
      Protein containing extracts from a number of different sources can be tested for PEF activity.
      <br/>
      The extracts can be prepared in a number of ways known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      One method was demonstrated with Pfu DSM 3638 cells.
      <br/>
      The cells are grown, a cell paste collected by centrifugation and then frozen at -80 (degree)  C. The paste was taken up with lysis buffer �50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM B-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 2  MU /ml aprotinin�, and thereafter the cells are lysed in a French press and then sonicated.
      <br/>
      Following sonication, the lysate is centrifuged and the supernatant, containing potential PEFs, is collected for assays.
    </p>
    <p num="33">1. Screening Assays for PCR-Enhancing Activity</p>
    <p num="34">
      One method of detecting thermostable PEFs is by screening partially-purified fractions from thermophilic archeabacterial or bacterial extracts for PCR enhancing activity.
      <br/>
      PCR enhancing activity can be detected in samples consisting of column-purified fractions as well as homogeneous protein samples and proteins recovered by elution from SDS-PAGE gel slices (see below).
      <br/>
      Samples are added to PCR amplification reactions containing DNA polymerase, buffer, dNTPs, primers, and DNA template.
      <br/>
      PCR enhancing activity is identified by an increase in PCR product yield for amplifications conducted in the presence of a particular sample (DNA polymerase+PEF) as compared to amplifications conducted in the absence of added sample (DNA polymerase only).
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      When screening samples suspected of containing endogenous DNA polymerase activity, for example protein extracts, negative controls can be performed in which the exogenous DNA polymerase has been omitted from the PCR amplifications.
      <br/>
      In addition, when screening samples contaminated with DNA, negative controls can be carried out in which exogenous DNA template is omitted from the PCR amplifications.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The sensitivity of the PCR enhancing assay is dependent on the complexity of the DNA targets employed.
      <br/>
      PCR reaction parameters (target complexity, DNA template concentration, polymerase concentration, PCR cycle number or extension time) can be adjusted so that the yield of PCR product is barely detectable under normal conditions.
      <br/>
      In addition, samples can be diluted appropriately so that the concentration of PEFs falls within the detectable range of the PCR enhancing activity assay.
    </p>
    <p num="37">2. Screening Assays for PCR-Enhancing Activity Using Pfu-derived Samples</p>
    <p num="38">
      For screening PEFs from Pyrococcus furiosus, a master PCR cocktail was prepared consisting of: 200  MU M each dNTP, 2  MU g/ml primer F432-21 (5'-CTA-TTG-AGT-ACG-AAC-GCC-ATC) (SEQ ID NO.: 49); 2  MU g/ml primer R6656-20 (GTC-ACG-CTT-GCT-CCA-CTC-CG) (SEQ ID NO.: 50), 2.5  MU g/ml  LAMBDA AA742 DNA (transgenic mouse DNA with 40 copies of the lac1 transgene), 1 * cloned Pfu DNA polymerase PCR buffer (10 mM KCl, 10 mM (NH4)2 SO4, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 100  MU g/ml BSA), and 25 U/ml cloned Pfu DNA polymerase.
      <br/>
      Samples were diluted in 1 * cloned Pfu DNA polymerase PCR buffer, and 1  MU l of each diluted sample was added to 24  MU l of the PCR cocktail.
      <br/>
      PCR amplifications were conducted on the RoboCycler 96 Temperature Cycler (Stratagene), using the following conditions: 96 (degree)  C. for 45 s (1 cycle)/96 (degree)  C. for 45 s; 60 (degree)  C. for 45 s; 72 (degree)  C. for 14 min. (35 cycles)/72 (degree)  C. for 10 min. (1 cycle).
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      PCR products (10  MU l/lane) are run out on 1% agarose gels and PCR product bands visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
      <br/>
      Samples with PCR enhancing activity exhibit higher yields of the expected 6.2 kb PCR product than can be obtained in the presence of DNA polymerase alone.
      <br/>
      When PCR enhancement is due to the presence of PEFs, rather than contaminating endogenous DNA polymerase activity, amplifications performed in the absence of exogenous DNA polymerase (e.g. Pfu DNA polymerase) yield no PCR product.
      <br/>
      Moreover, PCR amplifications performed in the absence of exogenous DNA template should yield no PCR product when the PEF sample lacks contaminating target DNA.
    </p>
    <p num="40">3. Screening Assays for Nucleic Acid Replication Enhancing Activity</p>
    <p num="41">
      Extracts can also be added to any nucleic acid replication reaction to determine PEF activity.
      <br/>
      Many of these reactions are known in the art, including primer extension reactions, DNA sequencing reactions, site-directed mutagenesis reactions, and a number of PCR-based reactions. (Ausubel, F. M., et al. (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-lnterscience, New York, N.Y.; Sambrook, J., et al. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.) By comparing the results produced in a nucleic acid replication reaction with and without the added extract, one can identify the presence of PEF.
    </p>
    <p num="42">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="43">Purification of PEF from P. furiosus</p>
    <p num="44">
      Once PCR enhancing activity has been detected from, for example, archeabacterial or bacterial sources, large amounts of purified PEF can be obtained by column chromatography.
      <br/>
      The following protocol was developed for purifying PEF from P. furiosus (Pfu).
      <br/>
      However, one skilled in the art will appreciate that other cells or species could be used as well.

Then, 500 grams of frozen cell paste was transferred to a 4 liter stainless steel beaker on ice.
      <br/>
      The cells were resuspended with 2 liters of lysis buffer, consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM B-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 2  MU g/ml aprotinin.
      <br/>
      The cells were lysed in the French press using 2 passes at 8K PSI and the lysate was then sonicated for 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      Following sonication, the lysate was transferred to 400 ml bottles, spun for 1 hour at 9K rpm in a Sorvall RC-2B centrifuge using a Sorvall GS3 rotor, and the supernatant collected.

      This method allows rapid assessment of the number of PEF proteins in a particular sample and identification of their apparent molecular weight.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Pfu protein samples with PCR enhancing activity were electrophoresed on 4-20% acrylamide/2.6% bis-acrylamide Tris-Glycine gels (Novex), along-side pre-stained molecular weight markers.
      <br/>
      Samples were loaded in the presence of 2% SDS, but were not boiled in order to prevent dissociation of PEF complexes.
      <br/>
      The gels were run in Tris-Glycine buffer containing 1% SDS, and after electrophoresis, were washed briefly in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)/1 mM EDTA.
      <br/>
      Then, 2-3 mm gel slices were excised from the lanes of interest using the pre-stained molecular weight markers as a guide.
      <br/>
      Each gel slice was cut-up with a razor blade and the pieces transferred to 50  MU l of elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)/1 mM EDTA/0.1% Tween-20).

    <p num="57">Identification of the PCR Enhancing Activity in P. furiosus Partially-Purified Column Fractions</p>
    <p num="58">
      The fractions collected after the heparin sepharose chromatography were analyzed for PEF activity using the PCR screening assay.
      <br/>
      The addition of diluted heparin sepharose fraction dramatically increased yields of PCR products generated with cloned Pfu DNA polymerase.
      <br/>
      The PCR enhancing activity of the fractions was shown to be dependent upon the presence of exogenous DNA template (FIG. 1) and Pfu DNA polymerase (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      Increased PCR product yield was, therefore, not due to the presence of contaminating DNA template or native Pfu DNA polymerase, but rather to the presence of PEFs.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      In order to further characterize the factor or factors responsible, the following was performed.
      <br/>
      PEFs after heparin sepharose chromatography were identified by screening SDS-PAGE gel-purified samples for PCR enhancing activity, as discussed above.
      <br/>
      When the protein samples were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels without pre-boiling, PCR enhancing activity was recovered in 2 gel slices (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      One gel slice (gel slice -1) was excised from a position between the 42 and 60 kD markers, while the second gel slice (slice -2) was recovered from a site just above the 250 kD marker (FIG. 4).
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The proteins eluted from the gel slices were also screened for DNA polymerase activity to demonstrate that PCR enhancing activity was not related to contaminating DNA polymerase activity (FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      The results indicated that SDS-PAGE purified proteins with PCR enhancing activity lack significant DNA polymerase activity.
      <br/>
      Moreover, SDS-PAGE purified Pfu DNA polymerase lacks PCR enhancing activity when tested at protein concentrations comparable or greater than those of gel-purified PEFs.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The P. furiosus PEF proteins were conclusively identified by re-analyzing gel purified samples with PCR enhancing activity on silver stained SDS-PAGE gels.
      <br/>
      In the absence of pre-boiling, the predominant band in gel slice -2 migrates somewhat slower than the 250 kD molecular weight marker, consistent with the site where the gel slice was recovered (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      This band is called P300 or PEF complex.
      <br/>
      In addition, a minor band is evident at 50 kD, called P50.

      Gel slice -1 contained a major band at 50 kD and a minor band at 45 kD.

      <br/>
      A minor or poorly staining component of .apprxeq.45 kD is also visible.
      <br/>
      These results are consistent with P. furiosus PEF consisting of two distinct proteins, with apparent molecular weights of 50 kD and 45 kD, and which aggregate at low temperatures in presence of SDS to produce a complex which migrates as a discrete band at 300 kD.

      A discrete band in SDS-PAGE migrates above the 250 kD marker when the sample is not heated prior to electrophoresis.
      <br/>
      This protein is called P300 or PEF complex.
      <br/>
      When the conditions are changed to substantially dissociate the PEF complex, the subunit protein components of the PEF complex are visualized in SDS-PAGE.
    </p>
    <p num="66">1. Temperature-dependent Dissociation of PEF Complex</p>
    <p num="67">
      One method of dissociating PEF complex into its component proteins is heat treatment.
      <br/>
      In the absence of heating, the majority of PEF migrates as a complex, running slightly slower than the 250 kD molecular weight marker.
      <br/>
      Minor amounts of dissociated P50 and P45 are visible in the unheated sample.
      <br/>
      However, after heat treatment at temperatures of about 85 (degree)  C. or higher, the PEF complex is completely dissociated as indicated by the absence of the 300 kD band by SDS-PAGE.
      <br/>
      The predominant protein component of PEF complex exhibits an apparent molecular weight of approximately 50 kD in SDS-PAGE.
      <br/>
      The P50 band is shown in the gel of FIG. 7, where the protein was heated to  &gt;= 85 (degree)  C. in the presence of 2% SDS and BME prior to loading.
      <br/>
      In addition, the P45 protein shown to be present in the gel-purified PEF complex (FIG. 6) is also evident in the heat-treated, S200-purified PEF sample (FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, minor components with apparent molecular weights of approximately 37, 42, 55, 60, 85, 100, and 150 kD were also detected in SDS-PAGE analyses of PEF complex treated at temperatures of 85-100 (degree)  C. These minor components may represent additional forms of P50 and P45 generated by heat treatment (e.g. dimers, trimers, fragments) or minor unrelated species.

    <p num="68">2. Polymerase Enhancing Activity of PEF Complex and Component Proteins and Mixtures</p>
    <p num="69">
      Analysis of SDS-PAGE gel slice eluates indicates that PCR enhancing activity of S200-purified P. furiosus PEF can be attributed solely to the 45 kD species plus the 50 kD species.
      <br/>
      When an S200-purified preparation was loaded in the absence of heating (FIG. 7, prep. 1), PCR enhancing activity was present in gel slices recovered just above the 250 kD marker and between the 42 and 60 kD markers.
      <br/>
      When heated to 85 (degree)  C. before loading, PCR enhancing activity migrated between the 42 and 60 kD markers (FIG. 8).
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Titration experiments showed that the PCR enhancing titer of gel purified proteins migrating with apparent mass between 42 kD and 60 kD was not significantly different from that of the gel-purified PEF complex (300 kD band).
      <br/>
      The levels of PCR enhancing activity migrating between the 148 and 60 kD markers were insignificant, thereby indicating that the 85 kD, 100 kD, and 150 kD bands do not contribute substantially to full PCR enhancing activity of the PEF complex (P300).
      <br/>
      Moreover, these components do not appear to further enhance the activity of PEF.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Protein components of S200-purified PEF were purified by SDS-PAGE and the PCR enhancing titer was determined by adding serial dilutions of each gel slice eluate to PCR reactions with cloned Pfu DNA polymerase PCR reactions.
      <br/>
      The protein or protein mixtures which exhibited the highest levels of polymerase enhancing activity were identified by running the eluates on silver stained SDS-PAGE gels.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9 shows the proteins recovered from 4 gel slices between the 42 and 60 kD markers from 2 heated treated PEF samples.
      <br/>
      The greatest PCR enhancements were observed for protein samples run in lanes 5, 9, and 10.
      <br/>
      These lanes contained the highest amounts of P45, in addition to low but detectable amounts of P50.
      <br/>
      Relative P50 concentration did not necessarily correlate with highest PCR enhancing titer, as the proteins run in lane 4 (where only P50 is visible) exhibited a lower titer than the protein mixture in lane 5 (same amount of P50, plus P45).
      <br/>
      Moreover, samples in lanes 9 and 10 exhibited similarly high PCR enhancing titers and levels of P45, but the sample in lane 9 contained 10 to 1000-fold more P50 than the sample in lane 10.
      <br/>
      These results are consistent with P45 being the most active component of the PEF complex.
      <br/>
      Since all samples of P45 isolated to date contain varying concentrations of P50, the exact biochemical role a low concentration of P50 has on attaining full PEF activity or stability has not been determined.

      In the first study, heparin sepharose-purified PEF samples (.apprxeq.20% homogeneous; prep. 4 in FIG. 10) were electrophoresed and electroblotted onto PDVF filters.

      <br/>
      Blots were sent to Wistar Sequencing Facility (Philadelphia, Pa.) for analysis. N-terminal sequence analysis was performed on both the 50 kD (P50) protein (heated SDS-PAGE sample) and the &gt;250 kD PEF complex (unheated SDS-PAGE sample).
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the PEF complex (P300) and the 50 kD component (Pfu P50) were found to be substantially identical (Table 1).

      This data confirmed that Pfu P50 is the predominant component of the PEF complex.
      <br/>
      Two distinct sequences were found for both P300 and P50 (1 (degree)  and 2 (degree) ), suggesting that Pfu PEF may contain 2 different 50 kD species which co-migrate, or that the PVDF strip containing the 50 kD species was contaminated with the 45 kD species or other species visible by SDS-PAGE.

      There are inconsistencies between the chemically-determined AA sequence of P50 and the AA sequence derived from the P. furiosus DFP genomic clone.
      <br/>
      One skilled in the art is familiar with many reasons for this type of inconsistency.
      <br/>
      For example, the inconsistencies below can, largely, be explained by known limitations common to the procedures used.
      <br/>
      These limitations do not operate to limit the structural knowledge of proteins or nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      Instead, they merely indicate possible variations in the sequences of amino acids or nucleic acids by a finite number.

    </p>
    <p num="108">
      The inconsistency in Table A sequence at cycle 2 (extra AA between AA1 and 2) may be due to contamination with P45, which appears to have L's at positions 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      Moreover, L at cycle 2 in SEQ ID NO: 1 was assigned tentatively.
      <br/>
      Other inconsistencies between the Table A sequence and the predicted sequence occur at AA 15 (R vs. K) and AA 32-34 (VEP vs. LDV).
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      An inconsistency between the Table B sequence and the predicted sequence was found at AA13.
      <br/>
      The identification of AA13 as L instead of S is explained by the poor recovery of S in chemical sequencing and the contamination of P50 with low amounts of P45, which has a L at that position.

      <br/>
      An A was recovered at cycle 4 instead of a V, and a V was recovered at cycle 12 instead of a S. The inconsistencies may be due to the difficulties associated with interpreting sequences from a sample that is not absolutely pure.

    </p>
    <p num="115">
      The DNA sequence of a P50 clone exhibits very strong homology to the flavoprotein DFP, a protein identified in E. coli as playing a role in DNA synthesis and pantothenate metabolism (Spitzer and Weiss, J. Bacteriol. 164:994-1003 (1985) and Spitzer, Jimenez-Billini, and Weiss, J. Bacteriol. 170:872-876 (1988)).
      <br/>
      Although DFP was found to be an essential gene for DNA replication, these authors were not able to elucidate its role in DNA replication.
      <br/>
      The sequences in Table 1 (N-terminal 1 (degree)  sequence, tryptic peptides 107/108 and 112) are all found in the translated P50 clone, which exhibits very high homology to DFP.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the P50 amino acid and DNA sequence information can be used to identify related proteins associated with PEF complexes from other sources such as bacteria.

      From the above comparison, it would be apparent to one of skill in the art that related proteins from other species can be identified and isolated by methods known in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, the example above employed very stringent screening conditions.
      <br/>
      A less stringent condition, varying the concentration of salts, detergent, or the temperature during hybridization or washing, as known in the art, would lead to related clones from libraries containing sequences of any of a number of species.
      <br/>
      For example, in addition to the conditions described above, any of the following hybridization conditions can be used, in any combination, in methods to isolate DNA sequences related to the P50 or P45 sequences herein:
      <br/>
      low stringency wash in a solution comprising approx. 0.45 M NaCl, approx. 0.045 M trisodium citrate, and approx. 0.1% SDS, at approx. 37 (degree)  to approx. 42 (degree)  C.;
      <br/>
      hybridization buffer comprising approx. 0.75M NaCl, approx. 0.15 M Tris, approx. 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, approx. 0.075 M trisodium citrate, and approx. 50% formamide;
      <br/>
      hybridization buffer comprising approx. 5 * SSC, approx. 5 * Denhardt's, approx. 5% Dextran Sulfate, approx. 50% formamide, and approx. 0.1 mg/ml ssDNA;
      <br/>
      hybridization wash comprising approx. 0.1 M phosphate, approx. 0.1 * SET, approx. 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, and approx. 0.1% SDS at approx. 45 (degree)  C.

    <p num="120">
      The absorbance spectrum of purified P. furiosus PEF complex reveals two peaks of absorbance at 370 and 450 nm.
      <br/>
      FIG. 13 depicts the absorbance spectrum of S-200 purified P. furiosus PEF.
      <br/>
      These data indicate and are consistent with PEF complex comprising at least one flavoprotein.
      <br/>
      Sequencing data also verify the identification of Pfu P50 as a homolog of the E. coli DFP protein. E. coli DFP is a flavoprotein containing a non-covalently associated FMN moiety.
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      Up to this point, flavoproteins have not been directly implicated as part of the replication machinery.
      <br/>
      The involvement of a flavoprotein in PCR enhancement suggests a role for redox reactions.
      <br/>
      The only redox reaction involved in DNA synthesis is the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides, which is catalyzed by ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase.
      <br/>
      In vitro, the ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme can be coupled to NADPH via two known pathways involving FAD-containing oxidoreductases (Pigiet and Conley, J. Biol. Chem. 252:6367-72 (1977); Thelander and Reichard, Ann.
      <br/>
      Rev. Biochem. 48:133-158 (1979)).
      <br/>
      One pathway involves thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase.
      <br/>
      Interestingly, E. coli thioredoxin has been shown to act as an accessory protein and confer processivity on T7 DNA polymerase.
      <br/>
      An alternate hypothesis for the role of a flavoprotein in PCR enhancement is that a flavoprotein may be required for the continuous processing or activation of other proteins or cofactors needed for nucleic acid replication.

      A Lambda phage Pfu genomic library was used as template for PCR amplification of the P45 sequence.
      <br/>
      The four degenerate oligonucleotides were used in separate reactions to prime template in one direction, in combination with one of the primers that border the genomic insertion of the Lambda vector (-20 primer, and reverse primer).
      <br/>
      The PCR reaction was carried out as specified below:
      <br/>
      10  MU l 10 * Stratagene cloned Pfu buffer
      <br/>
      5  MU l degenerate p45 primer (either 743, 744, 745 or 746) at 100 ng/ MU l
      <br/>
      2.0  MU l either reverse or -20 primer (100 ng/ MU l)

      The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose, 1 * TBE, gel.

      All primer combinations produced multiple bands.

      A pattern of four bands was consistently seen with primers 743, 744, and 746 in conjunction with the -20 primer.
      <br/>
      The three degenerate primers that formed consistent four band patterns with the -20 primer were able to generate the pattern at 56 (degree)  C. Only primer 743 could generate the pattern at 58 (degree)  C. The band pattern produced with the degenerate primers in combination with the reverse primers was less distinct and formed only at lower annealing temperatures than the products generated with the -20 primer.

    <p num="132">
      Two strategies were used to isolate the P45 clone.
      <br/>
      One procedure was to make simplified sub-libraries of the original highly complex library and screen for an insert with the -20 and 743 primers.
      <br/>
      Positive sub-libraries could be diluted and rescreened until individual plaques containing the appropriate insert were identified.
      <br/>
      The other technique was to make use of Vectorette (tm)  technology (Genosys Biotechnologies), which allows PCR amplification when the sequence of only one end of a DNA fragment is known.
      <br/>
      In the vectorette system, genomic DNA is digested with a selection of specific restriction endonucleases.
      <br/>
      After digestion, the ends of the genomic DNA are ligated to specific vectorette units, which have the same cohesive termini as the genomic DNA digestion.
      <br/>
      The ligated vectorette unit contains a sequence complimentary to a provided vectorette PCR primer. (Amold and Hodgson, PCR Methods and Applications 1: 39-42 (1991).)

    <p num="133">3. The Vectorette Reaction</p>
    <p num="134">
      Fifty  MU l reactions containing 100 ng of Pfu genomic DNA were digested with Eco RI, Hind III and Bsp 106l (an isoschizomer for Cla I) in their recommended buffers for one hour at 37 (degree)  C. Without any post-reaction treatment, 1  MU l of the appropriate vectorette unit (Hind III, Cla I or Eco RI at 3 pmole/ MU l) was added with 6  MU l of 10 mM ATP, 1  MU l of 100 mM DTT and 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase (Stratagene 4 u/ MU l).
      <br/>
      The reaction was cycled at the following temperatures: 20 (degree)  C. for 60 minute followed by 37 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes for 3 cycles.

      Multiple bands were produced by all primers except 745.
      <br/>
      To determine if all three vectorette library products had been correctly primed off the same target DNA (P45 sequence) rather than having been produced by a non-specific PCR reaction, the products were digested with Mnl I. Mnl I cleaves at a frequent four base pair recognition sequence and produces a useful pattern of bands specific to the template digested.
      <br/>
      The pattern generated by electrophoresis of the Mnl I digestion fragments of the Cla I/743, Hind III/744 and Eco RI/744 PCR products on a 6% acrylamide gel showed some variation, but the majority of bands could be identified in all three samples, indicating that they share large segments of identical sequence.

      DNA Sequence Homology of Pfu P45 Protein to dCTP Deaminase
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      The partial DNA sequence of the P45 clones exhibited very strong homology to deoxycytidine triphosphate deaminase (DCD or dCTP deaminase). dCTP deaminase is a homotetramer, which catalyzes the formation of dUTP and NH3 from dCTP. dCTP deaminase has been discovered in two bacterial (E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium) and two archeal (Desulfurolobus ambivalens, Methanococcus jannaschii) species (Ouzounis, C., Kyrpides, N., and Sander, C. Nucl. Acids Res. 23:565-570 (1995); Bult, C. J. et al. Science 273:1058-1073 (1996); Beck, C. J., Eisenhardt, A. R. and Neuhard, J., J. Biol. Chem. 250:609-616 (1975)). E. coli DCD exhibits an apparent molecular weight of 21.2 kD (Wang, L. and Weiss, B. J. Bacteriol. 174:5647-5653 (1992)), while the predicted molecular weight of M. jannaschii DCD is approximately 22 kD (204 amino acids).
      <br/>
      These molecular weights are approximately half the apparent molecular weight of P. furiosus P45 and suggest that the heat-dissociated form of P45 (apparent mol. weight of 45 kD) may actually be a dimer.
    </p>

      The physiological function of dCTP deaminase has only been studied in E. coli, where it plays an essential role in deoxyribonucleotide metabolism. dCTP deaminase converts dCTP to dUTP, which is an obligatory step in the de novo synthesis of thymidylate in bacteria (Taylor, A. F., and Weiss, B. J. Bacteriol. 151:351-357 (1982)).
      <br/>
      In turn, uridine triphosphatase (dUTPase), a ubiquitous enzyme found in bacteria, eukaryotes, and eukaryotic viruses, degrades dUTP to pyrophosphate and dUMP, the thymidylate synthetase substrate.
      <br/>
      Thus, dCTP deaminase and dUTPase are functionally linked, with mutations in the dcd gene suppressing dut mutations (Wang, L. and Weiss, B. J. Bacteriol. 174: 5647-5653 (1992)).
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      dUTPase has shown to be an essential gene in E. coli and in yeast (El-Hajj, H. H., Zhang, H., and Weiss, B. J. Bacteriol. 170: 1069-1075 (1988); Gadsden, M. H., et al. EMBO J. 12:4425-4431 (1993)) because it functions in vivo to prevent dUTP incorporation into DNA.
      <br/>
      In E. coli dut mutants, the dUTP pool is greatly enhanced, resulting in an increased substitution of uracil for thymine in DNA during replication.
      <br/>
      Uracil-DNA glycosylase and exonuclease III play an essential role in repairing uracil-containing DNA in E. coli dut mutants (Taylor, A. F. and Weiss, B. J. Bacteriol. 151:351-357 (1982)).
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      The physiological role of dCTP deaminase has not been characterized in archea.
      <br/>
      The exact role of dCTP deaminase in enhancing the performance of Pfu DNA polymerase in PCR is not clear from the metabolic studies on E. coli DCD. P. furiosus DCD may be playing a role in maintaining dNTP pools during PCR.
      <br/>
      For example, DCD may convert dUTP, generated during PCR by spontaneous deamination of dCTP (Lindahl, T. and Nyberg, B., Biochem. 13: 3405-3410 (1974)), back to dCTP to maintain balanced levels of each nucleotide.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, DCD may be playing a role in repairing uracil-containing DNA.
      <br/>
      To that end, Lasken et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 271:17692-17696 (1996)) reported that archeal DNA polymerases, including Pfu DNA polymerase, tightly bind uracil-containing DNA, while pol I (Family A) DNA polymerases do not.
      <br/>
      These investigators proposed that archeal DNA polymerases may play a role in recognizing and repairing uracils in vivo.
      <br/>
      DCD may be contributing to this repair process, thereby exhibiting a physiological role unique to archeal dCTP deaminases.
    </p>
    <p num="171">
      Accordingly, P45 proteins and complexes comprising them may also be used in DNA repair reactions.
      <br/>
      In addition, P45 proteins and complexes comprising them may be used where a uridine-binding reagent can be employed.

    <p num="184">
      P. furiosus PEF has been demonstrated to enhance the yield of PCR products generated with recombinant Pfu DNA polymerase using plasmid, lambda, and genomic DNA templates (FIGS. 16-18).
      <br/>
      The results demonstrate that the addition of P. furiosus PEF increases PCR product yield for a variety of PCR systems, ranging in target complexity.
      <br/>
      Relatively easy targets, e.g. plasmid DNA, can be successfully amplified with Pfu DNA polymerase, and the addition of PEF further increases product yield (FIG. 16).
      <br/>
      Presumably, fewer PCR cycles or lower template concentrations could be used in PEF-containing amplifications.
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      The most dramatic enhancements are observed when long (FIG. 17) and/or highly complex targets (FIG. 18) are amplified.
      <br/>
      In the absence of PEF, such targets are poorly amplified by single PCR enzymes, such as Pfu DNA polymerase.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 17, the addition of 1-100 ng of PEF (S200-purified PEF; prep. 3) to 100  MU l PCR reactions containing 5 U of Pfu DNA polymerase significantly increased yields of a 10 kb PCR product.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 18, a 5.2 kb target was successfully amplified from human genomic DNA in the presence of 0.3-280 ng PEF (SCS -52 S200 purified) per 100  MU l PCR, but not in the absence of PEF, despite the use of 1.9 min. per kb extension times.
    </p>
    <p num="186">
      P. furiosus PEF has been found to enhance the yields of both specific and non-specific PCR products, when amplifications are conducted under less stringent PCR conditions with PCR primers that hybridize to more than one target. E. coli ssb (single-stranded binding protein; Stratagene's PerfectMatch) has been shown previously to increase the specificity of primer extension reactions, presumably by minimizing the formation of poorly matched primer-template complexes.
      <br/>
      When used in conjunction with E. coli ssb, P. furiosus PEF has been found to enhance the yield of specific PCR products (FIG. 19).
      <br/>
      Pfu PEF also enhances yields of PCR products obtained with exo-Pfu and a mixtures of Taq and Pfu polymerase (for example, TaqPlus Long (tm) , Stratagene; La Jolla, Calif.).
      <br/>
      Therefore, Pfu PEF is useful with polymerase mutants, truncated version of polymerases, mixtures of polymerase, and polymerase-additive combinations (for example, Perfect Match.RTM., Stratagene).

    <p num="187">2. Enhancement of Native Pfu DNA Polymerase with Pfu PEF</p>
    <p num="188">
      Subsequent to identifying PEF from P. furiosus, we recognized that certain lots of native Pfu DNA polymerase preparations contained PEF.

      Varying amounts of the &gt;250 kD aggregate could be detected on silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels (FIG. 14).
      <br/>
      Eleven of the 23 preparations examined were found to visibly contain low levels (8/11 lots; 0.1-1% total protein) to high levels (3/11 lots; 10-30% total protein) of PEF.
      <br/>
      PEF co-migrates with Pfu DNA polymerase during the initial Q- and SP-Sepharose columns in Pfu DNA polymerase purification, and elutes just after the major peak of Pfu DNA polymerase activity on the Heparin Sepharose column (FIG. 20).
      <br/>
      Pfu DNA polymerase fractions pooled after the Heparin Sepharose step are typically contaminated with varying amounts of PEF, depending upon the column efficiency and pooling strategy employed.
    </p>
    <p num="189">
      Contamination of native Pfu DNA polymerase with varying amounts of PEF could potentially contribute to lot-to-lot variation in the performance of native Pfu DNA polymerase in PCR.
      <br/>
      It is expected that lots containing approximately 1-100 ng of PEF per 2.5 U of Pfu DNA polymerase will give rise to higher PCR product yields than amplifications conducted with cloned Pfu DNA polymerase or native Pfu DNA polymerase lots contaminated with  &lt;= 10 pg per 2.5 U Pfu DNA polymerase (&lt;0.02% total protein).
      <br/>
      In theory, a lot containing certain PEF concentrations would exhibit reduced Pfu DNA polymerase performance, based upon the apparent inhibition of PEF at high concentrations discussed below (&gt;900 ng per 2.5 U Pfu DNA polymerase in 100  MU l PCRs).

      The addition of higher amounts of the column fraction (0.4-4  MU l) resulted in smearing (16-40 ng) or lack of enhancement (160 ng).
    </p>
    <p num="217">
      Inhibition of PCR enhancement at high concentrations of PEF appears to occur irrespective of the purity of the PEF sample.
      <br/>
      The addition of higher concentrations of homogeneous PEF ( &gt;= 900 ng) resulted in lower yields of PCR product than could be obtained with &lt;900 ng PEF.
      <br/>
      Heparin sepharose fractions of 10-20% purity also gave reduced PCR product yields when high amounts of PEF were added.
      <br/>
      Up to 8 ng of PEF in prep. 2 (H.S. -78 fraction) could be added before smearing or inhibition occurred.
      <br/>
      The discrepancy between the amount of PEF which is inhibitory in homogeneous preparations ( &gt;= 900 ng), as compared to partially-purified column fractions (&gt;16 ng), suggests that additional protein or DNA contaminants may be present in the heparin sepharose fractions.
      <br/>
      Examination of heparin sepharose fractions revealed that P. furiosus PEF elutes just after the major peak of Pfu DNA polymerase activity (e.g., fractions 50-61 in FIG. 20).
      <br/>
      SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the highest levels of the &gt;250 kD PEF appeared in fractions 63-78 from the SCS -36 native Pfu DNA polymerase purification (FIG. 20).
      <br/>
      PCR enhancing activity was observed in fractions 37-90 (FIG. 32).
      <br/>
      Discrete PCR product bands were generated with fractions 37-48 and 87-90, which contain very low levels of PEF.
      <br/>
      Interestingly, DNA smears were generated with fractions 69-81 (FIG. 32), which contain the highest levels of PEF and no detectable Pfu DNA polymerase.
      <br/>
      These results suggest that P. furiosus PEF may be inhibitory when present at high concentrations or, alternatively, that a contaminant co-purifies with PEF.
    </p>
    <p num="218">
      As observed with PCR, inhibition during linear amplification protocols was noted with high concentrations of PEF-containing heparin sepharose fractions.
      <br/>
      The addition of 40 ng (1  MU l prep. -2) of PEF to QuickChange (tm)  reactions resulted in reduced yield of amplification product, as visualized by a reduction in the ethidium bromide-staining intensity of DNA bands on agarose gels.
      <br/>
      Reduced yield accompanied a 1.8 to 2.8-fold reduction in the number of transformants and a slight, but reproducible, decrease in mutation frequency.
