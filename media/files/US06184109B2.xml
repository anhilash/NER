      This is a Continuation-in-Part application of U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/065,626, filed Apr. 24, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,883, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to a method of dividing a wafer and a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, and more particularly to manufacturing steps of dicing semiconductor elements formed in a wafer into chips and sealing the chips in packages, thereby miniaturizing and thinning semiconductor packages and increasing the diameter of the wafer to be used.</p>
    <p num="3">
      The manufacturing steps for semiconductor devices are generally classified into steps for patterning various semiconductor elements in a wafer (semiconductor substrate) and steps for dicing the respective semiconductor elements formed in the wafer into chips and sealing the chips in packages.
      <br/>
      Recently, the diameter of a wafer has been increased to reduce the manufacturing cost, and there has been a demand for a decrease in size and thickness of packages in order to enhance the packaging density.
      <br/>
      In the prior art, in order to seal a semiconductor chip in a thinned package, a bottom surface of a wafer, which is opposite to a pattern formation surface (major surface) of the wafer, is lapped by a grindstone and polished by free grind grains to thin the wafer prior to dicing the wafer into chips.
      <br/>
      Then, the wafer is diced.
      <br/>
      At the time of lapping, an adhesive sheet or a resist is coated to the pattern formation surface of the wafer in order to protect the pattern formation surface.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, grooves are formed in dicing line areas provided on the major surface of the wafer.
      <br/>
      These grooves are formed by means of a diamond scriber, a diamond blade, a laser scriber, etc.
      <br/>
      The dicing step is carried out by a half-cut method in which the wafer, as a single body, is diced to 1/2 of the thickness of the wafer or diced until the remaining wafer becomes about 30  MU m thick; a half-cut method in which the wafer is diced similarly, with an adhesive sheet attached to the bottom surface of the wafer; or a full-cut method in which the wafer is diced throughout the thickness thereof while the adhesive sheet is cut to a depth of 20 to 30  MU m. The half-cut method requires another dividing step.
      <br/>
      When the wafer, as a single body, is used, the wafer is sandwiched between soft films, and an external force is applied by a roller or the like, thus dividing the wafer.
      <br/>
      When the wafer is attached to the adhesive sheet, an external force is applied on the sheet, thus dividing the wafer.
      <br/>
      The divided chips are separated from the sheet in the following manner.
      <br/>
      The bottom surface of the sheet is pushed up by a pickup needle provided on a die bonding device.
      <br/>
      The needle penetrates the sheet and comes in direct contact with the bottom surface of each chip.
      <br/>
      The needle is further raised and the chip is separated from the sheet.
      <br/>
      The surface of the separated chip is held by a tool called "collet" and the chip is mounted on an island of a lead frame.
      <br/>
      Then, the pads of the chip are electrically connected to inner lead portions of the lead frame by means of wire bonding, and the chip is sealed in a package.
      <br/>
      The chip may be mounted on the island, for example, by a method in which a conductive paste is coated on the island in advance, a method in which a gold-silicon eutectic is used, or a method in which a thin film is deposited on the bottom surface of the wafer and the chip is mounted by using solder.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      FIGS. 1 to 7 illustrate in detail an example of the above-described conventional wafer dividing method and semiconductor device manufacturing method.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 illustrates a step of attaching a surface protection tape on a wafer; FIG. 2 a step of lapping and polishing the bottom surface of the wafer; FIG. 3 a step of separating the surface protection tape; FIGS. 4A and 4B steps of fixing the wafer on a fixing sheet; FIG. 5 a step of dicing the wafer; FIG. 6 a step of picking up separated chips; and FIG. 7 a die bonding step.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As is shown in FIG. 1, the bottom surface of a wafer 1 is fixed on a porous chuck table 2.
      <br/>
      By rotating and moving an attachment roller 4 in the direction indicated by the arrow, a protection tape 3 is attached on a pattern formation surface (major surface of wafer 1) 1' of the wafer 1.
      <br/>
      Various semiconductor elements are formed in the pattern formation surface 1' of wafer 1.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 2, the pattern formation surface 1', on which the protection tape 3 is attached, is situated downward and fixed on a chuck table 5.
      <br/>
      The bottom surface of the wafer 1 is lapped and polished to a predetermined thickness (i.e. a thickness of a finished chip) by means of a grindstone 6.
      <br/>
      As is shown in FIG. 3, a tape 7 for separating the protection tape 3 is attached to the protection tape 3, and the protection tape 3 is separated from the pattern formation surface 1'. A flat ring 8 is fixed on a wafer fixing sheet 9, as shown in FIG. 4A. With the slack or wrinkles of the sheet 9 removed, the wafer 1 is fixed on the sheet 9 within the opening of the flat ring 8, as shown in FIG. 4B. The sheet 9 on which the wafer 1 is fixed and the flat ring 8 are fixed on a dicing chuck table 10.
      <br/>
      The wafer 1 is diced (full-cut) by a dicing blade 11 into individual chips 12 (see FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      As is shown in FIG. 6, a pickup needle 13 is penetrated through the sheet 9 from the bottom thereof and put in contact with the bottom surface of each chip 12.
      <br/>
      The chip 12 is pushed by the needle 13 and separated from the sheet 9.
      <br/>
      The separated chip 12 is mounted on an island 14 of a lead frame, as shown in FIG. 7, by using a die bonding adhesive such as a conductive paste.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, although not shown, inner lead portions of the lead frame are wire-bonded to pads of the chip 12, and the resultant structure is sealed in a package formed of a resin or ceramic.
      <br/>
      Thus, the manufacture of a semiconductor device is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The above-described wafer dividing method and semiconductor device manufacturing method, however, have the following problems (a) to (c).</p>
    <p num="7">
      (a) The wafer tends to be broken while it is thinned by lapping.
      <br/>
      Even if the wafer is lapped with the protection tape being attached, the wafer may warp due to distortion in the lapping.
      <br/>
      As a result, the wafer may be caught during transfer within the lapping apparatus and may be broken.
      <br/>
      Since the strength of the wafer decreases as the thickness of the wafer decreases or the diameter thereof increases.
      <br/>
      If the wafer body, after it is thinned, is transferred for various processes as in the prior art, the possibility of breakage increases.
      <br/>
      For example, when the wafer is 400  MU m thick, it can withstand a load of about 1.6 Kgf/mm2. However, if the thickness is decreased to 200  MU m, the breaking strength of the wafer decreases to 1/4 or 0.4 Kgf/mm2.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      (b) Since the two sheets, one for protecting the pattern formation surface and the other for fixing the wafer at the time of dicing, are used, the attaching and separating steps for the two sheets are required.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the cost for material increases and the number of manufacturing steps also increases.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      (c) The degree of chipping on the bottom side of the wafer increases when the wafer is diced, resulting in a decrease in the breaking strength of the chip.
      <br/>
      Conventionally, transistors, resistors and capacitors for monitoring various characteristics (hereinafter referred to as "TEG" (Test Element Group)) are arranged within the chip.
      <br/>
      Recently, however, the TEG is arranged on dicing lines for the purpose of a higher integration density.
      <br/>
      As is well known, the devices of the TEG are formed of oxide films, aluminum, etc.
      <br/>
      When the devices of TEG are diced by using a diamond blade, the binding of the grindstone of the blade tends to easily occur and the cutting performance deteriorates.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the TEG is arranged on the dicing lines, the degree of chipping on the bottom side of the wafer further increases.
      <br/>
      In general, the semiconductor substrate is formed of a fragile material such as silicon or GaAs.
      <br/>
      If a crack occurs, the breaking strength of the wafer decreases.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      As has been described above, the conventional wafer dividing method and semiconductor device manufacturing method have the problem in that the wafer tends to be broken while it is being thinned by lapping or transferred.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the two sheets for protecting the pattern formation pattern and holding the wafer are required, the cost for material increases and the number of manufacturing steps increases.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the degree of chipping on the bottom side of the wafer increases when the wafer is diced, and the breaking strength of the chip decreases.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">An object of the present invention is to provide a wafer dividing method and a semiconductor device manufacturing method capable of suppressing breakage of wafers at the time of thinning wafers by lapping or transferring the wafers.</p>
    <p num="12">Another object of the invention is to provide a wafer dividing method and a semiconductor device manufacturing method capable of reducing the number of manufacturing steps and the manufacturing cost.</p>
    <p num="13">Still another object of the invention is to provide a wafer dividing method and a semiconductor device manufacturing method capable of decreasing the degree of chipping on the bottom side of wafers and preventing a decrease in breaking strength of chips.</p>
    <p num="14">The above objects can be achieved by a wafer dividing method comprising the steps of: forming grooves in a surface of a wafer, on which surface semiconductor elements are formed, along dicing lines by means of a dicing blade, the grooves being deeper than a thickness of a finished chip; attaching a holding member on the surface of the wafer on which the semiconductor elements are formed; lapping and polishing a bottom surface of the wafer to the thickness of the finished chip, thereby dividing the wafer into chips; and keeping on lapping and polishing the bottom surface of the wafer until the wafer is made to have the thickness of the finished chip, even after the wafer is divided into the chips.</p>
    <p num="15">The above objects can also be achieved by a wafer dividing method comprising the steps of: forming grooves in a surface of a wafer, on which surface semiconductor elements are formed, along chip parting lines by etching, the grooves being deeper than a thickness of a finished chip; attaching a holding member on the surface of the wafer on which the semiconductor elements are formed; lapping and polishing a bottom surface of the wafer to the thickness of the finished chip, thereby dividing the wafer into chips; and keeping on lapping and polishing the bottom surface of the wafer until the wafer is made to have the thickness of the finished chip, even after the wafer is divided into the chips.</p>
    <p num="16">
      According to this wafer dividing method, grooves, which are deeper than a thickness of a finished chip, are formed in a surface of a wafer on which surface semiconductor elements are formed, by means of a dicing blade or by utilization of etching, and a bottom surface of the wafer is lapped and polished to the thickness of the finished chip, thereby dividing the wafer into chips.
      <br/>
      Thus, chipping is prevented in the dicing step.
      <br/>
      In addition, in the case of lapping and polishing the bottom surface of the wafer to divide the wafer into the chips, if the depth of each groove is made greater than the thickness of the finished chip by at least 5  MU m, such chipping, as may occur in a region where a cutting face formed by the dicing and a polished face formed by lapping and polishing intersect with each other, can be eliminated by the lapping and polishing.
      <br/>
      The holding member may be formed of, for example, an adhesive tape, a wax, an adsorption pad, a thermocompression bonding sheet, a substrate coated with adhesive material, and a resist coated on a semiconductor element.
      <br/>
      In the step of dividing the wafer into chips, the lapping and polishing may be executed first by means of a grindstone having large-diameter grinding particles and then by means of a grindstone having small-diameter grinding particles.
      <br/>
      By executing the lapping and polishing in this manner, it is possible to save time and suppress the generation of chipping.

    <p num="19">
      According to this semiconductor device manufacturing method, the step of separating the semiconductor elements formed in the wafer into chips and sealing each chip in the package is carried out in the order of dicing (half-cut), lapping and polishing of the bottom surface of the wafer, and die bonding.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the wafer is divided into chips by the lapping and polishing.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the state in which the bottom surface of the wafer is lapped and polished and the wafer is thinned, the wafer is not transferred or processed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, breakage of the wafer can be prevented.
      <br/>
      Since the number of sheets to be used is only one, the cost for material and the number of manufacturing steps can be reduced, and the manufacturing cost can be decreased.
      <br/>
      Since there is no need to divide the wafer by applying an external force thereto, chipping can be suppressed.
      <br/>
      Since the bottom surface of the wafer is lapped and polished and the wafer is thus divided into chips, chipping on the bottom side of the wafer can be prevented, and a decrease in breaking strength can be suppressed.
      <br/>
      In the case of lapping and polishing the bottom surface of the wafer to divide the wafer into the chips, if the depth of each groove is made greater than the thickness of the finished chip by at least 5  MU m, such chipping, as may occur in a region where a cutting face formed by the dicing and a polished face formed by lapping and polishing intersect with each other, can be eliminated by the lapping and polishing.
      <br/>
      When the chip is sealed in the package, it may be sealed in an ordinary resin package, a ceramic package, or an LOC (Lead On Chip) package.
      <br/>
      A degradation due to silicon waste, which may occur in the step of lapping and polishing the bottom surface of the wafer, can be prevented if an adhesive tape thicker than the silicon waste is interposed between the major surface of the chip and the lead.
      <br/>
      In the step of dividing the wafer into chips, the lapping and polishing may be executed first by means of a grindstone having large-diameter grinding particles and then by means of a grindstone having small-diameter grinding particles.
      <br/>
      By executing the lapping and polishing in this manner, it is possible to save time and suppress the generation of chipping.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="22">
      FIGS. 8 to 13 illustrate a wafer dividing method and a semiconductor device manufacturing method according to a first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Specifically, FIG. 8 illustrates a step of forming grooves in a wafer along dicing lines; FIGS. 9A and 9B illustrate a step of attaching a surface protection tape to the wafer; FIG. 10 illustrates a step of lapping and polishing the bottom surface of the wafer (a dividing step); FIG. 11 illustrates a step of picking up separated chips; FIG. 12 illustrates a die bonding step; and FIG. 13 illustrates a step of sealing the chip in a package.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      First, as shown in FIG. 8, a wafer 21 on which various semiconductor elements are formed is fixed on a chuck table 23 of a dicing apparatus by means of a vacuum suction, etc., with a pattern formation surface (major surface of wafer 21) 21' situated upward.
      <br/>
      A dicing blade 24 is rotated at a predetermined rotational speed to cut grooves 22 along dicing lines to a predetermined depth while a cutting water being applied.
      <br/>
      The depth of each groove 22 is greater than the thickness of a finished chip by at least 5  MU m. Then, the wafer 21 is washed and dried.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The grooves 22 need not be formed in a mechanical way using the dicing blade 24 described above.
      <br/>
      They may be formed in a chemical way, such as by etching.
      <br/>
      According to one example of such a chemical way, the major surface 21' of the wafer 21 is coated with photoresist, and chip parting lines (corresponding to dicing lines) are exposed in a PEP process or the like.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the wafer 21 is immersed in a KOH solution, thereby selectively etching the wafer 21 in the depth direction thereof (i.e., in the direction perpendicular to the major surface of the wafer 21).
      <br/>
      As a result of this selective etching, grooves are formed in the wafer 21.
      <br/>
      In place of the wet etching using the KOH solution, dry etching technology, such as RIE (reactive ion etching), is applicable.
      <br/>
      For example, only the silicon can be selectively etched by using etching gases, such as an SF6 gas and a mixture gas of SF6 /CF, in a vacuum (the degree of vacuum: 60 mtorr).
      <br/>
      In particular, the use of the mixture gas of SF6 /CF enables anisotropic etching, so that grooves can be formed in the direction substantially perpendicular to the major surface 21' of the wafer 21.
      <br/>
      In comparison with the case where the dicing blade 24, such as a diamond blade, is used, the groove formation method using etching is advantageous in that the side walls of the grooves 22 (i.e., the side surfaces formed by etching) are not subjected to mechanical stress.
      <br/>
      This means that crystal defects, which are likely to be generated in side surfaces formed by cutting, can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Needless to say, the mechanical and chemical methods described above are not the only method available.
      <br/>
      For example, the grooves 22 may be formed in an optical method using a laser scriber.
      <br/>
      With respect to the step shown in FIG. 8, the method in which the grooves 22 are formed does not matter.
      <br/>
      What is important in connection therewith is that the depth of the grooves 22 is greater than the thickness of a finished chip by at least 5  MU m (the depth of the grooves 22 must not be so great as to divide the wafer 21 into chips).
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      A flat ring 25, as shown in FIG. 9A, is attached to a surface protection tape (adhesive sheet) 26 for protecting the pattern formation surface of wafer 21.
      <br/>
      With a slack or wrinkles of the tape 26 removed, a pattern formation surface 21' of the wafer 21 in which the grooves were formed in the preceding step is fixed on the adhesive side of the tape 26.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 10, the wafer 21 held by the flat ring 25 and surface protection tape 26 is fixed on a chuck table 27 of a lapping apparatus by means of a vacuum suction, etc.
      <br/>
      The bottom side of the wafer 21 is lapped while the chuck table 27 and a grindstone 28 are being rotated and the grindstone 28 is being lowered.
      <br/>
      This lapping method is generally called "in-field lapping".
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a through-field lapping method or a creep field lapping method, wherein the wafer is lapped while the wafer 21 and grindstone 28 are being rotated, may be adopted.
      <br/>
      When the bottom side of the wafer 21 has been lapped as far as the grooves 22, the wafer 21 is divided into chips 29.
      <br/>
      In this invention, the lapping is continued even after the wafer 21 has been divided into the chips 29, and the wafer is lapped by at least 5  MU m or more.
      <br/>
      Even if chipping occurs in a region where a cutting face formed by the dicing and a polished face formed by lapping and polishing intersect with each other, such chipping can be eliminated by the further lapping.
      <br/>
      If the degree of lapping and polishing is increased, a great amount of chipping can be eliminated.
      <br/>
      However, the degree of lapping/polishing may be determined on an as-need basis in accordance with the thickness of the wafer 21, the thickness of a finished chip 29, etc.
      <br/>
      The present invention can provide thin chip 29 whose thickness is within the range of 30 to 50  MU m, for example, when it is finished.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      When the bottom side of the wafer 21 is lapped as far as the grooves 22 so as to divide the wafer 21 into chips, a grindstone having grinding particles of only one kind may be used.
      <br/>
      In order to attain a short grinding time and suppress the generation of chipping, however, it is preferable to employ two kinds of grindstones having different particle diameters.
      <br/>
      In addition, the bottom side of the wafer 21 is desirably lapped in two or more steps.
      <br/>
      To be more specific, the lapping and polishing process is executed first by use of a grindstone whose grinding particles are -360 or so (the diameters of the major grinding particles are in the range of 40 to 60  MU m) and then by use of a small-particle grindstone whose grinding particles are -2000 or so (the diameters of the major grinding particles are in the range of 4 to 6  MU m).
      <br/>
      By executing the lapping and polishing process in this manner, the time required for the wafer to be divided into chips 29 can be as short as possible.
      <br/>
      In addition, the grindstone used when the wafer 21 is finally divided into chips 29 is the small-particle type.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the generation of chipping can be suppressed.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As is shown in FIG. 11, the flat ring 25 and tape 26, on which the chips 29 diced from the wafer 21 are mounted, are placed on a die bonding apparatus.
      <br/>
      A downward pressure is applied to the pattern formation surface 22 via the surface protection tape 26 by a pickup needle 30 of the die bonding apparatus.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the pickup needle 30 pushes the pattern formation surface of the chip 29, without penetrating the tape 26, and the chip 29 is separated from the tape 26.
      <br/>
      The inventors confirmed that when the radius of curvature of the tip portion of the pickup needle 30 was 0.35 mm or more, no damage was caused on aluminum wiring, etc. in the chip 29 even when a force of 18 N was applied (in the case of a chip with a size of 15 mm * 15 mm).
      <br/>
      Thus, even if the pickup needle 30 (metallic pin) pushes the major surface of chip 29 with the surface protection tape 26 interposed, the pickup needle 30 does not break the tape 26 if the radius of curvature of the tip portion of the pickup needle 30 is optimized, and there arises no problem.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, when the chip 29 is separated from the tape 26, the chip 29 is pushed down.
      <br/>
      However, the chip 29 may be pushed up, as is widely adopted in the field of the art.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The chip 29 separated from the tape 26 is held by a tool called "collet" of the die bonding apparatus and mounted on an island 31 of a lead frame, as shown in FIG. 12. In this case, a conductive paste 32 for fixing is coated on the island 31 of the lead frame in advance, and the chip 29 is die-bonded on the island 31.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the chip 29 may be mounted by using a gold-silicon eutectic, or by depositing a metal thin film on the bottom side of the wafer and using solder.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Thereafter, the pads of the chip 29 are electrically connected to the inner lead portions of the lead frame 34 by means of bonding wires 35 in a wire bonding step.
      <br/>
      The chip 29, island 31 and inner lead portions of lead frame 34 are sealed in a package 33 of a resin (or ceramic).
      <br/>
      Then, lead forming is performed and a semiconductor device, as shown in FIG. 13, is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      FIGS. 14A and 14B are enlarged views of lapped faces of chips diced from the wafer.
      <br/>
      FIG. 14A is an enlarged view of lapped faces formed by full-cut dicing according to the conventional dividing method and manufacturing method.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 14A, a great number of chippings occur in the diced region.
      <br/>
      FIG. 14B shows the case of the dividing method and manufacturing method according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      As compared to FIG. 14A, the diced faces are sharp and the degree of chipping is greatly reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In the first embodiment described above, grooves 22 are first formed in the wafer 21 in the step shown in FIG. 8, and a flat ring 25 is then attached to the surface protection tape 26 on the pattern formation surface, as shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B. The wafer 21, which is then held by the flat ring 25 and the surface protection tape 26, is fixed on the chuck table 27 of the lapping apparatus by vacuum suction, and in this state the bottom surface of the wafer 21 is lapped and polished.
      <br/>
      It should be noted, however, that the flat ring 25 is not necessarily required in the step of lapping and polishing the bottom surface of the wafer 21.
      <br/>
      That is, the flat ring can be omitted, as can be seen from FIGS. 15 and 16. More specifically, grooves 22 are first formed in the wafer 21 in such a step as is shown in FIG. 8, and then a surface protection tape (an adhesive sheet) 52 is attached to the pattern formation surface (major surface) 21' of the wafer 21 by moving the roller 51 in the direction indicated by the arrow in FIG. 15. Subsequently, the wafer 21, the major surface of which is protected by the surface protection tape 52, is fixed on the chuck table 27 of the lapping apparatus by vacuum suction or the like, as shown in FIG. 16. Since a flat ring is not used, the entirety of the wafer 21 has to be sucked in a "flat" state.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the chuck table 27 and the grindstone 28 are rotated, and the bottom surface of the wafer 21 is lapped by moving the grindstone 28 downward.
      <br/>
      When the bottom surface of the wafer 21 has been lapped to the grooves 22, the wafer 21 is divided into chips.
      <br/>
      Even after the wafer 21 is divided into chips 29, the lapping and polishing process is continued until the wafer is lapped by at least 5  MU m or more.
      <br/>
      Then, as shown in FIG. 17A, the bottom surface of the wafer 21, which is divided into chips 29 in the preceding step but is held to be a one body by the surface protection tape 52, is attached to the adhesive sheet 26 of the flat ring 25.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the surface protection tape 52 is separated from the wafer 21, as shown in FIG. 17B. The subsequent steps are similar to those shown in FIGS. 11 to 13. The chips 29 that are picked up in the step shown in FIG. 11 need not be immediately subjected to a die bonding step, a wire bonding step, a packaging step, etc. so as to complete the fabrication of a semiconductor device.
      <br/>
      Instead of those steps, the picked-up chips 29 may be packed on a tray.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 18 illustrates a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to a second embodiment of the present invention, wherein the invention is applied to an LOC (Lead On Chip) package.
      <br/>
      In the case of an LOC package, the chip that is picked up, as shown in FIG. 11, is sealed in the following manner.
      <br/>
      An adhesive tape 36 is provided on the chip 29, and one end portion of a lead 37 is attached to the adhesive tape 36.
      <br/>
      Then, each pad of the chip 29 and the associated lead 37 are electrically connected by means of a bonding wire 35 in a wire bonding process.
      <br/>
      The resultant structure is sealed in a resin package 33 or a ceramic package.
      <br/>
      Thus, a semiconductor device as shown in FIG. 18 is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In this case, if silicon waste is present on the chip 29, it may break the surface protection film of the chip due to a load at the time of adhesion of the lead 37 or wire bonding.
      <br/>
      As a result, breakage of aluminum wiring or short-circuit may be caused.
      <br/>
      To solve this problem, the adhesive tape 36 is made thicker than the silicon waste.

      As is shown in Table 1, in the prior art, the breakage ratio increases as the chip thickness decreases.
      <br/>
      By contrast, in the present invention, the breakage ratio decreases as the final chip thickness decreases.
      <br/>
      The reason is that if the chip thickness is decreased, the depth of the groove can be reduced, and therefore the wafer thickness below the groove can be increased.
      <br/>
      In the case of the wafer with the diameter of 6 inches, the thickness of the wafer is generally 600 to 650  MU m. In the conventional dividing method and manufacturing method, when a chip with a thickness of, e.g. 50  MU m is to be formed, the wafer is lapped and polished in advance to a thickness of 50  MU m, and the process illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 3 is performed.
      <br/>
      By contrast, in the method of the present invention, after the grooves of 50  MU m in depth are formed (the wafer portion of 550 to 600  MU m remains below each groove), the wafer is lapped and polished and thus divided into chips.
      <br/>
      Thus, the breakage ratio in the present invention decreases.

      (2) Troubles at the time of transfer do not depend on the diameter of the wafer.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, the wafer is divided into chips simultaneously with the lapping process.
      <br/>
      Even if the chip is thin, or even if the diameter of the wafer is unchanged, the wafer can be transferred within the apparatus without influence of warp of the wafer due to dicing distortion.
      <br/>
      In addition, if the chip thickness is decreased, the wafer portion below the grooves is made thicker.
      <br/>
      From this point, too, the breakage ratio of wafers at the time of transfer can be decreased.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the advantage as shown in Table 2 below can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In this case, the diameter of the wafer is 8 inches, and the thickness of a finished chip is 50  MU m.

      As is clear from data on Table 2, the present invention is advantageous in the use of wafers with greater diameters.
      <br/>
      This invention is easily applied to 12-inch wafers or 16-inch wafers which will be used in future.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      (3) Since only one surface protection tape is used, the cost for material and processing can be reduced by 60%, as compared to the conventional method.
      <br/>
      Thus, the manufacturing cost can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      (4) In the case of the full-cut method, not only the wafer but also the sheet is cut.
      <br/>
      As a result, the cutting performance of the blade deteriorates and cutting waste flies during the dicing step.
      <br/>
      In general, the dicing speed in the full-cut method is 80 to 120 mm/sec.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the dicing speed can be increased up to 200 mm/sec.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the dicing speed can be increased, and the processing cost can be reduced by about 10%.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      (5) In order to divide the wafer, there is no need to perform cutting as deep as the dicing sheet.
      <br/>
      In addition, the grindstone for lapping the bottom surface of the wafer is used to divide the wafer.
      <br/>
      Thus, the size of chipping on the bottom surface decreases from about 15  MU m, as in the prior art, to about 4  MU m. Furthermore, the breaking strength is increased from 520 MPa, as in the prior art, up to 600 MPa.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Where a wafer is divided into chips by the lapping and polishing of the bottom surface of the wafer, the amount of chipping generated from the bottom surface varies, depending upon the diameters of the grinding diamond particles of the grindstone used.
      <br/>
      As can be seen from Table 3 below, when the diameters of the diamond particles are small, the amount of chipping generated from the bottom surface of the wafer is small, and the breaking strength of the chips is improved.
      <br/>
      This being so, the diamond particle diameters of the grindstone used for dividing a wafer into chips should be as small as possible.
      <br/>
      As described above, where a grindstone having large-diameter grinding particles and a grindstone having small-diameter grinding particles are used in combination, the generation of chipping can be reduced, and yet the time required for lapping and polishing the wafer can be as short as possible.

      <br/>
      As is clear from FIG. 19, in the separating method of the present invention, as compared to the separating method in the prior art, the probability of occurrence of chipping decreases if the breaking strength is unchanged.

      That is, the breaking strength is increased.

      (6) In order to divide the wafer, there is no need to perform cutting as deep as the dicing sheet.
      <br/>
      Thus, the wear of the dicing blade is reduced, and the life of the dicing blade can be increased.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case of the method in which cutting is performed as deep as the dicing sheet, the life of the blade is normally 10000 to 20000 lines (in the case of a 6-inch wafer).
