    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The entry of excessive amounts of calcium ions into neurons following an ischemic episode or other neuronal trauma has been well documented.
      <br/>
      Uncontrolled high concentrations of calcium in neurons initiate a cascade of biochemical events that disrupts normal cellular processes.
      <br/>
      Among these events are the activation of proteases and lipases, the breakdown of neuronal membranes, and the formation of free radicals, which may ultimately lead to cell death.
      <br/>
      Several types of calcium channels, the L, N, P, Q, R, and T types, have been discovered.
      <br/>
      Each type possesses distinct structural features, functional properties and cellular/subcellular distributions.
      <br/>
      Type-selective calcium channel blockers also have been identified.
      <br/>
      For example, SNX-111 has been shown to be a selective N-type calcium channel blocker and has demonstrated activity in a number of models of ischemia and pain (Bowersox S. S., et al., Drug News and Perspective, 1994:7:261-268 and references cited therein).
      <br/>
      The compounds of the present invention are calcium channel blockers that can block N-type calcium channels and can be used to treat stroke, pain, cerebral ischemia, head trauma, and epilepsy.

    <p num="126">
      The compounds of the present invention exhibit valuable biological properties because of their ability to block calcium flux through N-type voltage-gated calcium channels.
      <br/>
      In addition to their ability to block N-type Ca2+ channels, the compounds of the present invention were also evaluated for their ability to inhibit calcium flux through L-type Ca2+ channels and Na and K channels in superior cervical ganglia (SCG) neurons.
      <br/>
      To measure interaction at the N-type Ca2+ channel and calcium flux inhibition, the effects of the compounds of the present invention were measured in the assays described below.
    </p>
    <p num="127">Measurement of N-type Ca2+ Channel Blocking Potencies of Compounds in IMR-32 Cells Using the Fluorescent Ca2+ Indicator Indo-1</p>
    <p num="128">
      IMR-32 cells are a human tumoral cell line of neural origin.
      <br/>
      The IMR-32 cell line has been shown to contain both N- and L-type voltage sensitive calcium channels.
      <br/>
      Calcium flux into these cells may be induced by stimulation with elevated potassium concentrations.
      <br/>
      The L-channel component of calcium flux may be blocked by adding 5  MU M nitrendipine.
      <br/>
      The remaining component of calcium entry into the IMR-32 cells is due to calcium flux through N-type calcium channels.
      <br/>
      Intracellular calcium concentrations are measured using the fluorescent calcium indicator Indo-1.
      <br/>
      The effect of drug concentration on calcium uptake is studied.
    </p>
    <p num="129">Methods</p>
    <p num="130">
      The IMR-32 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.).
      <br/>
      Cells were grown in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-Gln and antibiotic/antimicotic mixture (Gibco).
      <br/>
      At approximately 80% confluency, differentiation was induced by the addition of 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP and 2.5  MU M bromodeoxyuridine to the medium.
      <br/>
      After 7 to 13 days of differentiation, cells were detached using 0.5 mM EDTA and loaded with 5  MU M Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) at 300 (degree)  C. for 45 minutes.
      <br/>
      Loaded cells were washed twice, resuspended (.about.107 cells/mL) in assay buffer (10 mM HEPES/Tris pH 7.4 in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution without bicarbonate or phenol red containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and kept on ice until use.
      <br/>
      Fluorescence measurements were carried out in a Photon Technology International (PTI, South Brunswick, N.J.) Model RF-F3004 spectrofluorometer with dual emission monochromators using excitation at 350 nm and emission at 400 and 490 nm.
      <br/>
      The instrument was equipped with a thermostated cuvette holder with stirring capabilities, as well as with a computer-controlled pump that allowed for reagent addition during measurement.
      <br/>
      Instrument control and data collection was done by PTI's OSCAR software running on an IBM compatible computer.
      <br/>
      Different concentrations of the test compounds (60  MU L in dimethyl sulfoxide) were added to 5.94 mL of assay buffer containing approximately 3 * 106 loaded cells, and 5  MU M Nitrendipine (in 30  MU L EtOH) to block L-type Ca2+ channels.
      <br/>
      Samples were incubated for 10 minutes at 30 (degree)  C. and then aliquoted into three 10 * 10 mm disposable acrylic cuvettes.
      <br/>
      Emission signals at 400 and 490 nm were acquired from each cuvette at 30 (degree)  C. for 50 seconds.
      <br/>
      At 20 seconds after the start of reading, cells were depolarized by the addition of 160  MU L of stimulation solution (1 M KCl, 68 mM CaCl2) to the cuvette via the computer-controlled pump.
      <br/>
      Ratio of dual emission signals (400 nm/490 nm), which is proportional to intracellular Ca2+ concentration, was plotted against time, and the difference between maximal response after stimulation and basal value (before stimulation) was determined.
      <br/>
      Values obtained in this way were plotted as a function of drug concentration.
      <br/>
      IC50 values of test compounds were calculated by fitting a four-parameter logistic function to the data using the least squared method.
      <br/>
      The results are presented in Table 1.

      Substances were administered by intravenous injection into the retro-orbital venous sinus.
      <br/>
      All testing was performed 15 minutes or 45 minutes after drug injection.
      <br/>
      All the male mice, 3 to 4 weeks old, were obtained from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbour, Me.
      <br/>
      Immediately before anticonvulsant testing, mice were placed upon a wire mesh, 4 inches square suspended from a steel rod.
      <br/>
      The square was slowly inverted through 180 degrees, and the mice were observed for 30 seconds.
      <br/>
      Any mouse falling from the wire mesh was scored as ataxic.

      Mice were placed into an enclosed acrylic plastic chamber (21 cm height, approximately 30 cm diameter) with a high-frequency speaker (4 cm diameter) in the center of the top lid.

      An audio signal generator (Protek model B-810) was used to produce a continuous sinusoidal tone that was swept linearly in frequency between 8 kHz and 16 kHz once each 10 msec.
      <br/>
      The average sound pressure level (SPL) during stimulation was approximately 100 dB at the floor of the chamber.
      <br/>
      Mice were placed within the chamber and allowed to acclimatize for 1 minute.
      <br/>
      DBA/2 mice in the vehicle-treated group responded to the sound stimulus (applied until tonic extension occurred, or for a maximum of 60 seconds) with a characteristic seizure sequence consisting of wild running followed by clonic seizures, and later by tonic extension, and finally by respiratory arrest and death in 80% or more of the mice.
      <br/>
      In vehicle-treated mice, the entire sequence of seizures to respiratory arrest lasts approximately 15 to 20 seconds.
