      No. 08/956,027 filed Oct. 22, 1997, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,117,629.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a spectrally sensitized silver halide photographic emulsion and a method for producing the same and, further, relates to a silver halide photographic material containing said emulsion.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">The sensitivity of a silver halide photographic material is determined by the light absorption factor of a grain, latent image forming efficiency including spectral sensitization efficiency and a minimum size of a latent image.</p>
    <p num="4">Of these factors, as to techniques of improving the light absorption factor of a grain, some which are known heretofore are shown below.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Techniques of high aspect ratio tabular grain emulsions disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,789, etc., are techniques capable of increasing a dye adsorption amount per one grain because a tabular grain has a larger grain surface area, as a result, the light absorption factor can be improved.
      <br/>
      However, there are limitations in the increase of the surface area of a grain by heightening an aspect ratio and the like, therefore, a larger sized grain is necessary to improve the light absorption factor of one grain.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In addition to the above, as methods of increasing the grain surface area per one grain, methods of making a pore at a part of a grain are disclosed in JP-A-58-106532 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") and JP-A-60-221320, and a ruffled grain is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,643,966. However, the forms of grains according to these methods are unstable and accompanied by extreme difficulties in practical use.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Further, U.S. Pat. No. 5,302,499 discloses that a light absorption factor can be improved by constituting the layer structure having spectral sensitization characteristics and optimal grain thicknesses.
      <br/>
      But the improvement of a light absorption factor by the optimization of the grain thicknesses is at most 10% or so.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Accordingly, for markedly improving a light absorption factor of one grain while maintaining a grain size small with a stable grain form, it is necessary to improve the light absorption factor per unit surface area of a grain.
      <br/>
      For that sake, it is necessary to heighten the adsorption density of a sensitizing dye, but a generally used spectral sensitizing dye is adsorbed onto a monolayer with almost the closest charging and is adsorbed no more.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Methods which have been proposed for a sensitizing dye to be multilayer adsorbed onto a grain surface are shown below.</p>
    <p num="10">In P. B. Gilman, Jr., et al., Photoarachic Science and Engineering, Vol. 20, No. 3, p. 97 (1976), a cationic dye is adsorbed onto the first layer and an anionic dye is adsorbed onto the second layer using electrostatic power.</p>
    <p num="11">Further, G. B. Bird, et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 3,622,316, a plurality of dyes are multilayer adsorbed onto silver halide and sensitized by Forster type excitation energy transfer.</p>
    <p num="12">However, even these above-described methods could not sufficiently improve the light absorption factor per unit surface area of a silver halide grain, therefore, a further technical development has been required.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <p num="25">A sensitizing dye can be multilayer adsorbed onto the surface of a silver halide grain according to the above method, and light absorption strength by a sensitizing dye per unit area of a silver halide grain surface can be made 100 or more, only when a grain has a spectral absorption maximum wavelength of 500 nm or less, light absorption strength of 60 or more. "Light absorption strength" in the above (1) and (3) means the light absorption strength per unit surface area by a sensitizing dye except for absorption by a silver halide grain. "The light absorption strength per unit surface area by a sensitizing dye" used herein is defined as the value obtained by integrating optical density Log (Io /(Io -I)) to wave number (cm-1), taking the light amount incident on the unit surface area of a grain as I0 and the light amount absorbed by the sensitizing dye at said surface as I, and the integrated range is from 5,000 cm-1 to 35,000 cm-1.</p>

    </p>
    <p num="27">According to the kinds of photographic materials, as it is required to have strong absorption in a narrower wave number range, it is more preferred to select the kinds of dyes so as to 90% or more of light absorption strength is concentrated within the integrated range of from  * cm- to x+5,000 cm-1 (where x is the value to make the above range of light absorption strength maximum, 5,000 cm-1 &lt;x&lt;30,000 cm-1).</p>

    <p num="95">
      In the present invention, various known methods can be used to incorporate the above couplers into a light-sensitive layer.
      <br/>
      In general, an oil-in-water dispersing method known as an oil-protect method is effectively used for the addition.
      <br/>
      That is, the coupler is dissolved in a solvent, then dispersed in an aqueous solution of gelatin containing a surfactant.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, couplers may be added as oil-in-water dispersion accompanied by phase inversion by adding water or an aqueous solution of gelatin to a coupler solution containing a surfactant.
      <br/>
      In addition, alkali-soluble couplers can be dispersed according to a so-called Fischer dispersing method.
      <br/>
      After a low boiling point organic solvent is removed from the coupler dispersion by distillation, noodle washing or ultrafiltration, couplers may be mixed with a photographic emulsion.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      As a dispersion medium of couplers, it is preferred to use a high boiling point organic solvent having a dielectric constant of from 2 to 20 at 25 (degree)  C. and a refractive index of from 1.5 to 1.7 at 25 (degree)  C. and/or a water-insoluble high molecular compound.

      Compounds which have a melting point of 100 (degree)  C. or less, a boiling point of 140 (degree)  C. or more, immiscible with water, and a good solvent to couplers can be used.
      <br/>
      A melting point of a high boiling point organic solvent is preferably 80 (degree)  C. or less and a boiling point is preferably 160 (degree)  C. or more, more preferably 170 (degree)  C. or more.
    </p>
    <p num="97">These high boiling point organic solvents are disclosed in detail in JP-A-62-215272, p. 137 right lower column to p. 144, right upper column.</p>

      <br/>
      For that sake, dyes are included in colloid layers in a nondiffusible state and used so as to be decolored during the course of development processing.

      The evaluation of the adsorption amount of a sensitizing dye onto emulsion grains was conducted using the following two methods in combination, that is, one method in which the adsorbed dye amount was obtained by centrifuging the emulsion on which a dye was adsorbed to separate into emulsion grains and a supernatant aqueous gelatin solution, and subtracting the dye density not adsorbed, which was obtained from the spectral absorption measurement of the supernatant, from the addition amount of the dye, another method in which the adsorbed dye amount was obtained by drying precipitated emulsion grains, dissolving a certain weight of precipitate in a mixed solution of an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate and methanol in a ratio of 1/1, and conducting spectral absorption measurement.
      <br/>
      With respect to the method of obtaining the adsorption amount of a dye by measuring the dye amount in a supernatant, W. West, et al., Journal of Physical Chemistry, Vol. 56, p. 1054 (1952) can be referred to.
      <br/>
      When a dye was added in quantities, the dye not adsorbed sometimes precipitated, therefore, in some cases, the exact adsorbed dye amount could not necessarily be obtained by the method of measuring the dye density in a supernatant.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, it was found that according to the method of dissolving the precipitated silver halide grains and measuring the adsorption amount of a dye, as the precipitating rate of emulsion grains was overwhelmingly rapid, grains and precipitated dye could be easily separated and the dye amount adsorbed onto the grains could be exactly measured.

      The light absorption strength per unit area of a grain surface can be obtained using a microspectrophotometer.
      <br/>
      A microspectrophotometer is a device which can measure the absorption spectrum of a minute area and the transmission spectrum of one grain can be measured.
      <br/>
      With respect to the measurement of the absorption spectrum of one grain by a microspectral method, Yamashita, et al., A Summary of Lectures of Annual Meeting of Nihon Shashin Gakkai, 1996, p. 15 can be referred to.
      <br/>
      The light absorption strength per one grain can be found from this absorption spectrum, but as the light transmitted through a grain is absorbed at two faces of upper and lower faces, the light absorption strength per unit area of a grain surface can be searched for as one half of the light absorption strength per one grain obtained by the above method.

    <p num="152">Preparation of Silver Iodobromide Cubic Emulsion</p>
    <p num="153">One thousand (1,000) ml of water, 25 g of deionized ossein gelatin, 15 ml of a 50% aqueous solution of NH4 NO3, and 7.5 ml of a 25% aqueous solution of NH3 were put in a reaction vessel and stirred thoroughly, while maintaining the temperature at 50 (degree)  C., then 750 ml of an aqueous solution of 1N silver nitrate and an aqueous solution containing 1 mol/liter of potassium bromide and 0.05 mol/liter of potassium iodide were added over 50 minutes with maintaining the silver potential during reaction of +50 mv to a saturated calomel electrode.</p>
    <p num="154">
      The thus-obtained silver iodobromide grains were cubic having a side length of 0.78.+- 0 (slashed zero) 06  MU m. The temperature of the above emulsion was lowered, a copolymer of isobutene and monosodium maleate was added thereto as a coagulant, the precipitate was washed with water and desalted.
      <br/>
      In the next place, 95 g of deionized ossein gelatin and 430 ml of water were added and pH and pAg were adjusted to 6.5 and 8.3, respectively, at 50 (degree)  C. Subsequently, sodium thiosulfate was added and ripening was carried out over 50 minutes at 55 (degree)  C. to obtain optimal sensitivity.
      <br/>
      One (1) kg of this emulsion contained 0.74 mol of silver bromide.
      <br/>
      This emulsion was designated Emulsion C.
    </p>
    <p num="155">Emulsion C was weighed each in 50 g portion and, with maintaining the temperature at 50 (degree)  C., the mixture of the first dyes shown in Table 4 below was added to each emulsion and stirred at 60 (degree)  C. for 10 minutes, then, the mixture of the second dyes was added and stirred for further 30 minutes at 60 (degree)  C., thereafter each emulsion was coated as described below.</p>
    <p num="156">The coating amount of silver was 2.5 g/m2 , and the coating amount of gelatin was 3.8 g/m2. An aqueous solution comprising as main components 0.22 g/liter of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, 0.50 g/liter of sodium p-sulfostyrene homopolymer, 3.1 g/liter of sodium 2,4-chloro-6-hydroxy-1,3,5-triazine, and 50 g/liter of gelatin was coated as an upper layer by a double extrusion method such that the coating amount of gelatin became 1.0 g/m2.</p>
    <p num="157">
      Measurement of the dye adsorption amount, exposure and development were conducted in the same manner as in Example 1.
      <br/>
      Optical density of the development processed film was measured using a Fuji automatic densitometer.
      <br/>
      Sensitivity was a reciprocal of exposure amount required to give an optical density of fog+0.2 and expressed as a relative value taking Comparison 1 as a control, with fog being the density at the unexposed part.

      The dye adsorption amount and the light absorption strength per unit surface area are shown in Table 8 and sensitivity in Table 9 below.

      Thus, the adsorption amount of sensitizing dyes could be increased using the dye addition method according to the present invention, and the light absorption strength per unit surface area could also be improved.
      <br/>
      Further, as chemical sensitization was conducted when the optimal amount of a dye was added, the site of a chemical sensitization speck was limited and intrinsic sensitivity could also be increased.

    <p num="215">The light absorption strength of the obtained emulsions was searched for in the same manner as in Example 1.</p>
    <p num="216">
      Coated samples were prepared in the same manner as the preparation of the coated samples in the example of European Patent 0699950, and a sample in which Emulsion 11A was used was named Sample No. 1101, 11B was named Sample No. 1102, 11C was named Sample No. 1103, and 11D was used was named Sample No. 1104. Exposure and development were conducted in the same manner as in European Patent 0699950 and photographic characteristics were prepared.
      <br/>
      Sensitivity was a reciprocal of exposure amount required to give a density of fog+0.2 and expressed as a relative value taking the sensitivity of Sample No. 1101 as a control.
