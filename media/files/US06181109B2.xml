    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to electrical batteries, and in particular, a method and apparatus for monitoring and maintaining batteries.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      A battery is a device that converts the chemical energy contained in its active materials directly into electrical energy by means of an oxidation-reduction electrochemical reaction.
      <br/>
      This type of reaction involves the transfer of electrons from one material to another.
      <br/>
      Batteries in the art commonly utilize electrochemical operations to store and release electrical energy.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      FIG. 1 illustrates the electrochemical operation of a typical battery.
      <br/>
      Referring to the figure, the negative electrode (anode 2) is the component capable of giving up electrons, being oxidized during the reaction.
      <br/>
      It is separated from the oxidizing material, which is the positive electrode (cathode 1), the component capable of accepting electrons.
      <br/>
      The transfer of electrons takes place in the external electric circuit 11 which connects the two materials 1, 2 while the electrolyte 3 provides an ionic medium for the electron transfer in the battery 4.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Because of the electrochemical nature of batteries, they are degradable products and deteriorate as a result of chemical actions that proceed during storage.
      <br/>
      Proper maintenance is critical to the operation and functional stability of batteries.
      <br/>
      There is a general need in the art for maximizing the functional stability of batteries by optimally storing and maintaining batteries.
      <br/>
      The present invention satisfies this need and others.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The invention provides a method and apparatus by which the operational characteristics of individual batteries are diagnosed.
      <br/>
      In a first preferred embodiment, a two-part method for maintaining a plurality of batteries is provided.
      <br/>
      The method comprises a first part of a normal analysis and a second part of a more detailed analysis.
      <br/>
      Initially, conditions of the batteries are monitored.
      <br/>
      The normal analysis is performed on the batteries using the battery conditions monitored.
      <br/>
      As a result of the normal analysis, the battery detected as marginal is selected.
      <br/>
      In the second part of the method, additional battery parameters of the marginal battery are measured.
      <br/>
      The detailed analysis is performed on the marginal battery using the additional battery parameters measured.
      <br/>
      According to the results of the detailed analysis, the marginal battery is then flagged for service.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      According to a specific embodiment of the invention, a plurality of main batteries and a corresponding plurality of auxiliary batteries are maintained.
      <br/>
      A normal analysis is performed to determine if any one of the main batteries in the battery system is marginal.
      <br/>
      The marginal battery is disconnected and a corresponding auxiliary battery is switched on.
      <br/>
      A detailed analysis is then performed on the marginal battery.
      <br/>
      The marginal battery is serviced according to the results of the detailed analysis and is available for use in the battery system.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="9">
      FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating the method of the invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 2, battery conditions of all of the batteries are monitored in Step 21, including conditions from which a determination can be made whether a particular battery is marginal.
      <br/>
      A normal analysis is performed on all the batteries (Step 22).
      <br/>
      A "normal analysis" monitors sufficient battery conditions to determine whether a battery is marginal.
      <br/>
      A "marginal" battery has conditions outside of a prescribed range of suitable values for the intended purpose of the battery.
      <br/>
      Step 23 determines whether any one of the batteries is marginal.
      <br/>
      If none of the batteries has marginal battery conditions, then the control flow is reverted to Step 21 and the conditions of the batteries continue to be monitored.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      On the other hand, if a battery is determined to be marginal, additional battery parameters of the marginal battery are measured (Step 24) for use in a detailed analysis of that battery (Step 25).
      <br/>
      Among the additional battery parameters that are measured are the state of charge, electrolyte level, terminal resistance, and battery capacity.
      <br/>
      The detailed analysis includes analyzing the battery parameters measured to determine the actions required to service the marginal battery.
      <br/>
      The marginal battery then can be serviced according to the results of the detailed analysis (Step 26).
      <br/>
      The purpose of the battery servicing is to ensure that the battery operates above marginal condition.
      <br/>
      In the meantime, the conditions of all the batteries are continuously monitored.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The invention provides a two-part method for maintaining the plurality of batteries comprising a normal analysis followed by a detailed analysis, if necessary.
      <br/>
      The normal analysis is applied to all batteries during normal operation of the battery system.
      <br/>
      The detailed analysis is selectively performed on specific batteries based on the results of the normal analysis.
      <br/>
      Upon detection of marginal batteries among the plurality of batteries, the detailed analysis is performed on the marginal batteries individually.
      <br/>
      The detailed analysis can also be performed offline or during system down time.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      FIGS. 2A and 2B are flow diagrams illustrating a preferred embodiment of the method of the invention.
      <br/>
      The steps taken to perform the normal analysis and the detailed analysis can be implemented in hardware or software.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Referring to FIG. 2A, some battery conditions, such as voltage, current and temperature conditions, are monitored for each of the plurality of batteries in Step 221 while others are derived from such measurements.
      <br/>
      The normal analysis on such battery conditions is performed at Step 223 and includes an analysis of:

      Using the measured voltage, current and temperature data, the internal resistance (IR) and the state of charge (SOC) of a battery can be determined as part of the normal analysis of Step 223.
      <br/>
      A battery is deemed marginal if any one of its voltage, current and temperature measurements significantly deviates from a prescribed range and/or the rest of the batteries.
      <br/>
      A battery is also deemed marginal if it has faulty conditions, such as a low SOC or high IR (Step 225).
      <br/>
      Adjustment can then be made with respect to any marginal battery at Step 228.
      <br/>
      Any marginal batteries are reported (Step 227) and actions are recommended for the affected battery (Step 229).
      <br/>
      For example, if a low SOC is detected, which is considered a faulty condition, the low SOC level is reported (Step 227).
      <br/>
      An action to remedy the low SOC, such as increasing the voltage charge supplied to the marginal battery, or performing a detailed analysis on the marginal battery (Step A), can be recommended (Step 229).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Faulty conditions of the batteries can also be anticipated at Step 225 before they occur.
      <br/>
      The occurrence and timing of a faulty condition are anticipated by determinations that are made during the course of the normal analysis.
      <br/>
      For example, a maximum IR limit can be set for each battery and its occurrence anticipated based on the voltage, current and temperature measurements for that battery.
      <br/>
      In particular, the IR is computed as the measured voltage divided by the measured current and this value can be plotted against the temperature.
      <br/>
      See FIG. 2C. Preferably, the maximum IR limit is set as one the fault conditions to be detected at Step 225.
      <br/>
      If no fault condition is detected, then the maximum IR limit optionally can be adjusted at Step 228 in view of the voltage, current and temperature measurements of the normal analysis of Step 223.
      <br/>
      In the meantime, battery conditions of all of the batteries are continuously monitored.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In a specific embodiment, a plurality of batteries is monitored and each one's IR is determined.
      <br/>
      Measurements are made at predetermined intervals by monitoring the voltage, current and temperature conditions for each battery.
      <br/>
      The IR and SOC of each battery, together with the temperature, are then used to determine whether the battery condition is marginal or not.
      <br/>
      The IR is calculated at a given temperature based on these data, and the basic IR vs. temperature curve can be reconstructed based on calculated IR over the temperature range for the present SOC of the battery.
      <br/>
      Once the IR vs. temperature curve is obtained from the measured data it is compared with a standard curve of IR vs. temperature based on the requirements of the system.
      <br/>
      Using this IR limit analysis, battery useful life can be predicted at Step 225 and servicing actions anticipated and reported at Step 227.

    <p num="19">
      FIG. 2C depicts the battery IR and the maximum allowable limit of IR as a function of temperature for a typical battery.
      <br/>
      Such a graph is found in the specifications of most commercially available batteries.
      <br/>
      The measured IR of a given battery is compared with the maximum allowed by the IR limit curve for that battery or battery type.
      <br/>
      Based on the temperature conditions being monitored, extrapolations can be made for both the ambient temperature and IR so that the time when a battery will exceed its IR limit can be anticipated.
      <br/>
      Based on the anticipated information, operational time periods can be anticipated and offline times can be scheduled for individual batteries for servicing.
      <br/>
      Adjustments are made according to the forecast information at Step 228 of FIG. 2A. Meanwhile, the conditions of all the batteries are monitored on a continuous basis.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Once a marginal battery has been detected, the detailed analysis is performed, as described next.
      <br/>
      The process of FIG. 2B flows from Step 229 of FIG. 2A. At Step 231, a load is applied to the marginal battery so that additional battery parameters can be measured at Step 233 for the marginal battery.
      <br/>
      The additional battery parameters include the SOC, electrolyte level, terminal resistance, and battery capacity.
      <br/>
      The additional battery parameters are used in the detailed analysis step, Step 235, to determine the following:
      <br/>
      (1) Mismatched cells, e.g., individual cells within the battery that may be at different capacity levels;
      <br/>
      (3) Soft-shorted cells, often found in lead-acid batteries, where the shorted cell behaves like a normal cell with low capacity during charge, but becomes a dead cell and loses voltage during discharge and in long open circuit periods;
      <br/>
      (4) Reverse connections (during initial installations), where the positive terminal of a battery is connected to a negative terminal of the charger, and the negative terminal of the battery is connected to the positive terminal of the charger;
      <br/>
      (5) High terminal resistance, which leads to a substantial voltage drop that reduces the power available for use in the system;
      <br/>
      (6) Low electrolyte level, which causes non-uniformity in electrolyte concentration and negatively affects ionic transfer;
      <br/>
      (7) Corroded terminals, which lead to a substantial increase in resistance at the terminal-to-wire connections.
      <br/>
      (8) Battery status, such as:
      <br/>
      Battery capacity,
      <br/>
      Electrolyte adequacy, and
      <br/>
      State of charge (SOC);
      <br/>
      (8) Time to maintain/replace individual batteries, such as the end of a battery's useful life; and
      <br/>
      (9) Current or voltage ramp test.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      For example, a current or voltage ramp test provides a profile of current or voltage over increasing applied current or voltage (ramp up) and over decreasing applied current or voltage (ramp down) directions.
      <br/>
      The SOC is determined of the marginal battery from the current during the ramp down portion of the test.
      <br/>
      Battery capacity is derived from the SOC.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The results of the detailed analysis are reported and actions are recommended at Step 237.
      <br/>
      For example, a marginal battery affected with a faulty condition can be replaced, e.g., by switching to another battery.
      <br/>
      If a reverse connection was detected in Step 235, the condition is reported (Step 237) and the reverse connection is rectified manually.
      <br/>
      Likewise, if a low electrolyte level was detected, the condition is reported and electrolyte is added.
      <br/>
      If it is time to maintain or replace the marginal battery, e.g., because the maximum IR limit is reached, the marginal battery is disconnected for servicing or replacement.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if a high terminal resistance or corroded terminal condition were detected, such conditions would be reported and the affected battery disconnected for servicing (e.g., terminal cleaning).
      <br/>
      The battery power shortfall while the marginal battery is disconnected can be supplanted by switching on another battery, that is, an auxiliary battery.
      <br/>
      If inadequate state of charge (SOC) was detected, then a determination is made whether the marginal battery can be taken offline by shutting down the battery system in Step 239.
      <br/>
      If the marginal battery cannot be taken offline, e.g., the battery power being supplied by the system cannot be interrupted, then the control flows back (via Step E) to Step 221 of FIG. 2A, where battery conditions of all the batteries are continuously monitored.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      If the marginal battery can be taken offline, then a charge/discharge cycle is performed and the battery capacity is detected and verified for normal operation (Step 238).
      <br/>
      The results of the charge/discharge cycle are evaluated in Step 236.
      <br/>
      If the results are within a prescribed range, the marginal battery is charged and then returned in-line for normal operation in the battery circuit.
      <br/>
      The control flow is then reverted back to Step 221 of FIG. 2A, where battery conditions of all the batteries are continuously monitored.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      If the results of the charge/discharge cycle are outside of a prescribed range, then the marginal battery is flagged for discarding or replacement (Step 232).
      <br/>
      The control flow is then reverted back (via Step E) to Step 221 of FIG. 2A, where battery conditions of all the batteries are continuously monitored.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The method of the invention can also be applied to an uninterruptible power/generator system (UPS) having a set of main batteries and a set of auxiliary batteries.
      <br/>
      With reference now to FIG. 3, the operating conditions of the main batteries are continuously monitored at Step 31.
      <br/>
      Normal analysis is performed at Step 32 and a determination is made at Step 33 as to whether any of the main batteries is marginal, substantially as described above in connection with Steps 21-23.
      <br/>
      If no marginal battery is detected, the control flow then reverts to Step 31.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      On the other hand, if a marginal battery is detected, the marginal battery is disconnected (Step 34) and a corresponding auxiliary battery is switched into the circuit to maintain battery power supply (Step 35).
      <br/>
      Additional battery parameters of the affected battery are measured at Step 36 and a detailed analysis is performed using such battery parameters measured (Step 37), substantially as described above.
      <br/>
      The marginal battery is then flagged for service in accordance with the results of the detailed analysis (Step 38).
      <br/>
      The control flow then reverts to Step 31, where the conditions of the main batteries are continuously monitored.

      Referring to FIG. 5, a normal analysis controller 51 is coupled to a plurality of batteries, MAIN BAT. 1-4 and AUX GEN.
      <br/>
      BAT. 1-4. The batteries used in the system are rechargeable batteries of a type commonly used in the art, such as nickel-cadmium, nickel-hydrogen, nickel-zinc, nickel-iron, silver-zinc, zinc bromine, zinc-chlorine, and lead-acid batteries.
      <br/>
      The normal analysis controller 51 continuously analyzes the prevailing battery conditions and implements maintenance and charging functions as described above.
      <br/>
      The battery conditions can be monitored when the load (such as the UPS) itself draws current from the battery bank, e.g., when AUX GEN. 53 is started or when the AC power source is operational.
      <br/>
      When the UPS is not providing power, the normal analysis controller 51 continues to monitor and analyze the temperature, voltage and current conditions from which it determines the IR and SOC of each battery with changes in temperature.

      In operating the battery system, main battery power (from MAIN.

      Thereafter, additional battery parameters of the marginal battery (MAIN BAT. 1) are measured.

      <br/>
      The batteries advantageously operate at peak efficiency with enhanced battery life and the inventive system and method eliminate the need for continuous charging.
      <br/>
      The advantages of the invention further include reduction in total battery cost and prolonged battery life.
