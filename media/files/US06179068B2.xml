    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to directional drilling apparatus, in particular but not solely to directional drilling apparatus which can be used in confined spaces or utilised in locations close to such obstacles such as fences, houses, buildings, etc.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      It is known to provide directional drilling devices which provide directional drilling by means of a drilling head which has an angled cutting or drilling device thereon, the angled device being monitorable in respect to its orientation about the axis of the drill.
      <br/>
      Change in direction of the drill is achieved by ceasing or preventing rotation of the drill bit when said angle device is in a desired orientation and then pushing forward the drill such that the angled device causes the drill to deviate from its current course.
      <br/>
      Drilling can then be recommenced with the drill head being pushed forward in the desired new direction.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Directional drilling (also referred to as boring, thrusting and horizontal directional drilling (HDD) is a technology which allows services such as power cables, ducts, water pipes, gas lines, drainage pipes, etc, to be placed underground without the need to cut open the ground surface as is required in cut and cover methods.
      <br/>
      The drill gains its directional ability through the use of an angled steering blade on the drill head.
      <br/>
      Immediately behind the drill head is a transmitter (sonde) which relays information to an above ground operator, such information may include how deep the drill head is, the direction in which the drill is heading and the orientation of the drill head such as the angle it is pointing up or down.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Such devices are normally bulky and incorporate means to rotate and push forward or advance the drill bead as well as means to rotate it.
      <br/>
      It is also known to provide means to extend the drill such as a set of rods which are screwed into each other to provide additional length to the drill.
      <br/>
      The power requirement of such a device are somewhat high and as these devices incorporate the source of power the devices are large.
      <br/>
      This limits the use of the device in that it is common for drilling to be required substantially horizontally or parallel to the surface of the ground from a distance beneath the surface of the ground.
      <br/>
      Thus since the abovementioned device must rest on ground level the drill must be angled in from the surface of the ground such that it levels off at the required depth.
      <br/>
      The drills as aforementioned are of course flexible to some degree however flexibility is limited therefore to the angle at which the drill enters the ground.
      <br/>
      This means that the drilling unit itself must be positioned some distance back from the point at which the level drilling commences.
      <br/>
      Obviously this is inconvenient and may in some cases limit drilling.
      <br/>
      It may in other cases mean that neighbouring land must be encroached upon and as the ultimate length of the drill usable by such a device is limited, the length of useful drilling may also be somewhat lirmited.
      <br/>
      There is also a need for apparatus which can be used in situations when the pit or hole that is possible or preferable is somewhat smaller than the abovementioned apparatus.
      <br/>
      For example it is often the case when drilling under a road that the grass strip or verge beside the footpath is very narrow.
      <br/>
      It would be useful to have drilling apparatus which can be used in a pit which can be dug in this grass verge without having to remove or disturb the footpath or road.
      <br/>
      However a drawback of such a drilling apparatus could be that the drill rods utilised would also have to be relatively compact.
      <br/>
      This would limit the efficiency of drilling as the drill requires the attachments of drill rods one behind the other.
    </p>
    <p num="6">There is therefore a need for drilling apparatus which can be used in a configuration in which longer drill rods can be utilised therefore the apparatus itself is long but can be converted to a form in which the drilling apparatus itself is more compact.</p>

    <p num="40">
      BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING(S)
      <br/>
      Preferred forms of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which;
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows directional drilling apparatus according to a preferred form of the present invention. The directional drilling device is articulated from a prime mover or other source of power 2. Such articulation may be achieved by means of a linkage arrangement 3. Suitable linkage arrangements being obvious to those skilled in the art to which the invention relates. The present invention provides for the advancement of a drill rod 7 in a desired direction. The advantage of the present invention over the prior art ("prior art" will be described shortly) is that the useful length 5 of the drill rod 7 is greater than that of the prior art as it is easier to commence drilling at the level required. The provision of a relatively small hole 4 allows the apparatus 1 to be placed at or near the desired drilling depth;
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 shows a prior art arrangement in which the drill rod 7 is advanced by a unit 10. Such a unit incorporates a source of power and means to rotate and change direction of the drill rod 7 together. Such a unit is obviously bulky and the angle 11 which the drill must enter the ground limits the useful length 5 of the drill rod 7;
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows a drill head 20, such a drill head incorporated into the present invention. Such drill heads are known in the art to which the invention relates, the prime function of such a drill head is that when it is rotated to the appropriate direction it advances in a substantially straight manner. However as the drill head 20 has an angled cutting blade 21 at the cutting surface thereof, if the rotation of the drill head 20 is stopped and the drill head itself pushed forward in the direction labelled 22 the drill head 20 changes direction along that indicated by 23. Rotation of the drill head thereafter may be commenced allowing the drill to advance in its new direction, such known drill heads incorporate means by which an operator or user can ascertain the orientation of the angled blade 21. The orientation can of course be varied by means of rotating the drill head 20. Once the drill head 20 is in the desired orientation it can be advanced thus changing the direction of the drill;
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows a directional drilling apparatus according to a preferred form of the present invention. Such a device incorporates means 30 to rotate the extendable drill and drill head 7 and 20. Such apparatus also incorporates means to advance said extendable drill and drill head such that the direction of directional drill head can be varied. The means to rotate said drill rod 7 may comprise means to grip the outside of said drill rod 7 and rotate it. Means to rotate and advance said drill rod 7 may comprise articulated means to push forward the drill preferably using any means to grip the outside of the drill rod 7 provided by the means 30 to rotate the drill;
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows a specially preferred form of the present invention in which actuators are provided to increase the stability of the drilling apparatus 1. In use, this preferred form of the apparatus is attached to the prime mover or digger by means of a quick fit bucket fastening 54. A bearing 57 is provided to allow for 360 (degree)  +- 80 rotation of the drilling apparatus 1. An actuator 56 is provided to allow for the sideways cant of the drilling apparatus 1. The stabilizing surfaces 50, 51 and 52 are extendable when the actuators for example, hydraulic actuators are extended, the stabilising surfaces 50, 51 and 52 extend and bear against the internal surfaces of the hole 4 or they may extend against a digger blade, wall or other suitable surface or device, enabling additional stability to be provided and thus greater accuracy in drilling. In other forms of the invention the stabilisers may simply comprise flat plates, however they may be textured to provide additional grip, or, in preferred forms of the invention they may have a series, for example, of three spikes to increase the "bite" of the stabilisers;
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows an end elevation of directional drilling apparatus 1 according to a preferred form of the present invention;
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 shows another end elevation of directional drilling apparatus 1 according to a preferred form of the present invention;
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 shows a top view of directional drilling apparatus 1 according to a preferred form of the present invention;
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="42">
      Preferred forms of the present invention provide directional drilling apparatus 1.
      <br/>
      Said directional drilling apparatus as articulated are known in the art to which the present invention relates 3 from a prime mover or other source of power 2.
      <br/>
      The source of power or prime mover 2 is preferably but not necessarily easily moveable.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In preferred forms of the present invention, prime mover 2 provides power and perhaps control of the directional drilling apparatus 1 and in other preferred forms the power is provided by means of a hydraulic circuit or connection.
      <br/>
      Such connections will be obvious to those skilled in the art to which the invention relates.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The apparatus itself may comprise means 30 to rotate the drill rod 7.
      <br/>
      Such means may comprise a hydraulic motor and may incorporate jaws or clamping devices which hold the outer surface of the drill rod 7.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The directional drilling ability of a drill is achieved through the use of an angled steering blade on the drill head.
      <br/>
      A transmitter relays information to the operator above ground.
      <br/>
      Information transmitted may consist of a variety of types such as how deep the drill head is, the direction in which it is heading, the orientation, ie angle up or down of the drill head.
      <br/>
      This information is used by the operator to steer or control the drill.
      <br/>
      For example if the operator requires the drill to steer to the right to avoid an existing underground service the aboveground locator operator would instruct the drill operator to rotate the drill head to 3 o'clock and push (thrust) the drill head forward which will cause the drill to flex and head to the right.
      <br/>
      Once the drill head is heading in the desired direction and the drill head is required to track in a straight direction, the drill operator spins or rotates (a combination of pushing and rotating) the required distance until another change of direction is required.
      <br/>
      The use of a combination of spinning and pushing or thrusting and rotating makes it possible to steer under, over or around obstacles and arrive at the desired end point with a great deal of accuracy.
      <br/>
      The level of accuracy is of course dependant upon the ground conditions encountered.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Once the drill head is at its end point, for examples drilling may have occurred from one side of the road to the other, the drill head would ordinarily be removed and a cutter and/or packer attached to the drill or drill pipe or string with the service, for example power cable, duct, water pipe, gas line or drainage pipe attached.
      <br/>
      The drill or drill rods would then be pulled out of the ground while the drill is rotating, thus giving the cutter and/or packer a cutting action in allowing a hole of sufficient diameter to be formed for the pipe or cable duct line or service to be installed.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Preferred forms of the present invention can be used in particular in residential areas where the distance required to be drilled is often no more than 100 meters.
      <br/>
      Access to the site is often difficult and it is quite often the case that there is no lead-in room.
      <br/>
      That is, it is often not possible to move a great distance back from the initial entry point in order to provide access to the required depth of the drill.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Drills according to these preferred forms of the invention can be of a compact size and this can increase the number of sites which can be used.
      <br/>
      In particular drills according to preferred forms of the present invention can be launched both up and down hill.
      <br/>
      At least some preferred forms of the present invention can be set up to drill at right angles to a road thereby limiting the disruption to traffic.
    </p>
    <p num="49">One example of the present invention generates 800 pounds of thrust and approximately 10,500 pounds of pull-back from an 18 horse power source.</p>
    <p num="50">
      Preferred forms of the present invention have a drive mechanism which utilises no thrust chains, cogs or pulleys.
      <br/>
      This limits the amount of maintenance required.
    </p>
    <p num="51">Preferred hydraulic pump forms of the invention utilise a fluid supply which comprises a main pressure water source such as a garden hose.</p>
    <p num="52">
      As mentioned previously, at least preferred forms of the present invention can be launched above or below ground pointing up or down.
      <br/>
      Up to  +- 80 degrees of launch angle are possible.
    </p>
    <p num="53">In preferred forms of the present invention the unitary drilling apparatus itself can swivel through 360 (degree)  +- 80 when utilised with an excavator or prime mover with an ability to rotate through 360 (degree)  +- 80 and the ability to offset the boom of said excavator a great deal of flexibility is provided.</p>
    <p num="54">
      In preferred forms of the present invention, the unitary drilling apparatus is attached or attachable to a prime mover or excavator or digger.
      <br/>
      This means that a user requires less specialised equipment and can lower costs.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      As described earlier, to control the direction of the drill rod 7 the orientation of the cutting blade 21 must be ascertained and then the drill advanced without rotation.
      <br/>
      In the preferred form of the present invention advancement is provided by means 30 to advance the drill and drill head.
      <br/>
      Such means may comprise an hydraulic ram or may utilise chains and suitable gear wheels to provide for the forward articulation of the drill.
    </p>
    <p num="56">The monitoring of the orientation of the cutting blade 21 may be achieved by radio transmission or a utilised communication means which may be provided up a hollow centre of the drill rod 7.</p>
    <p num="57">
      In preferred forms of the present invention, the drill rod 7 is made up of links of either solid bar or preferably tube.
      <br/>
      Said tube of course having a aperture there through and in preferred forms of the invention the aperture there through maybe used to provide either a cutting fluid or simply water to the drill head 20.
      <br/>
      Such provision of water facilitates the washing away of material at the drill head.
    </p>
    <p num="58">In preferred forms of the invention, the drill rod 7 is made up of links of drill which are screwed one into the other by means of a threaded portion.</p>
    <p num="59">
      Prior art directional drilling apparatus utilise links of drill rod 7 of 31/2 and sometimes 4 meters in length.
      <br/>
      Preferred forms of the present invention utilise drill rod 7 which are made up of links of bar or tube which are less than 31/2meters in length.
    </p>
    <p num="60">When in use, the present invention provides for the addition of additional links to the drill rod 7 by means of releasing the device gripping the outer surface of the drill retracting the means to rotate the drill, facing an additional length of drill rod 7 into the unit, attaching said additional length of drill to the preceding length of drill and then reclamping the device to grip the other surface of drill rod 7 to a rearward portion of the additional drill link.</p>
    <p num="61">
      Preferred forms of the present invention, in particular the form illustrated in FIG. 5, allow for the quick fitting of the drilling apparatus 1 to the prime mover.
      <br/>
      Also present, in this preferred form of the invention is a bearing 57.
      <br/>
      This bearing allows a 360 (degree)  +- 80 rotation of the drilling apparatus 1.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art to which the invention relates will realise that a variety of different bearings will be suitable.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      An actuator 56 allows for the sideways cant of the drilling apparatus 1.
      <br/>
      The actuator may be hydraulically powered.
    </p>
    <p num="63">Preferred forms of the present invention utilising a floating ram system as shown in FIG. 12 provide a system whereby the actuating devices 200 and 201 are first extended, moving the device into position 2 as shown in FIG. 12; then the second actuating device 300 is extended to its actuated position or condition, bringing the device into the position 3 as shown in FIG. 12; the actuating devices and second actuating devices are then retracted, reverting the device into the position 1 as shown in FIG. 12. In position 1 a new drill rod 7 can be added and the process described above repeated.</p>
    <p num="64">As the drill rods are withdrawn out of the ground and the pipe, cable or other utility is being pulled into the ground the reverse of the above sequence of operation is performed.</p>
    <p num="65">
      Devices incorporating this preferred form of the present invention enable the length of the drill rod 7 to be reduced in some cases for example to 2.1 meters and use a 1 m drill rod.
      <br/>
      The weight of the device can be reduced perhaps by 30%, that is maybe down to 210 kilos giving an improved power to weight ratio.
      <br/>
      The drive train is believed to be more reliable than those utilising gears, cogs or cables.
    </p>
    <p num="66">Comparing the performance of such a system with previous technology it has been found that 8,000 pounds of thrust and 10,500 pounds of pull-back can be generated from an 18 horse power engine using the abovementioned preferred form of the present invention whereas using known drive train techniques only 7,200 pounds of thrust and 8,000 pounds of pull-back are generated from an engine rated at 55.4 horse power for example.</p>
    <p num="67">
      In the form of the invention as illustrated in FIG. 5, 10 and 11 stabilizing surfaces 50, 51 and 52 are present.
      <br/>
      Said stabilizing surfaces are advanced by means of actuators for example hydraulic actuators and bear against the internal surfaces of the hole 4.
      <br/>
      The stabilisers have the effect of locking the drilling apparatus 1 into the hole 4 thus increasing the accuracy of the drilling.
      <br/>
      The stabilizing surfaces 50, 51 and 52 are preferably remotely controllable by an operator.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      As can be shown in the figures the present invention provides a unitary directional drilling device which can be placed into a small hole 4 or above ground.
      <br/>
      Thus the use of the length of drill is maximised With reference to FIG. 13, the size of the unitary drilling apparatus 1 is preferably adjustable, for example, by means of removing the portion of the drilling apparatus 1 which lies beyond the line 100.
      <br/>
      In certain forms of the invention this is done by removal of the end portion of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      Then removal of the portion of the drilling apparatus 1 beyond the line 100.
      <br/>
      The end portion is then reattached to the drilling apparatus.
      <br/>
      In this form of the invention drilling rods of the smallest size must be available to be used when the drilling apparatus is in its smaller or non-extended form.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The form of the present invention as shown in FIG. 13 provides a unitary drilling apparatus which can be adjusted as to size thereby enabling it to be used in pits or holes or situations where the fill size or larger apparatus would run into difficulties.
      <br/>
      In its smaller form the apparatus 1 utilises rods which are somewhat smaller than those utilised when it is in its expanded or larger form.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      A variety of techniques can be employed to provide the multiple sizing of the apparatus 1.
      <br/>
      In the form illustrated, a piece of the apparatus is removed to enable it to function as a smaller unit.
      <br/>
      In other forms the apparatus may be telescopic with one portion of the unit 1 sliding onto or into another portion so as to provide for the size adjustment.
