      A sensor for a selected target species has (a) a substrate which has been chemically modified by attachment of substrate modifiers; (b) one or more magnetically active beads which have been chemically modified by attachment of bead modifiers, where these bead modifiers will have a binding affinity for the substrate modifiers in the presence of the target species, and a measurably different binding affinity for the substrate modifiers in the absence of the target species; (c) an adjustable source of a magnetic field for exerting a force on the beads; and (d) an imaging system, for observing and counting beads bound to the substrate.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the invention further has a system for identifying clusters of beads, and for removing the effect of such clusters from measurements of the target analyte.
      <br/>
      As with other assays, the sensor relies on the ability of certain molecules to bind with specific target (analyte) molecules.
      <br/>
      By coating the beads and the substrate with appropriate molecules, the beads will (or will not) bind specifically to the substrate in the presence (or absence) of the target molecule.
      <br/>
      When a magnetic field is applied to the substrate, the magnetic beads will be pulled away from the substrate.
      <br/>
      If the beads are specifically bound to the substrate, however, the beads will be retained on the substrate, indicating the presence (or absence) of the target species.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to assays and more specifically to binding assays, such as antibody/hapten or DNA interactions, taking advantage of the differing strengths of these interactions from each other and from non-specific binding interactions, and using labels that respond to a magnetic field.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Binding assays, for example immunoassays, are widely used in the food, medical, and pharmaceutical industries as diagnostic tests for a wide range of target molecules.
      <br/>
      Many binding assays have been produced and marketed since the principle was first developed.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Immunoassays typically exploit the binding capabilities of antibodies.
      <br/>
      Antibodies are protein molecules which are frequently considered fighters of infections.
      <br/>
      They fight infections by binding to the infectious material in a specific manner, forming a complex.
      <br/>
      This is a signal to the organism to reject that complex.
      <br/>
      Antibodies may also be produced to specifically bind to a wide range of compounds, as a key fits a lock.
      <br/>
      However other molecules (e.g., chelators, strands of polynucleic acids, receptors including cellular receptors) that are capable of recognizing and selectively binding other molecules may be employed to detect a wide range of species, such as polynucleic acids (DNA or RNA), polypeptides, glycolipids, hormones, polymers, metal ions, and certain low molecular weight organic species including a number of illegal drugs.
      <br/>
      To be useful in an assay, this recognition event must generate a signal that is macroscopically observable.
      <br/>
      The method employed to generate such a signal is one way of distinguishing the various types of immunoassays.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the initial embodiment of an immunoassay, radioactivity was employed.
      <br/>
      This radioimmunoassay (RIA) is quite sensitive and widely used, but the hazards, expense, and restrictions associated with handling radioactive material makes alternative immunoassays desirable.
      <br/>
      Recently, enzyme and fluorescence assays have replaced radioassays.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A few immunoassays use magnetically active labels to detect chemical compounds, and associate the force applied by these magnetic labels in a magnetic field with the amount of the analyte present.
      <br/>
      See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,445,970 and 5,445,971, both issued on Aug. 29, 1995 to Rohr.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The Rohr patents use magnetically active beads, an externally applied magnetic field, and a balance for monitoring the force applied by these beads to a chemically modified substrate.
      <br/>
      In a typical embodiment (a sandwich assay), both the magnetically active beads and the substrate are modified to have antibodies for the analyte bound to their surfaces.
      <br/>
      The antibody--antibody interactions between the beads and the substrate will not produce specific binding interactions, although some non-specific adsorption may occur.
      <br/>
      If an external magnetic field is applied, the field will separate the beads from the substrate.
      <br/>
      If the analyte is introduced into the system, it will bind to the beads and the substrate in a sandwich configuration, thus linking the beads to the substrate through a specific binding interaction.
      <br/>
      When an external magnetic field is applied to this system, the field will, depending on its orientation, push or pull on the beads, changing the force measured by the balance, thereby indicating the presence and (in principle) amount of analyte present.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      One of the drawbacks of Rohr's work is that it only measures an integrated signal related to the behavior of a multitude of beads experiencing a range of magnetic conditions.
      <br/>
      This is particularly problematic, because the work of the present inventors has shown that the beads in this system interact in complex ways.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Referring to FIG. 1, a significant fraction of beads in Rohr's system will tend to clump together, and the behavior of these clumped beads is not easily modeled.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 depicts typical paramagnetic beads on a substrate, in an applied magnetic field, as they might be seen through a typical optical microscope.
      <br/>
      One sees from FIG. 1 that some of the beads aggregate into strings and clusters.
      <br/>
      In some cases, the bead dipoles may align, creating a larger magnetic moment than anticipated.
      <br/>
      Rohr's invention takes into account none of this behavior, and thus is plagued by low sensitivity.
      <br/>
      A more reliable qualitative and quantitative system would monitor the behavior of individual beads, and correct for or cancel the effect of complex interactions that would be a source of errors in Rohr's system.
      <br/>
      Additionally, such a system would inherently be more precise, since each bead could be monitored.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      A second drawback of Rohr's work is the unstated assumption that time is not a variable in this system.
      <br/>
      Each of the assays disclosed in Rohr's patents show the signal to be associated with only the concentration of the analyte.
      <br/>
      The work of the present inventors has shown that the magnetic beads in an applied field will dissociate from a substrate as a function of time and temperature, following a Boltzmann distribution curve.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      An improved binding assay sensor would allow for the discrimination between complex binding interactions at the single bead level.
      <br/>
      An improved binding assay sensor would also provide additional information beyond the presence or absence of a binding interaction, such as information about the strength of that specific interaction.
      <br/>
      A part of developing such additional information, it would be valuable to have a method for developing force-binding curves for target analytes.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="27">
      The present invention relies on identifying the force required to separate labeled beads from a substrate.
      <br/>
      To ensure a high sensitivity and consistent results, it is desired to keep the forces acting on the beads simple (i.e., readily analyzed) and uniform (i.e., essentially the same for all beads in a sample and reproducible from run-to-run).
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      One aspect of this is to have the force operate on the beads at a uniform angle, preferably 90 (degree) , relative to the substrate, across the sample area.
      <br/>
      A force applied to the bead 90 (degree)  relative to the substrate is directly transduced to the point of contact of the bead with the surface.
      <br/>
      The effect of tangential forces can be determined by executing a force balance on a spherical particle attached to a surface at a single point (FIG. 2). K.-C. Chang et al., in "Influence of Direction and Type of Applied Force on the Detachment of Macromolecularly-Bound Particles from Surfaces", Langmuir 12(9) 2271-82 (1996), have analyzed the effect of tangential force on such a system.
      <br/>
      The tensile force T applied to a specific molecular interaction by a tangential force Ft is the component of force oriented in the direction of the specific molecular interaction
      <br/>
      Ft=T cos  PHI .
    </p>
    <p num="29">The tilt of the bead,  PHI , is determined by the geometry of the system  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="30">
      where L is the length of the specific molecular interaction complex, h is the surface roughness of the bead and a is bead radius.
      <br/>
      Given the properties of a typical bead (a=1,250 nm and h=5 nm) and complex (L=10 nm) the effect of tangential force on the specific molecular interaction is amplified by approximately a factor of 11.
      <br/>
      The angular dependence of the tensile and normal forces, FIG. 3, show the dramatic effect of small variations in the orientation of the force.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a preferred feature of the invention is to apply the external force to the beads normally and without torque.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Referring to FIG. 4, depicting a sandwich assay configuration for the present invention, one or more beads 10 and a substrate 12 are disposed in solution.
      <br/>
      The bead 10 is modified with molecules which are referred to herein as bead modifiers 22, and the substrate 12 is modified with molecules that are referred to herein as substrate modifiers 23.
      <br/>
      Both of these types of modifiers will be selected from those molecules that are capable of recognizing and selectively binding other molecules, including antibodies, haptens, polynucleic acids, polypeptides, glycolipids, hormones, polymers, metal ions, and certain low molecular weight organic species.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The mechanism for applying a variable, normal field to the bead 10 is shown here as a movable annular magnet 24.
      <br/>
      The annular magnet produces a uniform B field which is oriented along its axis across millimeter size areas.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that a millimeter scale NdFeB magnet can apply a uniform field over sample areas consistent with imaging by optical microscopy, if the magnet is carefully centered.
      <br/>
      This normal B field acts upon the bead 10 to create a normal force (F) on bead 10, which in turn puts tension on the bond 14 between the bead 10 and the substrate 12.
      <br/>
      Since covalent bonds are typically much stronger than specific molecular interactions (such as antibody-hapten interactions), the strength of the linkage 14 between the bead 10 and the substrate 12 is limited by the strength of this specific molecular interaction.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In addition to annular magnets, other magnetic geometries may be used, such as discs, bars, or other flat shapes, so long as the B field has the desired properties in the area under observation.
      <br/>
      High permeability focusing cones positioned between the magnet and the substrate may be used to shape the field so that the field has a higher gradient.
      <br/>
      Since the force on a paramagnetic bead is related to the field gradient (see below), the use of these cones will tend to increase the forces acting on the beads.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      As the field intensity is varied, eventually a point is reached where the bead separates from the substrate, indicating that the force from the field has exceeded the strength of nonspecific or specific molecular interaction.
      <br/>
      By observing when beads separate from the substrate, one can observe when this point is reached.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the inventor has observed this separation point will depend not only on the force applied to the linkage between the bead and the substrate, but also on the observation time and the system temperature, as will be discussed below.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      A preferred embodiment of the invention further comprises a microscope, typically an optical microscope 26, for imaging beads bound to the substrate, and separated from the substrate.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the microscope 26 is connected through connecting electronics (often including a video camera) 27 to a computer 28 or to a video recorder for analyzing images from the microscope.
      <br/>
      The advantage of the annular magnet 24 is that it does not interfere with transmitted light in an optical microscope.
      <br/>
      However, reflected light microscopy makes it possible to use solid magnet geometries.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Preferably, a population of modified beads are used in the present invention, rather than a single modified bead.
      <br/>
      The large number of beads simultaneously sample the entire sensor area overcoming diffusion limitations to the sensitivity of the detector.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      For this preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be important to have the capacity to identify single beads (as distinguished from aggregates), to count the beads quickly and reliably, and to determine their relative position on the substrate.
      <br/>
      This positional information is advantageous for several reasons.
      <br/>
      For example, in some applications it may be advantageous to pattern the substrate by attaching different types of substrate modifiers on different regions of the substrate.
      <br/>
      It will be advantageous in such applications to identify where on a substrate a given bead is bound.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the imaging system for the present invention, including the microscope 26, computer 28, and connecting electronics 27, should have the capacity to count beads that have separated from the substrate (or, alternatively, count beads that have not separated from the substrate).
      <br/>
      Typically, this will mean capturing a digital image from the microscope (either directly using a frame grabber or indirectly using a video recorder) and analyzing it using image analysis algorithms on the computer 28.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Additionally, it is preferred to provide a translation stage 40 for mounting the substrate, to permit the microscope to image various areas on the substrate with repeatability.
      <br/>
      It is further preferred to use a microscope that has fluorescence detection capability.
      <br/>
      When a translation stage 40, a microscope with fluorescence detection capability, and substrate with different types of substrate modifiers on different regions of the substrate, the apparatus may be used to detect a plurality of different target molecules with great facility (multiplexing).
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Additionally, the imaging system for the present invention preferably has the capacity to discriminate between single beads on the substrate and clusters of two or more beads on the substrate, based on their size.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that non-uniform surface chemistries and magnetic fields of the structures taught by Rohr produce the following non-ideal behavior.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Brownian motion causes the beads to move on the surface.
      <br/>
      This motion leads a significant fraction of the beads to form dimers and aggregates, if the beads are "sticky" (i.e., tend to stay together once they are brought together).
      <br/>
      Multibody interactions in these aggregates lead to enhanced magnetization of the clusters when the B field is applied, and greatly accelerates their displacement.
      <br/>
      Image analysis allows one to identify the level of aggregation and correct for its effects.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the fraction of beads as monomers and aggregates is strongly related to the amount of analyte on the surface and the nonspecific adhesive properties of the surfaces; therefore, aggregation can also be used to independently determine analyte concentration and surface properties.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Furthermore, under all but the most ideal circumstances a fraction (2-20%) of the beads adhere to the surface nonspecifically, even under high forces (&gt;2 pN).
      <br/>
      It has been observed that these beads capture other beads that move laterally in the solution, and thus form string shaped aggregates.
      <br/>
      Image analysis makes it possible to identify these aggregates and discard them from consideration.
      <br/>
      Detection techniques that measure integrated signals can not distinguish these beads from specifically bound beads.
    </p>
    <p num="42">Nonspecific adhesion between beads, and between beads and the substrate, appears to increase when the beads are loaded with proteins, which suggests protein--protein interactions are the primary source for this adhesion.</p>
    <p num="43">
      It has been discovered that a commercially available microscope (Axiovert 100 microscope with a 63 *  Acroplan objective, Carl Zeiss, One Zeiss Dr., Thornwood, N.Y. 10594), electronics (VE-1000 CCD72 black/white video system from DAGE-MTI, Michigan City, Ind.; DT 3152 Fidelity PCI frame grabber, Data Translation, 100 Locke Dr, Marlboro, Mass. 01752-1192), image analysis software (Image-Pro Version 2.0, Media Cybernetics, 8484 Georgia Ave., Silver Spring, Md. 20910), and computer (Pentium 66 MHz Computer with 1 GB hard drive) will reliably identify superparamagnetic 2.6 micron diameter beads and clusters thereof.
      <br/>
      Once clusters have been identified, they can be ignored, i.e. discounted from further analysis.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the position of the beads is monitored (i.e., monitored for whether the beads are bound or unbound to the substrate), only single beads will be analyzed, dramatically improving the accuracy of the detector.
    </p>
    <p num="44">It has further been discovered that beads imaged through such a microscope may be monitored for movement, and that unbound beads will move over a time scale of a few seconds, permitting these beads to be identified as unbound, and likewise discounted from further analysis.</p>
    <p num="45">The magnitude of the adhesive force between the bead and surface is determined by several factors, i.e., the magnitude of the nonspecific forces, the number of specific molecular interactions linking the bead to the surface and the manner in which these interactions are stressed.</p>
    <p num="46">
      Surface modification chemistries (described below) have been developed that consistently produce very low nonspecific adhesive forces in a majority of beads.
      <br/>
      Typically, 80-98% of the beads can be removed from a surface at force equivalent to their buoyant weight, i.e., .apprxeq.40 femtoNewtons (fN) in the case of Dynal's M280 beads.
      <br/>
      The number of specific molecular interactions linking a bead to the surface will depend on the density and flexibility of ligands and receptors on the bead and surface.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Using Hertzian contact mechanics we can estimate the area of contact of a 2.6 micron sphere under a 40 pN load assuming the elastic modulus of the materials is 1010 Pa (K. L. Johnson, "Contact Mechanics," 1985 Cambridge University Press, New York, N.Y.).
      <br/>
      The calculated contact radius is 0.15 nm which is significantly smaller than the size of a typical ligand or receptor which makes a single intermolecular interaction most probable.
      <br/>
      However, the fact that the ligands and receptors are bound to the surfaces through polymeric linkers could enable multiple intermolecular interactions to take place.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In fact, it has been discovered that unless steps are taken to mitigate, typically there will be more than one specific binding linkage between a bead and the substrate, despite the small contact area between a flat surface and, e.g., a 2.6  MU m diameter sphere.
      <br/>
      This discovery has been predicated on the observation that typical antibody-functionalized spheres may adhere to an antigen-coated surface with a force much greater than 200 pN.
      <br/>
      One would expect these beads to adhere with forces less than about 200 pN if they were attached through a single antibody-antigen linkage, given that the biotin-streptavidin interaction (one of the strongest in nature) only has a binding strength of about 250 pN.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      To mitigate these effects, skilled practitioners will minimize the roughness of the interacting surfaces.
      <br/>
      In particular, it is preferred to keep the peak-to-valley roughness of the substrate  &lt;= ca. 30 nm. In addition to the roughness of the interacting surfaces, other factors that skilled practitioners may identify as influencing the number of molecular interactions between a bead and a substrate include (a) the surface density of antibodies and antigens on these beads and substrates, (b) the mechanical properties of the beads and substrates, and (c) the steric mobility (flexibility) of the polymer used to attach the antibodies and antigens to the surface.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      It has been discovered that a linkage between a bead and a substrate that comprises a specific binding interaction, such as an antibody/hapten interaction, has a lifetime that can be described by a Boltzmann probability curve (G.
      <br/>
      U Lee, et al, Langmuir 1994, 10 pp. 354-357).
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that this lifetime may be described by the equation
    </p>
    <p num="51">TAU = TAU 0 e-(E-F * d)/kT</p>
    <p num="52">
      where  TAU =the lifetime of a bond,  TAU 0 =a constant associated with the bond, F=applied force, E=the bond energy, d=distance associated with ligand receptor interaction and kT=thermal energy.
      <br/>
      The coupling of interaction force and the length of time the bond is loaded has important implications for the behavior of the beads under an applied force.
      <br/>
      For example, the bond strength of the intermolecular interaction will appear stronger over shorter time frames.
      <br/>
      If the rate of loading is too slow it may not be possible to distinguish a specific rupture force from a nonspecific force.

    <p num="53">In addition to sandwich assay embodiments, the invention may be practiced in the other immunoassay configurations, e.g., competitive assay and displacement assay embodiments.</p>
    <p num="54">
      In a competitive assay according to the invention, the substrate is modified with the target molecule, or a portion thereof, and the beads are modified with a molecule capable of specifically binding to the target molecule.
      <br/>
      Free target molecules will compete with the substrate bound target molecules for binding sites on the beads.
      <br/>
      If a bead is completely complexed with the analyte target molecules, such that there are no accessible binding sites available for binding to the substrate, the bead will not specifically bind to the substrate.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment of the invention, it may be preferable to limit the number of binding sites on the beads.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the beads will have only a small number of binding sites (e.g.,  &lt;= 10).
      <br/>
      In this way, a small number of free target molecules that interacts with a bead will be sufficient to prevent that bead from complexing with the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In a displacement assay according to the invention, the substrate is modified with a molecule capable of specifically binding to the target molecule, and the beads are modified with the target molecule, or a portion thereof.
      <br/>
      If the beads are complexed with the substrate, and target molecules are introduced into the solution, a target molecule will have a certain probability of displacing a bound bead on the substrate, freeing that bead to separate from the substrate in the applied field.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the analyte may be premixed with the modified beads, and the beads and analyte may be added to the substrate together.

      Typically, it will be advantageous to limit nonspecific adsorption by coating the substrate with an agent that minimizes nonspecific adhesion.
      <br/>
      It has been found that commonly used blocking agents, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) are less useful for the present invention, because the physically adsorbed BSA molecules are not covalently linked to the surface, may be displaced by molecules with higher binding affinities for the substrate and may act as a bridging agent under some conditions.

      It has been discovered that certain chemisorbed polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), will reduce nonspecific adhesive particle-substrate forces by producing strong repulsive forces.

      The origin of the repulsive force is still an issue of some scientific debate, but is believed to originate from the unfavorable entropic energy that is required to compress the chemisorbed polymer (Intermolecular and Surface Forces, J. Israelachvili, Academic Press, San Diego, 1992).

      In addition to use as an assay, the apparatus of the invention may be used to characterize the strength of specific binding interactions, i.e., determining the nature of the interaction between a target species and a species that undergoes a specific binding interaction with that target species.
      <br/>
      For instance, the substrate may be modified with substrate modifiers selected from the group of antibodies, polynucleic acids, polypeptides, glycolipids, hormones, polymers, metal ions, chelating agents, and hormones, and one or more magnetically active beads may be modified by attaching bead modifiers selected from the group of antibodies, polynucleic acids, polypeptides, glycolipids, hormones, polymers, metal ions, chelating agents, and hormones, where these bead modifiers have a binding affinity for the substrate modifiers in the presence of the target species, and a measurably different binding affinity for the substrate modifiers in the absence of the target species.

      The beads or surfaces are then disposed in a solution containing the target molecule.

      These interactions typically include both specific and nonspecific interactions.

      A magnetic field is applied to the beads, preferably normally with respect to the substrate, for pulling the beads away from the substrate.

      This field typically starts at a low strength, and is gradually increased in strength, until the beads, or a predetermined fraction of the beads, separate from the substrate.

      FIG. 5 is a hypothetical force vs. bead release curve for an optimal time and temperature.
      <br/>
      One sees from FIG. 5 that the separation of the beads from the substrate will occur in roughly two stages: a first stage at lower field, corresponding to the removal of non-specifically bound beads, and a second stage, corresponding to the removal of specifically bound beads.
      <br/>
      The second stage will occur at higher field strengths than the first stage and will be highly dependent on the rate at which the force is applied to the beads.
      <br/>
      By varying the rate at which the forces is applied to the beads it is possible to measure the three critical parameters necessary to characterize the specific molecular interaction  TAU 0, E and d. Of course, if the bead-substrate interaction is more complex (i.e., more than one type of interaction) the separation curve may show more than two stages.

      Paramagnetic materials have a net magnetization  MU  only in the presence of an applied external field B. Nonporous paramagnetic beads (usually made from an impregnated polymer) are used for magnetic separation in molecular biology because of their relatively low density and lack of residual magnetism.

      They may also have surface functional groups (such as amine or carboxyl) that may be used to covalently immobilize receptors (e.g., streptavidin, antibodies, or DNA).

      The principle of FDA was first demonstrated with the model ligand and receptor system streptavidin and biotin.
      <br/>
      Streptavidin is a protein with four receptor sites for biotin that are located in two sets on opposing sides of the molecule.
      <br/>
      The biotin-streptavidin interaction was chosen as it is among the strongest interactions that occur in nature, i.e., k=1015 M-1 (M. B. Savage, "Avidin-Biotin Chemistry: A Handbook" Pierce Chemical Co, 1992).

      Biotin was detected in the form of biotinylated bovine serum albumin (BBSA), i.e., bovine serum albumin to which .about.8 biotin molecules have been covalently attached through the primary amines.
      <br/>
      BBSA was used rather than biotin as it minimizes the nonspecific adhesion of the beads with the surface.
      <br/>
      Varying concentrations of BBSA were incubated with separate aliquots of streptavidin-functionalized superparamagnetic beads (Dynal, Lake Success, N.Y.), the beads were incubated with separate biotin-PEG microscope slides and a force was applied to the beads while observing their relative position in a video enhanced optical microscope (described above).

      At a critical force, the force pulling the beads away from the surface overcomes nonspecific adhesion and gravitational forces, and beads that were not specifically adsorbed were lifted off the surface.

    <p num="89">
      The limit of sensitivity of the assay is 10 ng/ml of BBSA.

    <p num="105">Indirect Detection of Ovalbumin Using a Sandwich Assay</p>
    <p num="106">
      This assay was similar to the direct assay used for ovalbumin in that rabbit and goat antibodies were used to sandwich the ovalbumin.
      <br/>
      The primary difference was that a goat antirabbit antibody is directly conjugated to the beads rather than an antibody against ovalbumin.
      <br/>
      The sandwich was assembled by adding ovalbumin to the goat antiovalbumin antibody functionalized surfaces, adding the rabbit antiovalbumin antibody to the surface and then adding the goat antirabbit antibody functionalized beads to the surface.
      <br/>
      The advantage of this assay is that its sensitivity is currently 10 pg/ml of ovalbumin which is 100 times better than ELISA.
