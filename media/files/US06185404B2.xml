    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to an image processing apparatus for processing an input image and recording the image on a recording medium, and more particularly to an image processing apparatus which is suitably applied to a color copying apparatus that is capable of effecting the color copying of an image of an original.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">Conventionally, an image processing apparatus is adapted to read an image of an original placed on an original table or the like and effect a faithful recording (copying) operation, as instructed by the operator.</p>
    <p num="6">The progress in copying technology in recent years, coupled with that in color-image recording technology, has made it possible to output a copy image which is very close to an image of an original.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Accordingly, with a conventional apparatus, if money or a certificate such as a negotiable instrument the copying of which is prohibited is placed on the original table and copying is effected by misusing the apparatus or by way of a "prank" or the like, copying is effected as instructed by the operator.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there is the possibility of readily inducing an act of forgery, thereby presenting a major social problem.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an image processing apparatus which is capable of preventing in advance an act of forgery of money, a negotiable instrument, or the like, thereby overcoming the above-described problem of the conventional art.</p>
    <p num="9">
      To this end, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided an image processing apparatus comprising: means for determining whether or not an original to be copied is an original having a specific pattern; and means for controlling an output of copying on the basis of an output of the determining means.
      <br/>
      For instance, if the original to be copies is a banknote or an negotiable instrument, detection is carried out to that effect and image processing is controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Another object of the present invention is to provide an image processing apparatus which effects suitable processing not only when an image utterly identical with a predetermined image but also an image similar to the specified image are input, thereby preventing forgery.</p>
    <p num="11">
      According to this aspect of the invention, there is provided an image processing apparatus comprising: input means for inputting information on an image; evaluating means for evaluating on the basis of a specified standard to what extent an input image is similar to a predetermined image; and conversion processing means for providing predetermined conversion processing to the input information on an image in correspondence with the evaluation of the evaluating means.
      <br/>
      Thus, a reproduced image is modified in accordance with whether it is an image of a bill or a stock.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Still another object of the present invention is to provide an image processing apparatus which is capable of improving the accuracy of a determination as to whether or not an input image is a predetermined image, and of minimizing the frequency at which faults occur due to mistaken determinations.</p>
    <p num="13">A further object of the present invention is to provide a novel copying apparatus which has not heretofore existed.</p>
    <p num="14">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

    <p num="25">FIG. 4 illustrates an example of a control procedure in accordance with this embodiment, and the operation of the above-described arrangement will be described with reference to this drawing.</p>
    <p num="26">First, if a power switch (not shown) is turned on, the CPU 1 executes a predetermined initializing routine (Step S1), and is set on standby for receiving a command from the keyboard 4 after the temperature of the fixing rollers 88 reaches a predetermined level (Step S3).</p>
    <p num="27">
      When the operator instructs a copying operation by using the keyboard 1, the CPU 1 drives the image reading means 6 to read out an image of the original (Step S5).
      <br/>
      The reading of this image is effected four times by changing over a color filter, and is developed in the image memory 7 for each color (yellow, magenta, cyan and black).
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Subsequently, the bill detecting means 9 is operated, and a determination is made as to whether or not the image data on the image memory 7 is that of a bill or a stock certificate (Step S7).
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, for instance, if the address of a readable area of the original table 64 corresponds to that of a storage area on the image memory 7, the determination can be effected by recognizing the size of the original on the basis of the size of a data development area on the image memory 7 and by comparing its result with the sizes of bills and the like stored in advance in the ROM 2 and the like.
      <br/>
      In addition, this determination can also be effected by comparing the distribution of color spectra of the original with data registered in advance.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      If the size of the original corresponds to the size of a bill or the like, the bill detecting means 9 outputs "1", and, if not, it outputs "0" (Step S9).
      <br/>
      If this output is "0", the CPU 1 outputs the image on the image memory 7 as a color image by means of the image output means 8 (Step S11).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the output is "1", the CPU 1 prohibits the outputting of an image (Step S13).
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In the image outputting processing (Step S11), image formation is carried out on the basis of a known electrostatic process.
      <br/>
      In other words, after the photosensitive drum 86 is charged with the primary charger 81, the LED array 82 is turned on and off in correspondence with the image data in synchronism with the rotation of the photosensitive drum 86, thereby forming an electrostatic latent image.
      <br/>
      This electrostatic latent image is developed by the developing device 83 by means of a developer (toner or the like) and is transferred by the transfer charger 84 onto the copy paper 810 fed by the pickup roller 87.
      <br/>
      The output of a color image is realized by effecting the above-described process for each of yellow, magenta, cyan and black.
      <br/>
      Upon completion of development of the specified colors, the copy paper 810 is conveyed to the fixing rollers 88 by means of the conveyor belt 816 so as to effect thermal fixing and is then discharged onto the discharged-paper tray 89.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      On the other hand, in the processing in Step S13, the CPU 1 does not start the image output means 8, so that copying is prohibited and an output is not delivered.
      <br/>
      In other words, if the original is a bill or the like, the outputting of an image is prohibited.
      <br/>
      In addition, an arrangement may be provided such that display of a predetermined error message or an alarm using speech is provided in connection with this processing.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In order to ensure that the outputting of an image of the bill or the like is thus ultimately prohibited, in addition to prohibiting the operation of the image output means 8 as described above, the prohibition may be carried out before then.
      <br/>
      For instance, the scanning of the surface of the original is conducted four times, i.e., for each color, and if the feature of the original, such as the size of the original, becomes clear in that process, subsequent readings may be prohibited at that point of time, thereby prohibiting the outputting of an image.
    </p>
    <p num="33">In addition, an arrangement may be alternatively provided such that the outputting is prohibited after the copying operation by the image outputting means 8.</p>
    <p num="34">As described above in detail, in accordance with this embodiment, if a determination is made that the image is a specified one, the outputting of the image is prohibited, so that it is possible to prevent the forgery of a bill or the like.</p>
    <p num="35">
      FIG. 5 illustrates a second embodiment of the present invention for prohibiting the outputting after a copying operation.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the copy paper on which image formation is carried out once is not delivered to the outside, but is internally disposed of by cutting or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      FIG. 5 schematically illustrates an arrangement of an essential part of this embodiment.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, regardless of the type of original, the process proceeds to the transfer of image onto the copy paper shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Then, if the output of the image detecting means 9 is "0", the conveyor belt 816 is set in the position indicated by the solid line in FIG. 5, and the copy paper 810 is conveyed by the conveyor belt 816 to the fixing rollers 88 where and the copy paper 810 is subjected to thermal fixing and then discharged onto the discharged-paper tray 89.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, if the output of the image detecting means 9 is "1", i.e., if the original was a bill or the like, the conveyor belt 816 is set in the position indicated by the broken line in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      Then, the copy paper 810 which has been fed passes through a guide 100 and is conveyed to a cutter 101 where it is disposed of by being cut into fine pieces, making it impossible to obtain an output of copying.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Accordingly, in accordance with this embodiment, before reproduced image for forging is delivered outside the apparatus, the copy paper is disposed of, thereby making it possible to prevent the forging of a bill or the like.</p>
    <p num="38">
      In the foregoing embodiments, as a means of controlling the output of copying, the operation of the image output means 8 is prohibited, or the discharge thereof is prohibited.
      <br/>
      However, an arrangement may be provided such that the operation of the image output means 8 itself is controlled in such a manner that the copy of a bill or the like will be unusable.
    </p>
    <p num="39">FIG. 6 illustrates an example of a control procedure in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention for making a copy of a bill or the like unusable.</p>
    <p num="40">In this embodiment, processing by means of Steps S23 and S25 is provided instead of Step S13 in FIG. 4.</p>
    <p num="41">
      In other words, if the bill detecting means 9 detects a bill, a stock or the like and outputs "1", the CPU 1 calculates a logical sum of images of yellow, magenta and cyan and an image of black, and converts the images of yellow, magenta and cyan to that of black (Step S23).
      <br/>
      Then, the CPU 1 outputs an image by the image output means 8 as a monochromatic image (Step S25).
    </p>
    <p num="42">Thus, by outputting a monochromatic image, it becomes impossible for the operator who attempts to engage in a forging act to engage in the act by simply using a copying apparatus.</p>
    <p num="43">
      Although, in this embodiment, it is assumed that copying in black is effected as an output of a monochromatic image, it is also possible to effect monochromatic copying in yellow, magenta or cyan.
      <br/>
      More specifically, control of the image output means 8 in any form is possible insofar as it is ensured that at least a faithful full-color copy is not produced.
      <br/>
      In addition, if, when a bill or the like is detected before completion of the reading scanning described above, copying is effected with the contents stored in the memory 7 up until then, full-color copying will not be effected, so that this procedure is equally effective.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Although, in the foregoing embodiments, detection as to whether or not the original being copied is a bill or the like is conducted on the basis of a document size, it goes without saying that such detection may be effected by using any form of means.</p>
    <p num="45">
      For instance, means used in automatic vending machines and the like for reading a magnetic pattern of a part or the whole of a bill may be provided so as to compare that pattern with a pattern stored in advance.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is possible to provide an arrangement in which a magnetic head is provided in the original cover provided on the original table 64 for covering the original 69.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, in the case of a copying apparatus having an automatic delivery feeder (ADF) for originals, it is possible to adopt an arrangement in which a magnetic head is provided in its conveying passage.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In addition, it is also possible to adopt an arrangement in which a part or the whole of the image pattern of a bill or the like is read, and the read pattern is compared with a pattern which has been stored in advance.
      <br/>
      As for this reading, in the case of an apparatus having the configuration of a digital copier such as the one described above, the reading operation of the image reading means 6 may be used as it is.
      <br/>
      In the case of the other types of apparatus, the reading head may be provided on the original cover or conveying passage of an ADF or the like.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the illumination means may be provided on the original cover, and a comparison may be effected by reading a watermark pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The present invention can be applied irrespective of the form of the image output means 8.
      <br/>
      For instance, although an arrangement is adopted in which an LED array is used in the above-described embodiments so as to form an electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum, an arrangement may be alternatively adopted in which a laser beam or the like is used.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the means of forming an electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum is not confined to such electrophotographic type, but various other types may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      As described above, in accordance with the third embodiment of the present invention, if an attempt is made to copy an object the copying of which is prohibited, such as a bill or a stock, detection of that fact is carried out, and an output of copying is controlled appropriately, making it impossible for the operator to effect desired faithful but illegal copying.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is an advantage in that the act of forgery can be prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Particularly in this embodiment, the color original is output by being converted into a monochrome image, it is possible to ascertain what the original image was like.
      <br/>
      In other words, when the operator's purpose in copying the stock is not forgery but, for instance, to preserve as a document, that object can be attained.

      Strictly speaking, the VIDEO signal 514 is transmitted in synchronism with HSYNC 515.
      <br/>
      This arrangement is adopted because, since the signal BD 512, which is produced in synchronism with the rotation of the polygonal mirror 712, contains in large amounts the jitter of the motor for rotating the polygonal mirror 712, if the VIDEO signal 514 is synchronized with the BD signal as it is, jitter would occur in the image, so that HSYNC 515 is required which is produced in synchronism with jitter-free VCLK on the basis of the BD signal.

      SRCOM is a signal line for semi-double bilateral serial communication.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 9C, a command CM is transmitted in synchronism with an 8-bit serial clock SCLK during the transmission of a synchronous signal CBUSY (command busy) sent from the reader.
      <br/>
      In response, a status signal ST is returned in synchronism with an 8-bit serial clock occurring during the transmission of SBUSY (status busy) sent from the printer.
      <br/>
      All the exchanges of information including commands from the reader to the printer, such as the color mode and the selection of a cassette, information on the status of the printer, such as jamming, paper shortage, wait, etc., are conducted via this communication line SRCOM.

      FIG. 9A shows a timing chart for transmitting one four-color (full-color) image on the basis of ITOP and HSYNC.

      ITOP 511 is produced once during one rotation or two rotations of the transfer drum 716.
      <br/>
      At a timing 1, data of a yellow image is transmitted from the reader 401 to the printer 402.
      <br/>
      Similarly, data of a magenta image is transmitted at a timing 2, that of a cyan image at a timing 3, and that of a black image at a timing 4.
      <br/>
      Thus, a full-color image is formed on the copy paper with four colors superposed thereon.
      <br/>
      If, for instance, the image density in the feeding direction is assumed to be 16 pel/mm with respect to 420 mm in the longitudinal direction of an A3-size image HSYNC is transmitted 420 * 16=6,720 times.
      <br/>
      At the same time, this signal is output to a clock input for a timer circuit 428 provided in the controller circuit 413, which is adapted to supply an interruption HINT 517 to the CPU 422 after the lapse of a predetermined count.
      <br/>
      Thus, the CPU 422 effects image control in the feeding direction, such as withdrawal and movement.

    <p num="73">Referring now to FIG. 10, a description will be given of the operation of a bill-stock-feature extracting circuit 452.</p>
    <p num="74">
      FIG. 10 is a block diagram illustrating an example of the configuration of the video processing unit 412 including the bill-stock-feature extracting circuit 452.
      <br/>
      The color image signal read by the exposure scanning unit 411 shown in FIG. 7 is input from an amplification circuit 407 to the video processing unit 412 via the signal line 501.
      <br/>
      In this video processing unit 412, that input is received by a video receiver circuit 460, and the misregistration of each color and shading are corrected by a video preprocessing circuit 461 so as to output r, g, b signals.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The preprocessed video signal is input to the bill-stock-feature extracting circuit 452, and after being converted from a luminance signal into a density signal by a LOG conversion circuit 462, the signal is subjected to masking and under-color removal (UCR) by a masking/UCR circuit 463.
      <br/>
      Then, the signal is transmitted to the color printer 402 via the following: an italic image/mirror image processing circuit 464, a color balance circuit 465, a color conversion circuit 466, a magnification conversion circuit 467, a texture processing circuit 468, an edge emphasis smoothing circuit 469, a video signal synthesization circuit 470, and a video driver circuit 471, and then via a signal line VIDEO 8.
    </p>
    <p num="76">The processing circuit provided in the video processing unit 412 are connected to each other via an internal bus VUBUS and are further connected to the CPU 422 via a CPU bus transceiver 472 and a signal line 508.</p>
    <p num="77">In the bill-stock-feature extracting circuit 452, on the basis of the r, g, b signals that are input into it, a determination is made as to whether or not the input data matches with the features of a predetermined bill or stock, and a determining result thereof is returned to the CPU 422 via the VUBUS.</p>
    <p num="78">
      On the basis of a determining result with respect to a number of features, the CPU 422 makes a final determination as to whether or not the original being examined is a bill or stock.
      <br/>
      If the answer is YES, the CPU 422 sets a conversion parameter for a specific processing circuit via the VUBUS, the parameter being such that it will not allow a faithful image of the original to be reproduced.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      As for the processing of a determination on the matching effected by the bill-stock-feature extracting circuit 452, the determination may be made with respect to the input signals r, g, and b by making a comparison with data on the distribution of color spectra of the original registered in advance in a ROM or the like, or by comparing a pattern of a part or the whole of the image of the original with pattern data registered in advance, or effecting such processings in combination.
      <br/>
      In addition to the extraction of features with respect to the contents of the image data that has been read, it is possible to provide other appropriate processing such as addition of a circuit or the like for determining the size, magnetic pattern, watermark pattern or the like of the original and to transmit such data to the CPU 422.

    <p num="80">
      FIG. 11 shows an example of parameter changing processing which is carried out by the CPU 422 on the basis of a determination on a number of features obtained from the above-described feature extracting circuit 452.

      This procedure can be stored in the ROM 423.

    <p num="81">
      First, in Step S101, various results of determination are input from the aforementioned circuit 452 and others.
      <br/>
      Then, a final determination is made on the basis of the input results as to whether or not the original being examined is a bill or a stock (Step S103).
      <br/>
      In accordance with that calculated result, a changing parameter is set in the processing circuit 463 and the like in Step S105.
    </p>
    <p num="82">A description will now be given of examples of implementing the details of parameter changing.</p>
    <p num="83">The following formulas (a) to (d) are examples of changing the color when a determination is made that the original being examined is a bill or a stock, and this processing is carried out by changing the parameters of masking and UCR with respect to the masking/UCR processing circuit 463.  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="84">
      Formula (a) is an example of usual masking, whereas, if the matrix �mij � is changed into that shown in formula (b), the color changes totally from that of the original, so that the recorded image cannot be used as a circulatable one as a bill or a stock.
      <br/>
      However, the contents of the stock can be recorded.
    </p>
    <p num="85">In addition, formula (c) is an example in which the image is printed in a specified color, while formula (d) is an example in which the image is printed in a black.</p>
    <p num="86">
      As described above, in accordance with this embodiment, even in the case where it is determined that the original is a bill or a stock, it is possible to produce a copy although it is not faithful to the original, but sufficient to ascertain the contents described therein.

      Thus, it is possible to preserve the contents of the stock as a record.

      FIG. 12 illustrates a fifth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the drawing, reference numeral 450-2 denotes a bill-stock determining circuit, and in this example a CPU is provided so as to effect control in correspondence with the determination of a bill or the like.

      A signal 480 is adapted to control a color which is output to the masking/UCR processing circuit.

    <p num="89">
      In the case where a usual copying operation is carried out, as shown at (a) in FIG. 13, the masking/UCR processing circuit 463 is controlled in such a manner that VIDEO 8 is changed over in the order of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black in synchronism with the iTOP signal output from the printer 402.
      <br/>
      When it is determined in the bill-stock determining circuit 450-2 that the original is a bill or a stock, the color of the printed image is changed by changing the order of the changing over of the colors, as shown at (b) in FIG. 13.
    </p>
    <p num="90">Thus, since the masking/UCR processing circuit is controlled directly from the bill-stock determining circuit 450-2, it is possible to effect processing for changing the color independently of the CPU 422, so that the program of the CPU 422 does not become complicated, and, even if the program of the CPU 422 is altered, the prevention of forgery can be effected more positively.</p>

If a determination is made that the original is a bill or a stock, the CPU bus transceiver 472 is closed to exclusively use the VUBUS, and if, for instance, a specific parameter is written in the italic image/mirror image processing circuit 464, it is possible to print an italic image, as shown at (a) in FIG. 15.</p>
    <p num="93">If such a conversion is carried out forcedly, a printed image which can be distinguished clearly from an authentic one is output, thereby making it possible to prevent forgery.</p>

    <p num="95">
      In addition, the color balance may be changed substantially by controlling the color balance processing circuit 465.

      Alternatively, an image may be output in a specific color (monochrome) by controlling the color conversion circuit 466, or a monotone image may be output by controlling the color conversion circuit 466.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, an image may be output in the form of mosaic texture by controlling the texture processing circuit 468, or fine lines may be deleted through filtering or blurring processing may be effected by controlling the edge emphasis smoothing processing circuit 469.
      <br/>
      Moreover, an image may be output by being subjected to negative-positive conversion by controlling the LOG conversion circuit 462.

    <p num="97">FIG. 16 is a diagram illustrating a seventh embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="98">In this embodiment, in the feature extracting circuit 452, the CPU 422 calculates the degree of the "likelihood of being a bill or a stock", and sets a conversion parameter for a specific processing circuit in correspondence with the degree of the "likelihood of being a bill or a stock".</p>
    <p num="99">Since the processing of a matching determination carried out by the feature extracting circuit 452 is identical with that shown in FIG. 7, a description thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="100">
      Specifically, FIG. 16 illustrates an example of a parameter conversion processing procedure carried out by the CPU 422 on the basis of a number of evaluations obtained from the above-described feature extracting circuit 452.
      <br/>
      This procedure can be stored in the ROM 423.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      First, in Step S111, various evaluations (determining results) are input from the aforementioned circuit 452 and others.
      <br/>
      Then, in Step S113, an appropriate calculation is performed on the basis of the evaluations, and a determination is made on the degree or extent of the "likelihood of being a bill or a stock certificate" (the evaluations constitute an array which may be simply a collection of numbers used in actual computations, or the array may be used to address the contents of a look-up table in ROM 423, and this array is sometimes hereinafter termed a "non-binary-number" to indicate that it could be anything ranging from a collection of several numbers, to a single value chosen on a (non-binary) scale, to an array of several different types of values).
      <br/>
      In Step S115, conversion parameters are determined in correspondence with that calculated result, and are set in the processing circuit 463 or the like.
      <br/>
      Not only the aforementioned degree or extent evaluations but also the conversion parameters can be formatted in advance as tables in the ROM 423.
    </p>
    <p num="102">A description will now be given of an example of the contents of parameters to be converted.</p>
    <p num="103">The following formulae (e) and (f) are examples in which the color is changed in correspondence with the degree of the likelihood of being a bill or a stock certificate, and this processing is effected by changing masking/UCR parameters for the masking/UCR processing circuit 463.  (Equation image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="104">
      Formula (e) is an example of usual masking, and if matrix �mij � is changed into that shown in formula (f), the color is output by being converted in correspondence of the value of a which is determined by the degree of the likelihood of the original being a bill or a stock.
      <br/>
      Consequently, when  ALPHA  is large, the reproduced color changes totally from that of the original, so that the reproduced copy cannot be used as a circulatable one as a bill or a stock.
      <br/>
      However, the contents (number or the like) given in the stock can be preserved as a record.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, with respect to an original image whose degree of likelihood of being a bill or a stock is low, the change in color is suppressed to a small level by making a small.
      <br/>
      It goes without saying that other methods may be used as the method of changing the color.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      As described above, in accordance with the seventh embodiment of the present invention, since the image conversion is effected in correspondence with the degree of the likelihood of the original being a bill or a stock, it is possible to form an image having a certain degree of picture quality even with respect to an original for which a determination is difficult.
      <br/>
      Hence, the amount of copies for which a determination of an "erroneous copy" is made can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="106">FIG. 17 illustrates an eighth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="107">
      In the drawing, a bill-stock determining circuit is designated at 450-2, and in this embodiment, the arrangement is such that a CPU is provided to effect control in correspondence with the degree of the "likelihood of the original being a bill or a stock certificate".
      <br/>
      A signal line 488 is adapted to control the degree of an italic image with respect to the italic image/mirror image processing circuit 464.
    </p>
    <p num="108">In conversion into an italic image, the configuration of the image is deformed as shown in FIG. 18. By virtue of the processing by the circuit 450-2, control can be effected via a signal 488 in such that manner that  THETA  is set increasingly close to 0 (degree)  from 90 (degree)  in correspondence with the degree of the likelihood of the original being a bill or a stock.</p>
    <p num="109">
      Thus, in this embodiment, since the italic image/mirror image processing circuit 464 is controlled directly by the bill-stock determining circuit 450-2 to a degree corresponding to the degree of the likelihood of the original being a bill or a stock certificate, the forgery preventing processing can be effected independently of the CPU 422.
      <br/>
      Hence, the program of the CPU 422 does not become complicated, and it makes it still more difficult for the would-be forger to obviate the forgery-preventing processing.

      <br/>
      If it is determined that the original is likely a bill or a stock, the CPU bus transceiver 472 is closed, and exclusively the VUBUS is used.
      <br/>
      Then, for instance, if specific parameters are written in the italic image/mirror image processing circuit 464, it is possible to print an italic image, as shown in FIG. 18.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      Since such a conversion is effected to a degree corresponding to the degree of the original the likelihood of being a bill or a stock, when a determination is made that the original is obviously a bill or a stock (when the degree of likelihood is large), a printed image which can be clearly distinguished from an authentic one is output, thereby making it possible to prevent forgery.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the determination is not clear-cut (the degree of probability is small, the conversion is effected at a small degree, with the result that the possibility of imparting unexpected trouble to the operator is small.

      In addition, FIG. 20 (b) is also an example in which an image is output by being subjected to lateral longitudinal independent magnification in correspondence with the degree of the original the likelihood of being a bill or a stock.

      A comparator 2116 compares the output of the D/A converter 2114 with a triangle wave signal of a predetermined period produced from a triangle wave generator 2115, obtaining a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal having a pulse width proportional to the image signal.

    <p num="135">A determining circuit 2127 determines whether or not the pattern on the original 2101 is a specified pattern, and is controlled by the CPU 2128.</p>
    <p num="136">In the above-described arrangement, four executions of scanning and reading are necessary with respect to the original 2101 in synchronism with the C, M, Y, and K outputs of the printer, and the selector 2112 changes over the output signals and sends to the printer signals corresponding to C, M, Y, or K. In this embodiment, therefore, the arrangement is such that the determining circuit 2127 is operated by a different algorithm in correspondence with a plurality of times of the original scanning operation, and its determining results are evaluated in a comprehensive manner, thereby improving the accuracy with which a specific pattern is determined.</p>
    <p num="137">
      Referring now to FIG. 27, a detailed description will be given of the operation of the above-described determining circuit 2127.
      <br/>
      FIG. 27 illustrates a detailed internal circuit configuration of the determining circuit 2127.
      <br/>
      The R, G, and B signals from the shading correction circuit 2108 shown in FIG. 26 are respectively subjected to binary processing by comparators 2201-2203 in the light of predetermined threshold values from threshold value store 2204.
      <br/>
      An AND circuit 2205 calculates a logical product of the results of this binary processing, and outputs "1" only to the picture element which exceeds the threshold value with respect to all of R, G, and B.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      An edge point detection circuit 2206 detects an edge point of the image of the original, and, when, as shown in FIG. 28, a bill 2302, i.e., the original 2101, is placed on the original-mounting glass table 2102, this circuit 2206 detects an edge point on one side of the bill 2302 (a point on a straight line 2303).
      <br/>
      An angle detection circuit 2207 detects a rotating angle  THETA  (see FIG. 28) of the bill 2302 on the basis of the result of detection by the edge point detection circuit 2206.
      <br/>
      An affine conversion circuit 2208 cuts off a part (e.g., a hatched portion indicated at 2304 in FIG. 28) of an input image of the original on the basis of the detection result  THETA  of the angle detection circuit 2207 and effects rotation by (- THETA ) so as to be written in a memory 2209.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      By virtue of the above-described arrangement, an image is written in a memory 2209 in the state in which the cut-out portion 2304 is not rotated.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, a normal image pattern corresponding to the aforementioned cut-out portion 2304 is written in a memory 2210 from the CPU 2128.
      <br/>
      Then, the contents of the memory 2209 and the contents of the memory 2210 are superposed on each other in a matching circuit 2211, and a value of their correlation is determined.
      <br/>
      The value of correlation determined by the matching circuit 2211 is output again to the CPU 2128, where, on the basis of the value of correlation, a determination is made as to whether or not the input image coincides with a normal image pattern (hereinafter referred to as the normal pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      In the above-described operation, there is clearly an uncertainty of  +- 180 (degree)  in angle detection in the angle detection circuit 2207, so that a single calculation of matching does not lead to a proper determination with respect to an image inverted by 180 (degree) . For this reason, in this embodiment, if an upright proper pattern is written in the memory 2210 in the first scanning of the original, while an inverted (180 (degree)  inverted) proper pattern is written therein in the second scanning of the original, the 180 (degree)  uncertainly can be overcome in two scanning and determining operations.
      <br/>
      Namely, in FIG. 26, the first scanning and determination are made to correspond to the outputting of a cyan image, while the second scanning and determination are made to correspond to the outputting of a magenta image, and if a determination is made on the basis of either of the two determining results that the input image coincides with the proper pattern, the CPU 2128 immediately turns off the gate circuit 2113, cutting off an output of the image signal to the printer.
      <br/>
      By virtue of this arrangement, since at least the yellow image and the black image are not written onto the photosensitive drum 2121, the duplicated image outputted to the copy paper can be clearly discriminated from the input original, making it possible to suit the purpose of forgery prevention.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      Referring now to FIG. 27, a description will be given of a modification of this embodiment.
      <br/>
      In this modification, the above-described uncertainty concerning 180 (degree)  can be over me at one time by the provision of two systems of the circuit having a configuration such as the one shown in FIG. 27. Furthermore, the reading density is changed for the first scanning and the second scanning.
      <br/>
      Namely, during the first reading scanning, an image thinned out for each other picture element in the affine conversion circuit 2208 is written in the memory 2209, while, during the second reading scanning, the image is not thinned out and is written in the memory 2209 as it is with the density which has been read.
      <br/>
      Proper patterns corresponding to respective densities are written in advance in the memory 2210.
      <br/>
      By virtue of this arrangement, even in cases where it is impossible to obtain a value of sufficient correlation during the first matching, if a value of high correlation can be obtained during the second matching, the CPU 2128 can determine that the input image has coincided with the proper pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="142">As the other embodiments, the following various types are conceivably adopted:</p>
    <p num="143">Threshold values supplied to the comparators 2201 and the 2203 shown in FIG. 27 are varied during the first and second scannings.</p>
    <p num="144">An image to be written in the memory 2209 shown in FIG. 27 is shifted by the portion of a number of picture elements during the first and second scannings, thereby absorbing the misregistration between the input pattern and the proper pattern.</p>
    <p num="145">
      The proper pattern to be written in the memory 2210 shown in FIG. 27 is varied during the first and second scannings.
      <br/>
      For instance, the pattern of a ten thousand yen note is used during the first scanning, while the pattern is changed to the pattern of a thousand yen note during the second scanning.
    </p>
    <p num="146">
      In the foregoing embodiment, it goes without saying that the number of scannings is not restricted to two.
      <br/>
      In addition, the number of scannings is not restricted to four times or less.
      <br/>
      For instance, the following processing is possible: If a determination is made during four or less scannings that the input image is close to a proper pattern, determination processing is continued by carrying out only the original scanning without discharging the copy paper from the transfer drum 2123, and the fifth transfer is effected when the input image coincides with the proper pattern, whereupon the overall surface of the duplicated copy is inked out.
    </p>
    <p num="147">A description will now be given of another modification of the twelfth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="148">
      In this modification, an image is not output during the determining process of the first scanning, and if it is determined in this process that the original is close to a proper pattern of a bill or the like, scanning is stopped at that point of time.
      <br/>
      When it is not determined that the original is close to the proper pattern, four readings of images corresponding to C, M, Y, and K are continuously made and outputs of video signals are delivered to the printer, outputting a duplicated image.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      When the scanning is suspended, a message is output from the CPU 2128 to a liquid crystal display 2130 or the like to the effect that the operator should rearrange the original or take other appropriate step, thereby prompting a restart.
      <br/>
      When a restart is designated by the operator through a key 2131, the determining and duplication processing such as those described above are restarted.
    </p>
    <p num="150">By virtue of this arrangement, it is possible to overcome faults in determination caused by a slight mispositioning of the original, angular errors thereof, etc.</p>
    <p num="151">The above-described method of determining a specific image by abstracting a specific pattern can be applied to all of the above-described embodiments.</p>
    <p num="152">
      As described above, in accordance with the twelfth embodiment of the present invention, the operation of effecting a determination by extracting a specific pattern from an image of the original is repeated a plurality of times, and the results of the repeated determinations are evaluated in a comprehensive manner, a final determination is made as to whether or not a specific pattern is included in the image of the original.
      <br/>
      Hence, it is possible to obtain the following advantages: The accuracy with which the determination is made is improved substantially, and the forgery preventing function of the color image copying apparatus is enhanced.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the possibility of hindering normal copying operations can be reduced to a remarkable degree.
    </p>
    <p num="153">The present invention is not restricted to the above-described embodiments, and various other modifications are possible without departing from the spirit of the invention which is solely defined in the appended claims.</p>
