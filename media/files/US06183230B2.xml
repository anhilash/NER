      <br/>
      An oil pump drive assembly for an internal combustion engine includes a source of rotational input such as a crankshaft and a splined hub mounted to the crankshaft for rotation therewith.
      <br/>
      The splined hub has male splines extending about the outer perimeter to transfer rotational load to drive an oil pump.
      <br/>
      The oil pump includes a pump body housing a gerotor pump set, which includes an internally lobed pumping annulus and a pump rotor.
      <br/>
      The pump rotor has lobes along the outer surface to engage the internally lobed pumping annulus and female splines along the inner surface which compliment and receive the male splines of the splined hub for meshing engagement to operatively connect the crankshaft and the gerotor pump set.
      <br/>
      The oil pump further includes a splined isolator ring disposed between the pump rotor and the splined hub wherein the inner periphery of the isolator ring is configured for meshing engagement with the male splines of the splined hub and the outer periphery of the isolator ring is configured for meshing engagement with the female splines of the pump rotor.
      <br/>
      The splined isolator ring operates to minimize noise generation upon impacts between the splined hub of the crankshaft and the pump rotor.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention is directed to an engine oil pump and drive assembly.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The gerotor pump has emerged as a preferred means of providing lubrication for internal combustion engines attributable to its efficiency and packaging benefits.
      <br/>
      The pump is placed on center with the crankshaft axis and is generally driven by a coarse splined hub mounted on the crankshaft.
      <br/>
      The crankshaft's coarse splined hub extends through a central opening in the pump's rotor to engage female splines of the pump rotor, transferring rotational energy therebetween.
      <br/>
      Adequate clearance within the spline drive is required because tight tolerances impede assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      As the gerotor oil pump has become more common place in the field, unsatisfactory noise levels have been observed.
      <br/>
      Root causing the source unveiled noise introduced as a result of longitudinal crankshaft flexure during high engine loading.
      <br/>
      This longitudinal bending imparts a radial impact between the top flat of the male spline and the receiving female spline surface.
      <br/>
      Torsional shaft deflections also occur, causing tangential impacts between the radial faces of mating male and female splines.
      <br/>
      In addition, large tolerances between the mating splines generate a rattling noise from torsional spline-to-spline impacts at lower engine speeds due to pump pressure pulsations and instantaneous engine speed fluctuations.
      <br/>
      Simply increasing the clearance between the splines eliminates crankshaft motion-induced noise but aggravates drive "rattle".
      <br/>
      Resolving noise concerns will increase customer satisfaction with the engine package.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      To resolve the discovered noise source concern, the present invention provides a pump drive system which can accommodate motion of the crankshaft, relative to the pump, without generating gear impact noise.
      <br/>
      An isolator is interposed between the pump rotor and the driving splined hub to minimize noise generation upon impact of the male splines with the female splines.
      <br/>
      All faces, arc and radial, of the splines are isolated to absorb radial impacts as well as tangential impacts.
      <br/>
      This isolator provides a forgiving system which accommodates crankshaft flexure and torsion without resulting noise.
      <br/>
      In addition, the system maintains the fail-safe feature inherent in a spline drive system because if the isolator should deteriorate, the splines will still engage to drive the pump.

      <br/>
      The pump body 22 is provided with appropriate inlet and outlet ports for oil to be circulated by the pump 14.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 3, the pump body houses a gerotor pump set 28 which includes a pump rotor 30 and a pumping annulus 40.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The pump rotor 30 is placed on center with the longitudinal crankshaft axis 20 and receives the splined hub 16 of the crankshaft 12.
      <br/>
      The pump rotor 30 has female splines 32 along the inner surface which compliment the male splines 18 of the splined hub 16 for meshing engagement.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 5, each of the female splines 32 of the pump rotor 30 is defined by two radially extending faces 34 with an arc face 36 extending therebetween.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Along the outer surface of the pump rotor 30, there are lobes 38 to engage the annulus lobes 39 of the internally lobed pumping annulus 40 as illustrated in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The non-meshing lobes 38,39 define chambers 41 therebetween.
      <br/>
      As the rotor 30 and pumping annulus 40 turn relative to each other, oil is drawn into the chambers 41 as the chamber size increases and is expelled through the outlet port as the chamber size diminishes.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      FIG. 4 illustrates a splined isolator ring 42 disposed between the pump rotor 30 and the splined hub 16 of the crankshaft 12.
      <br/>
      The inner periphery of the isolator ring 42 is configured for meshing engagement with the male splines 18 of the splined hub 16.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 6, the outer periphery of the isolator ring 42 is defined by radial walls 44 and arc walls 46 extending between the radial walls which compliment the radially extending faces 34 and arc faces 36 respectively of pump rotor 30, for slip fit meshing engagement therewith.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Alternatively, the splined isolator ring 42 may be integrally fixed such as by overmolding on to either the pump rotor 30 or the splined hub 16.
      <br/>
      Where the splined isolator ring 42 is overmolded as an integral part of the pump rotor 30, the female splines 32 would be considered isolated, i.e. isolatable female splines.
      <br/>
      An integrally supplied isolator provides ease of assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The material selected for the splined isolator ring may be a compliant material such as a nitrile rubber or a less compliant material such as Nylon, Teflon, or a phenolic.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the material selected have oil resistance properties.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      To activate the pump 14, the source of rotational input such as the crankshaft 12 rotates the splined hub 16, which in turn rotates the pump rotor 30 by meshing engagement of the mating male and female splines 18,32.
      <br/>
      This configuration operatively connects the rotational input and the gerotor pump.
      <br/>
      The splined isolator ring 42 operates to "cushion" bending-induced impacts of the male splines against the arc faces 36 and twisting-induced impacts of the male splines 18 against the radially extending faces 34 of the pump rotor female splines 32.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the splined isolator ring 42 minimizes noise generation that may be generated from metal to metal impacts of the splines 18,32.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The splined isolator ring may also be used with other style oil pumps driven by the crankshaft such as a crescent gear pump.
      <br/>
      However it is the extremely close internal tolerances of the gerotor pump and its geometric relationship to the crankshaft centerline that creates the likelihood of drive spline impacts.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      It is anticipated that the isolator ring would not reduce the failsafe feature inherent in a spline drive system.
      <br/>
      If the isolator material degraded, the male and female splines would still engage to operate the engine oil pump without the risk of engine inoperation.
