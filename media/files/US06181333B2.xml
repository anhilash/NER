    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to television (TV) systems, and in particular, to a novel TV graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to arrange TV channels and programs in a prescribed order.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The growing availability of TV broadcast and interactive services creates a need for a new type of a TV control system that would facilitate user access to options offered by TV program providers.
      <br/>
      For example, direct broadcast satellite services require users to make their selection among about a thousand TV channels with various TV programs and services.
      <br/>
      Direct television satellite broadcasting is provided via direct broadcast satellites at an uplink frequency of 17.3 to 17.9 GHz and a downlink frequency of 12.2 to 12.7 Ghz.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A digital satellite television system for direct television broadcasting includes a transmitter for transmitting television signals including video and audio components to a satellite.
      <br/>
      The satellite retransmits the received television signals to an outdoor antenna assembly that includes a dish-like antenna and a block converter.
      <br/>
      The dish-like antenna directs the received television signals to the block converter that converts the frequencies of the received television signals to respective lower frequencies.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The television signals produced by the block converter are connected via a coaxial cable to an indoor satellite receiver coupled to a TV set.
      <br/>
      The satellite receiver tunes, demodulates and otherwise processes the received television signals to provide video and audio signals with a NTSC, PAL or SECAM format suitable for processing by the TV set that produces an image on a display screen in response to the video signals, and an audible response by means of speakers in response to the audio signals.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Within the transmitter, analog video and audio signals are converted to respective digital signals compressed according to the Motion Picture Expert Group (MPEG) encoding standard.
      <br/>
      The resultant digital signals are represented by a stream of packets including error correction data.
      <br/>
      The type of packets is identified by a header code.
      <br/>
      Packets corresponding to control data may also be added to the packet stream.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In the MPEG standard, the video information may be transmitted in the form of a luminance (Y) component and two color difference (U and V) components.
      <br/>
      For example, the first color difference component may represent the difference between the red image information and the luminance image information (R-Y), and the second color difference component may represent the difference between the blue image information and the luminance image information (B-Y).
      <br/>
      In addition, the color information is compressed because the two color difference components correspond to more than one picture element.
      <br/>
      The use of color difference components and the sharing of the color difference components between picture elements reduces the transmission bandwidth.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The digital information resulting from the compression and error correction encoding is modulated on a carrier using Quaternary Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation and transmitted to a satellite for retransmission.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The satellite receiver comprises a tuner for selecting the appropriate carrier signal retransmitted by the satellite and for converting the frequency of the selected carrier to an intermediate frequency (IF) signal.
      <br/>
      A QPSK demodulator demodulates the IF signal and supplies it to an error-correcting decoder to correct demodulated packets representing video and audio information.
      <br/>
      An MPEG decoder decodes and decompresses video and audio packets to form digital video and audio signals supplied to a TV set.
      <br/>
      A TV set-top box serves to deliver compressed digital video and audio signals in real time usable form to one or more TV sets.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A TV guide presenting a list of available channels and programs may be displayed on a TV screen to facilitate user access to TV programs and services.
      <br/>
      In conventional TV guides, TV channels are arranged in order of their numbers.
      <br/>
      However, as the digital satellite television system may provide about 1,000 TV channels with various TV programs and services, it may be difficult to find a required channel or program if a user does not know the number of the required channel, or the number of the channel that carries the required program.
      <br/>
      Thus, it would be desirable to sort TV channels and programs so as to present them in a manner that is easily searched and a desired program promptly located by a user.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Furthermore, it may be inconvenient for the user to adapt to various formats of channel or program lists.
      <br/>
      Thus, it would be desirable to present sorted TV channels and programs in a common format.
    </p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="29">
      The best mode for practicing the invention is based on the realization of a satellite receiver in a digital satellite television system.
      <br/>
      However, it is to be understood that the present invention is applicable to any system for receiving TV signals.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Reference is now made to FIG. 1 of the drawings wherein an indoor satellite receiver 300 includes an analog radio-frequency (RF) tuner 302 such as a satellite front end demodulator manufactured by Sharp/Comstream.
      <br/>
      The RF tuner 302 is coupled via an external UHF/VHF to an outdoor unit that receives incoming television signals from a satellite.
      <br/>
      The outdoor unit may comprise a 18" antenna made of aluminum and dual low noise block converters that convert satellite signals in a frequency range from 12.2-12.7 GHz received by the antenna into the 950-1450 Mhz frequency range signals.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The RF tuner 302 equipped with a local oscillator and mixer selects the appropriate carrier signal corresponding to a selected satellite TV channel from the 950-1450 Mhz signals received from the outdoor unit.
      <br/>
      The frequency of the selected carrier is converted to an intermediate frequency (IF) signal fed to an analog-digital converter 304 that produces a digital IF signal.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      A digital demodulator 306 performs QPSK demodulation of the digital IF signal and carries out multiple error correction algorithms required to decode error correction data contained in the received signal.
      <br/>
      For example, Viterbi and Reed-Solomon error correction algorithms may be employed.
      <br/>
      A single ASIC manufactured by Comstream may be used as the digital demodulator 306.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The decoded digital signal is fed to a transport chip 308 responsible for demultiplexing video, audio and data signals.
      <br/>
      The transport unit 308 is also connected to a card 310 for providing conditional access to the satellite receiver 300.
      <br/>
      The card 310, such as a Smart Card manufactured by the News Data Corporation, controls access to paid channels and services using the Data Encryption Standard (DES).
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Wideband data are fed to the transport unit 308 via a wideband port 312 that provides compatibility with 16:9 wide NTSC format.
      <br/>
      The wideband port is also controlled by the conditional access system.
      <br/>
      A buffer 314 is used to support the transport chip operations.
      <br/>
      A 128Kx8 static random-access memory (SRAM) with access speed of 70 ns may be used as the buffer 314.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The transport chip 308 routes the video and audio signals to an MPEG decoder 316, while data is made available to a CPU 318.
      <br/>
      The MPEG decoder 316 provides decompression of the video and audio signals in accordance with the MPEG standard.
      <br/>
      For example, a single-chip STi3520 MPEG decoder may be used.
      <br/>
      By way of example, reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,198,901 to Lynch of Mar. 30, 1993; to U.S. Pat. No. 5,293,229 to Iu of Mar. 8, 1994; to U.S. Pat. No. 5,311,310 to Jozawa et al. of May 10, 1994; to U.S. Pat. No. 5,361,105 to Iu of Nov. 1, 1994; to U.S. Pat. No. 5,386,234 to Veltman et al. of Jan. 31, 1995; and to U.S. Pat. No. 5,400,076 to Iwamura of Mar. 21, 1995. Those disclosures and citations referenced therein may be consulted for an understanding of the specific details of conventional MPEG decompression arrangements.
    </p>
    <p num="36">The MPEG decoder 316 of the preferred embodiment is supported by a synchronous RAM 320 formed by four 256K * 16 DRAMs with access speed of 70 ns capable of holding 3 full frames of MPEG video and audio data, and control information.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Decompressed video data in YUV format is fed to a digital video encoder 322.
      <br/>
      The decompressed audio data is supplied to the video encoder 322, and to a stereo audio digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 324 for converting digital audio signals into analog form.
      <br/>
      A single-chip AK4319 DAC, manufactured by Asahi Kasei, may be used as the DAC 324.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Operations of the satellite receiver 300 are supported by the CPU 318 such as a Motorola 68340 CPU chip running at 16 MHz.
      <br/>
      An external watch crystal is used to derive the 16 MHz internal clock.
      <br/>
      The CPU 318 may have a 16-bit external data bus and a 32-bit data bus for internal operations.
      <br/>
      The CPU 318 may run the PSOS+operating system developed by Integrated Systems Inc.
    </p>

      The ROM 324 that holds the PSOS+operating system, menus, fonts, and other fixed data may be formed by two 4 Mbit masked ROM chips organized as 512 K * 8 with access speed of 95 ns.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The SRAM 326 formed, for example, by two 1 Mbit SRAM chips organized as 128 K * 8 with access speed of 70 ns, may be used for storing all active data such as system stacks, variables, menu data, etc.
      <br/>
      The ROM 324 and SRAM 326 may operate at a zero wait state to provide maximum performance.
    </p>
    <p num="41">The EEPROM 328, for example, a single 8 K * 8 EEPROM chip with access speed of 150 ns, may store non-volatile data such as user preferences.</p>

      To enhance the graphics presentation capabilities of the satellite receiver 300, a graphics accelerator 330, such as a MCD212 graphics accelerator manufactured by Motorola, is used as a co-processor.
      <br/>
      The graphics accelerator 330 allows the receiver 300 to increase the rate of screen updates and to provide up to 256 colors in a graphics image.
      <br/>
      Also, the accelerator provides graphical effects such as wipes, dissolves, fades, etc. during transitions of menus on a TV screen, and supports operations of a remote pointing device such as an Airmouse.RTM.. This type of remote pointing device is manufactured by Seletech and Airmouse Remote Controls.
      <br/>
      The output of the graphics accelerator 330 produced in RGB format is fed to a converting circuit 332 for conversion into YUV format.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The graphics accelerator 330 may be supported by a synchronous 4 Mbit RAM 334 provided, for example, on a single 256 K * 16 DRAM chip with access speed of 70 ns.
      <br/>
      The RAM 334 used for storing graphics data is capable of storing two graphics planes with 720 * 480 pixel resolution.
      <br/>
      The graphics accelerator 330 allows two graphics planes to be combined to produce various graphical effects.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The graphics data from the conversion circuit 332, and decompressed video and audio data from the MPEG decoder 316, are supplied to separate inputs of the digital video encoder 322 such as a single-chip Phillips 7184 encoder.
      <br/>
      The video encoder 322 is responsible for encoding digital video, audio and graphics data to produce a combined composite signal in NTSC format.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,947 to Cooper of Feb. 6, 1996, incorporated herewith by reference, discloses an on-screen display (OSD) arrangement that allows the graphics data to be displayed on a TV set screen together with the image represented by the received video signals, or in place of this image.
      <br/>
      A single control bit may be used by the video encoder 322 to switch its output from graphics data to video and back.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The video encoder 322 also produces baseband video and audio signals.
      <br/>
      The baseband video signals are buffered by a pair of video operational amplifiers 336 coupled to video connectors.
      <br/>
      The baseband audio signals are fed to the stereo audio DAC 324 for converting to analog format and supplying to audio connectors.
      <br/>
      The video and audio connectors may be coupled to such external devices as stereo receivers, TVs or VCRs.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The combined composite signal from the video encoder 322 may be fed to a NTSC modulator 338 that modulates the composite signal to either channel 3 or 4 of a TV set coupled to the modulator 338.
      <br/>
      The modulator 338 also allows the combined composite signal to bypass a cable/antenna input of the TV set.

      The TV set coupled to the satellite receiver 300 may display graphics data representing a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows a user to control operations of the satellite receiver 300, and provides user access to services and options offered by the digital satellite TV system.
      <br/>
      For example, graphics on the TV set screen may represent a graphical channel changer that enables a user to select TV channels.
      <br/>
      Another example of a graphical presentation on the TV screen is an electronic program guide that contains names of TV programs arranged in a 2-dimensional array, in which TV channels are listed vertically, and the time of broadcasting is listed in the horizontal direction.

    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The pointing device interface 346 enables a remote optical pointing device such as an Airmouse.RTM. to provide a wireless control of the satellite receiver 300.

      <br/>
      For example, the pointing device interface 346 may comprise an infrared (IR) transmitter and receiver that provide infrared communications with a pointing device located up to 7 meters away from the receiver 300 at an angle of up to 45 degrees.
      <br/>
      This type of remote pointing device has been used principally for moving the cursor of a personal computer.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The Airmouse.RTM. type pointing device in accordance with the invention points directly at a TV set screen to provide direct interactions between the user hand that holds the pointing device, and the TV screen.

      Reference is now made to FIG. 2 that illustrates drawing color graphic objects on a TV screen accordingto the present invention.
      <br/>
      As discussed above, the CPU 318 interacts with the graphics accelerator 330 used as a coprocessor to enhance the graphics capability of the satellite receiver 300.
      <br/>
      The CPU 318 may be coupled to the graphics accelerator 330 via an external 24-bit address bus 402 and a 16-bit data bus 404.
      <br/>
      The 24-bit address bus 402 enables the CPU 318 to address up to 16 Mbytes of a graphics memory.
      <br/>
      This storage capacity corresponds to an address space from 000000 to ffffff in hexadecimal notation.
      <br/>
      Various graphics memory arrangements may be organized in this address space, as long as each memory location is uniquely addressable.
      <br/>
      For example, the capacity of the graphics memory 334 may be equal to 4 Mbit or 512 Kbytes.
      <br/>
      Assuming that the graphics memory address space corresponds to the middle part of the system memory map, the $800000 hex address may be selected as the lowest graphics memory location, and the $87ffff hex address may be designated as the top graphics memory address.
      <br/>
      The graphics memory 334 may be coupled to the graphics accelerator 330 via memory address lines 406 and memory data lines 408.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The graphics accelerator 330 enables a TV set to display up to 16 million different colors.
      <br/>
      However, only 256 different colors can be displayed on any one screen at any given time.
      <br/>
      As a result, each unique pixel displayable on a TV screen can be represented by a single 8-bit value.
      <br/>
      Thus, each pixel stored in the 512 Kbyte graphics memory 334 is represented by a single 8-bit value or byte.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Each graphics plane stored in the graphics memory 334 is provided by a rectangular array of 720 * 480 pixels representing a picture on the TV screen.
      <br/>
      For example, the pixels may be stored in the graphics memory 334 from top left to bottom right in row order.
      <br/>
      Thus, the top left hand pixel of the screen resides at the $800000 hex graphics memory location.
      <br/>
      The second pixel on the top line 1 is stored at $800001 hex, etc.
      <br/>
      The last pixel of the top line 1 is held at $8002D0 hex.
      <br/>
      The first pixel of the next line 2 is at the $8002D1 hex graphics memory location, etc.
      <br/>
      The bottom right hand corner of the screen corresponds to the $8545ff location of the graphics memory 334.
      <br/>
      Thus, the graphics memory arrangement corresponds to a rectangular X,Y-coordinate system on the TV screen, where 720 pixels in each line of the array are arranged in the horizontal direction X, and 480 pixels in each row of the array are arranged in the vertical direction Y.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The graphics accelerator 330 contains a color look up table (CLUT) that converts 256 elements representing 8-bit pixel values stored in the graphics memory 334 into 24-bit values composed of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) bytes corresponding to R, G, and B components of a picture in RGB format.
      <br/>
      The CLUT may be programmed by the CPU 318 to reproduce any color possible in a 24-bit color space.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      FIG. 3 illustrates some typical colors reproducible by the CLUT.
      <br/>
      For example, black color composed of red, green and blue bytes represented by $0 hex may correspond to the $0 hex location of the CLUT.
      <br/>
      White color composed of the $ff hex red, green and blue bytes may correspond to the $4 hex CLUT location, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      When the CLUT is programmed, the CPU 318 accesses the graphics memory 334 to write data values representing graphics.
      <br/>
      The graphics accelerator 330 scans the graphics memory 334 at a rate of 13.5 MHz to read the graphics data.
      <br/>
      Each 8-bit pixel value is transferred to the CLUT that converts it into a 24-bit color value in RGB format.
      <br/>
      As discussed above, the converter 332 converts the RGB color value into YUV format, and passes a 24-bit digital YUV value to the digital encoder 322 that converts it into analog NTSC luminance and chrominance signals, for example, at a 13.5 MHz rate.
      <br/>
      The NTSC encoding procedure carried out by the encoder 322 is well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      The analog luminance and chrominance signals via the TV modulator 338 are supplied to the TV set.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      FIG. 4 shows a flow chart that illustrates an example of interactions between the CPU 318 and graphics accelerator 330 to draw a 240 * 240 pixel red square in the middle of a TV screen with a black background.
      <br/>
      In step 602, the CPU 318 resets the graphic accelerator 330.
      <br/>
      In step 604, the CPU 318 programs the CLUT in the graphics accelerator 330 so as to set CLUT location $0 hex to reproduce black color, i.e. red, green and blue bytes in this location are set to $0 hex.
      <br/>
      In step 606, the CPU 318 sets CLUT location $1 hex to reproduce red color, i.e. a red byte in this location is set to $ff hex, and green and blue bytes are set to $0 hex.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      In steps 608 and 610, the CPU 318 carries out a loop to make the TV screen black.
      <br/>
      Locations $800000+I of the graphics memory 334 are set to $0 hex, for I that varies from $0 hex to $545ff hex.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      In steps 612-622, the CPU 318 performs a double loop to draw the red 240 * 240 pixel box on the screen.
      <br/>
      The double loop comprises an outer loop carried out to set pixels in rows (Y-direction on the screen) of the graphics memory 334 to $1 hex to reproduce them in red color, and an inner loop to set pixels in lines (X-direction) of the graphics memory 334 to $1 hex to reproduce them in red color.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      Graphical objects displayed on the TV screen are represented by a 2-dimensional array of pixels.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 5, the TV screen may be represented by a 720 * 480 array of pixels corresponding to a graphics plane stored in the graphics memory 334. 720 pixels may be arranged on the screen in the horizontal direction X, whereas 480 pixels may be arranged in the vertical direction Y. To perform graphics drawing operations, the CPU 318 may use an X, Y-coordinate system shown in FIG. 5, wherein coordinates X=0, Y=0 represent the top left hand corner of the TV screen, and coordinates X=720, Y=480 represent the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      It should be noted that due to "overscan" conditions, a television receiver may produce a raster on its screen so that pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions may not be entirely in the view of the user.
      <br/>
      Therefore, TV broadcast systems prevent images from being displayed outside of a "safe title" area located within approximately a 10% border all around the edge of the screen.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 5, the safe title area contains approximately 576 pixels in the horizontal direction, and 400 pixels in the vertical direction.
      <br/>
      With such a scheme, the top left hand corner of the safe title area is located at position X=72, Y=40.
      <br/>
      The bottom right hand corner of the safe title area has coordinates X=648, Y=440.
      <br/>
      On the discussed below diagrams that illustrate the functional modes of the GUI, an outer solid-lined box represents the edge of the TV screen, and a dash line shows the border of the safe title area.
      <br/>
      The graphical objects displayed in various GUI modes are drawn in accordance with the graphical object drawing procedure discussed above in connection with FIGS. 2-4.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Referring to FIG. 6, when the TV GUI of the present invention is placed in a channel changer mode that enables users to select TV channels, a TV set coupled to the satellite receiver 300 displays a graphical channel changer 800 having a vertical channel bar that includes graphical channel boxes 802 representing TV channels available in the satellite receiver 300.
      <br/>
      For example, each box 802 may contain the channel number and logo of a TV channel.
      <br/>
      In a digital satellite TV system, the channel bar may represent about 1,000 TV channels.
      <br/>
      A restricted number of the boxes 802 may be displayed on the TV screen at any given time.
      <br/>
      For example, FIG. 6 shows that six boxes 802 representing channels 287-292 are simultaneously displayed.
      <br/>
      The vertical channel bar may be represented by 120 * 300 pixels.
      <br/>
      For example, its top left corner may have coordinates X=122, Y=90, and its bottom right corner may be arranged at X=242, Y=390.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Up and down scroll bars 804 and 806 may be arranged near the channel bar to allow a user to move up and down through the entire list of TV channels.
      <br/>
      For example, the scroll bars 804 and 806 shown in FIG. 6 represent channels 100 through 999.
      <br/>
      A single click of the pointing device button causes the charnel changer 800 to move up or down by one channel with respect to the TV channels currently represented in the channel boxes 802.
      <br/>
      For example, when the user clicks the pointing device held in the direction of the up scroll bar 804, the boxes 802 will shift from channels 287-292 to channels 286-291.
      <br/>
      If the pointing device points at the down scroll bar 806, a single click will cause the boxes 802 to move from channels 287-292 to channels 288-293.
      <br/>
      Holding down the pointing device button may cause the list of TV channels to scroll continuously.
      <br/>
      A relative position indicator 808 shows the position of the TV channels currently displayed in the channel boxes with respect to other TV channels.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      It may be difficult to find a required channel among 1,000 channels provided by satellite TV, when the user does not know the number of the required channel.

      <br/>
      The numbers of the first and last channels are respectively placed on the top and bottom of the scale.

      For example, the channel bar 810 has numbers 100 and 999 on its top and bottom indicating that TV channels 100 through 999 are represented.
      <br/>
      When a user points the pointing device at a selected region of the channel bar 810, the channel boxes 802 display numbers and logos of TV channels represented by that selected region.

      In this mode, the TV GUI of the present invention displays an electronic program guide 900 based on the graphical channel changer 800.
      <br/>
      This arrangement allows users to review TV programming information, and then, to select a TV channel that carries a desired TV program by directing the remote pointing device at the channel box 802 for the selected TV channel.

      <br/>
      Each horizontal program bar 902 is aligned with the channel box 802 representing the TV channel that carries the TV programs indicated in that program bar 902.
      <br/>
      Below the horizontal bars 902 are time legends that indicate the time of the TV programs represented by the horizontal bars 902.
      <br/>
      For example, the electronic program guide 900 shown in FIG. 7 contains TV programming from 7 p.m. to 8.30 pm.

    <p num="78">
      To move from the channel changer mode to the program guide mode, the user may click the pointing device held in the direction of the GUIDE button 818 on the screen.
      <br/>
      Switching from one mode into another is disclosed in more detail in our copending application Ser.

      No. 08/720,500, entitled "TELEVISION GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE THAT COMBINES ELECTRONIC PROGRAM GUIDE WITH GRAPHICAL CHANNEL CHANGER," filed concurrently herewith and incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      In the program guide mode, the GUIDE button 818 is transformed into an ARRANGE GUIDE button 918.
      <br/>
      When the user clicks the pointing device directed at the ARRANGE GUIDE button 918, the TV GUI switches into an arrange guide mode.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      As shown in FIG. 8, the TV GUI set in the arrange guide mode displays an arrange guide menu 1000 that contains various options for arranging the program guide.
      <br/>
      For instance, the arrange guide menu 1000 may comprise a channel number option 1002, a channel name option 1004, and a program name option 1006.
      <br/>
      The channel number option 1002 enables a user to arrange TV channels in the program guide in order of their numbers, as shown, for example, in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      As discussed in more detail below, the channel name option 1004 allows TV channels in the program guide to be arranged according to their names, and the program name option 1006 allows TV programs in the program guide to be sorted in alphabetical order.
      <br/>
      The options may be selected by clicking the pointing device directed at option boxes on the screen that represent the sorting options 1002, 1004, and 1006.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      In the arrange guide mode, the program guide 900 is removed.
      <br/>
      However, the channel changer 800 displayed in the channel changer mode and in the program guide mode, remains unaltered.
      <br/>
      In addition to the channel boxes 802, the TV GUI maintains up and down scroll bars 804 and 806, and a direct access bar 810.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      By default, the TV GUI may start with the program guide having TV channels arranged in order of their numbers, as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      In the arrange guide mode, the user may click the pointing device directed at the channel name option box 1004 to rearrange the program guide according to channel names.
      <br/>
      In response, the CPU 318 performs a sorting procedure to alphabetically sort the available TV channels in order of their names.
      <br/>
      When the sorting procedure is completed, the TV GUI is moved into a mode of a program guide sorted in a alphabetical order by channel names.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      As shown in FIG. 9, in this mode, the program guide contains a channel changer 1100 having a graphical configuration identical to the configuration of the channel changer 800 displayed in the GUI modes shown in FIGS. 6-8. The channel changer 1100 is composed of channel boxes 1102 positioned on the TV screen at the same locations as the channel boxes 802 displayed in the channel changer and program guide modes.
      <br/>
      As a result, the program guide sorted by channel names has the same format as the program guide in FIG. 7 arranged in order of channel numbers.
      <br/>
      Thus, the user remains in a familiar environment and does not need to adapt to a new format on the screen.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      In the program guide sorted by channel names, the channel boxes 1102 are arranged so as to display channel logos in alphabetical order from the top to the bottom of the channel changer 1100.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 7, in the program guide arranged according to channel numbers, the FOX channel 291 follows the CBS channel 290 and precedes the Disney (DIS) channel 292.
      <br/>
      By contrast, in the program guide arranged in order of channel names, the FOX channel 291 follows the CBS channel 290 and the DIS channel 292.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The alphabetical order of channel names is reflected in the arrangement of a direct access bar 1110 having a graduated scale, in which letters A and Z on the top and bottom of the scale replace channel numbers 100 and 999 displayed in the direct access bar 810 (FIGS. 8 and 9).
      <br/>
      The letters A and Z imply that TV channels represented by the graduated scale of the direct access bar 1110 are arranged in alphabetical order from the top to the bottom of the bar scale.
      <br/>
      For example, if the user clicks the pointing device directed at the middle of the direct access bar 1100, TV channels with names beginning with letters in the middle of the alphabet (for instance, L, M and N) may be displayed in the channel boxes 1102.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      The program guide sorted by channel names further comprises horizontal program bars 902 similar to the horizontal program bars of the program guide arranged according to channel numbers.
      <br/>
      Each horizontal program bar 902 is aligned with the channel box 1102 representing the TV channel that carries the TV programs indicated in that program bar 902.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      To maintain a common program guide format, all other icons displayed in the program guide arranged in order of channel numbers remain unchanged in the program guide arranged according to channel names.
      <br/>
      For example, the arrange guide button 918 is displayed to enable the user to switch into the arrange guide mode shown in FIG. 8 to rearrange the program guide.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      In addition to sorting TV channels in order of their numbers or names, the user is able to rearrange the program guide according to program names.
      <br/>
      When the TV GUI is set in the arrange guide mode, the user may direct the pointing device at the program name option box 1006 to switch the TV GUI into a mode of a program guide sorted in alphabetical order by program names.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      In response to the user input, the CPU 318 carries out a program sorting procedure to sort TV programs to be broadcast over available TV channels during a predetermined time period.
      <br/>
      For example, the CPU 318 may sort TV programs available during the half-hour slot starting from the current time which may be rounded to the nearest half-hour.
      <br/>
      For example, if the current time is 7:12 p.m., the programs from 7.00 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. may be sorted.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      As shown in FIG. 10, in the GUI mode of a program guide sorted by program names, the program guide contains a channel changer 1200 having the graphical configuration identical to the configuration of the channel changers 800 and 1100 displayed in the GUI modes shown in FIGS. 6-9. The channel changer 1200 is composed of channel boxes 1202 positioned on the TV screen at the same locations as the channel boxes 802 and 1102 displayed in the above-discussed modes.
      <br/>
      Thus, the program guide sorted by program names has the same format as the program guides arranged in order of channel numbers, and names.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      The horizontal program bars 902 that contain information on TV programs are aligned with the channel boxes 1202 representing TV channels that carry the TV programs indicated in the program bars 902.
      <br/>
      As discussed above, the CPU 318 may sort TV programs for the current half-hour slot.
      <br/>
      In this case, the program bars 902 also contain only information on TV programs for the current half-hour slot.
      <br/>
      For example, FIG. 10 shows that the horizontal program bars 902 indicate TV programs from 7.00 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. As no information on TV programs for future time periods is available, the program guide sorted by program names does not have the time scroll bars and direct access time bar displayed in the GUI modes shown in FIGS. 7-9. The MORE button 906 may be provided to enable the user to utilize additional features of the TV GUI, for example, theme selection capability.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      TV channels displayed in the channel boxes 1202 are arranged according to names of TV programs to be carried by the TV channels.
      <br/>
      The TV programs are listed in program bars 902 in alphabetic order.
      <br/>
      The channel box 1202 indicating a TV channel that carries a TV program, the name of which begins with letter A, is arranged above the channel box 1202 for a TV channel carrying a TV program, the name of which begins with letter B. For example, as shown in FIG. 10, the Disney channel 292, that carries a TV program beginning with letter M, follows the ABC channel 287, that carries a TV program beginning with letter E, but proceeds the CBS channel 290, that carries a TV program beginning with letter W. TV channels that carry TV programs, names of which begin with digits, may be arranged before TV channels carrying programs that begin with letters.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      A direct access bar 1210 has a graduated scale from A to Z to represent TV channels arranged according to names of their programs.
      <br/>
      For example, if the user clicks the pointing device directed at the middle of the direct access bar 1200, TV channels that carry TV programs with names beginning with letters in the middle of the alphabet (for instance, L, M and N) may be displayed in the channel boxes 1202.
    </p>
    <p num="94">To keep a common format, the arrangements associated with the channel changer 1200, including channel scroll bars 804 and 806, and relative position indicator 808, are maintained unchanged compared to the channel changers 800 and 1100 arranged according to channel numbers and names (FIGS. 6-9).</p>
    <p num="95">
      When the user makes any selection using the program guides sorted by channel names or program names, the TV GUI automatically returns to the channel changer arranged in order of channel numbers.
      <br/>
      Thus, no manual switch into the initial state is needed.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      There accordingly has been described a TV graphical user interface that includes a graphical channel changer for enabling a user to select a required TV channel among about 1000 channels provided by a satellite TV system.
      <br/>
      The graphical channel changer contains a vertical channel bar composed of channel boxes that display numbers and logos of selected TV channels.
      <br/>
      To switch the TV set to a required TV channel, the user directs the pointing device at the graphical channel box that indicates the required channel.
      <br/>
      A program guide that contains a list of TV programs may be provided based on the channel changer.
      <br/>
      Vertical program bars that display TV programs are aligned with the channel boxes indicating TV channels that carry the corresponding TV programs.
      <br/>
      An arrange guide mode is provided to enable the user to arrange the program guide in order of TV channel numbers, or in alphabetical order according to names of TV channels or TV programs.
      <br/>
      The graphical configuration of the channel changer and icons associated with the channel changer remains unchanged in any arrangement of the program guide to present TV channels and programs in a common format.
