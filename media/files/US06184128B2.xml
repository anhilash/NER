    <p num="1">
      The present invention generally relates to processing a semiconductor substrate.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention relates to methods of forming trenches, holes and interconnects using a dual damascene process.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Conventional semiconductor devices typically comprise a semiconductor substrate, normally made of monocrystalline silicon, and a plurality of dielectric and conductive layers formed thereon.
      <br/>
      An integrated circuit is formed containing a plurality of conductive patterns comprising conductive lines separated by interwiring spacings, and a plurality of interconnect lines, such as bus lines, bit lines, word lines and logic interconnect lines.
      <br/>
      Such interconnection lines, made of metal interconnect materials, generally constitute a limiting factor in terms of size (width) and various functional characteristics of the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      As such, there exists a need to provide a reliable interconnection structure having a small size yet capable of achieving higher operating speeds, improved signal-to-noise ratio and improved reliability.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Using a dual damascene process, semiconductor devices are patterned with several thousand openings for conductive lines and vias which are filled with a conductive metal, such as aluminum or copper, and serve to interconnect the active and/or passive elements of the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      The dual damascene process also is used for forming the multilevel signal lines of conductive metal in the insulating layers of multilayer substrate on which semiconductor devices are mounted.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Damascene (single damascene) is an interconnection fabrication process in which grooves are formed in an insulating layer and filled with metal to form the conductive lines.
      <br/>
      Dual damascene is a multi-level interconnection process in which, in addition to forming the grooves of single damascene, the conductive via openings also are formed.
      <br/>
      In the standard dual damascene process, the insulating layer is coated with a resist material which is exposed to a first mask with the image pattern of the via openings and the pattern is anisotropically etched in the upper half of the insulating layer.
      <br/>
      After removal of the patterned resist material, the insulating layer is coated with a resist material which is exposed to a second mask with the image pattern of the conductive lines in alignment with the via openings.
      <br/>
      In anisotropically etching the openings for the conductive lines in the upper half of the insulating material, the via openings already present in the upper half are simultaneously etched in the lower half of the insulating material.
      <br/>
      After the etching is complete, both the vias and grooves are filled metal.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Dual damascene is an improvement over single damascene because it permits the filling of both the conductive grooves and vias with metal at the same time, thereby eliminating process steps.
      <br/>
      Although standard dual damascene offers advantages over other processes for forming interconnections, it has a number of disadvantages and problems.
      <br/>
      For example, the edges of the via openings in the lower half of the insulating layer are not only poorly defined because there are two etching steps; but also because the via edges are unprotected during the second etching.
      <br/>
      Thus, improvements are needed in the standard dual damascene process to eliminate the poor edge definition of the via openings.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another problem associated with edge definition of the via openings is illustrated in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      This problem is frequently encountered when an low k materials are employed in the semiconductor device.
      <br/>
      In particular, FIG. 8 shows the poor sidewall profile due to undesirable over-etching of the insulating material when the photoresist is removed or stripped.
      <br/>
      This is commonly referred to as undercutting.
      <br/>
      Undercutting is often caused when removing or stripping conventional photoresists from substrates during dual damascene processing.
      <br/>
      While the undesirable over-etching is shown in connection with the via, the same problem may occur with the trench.
      <br/>
      The over-etching leads to malformed metal vias and/or trenches as well as the trapping of air between the metal via (and/or trench) and the insulating material.
      <br/>
      This consequently degrades the electrical properties of the resultant electronic devices.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In processes where transparent layers are employed, especially in instances where transparent layers are employed over reflective layers, it is difficult to adequately pattern (for example, due to poor critical dimension control and/or undercutting).
      <br/>
      As a result, antireflection (ARC) layers may be employed.
      <br/>
      But ARCs tend to unnecessarily complicate the processing.
      <br/>
      T is therefore desirable to improve printability of photoresists while eliminating the use of ARCs.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention provides dual damascene methods useful with low k insulation materials.
      <br/>
      The present invention also provides methods of processing semiconductors having low k insulation materials while not deleteriously effecting the low k insulation materials (that is, by not causing undercutting of the low k insulation layers).
      <br/>
      The present invention provides methods of adequately forming interconnects and using short wavelength light and/or ultra-thin photoresists.
      <br/>
      The present invention involves forming high quality interconnects and thus provides methods of forming electronic devices having desirable electrical properties.
      <br/>
      In particular, the sidewalls of trenches and vias formed during a dual damascene process according to the present invention are of high quality in that they do not exhibit undesirable bowing, air trapping or other deformities.
      <br/>
      The trenches and vias formed during a dual damascene process according to the present invention are of high quality because of the improved printability when using short wavelength light and/or ultra-thin photoresists.
      <br/>
      Another advantage obtainable with the present invention is that it is not necessary to use ARCs, especially where insulation layers containing silicon nitride are employed.

    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      The present invention involves forming high quality, well defined vias, trenches, and other types of interconnect recesses in semiconductor devices containing low k polymer materials using short wavelength light and/or ultra-thin photoresists.
      <br/>
      The vias and trenches are well defined in that the sidewalls are perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the substrate.
      <br/>
      In other words, poor sidewall definition is eliminated or minimized by the present invention.
      <br/>
      The present invention thus provides improved dual damascene methods for substrates containing at least one low k polymer material layer by using ultra-thin photoresists.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Low k polymer materials are insulation materials and include polyimides, fluorinated polyimides, polysilsequioxane, benzocyclobutene (BCB), parlene F, parlene N and amorphous polytetrafluoroethylene.
      <br/>
      A specific example of a commercially available low k polymer material is Flare (tm)  from AlliedSignal believed to be derived from perfluorobiphenyl and aromatic bisphenols.
      <br/>
      Low k polymer materials provide electrical insulation between various layers, devices and regions within semiconductor substrates.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Ultra-thin photoresists are employed as masks for protecting selected regions of the semiconductor device during the etching steps.
      <br/>
      Ultra-thin photoresists in accordance with the present invention have a thickness of about 1,500  Angstrom  or less during certain processing steps.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the ultra-thin photoresist layer has a thickness from about 500  Angstrom  to about 1,500  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the ultra-thin photoresist layer has a thickness from about 600  Angstrom  to about 1,250  Angstrom  (about 1,250  Angstrom  or less).
      <br/>
      In yet another embodiment, the ultra-thin photoresist layer has a thickness from about 700  Angstrom  to about 1,100  Angstrom  (about 1,100  Angstrom  or less).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The ultra-thin photoresist layer has a thickness suitable for functioning as a mask for etching the underlying layer including underlying low k material layers and for forming patterns or openings in the developed ultra-thin photoresist layer that are about 0.1  MU m or less and even about 0.05  MU m or less.
      <br/>
      Since the ultra-thin photoresist layer is relatively thin compared with conventionally used I-line and other photoresists, improved critical dimension control is realized.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the ultra-thin photoresist layer has a thickness such that removal or stripping of the photoresist does not adversely effect the etched and exposed low k material layer.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Ultra-thin resists are processed using small wavelength radiation.
      <br/>
      As used herein, small wavelength radiation means electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength of about 365 nm or less.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, small wavelength radiation includes electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength of about 250 nm or less.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, small wavelength radiation includes extreme UV electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength of about 160 nm or less.
      <br/>
      In yet another embodiment, small wavelength radiation includes extreme UV electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength of about 15 nm or less.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Small wavelength radiation increases precision and thus the ability to improve critical dimension control.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of wavelengths to which the ultra-thin photoresists are sensitive (undergo chemical transformation enabling subsequent development) include about 365 nm, about 248 nm, about 193 nm, about 157 nm, about 13 nm, about 11 nm, and about 1 nm.
      <br/>
      Specific sources of radiation include KrF excimer lasers having a wavelength of about 248 nm, a XeHg vapor lamp having a wavelength from about 200 mn to about 250 nm, mercury-xenon arc lamps having a wavelength of about 248 nm, an ArF excimer laser having a wavelength of about 193 nm, an F2 excimer laser having a wavelength of about 157 nm, extreme UV light having wavelengths of about 13.5 nm and/or about 11.4 nm, and X-rays having a wavelength of about 1 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In embodiments where the patterns or openings (vias and/or trenches) formed in the developed ultra-thin photoresist layer are from about 0.1  MU m to about 0.15  MU m, a 157 nm sensitive photoresist or a 193 nm sensitive photoresist is preferably employed.
      <br/>
      In embodiments where the patterns or openings formed in the developed ultra-thin photoresist layer are about 0.1  MU m or less, a 13 nm sensitive photoresist or an 11 nm sensitive photoresist (extreme UV photoresist) is preferably employed.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Positive or negative ultra-thin photoresists may be employed in the methods of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Examples of ultra-thin photoresists include those containing a partially t-butoxycarbonyloxy substituted poly-p-hydroxystyrene, a novolak, or a polyvinylphenol.
      <br/>
      Photoresists are commercially available from a number of sources, including Shipley Company, JSR Microelectronics, Kodak, Hoechst Celanese Corporation, and Brewer.

      An insulation material layer 13, such as silicon nitride, is formed over the substrate 10.
      <br/>
      The insulation material layer 13 may alternatively include one or more of silicon dioxide, silicon oxynitride, boronitride, silicon boronitride and silicon carbide.
      <br/>
      The insulation material layer 13 may be formed to any suitable thickness using any suitable technique, for instance, using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques.
      <br/>
      CVD techniques include low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) or plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the thickness of the insulation material layer 13 may range, for example, from about 500  Angstrom  to about 2,500  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The insulation material layer 13 subsequently serves as an etch stop layer for the later described low K material layers, as well as a barrier layer for the metal structure 12.

      A low k material layer 14, such as BCB, is formed over the insulation material 13.

      Low k material layer 14 may be formed to any suitable thickness using any suitable technique that may depend, for instance, on the material or materials used.
      <br/>
      In the case of BCB, a spin on technique is useful.
      <br/>
      Also in the case of BCB, the thickness of the low k material layer 14 may range, for example, from about 5,000  Angstrom  to about 10,000  Angstrom .

      <br/>
      Any suitable patterning technique may be used to define the preliminary contact opening 19 in the ultra-thin photoresist layer 18 and hard mask layer 16.
      <br/>
      For example, standard photolithographic techniques may be used.
      <br/>
      In particular, the ultra-thin photoresist layer 18 is exposed to radiation and developed to provide a patterned photoresist.
      <br/>
      The patterned photoresist is formed using electromagnetic radiation having a relatively small wavelength (for example, less than 365 nm).
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength of about 11 nm is employed.
      <br/>
      Either the exposed or unexposed portions of the ultra-thin photoresist layer 18 are removed or developed to provide the patterned photoresist exposing a corresponding portion of the hard mask layer 16 in preliminary contact opening 19.

      <br/>
      Since the ultra-thin photoresist layer 18 has a thickness about 2,000  Angstrom  or less, the stripping process does not materially effect the conformation of the low k material layer 14 or the preliminary contact opening 19.

      The second ultra-thin photoresist layer 24 and the second hard mask layer 22 subsequently serve as a trench mask for forming a trench over a plurality of contact holes.

      Any suitable patterning technique may be used to define the trench mask in the second ultra-thin photoresist layer 24 and second hard mask layer 22.

      In this embodiment, electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength of about 11 nm is employed.

      The exposed portions of the second hard mask layer 22 are etched anisotropically to further form the trench exposing at least a portion of the second low k material layer 20.

The width of the trench may depend on the resistivity of the conductive material used for creating an interconnect within the trench.

      The width of the trench is typically larger than the width of previously described preliminary contact opening 19.

    <p num="35">
      Referring to FIG. 5, exposed portions of the second low k material layer 20, low k material layer 14 and insulation material layer 13 are removed in any suitable manner to define an opening 26 comprised of a trench or interconnect channel over at least one contact hole formed over metal structure 12.
      <br/>
      Any suitable etch technique may be used to etch second low k material layer 20, low k material layer 14 and insulation material layer 13.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a selective etch technique may be used to etch the material of low k material layers 20 and 14 and at a relatively greater rate as compared to the rate that the material of the insulation material layer 13, second ultra-thin photoresist layer 24, and/or second hard mask layer 22 are etched.
      <br/>
      In other words, the insulation material layer 13 serves as an etch-stop layer when etching low k material layers 20 and 14.
      <br/>
      Portions of the low k material layer 14 and second low k material layer 20 are typically etched in an anisotropic manner using an oxygen containing gas exposing a portion of the insulation material layer 13.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The exposed portion of the insulation material layer 13 is etched in an anisotropic manner using a suitable gas mixture, primarily depending upon the composition of the insulation material layer 13 exposing at least a portion of the metal structure 12.
      <br/>
      The second ultra-thin photoresist layer 24 may then be stripped from the substrate, and the substrate may be optionally cleaned to remove residue from the opening 26.
      <br/>
      However, since the second ultra-thin photoresist layer 24 has a thickness about 2,000  Angstrom  or less, the second ultra-thin photoresist layer 24 is typically removed during removal of portions of the low k material layers 14 and 20 where an oxygen containing gas is used as an etchant.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, therefore, the insulation material layer 13 and the second hard mask layer 22 contain different materials to afford etch selectivity.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Referring to FIG. 6, a suitable conductive material or materials is formed or deposited over the substrate, including filling the opening 26 and over the second hard mask layer 22.
      <br/>
      For example, an optional barrier layer 28 and a conductive layer 30 are deposited over the substrate.
      <br/>
      The optional barrier layer 28 may serve as a diffusion barrier preventing materials from the conductive layer 30 from diffusing into the low k material layer 14 and/or second low k material layer 20.
      <br/>
      The optional barrier layer 28 is formed over the substrate so that it covers the side walls and bottom in the opening 26.
      <br/>
      The barrier layer 28 may be formed using any suitable technique to a thickness sufficient to serve as a diffusion barrier for conductive layer 30.
      <br/>
      For example, the thickness of the barrier layer 28 may be in the range from about 300  Angstrom  to about 500  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The barrier layer 28 is a conductive layer containing, for example, tantalum, tungsten, titanium, alloys, silicides, and/or nitrides thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Conductive layer 30 is then formed over the substrate, substantially filling opening 26.
      <br/>
      The conductive layer may be made of any suitable conductive material or materials.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable conductive materials include copper, tungsten, gold, silver, aluminum, any alloys and/or combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the conductive material is copper or a copper alloy.
      <br/>
      The conductive layer 30 may be formed to any suitable thickness using any suitable technique.
      <br/>
      For example, the thickness of the conductive layer 30 may range from about 0.1  MU m to about 2  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The optional barrier layer 28 and the conductive layer 30 may be deposited using CVD techniques or physical vapor deposition techniques.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, when copper is used as the conductive layer, the surface of the barrier layer may be activated using copper atoms (copper seeds) by contact displacement followed by the autocatalytic deposition of electrolessly deposited copper.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Referring to FIG. 7, conductive layer 30 is planarized to the surface of the barrier layer 28; that is, portions of the conductive layer 30 are removed from the top surface of barrier layer 28 above the second hard mask layer 22.
      <br/>
      Opening 26 remains substantially filled with the barrier layer 28 and conductive layer 30.
      <br/>
      Any suitable technique may be used to planarize the substrate and may depend, for instance, on the specific identity of the material used to make the conductive layer 30.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the substrate is planarized (a portion of the conductive layer is removed) using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) techniques using a polishing solution or slurry depending upon the specific identity of the materials used for the conductive layer 30.
      <br/>
      As a result of CMP techniques, dishing may occur wherein the conductive layer 30 is removed to a level below the top surface of the barrier layer 28, and in some instances, to a level just below the top surface of the second hard mask layer 22.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The portion of the optional barrier layer 28, if employed, exposed over the second hard mask layer 22 is removed using CMP techniques or an etch gas mixture.
      <br/>
      After the portion of the barrier layer exposed over the second hard mask layer 22 is removed, the substrate may be cleaned using conventional techniques such as wet cleaning techniques.
      <br/>
      Removal of the exposed portion of the barrier layer serves to planarize the substrate while leaving undisturbed the portion of the barrier layer 28 surrounding conductive layer 30.
      <br/>
      If employed, the etch gas mixture has high etch selectivity for the barrier metal as compared to a hard mask material, such as silicon oxide, which may constitute the second hard mask layer 22 as well as other conductive metals such as copper or copper alloys, which may constitute the conductive layer 30.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the etch gas mixture provides a selective etch such that the conductive layer 30 serves as a mask in etching the barrier layer 28.
      <br/>
      The etch gas mixture etches in an isotropic manner whereby there is no or very little change in side wall profile of the conductive layer 30.

      Generally referring to FIGS. 1-7, the methods disclosed herein may be used to create another via layer and another interconnect layer.
