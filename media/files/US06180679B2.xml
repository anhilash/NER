    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to the fields of pharmaceutical and organic chemistry and provides cryptophycin compounds useful for treating fungal infections.</p>
    <p num="3">
      The incidence of serious, life-threatening, fungal infections is increasing at an alarming rate.
      <br/>
      The number of Candida albicans bloodstream infections in non-teaching hospitals increased by 370% between 1980 and 1990.
      <br/>
      At the same time the incidence of bloodstream infections by C. albicans in teaching hospitals increased by 487% in the same time period.
      <br/>
      With the exception of coagulase negative staphylococci, statistically, C. albicans represents the fastest growing area of concern in hospital acquired bloodstream infections (Banerjee et al., 1991, American Journal of Medicine 91 (3B): 86S-89S).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The rising incidence of nosocomial fungal infections is being fueled by changing medical practices, including invasive surgical procedures addressing such problems as joint replacement and open heart surgery, increased use of cancer chemotherapy, and the AIDS epidemic.
      <br/>
      All of these processes compromise the immune system and provide an environment in which fungal infections can be established.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Unfortunately, the diagnosis of fungal infections is difficult and time consuming.
      <br/>
      Rather than waiting for the results of diagnostic tests, empirical antifungal therapy must frequently be initiated with a compound such as amphotericin B (which may have safety/toxicity issues) or one of the azoles to which fungal species are developing resistance.
      <br/>
      Thus, having an antifungal with a broad spectrum of activity coupled with a low toxicity profile would be very desirable.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Further, the existence of multiple drug resistance (mdr)-related genes in a non-pathological as well as in key opportunistic pathological fungi has been discovered.
      <br/>
      These genes have been termed "mdr-like" because of the homology that exists between the proteins encoded by these genes and the human mdr-1 gene product.

    <p num="7">With the discovery of mdr-like genes in a variety of fungi, including key pathogenic fungi, such as Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans the prospect of discovering an antifungal agent that can have fungal mdr inhibitor activity becomes extraordinarily desirable.</p>

      A therapeutically effective amount can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by the use of known techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances.
      <br/>
      In determining the therapeutically effective amount or dose, a number of factors are considered by the attending diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the species of mammal; its size, age, and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree of or involvement or the severity of the disease; the response of the individual mammal; the particular compound administered; the bioavailability characteristics of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of concomitant medication; and other relevant circumstances.

      <br/>
      For example, a compound of Compounds I-V or a compound of formula IA can be administered orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously, transdermally, intranasally, rectally, and the like.
      <br/>
      Oral, intravenous or intramuscular administration is generally preferred.
      <br/>
      One skilled in the art of preparing formulations can readily select the proper form and mode of administration depending upon the particular characteristics of the compound selected, the disease state to be treated, the stage of the disease, and other relevant cicumstances.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The compounds can be administered alone or in the form of a pharmaceutical composition in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients, the proportion and nature of which are determined by the solubility and chemical properties of the compound selected, the chosen route of administration, and standard pharmaceutical practice.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the invention, while effective themselves, may be formulated and administered, where appropriate, in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts for purposes of stability, convenience of crystallization, increased solubility and the like Compounds of this invention have been found to be useful against pathogenic fungi.
      <br/>
      Example of pathogenic fungi include, but are not limited to, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Coccidiodes immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Asperfillus fumigatus, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Rhizopus arrhizus.
      <br/>
      For example, the usefulness for treating Cryptococcus neoformans can be illustrated with test results against Cryptococcus neoformans employing yeast nitrogen base detrose agar medium.
      <br/>
      In carrying out the assay, a compound of this invention is solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide supplemented with Tween 20.
      <br/>
      Twofold dilutions are made with sterile distilled water/10 percent DMSO to obtain final drug concentrations in the agar dilution assay plates ranging from 0.008  MU g/ml to 16.0  MU g/ml against an expanded panel of 84 Cryptococcus neoformans strains.
      <br/>
      The minimum inhibitory concentration against the panel of 84 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates is determined to illustrate the desired antifungal activity.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      These compounds and compositions can be administered to mammals for veterinary use.
      <br/>
      For example, domestic animals can be treated in much the same way as a human clinical patient.
      <br/>
      In general, the dosage required for therapeutic effect will vary according to the type of use, mode of administration, as well as the particularized requirements of the individual hosts.
      <br/>
      Typically, dosages will range from about 0.001 to 1000 mg/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 10 mg/kg of the host body weight.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, dosages within these ranges can be administered by constant infusion over an extended period of time, usually exceeding 24 hours, until the desired therapeutic benefits are obtained.
      <br/>
      Indeed, drug dosage, as well as route of administration, must be selected on the basis of relative effectiveness, relative toxicity, growth characteristics of tumor and effect of Formula I compound on cell cycle, drug pharmacokinetics, age, sex, physical condition of the patient and prior treatment.
