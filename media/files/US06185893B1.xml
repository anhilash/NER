      <br/>
      A paving block system and corresponding components and methods are disclosed.
      <br/>
      The system finds particularly efficacious application in forming patios, walkways and driveways, and may comprise interconnecting or adjoining bottom barriers and side barriers.
      <br/>
      Each bottom barrier receives one or more paving blocks thereon, and may optionally have formed in the bottom surface thereof a recess for receiving a top rail formed into bottom barrier.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments of the present invention, adjoining blocks interconnect to form a relatively continuous paving block top surface.
      <br/>
      The present invention permits the effects of undesired displacement forces acting on the blocks, such as frost heave, to be reduced or minimized, and further permits a user to install a driveway, walkway or patio relatively rapidly

      This application claims priority and other benefits from the filing date of U.S. Provisional patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 60/030,027 entitled "Lawn Edging System, Components and Method" to Gaston filed Nov. 2, 1996.
    </p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to landscape edging systems, methods and components, and to paving block edging systems, methods and components for forming borders or walkways between adjoining garden, landscape, driveway, walkway, patio or sidewalk areas.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Gardeners, landscapers and homeowners frequently use border or edging material such as fences, logs, railroad ties, bricks, concrete blocks and the like to provide a decorative edge for a landscape or garden.
      <br/>
      Such border or edging material is also frequently employed to physically separate landscape, garden and other areas from one another.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Plastic landscape edging is now commonly used to divide and separate different landscape areas to preclude material in one area from spilling over into an adjacent area, and to prevent grass, flowers or the like contained in one area from growing in an adjoining area.
      <br/>
      For example, plastic edging is typically used to divide grass landscape areas from adjoining garden areas, and helps prevent grass from taking root in adjoining garden areas.
      <br/>
      Plastic edging also helps prevent garden bedding material from spilling onto the adjoining landscape area.
      <br/>
      The most prevalent materials used to fabricate landscape edging today are inert, synthetic flexible plastics such as polyethylene and ethylene vinyl acetate.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the past, landscape edging has been formed from lengths of wood, corrugated metal strips, plastic, cement blocks and poured concrete.
      <br/>
      Wood is subject to rot and insect attack and decays over time.
      <br/>
      Wood landscape timbers must therefore be replaced rather frequently.
      <br/>
      Ungalvanized metal bands oxidize and rust, and tend to become bent and misshapen over time.
      <br/>
      Even galvanized metal bands eventually corrode once the protective zinc coating has been oxidized.
      <br/>
      Concrete blocks are inflexible, difficult to install and generally heavy.
      <br/>
      Poured concrete is expensive, difficult or impossible to modify once poured and set, and difficult and time-consuming to install.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Plastic landscape edging, on the other hand, is inexpensive, readily manufactured, flexible and has a long service life.
      <br/>
      As a result of the disadvantages inhering in wood, metal and concrete landscaping materials and the unique advantages of plastic, plastic landscape edging has become the landscape edging material of choice of many consumers.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      While landscape edging formed from inert synthetic plastic has many advantages such as being flexible and resisting deterioration well, problems nevertheless occur in their use.
      <br/>
      Conventional landscape edging usually consists of a longitudinally extending strip of material having a lower edge that is inserted into the ground to a predetermined depth and an upper edge or rail that generally projects above the ground.
      <br/>
      The edging is typically installed by digging a narrow trench, inserting the lower edge to a predetermined depth, refilling the trench and compacting the earth around the edging.
      <br/>
      Such installation normally maintains the edging in its intended position for a period of time.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      As time progresses, however, the environment and other factors actively work against the edging remaining in its original position.
      <br/>
      The edging may be walked on, bumped, kicked, shoved aside or otherwise engaged in such a manner that it is displaced in respect of its original position.
      <br/>
      Landscape mowers or tractors may repeatedly drive over the edging and displace or damage the edging.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The winter effects of frost heave, or the freezing and thawing action of the earth surrounding the edging, are often more severe than the foregoing effects in respect of edging displacement or damage.
      <br/>
      The ground retains moisture in the fall that freezes with dropping temperatures.
      <br/>
      Water is one of the few materials having a coefficient of volume expansion that increases as temperature decreases, and the ground accordingly expands with frozen moisture in the winter.
      <br/>
      This has the effect of compressing and heaving the landscape edging, and as a result the edging breaks or is laterally or vertically displaced.
      <br/>
      When spring arrives in colder climates, plastic landscape edging is often found to have buckled upwards and protruded from the ground during the winter in response to frost heave, especially where adjacent strips of edging are connected to one another.
      <br/>
      As temperatures rise in spring, the moisture beneath the ground surface melts, again changing the volume of the subsurface ground adjoining the edging.
      <br/>
      As the seasons alternate, the landscape edging is repeatedly exposed to a variety of forces arising from changing soil volumes that, over the long term, cause the edging to become dislodged or damaged.

    <p num="22">The terms "lawn edging member," "landscape edging barrier," "landscape edging member," "strip barrier" and "edging barrier" are substantially synonymous, and mean an edging member formed of metal, plastic or other suitable material that is configured for use in at least one of landscape, walkway or driveway applications.</p>
    <p num="23">
      FIGS. 1(a) through 1(c) show one embodiment of landscape edging system 5 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Landscape edging member 10 is preferably elongated, and has top rail 14 for separating adjacent lawn, garden, walkway or patio areas.
      <br/>
      Top rail 14 has edging barrier 20 extending downwardly therefrom for placement in ground 400.
      <br/>
      At least a portion of top rail 14 is affixed to or forms part of upper portion 24 of edging barrier 20 such that top rail 14 protrudes or extends above ground surface 404 when at least lower portion 28 of edging barrier 20 is positioned beneath ground surface 404 in ground 400.
      <br/>
      The ends of landscape edging member 10 are preferably configured for connection to adjoining similar members 10 by any of several well known means, such as by connecting member 16 shown in FIG. 2(b), to thereby form a substantially continuous downwardly extending barrier 20 and top rail 14.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Any of a variety of known landscape edging members find application in certain embodiments of the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, landscape or lawn edging members of the types disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,378,949 to Dorris; U.S. Pat. No. 3,387,786 to Rynberk; U.S. Pat. No. 3,484,989 to Lazinsky; U.S. Pat. No. 3,485,449 to Wilson; U.S. Pat. No. 3,788,001 to Balfanz, Jr.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,281,473 to Emalfarb et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,644,685 to Tisbo et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,761, 923 to Reum et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,761,923 to Reum et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,809,459 to Brylla et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,858,379 to West; U.S. Pat. No. 4,969,289 to Trifiletti; U.S. Pat. No. 5,067, 273 to Richwine; U.S. Pat. No. 5,121,569 to Thomas; U.S. Pat. No. 5,201,154 to Thomas; U.S. Pat. No. 5,438,804 to Reum et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,036 to Torp, Jr. et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,519,970 to Reum et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,535,545 to Matz find particular efficacious and advantageous application in certain preferred embodiments of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Landscape edging member 10 is most preferably formed of a plastic such as polyethylene or ethylene vinyl acetate.
      <br/>
      Other elastomeric, polymeric or synthetic materials are also suitable for forming landscape edging member 10.
      <br/>
      Landscape edging member 10 is most preferably formed by extruding and molding a synthetic material that is resilient, flexible, inert, UV resistant and further capable of withstanding wide variations in ambient temperature and humidity.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      One significant drawback to most plastics finding application in landscape edging member 10 of the present invention is the relatively rapid breakdown of such plastics, and resulting deleterious effects, caused by exposure to ultra-violet (or UV) radiation.
      <br/>
      It is an advantage of the present invention that landscape edging member 10 is protected or shielded by block 60 from UV radiation by block 60.
      <br/>
      As a result, landscape edging member 10 of the present invention, when formed of plastic, does not break down or degrade as quickly in use in comparison to landscape edging members of the prior art that relatively continuously exposed to harmful UV radiation.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      FIGS. 1(a) through 1(c) further show landscape edging block 60 having bottom surface 64, opposing ends 68 and 72, and imaginary longitudinal axis 76 extending between the opposing ends 68 and 72.
      <br/>
      Bottom surface 64 has substantially longitudinally disposed recess 80 formed therein.
      <br/>
      Recess 80 is configured to receive at least a portion of top rail 14 therein, and extends over at least a portion of bottom surface 64.
      <br/>
      Two opposing ends 68 and 72 of block 60 are configured to engage, abut, or interconnect with the corresponding opposing ends of other adjoining landscape edging blocks 60 attached to the top rail by their respective recesses.
      <br/>
      Recess 80 is configured to receive at least a portion of top edge 14 therein, and extends over at least a portion of bottom surface 64.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, top rail 14 and recess 80 form complementary shapes, and are configured to prevent or impede block 60 from being removed from top rail 14 when an upward or lateral force is exerted upon block 60 and top rail 14 is disposed in recess 80.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As shown in FIG. 1(c), at least a portion of edging barrier 20 extends downwardly from the bottom surface of each block 60 into ground 400 when recesses 80 corresponding to each block 60 receive their corresponding at least portions of top rail 14 therein.
      <br/>
      Bottom surfaces 64 of the plurality of engaging, abutting or interconnected landscape blocks 60 may be disposed along or beneath ground surface 404.
      <br/>
      The embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 1(c), and other embodiments similar to it, lend themselves particularly well to installation applications where blocks 60 are retrofitted on existing, installed landscape edging barriers having conventional circular cross-section top rails 14.
      <br/>
      Such retrofitting avoids the requirement for removal of existing landscape edging members 10 and re-installation of new, differently configured landscape edging members 10.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIGS. 2(a) through 2(u) show perspective views of selected lawn edging members 10 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Top rails 14 of the present invention having various structural configurations are also illustrated in FIGS. 2(a) through 2(u).
      <br/>
      FIGS. 3(a) through 3(t) show cross-sectional views of selected lawn edging members 10 and blocks 60 of the present invention; top rails 14 of the present invention having various cross-sectional configurations are illustrated therein, along with corresponding blocks 60 having recesses 80 formed to receive top rails 14 therein.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      It will now become apparent to those skilled in the art that a virtually unlimited range of suitable cross-sectional shapes exists for top rail 14 and corresponding recess 80 of block 60 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, top rail 14 may be T-shaped, round, elliptical, triangular, square, rectangular or nearly any other suitable shape in cross-section.
      <br/>
      Recess 80 is most preferably formed to receive top rail 14 engagingly, snugly or tightly therein, and thus preferably assumes a shape complementary to that of top rail 14.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Lower portion 28 and central portion 30 of landscape edging member are most preferably shaped or configured to include means for anchoring landscape edging member 10 in ground 400.
      <br/>
      For example, lower portion 28 may include an anchor member having a triangular cross-section, wherein the apex of the triangle points downwardly as in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,438,804 and 5,519,970 to Reum et al.
      <br/>
      See also, for example, FIGS. 2(a), 2(b), 2(e), 2(f), 2(h), 3(d) and 3(g) herein.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments of the present invention, however, and as shown in FIGS. 3(u) through 3(oo), recess 80 need not conform to the shape of at least the bottom portion of top rail 14.
      <br/>
      Instead, recess 80 may be configured to receive top rail loosely therein.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Central portion 30 and lower portion 28 may also have a plurality of hollow, molded projections extending from one or both faces, where the interior of each projection is open on the opposite face corresponding to the portion, and the portion forms a concave soil socket or nesting region that becomes filled with soil when landscape edging member 10 is installed in ground 400.
      <br/>
      See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,201,154 to Thomas and U.S. Pat. No. 4,761,923 to Reum et al and FIGS. 2(c), 2(d), 2(f), 2(k), 2(l), 3(m), 3(c), 3(e), 3(f), 3(h), 3(l), 3(j), 3(k), 3(l), 3(p), 3(q), and 3(r) hereof.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Alternatively, central portion 30 or lower portion 28 may include a medial or longitudinal downwardly or upwardly pointing rib or end hook as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,410,458 to Bell.
      <br/>
      Blades, flanges, ears or securing lips of the types disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,036 to Torp, Jr. et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,788,001 to Balfanz, Jr., U.S. Pat. No. 4,644,685 to Tisbo and 4,281 to Emalfarb et al. may extend outwardly and upwardly or outwardly and downwardly from central portion 30 or lower portion 28 to form a means for anchoring landscape edging member 10 in ground 400.
      <br/>
      See, for example, FIGS. 2(e), 2(g), 2(j), 2(n), 2(o), 2(p), 2(t), 2(u), 3(a), 3(b), 3(o), 3(s) and 3(t) hereof.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Metal or plastic stakes may be driven at an oblique angle through barrier 20 after landscape edging member 10 has been installed in ground 400 to better secure landscape edging member 10 in the ground.
      <br/>
      See, for example, FIG. 2(s) herein.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Landscape edging member 10 is most preferably sufficiently flexible and structurally configured to permit ready packaging in coiled fashion.
      <br/>
      See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,519,970 to Reum et al., where lawn or landscape edging members are disclosed that lend themselves particularly well to being packaged in coiled fashion.
      <br/>
      See also FIG. 2(l) herein.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Landscape edging member 10 may also form a strip of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,456,045 to Bradley et al., where top edge or rail 14 is configured for withstanding hammering, the bottom edge of lower portion 28 is configured for penetration in ground 400, and edging member 10 has ends constructed for interlocking with adjacent strips or members.</p>
    <p num="37">
      FIGS. 4(a) through 4(b) show a variant of landscape edging system 5 of the present invention, where adapter clip 32 is disposed between inner sidewalls 82 of recess 80 and the outer surface of top rail 14.
      <br/>
      Adapter clip 32 has arms 35 and 37 that expand apart to accept top rail 14 therebetween when adapter 32 is pushed downwardly onto top rail 14.
      <br/>
      Arms 35 and 37 also preferably engage inner sidewalls 82 of recess 80 when block 60 is disposed atop clip 32 and top rail 14.
      <br/>
      Adapter clip 32 is preferably configured to permit block 60 having recess 80 of width 84 to suitably interconnect with and engage top rail 14, regardless (within reasonable bounds) of width 36 of top rail 14.
      <br/>
      Thus, adapter clip 32 permits block 60 to be fitted onto the top rail of any of a number of various different commercially available brands of lawn edging, many of which share no common top rail width 36.
      <br/>
      It will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that adapter clip 32 may be formed in many configurations other than C-shapes.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      FIGS. 4(c) through 4(f) show steps for installing system 5 of FIGS. 4(a) and 4(b) in ground 400, where block 60 and adapter clip 32 are installed on existing landscape edging member 10.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 4(g) through 4(l) show a variant of the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIGS. 4(a) through 4(f) where recess 80 is configured to permit compensation for vertical height shifts or changes in ground surface 404 to occur between or along blocks 60.
    </p>
    <p num="39">

      In FIG. 7(b), rail 14(a) engages and fits most preferably in recess 80(c) owing to the large distance between top rail 14(a) and ground surface 404; top rails 14(b) and 14(c) most preferably fit within and engage recesses 80(b) and 80(a), respectively.
      <br/>
      Rails 14(a) through 14(c) also preferably bias or grip block 60 downwardly or in proximity to ground surface 404 through the combined action of the downwardly angled ribs of top rails 14(a), 14(b) and 14(c) and corresponding recesses 80(a), 80(b) and 80(c).

    <p num="49">
      Blocks 60 shown in FIGS. 9(a) through 9(c) need not form a flat, substantially smooth surface for engaging ground surface 404.

      Instead, the various bottom surfaces 64 shown in FIGS. 9(a) through 9(c) provide vertical support for blocks 60 on ground surface 404 using legs 65 and 66, while recesses 80 extend downwardly from bodies 61 of blocks 60 for suitable engagement with top rails 14.
      <br/>
      The blocks shown in FIGS. 9(a) through 9(l) may provide landscape blocks of lighter weight.
      <br/>
      Additionally, those blocks generally require less material for their manufacture than do the blocks of FIGS. 1 through 8.
      <br/>
      Other methods and configurations for coring out block 60 to reduce weight and the amount of material required for its formation will now become apparent to those of skill in the art, such as those where bottom surface 65 is flat or substantially flat, but block 60 is nevertheless cored.

Adjoining blocks 60 may interconnect by having adjoining surfaces that: (a) overlappingly engage one another; (b) laterally or horizontally engage one another; (c) both laterally and overlappingly engage one another; (d) vertically engage one another only, and do not overlap either overlappingly or laterally, and (e) otherwise engage, abut or rest propinquant to one another.</p>
    <p num="54">
      For example, as shown in FIG. 10(a), each block 60 may have relatively short length 77, correspondingly shaped vertical surfaces 68(a) and 68(b) and correspondingly shaped horizontal surfaces 72(a) and 72(b) for matingly or overlappingly engaging adjoining blocks 60.
      <br/>
      Short length 77 permits joints between adjoining blocks 60 to be less obvious than they would otherwise appear in the presence of rapid or large changes in the slope of ground 404.

    <p num="55">
      FIG. 10(b) shows compound lap joints in blocks 60 of the present invention, where adjoining vertical surfaces 68(a) and 68(b) are convex and concave, respectively, and horizontal surfaces 72(a) and 72(b) overlap one another.
      <br/>
      Like blocks 60 in FIG. 10(a), relatively large variations in elevation in ground surface 404 do not cause large or unsightly joints or cracks to appear between adjoining blocks 60 in FIG. 10(b).

    <p num="56">
      Alternatively, adjoining blocks 60 may have not only complementary shapes for engaging one another, but other structural features for positively securing one block to the next.
      <br/>
      For example, blocks 60 may have corresponding holes 77 and vertically-oriented pins 78 having optional tips 79 for engaging one another as shown in FIGS. 10(l) through 10(q) and 10(w).
      <br/>
      Blocks 60 may have horizontally-oriented pins 78, as shown in FIG. 10(x).

    <p num="57">
      Another means of interconnecting blocks 60 of the present invention is by corresponding slot and tab means.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments of the present invention, adjoining or interconnecting blocks 60 may rotate at least slightly in respect of one another, thereby permitting blocks 60 to form a curved or winding border or barrier.

      <br/>
      At least one attachment member 32 has recess 80 formed therein.
      <br/>
      The cross-sectional shape of recess 80 corresponds to at least a portion of the predetermined cross-sectional shape of upper portion 7 of anchoring member 12.

      <br/>
      In FIGS. 14(m) through 14(q) and 14(r) through 14(v) tool 190 is employed to form twin trenches 195 for receiving undersides 64 of blocks 60 therein, and edging member 10 has no or substantially no bottom barrier extending downwardly therefrom.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 14(w) through 14(aa), no tool 190 is employed to form trenches 195.
      <br/>
      Instead, stakes 76 are driven through top rail 14 having no or substantially no bottom barrier extending downwardly therefrom, no trench is dug or excavated, and blocks 60 are disposed atop top rail 14 once stake 76 has been driven through the top surface of top rail 14.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 14(bb) and 14(cc), and FIGS. 14(dd) and 14(ee), tool 190 may or may not be employed to form twin trenches 195 for receiving undersides 64 of block 60 therewithin.

    <p num="113">
      In FIG. 14(ff), cutting member 197 is a disk, forms a portion of device 190, is received by or attached to handle 198.
      <br/>
      As a user pushes device 190 along surface 404 using handle 198, cutting member 197 slices into ground 400 and forms trench 195.
      <br/>
      Footrest 199 permits device 190 to be pushed along top rail with relative ease.
      <br/>
      FIG. 14(gg) shows a cross-sectional view of FIG. 14(ff).
      <br/>
      FIG. 14(hh) shows a variant of the invention shown in FIGS. 14(ff) and 14(gg).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 14(ii), disk or cutting member 197 may be stowed in a sideways storage position against handle 198 when not in use.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 14(hh), pin 194 may be employed to interconnect disk 197, frame 193, and optional foot rest 199.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      Device 190 may, of course, be motorized simply enough be providing an appropriate internal combustion or electric motor and corresponding transmission means for driving cutting member 197 or for pushing device 190 forwardly.
      <br/>
      For example, known rotary tilling machines may be modified in accordance with the teachings presented herein to replace their rotary tilling blades and means with a rotating trench formation blade 197 which cuts trench 195 in soil 400.
      <br/>
      Optionally, such a motorized device may be driven forwardly by motorized drive means as trench 195 is cut.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      Disks having different diameters may be received by device 190 to permit trenches having different depths to be formed as shown in FIGS. 14(jj) through 14(mm).
      <br/>
      Trench formation device 190 may be configured to accommodate different size disks or cutting members 197 as shown in FIGS. 14(ll) and 14(oo).
      <br/>
      FIGS. 14(nn) and 14(pp) show grooved roller 196 which may be included in device 190.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that disk 197 have a V-shaped or wedge-shaped cross-section such that it forms a trench having a top portion of greater width than the bottom portion.
      <br/>
      Following formation of trench 195 by device 190, the bottommost portion of edging barrier 20 may be placed at the bottom of trench 195, the trench backfilled to secure barrier 20 in ground 400, and the bottom surface of each block 60 placed on top rail 14 such that top rail 14 is received in recess 80.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      FIGS. 14(tt) and 14(uu) show another means of adjusting the depth of trench 195, where locking teeth 202 in hub 203 permit variable height arms 201 to be locked into various positions respecting one another.
      <br/>
      The greater the angles arms 202 form respecting ground surface 404, the greater the height device 190 assumes respecting ground surface 404, and the shallower disk 197 cuts into soil 400.
      <br/>
      Foot rest 199 may also act as a trench depth limiting device by defining the depth to which cutting member 197 may penetrate the ground.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      FIGS. 14(qq) through 14(ss) show another embodiment of trench formation device 190, where device 190 has front or rear rollers or skids 207 for guiding disk 197 in a desired direction.
      <br/>
      Foot rest 199 may be disposed atop or to the rear of disk 197.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      As shown in FIGS. 14(nn) through 14(pp), foot rests 199 may also form pegs or push bars extending laterally and outwardly away from frame 193 and disk 197.
      <br/>
      Handle 198 may also be formed to curve backwardly toward a user to aid the user in assuming a correct position for pushing device 190 in a forward direction.
      <br/>
      Grooved rollers 196 may help prevent compression of trench 195.
