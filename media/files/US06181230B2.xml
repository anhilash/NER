      <br/>
      A coil for use in the voltage section of the electromagnet in electromechanical utility watthour meters comprises a thermoplastic bobbin, a length of wire, and two terminals.
      <br/>
      The bobbin has an upper flange and a lower flange connected by a central, hollow core.
      <br/>
      The upper flange supports two terminal mounting boxes in which terminals are inserted.
      <br/>
      The first and second leads (i.e., wire ends) are electrically and mechanically isolated from each other in order for the coil to withstand high voltage power surges.
      <br/>
      The upper flange also supports a step that has a recessed, side profile that guides the path of the wire to the core without introducing sharp bends or turns into the wire.
      <br/>
      Excess length of the first and second ends of the wire length are secured to tie off posts that are located on the top of the terminal mounting boxes.
      <br/>
      These posts, along with the excess wire, are removed when the terminals are inserted into the mounting boxes.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates in general to electromechanical utility watthour meters.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to voltage coils for use in such meters.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      A voltage coil is an essential component in the electromagnet section of an electromechanical utility watthour meter.
      <br/>
      Voltage coils typically comprise three primary elements: a bobbin composed of an electrically inert material, wire capable of generating a magnetic field, and isolated terminal or wire ends.
      <br/>
      A voltage coil is also encapsulated prior to final testing.
      <br/>
      The manufacture of conventional voltage coils is labor intensive and these voltage coils are typically not able to handle large voltages; e.g., those on the order of about 8,000 volts.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      FIG. 1A shows a top view of a conventional voltage coil.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1B shows a bottom view (without attached terminals) and FIG. 1C shows a side cross-sectional view of the conventional voltage coil of FIG. 1A. In manufacturing a conventional voltage coil, one end of a wire 5, such as copper, is captured in a terminal, then an operator inserts a terminal 10 into a first or start terminal mounting box 15 that is part of a bobbin 2.
      <br/>
      The wire 5 is guided around the box 15 and through a slot 17 in an upper flange 20 and wrapped around the core 25 of the bobbin 2 a predetermined number of times or windings.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the bobbin 2 also comprises a lower flange 22, and the wire 5 is wound around the core 25 between the upper flange 20 and the lower flange 22.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      After the wire has been wound the predetermined number of windings, a piece of tape is applied to keep the wire from unwinding.
      <br/>
      The wire is again captured in a second or end terminal 30 and the end terminal 30 is then inserted into a second or end terminal mounting box 35.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1A, the wire 5 is shown as a dashed line toward its starting and ending points.
      <br/>
      The voltage coil is then sent for the subsequent steps of testing and encapsulation.
      <br/>
      The winding of the conventional voltage coil is labor intensive, and has a long manufacture cycle which leads to low productivity and high cost.
      <br/>
      Also, the encapsulation of the conventional voltage material uses a thermoset material which leads to a long cure time, poor yield, low productivity, and high cost.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,774,036, entitled "Bobbin-Mounted Solenoid Coil and Method of Making", issued to Hrytzak et al., describes a solenoid coil in which a magnet wire (MW) is wrapped around a bobbin core (24) and terminals (84, 86) are inserted into terminal sockets to connect to the magnet wire (MW).
      <br/>
      The solenoid coil is used in very low voltage applications, such as those in automotive vehicles (about 12 volts), and cannot be used in high voltage or electromagnet applications because the terminals are spaced too close together, thus resulting in the starting and ending points of the wire being close together.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that a solenoid is different from an electromagnet.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Although the art of voltage coils is well developed, there remain some problems inherent in this technology, particularly the ability for small coils having very fine magnet wire to handle high voltages.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a need exists for a voltage coil that overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <p num="11">
      In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, the first end of the wire extends from the first terminal through the first lower slot, around and within the grooved step channel of the upper flange through the slot, to the core.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the grooved step channel comprises radial edges to minimize bends in the wire.
    </p>

    <p num="13">
      In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, the bobbin further comprises a removable first tie off post disposed on the first terminal mounting box and a removable second tie off post disposed on the second terminal mounting box.
      <br/>
      The first and second tie off posts are used for securing a wire.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the first terminal mounting box has a first lower slot and a first upper slot, and the second terminal mounting box has a second lower slot and a second upper slot, and the slots are used for guiding the wire from the first and second tie off posts to the core.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS AND BEST MODE</heading>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 2 is a top view of an exemplary bobbin for use in a voltage coil section in an electromagnet in accordance with the present invention, FIG. 3 illustrates a side cross-sectional view of the bobbin of FIG. 2 taken along line 3--3 of FIG. 2, and FIG. 4 is a side cross-sectional view of the bobbin of FIG. 2 taken along line 4--4 of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The bobbin 101 comprises an upper flange 105, a lower flange 110, and a core 115.
      <br/>
      The core 115 connects the upper flange 105 and the lower flange 110.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The upper flange 105 supports a pair of terminal mounting boxes 130, 135 which each have an opening to receive a terminal.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the terminal mounting boxes 130, 135 are located at approximately one-quarter of the circumference of upper flange 105.
      <br/>
      One or more steps or channels are disposed on the upper flange 105.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, there are two steps 140, 142, as shown in the figures.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 illustrates a bottom view of the upper flange 105 of the bobbin 101 of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The upper flange 105 has a notch or slot 145 that runs from the outer edge of the flange 105 to the core 115.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The bobbin 101 preferably comprises a thermoplastic material, for example, Zytel.RTM. 70G33HS1L, manufactured by Dupont, which is a 33% glass filled, heat stabilized nylon 6/6.
      <br/>
      This material has less fiberglass filler than the thermoplastic material used in conventional bobbins and extends the life of tooling and processing equipment, thereby providing a better quality voltage coil possessing higher repeatability and shorter cycle times in manufacturing.
      <br/>
      The material also eliminates secondary deflashing operations.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the core 115 is hollow, centered, and square shaped, although any shape core can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Removable or disposable tie off posts 150, 155 are disposed on the terminal mounting boxes 130, 135, respectively.
      <br/>
      The tie off posts 150, 155 can be used to provide tension to the wire during and after winding and before the terminals are installed.
      <br/>
      The tie off posts can also be used in the positioning of the wire, which are provided during the subsequent manufacture of the voltage coil.
      <br/>
      As described further below, the start or first end of the wire is wrapped around the tie off post 150 prior to the wire being wound around the core 115, and the finish or second end of the wire is wrapped around the tie off post 155 at the completion of the wire being wound around the core.
      <br/>
      The tie off posts 150, 155 are removed after, or at approximately the same time, the terminals are inserted into the terminal mounting boxes 130, 135.
      <br/>
      Although posts are shown and described as the preferred embodiment, it is understood that any wire securement means can be used, such as a hook or flange.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 6 illustrates an enlarged cross-sectional view of one of the terminal mounting boxes of FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Each terminal mounting box has a slot on the top surface and the bottom surface.
      <br/>
      The terminal mounting box 130 has a slot 132 on the top surface and a slot 134 on the bottom surface, and the terminal mounting box 135 has a slot 137 on the top surface and a slot 139 on the bottom surface.
      <br/>
      As described in further detail below, the slots 132, 134 of the terminal mounting box 130 allow the first end of the wire to be attached to the tie off post 150 and gradually wound around the grooved step 140 on the upper flange 105 of the bobbin 101 prior to being wound around the core 115.
      <br/>
      Thus, the terminal mounting box 130 routes the wire from the tie off post 150 to the core 115 of the bobbin 101.
      <br/>
      The slots 137, 139 of the second terminal mounting box 135 allow the second end of the wire to pass from the core 115 to the tie off post 155 after the winding is completed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the terminal mounting box 135 routes the wire from the last winding on the core to a tie off post 155.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The terminal mounting box 130 isolates the starting portion of the wire from the windings around the core 115.
      <br/>
      The terminal mounting box 135 keeps the ending portion of the wire isolated from the windings around the core 115.
      <br/>
      The terminal boxes 130 and 135 are spaced a sufficient distance apart so that the terminals 180 and 185, and their associated ending portions of the wire, remain electrically and mechanically isolated, even for very high voltages, such as about 8,000 volts.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      FIG. 7 illustrates a cross-sectional view of an exemplary voltage coil in accordance with the present invention, before terminals are added to the terminal mounting boxes 130, 135 and the tie off posts 150, 155 have been removed.
      <br/>
      A magnet wire 175, such as insulated copper wire, is wound around the bobbin core 115 a predetermined number of times or windings, between the upper flange 105 and the lower flange 110.
      <br/>
      After the wire 175 is wound, terminals 180, 185 are inserted into the terminal mounting boxes 130, 135, respectively.
      <br/>
      The insertion of the terminals 180, 185 into the boxes 130, 135 penetrates or crimps the wire 175 at the ends near the tie off posts 150, 155.
      <br/>
      The wire between the terminal 180 and the tie off post 150 is removed, as is the wire between the terminal 185 and the tie off post 155, along with the tie off posts 150, 155 because they no longer provide tension to the wire 175.
      <br/>
      The termination of the wire ends is preferably performed via automation.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 8 illustrates a top view of an exemplary voltage coil in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 8, the terminals 180, 185 have been inserted into the terminal mounting boxes 130, 135 and the tie off posts have been removed.
      <br/>
      Although any terminal can be used, it is desirable that the end of each terminal that is inserted into the terminal mounting box has serrations 190, as shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B, which show a top view and a side view, respectively, of an exemplary serrated terminal in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The terminal, in its preferred embodiment, possesses a plurality of serrations 190 on its underside that crimp and terminate the start and finish ends of the wire 175 (e.g., a mini MAG-MATE terminal, manufactured by AMP, Inc.).
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      An exemplary voltage coil, for use in an electromagnet, in accordance with the present invention is fabricated by attaching a first end of the wire 175 to the tie off post 150.
      <br/>
      The wire 175 is then passed through upper slot 132 and lower slot 134, and then is routed along the perimeter of step 140.
      <br/>
      The step 140 preferably has a grooved recess 141 that provides a guided and secured path for the wire 175.
      <br/>
      The wire 175 is then passed through the notch or slot 145 to the core 115.
      <br/>
      The wire 175 is wound around the core 115 a predetermined number of times or windings, preferably by an automated winding machine.
      <br/>
      After the wire 175 has been wound, the end of the wire is passed through the lower slot 139 and the upper slot 137 of the terminal box 135.
      <br/>
      The end of the wire is then secured to the tie off post 155.
      <br/>
      By securing the two ends of the wire 175 to the tie off posts 150, 155, the wire 175 is provided with tension.
      <br/>
      The terminals 180, 185 are inserted into terminal mounting boxes 130, 135, respectively.
      <br/>
      The terminals 180, 185 crimp the ends of the wire.
      <br/>
      The tie off posts 150, 155 are removed, along with the excess wire between the tie off posts and the point of terminal penetration or crimping, either during the penetrating or shortly thereafter.
      <br/>
      The wound bobbin is ready for the subsequent steps of encapsulation and high voltage test.
      <br/>
      An encapsulating layer (not shown) preferably comprises a thermoplastic material such as Zytel.RTM., as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      As described, in a preferred embodiment, the bobbin in accordance with the present invention is used for automated fabrication of a voltage coil section of an electromagnet.

      Thus, the start wire is concealed from the rest of the coil for optimum isolation which is desirable for high voltage applications to avoid failure.
      <br/>
      The guided path of the first end of the wire also reduces surge failures because a primary opportunity for failure is the critical area between the start lead and the rest of the coil where the outermost layer is technically the second end.
      <br/>
      The guided path also eliminates the stress-inducing sharp turns encountered by the first end in the conventional voltage coils, yet still allows the coil to meet rigid, high voltage test criteria.
      <br/>
      In addition, the bobbin flange material is of sufficient thickness (preferably about 0.050 inches) and dielectric properties to provide extra insulation in the critical area.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the magnet wire itself is preferably laminated to provide additional insulation between the turns and layers.

      Thus, the voltage coil in accordance with the present invention provides a more efficient, less labor-intensive, and higher yield device that can be made by an automated manufacturing process, thereby decreasing the cost of the voltage coil.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the voltage coil is capable of handling high voltage, on the order of about 8,000 volts.
