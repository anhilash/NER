      Neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) and macrophages play a major role in the body's defense against harmful foreign pathogens.
      <br/>
      In the course of serving this function, phagocytes must respond to a variety of inflammatory stimulants, including N-formylated peptides, complement component C5a, leukotriene B4 platelet-activating factor, and interleukin 8 (see, e.g., Becker, J. Leukocyte Biol. 47: 378-389 (1990)).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Phagocytes have specific cell surface receptors for these factors that are coupled to the intracellular environment through oligomeric GTP-binding proteins, which are also known as G proteins.
      <br/>
      These transducing elements are found in all cells and couple ligand-activated receptors to the intracellular second messenger cascades (Birnbaumer, et al., CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 25: 225-244 (1990)).
      <br/>
      Protein purification and molecular cloning have revealed the existence of multiple additional G proteins that bear homology with the ras oncogene products (Der, in Oncogenes, Benz &amp; Liu (eds), Kluweer Academic, Boston, Mass., 1989, pp. 73-119; Hall, Science 249: 635-640 (1990)).
      <br/>
      These smaller monomeric proteins are referred to herein as low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins (LMWGs).
      <br/>
      Recent findings have implicated the LMWGs in a variety of neutrophil activities.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One of these activities is the eradication of disease-causing organisms.
      <br/>
      For example, the phagocytic cell NADPH oxidase generates superoxide anion (O2-) as a means to destroy ingested microorganisms.
      <br/>
      Its importance in bacterial killing is evidenced by the chronic infections and even death observed in patients with severe neutropenia, chronic granulomatous disease, and other disorders of neutrophil function.
      <br/>
      However, the inappropriate or excessive formation of O2- and its byproducts can both initiate and exacerbate inflammation.
      <br/>
      Inflammatory diseases and/or secondary inflammation resulting from a primary disorder are serious health problems.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the development of means to intervene in this process in a specific manner is of great therapeutic interest.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Human neutrophils and other phagocytic cells undergo a respiratory burst in which superoxide anion (O2-) and its metabolites--hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2), hypochlorous and other hypohalous acids, and hydroxyl radical (OH)--are produced as a means of destroying ingested microorganisms.
      <br/>
      The significance of the respiratory burst in host defense is made evident by the recurrent and life-threatening infections that occur in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in whose phagocytes the burst does not occur.
      <br/>
      It is known that CGD results from genetic defects in any one of four known protein components of the NADPH oxidase enzyme responsible for generating O2- (see J. T. Curnutte, in Phagocytic Defects II: Abnormalities of the Respiratory Burst (vol. 2), J. T. Curnutte (ed.), Saunders, Philadelphia, pp. 241-252 (1988)).
      <br/>
      Studies with various cell-free oxidase activation systems (Curnutte, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 262: 450 (1987); Bromberg, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 220: 13539 (1985)) and cellular material from CGD patients have helped to determine the identity and function of the components of the NADPH oxidase.
      <br/>
      The oxidase is composed of membrane-bound proteins that include cytochrome bass and possibly a 45 kD flavoprotein, as well as cytosolic components, of which two have been characterized: p47�phox� and p67�phox� (Clark, J. Infect. Dis. 161: 1140 (1990); Smith and Curnutte, Blood 77: 673 (1991)).
      <br/>
      The NADPH oxidase is activated at least in part by the association of these components into a membrane-bound complex that can transfer electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen, generating O2- (Clark, Id.; Smith and Curnutte, Id.).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      GTP-binding proteins have recently been implicated in the regulation of NADPH oxidase activity.
      <br/>
      GTP appears to be required for oxidase activation in cell-free systems and GDP analogs inhibit this activation. (See, e.g., Gabig, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 262: 1685 (1987); Seifert, et al., FEBS Lett. 205: 161 (1986); Uhlinger, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266: 20990-997 (1991); Pereri, et al., PNAS USA 89: 2494-98 (1992).) It has also been observed that inhibition of protein isoprenylation decreases the rate of O2- generation. (See, e.g., Knaus, et al., Science 254: 1512-1515 (1991); Bokoch and Prossnitz, J. Clin. Invest. 89: 402-408 (1992)); and Chuang, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 775-778 (1993).)
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      NADPH oxidase can be activated in cell-free systems containing cytosol and membranes from unstimulated phagocytes by the addition of an anionic amphiphile such as arachidonate or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). (See, e.g., Curnutte, J. Clin. Invest. 75: 1740-1743 (1985); Bromberg and Pick, Cell.
      <br/>
      Immunol. 88: 213-221 (1984); McPhail, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 75: 1735-1739 (1985).) Several reports have shown that GTP or one of its non-hydrolyzable analogs (e.g., guanosine 5'-o-(3-thiotriphosphate) or GTP GAMMA S) may cause a two- to four-fold enhancement in the rate of O2- generation by these systems (Gabig, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 262: 1685-1690 (1987); Seifert, et al., FEBS Lett. 205: 161-165 (1986)).
      <br/>
      More recently, we have demonstrated that there is an absolute requirement for GTP (or GTP GAMMA S) in the cell-free system (Uhlinger, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266: 20990-20997 (1991); Peveri, et al., PNAS USA 89: 2494-2498 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Moreover, the NADPH oxidase activity of differentiated HL-60 cells is dependent upon prenylation of a cytosolic component (Bokoch and Prossnitz, J. Clin. Invest. 89: 402-408 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Taken together, this evidence is strongly indicative of a role for a GTP-binding protein in NADPH oxidase activation.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Two very closely related members of the Rho family of Ras-like LMWGs have recently been implicated in the regulation of NADPH oxidase.
      <br/>
      We purified Rac2 from human neutrophil cytosol on the basis of its ability both to bind GTP GAMMA S and stimulate O2- generation in the presence of a suboptimal amount of neutrophil cytosol (Knaus, et al., Science 254: 1512-1515 (1991); Knaus, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 23575-23582 (1992)).
      <br/>
      In similar experiments using guinea pig peritoneal macrophages, Rac1 was purified in an oxidase-enhancing complex (termed  DELTA 1) with Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI). (See, e.g., Abo, et al., Nature 353: 668-670 (1991).) Subsequently, Mizuno, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 10215-10218 (1992) also purified Rac2 from differentiated HL-60 cells, a human myeloid cell line, and confirmed that it enhances NADPH oxidase activity in a cell-free assay.
      <br/>
      A different approach was taken by Dorseuil and colleagues (J.
      <br/>
      Biol. Chem. 267: 20540-20542 (1992)), who used Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes that produce O2- by an NADPH oxidase system similar (and perhaps identical) to the one in phagocytic cells.
      <br/>
      They showed that rac antisense (but not sense) oligonucleotides decreased the Rac protein content of the cells and inhibited O2- generation in a dose-dependent manner, thus confirming the physiological role of Rac proteins in the regulation of NADPH oxidase activity.
      <br/>
      Rac1 and Rac2 are 92% identical and both undergo post-translational modification by the addition of a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl group to the cysteine of the carboxy-terminal CAAX box (Kinsella, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266: 9786-9794 (1991)).
      <br/>
      Rac1 is expressed in a wide variety of cell types, whereas Rac2 is apparently restricted to cells of myeloid and lymphoid origin (Didsbury, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264: 16378-16382 (1989); Reibel, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 175: 451-458 (1991)).

    </p>
    <p num="13">
      One likely mechanism of action is the direct inhibition of activation of the specific enzymes/proteins involved in the oxidative burst of phagocytic cells, by binding to critical components of this system within phagocytic cells.
      <br/>

      ICS4 and ARF peptides are now shown to be capable of inhibiting O2- production in the within-described assays.
      <br/>
      Their O2- -inhibiting activity may be related to the fact that these peptides possess a two- or three-dimensional structure similar to that of the active Rac peptides.

      However, they are not derived from Rac themselves which suggests that it is possible to design effective peptides once the structural basis for inhibitory actions of the Rac peptides is better understood.

    <p num="36">
      FIG. 1 illustrates inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity by various peptides in dose/response conditions. Percent inhibition is plotted against concentration of peptide in  MU M. Closed triangles (1) represent mastoparan; closed circles (2) represent Racl COOH-terminal peptide aa178-188; open squares (3) represent CDC42 COOH-terminal peptide; closed squares (4) represent Gi-2 control; and open triangles (5) represent Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide aa161-172.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 illustrates that the activity of Rac1 peptide can be retained by a peptide as small as 6 amino acids in length. Percent inhibition is plotted against concentration in  MU M. Closed circles represent Rac1 11-mer peptide; closed squares represent Rac1 9-mer peptide; closed triangles represent Rac1 6-mer peptide; open circles represent Rac2 11-mer peptide; and open squares represent Rac2 9-mer peptide.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 illustrates the effect of p190 GAP on NADPH oxidase activity in the presence and absence of GTP GAMMA S. The concentration of p190 GAP (in  MU M; horizontal axis) is plotted against superoxide production (percent of control activity; vertical axis). Recombinant p190 GAP was added to reaction mixtures to give the final concentrations indicated, one minute prior to activation of O2- production with SDS. Reaction mixtures contained 4 * 105 cell eq membranes and 1.8 * 106 cell eq of either normal cytosol (open circles, closed circles) or dialyzed cytosol (closed triangles). The final concentrations of endogenous GTP contributed by this amount of normal and dialyzed cytosol were 2.8  MU M and &lt;0.02  MU M, respectively. Reactions were either performed at 2.8  MU M GTP (open circles), or were supplemented with 10  MU M GTP GAMMA S (closed circles, closed triangles). The control rate of O2- production was 26.7 +- 3.2 (S.D., n=4) nmol/min/107 cell eq membranes. Data shown are representative of at least two experiments.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 illustrates the ability of mastoparan and analogs to stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange (GDP/GTP exchange) on Rac2 protein (closed circles), as well as to inhibit NADPH oxidase (open circles). The concentration of the peptide is indicated on the horizontal axis (in  MU M), whereas percent inhibition or percent stimulation are indicated on the vertical axis.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 illustrates the effects of mastoparan and its analogs on NADPH inhibition, ascertained via determination of O2- production in a cell-free system. Data for mastoparan (closed circles), mastoparan X (open circles), mastoparan Polistes (closed triangles), and mastoparan 3 (closed squares) are shown, with peptide concentration (in  MU M) indicated on the horizontal axis and percent inhibition on the vertical axis.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 illustrates the inhibition of NADPH oxidase by antibodies to various peptides described herein. Antibodies specific to Rac2 (closed circles), to Rac1 (open circles), to CDC42Hs Ap1 (open squares), to an undefined neutrophil surface antigen (NSA, open triangles) were tested, as was the buffer in which the affinity-purified antibodies were dissolved (closed squares).

The amount of p190 GAP (in  MU M) is plotted on the horizontal axis, whereas the percent of � GAMMA 32 P�GTP bound is plotted on the vertical axis. Rac1 (open and closed squares) or Rac2 (open and closed circles) was loaded with � GAMMA 32 P�GTP, and GTP hydrolysis initiated in the presence of the indicated concentrations of p190, as described in Methods (Example 4 herein).

Time (in minutes; horizontal axis) is plotted against absorbance at 550 nm (vertical axis). Reaction mixtures contained 4 * 105 cell eq membranes and 1.8 * 106 cell eq of normal cytosol. Recombinant p190 GAP was added to reaction mixtures to give a final concentration of 350 nM either one minute before (closed, upright triangles) or 1.7 or 5 minutes after (closed, inverted triangles) the initiation of the reaction at 0 minutes with SDS (110  MU M). In control reactions, buffer (open squares) or diphenylene iodonium (DPI, final concentration 1  MU M, open circles) was added to ongoing reactions 1.7 (not shown for DPI) or 5 minutes after initiation.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="37">
      It is now possible to inhibit the activation of NADPH oxidase and other enzyme systems involved in the oxidative burst of phagocytic cells via use of molecules derived from or homologous to GTP-binding proteins, particularly low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins (LMWG), including analogs and peptides derived therefrom.
      <br/>
      It is anticipated that molecules which specifically inhibit or otherwise regulate GDP/GTP exchange are also useful in this regard.
      <br/>
      Examples of useful molecules include mastoparan, mastoparan analogs, low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins (LMWG), and LMWG analogs, including optionally substituted peptide derivatives of LMWGs such as Rac1, Rac2, Rap1A, Rap1B, Rab3, and ARF.

      Polypeptides

    <p num="56">
      A polypeptide of the present invention is at least about 6, and preferably not more than about 100, amino acids in length.
      <br/>
      Other preferred polypeptides are about 6 to about 40, and more preferably no more than about 25 to 30, amino acid residues in length.
      <br/>
      Useful polypeptides according to the present invention may also be about 6 to about 20 amino acids in length.
      <br/>
      In all instances, polypeptides of the present invention are capable of inhibiting oxidase activity or are capable of displaying GAP activity.
      <br/>
      Preferred polypeptides of the present invention are tolerant of various modifications (e.g., insertions, substitutions, and deletions), to the extent that such modifications do not destroy a particular peptide's ability to inhibit oxidase activity or to display GAP activity.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      A polypeptide of the present invention may also be characterized as having an amino acid residue sequence homologous to or derived from the functional region of a larger polypeptide or protein displaying GAP activity or oxidase inhibitory activity.
      <br/>
      For example, a peptide according to the present invention may be homologous to the Rac2-COOH terminal region, as discussed further in Section II.B. below.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      A polypeptide according to the present invention may include any analog, fragment or chemical derivative of a polypeptide whose amino acid residue sequence is shown herein so long as the polypeptide is capable of inhibiting the activation of oxidative enzyme systems, e.g., NADPH oxidase systems, in a manner corresponding to that of LMWG peptides or proteins, or peptides and proteins exhibiting GAP activity.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a polypeptide of the present invention can be subject to various changes, substitutions, insertions, and deletions where such changes provide for certain advantages in its use. (See Section II.B. below.)
    </p>
    <p num="59">The term "fragment" refers to any subject polypeptide having an amino acid residue sequence shorter than that of a polypeptide whose amino acid residue sequence is shown herein.</p>
    <p num="60">
      Preferred peptides according to the present invention include peptides which are capable of GTP/GDP regulatory activity.
      <br/>
      In particular, GTP-binding proteins and their analogs are ideal candidates and sources of useful peptides.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      One group of useful peptides is derived from the Ras superfamily.
      <br/>
      There are a number of common features among the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins.
      <br/>
      These common features include structural similarities; for example, all Ras-related proteins have a conserved guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis domain. (See, e.g., Valencia, et al., Biochemistry 30: 4637-4648 (1991).) Second, all Ras-related proteins undergo post-translational processing by isoprenylation (C20 or 15) and/or palmitylation.
      <br/>
      In addition, many of the Ras-related proteins are truncated and/or carboxymethylated.
      <br/>
      Finally, the C-terminal CAAX motif is most common.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The post-translationally modified C terminus of the Ras-related proteins is also known to be important for the membrane association of those proteins, as well as for their biological activity.
      <br/>
      There are also a variety of extrinsic regulatory proteins including GAP (GTPase activating protein), GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) and GDS (GDP/GTP dissociation stimulator).
      <br/>
      The binding of GDI and/or GDS requires C terminal processing and can regulate whether the GTP binding protein is membrane associated or cytosolic.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      GAPs, GDSs, and GDIs are capable of modulating the GTP/GDP state of Rac (Bokoch and Der, FASEB J. 7: 750-759 (1993)).
      <br/>
      GAPs stimulate GTP hydrolysis, while GDSs promote the exchange of GTP for GDP.
      <br/>
      GDIs inhibit GDP dissociation from Rac, but GDIs are also able to inhibit the intrinsic GTP hydrolytic activity of Rac, as well as that stimulated by GAPS. (See also Chuang, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 775-778 (1993).)
    </p>
    <p num="64">The presence of �Rho�GDI in human neutrophils and other phagocytes is well established, and a Rac GDS activity has also been detected. (See, e.g., Knaus, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 23575-223582 (1992); Kwong, et al., Biochemistry 32: 5711-5717 (1993); Abo, et al., Nature 353: 668-670 (1991); and Heyworth, et al., Mol. Biol. Cell 4: 261-269 (1993).) (�Rho�GDI refers to a GDI originally described to be active on Rho (Ueda, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265: 9373-9380 (1990)) but which now is known to be active on other members of the Rho family.)</p>
    <p num="65">
      The addition of exogenous �Rho�GDI and smgGDS to cell-free oxidase systems has demonstrated that these proteins can regulate NADPH oxidase activity, probably through effects on Rac to prevent or stimulate GTP/GDP exchange, respectively. (See Mizuno, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 10215-10218 (1992).) Regulatory roles for Rac GAPs in the oxidase system have not been described.
      <br/>
      Since there is evidence that GAPs might act as downstream effectors as well as negative regulators, at least in certain systems, the activities of GAP proteins remain to be determined for each particular protein.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      A variety of molecules with GAP activity for Rac have been described. (See Bokoch and Der, Id. (1992); Hall, et al., Cell 69: 389-391 (1992).) Among these are the p190 protein, which tightly associates with p120 Ras GAP upon activation of growth factor receptor and transforming tyrosine kinases (Ellis, et al., Nature 343: 377-381 (1990); Settleman, et al., Cell 69: 539-549 (1992); Settleman, et al., Nature 359: 153-154 (1992)) and a distinct GAP, termed CDC42 GAP, that has activity for the Rac-related GTP-binding protein CDC42 (Hart, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266: 20840-20848 (1991)).
      <br/>
      This GAP appears to be identical to a previously identified Rho GAP (Garrett, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264: 10-13 (1989)).
      <br/>
      Although Rac GAP activity has been detected in human neutrophils (Bokoch, G. M., unpublished observation), the proteins that mediate this activity in human phagocytes have not yet been identified.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      It is demonstrated herein that p190 Rac GAP is present in human neutrophils and is able to inhibit NADPH oxidase activity in a cell-free O2- generating system.
      <br/>
      This inhibition appears to be the result of modulation of the GTP state of Rac and can be reversed by the addition of pre-activated forms of Rac.
      <br/>
      The use of p190 Rac GAP to investigate Rac in the active NADPH oxidase complex is also demonstrated herein, as is the usefulness of GAPs (and derivatives and analogs thereof) as NADPH oxidase inhibitors.
      <br/>
      Our findings also suggest that other proteins having activity similar to CDC42Hs would be useful inhibitors; these proteins include Bcr protein, Abr protein, and chimerins.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Rac1, Rac2, and related proteins are also the source of useful peptides.
      <br/>
      Rac1 and Rac2 are very closely-related members of the Rho family of Ras-like low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins which are implicated in the regulation of NADPH oxidase.
      <br/>
      Rac2 may be purified from human neutrophil cytosol on the basis of its ability both to bind GTP GAMMA S and to stimulate O2- generation in the presence of a suboptimal amount of neutrophil cytosol. (See, e.g., Knaus, et al., Science 254: 1512-1515 (1991); Knaus, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 23575-23582 (1992).) In similar experiments using guinea pig peritoneal macrophages, Rac1 was purified in an oxidase-enhancing complex (termed rho1) with Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI). (See, e.g., Abo, et al., Nature 353: 668-670 (1991).)
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Rac1 and Rac2 are 92% identical and both undergo posttranslational modification by the addition of a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl group to the cysteine of the carboxy-terminal CAAX box.
      <br/>
      Rac1 is expressed in a wide variety of cell types, whereas Rac2 is apparently restricted to cells of myeloid and lymphoid origin. (See, e.g., Didsbury, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264: 16378-16382 (1989); Reibel, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 175: 451-458 (1991).)
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      The importance of the C terminal region in oxidase regulation/activity is indicated by the following.
      <br/>
      First, the oxidase in the cells is inhibited by drugs which block isoprenylation.
      <br/>
      Second, inhibition by anti-peptide antibodies to Rac2 amino acids 178-188 (C terminus) is noted.
      <br/>
      Finally, inhibition by Rac1 and Rac2 C-terminal peptides is significant (see data described hereinbelow).
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The within-described research has allowed us to identify a key protein or proteins involved in NADPH oxidase activation in phagocytic cells.
      <br/>
      These proteins, including Rac2 and Rap1A--and perhaps Rac1 as well--regulate the activity of the NADPH oxidase in neutrophils and other cells, acting at key regulatory step in the activation pathway.
      <br/>
      The ability of peptide(s) representing the COOH terminal portion of Rac2 (and Rap1A) to inhibit activation of the NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system is disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      Such peptides may provide a means to specifically inhibit the activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, since Rac2 is found only in cells of myeloid origin.
      <br/>
      In addition, small molecular weight inhibitors other than peptides might be identified.
      <br/>
      The concept that the COOH terminal portion of these proteins is important for key regulatory interactions involved in NADPH oxidase activity is also disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      The use of such potentially specific inhibitors would provide a means to inhibit inappropriate phagocyte generation of oxygen radicals and alleviate inflammatory processes resulting from such activity.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      A rapidly growing superfamily of LMWGs is presently being identified via protein purification, immunological, and recombinant technologies (Der, in Oncogenes, Benz &amp; Liu (eds), Kluweer Academic, Boston, Mass., 1989, pp. 73-119; Hall, Science 249: 635-640 (1990); Santos, et al., FASEB J. 3: 2151-2163 (1989); and Downward, Trends Biochem.
      <br/>
      Sci. 15: 469-472 (1990)).
      <br/>
      This superfamily currently consists of approximately 50 monomeric proteins in the size range of about 18-28 kilodaltons (kDa).
      <br/>
      Based on primary sequence, these proteins have been subdivided into three major families.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The ras oncogene products were the original LMWGs to be discovered and are the most extensively studied.
      <br/>
      The 21 kDa Ha-, Ki-, and N-Ras are believed to be involved in growth factor-mediated signal transduction, either by modulating known second messenger systems or by acting through a novel pathway or pathways. (See, e.g., Kaplan, et al., Cell 61: 125-133 (1990); Cantley, et al., Cell 64: 281-302 (1991); Quilliam, et al., Second Messengers Protein Phosphorylation 13: (1990); Gibbs, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265: 20437-20442 (1990); Smith, et al., Nature 320: 540-543 (1986); Yatani, et al., Cell 60: 769-776 (1990); and Okamoto, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266: 1085-1091 (1991).) The Ras family of LMWGs consists of an additional seven proteins that have approximately 50% homology with Ras.
      <br/>
      These include R-Ras (Lowe, et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 7: 2845-2856 (1987)), Ral A and B (Chardin, et al., NAR 17: 4380 (1989)), and the Rap subfamily (Pizon, et al., Oncogene 3: 201-4 (1988); Pizon, et al., NAR 16: 7719 (1988); Ohmstede, PNAS USA 87: 6527-6531 (1990)).
      <br/>
      The functions of the former are unknown, while the Rap proteins are believed to act antagonistically to Ras action and to phagocytic function(s).
      <br/>
      There are four Raps, including Rap1A and Rap1B, which are 95% homologous, and Rap2 and Rap2B, which share a 90% homology with each other and are about 70% homologous with Rap1A.
      <br/>
      Rap1A was independently cloned by several groups (Pizon, et al., Id.; Quilliam, et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 10: 2901-2908 (1990); and is also known as Krev-1 (Kitayama, Cell 56: 77-84 (1989)) and smg p21 (Kawata, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263: 19865-18971 (1988)).

      Suitable acids which are capable of forming salts with the peptides of the present invention include inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, perchloric acid, nitric acid, thiocyanic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, anthranilic acid, cinnamic acid, naphthalene sulfonic acid, sulfanilic acid or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="75">Suitable bases capable of forming salts with the peptides of the present invention include inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and the like; and organic bases such as mono-, di- and tri-alkyl and aryl amines (e.g. triethylamine, diisopropyl amine, methyl amine, dimethyl amine and the like) and optionally substituted ethanolamines (e.g. ethanolamine, diethanolamine and the like).</p>
    <p num="76">B. Peptide Analogs and Derivatives</p>
    <p num="77">
      The term "analog" includes any polypeptide having an amino acid residue sequence substantially identical to a sequence specifically shown herein in which one or more residues have been conservatively substituted with a functionally similar residue and which displays the ability to functionally mimic LMWG as described herein.
      <br/>
      Examples of conservative substitutions include the substitution of one non-polar (hydrophobic) residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another, the substitution of one polar (hydrophilic) residue for another such as between arginine and lysine, between glutamine and asparagine, between glycine and serine, the substitution of one basic residue such as lysine, arginine or histidine for another, or the substitution of one acidic residue, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid for another.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      "Conservative substitution" as used herein is meant to denote that one amino acid residue has been replaced by another, biologically or chemically similar residue.
      <br/>
      Examples of conservative substitutions include the substitution of one hydrophobic residue such as Ile, Val, Leu or Met for another, or the substitution of one polar residue for another such as between Arg and Lys, between Glu and Asp or between Gln and Asn, and the like.
      <br/>
      The term "conservative substitution" also includes the use of a substituted amino acid in place of an unsubstituted parent amino acid provided that such a polypeptide also displays the requisite binding activity.
      <br/>
      The phrase "conservative substitution" also includes the use of a chemically derivatized residue in place of a non-derivatized residue provided that such polypeptide displays the requisite binding activity.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      "Chemical derivative" refers to a subject polypeptide having one or more residues chemically derivatized by reaction of a functional side group.
      <br/>
      Such derivatized molecules include for example, those molecules in which free amino groups have been derivatized to form amine hydrochlorides, p-toluene sulfonyl groups, carbobenzoxy groups, t-butyloxycarbonyl groups, chloroacetyl groups or formyl groups.
      <br/>
      Free carboxyl groups may be derivatized to form salts, methyl and ethyl esters or other types of esters or hydrazides.
      <br/>
      Free hydroxyl groups may be derivatized to form O-acyl or O-alkyl derivatives.
      <br/>
      The imidazole nitrogen of histidine may be derivatized to form N-im-benzylhistidine.
      <br/>
      Also included as chemical derivatives are those peptides which contain one or more naturally occurring amino acid derivatives of the twenty standard amino acids.
      <br/>
      For examples: 4-hydroxyproline may be substituted for proline; 5-hydroxylysine may be substituted for lysine; 3-methylhistidine may be substituted for histidine; homoserine may be substituted for serine; and ornithine may be substituted for lysine.
      <br/>
      Polypeptides of the present invention also include any polypeptide having one or more additions and/or deletions or residues relative to the sequence of a polypeptide whose sequence is shown herein, so long as the requisite activity is maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      The peptide derivatives and analogs of the present invention include optionally-substituted peptides and polypeptide derivatives which block the production of superoxides and other toxic oxygen products in phagocytic cells.
      <br/>
      The sequence of the peptide derivatives or analogs may be linear or non-linear, albeit linear peptide derivatives or analogs represent a preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      A peptide derivative or analog of the present invention is at least about 3, more preferably 6, and no more than about 100, preferably no more than about 40, and more preferably no more than about 25 to 30, amino acid residues in length.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      It is also contemplated that addition of a certain class of chemical moieties selected from hydrophobic and amphipathic groups will enhance the penetration of the peptides, derivatives and analogs of the present invention into phagocytic cells.
      <br/>
      Addition of such moieties may also assist in the retention of such peptides, derivatives, and analogs within phagocytic cells.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Examples of such auxiliary groups and moieties include cleavable ester groups such as acetoxymethylester, which has been successfully used to modify hydrophilic, ionic chemical substances which may then pass through the lipid barrier of the cell exterior and into the interior of living cells and tissues. (See, e.g., Grynkiewicz, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260: 3440-3450 (1985), which is incorporated herein by reference.) When the peptides, derivatives, or analogs are to be used in warm-blooded animals, including humans, it is appreciated that the derivatization should not render the peptide derivatives toxic.
      <br/>
      Peptide derivatives with added chemical moieties as described above are considered pro-drugs for the active peptide derivatives or analogs.

      Methods for Producing A Subject Polypeptide, Derivative, or Analog
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      A subject polypeptide, derivative or analog can be prepared using recombinant nucleic acid methodologies well known in the art.
      <br/>
      For instance, DNA sequences useful in producing a subject polypeptide are described in Paik et al., PNAS USA 82: 3445-3449, (1985); McLean et al., J. Biol. Chem. 259: 6498-6504, (1984); and Rall et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257: 4171-4178, (1982).
      <br/>
      A DNA segment coding for a polypeptide of this invention can be synthesized by chemical techniques, for example the phosphotriester method of Matteucci et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103: 3185, (1981).
      <br/>
      The DNA segment can then be ligated into an expression vector, and a host transformed therewith can be used to produce the polypeptide.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Current Protocols In Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, N.Y.; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,237,224 and 4,356,270, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="88">The recombinant expression vectors capable of expressing a subject polypeptide and methods of their use for producing a subject polypeptide are contemplated as part of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="89">
      A polypeptide of the present invention can be synthesized by any of the peptide synthetic techniques known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      A summary of some of the techniques available can be found in J. Meinhofer, "Hormonal Proteins and Peptides" Vol. 2, pp. 46, Academic Press (New York) 1983, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,211, which description is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      When a polypeptide desired for use in the present invention is relatively short (less than about 40 amino acid residues in length) direct peptide synthetic techniques are generally favored, usually by employing a solid phase technique such as that initially described by Merrifield, in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85: 2149-2154 (1963).
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      Other polypeptide synthesis techniques may be found, for example, in M. Bodanszky et al., Peptide Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2d Ed., (1976) as well as in other reference works known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      A summary of polypeptide synthesis techniques may be found in J. Stuart and J. D. Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL, 3d Ed., Neurath, H. et al., Eds., p. 104-237, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976).
      <br/>
      Appropriate protective groups for use in such syntheses will be found in the above texts as well as in J. F. W. McOmie, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press, New York, N.Y. (1973).
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      Use of automated peptide synthesizers is also contemplated by the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, the within-described peptides may be synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 430A Automated Synthesizer following the manufacturer's instructions.
      <br/>
      Synthesized peptides may then be cleaved from the resin and deblocked using hydrofluoric acid following standard procedures as described.
      <br/>
      After neutralization to pH 7 (e.g., with sodium hydroxide), the peptides may be dialyzed into ammonium carbonate buffer and then lyophilized.
      <br/>
      Sequences may then be confirmed via peptide composition analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      In general, those synthetic methods comprise the sequential addition of one or more amino acid residues or suitably protected amino acid residues to a growing polypeptide chain.
      <br/>
      Normally, either the amino or carboxyl group of the first amino acid residue is protected by a suitable, selectively removable protecting group.
      <br/>
      A different, selectively removable protecting group is utilized for amino acids containing a reactive side group such as lysine.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Using a solid phase synthesis as an example, the protected or derivatized amino acid is attached to an inert solid support through its unprotected carboxyl or amino group.
      <br/>
      The protecting group of the amino or carboxyl group is then selectively removed and the next amino acid in the sequence having the complementary (amino or carboxyl) group suitably protected is admixed and reacted under conditions suitable for forming the amid linkage with the residue already attached to the solid support.
      <br/>
      The protecting group of the amino or carboxyl group is then removed from this newly added amino acid residue, and the next amino acid (suitably protected) is then added, and so forth.
      <br/>
      After all the desired amino acids have been linked in the proper sequence any remaining terminal and side group protecting groups (and solid support) are removed sequentially or concurrently, to provide the final polypeptide.
    </p>
    <p num="94">Another aspect of the present invention pertains to methods for producing subject polypeptides, analogs, or derivatives useful for inhibiting or preventing activation of NADPH oxidase and other enzyme systems involved in the oxidative burst of phagocytic cells which may be used in the diagnostic systems and methods of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="95">
      One such method entails initiating a culture comprising a nutrient medium containing host cells transformed with a recombinant DNA molecule of the present invention that is capable of expressing a gene encoding a subject peptide, such as a peptide corresponding or substantially homologous to a formula shown in Table 1 or 2.
      <br/>
      The culture is maintained for a time period sufficient for the transformed cells to express the subject polypeptide.
      <br/>
      The expressed polypeptide is then recovered from the culture. (While this method may be used to synthesize smaller polypeptides as described herein, it tends to be used more often for the expression of larger polypeptides and protein molecules.)
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      Methods for recovering an expressed polypeptide from a culture are well known in the art and include fractionation of the polypeptide-containing portion of the culture using well known biochemical techniques.
      <br/>
      For instance, the methods of gel filtration, gel chromatography, ultrafiltration, electrophoresis, ion exchange, affinity chromatography and the like, such as are known for protein fractionations, can be used to isolate the expressed proteins found in the culture.
      <br/>
      In addition, immunochemical methods, such as immunoaffinity, immunoabsorption and the like can be performed using well known methods.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      Peptides may also be synthesized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques.
      <br/>
      Using PCR, it is possible to synthesize useful polypeptide-encoding nucleotide sequences which may then be operatively linked to a vector and used to transform an appropriate cell and expressed therein.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Particularly preferred methods for producing large quantities of peptides and proteins such as those of the present invention rely on the use of preselected oligonucleotides as primers in a PCR to form PCR reaction products.
      <br/>
      If the DNA products are to be produced by (PCR) amplification, two primers, i.e., a PCR primer pair, must be used for each coding strand of nucleic acid to be amplified.
      <br/>
      The first primer becomes part of the nonsense (minus or complementary) strand and hybridizes to a nucleotide sequence conserved among the preferred gene's plus (or coding) strands.
      <br/>
      To produce coding DNA homologs, first primers are therefore chosen to hybridize to (i.e. be complementary to) conserved regions within the gene(s) of choice.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      Second primers become part of the coding (plus) strand and hybridize to a nucleotide sequence conserved among minus strands.
      <br/>
      To produce the coding DNA homologs, second primers are therefore chosen to hybridize with a conserved nucleotide sequence at the 5' end of the coding gene such as in that area coding for the leader or first framework region.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that in the amplification of the coding DNA homologs the conserved 5' nucleotide sequence of the second primer can be complementary to a sequence exogenously added using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase as described by Loh et al., Science 243: 217-220 (1989).
      <br/>
      One or both of the first and second primers can contain a nucleotide sequence defining an endonuclease recognition site (restriction site).
      <br/>
      The site can be heterologous to the gene being amplified and typically appears at or near the 5' end of the primer.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      When present, the restriction site-defining portion is typically located in a 5'-terminal non-priming portion of the primer.
      <br/>
      The restriction site defined by the first primer is typically chosen to be one recognized by a restriction enzyme that does not recognize the restriction site defined by the second primer, the objective being to produce a DNA molecule having cohesive termini that are non-complementary to each other and thus allow directional insertion into a vector.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      In PCR, each primer works in combination with a second primer to amplify a target nucleic acid sequence.
      <br/>
      The choice of PCR primer pairs for use in PCR is governed by various considerations, as is known in the art.
      <br/>
      That is, the primers have a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a sequence conserved in the gene of choice.
      <br/>
      The strategy used for cloning the selected genes will depend, as is well known in the art, on the type, complexity, and purity of the nucleic acids making up the various genes.
      <br/>
      Other factors include whether or not the genes are to be amplified and/or mutagenized.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      Useful components of a PCR reaction are readily available.
      <br/>
      For example, Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase I is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,889,818. Similarly, useful inducing agents are described in Chamberlin et al., The Enzymes, ed. P. Boyer, PP. 87-108, Academic Press, New York (1982) and Joyce, et al., Nuc. Acid Res. 17: 711-722 (1989), to name two examples.
      <br/>
      Amplification systems based on transcription have also been described by Gingeras et al., in PCR Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications, pp 245-252, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif. (1990).
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      If the inducing agent is a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and therefore incorporates ribonucleotide triphosphates, sufficient amounts of ATP, CTP, GTP and UTP are admixed to the primer extension reaction admixture and the resulting solution is treated as described above.
      <br/>
      The newly synthesized strand and its complementary nucleic acid strand form a double-stranded molecule which can be used in the succeeding steps of the process.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      After producing various polypeptide-encoding DNA homologs for one or a plurality of different genes or DNA segments, the DNA molecules are typically further amplified.
      <br/>
      PCR amplification methods are described in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,192, 4,683,202, 4,800,159, and 4,965,188, and at least in several texts including "PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification", H. Erlich, ed., Stockton Press, New York (1989); and "PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications", Innis et al., eds., Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990).
      <br/>
      Various preferred methods and primers are also described in Nilsson, et al., Cell 58: 707 (1989), Ennis, et al., PNAS USA 87: 2833-7 (1990), and Zemmour, et al., Immunogenetics 33: 310-20 (1991), for example.
      <br/>
      It is usually preferred to design primers from comparison of 5' and 3' untranslated regions of known allelic forms, with selection of conserved sequences.
      <br/>
      Restriction sites may also be incorporated into the 5' and 3' primers to enable the amplification products to be subcloned into sequencing or expression vectors.
      <br/>
      It may also be helpful to place a 4-base spacer sequence proximal to the restriction site to improve the efficiency of cutting amplification products with enzymes.

    <p num="106">
      Recombinant peptides or proteins may be prepared and purified essentially as follows. (Rac1 and Rac2 proteins are described herein as exemplary proteins.) Recombinant Rac2 was expressed in E. coli and purified according to the methods reported in Knaus, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 23575-23582 (1992).

      The full-length cDNA encoding Rac1 was subcloned into the BamHI site on the expression vector pET3a (Novagen, Madison, Wis.). E. coli strain BL21-DE3 (Novagen, Madison, Wis.) was used as the host cell for the recombinant plasmid identified as pER1, and was grown in LB medium at 37 (degree)  C. until an OD600 (optical density reading at 600 nm) of 0.7-0.9 was reached.

    <p num="111">E. Molecules Capable of Mimicking or Inhibiting GTP/GDP Regulatory Molecules</p>
    <p num="112">
      The present invention also contemplates the use of molecules capable of mimicking, inhibiting, or otherwise modifying the activity/effect of GTP/GDP regulatory molecules, thereby regulating the NADPH oxidase system of phagocytes.
      <br/>
      Examples of such useful molecules include mastoparan and mastoparan-like substances or peptides, which may be used to stimulate or inhibit GDP/GTP exchange on LMWG.
      <br/>
      Mastoparan and mastoparan analogs may also be used to stimulate GDP/GTP exchange on Rac and Rap polypeptides or proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      Mastoparan is a peptide of 14 amino acids in length which was originally derived from wasp venom.
      <br/>
      It has been suggested that it mimics a portion of the structure of receptors coupled to GTP binding proteins of the heterotrimene type (not LMWG) and thereby causes GDP/GTP exchange on these proteins.
      <br/>
      It is now shown that mastoparan and its analogs (including derivatives including or lacking an amino group at what is typically the carboxy-terminus of the polypeptide) also stimulate GDP/GTP exchange on the LMWG, including Rac and Rap1A.
      <br/>
      This effect may correlate with the ability of mastoparan to effectively inhibit NADPH oxidase activity in the cell-free system.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      Other molecules such as GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDI) may also be used according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, (Rho)GDI has now been reported to have a concentration-dependent effect on GTP hydrolysis by Rac1, parallelling its ability to inhibit GDP dissociation from the Rac protein (Chuang, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 775-778 (1993)).
      <br/>
      Other examples include Bcr, the product of the rearranged gene found in Philadelphia chromosome-positive CMLs and several chronic CLLs, which may act as a GTP-ase activating protein (GAP) for Rac, as may the related brain protein n-chimerin. (See, e.g., Chuang, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 775-778 (1993); and Diekmann, et al., Nature 351: 400-402 (1991).) Protein p190, which forms a complex with Ras-GAP subsequent to cell activation by growth factors or transforming tyrosine kinases, may also stimulate Rac GTP hydrolysis (Settleman, et al., Nature 359: 153-4 (1992)), as may a GAP originally isolated as a CDC42Hs GAP (Hart, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266: 20846-8 (1991); Chuang, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 775-778 (1993)).
      <br/>
      The relationships and similarities between Rac1, Rac2 and CDC42Hs, as well as the predicted amino acid sequences of these molecules, is discussed in Heyworth, et al., Mol. Biol. Cell 4: 261-9 (1993), incorporated herein by reference.

      Reaction mixtures (generally, in 96-well microtiter plates) typically contain 0.1 mM cytochrome c, 6.5 mM MgCl2, 87 mM KCl, 2.6 mM NaCl, 8.7 mM PIPES (pH 7.3), 10  MU M GTP GAMMA S, 0.16 mM NADPH, and 4 * 105 cell equivalents (cell eq) of neutrophil membranes (about 1.6  MU g protein), in a total volume of 150  MU l. In addition, reactions contain varying amounts of recombinant LMWG protein, and either (1) 8  MU l (7.2 * 105 cell eq.; about 18  MU g protein) of neutrophil cytosol, or (2) 10 nM each of baculovirus recombinant p47-phox and p67-phox as specified herein.
      <br/>
      Control wells (paired with each reaction well) contained 9  MU g SOD, to account for non-O2- -dependent reduction of cytochrome c. Superoxide production is initiated by the addition of SDS to give a final concentration of either 90  MU M (with recombinant p47-phox/p67-phox) or 110  MU M (with neutrophil cytosol).
      <br/>
      Maximum rates of absorbance change, calculated from the first derivative of the time course using Softmax software (Molecular Devices, release 2.01, Menlo Park, Calif.), were converted to nmol O2- generated/min/107 cell eq of membrane, after subtracting the rate achieved in the presence of SOD from that obtained in its absence, to give the rate of O2- -dependent cytochrome c reduction, by using an extinction coefficient of 20.5 mM-1 cm-1 for reduced minus oxidized cytochrome c, a value determined experimentally for the 550 +- 1-nm filter used in the kinetic microplate reader and the path length of the 250- MU l reaction mixture. (See, e.g., Curnutte, et al., PNAS USA 86: 825-829 (1989).

      The cDNAs encoding p190 protein have been cloned and the predicted protein product has been found to contain a region of homology with the breakpoint cluster region (Bcr) gene product associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). (See, e.g., Settleman, et al., Id. (1992); Groffen, et al., Cell 36: 93-99 (1984).) This region of Bcr exhibits GAP activity for the Rac1 protein (Diekmann, et al., Nature 351: 400-402 (1991)), and a number of proteins containing this domain have the ability to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family (Bokoch and Der, FASEB J. 7: 750-759 (1993); Hall, Cell 69: 389-391 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Indeed, p190 has been shown to have GAP activity for Rac1 and Rac2, as well as for RhoA and CDC42Hs. (See, e.g., Settleman, et al., Id. (1992).)

(The concentrations of SDS and arachidonic acid used in these studies are the concentrations of these anionic amphiphiles typically used in the cell-free NADPH oxidase assay.)

      The within-described studies also confirmed the presence of p190 in human phagocytic leukocytes.
      <br/>
      Human neutrophil membranes (30  MU g) or cytosol (50  MU g), and DMSO-differentiated HL60 cell lysates (2 * 105 cell eq) were immunoblotted with a 1:1000 dilution of a p190-specific antibody as described herein and in Settleman, et al., Cell 69: 539-549 (1992).

      <br/>
      The presence of p190 in human phagocytes could be seen after immunoblotting with a p190-specific antibody (Settleman, et al., Cell 69: 539-549 (1992); Settleman, et al., Nature 359: 153-154 (1992)). p190 was found to be primarily localized to the neutrophil cytosol, although a small amount could be detected in the purified plasma membrane function.
    </p>
    <p num="200">
      The ability of Rac to stimulate NADPH oxidase activity is dependent upon Rac being in the GTP-bound state. (See, e.g., Mizuno, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 10215-10218 (1992); Kwong, et al., Biochemistry 32: 5711-5717 (1993); Heyworth, et al., Mol. Biol. Cell 4: 261-269 (1993); Abo, et al., Nature 353: 668-670 (1991).) In order to investigate whether GAP proteins which are able to modulate the GTP/GDP state of Rac could regulate NADPH oxidase activity, the effect of adding p190 GAP to a cell-free NADPH oxidase assay was examined (see FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      The addition of recombinant p190 GAP to the system one minute before initiation of the reaction with SDS resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of O2- formation, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at about 100 nM p190 GAP.
      <br/>
      This correlates well with the amount of p190 GAP required for half-maximal stimulation of Rac GTPase activity in the presence of SDS (see FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      The inhibitory effect of p190 GAP in the cell-free system was substantially reversed by the addition of 10  MU M GTP GAMMA S (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      Since the free GTP concentration in the whole cytosol reaction is estimated to be 2.8  MU M (Peveri, et al., PNAS USA 89: 2494-2498 (1992)), it is likely that a portion of the endogenous Rac would still contain bound GTP even when 10  MU M GTP GAMMA S is added.
      <br/>
      By adding GTP GAMMA S to dialyzed cytosol in which endogenous GTP levels have been depleted, nearly all of the Rac present will have bound GTP GAMMA S. Under these conditions, NADPH oxidase activity was almost totally resistant to inhibition by p190 GAP (FIG. 3).
    </p>
    <p num="201">
      The ability of GTP GAMMA S to reverse the inhibition by p190 GAP of O2- formation suggests that this effect of p190 was due to its ability to stimulate GTP hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      When a second GAP (CDC42Hs GAP) active on Rac in the cell-free system was tested, inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity in a GTP GAMMA S-sensitive fashion was observed.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, there was an excellent correlation between the relative activity of these two GAPs for stimulating GTP hydrolysis by Rac in vitro and their ability to inhibit NADPH oxidase activity (data not shown).
      <br/>
      Thus, it was observed that it took approximately 10- to 20-fold more p190 GAP to stimulate a level of Rac GTP hydrolysis equal to that produced by a given amount of CDC42Hs GAP, and it also took 10- to 20-fold more p190 GAP to inhibit O2- formation in the cell-free assay.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      Rac2 and Rac1 have been shown to support NADPH oxidase activity, while the other members of the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins, Rho and CDC42Hs, are inactive in this system (Mizuno, et al., Id. (1992); Kwong, et al., Id. (1993); Heyworth, et al., Id. (1993)).
      <br/>
      Since p190 can stimulate GTP hydrolysis by all members of the Rho family, it was important to be certain that its inhibitory effect on the NADPH oxidase was the result of an action on Rac.
    </p>
    <p num="203">
      FIG. 8 shows that the addition to the cell-free assay of a Rac2 (Q61L) mutant protein which does not hydrolyze GTP and is unresponsive to p190 GAP activity (Xu, et al., Id. (1993)) to the cell-free assay was able to overcome totally the inhibitory effects of p190 GAP.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a GTP GAMMA S-loaded Rac1 protein also reversed the inhibitory activity of p190 GAP.
      <br/>
      In marked contrast, a GTP GAMMA S-bound form of RhoA did not reverse inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity by p190, even though this GTP-binding protein interacts even more strongly with p190 (Settleman, et al., Id. (1992)).
      <br/>
      Both Rac-GTP GAMMA S and Rac2-GTP (i.e., the Q61L mutant) caused an increase in the rate of O2- production over the control cytosol, suggesting that the level of endogenous Rac protein present was insufficient for maximal stimulation of the NADPH oxidase, perhaps due to the action of endogenous GAPs and other regulatory factors.
    </p>
    <p num="204">
      The experiments described above suggest that GAP proteins, and particularly p190 GAP, effectively inhibit NADPH oxidase through an effect on the levels of active Rac-GTP.
      <br/>
      The precise mechanisms through which Rac protein stimulates formation of O2- by the NADPH oxidase are still unknown, however.
      <br/>
      It is likely that formation of the active oxidase involves the assembly of a multiprotein complex consisting minimally of p47phox, p67phox, cytochrome b558, and probably involves Rac at the level of the plasma membrane.
      <br/>
      All of the three required cytosolic factors have been shown to translocate to the plasma membrane upon cell activation (Clark, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 85: 714-721 (1990); Heyworth, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 87: 352-356 (1991)), and membrane association of at least the p47phox and p67phox components is dependent upon cytochrome b558 (Heyworth, et al., Id. (1991); Kleinberg, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265: 15577-15583 (1990)).
      <br/>
      The nature and mechanism of action of this active complex have not yet been defined, however.
      <br/>
      The Rac protein would appear to be in the active, GTP-bound state at this stage, since Rac must be in a GTP-bound form for oxidase activation to occur (Mizuno, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 10215-10218 (1992); Kwong, et al., Biochemistry 32: 5711-5717 (1993); Heyworth, et al., Mol. Biol. Cell 4: 261-269 (1993)) and GTP binding to Rac may precede the translocation event (Phillips, et al., Science 259: 977-980 (1993); Bokoch, et al., FASEB J. 7: 750-759 (1993)).
    </p>
    <p num="205">
      The susceptibility of Rac to the action of p190 GAP in the active oxidase complex was examined by determining the ability of GAP to inhibit O2- formation in the cell-free assay once the reaction had been initiated with SDS.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 9, after the addition of stimulus to form active oxidase, p190 GAP was no longer able to inhibit O2- formation, even when added within 100 seconds of the addition of SDS and before the maximum rate of O2- generation was achieved.
      <br/>
      However, the NADPH oxidase could be inhibited at this stage by the addition of diphenylene iodonium, a potent NADPH oxidase inhibitor (Cross and Jones, Biochem. J. 237: 111-116 (1986)).
      <br/>
      This loss of the inhibitory effect of the Rac GAP when added after oxidase activation suggests either that the GAP no longer has access to Rac in the active, multiprotein complex formed, or that the action of Rac-GTP is no longer necessary once an active enzyme has been established.

    <p num="207">
      Evidence is provided herein that human neutrophil NADPH oxidase is susceptible to regulation by GAP proteins able to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Rac.
      <br/>
      Previous studies have suggested that the oxidase system can be modulated by other proteins known to interact with and regulate the nucleotide state of Rac, including smgGDS and �Rho�GDI. (See Knaus, et al., Id. (1992); Mizuno, et al., Id. (1992); Kwong, et al., Id. (1993); Abo, et al., Id. (1991).) Since GAPs act by stimulating the conversion of GTP to GDP, forming the inactive state of the low molecular weight GTP-binding (LMWG) protein substrate, these data indicate that the GTP-bound form of a small GTP-binding protein is essential for NADPH oxidase activation to occur.
      <br/>
      This is consistent with previous results which demonstrated that GTP was an absolute requirement of the NADPH oxidase (Uhlinger, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266: 20990-20997 (1991); Peveri, et al., PNAS USA 89: 2494-2498 (1992)).
      <br/>
      The within-disclosed results are also consistent with data from other cell-free studies which indicate that only the GTP-bound form of Rac is active in supporting NADPH oxidase activation. (See, e.g., Mizuno, et al., Id. (1992); Kwong, et al., Id. (1993); Heyworth, et al., Id. (1993); and Abo, et al., Id. (1991).)
    </p>
    <p num="208">
      The GAPs used in the presently-disclosed studies are p190 GAP and CDC42Hs GAP.
      <br/>
      It was previously suggested that p190 is active on members of the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins (Settleman, et al., Id. (1992)); it has now been found to be active on both Rac1 and Rac2 (see FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      Similarly, it has now been demonstrated that CDC42Hs GAP is nearly as active with Rac1 and Rac2 as with CDC42Hs (data not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="209">
      The inhibitory action of p190 on NADPH oxidase was almost certainly due to its ability to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Rac, as: (1) inhibition was prevented in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, GTP GAMMA S (see, e.g., FIG. 7); (2) the degree of inhibition caused by p190 GAP v. CDC42Hs GAP was directly correlated with their relative GAP activity toward Rac (data not shown); and (3) the inhibitory effect of p190 could be reversed by addition of GTP-bound forms of Rac1 and Rac2, but not by the GTP GAMMA S-bound form of RhoA (see, e.g., FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      These data confirm the critical role of Rac in regulating the human phagocyte NADPH oxidase.
    </p>
    <p num="210">
      p190 is a phosphoprotein that becomes tightly associated with p120 Ras GAP in mitogenically stimulated and tyrosine kinase-transformed cells (Ellis, et al., Nature 343: 377-381 (1990)). p190 may therefore provide a link between the Rho signalling pathway and signal transduction pathways regulated by Ras.
      <br/>
      It has now been shown via immunoblotting that p190 is present in mature human neutrophils and fully DMSO-differentiated HL60 cells.
      <br/>
      For example, human neutrophil membranes (30  MU g) or cytosol (50  MU g), and DMSO-differentiated HL60 cell lysates (2 * 105 cell eq) were immunoblotted with a 1:1000 dilution of a p190-specific antibody as described hereinabove.
      <br/>
      Results (not shown) confirmed that p190 is present in human phagocytic leukocytes.
      <br/>
      Whether p190 serves as a normal physiological regulator of the NADPH oxidase is not yet confirmed, and the presently-disclosed studies allow no definitive conclusions to be drawn in this regard at this time.
      <br/>
      However, the present studies do establish that p190 is present and indicate that it can regulate the activity of the NADPH oxidase.
    </p>
    <p num="211">
      The cell-free assay of O2- generation is conducted in the presence of 100  MU M SDS as an activating stimulus.
      <br/>
      The levels of p190 required to cause inhibition under these conditions are in the range of 100-400 nM, which correlated well with the concentrations of p190 required to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Rac in the presence of identical concentrations of SDS (compare FIGS. 3 and 7).
      <br/>
      Whether p190 is active in intact, stimulated neutrophils, and whether its activity might be regulated by phosphorylation in these cells, remains to be investigated.
      <br/>
      Rac GAP activity distinct from p190 has now been detected in human neutrophils (data not shown), and these proteins may also be important in determining NADPH oxidase activity, as well as in regulating other functions modulated by Rac, such as actin assembly (Ridley, et al., Cell 70: 401-410 (1992)).
      <br/>
      It will be important in future studies to begin to define the mechanisms by which individual Rac GAPs are regulated during phagocyte activation.
    </p>
    <p num="212">
      While Rac2 is required for NADPH oxidase activation and is known to translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane upon cell activation, the specific role(s) of Rac in regulating the system remain to be determined.
      <br/>
      Whether Rac participates as a component of the assembled NADPH oxidase along with p47phox, p67phox, and cytochrome b558 is not presently known.
      <br/>
      It has now been observed, however, that Rac was no longer responsive to p190 action once the NADPH oxidase was activated and assembled (see FIG. 9).
      <br/>
      This could indicate that p190 does not have access to the Rac protein when it is interacting with other oxidase components.
      <br/>
      Such a hypothesis would be consistent with what is known about Ras structure; in Ras, both GAP and downstream effectors (i.e., Raf kinase) bind to a shared "effector" domain made up of amino acid residues 32-40 (Moodie, et al., Science 260: 1658-1661 (1993); Vojtek, et al., Cell 74: 205-214 (1993)).
      <br/>
      Whether the equivalent domain in Rac is important for NADPH oxidase activation has not yet been established.
      <br/>
      If Rac in the active oxidase is indeed protected from GAP action, then this would suggest that Rac GAP(S) do not serve as the immediate signal for termination of the respiratory burst response.
    </p>
    <p num="213">
      Alternatively, the inability of p190 to inhibit NADPH oxidase once the system has been stimulated might indicate that the GTP-bound Rac is no longer required to maintain activity of the enzyme once activation has been initiated.
      <br/>
      While this possibility cannot be ruled out, the observation that Rac translocation is continuous during the time course of oxidase activation by chemoattractants and phorbol esters suggests that continuous activity of Rac is necessary to maintain an active enzyme.
      <br/>
      Based on current knowledge of GTP-binding protein action, this active Rac is likely to be the GTP-bound form.
    </p>
    <p num="214">
      Nevertheless, it has now been demonstrated that the human neutrophil NADPH oxidase is subject to negative regulation by proteins, such as p190, which can stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Rac.
      <br/>
      Thus, the NADPH oxidase appears subject to regulation by each of the three known classes of proteins able to modulate the GTP/GDP state of Ras-related GTP-binding proteins.
      <br/>
      It is of interest that the activity of certain GAPs may be modulated by the activation of cell surface hormone receptors (Marti and Lapetina, PNAS USA 89: 2784-2788 (1992); Liu, et al., Science 256: 1456-1458 (1992)), and the possibility that Rac GAP(s) in neutrophils is/are subject to chemoattractant-mediated regulation is a viable one.
      <br/>
      Rac-GTP appears not to be accessible to p190 after assembly of the active oxidase complex.
      <br/>
      Thus, the use of a GAP protein capable of modulating the activity of Rac in an intact system provides insight into the structure and function of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase system.
