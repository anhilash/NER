      A fuel cell is of a simple structure for preventing A partial temperature difference from being developed in a fuel cell structural body, and maintaining an effective operative area and performance.
      <br/>
      The fuel cell 10 includes a plurality of fuel cells 20 each sandwiched between separators 40, and has circulatory passages 29a, 29b defined therein for circulating cooling water, which has been used to cool the fuel cells 20, along opposite outer sides of electric generation sections 28 of the fuel cells 20.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a fuel cell having an electrolyte membrane sandwiched between an anode electrode and a cathode electrode.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">Solid polymer electrolyte fuel cells comprise a plurality of stacked fuel cell structural bodies (unit cells) each comprising an electrolyte membrane in the form of an ion exchange membrane and a catalytic electrode and a porous carbon electrode which are disposed one on each side of the electrolyte membrane, and a plurality of separators sandwiching the structural bodies.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Hydrogen supplied to the anode of the fuel cell is converted into hydrogen ions on the catalytic electrode, which move through the electrolyte membrane that has been humidified to an appropriate extent toward the cathode of the fuel cell.
      <br/>
      Electrons generated while the hydrogen ions are moving are transferred to an external circuit for use as direct-current electric energy.
      <br/>
      An oxygen containing gas such as an oxygen gas or air is supplied to the cathode electrode to generate water through a reaction between the hydrogen ions, the electrons, and the oxygen on the cathode electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="4">For such a fuel cell, there has been known a structure which, as shown in FIG. 11 of the accompanying drawings, comprises fuel cell structural bodies 2 and separators 4 which are alternately stacked together, each of the fuel cell structural bodies 2 having an electric generation section (electrode) 2a which is supplied with cooling water in a direction parallel to the flow of a fuel gas, e.g., a hydrogen gas and an oxygen containing gas, e.g., an oxygen gas.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Since the cooling water flows vertically in the electric generation section 2a, a relatively large temperature difference is developed between central and opposite side regions of the electric generation section 2a due to thermal diffusion.
      <br/>
      Because of a drop in the temperature, moisture is condensed in the opposite side regions of the electric generation section 2a, creating inoperative regions in the electric generation section 2a.
      <br/>
      In addition, the electric generation section 2a tends to have low-performance regions on account of the low temperature.
      <br/>
      As a result, the electric generation section 2a has its effective operative area and performance greatly lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="6">It is an object of the present invention to provide a fuel cell which will solve the above problems and has a simple structure for preventing partial temperature differences from being developed in fuel cell structural bodies thereby to maintain an effective operative area and performance.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      According to the present invention, a cooling medium, which has been used to cool an electric generation section of a fuel cell structural body, is then circulated along outer sides of the electric generation section.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the cooling medium whose temperature has been increased by a heat exchange in the electric generation section flows outside of the electric generation section.
      <br/>
      Consequently, any temperature difference between a central region of the electric generation section and outer edges thereof is minimized, thereby preventing moisture condensation and increasing an effective operative area and the performance of the electric generation section.

    <p num="26">Plural fuel cells 20 are sandwiched between separators 40, stacked such that their communication holes, other holes, and recesses are held in communication with each other, and fixed by the first and second end plates 84, 86.</p>
    <p num="27">When the fuel gas (hydrogen gas) is supplied from the through hole 86a in the second end plate 86 into the fuel cell 10, the fuel gas is supplied from the fuel gas supply hole 50a in the second manifold plate 50 into the fuel gas supply recess 42a in the first manifold plate 42, and then supplied through the grooves 80a in the fuel gas flow rectifying plate 80 disposed in the opening 45 held in communication with the fuel gas supply recess 42a, to the anode electrode 26 of the electric generation section 28.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The oxygen containing gas (air) is supplied from the through hole 84d in the first end plate 84 into the fuel cell 10, and flows through the oxygen containing gas supply hole 42c in the first manifold plate 42 and the oxygen containing gas supply hole 48c in the separator body 48 into the oxygen containing gas supply recess 50c in the second manifold plate 50.
      <br/>
      The oxygen containing gas passes from the oxygen containing gas supply recess 50c through the grooves 82a in the oxygen containing gas flow rectifying plate 82 to the cathode electrode 24.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The unused fuel gas is discharged through the fuel gas discharge recess 42d in the first manifold plate 42 out of the fuel cell 10 from the through hole 86c in the second end plate 86.
      <br/>
      The unused oxygen containing gas is discharged through the oxygen containing gas discharge recess 50f in the second manifold plate 50 out of the fuel cell 10 from the through hole 84e in the first end plate 84.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The cooling water is supplied from the through hole 86b in the second end plate 86 into the fuel cell 10, and flows through the cooling water supply hole 50e in the second manifold plate 50 into the cooling water supply recess 48e in the separator body 48.
      <br/>
      The cooling water then flows upwardly along the cooling water flow rectifying passages defined between the cooling water flow rectifying plate 70, 72 fixedly fitted in the opening 62 in the separator body 48, absorbs heat generated by the electric generation section 28, thereby cooling the electric generation section 28, and thereafter flows from the cooling water discharge recess 48b in the separator body 48 toward the first end plate 84.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The cooling water which has been used to remove the heat from the electric generation section 28 flows from the groove 84a in the first end plate 84 through the circulatory passages 29a, 29b, and is discharged out of the fuel cell 10 from the through holes 86d, 86e in the second end plate 86.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the cooling water introduced in the groove 84a in the first end plate 84 is supplied to the holes 43a, 43d in the first manifold plate 42 which serve as the circulatory passages 29a, 29b.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The cooling water supplied into the hole 43a in the first manifold plate 42 flows through the hole 49a in the separator body 48 and the hole 51a in the second manifold plate 50 into the groove 88a in the second end plate 86.
      <br/>
      The cooling water is then introduced through the hole 51b in the second manifold plate 50 which is held in communication with the groove 88a, the hole 49b in the separator body 48, and the hole 43b in the first manifold plate 42 into the groove 84b in the first end plate 84.
      <br/>
      Then the cooling water flows from the groove 84b through the hole 43c in the first manifold plate 42, the hole 49c in the separator body 48, and the hole 51c in the second manifold plate 50, and is discharged out of the fuel cell 10 from the through hole 86d in the second end plate 86.
    </p>
    <p num="33">The cooling water which has been supplied from the groove 84a in the first end plate 84 into the circulatory passage 29b flows through the hole 43d in the first manifold plate 42, the hole 49d in the separator body 48, and the hole 51d in the second manifold plate 50 into the groove 88b in the second end plate 86, and thereafter returns through the holes 51e, 49e, 43e into the groove 84c in the first end plate 84.</p>
    <p num="34">The cooling water is discharged through the holes 43f, 49f, 51f which are held in communication with the groove 84c out of the fuel cell 10 from the through hole 86e in the second end plate 86.</p>
    <p num="35">
      In this embodiment, as described above, the cooling water which has been supplied to the fuel cell 10 and removed the heat from the electric generation section 28 circulates along the circulatory passages 29a, 29b on the opposite sides of the electric generation section 28.
      <br/>
      Consequently, on the opposite sides of the electric generation section 28, the cooling water whose temperature has been increased by a heat exchange in the electric generation section 28 flows along the circulatory passages 29a, 29b for thereby preventing the electric generation section 28 in the vicinity of its opposite edges from being lowered in temperature (see FIG. 9).
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      As a consequence, any temperature difference between a central region of the electric generation section 28 and opposite edges thereof is minimized, thereby preventing moisture condensation on the opposite edges of the electric generation section 28 due to a temperature drop.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the electric generation section 28 is free of inoperative regions which would otherwise be caused by moisture condensation, and any low-performance regions of the electric generation section 28 due to low temperatures are reduced.
      <br/>
      Thus, the effective operative area and performance of the electric generation section 28 are effectively increased.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      According to this embodiment, furthermore, the fuel cell 10 is only required to have the circulatory passages 29a, 29b therein for circulating the cooling water which has absorbed heat through a heat exchange along the opposite outer sides of the electric generation section 28.
      <br/>
      The fuel cell 10 is not complicated in overall structure, and can easily and economically be constructed.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In the present embodiment, the circulatory passages 29a, 29b pass three times on the opposite sides of the electric generation section 28 (one and a half reciprocating cycle on each side).
      <br/>
      However, the fuel cell 10 may have circulatory passages 90a, 90b shown in FIG. 10. The circulatory passages 90a, 90b are provided by oblong holes 92a, 92b defined as vertically elongate holes in respective opposite sides of the second manifold plate 50.
      <br/>
      The first manifold plate 42, the second gasket 32, the solid polymer electrolyte membrane 22, the first gasket 30, the second surface pressure generating plate 46, the separator body 48, and the first surface pressure generating plate 44 also have vertically elongate oblong holes (not shown) defined in opposite sides thereof and held in communication with each other.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The circulatory passages 90a, 90b circulate cooling water, which has been used to remove heat from the electric generation section 28 and sent to the first end plate 84, through the vertically elongate oblong holes 92a, 92b, and then discharge the cooling water out of the fuel cell 10.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the circulatory passages 90a, 90b are capable of regulating the temperatures of the opposite sides of the electric generation section 28 together in the vertical direction, and also offer the same advantages as those of the circulatory passages 29a, 29b.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In the fuel cell according to the present invention, a cooling medium whose temperature is relatively high due to a heat exchange at an electric generation section is circulated along the outer sides of the electric generation section to prevent a partial temperature difference from being developed in the electric generation section.
      <br/>
      Therefore, moisture condensation is prevented, and the effective operative area and performance of the electric generation section are increased.
