    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to the fabrication of integrated circuit devices, and more particularly, to a method of forming planarized shallow trench isolation in the fabrication of integrated circuits.</p>
    <p num="3">(2) Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Shallow trench isolation (STI) is widely used to provide isolation between active areas, especially in ultra large scale integrated (ULSI) circuit devices.
      <br/>
      To achieve good planarity after STI, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is often used.
      <br/>
      However, due to pad deformation, the trench open area is susceptible to dishing which causes oxide thinning in the wide trench.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      FIG. 1 illustrates a partially completed integrated circuit device of the prior art.
      <br/>
      A silicon nitride layer 14 has been deposited over the surface of a semiconductor substrate 10.
      <br/>
      Trenches in the substrate have been filled with an oxide 17.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 2, the oxide 17 is polished using CMP.
      <br/>
      Oxide dishing and the resulting lack of oxide uniformity can both be seen in area 19.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A number of workers in the art have sought to avoid these problems. U.S. Pat. No. 4,962,064 to Haskell et al teaches the use of a polysilicon layer over the oxide trench fill material.
      <br/>
      The oxide material is then planarized with a series of alternating CMP and dry or wet etches including at least two of each. U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,857 to Cooperman et al teaches CMP of shallow trenches using a reverse-tone mask to form oxide blocks in the wide trenches and a silicon nitride polish stop layer. U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,704 to Paoli et al discloses filling trenches with a first conformal oxide, a planarizing oxide, and then a second conformal oxide.
      <br/>
      The fill material is planarized by chemical etching the active areas through a mask, then CMP, followed by chemical etching with an etch stop at the silicon nitride layer. U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,858 to Bose et al shows a silicon nitride liner deposited in the trench before the oxide filler.
      <br/>
      The oxide is then steam annealed, followed by a resist etchback step and CMP. U.S. Pat. No. 5,663,107 to Peschke et al uses a doped glass as a fill material with silicon nitride thereover.
      <br/>
      Planarization includes CMP, isotropic etch back, dry etching to remove the nitride, and a second CMP step.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="13">
      Referring now more particularly to FIG. 3, there is shown a semiconductor substrate 10.
      <br/>
      A layer of pad silicon oxide 12 is grown on the surface of the semiconductor substrate to a thickness of between about 50 and 250 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      A layer of silicon nitride 14 is deposited over the pad oxide layer 12 to a thickness of between about 500 and 2500 Angstroms.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Referring now to FIG. 4, shallow trenches are etched into the silicon substrate using conventional photolithography and etching techniques.
      <br/>
      The shallow trenches 16 are etched to a depth of between about 2500 and 5000 Angstroms into the semiconductor substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Next, as illustrated in FIG. 5, a silicon oxide layer 20 is deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to a thickness of between about 5000 and 16,000 Angstroms over the surface of the substrate and filling the trenches.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Now, the key features of the present invention will be described.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 6, a capping silicon nitride layer 22 is deposited conformally over the oxide layer 20 to a thickness of between about 400 and 2000 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      This layer 22 may be some other material than silicon nitride as long as it can be polished and etched selectively with respect to the silicon oxide layer 20.
      <br/>
      For example, silicon nitride layer 22 is deposited by CVD or plasma-enhanced CVD.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Referring now to FIG. 7, a second silicon oxide layer 26 is deposited by CVD or plasma-enhanced CVD over the capping nitride layer 22 to a thickness of between about 1000 and 5000 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      The second oxide layer is preferably of the same material as the first oxide layer 20, but may be of a different material.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The second oxide layer is now polished using CMP and stopping when the second nitride layer 22 is polished away in the areas over the narrow spaces, as illustrated in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The CMP step uses time mode control to assure that the second nitride layer 22 remains only within the trench.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Next, a dry oxide etching is performed with an etch stop at silicon nitride with overetching.
      <br/>
      This removes all of the second oxide 26 and the first oxide 20 above the top of the first nitride layer 14, as shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      When the nitride layer 22 is reached, it is overetched by between about 10 and 20% so that all of the oxide 26 overlying the nitride layer 26 is removed.
      <br/>
      This overetching using an endpoint detector allows the remaining oxide thickness to be controlled easily.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Because of the presence of the second nitride layer 22 over the wide trench, dishing over the wide trench is eliminated.
      <br/>
      The silicon nitride is removed with a conventional wet etch and the pad oxide is removed completing the formation of the shallow trench isolation, as illustrated in FIG. 10.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Processing continues as is conventional in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, semiconductor device structures, including gate electrodes 32 and source and drain regions 34 may be formed as is conventional in the art.
      <br/>
      Electrical contacts 38 may be made through dielectric isolation layer 36, as shown in FIG. 11.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The process of the present invention results in the formation of planarized shallow trench isolation using a CMP process followed by a dry etching wherein oxide dishing is eliminated.
      <br/>
      The dry etching, using overetching with endpoint detector, allows the remaining oxide thickness to be controlled easily.
    </p>
    <p num="23">While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
