      An organic photoreceptor ("OPR") including a barrier layer formed from a barrier layer coating composition including a cellulosic resin, methylvinyl ether/maleic anhydride copolymer, a polyamide, a crosslinker, and a combination thereof, provides sufficient protection to the organic photoreceptor from damage due to corona-induced charge injection; is substantially inert with respect to the organic photoconductive layer; exhibits sufficient resiliency to withstand shear, compressional and tensional forces exerted on the belt as it passes through an electrophotographic system when the photoreceptor is used in an endless belt form; and provides sufficient protection to limit or prevent a liquid toner from contacting the organic photoconductor that may result in crazing and/or cracking of the organic photoreceptor during use.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to organic photoreceptors suitable for use in electrophotography and, in particular, in liquid electrophotography.</p>
    <p num="2">
      In electrophotography, a photoreceptor in the form of a plate, belt, or drum having an electrically insulating photoconductive element on an electrically conductive substrate is imaged by first uniformly electrostatically charging the surface of the photoconductive layer, and then exposing the charged surface to a pattern of light.
      <br/>
      The light exposure selectively dissipates the charge in the illuminated areas, thereby forming a pattern of charged and uncharged areas.
      <br/>
      A liquid or solid toner is then deposited in either the charged or uncharged areas to create a toned image on the surface of the photoconductive layer.
      <br/>
      The resulting visible toner image can be transferred to a suitable receiving surface such as paper.
      <br/>
      The imaging process can be repeated many times.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Both single layer and multilayer photoconductive elements have been used.
      <br/>
      In the single layer embodiment, a charge transport material and charge generating material are combined with a polymeric binder and then deposited on the electrically conductive substrate.
      <br/>
      In the multilayer embodiment, the charge transport material and charge generating material are in the form of separate layers, each of which can optionally be combined with a polymeric binder, deposited on the electrically conductive substrate.
      <br/>
      Two arrangements are possible.
      <br/>
      In one arrangement (the "dual layer" arrangement), the charge generating layer is deposited on the electrically conductive substrate and the charge transport layer is deposited on top of the charge generating layer.
      <br/>
      In an alternate arrangement (the "inverted dual layer" arrangement), the order of the charge transport layer and charge generating layer is reversed.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In both the single and multilayer photoconductive elements, the purpose of the charge generating material is to generate charge carriers (i.e., electron-hole pairs) upon exposure to light.
      <br/>
      The purpose of the charge transport material is to accept one of these charge carriers and transport them through the charge transport layer in order to discharge a surface charge on the photoconductive element.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      To produce high quality images, particularly after multiple cycles, it is desirable for the charge transport material to form a homogeneous solution with the polymeric binder and remain in solution.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is desirable to maximize the amount of charge which the charge transport material can accept (indicated by a parameter known as the acceptance voltage or "Vacc "), and to minimize retention of that charge upon discharge (indicated by a parameter known as the residual voltage or "Vres ").
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Liquid toners generally produce superior images compared to dry toners.
      <br/>
      However, liquid toners also can facilitate stress crazing in the photoconductive element.
      <br/>
      Stress crazing, in turn, leads to printing defects such as increased background.
      <br/>
      It also degrades the photoreceptor, thereby shortening its useful lifetime.
      <br/>
      The problem is particularly acute when the photoreceptor is in the form of a flexible belt included in a compact imaging machine that employs small diameter support rollers (e.g., having diameters no greater than about 40 mm) confined within a small space.
      <br/>
      Such an arrangement places significant mechanical stress on the photoreceptor, and can lead to degradation and low quality images.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      One solution developed has been to provide a barrier layer to an organic photoreceptor.
      <br/>
      Conventional barrier layers have been formed from a variety of materials, examples of which include crosslinkable siloxanol-colloidal silica hybrids (as disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,439,509; 4,606,934; 4,595,602; and 4,923,775); a coating formed from a dispersion of hydroxylated silsesquioxane and colloidal silica in an alcohol medium (as disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 4,565,760); a polymer resulting from a mixture of polyvinyl alcohol with methyl vinyl ether/maleic anhydride copolymer (e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,124,220); a coating formed from an organic polymer (such as polyacrylates, polyurethanes, polyvinyl acetals, sulfonated polyesters, and mixtures of polyvinyl alcohol with methylvinylether/maleic anhydride copolymer) and silica (e.g., in International Publication No. WO 95/02853); and polyvinyl butyral crosslinked with methylvinylether/maleic anhydride copolymer, such as that commercially available under the trade designation GANTREZ AN 169, from ISP, Wayne, N.J.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      However, it has been found that these barrier layers do not provide an organic photoconductive layer with adequate protection from liquid contact when a liquid toner is utilized.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it has been found that these barrier layers do not possess sufficient resiliency to be used in belt form, as evidenced by stress fractures that developed in the charge transport layers when subjected to stress testing in the presence of a liquid toner.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      Thus, what is yet needed is an organic photoreceptor including a barrier layer that possesses improved resistance to liquid toners while maintaining other suitable electrophotographic properties, such as stability under charge-discharge cycling.
      <br/>
      It is also highly desirable that such a barrier layer possesses sufficient resiliency so that the organic photoreceptor is useful in belt form.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention provides an organic photoreceptor that includes an organic photoconductor having a first major surface and a second major surface; a barrier layer on the first major surface of the photoconductor formed from a barrier layer coating composition comprising a cellulosic resin, a methylvinylether/maleic anhydride copolymer, and a crosslinking agent.

    </p>
    <p num="12">The electrophotographic system, as described above, may further include a second image-wise exposing device for exposing the photoreceptor with radiation modulated in accordance with the image data for a second of the plurality of colors in order to partially discharge the photoreceptor to produce an image-wise distribution of charges on the photoreceptor corresponding to the image data for the second of the plurality of colors in registration with the first color image, wherein the second image-wise exposing device produces the image-wise distribution of charges without erasing the photoreceptor subsequent to the first image-wise exposing of the photoreceptor; and a second applicator to apply a second color liquid toner to the image-wise distribution of charges on the photoreceptor to form a second color image in registration with the first color image.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="27">
      The present invention provides an organic photoreceptor 10 that preferably includes, as shown in FIG. 1a, a conductive substrate 102, a photoconductive element 104, a barrier layer 106, and a release layer 108.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the photoconductive element 104 is a bilayer construction featuring a charge generating layer 110 and a separate charge transport layer 112.
      <br/>
      The charge generating layer 110 may be located intermediate the conductive substrate 102 and the charge transport layer 112, as shown in FIG. 1a.

      Referring to FIG. 1b, another embodiment in accordance with the present invention is shown, wherein an organic photoreceptor 10' includes a conductive substrate 102, a photoconductive element 104, a barrier layer 106, a tie layer 107, and a release layer 108.
      <br/>
      Consistent with a photoreceptor construction in accordance with the present invention, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other layers (e.g., a charge injection barrier layer) can be present in the photoreceptor.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Photoconductive Element</p>
    <p num="30">
      As mentioned above, a photoconductive element preferably includes a charge generating layer and a charge transport layer.
      <br/>
      Generally, the charge generating layer includes a charge generating compound dispersed within a binder.
      <br/>
      The charge generating compound is a material that is capable of absorbing light to generate charge carriers.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable compounds are well known and include dyestuffs and pigments (such as metal-free phthalocyanine pigments from Zeneca, Inc., and Y-form metal-free phthalocyanine pigments).
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Charge transport compounds suitable for use in the charge transport layer of the photoconductors of the present invention should be capable of supporting the injection of photo-generated holes or electrons from the charge generation layer (depending upon the charging polarity) and allowing the transport of these holes or electrons through the charge transport layer to selectively discharge the surface charge.
      <br/>
      Preferable hole transport compounds comprise aromatic amines, hydrazone compounds, oxadiazole compounds, oxazole compounds, pyrazoline compounds, triphenyldiamine compounds, and triarylmethane compounds.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred transport materials are described in U.S. patent application Ser.

    <p num="32">
      The charge transport compound may act as a binder.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to combine the charge transport compound and/or the charge generating compound with a separate polymeric binder.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable binders include styrenebutadiene copolymers, modified acrylic polymers, vinyl acetate polymers, styrene-alkyd resins, soya-alkyl resins, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinylchloride, polyvinylidene chloride, acrylonitrile, polycarbonate, polyacrylic and methacrylic esters, polystyrene, polyesters, and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable polycarbonate binders include aryl polycarbonates, such as aryl polycarbonates including poly(4,4-dihydroxy-diphenyl-1,I-cyclohexane) ("Polycarbonate Z 200; Z 300; Z 400; Z 800," all available from Mitsubishi Engineering Plastics, White Plains, N.Y.) and poly(Bisphenol A carbonate)-co-4,4'(3,3,5-trimethyl cyclohexylidene) diphenol.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A particularly useful binder is polyvinyl butyral.
      <br/>
      This material has free hydroxyl groups available for reaction, e.g., with isocyanate groups which may be present in the charge transport layer, the charge generating layer, additional layers, or a combination thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Barrier Layer</p>
    <p num="35">
      Although barrier layers included in photoreceptors are well known, they do not possess or are inadequate in one or more of the following performance characteristics: (a) providing sufficient protection to the organic photoreceptor from damage due to corona-induced charge injection; (b) substantially inert with respect to the organic photoconductive layer; (c) exhibiting sufficient resiliency to withstand shear, compressional and tensional forces exerted on the belt as it passes through the system (described below) when the photoreceptor is used in an endless belt form; and (d) providing sufficient protection to limit or prevent a liquid toner from contacting the organic photoconductor.
      <br/>
      For example, conventional barrier layers are typically formed from materials such as crosslinkable siloxanol-colloidal silica, a dispersion of hydroxylated silsesquioxane and colloidal silica in an alcohol medium, a polymer resulting from a mixture of polyvinyl alcohol with methyl vinyl ether/maleic anhydride copolymer, an organic polymer (e.g., polyacrylates, polyurethanes, polyvinyl acetals, sulfonated polyesters, mixtures of polyvinyl alcohol with methylvinylether/maleic anhydride copolymer and silica, and methyl cellulose) and polyvinyl butyral crosslinked with methylvinylether/maleic anhydride copolymer.
      <br/>
      However, many of these barrier layers may not possess the necessary resistance to the paraffinic solvents used in liquid toners (solvents such as NORPAR and ISOPAR from Exxon, USA) to protect the organic photoreceptor from the solvent in the liquid toner while maintaining suitable electrostatic and print quality properties.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In accordance with the present invention, an organic photoreceptor includes a barrier layer formed from a barrier layer coating composition including a cellulose resin, a methylvinyl ether/maleic anhydride copolymer, and a crosslinking agent.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the cellulose resin is selected from the group consisting of a modified cellulose, an unmodified cellulose, and a combination thereof.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the cellulose resin is selected from the group of methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, a cellulose ester, and a combination thereof.
      <br/>
      Suitable cellulose resins are commercially available, such as methyl cellulose and ethyl cellulose available from Aldrich Chemical, Milwaukee, WI; and hydyroxypropyl cellulose, available under the trade designation KLUCEL, froin Hercules Chemical, Wilmington, Del.
    </p>
    <p num="37">As mentioned above, a barrier layer coating composition also includes a methylvinyl ether/maleic anhydride copolymer, such as that commercially available under the trade designation of GANTREZ AN series, from ISP Chemical, Wayne, N.J.</p>
    <p num="38">
      As mentioned above, a barrier layer coating composition in accordance with the present invention preferably includes a crosslinking agent.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the crosslinking agent is selected from the group of a bis aldehyde, an organosilane, a melamine resin, and a combination thereof.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the bis aldehyde is an aliphatic dialdehyde and, even more preferably, the cross-linking agent is glyoxal, such as that commercially available under the trade designation GLYOXAL 40, from Aldrich Chemical, Milwaukee, Wis.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the organosilane is one that contains one or more functional groups.
      <br/>
      For example, one suitable organosilane containing functional groups is an acetoxy-epoxy functional silsequioxane, such as that commercially available under the trade designation SYL-OFF 297, from Dow Corning Corporation.
    </p>
    <p num="39">A barrier layer coating composition preferably includes a suitable amount of resin and copolymer in order to enhance protection of the organic photoconductor from the solvent typically included in the toner (as indicated by the reduction of cracks or crazing in an organic photoreceptor after testing as described herein) while simultaneously providing sufficient protection to the organic photoreceptor from damage due to corona-induced charge injection (as indicated by the voltage from the laser charge up and discharge tests described herein).</p>
    <p num="40">Accordingly, in one preferred embodiment, the barrier layer coating composition comprises a ratio of the resin to the copolymer of about 0.4:1.0 to about 1.0:0.4 and, more preferably, the ratio of the resin to the copolymer is about 1:1.</p>

    <p num="70">Electrophotographic System</p>
    <p num="71">
      Organic photoreceptors described above are suitable for use in an imaging process with either dry or liquid toner development.
      <br/>
      Liquid toner development is generally preferred because it offers the advantages of providing higher resolution images and requiring lower energy for image fixing compared to dry toners.
      <br/>
      Examples of useful liquid toners are well known.
      <br/>
      They typically include a colorant (preferably a pigment), a resin binder, a charge director, and a carrier liquid.

    <p num="72">
      Organic photoreceptors according to the invention are particularly useful in a compact electrophotographic imaging system where an organic photoreceptor in accordance with the present invention is wound around and supported by several rollers.
      <br/>
      A number of apparatus designs may be employed, including for example, the apparatus designs disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,650,253 (Baker et al.); 5,659,851 (Moe et al.); and 5,916,718 (Kellie et al.).
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of one preferred embodiment of an electrophotographic system 42 and a method for producing a multi-colored image utilizing an organic photoreceptor described above.
      <br/>
      An organic photoreceptor 10, preferably in the form of an endless belt, is mechanically supported by belt 44 that rotates, preferably in a clockwise direction, around rollers 46 and 48.
      <br/>
      The organic photoreceptor 10 may be first conventionally erased with an erase lamp 14.
      <br/>
      Preferably, any residual charge left on the organic photoreceptor 10 after the preceding cycle is removed by the erase lamp 14 and then conventionally charged using charging device 18 (e.g., a corona charging device), such procedures being well known in the art.
      <br/>
      When charged, a surface of the organic photoreceptor 10 is preferably charged from about 550 volts to about 750 volts.
      <br/>
      A laser scanning device 50 exposes the charged surface of the organic photoreceptor 10 to radiation in an image-wise pattern corresponding to a first color plane of the image to be reproduced.
      <br/>
      Suitable laser scanning devices are well known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Thereafter, charged pigment particles in a liquid toner 54, corresponding to the first color plane, will migrate to and plate upon the charged surface of the organic photoreceptor 10 in areas where the surface voltage of the organic photoreceptor 10 is less than the bias of electrode 56 associated with a liquid toner developer station 52.
      <br/>
      Charge neutrality of the liquid toner 54 is maintained by negatively charged counter ions that balance the positively charged pigment particles.
      <br/>
      The counter ions are deposited on the surface of the organic photoreceptor 10 in areas where the surface voltage is greater than the bias voltage of the electrode 56, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,596,398 (Woo et al.), associated with the liquid toner developer station 52.
      <br/>
      One example of a suitable developer station is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,300,990 (Thompson et al.).
      <br/>
      Another developer apparatus is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,758,236 (Teschendorf et al.).
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      At this stage, the organic photoreceptor 10 includes, on its surface, an image-wise distribution of plated "solids" of liquid toner 54 in accordance with the first color plane.
      <br/>
      The surface charge distribution of the organic photoreceptor 10 has also been recharged with plated ink particles as well as with transparent counter ions from the liquid toner 54, both being governed by the image-wise discharge of the organic photoreceptor 10 due to laser scanning device 50.
      <br/>
      Thus, the surface charge of the organic photoreceptor 10 is quite uniform.
      <br/>
      Although not all of the original surface charge of the organic photoreceptor may have been obtained, a substantial portion of the previous surface charge of the organic photoreceptor has been recaptured.
      <br/>
      With such solution recharging, the organic photoreceptor 10 can be processed for the next color plane of the image to be reproduced.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Although not required, a "topping corona" (not illustrated) may be applied to photoreceptor 10 following the first three or, optionally, all development stations 52, 60, 68 and 76, respectively.
      <br/>
      For example, while photoreceptor 10 recharges following development with liquid inks 54, 62 and 70, it typically does not recharge completely to the previously charged voltage.
      <br/>
      Thus, a conventional corona charging device may be employed following development stations 52, 60 and 68 to bring the voltage on photoreceptor 10 back to a preferred charging level.
      <br/>
      For example, following erasure by erase lamp 14, the surface of photoreceptor 10 is art a relatively low voltage level, typically around 100 volts.
      <br/>
      Following charging by a corona charging device (not shown), the surface of photoreceptor 10 is charged to a relatively high value suitable to development of a liquid ink, typically around 700 volts.
      <br/>
      Following image-wise exposure to radiation by laser scanning device 50, corresponding to a first color plane (preferably yellow), the areas of the surface of photoreceptor 10 are discharged to a discharged level of around 150 volts.
      <br/>
      Non-exposed areas of the surface of photoreceptor 10 remain at a highly charged level, around 700 volts.
      <br/>
      Following development by developer station 52, the surface of photoreceptor 10 is substantially uniformly charged to an intermediate level of around 500 volts.
      <br/>
      Discharged areas of photoreceptor 10 are developed "up" to 500 volts and non-discharged areas of photoreceptor 10 are developed "down" to 500 volts.
      <br/>
      Because this developed voltage will tend to decay over time, a topping corona is preferably used to bring the surface of photoreceptor 10 back up to the high level of around 700 volts.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      As the belt 44 continues to rotate, the organic photoreceptor 10 next is image-wise exposed to radiation from laser scanning device 58 corresponding to a second color plane.
      <br/>
      Significantly, this process occurs during a single revolution of the organic photoreceptor by the belt 44 and without erasing the organic photoreceptor 10 subsequent to exposure to the laser scanning device 58 and the second liquid toner development station 60 corresponding to the first color plane.
      <br/>
      The remaining charge on the surface of the organic photoreceptor 10 is subjected to radiation corresponding to a second color plane.
      <br/>
      This produces an image-wise distribution of the surface charge on the organic photoreceptor 10 corresponding to the second color plane of the image.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      The second color plane of the image is then developed by a developer station 60 containing a liquid toner 62.
      <br/>
      The liquid toner 62 preferably contains "solid" color pigments consistent with the second color plane and substantially transparent counter ions that, although they may have differing chemical compositions than the substantially transparent counter ions of the liquid toner 54, they are still substantially transparent and oppositely charged to the "solid" color pigments.
      <br/>
      The electrode 64 provides a bias voltage to allow "solid" color pigments of the liquid toner 62 to create a pattern of "solid" color pigments on the surface of the organic photoreceptor 10 corresponding to the second color plane.
      <br/>
      The transparent counter ions also substantially recharge the organic photoreceptor 10 and make the surface of the organic photoreceptor 10 substantially uniform so that another color plane may be placed upon the organic photoreceptor 10 without erasing or corona discharging.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      A third color plane of the image to be reproduced is deposited on the surface of the photoreceptor 10 in a similar fashion using a laser scanning device 66 and a developer station 68 containing a liquid toner 70 using an electrode 72.
      <br/>
      Again, the surface voltage of the photoreceptor 10 may be somewhat less than existed prior to exposure to the laser scanning device 66 but will be substantially "recharged" and will be quite uniform allowing application of the fourth color plane without erasing or corona charging.
    </p>
    <p num="80">Similarly, a fourth color plane is deposited upon the photoreceptor 10 using a laser scanning device 74 and a developer station 76 containing a liquid toner 78 using an electrode 80.</p>
    <p num="81">
      Preferably, excess toner from the liquid toners 54, 62, 70, and 78 is "squeezed" off using a roller that may be used in conjunction with one or more of the developer stations 52, 60, 68, and 76, (shown as rollers 82, 84, 86, and 88, respectively, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,754,928 (Moe et al.)) to form plated solids from each of the liquid toners.
      <br/>
      The plated solids on the photoreceptor are then dried using a drying mechanism 34 to form a completed dry four color image.
      <br/>
      The drying mechanism 34 may utilize air blowers or may be other active devices such as drying rollers, vacuum devices, coronas, etc.
      <br/>
      One suitable drying mechanism is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,420,675 (Thompson et al.).
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      The dry four color image is then preferably transferred, either directly to a medium 36 to be printed, or more preferably, indirectly by way of transfer mechanism 39, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Typically, heat and/or pressure are used to fix the image to the medium 36.
      <br/>
      Although the transfer mechanism 39 can take a variety of forms, one suitable transfer mechanism includes transfer rollers 38 and 40 and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,650,253 (Baker et al.).
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      With proper selection of charging voltages and liquid toners, the process may be repeated an indeterminate number of times to produce a multi-colored image having an indeterminate number of color planes.
      <br/>
      Although the process and apparatus has been described in connection with four color images, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention is suitable for multi-color images hating two or more color planes.

    <p num="95">
      An inverted dual layer organic photoconductor (herein, "OPC") was prepared utilizing compound (2) as described in U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/172,379, filed Oct. 14, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,426, entitled "Organophotoreceptors for Electrophotography Featuring Novel Charge Transport Compounds" (Mott et al.) was used as the substrate, that included a polyester layer, an aluminum layer, a PET layer (formed from a resin commercially available under the trade designation VITEL PE 2200, from Bostik Chemicals, Middleton, Mass., at a 4.4% solids in a 2:1 MEK:toluene mixture, coated at a thickness of 0.2 micrometers using a slot die coater with a web speed of 3.048 meters/min., dried in 4 oven zones of 110 (degree)  C., 120 (degree)  C., 140 (degree)  C., and 150 (degree)  C.), a charge transport layer, and a charge generating layer.
      <br/>
      A barrier layer coating composition was then coated over the charge generating layer at a thickness ranging from 0.2-0.8 micrometers.
      <br/>
      The web was run at 10 feet (3.048 m) per minute, through 20 feet (6.096 m) of oven.
      <br/>
      The barrier layer coating compositions described above were applied using a conventional slot die coater.

      The coated OPC was passed through 4 oven zones set at 90 (degree)  C., 100 (degree)  C., 110 (degree)  C., and 120 (degree)  C. to dry the barrier layer coating composition, forming the barrier layer.

      Dynamic Carrier Liquid Crazing Resistance:
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      A 7.62 cm * 22.86 cm sample of each OPR Example/Comparative Example was mounted on a flexure fatigue tester that applies 50 lbs (24.7 kg) tensile load on the sample.
      <br/>
      A sufficient amount of a paraffinic hydrocarbon solvent commercially available under the trade designation NORPAR 12, from Exxon Corp., Houston Tex., was then spread onto the surface, and six rollers of 2.54 cm diameter continuously deflect the sample from the back side.
      <br/>
      After 4 hours (which is believed to be equivalent to 10,000 cycles in a belt printing mechanism), the sample is released and visibly examined for any sign of crazing.
    </p>
    <p num="100">2. Static Solvent Crazing Resistance:</p>
    <p num="101">
      A cylindrical sample (30.cm long * 30 cm circumference) of each OPR Example/Comparative Example was mounted on a staltic load tester, which employs a 1.27 cm and 1.91 cm diameter metal bar on either end of the frame to stretch the sample with 36 lbs (16.33 kg) of force.
      <br/>
      A sufficient amount of the NORPAR solvent was spread on the coated surface.
      <br/>
      After 10 minutes, the sample was released, allowed to dry, and visibly examined for signs of crazing according to the subjective standard: a rating of 1 indicated no crazing present, 1.5 indicated very, very light crazing was present, 2 indicated very light crazing, and so on to an upper score of 8 that indicated very heavy crazing.
      <br/>
      A value more than about 3 was considered an unacceptable to be useful in an electrophotographic process.

      Two 30.48 cm * 30.48 cm samples of each OPR Example/Comparative Example were cut.
      <br/>
      A piece of book tape was then stuck onto one sample and rubbed with the thumb.
      <br/>
      The tape is then pulled back sharply at about 180 degrees.
      <br/>
      The surface was then visually examined for delamination.

    <p num="104">
      The second sample cut from each Example/Comparative Example was soaked in the carrier liquid overnight at room temperature, dried, and then a piece of book tape was then stuck onto one sample and rubbed with the thumb.
      <br/>
      The tape is then pulled back sharply at about 180 degrees.
      <br/>
      The surface was again visually examined for delamination.
    </p>
    <p num="105">4. Dry Electrostatic Performance:</p>
    <p num="106">
      Three belts, each measuring 50 cm long by 8.8 cm wide, were fastened side-by-side and completely around an aluminum drum (50 cm circumference).
      <br/>
      The drum rotated at a rate of 7.6 cm/min and the erase, corona charging, laser discharge, stations are located at 20 (degree) , 35 (degree) , and 45 (degree)  positions, respectively, from the top of the drum.
      <br/>
      The first electrostatic probe (Trek 344 electrostatic meter, from Trek Inc., Medina N.Y.) is located immediately after the laser discharge stations and the second probe at 180 (degree)  from the top of the drum.
      <br/>
      These measurements were performed at room temperature (25 (degree)  C.).
    </p>
    <p num="107">Electrostatic measurements were obtained from the following sequence of test subroutines:</p>
    <p num="108">
      1) PRODSTART: This test was designed to evaluate the electrostatic cycling of a new, fresh belt.
      <br/>
      The belt was completely charged for three cycles (drum rotations); discharged with the laser at 780 nm, 600 dpi on the forth cycle; completely charged for the next three cycles; discharged with only the erase lamp at 720 nm on the eighth cycle; and, finally, completely charged for the last three cycles.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      2) VLOGE: This test measured the response of the photoconductor to various irradiation levels (0.01 mW to 3 mW) by monitoring the discharge voltage of the bell; as a function of the laser power.
      <br/>
      A semi-logarithmic plot was generated (voltage verses log E) when the belt is charged and then discharged using the laser at different power levels.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      3) DARK DECAY: This test measured the loss of charge acceptance with time without laser or erase illumination and can be used as an indicator of i) the injection of residual holes from the charge generation layer to the charge transport layer, ii) the thermal liberation of trapped charges, and iii) the injection of charge from the surface or aluminum ground plane.
      <br/>
      After the belt was completely charged, it was stopped under the probe near the laser discharge station, and the surface voltage level was measured over a period of 90 seconds.
      <br/>
      The decay in the initial voltage was plotted verses time.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      4) LONGRUN: The belt was electrostatically cycled, according to the following sequence for each belt-drum revolution, for 4,000 drum revolutions: the belt was charged by the corona, the laser was cycled on and off to discharge a portion of the belt, and, finally, the erase lamp discharged the whole belt in preparation for the next cycle.
      <br/>
      The laser was cycled so that the first 16.7 cm of the belt was never exposed, the following 8 cm section was exposed, then 4 cm was unexposed, the next 8 cm section was exposed, and finally the last 12.5 cm was unexposed.
      <br/>
      This pattern was repeated for 4,000 drum revolutions and the data was collected during the first cycle and then after each 200th drum revolution.
    </p>
    <p num="112">5) After the 4,000th cycle (long run test), the PRODSTART (now called PRODEND), VLOGE, DARK DECAY tests were run again.</p>
    <p num="113">
      5. Wet Electrostatic Performance: A 29.12 cm * 96.52 cm sample of each OPR Example/Comparative Example was welded into a belt form and mounted into a mechanism having charge-discharge capabilities, an erase bar, and a steering mechanism designed to guide the OPR belt.
      <br/>
      It was run for 4,000 cycles or more.
      <br/>
      The coated surface of the sample is continuously applied with the carrier liquid during the course of the run, and the sample is checked periodically for crazing.
      <br/>
      Electrostatic data was collected from three probes following the corona charging, laser discharging, and erase stations.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      6. Adhesion to Release Layer: Wiping Test (i.e., Peel Force Test): OPR samples which have been coated with a top release layer were cut into six 3.175 cm wide X 10.16 cm long pieces cut in the coating direction of the OPR material.
      <br/>
      Three of the six pieces were mounted with silicone tape onto weighted shoes on a drum wiping mech.
      <br/>
      The release-coated surface of the samples was wiped with the carrier liquid soaked paper toweling (Kleenex Premiere brand from Kimberly Clark, Neenah, Wis.) for 800 rotational cycles.
      <br/>
      The paper toweling was then replaced with the carrier liquid soaked paper toweling prepared in the same manner, and the process is repeated three times for a total of 3200 cycles.
      <br/>
      The three finished samples were allowed to dry overnight.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, the three initial, unwiped samples were tested for 180-degree peel force/adhesion using a slip/peel force tester from Instrumentors, Inc.
      <br/>
      Once the three wiped samples dried, they were also tested for peel force/adhesion in the same manner, and the results were compared to the values of the unwiped samples.

      All samples were tested with tape commercially available under the trade designations -202 and -600, both from Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, St.

      In this evaluation, a high charge acceptance value and a low discharge value with low delta values and low dark decay values are a desired combination.
      <br/>
      For the delta values, a value of less than 40 was considered an acceptable value, with less than 20 being particularly desirable.
      <br/>
      A charge acceptance (V acc) value of more than about 600 V was preferred.
      <br/>
      A discharge value of less than about 50 V was preferred.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a dark decay value of less than 100 V was preferred.

      In the Examples above, Examples 18 and 21 were considered to be less acceptable than other examples.

      In Example 18, the delta value was too high.

      Example 21 exhibited a high dark decay value and a low charge acceptance (V acc) value.

      In conclusion, an improved barrier layer for an electrophotographic process is provided.
      <br/>
      The barrier layer containing methyl cellulose, methylvinyl ether/maleic anhydride copolymer, and crosslinker provided an excellent barrier layer to prevent the OPC from solvent and stress induced crazing.
      <br/>
      It also provided good electrostatic charging-discharge properties and excellent adhesion to the CGL.
      <br/>
      Additionally, as demonstrated above, adhesion of a barrier layer to the release layer can be further improved with the addition of a tie layer.
