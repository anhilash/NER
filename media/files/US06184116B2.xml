    <p num="4">
      In the fabrication of integrated circuits, photolithography and etching are used to form structures such as polysilicon gates, word lines, bit lines, local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS), shallow trench isolation (STI), and the like.
      <br/>
      A photoresist material is coated over the layer or layers to be etched.
      <br/>
      The photoresist material is exposed to actinic light through a mask, then developed to form the photoresist mask for etching the underlying layer or layers.
      <br/>
      Using optical lithography, a resolution as small as 0.13 microns can be achieved.
      <br/>
      For smaller feature sizes, electron beam or X-ray lithography is necessary.
      <br/>
      However, these types of photolithography are expensive and time-consuming.
      <br/>
      It is desired to find a way to achieve a controllable gate electrode having a width not limited by photolithographic resolution.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The process of the present invention can be used in any application where small feature sizes are desired.
      <br/>
      The process can be used to form bit lines, word lines, polysilicon gate electrodes, and the like.
      <br/>
      The drawing FIGS. 1-9 illustrate the process of the invention in making a polysilicon gate electrode.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the process of the invention can be used to make any structure where lithography and etching are used to form the structure and where small feature sizes are needed.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Also, FIGS. 11-15 illustrate a second preferred embodiment of the present invention in which the process for forming small feature sizes described in reference to FIGS. 1-9 is integrated with a process for also forming larger feature sizes using conventional photolithography processes.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The first preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 1-9. Referring now more particularly to FIG. 1, there is shown a semiconductor substrate 10.
      <br/>
      A thin silicon oxide layer 14 is grown on the surface of the substrate to a thickness of between about 50 and 100 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      A silicon nitride layer 16 is deposited over the thin silicon oxide layer 14 to a thickness of between about 200 and 500 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      This silicon nitride layer may be a thermal silicon nitride or may be deposited, for example, by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).
      <br/>
      Next, a third dielectric layer of tetraethoxy silane (TEOS) oxide 18 is deposited over the silicon nitride layer 16 to a thickness of between about 2000 and 3000 Angstroms.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Layer 14 is a protective layer for the silicon substrate and serves as an etch stop layer.
      <br/>
      This layer may be a thin thermal oxide or oxynitride, for example.
      <br/>
      Layers 16 and 18 are of different materials than layer 14 so that the etch will stop at this layer.
      <br/>
      Layer 16 may be omitted.
      <br/>
      Layer 18 may be TEOS or borophospho-TEOS (BPTEOS).
      <br/>
      If layer 16 is omitted, layer 18 may be BPTEOS.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The dielectric stack is patterned, as shown in FIG. 2, with an etch stop at the thin silicon oxide layer 14.
      <br/>
      The width A of the dielectric stack should be the desired spacing between gate electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Referring now to FIG. 3, the thin silicon oxide layer 14 is stripped using a wet etch process.
      <br/>
      This stripping process will not damage the underlying silicon substrate surface.
      <br/>
      For example, the wet etching recipe may be a solution of hydrofluoric acid (HF) in the ratio of 50:1 for about 1 to 2.5 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A gate oxide layer 20 is grown on the surface of the substrate to a thickness of between about 10 and 20 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      Because the silicon oxide layer 14 was stripped using a wet etch rather than a plasma etch process, the quality of the gate oxide layer 20 is good.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Referring now to FIG. 4, a thin polysilicon layer 24 is deposited over the surface of the gate oxide layer and the dielectric stack to a thickness of between about 700 and 3000 Angstroms, depending on the final gate width desired.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The polysilicon layer 24 is etched back using a dry etching process to leave polysilicon spacers 26 on the sidewalls of the dielectric stack, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      For example, etching gases such as Cl2, HBr, or He/O2 may be used.
      <br/>
      The gate oxide layer 20 not covered by the polysilicon spacers 26 is also removed.
      <br/>
      The polysilicon spacers 26 have a width B of between about 500 and 2500 Angstroms, and as small as about 300 Angstroms.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring now to FIG. 6, a layer a TEOS oxide 30 is deposited over the substrate to a thickness of between about 2000 and 3000 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      This layer should comprise the same material as the top layer 18 of the dielectric stack.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The TEOS layer 30 is polished back or etched back, for example by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) below the surface of the dielectric stack, as illustrated in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      About 1/3 of the stack, or about 400 to 600 Angstroms is etched back.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Referring now to FIG. 8, the TEOS layers 30 and 18 are stripped using a wet etch, for example a buffered oxide etch (BOE) at 10:1.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The remaining TEOS layer 30, the silicon nitride layer 16 and the thin silicon oxide layer 14 are stripped using a dry etch, as shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      Remaining are the gate electrodes 26 having width B. The width B of the gate electrode is controlled by the width of the polysilicon spacer.
      <br/>
      It is not limited by photolithographic resolution, but can be as small as 300 to 800 Angstroms or 0.3 to 0.8 microns.
      <br/>
      The polish back step is essential to form a usable gate structure having no top corner.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Processing continues as is conventional in the art.
      <br/>
      If, as illustrated in the drawing figures, gate electrodes have been fabricated by the process of the invention, source and drain regions 40 may be formed as shown in FIG. 10, interlevel dielectric 44 deposited and electrical contacts 48 completed, as is conventional.
      <br/>
      If the process of the invention is used to fabricate word lines or bit lines, passivation and further metallization may be provided as desired.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The process of the invention can also be used to integrate both very narrow and wide gate fabrication.
      <br/>
      The narrowest gate width is controlled by the polysilicon spacer width, using the process described hereinabove.
      <br/>
      The wide polysilicon lines are formed using conventional photolithography.
      <br/>
      This second preferred embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 11-15.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      For example, as illustrated in FIG. 11, dielectric stacks 50 are formed using the process of the invention described above and illustrated in FIGS. 1-3. The dielectric stacks are formed over those portions of the substrate where narrow features such as gate electrodes are to be formed.
      <br/>
      Next, as in FIG. 4, the thin polysilicon layer 24 is deposited over the gate oxide layer 20 and the dielectric stacks 50.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Then, a photoresist mask 55 is formed over the portion of the substrate where wide features such as polysilicon gates are to be formed.
      <br/>
      The polysilicon layer 24 is etched back, as shown in FIG. 12, using a dry etching process to leave polysilicon spacers 26 on the sidewalls of the dielectric stacks 50.
      <br/>
      This etching process is the same as that described above in reference to FIGS. 4 and 5.
      <br/>
      The polysilicon 24 covered by the photoresist mask 55 is protected from the etching.
      <br/>
      After etching, the mask 55 is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Referring now to FIG. 13, a layer a TEOS oxide 30 is deposited over the substrate to a thickness of between about 2000 and 3000 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      This layer should comprise the same material as the top layer 18 of the dielectric stack.
      <br/>
      The TEOS layer 30 is polished back or etched back, for example by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) below the surface of the dielectric stack, as illustrated in FIG. 14. About 1/3 of the stack, or about 400 to 600 Angstroms is etched back, as above.
      <br/>
      This film 30 is essential to protecting the gate oxide and the silicon substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The TEOS layers 30 and 18, the silicon nitride layer 16 and the thin silicon oxide layer 14 are stripped using wet and dry etches, as detailed above in reference to FIGS. 8 and 9.
      <br/>
      Remaining are the gate electrodes 26 having width B, shown in FIG. 15. The width B of the gate electrode is controlled by the width of the polysilicon spacer.
      <br/>
      It is not limited by photolithographic resolution, but can be as small as 300 to 800 Angstroms or 0.3 to 0.8 microns.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      A second photoresist mask 60 is formed over the substrate, completely covering the narrow polysilicon gates 26.
      <br/>
      The mask 60 is used to pattern the polysilicon 24 to form wide polysilicon lines, as shown in FIG. 15. In this way, the method of forming narrow width features can be integrated with forming wide features as well.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Processing continues as is conventional in the art and as described with reference to FIG. 10 to complete the integrated circuit device.
      <br/>
      For example, as illustrated in FIG. 16, source and drain regions 40 may be formed, interlevel dielectric 44 deposited and electrical contacts 48 completed, as is conventional.
      <br/>
      If the process of the invention is used to fabricate word lines or bit lines, passivation and further metallization may be provided as desired.
      <br/>
      Or, a passivation layer 50 may be deposited to complete the integrated circuit device.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The present invention provides a process for lithography and etching which supports feature sizes which are not limited by the resolution of the lithography process.
      <br/>
      Feature size is controlled by the width of a polysilicon spacer.
      <br/>
      The process of the invention can be used in any application where small feature sizes are desired.
      <br/>
