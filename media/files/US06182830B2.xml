      <br/>
      Field of Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to displayable jewellery box and particularly to the packaging, storage, and display for gifts such as watches, jewelleries, glasses, cosmetics, etc.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Arts</p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventionally, there are two kinds of displayable jewellery box: one's cover is linked to the box, thereof the side and back view of the product cannot be seen when it is displayed.
      <br/>
      Moreover, this kind of display wastes lots of space storage.
      <br/>
      Another one's cover can be separated from the box.
      <br/>
      While the product is displayed, the cover is separated from its box.
      <br/>
      By the way, it is inconvenient to place and is easy to lose the cover.
      <br/>
      Sometimes people clip the cover at the side of the box for convenience while displaying.
      <br/>
      However, the box has a restricted size, is difficult to manufacture, and is costly.
      <br/>
      People want to show their product to customers with the best view especially when the product is delicate and fine, such as jewellery.
      <br/>
      In addition, people want best protection for storage.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      According to most available jewellery boxes, salesman takes lots of time in packaging, sometimes they even cannot find the right cover to its box.
      <br/>
      So, people always have conflict between packaging and displaying.
      <br/>
      Ignoring the right packaging may depreciate the value of the product as well.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention relates to a displayable jewellery box that the cover can flip over and slide in order to improve the inadequacy of existing jewelry box.
      <br/>
      The product can be placed horizontally or at a certain angle for promotion while displaying.
      <br/>
      The box protects the product while storing or packaging.
      <br/>
      It prevents product from getting dusty as well.

      <br/>
      Tracks are placed on two inner side planes of the box, and pegs are placed on two outer side panels of the cover.
      <br/>
      These pegs correspond to the tracks and can rotate and slide inside the tracks freely.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Tracks on two inner side panels of the box are parallel to each other and correspond to the pegs on two outer side panels of the cover.</p>

    <p num="23">
      The drawings disclose illustrative embodiments of the present invention which serves to exemplify the object.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1, 2, and 4 illustrate the stages in storage and display of the present invention respectively.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1 and 4 illustrate the box and the cover without adhesive layer or frame.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The following paragraphs provide illustrations and descriptive manual of the present invention:</p>
    <p num="25">
      When opening the box, hold the front and back panels of the box 1, and flip the front and back panels of the cover 2 to the back.
      <br/>
      The bars 17 on two outer side panels of the cover 2 will separate from the grooves 16 on two inner side panels of the box 1.
      <br/>
      While the cover 2 is flipped over, the cover 2 will slide along the tracks 4 until it reaches the blocked end of the tracks.
      <br/>
      The display is formed by arranging the box 1 and the cover 2.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      When closing the box, hold the front panel of the cover 2.
      <br/>
      Pull and flip the cover 2 back along the tracks 4 until the bars 17 on two outer side panels of the cover 2 slide back to the grooves 16 on two inner side panels of the box 1, so it will be back to a closed position.
      <br/>
      The cover 2 of the present invention will close tightly to prevent product from getting dusty.
      <br/>
      The shiny surface of the box also allows product display to customer with the best view.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      FIG. 3 is a partially cutaway view of the box 1, each panel at two ends of the box 1 can be half-open.
      <br/>
      Parallel tracks on two corresponding inner side planes are adjusted to the pegs 3 on the cover 2 from rotating and sliding freely.
      <br/>
      The length of the track 4 cannot exceed the front and back end panels.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Referring to FIG. 3, there are three directions of tracks on two inner side panels corresponding to the box 1.
      <br/>
      The tracks 4 are parallel to the bottom plane, the tracks 4' are at slanted angle to the bottom plane, and the tracks 4" are perpendicular to the bottom plane.
      <br/>
      With these different directions of tracks, the product can be displayed at different angles to stand out its feature.
      <br/>
      Three different directions of the track are shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      For convenience, the hidden line shown in the figure indicates there is the same starting point for three different directions of the tracks.
    </p>
    <p num="29">When the tracks 4 on two inner side panels are perpendicular to the bottom plane of the box 1, the length of two side panels of the box 1 should be greater or equal to its width in order to put the cover 2 perpendicularly into the box 1.</p>
    <p num="30">
      Referring to FIG. 4, the front end of the cover 2 can install a piece of supporting board 5.
      <br/>
      When the box is used for storage, the supporting board 5 can cover the gap between the box 1 and the cover 2.
      <br/>
      When the box is used for displaying, the supporting board 5 will support the box on the drawer and allow the cover to be placed at a slanted angle.
      <br/>
      Then, the product displayed on the cover will also offer a slanted view, and will satisfy the need of different styles of display.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      When for a flat cover 2, the cover can be directly opened the cover for product display.
      <br/>
      A side pocket is placed inside the cover 2 for carrying the instruction manual.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the product can be taken out from the box 1 including the base and put on the cover 2 which is flipped and set already.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 5 is a figurative view of the displayable jewellery box wherein the box is used for storage.
      <br/>
      The hinge is a joint to connect the supporting board 5 and the cover 2 together.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Referring to FIG. 6, at the open end, the slanted cover can slide back and forth on parallel tracks 4 at the two corresponding inner side planes.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the base can be lifted up for a better view of the product.
      <br/>
      At one ends of the tracks 4 are blocked by a stopper while the other ends can be either blocked or not.
      <br/>
      It is convenient to slide the cover 2 into the track 4 with only one end of the track is blocked.
      <br/>
      When both ends of the tracks are blocked, the bent peg 3 can be installed into the track 4.
      <br/>
      The height of stopper should be less or equal to the depth of the track.
      <br/>
      In order to keep the shape of the box for storage, pillars 7 placed on the open end of two side panels will support the side panel 14 of the cover 2 when the box is closed.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Referring to FIG. 7, the cover 2 comprises pegs 3, a side panel 14, and a three-piece of front plane 15.
      <br/>
      The narrow bar-shape pegs 3 are mainly use for jointing the box 1 and the cover 2.
      <br/>
      Side panel 14 is connected between the pegs 3 and the front panel 15.
      <br/>
      When three parts combine into one piece, it becomes a box-shaped side part of the box 1.
      <br/>
      When the box 1 and the cover 2 collide together, the edges of the cover 2 will easily indent.
      <br/>
      So, two side panels of the box 1 and two side-edges of the cover 2 have grooves 12 and 13 respectively for protection (as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8).
      <br/>
      These grooves 12 and 13 correspond to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The front plane 15 is mainly used for display.
      <br/>
      There is a stage on the front plane 15 that offers clipping, assembling, and adhering installations.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a base 10 can be placed on the stage for supporting different variety, structure, size, and design of products.
      <br/>
      The product can be clipped, sticked, or screwed onto the base 10 and can be placed flat or at a slanted angle for display.
      <br/>
      The height and shape of the product is coordinated to the volume of the box 1.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      A lock is placed at the front end of the front plane 15 of the cover 2 which the lock is manufactured of clip, button, or magnet.
      <br/>
      For special needs, the product can be placed at a greater slanted angle for display.
      <br/>
      The front plane 15 can be bent into two parts.
      <br/>
      One part is called front-end plane 8 and other is called secondary plane 9.
      <br/>
      The front plane 15 can be bent backward to the box 1 and the base is affixed on the front plane 15 at a slanted angle by the hinge (as shown in FIG. 8).
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The folding lines of the joint between the pegs 3, the side planes 14, and the front plane 15, and the joint between the secondary plane 9 and the front plane 15 are designed either at the middle or on the side.
      <br/>
      The hinge will be used as a joint to support the box at a slanted angle.
      <br/>
      For the best result, the hinge with a right angle will be used.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      When display, flip the pegs 3 on the cover back, and slide the cover 2 along the tracks 4 on two inner side planes of the box 1 horizontally or at a slanted angle.
      <br/>
      The product on the cover will be displayed horizontally or at a slanted angle as well.
      <br/>
      When storing, follow the direction above inversely.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      After the box is manufactured, an artistic decoration such as metal plates or cotton goods can be placed on the surfaces of the box.
      <br/>
      Additionally, use an advertisement or an instruction manual to set off the product is an alternative method for decoration.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The concept of the present invention is diverse.
      <br/>
      The box can be square or rectangular.
      <br/>
      The corners of the box are right angle, round, and cut.
      <br/>
      We will not discus further in here.
