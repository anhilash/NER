    <p num="4">However, in those drugs which have been already known, their relaxing action of tracheal smooth muscles in airway diseases and pulmonary diseases such as bronchial asthma, acute and chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema and upper esophagitis is not satisfactory in terms of a balance with the side effect.</p>
    <p num="5">In view of the above, an object of the present invention is to offer drugs having novel relaxing action to tracheal smooth muscle exhibiting far better action to airway diseases, etc.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">In order to solve the above problems, the present invention offers a tracheal smooth muscle relaxant containing the compound represented by the following formula (1) or pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof as an effective ingredient.  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="7">�In the formula, X and Y each is any group selected from a group consisting of CH2, CHW1 (where W1 is halogen atom, hydroxyl group or lower alkoxy group, and C.dbd.O when the bond of X and Y is a single bond, while when it is a double bond, X and Y each is any group selected from a group consisting of CH and COW2 (where W2 is lower alkyl group or lower alkylcarbonyl group); Z is O, S, S.dbd.O or SO2 ; and R1.about.R8 each is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen atom, VR9 (where V is O, S, S.dbd.O or SO2 ; and R9 is hydrogen atom, lower alkyl group, hydroxy lower alkyl group, lower acyl group, trihalomethyl group or carboxyl lower alkyl group), carboxyl lower alkyl group, hydroxy lower alkyl group, hydroxy lower alkenyl group, hydroxy lower alkynyl group, halogen atom, lower alkyl group, lower alkyl ketone, trihalomethyl group, trimethylsilylethynyl, nitro group, amino group, N-carbonyl lower alkyl group, lower alkylphenyl group and phenyl group�.</p>
