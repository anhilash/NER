      Process for the formation of MeO-Peg-protected dihydroquinine or dihydro quinindine derivatives, new dihydroquinine-or dihyroquinidine derivatives as well as the use thereof.
      <br/>
      It is known that dihydroquinine or dihydroquinidine derivatives can be successfully used as ligands in the enantioselective dihydroxylation.
      <br/>
      The new disclosed ligand systems based on dihydroquinine/quinidine, unlike the prior art ligands, can be recycled after enantioselective dihydroxylation by precipitating and filtering the reaction medium, and be reused in the reaction medium.
      <br/>
      Also disclosed are the ligand systems (I) and (IV), process for preparing the same and their use in the enantioselective dihydroxiation of double bonds.

      In Chem.
      <br/>
      Rev. 1994, 94, 2483 (Sharpless, et al), there are described monomeric catalyst systems for enantioselective dihydroxylation based on dihydroquinine and dihydroquinidine derivatives.
      <br/>
      Although the inantio-selectivity of the charged catalysts is very high, the charged ligands are disadvantageous in the respect that it is difficult or not possible to recycle them and where this is possible, only with poor yield (liquid-liquid extraction yield clearly under 80%).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 7632-3 (Janda, et al), there is mentioned the formation of MeO-Peg-protected dihydroquinine, as well as its application in the enantioselective dihydroxylation of double bond containing compounds.
      <br/>
      The catalyst system mentioned therein achieves the enantioselective dihydroxylation of standard compounds at a level up to 30% worse ee levels as the original system found in Sharpless, et al.

      In Table 1 there are set forth the best enantioselectivities achieved by Janda, et al and Sharpless, et al, in the dihydroxylation of standard compounds with their catalyst or ligand systems.
      <br/>
      Clearly, the polymer binding of the ligand system under the reaction conditions optimized for a single system, leads to drastically worse ee values.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">The invention refers to new dihydroquinine or dihydroquinidine derivatives of Formulas (I) and (IV), obtainable by the procedures of the present invention, as well as their use for the enantioselective dihydroxylation of double bonds.</p>
    <p num="8">
      The task of the invention was therefore to develop a procedure for the formation of a catalyst system, which gives rise to good ee values such as in the original Sharpless procedure during dihydroxylation and which can be readily separated from the reaction mixture and so becomes available for a new reaction cycle.
      <br/>
      The task of the invention was further the provision of new catalyst systems that can serve for the asymmetric dihydroxylation of double bonds, as well as the manner and use of their application.
    </p>
    <p num="9">The invention involves a procedure for the manufacture of dihydroquinine derivatives of Formula (I)  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>

    <p num="24">The new ligand systems of Formulas (I) and (V) are furthermore the subject of the present invention.</p>

      The object of the present invention is also the use of the new ligand systems (I) and (IV) which advantageously permit, in the presence of oxidizing agents such as N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide, potassium hexacyanoferrate and/or potassium osmate in a solvent mixture to the dihydroxylation of a double bond in very high enantiomeric excess.
      <br/>
      A preferred use in accordance with this invention provides that the dihydroxylation is carried out in a solvent mixture containing one or more of the solvents of the group: water, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, N-propanol, N-butanol, secondary butanol, tert.-butanol, isobutanol, N-pentanol; ethers such as diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxy ethane, dioxane; ketones such as acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethyl ketone (sic), diisopropyl ketone; or esters such as acetyl acetic esters or acetic esters, as well as halogenated alkanes such as methylene chloride, chloroform, and trichlorethylene.
      <br/>
      Preferred solvent mixtures are among others, water tert.butanol, or water acetone.
      <br/>
      It is particularly advantageous to provide the solvent mixture from at least two of the above-named solvents.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the catalysts (I) and (IV) can be readily precipitated after the dihydroxylation by the addition of non-polar organic solvents to the reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      To the hereto preferred addable solvent materials, there may be counted for example, alkane, such as hexane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane; petroleum ethers or ether (sic).
