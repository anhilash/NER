    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      The invention relates to new annelated dihydropyridinoacetic acid derivatives, processes for preparing them and pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art including information disclosed under 37 CFR 1.97 and 1.98.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Dihydroisoquinolines are known from EP-A 37 934.
      <br/>
      The compounds specified therein are cardiotonically active and have the effects of increasing contractility and influencing blood pressure.
      <br/>
      They have been proposed for improving blood circulation through the tissues and for improving the oxygen supply to the tissues.
      <br/>
      These possible uses are based on the vascular activity of the compounds.
      <br/>
      EP-A 251 194 and EP-A 288 048 describe how carbocyclically and heterocyclically annelated dihydropyridines have a cardioprotective or cerebroprotective activity and constitute an entirely new type of Ca-antagonistic compounds.
      <br/>
      WO 92/11010 describes the use of such compounds for cerebroprotective agents, for treating chronic inflammatory processes and for inhibiting blood clotting and blood platelet aggregation.

    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      The present invention relates to new carbocyclically and heterocyclically annelated dihydropyridines and the pharmaceutical use of these compounds.
      <br/>
      The new compounds have valuable therapeutically useful properties.
      <br/>
      They may be used as cardioprotective agents, as cerebroprotective agents (particularly for treating patients who have suffered a stroke or are in danger of suffering a stroke) and as agents for treating chronically inflammatory processes (e.g. bronchial asthma and arthritis).
      <br/>
      These compounds may also be used as agents with an antiproliferative effect and as agents for treating ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

      The residue is dissolved in 10 ml of absolute acetone, 900 mg (10 Mmol) of oxalic acid are added and the salt is precipitated in crystalline form after the addition of about 50 ml of absolute diethylether.

      The compounds are valuable in the treatment of degenerative and necrotic diseases of the brain.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to provide preventative treatment for patients who are at risk from such diseases.
      <br/>
      The effect of the compounds is not based on an improvement in the blood flow through the tissues.
      <br/>
      The compounds are therefore suitable for a new kind of treatment of epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease and particularly for treating patients who have suffered a stroke or are at risk of suffering a stroke.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      The present invention further relates to the use of the above compounds for preparing agents for the treatment of chronic inflammatory processes, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and agents with an antiproliferative activity.
      <br/>
      The effect of the compounds can be explained by their inhibition of the unselective cation channels (UCC).
    </p>
    <p num="95">The pathophysiology of chronic bronchial asthma is based on inflammatory processes which are mediated by the activation of inflammatory cells. (BARNES, 1987; SEIFERT and SCHULTZ, 1991).</p>
    <p num="96">
      The receptor-regulated activation of inflammatory cells (e.g. neutrophilic granulocytes and mast cells or the permanent cell lines HL-60 cells or sensitised RBL cells, i.e. those charged with gammaglobulin E) is inhibited, irrespective of the nature of the stimulating agonists (e.g. endothelin, PAF, leukotrienes, chemotactical peptide fMLP or antigen against sensitised mast cells) by blockers of unselective cation channels (UCC) (RINK, 1990).
      <br/>
      Through these channels extracellular calcium, which is responsible for the persistence of receptor-mediated cell activations, enters the cells (PUTNEY, 1990).
      <br/>
      If this supply of calcium is interrupted this results in a blockade of the activation of inflammatory cells.
    </p>
    <p num="97">Conventional calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine or phenylalkylamine type do not inhibit either UCCs or inflammatory processes (WELLS et al., 1986).</p>
    <p num="98">
      As a measurement of the cell activation or as a measurement of the inhibition thereof by UCC blockers, the kinetics of the cytoplasmic calcium ion concentration in fura-2-charged cells is quantified fluorometrically using the method described by GRYNKIEWICZ et al. (1985).
      <br/>
      This procedure has proved a reliable screening method, within the scope of the invention, for detecting UCC blockers.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      So-called functional THAPSIGARGIN inhibition has proved suitable for the specific characterisation of blockers of the unselective cation channels.
      <br/>
      THAPSIGARGIN is a tumour promoter described by THASTRUP et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 87, 2466-2470, 1990) which selectively and irreversibly inhibits the Ca2+ -ATPase of intracellular IP3 -sensitive Ca2+ -stores.
      <br/>
      Consequently the Ca2+ -stores are rapidly depleted.
      <br/>
      As described by J. PUTNEY (Calcium, 11, 611-624, 1990) the depletion of these stores constitutes the physiological stimulation for opening up unselective cation channels in the cell membrane.
      <br/>
      The result of this is a massive influx of Na+ and Ca2+ into the cell.
      <br/>
      Because of these properties, Thapsigargin is suitable as an indirect stimulator for agonist- and IP3 -independent opening up of the unselective cation channels.
    </p>
    <p num="100">Within the scope of the present invention the Thapsigargin stimulation of unselective cation channels has been carried out successfully on HL 60 cells (human leukaemia cells), on hippocampal and cortical neurone cells and on RBL-cells (rat basophilic lymphoma cells) and in this way the existence of these channels in particular cell lines was demonstrated.</p>
    <p num="101">
      The cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (�Ca2+ �i) plays an important part in the cell proliferation and in tumour growth (for a summary see L. R. ZACHARSKI, Journal of Medicine 19: 145-177, 1988).
      <br/>
      In particular, the Ca2+ -influx into the cell stimulated by receptor activation with consecutive inositoltriphosphate-(IP3 -)-mediation would appear to be of crucial importance for oncogenic cell proliferation (U.
      <br/>
      KIKKAWA and Y. NISHIZUKA, Ann.
      <br/>
      REV. CELL. BIOL. 2: 149-178, 1986).
      <br/>
      This mechanism also plays a part in the formation of metastases and in "Multi-Drug Resistance". (For a summary see the above-mentioned publication by L. R. ZACHARSKI, J. MED. 19: 145-177, 1980).
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      This hypothesis is supported by the fact that Thapsigargin, as an indirect stimulator of the unselective cation channels (UCC) not only leads to a Ca2+ -overload in the cell but is also a highly effective tumour promoter. (V. THASTRUP et al.
      <br/>
      Proceedings of the NATL.
      <br/>
      Acad. Sci: (USA) 87: 2466-2470, 1990).
      <br/>
      The blockade of the Ca2+ -influx by the UCC leads to normalisation of the intracellular Ca-ion concentration and hence to inhibition of tumour growth etc.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Conventional calcium antagonists do not inhibit these UCC.
      <br/>
      It has been found, surprisingly, that the compounds according to this invention inhibit the influx of calcium into the cell through the UCC.

    <p num="104">
      As shown by S. H. MURCH et al. (Lancet 339 : 381-385, Feb. 15, 1992) endothelin I plays an important pathophysiological role in inflammatory intestinal diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
      <br/>
      Using immunohistochemical methods it has been shown that patients with Crohn's disease in the region of the submucosa and patients with ulcerative colitis in the region of the lamina propria of the epithelium of the large intestine show significantly and greatly increased concentrations of endothelin I compared with healthy normal people.
      <br/>
      It is assumed that the local secretion of endothelin causes massive vasospasms with consecutive disseminated ischaemia with microinfarcts which are regarded as the actual cause of the above diseases.
      <br/>
      The vasospasmogenic effectiveness of endothelin is explained by a Ca2+ -overload of vascular myocytes.
      <br/>
      Endothelin primarily triggers an IP3 -mediated intracellular release of Ca2+ which is followed by a massive transmembranal Ca2+ -entry through dihydropyridine-insensitive channels. (M. S. Simonson et al.
      <br/>
      Clin. Invest. Med. 14: 499-507, 1991; T. Masakai, J. Cardiovasc.
      <br/>
      Pharmacol. 13:Suppl. 5, S1-S4, 1989; D. W. Hay, R. J. Pharmacol. 100: 383-392, 1990).
      <br/>
      These channels are unselective cation channels which have also been briefly described as existing in cells of the large intestine mudosa. (Chr. Siemer and H. Gogelein, Europ. J. Physiol. 420: 319-328, 1992).
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      The endothelin-stimulated activation of fura-2-charged human leukaemia cells (HL 60 cells) has proved a suitable screening model for detecting functional endothelin antagonists.
      <br/>
      In conformity with G. GRYNKIEWICZ et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 260:3440-3450, 1985) the intracellular Ca2+ -concentration in the cytoplasm of HL 60 cells (suspensions) can be monitored by spectrofluorometry and quantified as a measurement of cell activation by endothelin.
      <br/>
      The stimulation was effected by adding 0.1 mM endothelin and could be inhibited in a dosage-dependent manner by means of the substances according to the invention.

    <p num="106">The functional endothelin antagonism of the substances according to the invention is mediated through a blockade of the unselective cation channels.</p>
    <p num="107">Consequently, detection of a functional Thapsigargin-antagonism on RBL-hm1 cells is also a suitable screening method for functional endothelin antagonists.</p>
    <p num="108">Carrying out the investigation:</p>
    <p num="109">
      For screening purposes, fura-2-charged adhesive RBL-hm 1 cells are stimulated with 0.1  MU M Thapsigargin in a Ca2+ -free incubation medium.
      <br/>
      After 4 minutes, extracellular Ca2+ is restored to a concentration of 1.5 mM and, using the fura-2-fluorescence, the excessive increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ -concentration caused by a massive transmembranal Ca2+ -entry through unselective cation channels is recorded.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      This entry is to be inhibited solely by unselective cation channel blockers in a dosage-dependent manner.
      <br/>
      Neither conventional calcium antagonists nor specific blockers of agonists which stimulate the IP3 -turnover are able to inhibit the transmembranal Ca2+ -entry triggered indirectly by Thapsigargin.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the present invention are distinguished by their inhibition of UCC.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      The fluorometric calcium measurement in the cytoplasm of individual adhering RBL-hm1 cells is carried out analogously to the method described by KUDO and OGURA (1986) for neuronal cells.
      <br/>
      An AXIOVERT 35 fluorescence microscope made by ZEISS is used in conjunction with an imaging system made by HAMAMATSU, consisting of the ICMS-image processing system, residual light camera with control unit and image intensifier DVS 3000.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      The kinetics of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ -concentration is recorded continuously as a concentration/time curve after the cell activation stimulated by Thapsigargin (0.1  MU M).
      <br/>
      The curves of two activated cell cultures are compared in the presence and absence of 10  MU M test substance.
      <br/>
      The area under these curves (area under the curve=AUC) is integrated and recorded as a measurement of cell activation.
      <br/>
      The inhibitory potency of the UCC-blockers tested is determined using the following equation:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="113">% H=the percentage inhibition of the calcium entry through unselective cation channels which is stimulated and inhibited by 10  MU M of test substance.</p>
    <p num="114">AUCinh =area under the curve recorded in the presence of the stimulant plus 10  MU M inhibitory test substance.</p>

      IMMUNOL. METH. 65: 55-63, 1983), DENIZOT et al. (J. IMMUNOL. METH. 89: 271-277, 1986) and J. ELIASON et al. (INT. J. CANCER 46: 113-117, 1990). (MTT=�3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide� produced by CHEMICON Inc.
      <br/>
      El Segundo, Calif., USA).
      <br/>
      This indicator is metabolised only by living cells with intact mitochondria into a blue formazane product.
      <br/>
      The following human tumour cell lines were used in our test: A 549 (adenocarcinoma of the lung), A 431 (epidermal carcinoma of the vulva), PC 3 (adenocarcinoma of the prostate), SK BR 3 (adenocarcinoma of the breast), HT 29 (CX1 1) (adenocarcinoma of the colon) and K 562 (chronic myeloid leukaemia cell).
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      The test was carried out on microtitre plates.
      <br/>
      Each well contained 100  MU l of a cell suspension (0.2 * 106 cells per ml).
      <br/>
      The incubation medium used was RPMI 1640 with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calves serum and 50  MU g/ml of gentamycin.
      <br/>
      The cell suspensions were incubated for 0, 24, 48 or 72 hours in air with a humidity at saturation point in a CO2 (5%)/air (95%) mixture at 37 (degree)  C., incubated in the presence and absence of variable concentrations of antiproliferative test substances.
      <br/>
      The test substances were dissolved in DMSO (final dilution: 0.1%).
      <br/>
      Then 10  MU l of MTT-solution (3 mg/ml) were added, followed after 3 hours by 100  MU l of an isopropanol solution containing 0.08 N HCl. After a further hour, the light absorption at 570 nm (comparative wavelength 630 nm) was determined in a microplate reader.
      <br/>
      The light absorption is directly proportional to the number of living cells.
      <br/>
      The half-maximum inhibitory concentrations of the substances tested were 1  MU g/ml.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      The vasospasmolytic effectiveness of the above-mentioned functional endothelin and Thapsigargin antagonists were confirmed on an isolated blood vessel preparation: coronary perfusion was continuously quantified, on retrogressively perfused, spontaneously beating LANDENDORFF hearts taken from rats, by means of electromagnetic flow measurement (apparatus supplied by Hugo Sachs Elektronik, MARCH).
      <br/>
      This measuring apparatus could be used to record the extent, duration and pattern of vascular spasms with a high degree of accuracy.
      <br/>
      If perfusion is carried out with 100 nM endothelin concentration, the coronary perfusion flow is reduced from 11 to 5 ml/min.
      <br/>
      The restriction in perfusion can be reversed by means of the substances according to the invention.
      <br/>
      The potencies of the compounds according to the invention with regard to Thapsigargin inhibition on fura-2-charged RBL-hm1-cells or the effectiveness of endothelin-inhibition on fura-2-charged HL 60 cells correlates clearly with the vasospasmolytic effectiveness of the test substances detected on the Langendorff preparation.
      <br/>
      It can be concluded from this that, underlying the vasospasmolytic endothelin antagonism of the substances tested, there is a blockade of the unselective cation channels.
