      A drip annunciator comprises a main body and a needle bottle capable of inserting into a drip bottle for outputting liquid.
      <br/>
      A buoyancy body is received in the needle bottle, which may move with the liquid level.
      <br/>
      The bottom of the buoyancy body is installed with a magnet and a magnetic sensor on a control rod at the lower side thereof.
      <br/>
      Thus, as the liquid level within the drip bottle has descended to a predetermined position, the magnet will actuate the magnetic sensor to be electrically conducted, and then the buzzer at another side emits an alarm or lights up an alarm light so inform one to update the liquid therewithin.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, a rolling ball will seal the liquid opening to prevent air to flow inwards so as to safeguard the life of a patient.
      <br/>
      Besides, another soft tube can be disposed between the liquid transferring tube and the needle bottle, and an adjusting wheel and a screw rod screwedly through the central screw hole and having a tightening block are installed aside.
      <br/>
      When the adjusting wheel is rotated so that the tightening block to press the soft tube at different level, the output of the liquid is controlled.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to an drip annunciator, and especially to a annunciator installed between a drip bottle and a liquid transferring tube, the flow can be adjusted, as the nutrient solution in the drip bottle will be used up, it can be detected so as to emit an alarm or a light to inform the medical members to update the liquid therewithin.
      <br/>
      Thus, the drip bottle can be used with a higher safety.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      As shown in FIG. 1, a use of conventional drip bottle 10 is illustrated.
      <br/>
      The needle 12 for inserting into a bottle is inserted into the soft plug in a drip bottle 10 for transferring the nutrient solution in the bottle.
      <br/>
      A regulator 13 for controlling the output flow of the nutrient solution is installed at a proper place on the liquid transferring tube 11 so as to supplement the required nutrient to a patient with a proper amount.
      <br/>
      However, in the simple structure, once the nutrient solution in the drip bottle 10 is exhausted without being supplemented in time.
      <br/>
      Then, it is possible that the patient will be hurt.
      <br/>
      Moreover, once air is possible flow into the blood vessel, the life of the patient will be threatened.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Accordingly, the primary object of the present invention is to provide a drip annunciator, as the level of the liquid in the drip bottle is too low, an alarm is emitted to inform the guarding people and seal the opening the liquid.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the buoyancy principle and magnetic attraction principle are used.
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="9">
      With reference to FIGS. 2 to 11, the relative figures about one preferred embodiment of the drip annunciator according to the present invention are illustrated.
      <br/>
      The drip annunciator of the present invention includes a main body 2 formed by a first half case 20 and a second half case 21, a cavity 200 extending upwards and downwards are installed therewithin.
      <br/>
      A lateral side of the cavity 200 is further installed with an L shape through hole 203 connected to the cavity 200, and an L shape adapting sleeve 30 is installed at the connection therebetween.
      <br/>
      The bottom of the cavity 200 has a penetrating hole 204 horizontally penetrating therethrough.
      <br/>
      Besides, a positioning groove 205 is arranged to be parallel to the lateral side of the through hole 203 for being receiving an adjusting wheel 23.
      <br/>
      At one side of the positioning groove 205 facing to the through hole 203 is formed with a via hole 206 for being screwed through the central screw hole 232 of the adjusting wheel 23.
      <br/>
      The screw rod 230 of the tightening block 231 can be screwed thereinto and is movable backwards and forwards by rotating the adjusting wheel 23.
      <br/>
      Moreover, one side of the main body 2 is installed with a buzzer 22 or other annunciator with alarming function.
      <br/>
      The buzzer is further installed with a receptacle 222.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A hollow needle bottle 3 has a bottom for being inserted into one end of the adapting sleeve 30 in order to be inserted into the drip bottle 5.
      <br/>
      Another end of the adapting sleeve 30 is further connected to a soft tube 32 extending along the through hole 203 for being further connected to a liquid transferring tube 32 at the lower side.
      <br/>
      The tube wall of the needle bottle 3 is installed with an axial extending liquid inlet 33, while the interior thereof is received with a buoyancy body 34 moving the water surface, as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      An axial tangent plane 35 is at the lateral side with respective to the inner wall of the liquid outlet 36 at the bottom thereof.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, a tangent plane 340 is installed at the respective lateral side of the buoyancy body 34.
      <br/>
      The tangent plane 340 is installed with a downward inclined concave hole 341.
      <br/>
      A rolling ball 342 is received within the concave hole 341.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as the buoyancy body 34 descends with the liquid surface, by the tangent plane 340 and tangent plane 35, the rotation of the buoyancy body 34 is confined so that as the liquid surface descends to a critical height.
      <br/>
      The rolling ball 342 exactly rolls down automatically to seal the liquid outlet 36 so as to interrupt the output of the liquid and seal the liquid transferring tube 32.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      A magnet 34 is installed at the bottom of the buoyancy body 34 and a magnetic sensor 4 electrically connected to the buzzer 22 is installed at a proper position of the main body 2 of the magnet 40.
      <br/>
      On embodiment of the magnetic sensor 4 includes two electric joints 221 installed at the bottom of the adapting sleeve 30 and a magnetic guide body 42 installed in the groove 420 on the controlling rod 41 in the penetrating hole 204 and movably lifting, or device which is electrically conductive by a reed switch or other magnetic force.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Thereby, as shown in FIG. 5, in using, the needle bottle 3 is inserted into a drip bottle 5 so that nutrient solution can flow into the needle bottle 3 through the liquid inlet 33.
      <br/>
      Then, it is output by the soft tube 31 and liquid transferring tube 32 to the body of a patient.
      <br/>
      While as using the nutrient solution as that liquid level descends to a predetermined critical level, the buoyancy body 34 within the needle bottle 3 will descend with the liquid level to automatically cause the rolling ball 342 to seal the liquid opening 36, as shown in FIG. 6, to prevent air to flow into the bottle so as to harm the patient's body.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the magnet 40 at bottom of the buoyancy body 34 will abstract the magnetic guiding body 42 to lift upwards so as to contact the two joints 221 at the bottom of the adapting sleeve 30.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the two joints 221 are electrically conductive so as to actuate the buzzer 22 to emit a proper alarm and thus to inform the medical members or the guarding people to supplement new liquid in time to steady the sickness of the patient.
    </p>
    <p num="13">However, in sleeping, in order not to interrupt the patient due to the buzz noise, the connecting plug 223 originally to the guardroom of the medical members is connected to a receptacle 222 attached to the buzzer 22 so that the alarm message only transfers to the guardroom, or lights up an alarming light 24 at the main body 2 in order not to interrupt the sleep of the patient.</p>
    <p num="14">As the use in aforesaid condition with referring to FIG. 6, in order to prevent that two joints 221 are conductive continuously due to the contact of iron pieces 42 or to prevent that since the needle bottle 3 does not be inserted into the drip bottle 5 so that the buoyancy body 34 is still in the bottom of the needle bottle 3 and thus the buzzer 22 emits continuously, as shown in FIG. 9, the control rod 41 can be pushed to cause the magnetic guiding body enforce the iron piece 42 to separate from the two joints 221 and therefore, a manual turning off is formed to shut down the buzzer 22 for preventing interruption.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Moreover, in order to match the different timing of different patients, the flow of the liquid transferring tube 32 can be controlled by rotating the adjusting wheel 23.
      <br/>
      The critical structure is that the adjusting wheel 23 and the screw rod 230 of the tightening block 231 may axially move by rotation.
      <br/>
      While in whole open, the screw rod 230 and tightening block 231 withdraws from the soft tube 31 to release the tightening pressure so to retain the liquid in full flow.
      <br/>
      However, as desired, by rotating the adjusting wheel 23, the screw rod 230 and the tightening block 231 will move forward to resist against the soft tube 31, as shown in FIG. 11, by reduction of the radial surface of the tube, the liquid flow can be decreased or even be interrupted.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the operation is more convenient, easily and comfort to achieve a preferred guarding effect.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
