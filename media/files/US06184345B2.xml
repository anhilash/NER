    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Biologically active peptides are conformationally restricted through cyclization to achieve metabolic stability, to increase potency, to confer or improve receptor selectivity, and to control bioavailability.
      <br/>
      The use of medium and long-range cyclization to convert natural bioactive peptides into potential peptidomimetic drugs has been prompted by the ability to control these important pharmacological characteristics.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the structural constraints on a peptide brought about by cyclization also enhance conformational homogeneity and facilitate conformational analysis.
      <br/>
      See, e.g., Kessler, H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng. 21:512 (1982).
      <br/>
      Thus, cyclization may give insight into the biologically active conformations of linear peptides provided that their biological activities and selectivities are maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Common modes of long-range (or global) peptide cyclization include side-chain to side-chain, end-group to end-group, and side-chain to end-group, all of which require the alteration or removal of residue side chains.
      <br/>
      See, e.g., Manesis, N. J., and Goodman, M. Org. Chem. 52:5331 (1987).
      <br/>
      Backbone cyclization, wherein a connection is made between the N ALPHA  and/or C ALPHA  atoms of a peptidic backbone, does not require such disruption of the peptide's natural structure because only the hydrogens of the peptide bond are affected.
      <br/>
      The hydrogens are replaced by  OMEGA -functionalized chains that can be interconnected, connected to residue side-chains, or connected to the ends of a peptide to form the desired cyclic peptide.
      <br/>
      Backbone cyclization can thus stabilize a peptide's bioactive conformation and protect against its enzymatic degradation without altering its side chains.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Although different methods of backbone cyclization exist, a preferred method uses dipeptide building blocks.
      <br/>
      Gilon and coworkers have disclosed backbone to side-chain and backbone to C-terminus peptide cyclization using lactam and disulfide bridges formed from such building blocks.
      <br/>
      This was done with the use of N-aminoalkyl amino acids obtained either by the alkylation of amino, carboxy or thiol alkyl amines with triflates of  ALPHA -hydroxy acids, or by the nucleophilic substitution of alkylene diamines. U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,575 and Gilon et al., J. Org. Chem. 57: 5687-5692 (1992) (collectively "Gilon").
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the first method of synthesizing N-aminoalkyl amino acids, a diamine is reacted with an  ALPHA  bromo acid to provide an  OMEGA  amine which is then selectively protected.
      <br/>
      Variation of the protecting group provides a building unit suitable for Boc chemistry peptide synthesis.
      <br/>
      In the second method of synthesizing these building units, a selectively protected diamine is reacted with chloroacetic acid to provide a protected glycine derivative suitable for Fmoc peptide synthesis.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In order to take advantage of the facile nucleophilic displacement of carboxylic acid substituents, both synthetic methods described by Gilon require the reaction of a molecule of formula Halides-CH(R)--CO--OR' (wherein Halides represents a halogen leaving group) and an amine.
      <br/>
      The amine bears an alkylidene chain that is terminated by another amine, as shown in Scheme (I):  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="8">The terminating nitrogen atom of the resulting building unit will be contained by the moiety used to form the bridging chain of a cyclized peptide.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In a molecule where R is other than hydrogen, there is a high tendency to eliminate H-Halides under basic conditions.
      <br/>
      And because the secondary amine formed by the addition reaction is a better nucleophile than the primary amine of the diamine reactant, double alkylation products may form.
      <br/>
      This side reaction reduces the yield of the method shown in Scheme (I) to such an extent that it cannot be used for the practical production of building units based on amino acids other than glycine.
      <br/>
      Gilon, however, does not suggest backbone cyclization building units having end-group moieties that are not amine, and so only provides compounds useful in backbone to side-chain and backbone to C terminus peptide cyclization.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Other workers have described alternative backbone cyclization building blocks.
      <br/>
      For example, lactam bridges have been formed with the protected building block HN(CH2 COOBut)Phe, although the synthesis of bradykinin analogues using the Boc protected building block was reportedly hindered by low yields and undesired double couplings.
      <br/>
      Reissman et al.
      <br/>
      Biomedical Peptides, Proteins &amp; Nucleic Acids 1:51-6 (1994).
      <br/>
      Increased efficiency was obtained, however, when the protecing group N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)-acetamide was used.
      <br/>
      The cyclic peptides made with the building block, which contain N-alkylamide bonds, were reported to be unstable under acidic conditions typical of solid phase peptide synthesis.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The synthesis of backbone cyclized peptides using glycine-based building blocks has also been reported by Zuckermann et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114: 10646-10647 (1994).
      <br/>
      This synthetic approach, which is limited to the solid phase preparation of N-substituted glycine oligomers consists of two steps: first, a resin bound secondary amine is alkylated; and second, a side-chain is introduced into the polypeptide by nucleophilic displacement of a halogen with an excess of a primary amine.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A more general method for the synthesis of backbone cyclized peptides is disclosed by Kaljuste et al.
      <br/>
      Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 43: 505-511 (1994).
      <br/>
      By utilizing amino acid aldehydes, this method allows the formation of branched building units on a solid support, but requires that both the backbone and the branching chain of the resulting cyclic peptide contain reduced peptide bonds.
      <br/>
      The method is further limited by synthetic and storage problems associated with amino acid aldehydes, the relatively slow rates of alkylation of the reduced peptide bonds formed during the reaction, and the residue formed from sequence-specific side reactions that can occur during the reductive alkylation of reduced peptide bonds.
      <br/>
      Additional purification and racemization problems are also reported.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As made clear above, methods of peptide backbone cyclization have been constrained by the limited variety of building blocks.
      <br/>
      For example, the use of similar building block protecting groups can form hydrophobic clusters along the side chains of a growing peptide which can reduce coupling rates, reaction efficiencies and yields.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, some protecting groups can cause the racemization of terminal amino acids during the synthesis of a cyclic peptide.
      <br/>
      A third drawback of many building blocks is that cyclic structures formed from them degrade under the acidic and/or basic conditions typical of solid phase synthetic methods.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      There thus exists a need for a larger variety of building units suitable for the synthesis of cyclic peptides, and a facile and efficient method of synthesizing such building units.
      <br/>
      There further exists a need for building units that are stable under solid phase synthetic conditions.

      The present invention encompasses building units that enable the backbone cyclization of peptides.
      <br/>
      Unlike those of the prior art, the building units of this invention typically comprise carboxyl and/or an amino groups sterically hindered only by a branching moiety.
      <br/>
      In this way, the slow coupling rates typical of prior art building blocks containing, for example, N-alkyl groups may be avoided.
      <br/>
      An additional advantage of the building units of this invention is that they are easily purified via conventional extraction, precipitation and flash chromatographic means.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the building units of the present invention are stable under both acidic and basic conditions, as well as in trimethylsilyl bromide solutions.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The branched peptide building units of the present invention are preferably formed by one of two methods: the acylation of N-aminoalkyl- or N-carboxyalkyl amino acids, or the acylation of protected pseudopeptides comprising reduced peptide bonds.
      <br/>
      In general, the individual procedures used to construct the branched peptide building units of this invention rely upon known principles of peptide synthesis, and upon solid phase peptide synthesis in particular.
      <br/>
      See, e.g., Bodanszky, Principles of Peptide Synthesis (Springer-Verlag: 1984); Bodanszky et al.

      <br/>
      Bioorg. Chem Vol. 8 (1979).
      <br/>
      For example, synthesis of the compounds of this invention may utilize coupling agents such as those listed above.
      <br/>
      More novel coupling agents, such as pre-formed urethane-protected N-carboxy anhydrides (UNCA's) and pre-formed acyl fluorides, may also be used.
      <br/>
      Coupling reactions may occur at room temperature or at elevated temperatures, and in solvents such as, but not limited to, those listed above.

    <p num="42">
      It will be appreciated that in order to achieve good yields of the compounds of this invention, it is generally necessary to protect reactive moieties during synthesis.
      <br/>
      Suitable protecting groups include those listed above, variations thereof, and additional groups known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, carboxylic acid end-groups may be protected by the formation of alkyl esters, substituted alkyl esters, thio esters, aryl or substituted aryl esters.
      <br/>
      As is well known to those skilled in the art, the selection of particular protecting groups used in a synthesis depends on a variety of factors, such as reaction conditions and whether or not other protecting groups are used at the same time.

      In the compounds of the present invention, AAm and AAp preferably designate residues of naturally occurring or synthetic proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids.

      Proteinogenic amino acid residues are those amino acids capable of forming proteins, and include Ala, Arg, Asn, Asp, Cys, Glu, Gln, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Pro, Ser, Thr, Tyr, Val, and derivatives thereof.
      <br/>
      Although these amino acids may exist in either their L-- or D-- configurations, the L-configuration is preferred.

      Additionally, non-proteinogenic amino acid residues may be incorporated into branched building units.
      <br/>
      Although these amino acid residues cannot form proteins on their own, their incorporation into a protein may, for example, aid in determining that protein's active conformers.
      <br/>
      Reporter groups such as fluorescent amino acids such as 5-hydroxytryptophan, dansyl-lysine, and their derivatives, photolabile amino acid residues, and isotopically labeled amino acids have been used for such purposes.

      The building units of Formula (II) are preferably branched dipeptides.

      <br/>
      A preferred embodiment of such an approach is shown in Scheme (II):  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)

    <p num="47">This approach reflects the inventors' discovery that benzyl and tertiary butyl protecting groups can form hydrophobic clusters that restrict the variety of solvents and reactants that may be used to form the building blocks of the present invention.</p>

      <br/>
      Preferably, however, the conditions are as follows: �A� represents reductive conditions suitable for the formation of a compound of Formula (b), and includes the use of, for example, (iso-Bu)2 AlH, LiAlH(O--But)3, LiAlH4 --EtOH, NaAlH4, and diaminoaluminum hydrides; �B� represents conditions suitable for the reductive alkylation of the compound of Formula (c), and includes the use of catalysts such as H2 /Ni, NaCNBH3, and Ag2 O for alkylation with BrCH2 COOBut ; �C� represents conditions suitable for the coupling of the compounds of Formulas (d) and (e), and includes the use of a coupling agent in the presence of bases such as collidine and DIEA; and �D� represents conditions suitable for the deprotection of the compound of Formula (f), and includes the use of an acid such as acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and sulfuric acid in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium acetate.

      The aldehyde of Formula (b) is preferably, but not necessarily, obtained via the reduction of an N-alkoxyamide.
      <br/>
      A preferred N-alkoxyamide is the N-methoxyamide of Formula (a):  (Chemical Structure image '8' not included in text)

      <br/>
      After much investigation, the present inventors have learned that the Alloc and OAll protecting groups are not readily reduced under such conditions, nor are they readily reduced during the following reductive alkylation reaction.

      Preferred protecting groups include OMe, OBzl, OFm, OAll, and OBut.
      <br/>
      This reaction is run under reaction conditions �B� that enable the formation of a compound of Formula (d):  (Chemical Structure image '9' not included in text)

    <p num="55">
      The reaction is preferably run in one of the above disclosed solvents, although DMF is most preferred, and a catalyst is used.

      Suitable catalysts are known to those skilled in the art and include, for example H2 /Ni, NaCNBH3, and Ag2 O in the case of BrCH2 COOBut.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the catalyst is NaCNBH3.
      <br/>
      After the catalyst is added, the solution is stirred until the reaction is complete; a duration of 24 hours at room temperature is typically sufficient.
      <br/>
      The protected N-alkylene amino acid product of Formula (d) is then isolated from the reaction mixture using conventional extraction techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="56">The N-alkylene amino acid product of Formula (d) is then coupled with a protected amino acid halide of Formula (e):  (Chemical Structure image '10' not included in text)</p>

      If Halides is Cl, it is preferred that the reaction conditions represented by �C� in Scheme (II) include the use of DCM as the solvent, and a base such as one of those disclosed above.
      <br/>
      It is preferred, however, that the reaction is performed in the presence of BTSA.
      <br/>
      If this combination is used, it is further preferred that BTSA is added to a solution of the N-alkylene amino acid Formula (d) at about room temperature over the course of about 24 hours.
      <br/>
      The solution is preferably then cooled to about 0 (degree)  C., at which point DIEA is added.
      <br/>
      At this time, the protected amino acid chloride of Formula (e) is added to the solution while the solution is stirred vigorously.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the protected amino acid chloride is added to the solution in five equal portions.
      <br/>
      Stirring is continued at about 0 (degree)  C. for about 1 hour, and continues after the solution temperature is raised to about room temperature for about another 24 hours or at least until some of the dipeptide building units having Formula (f) are formed.
      <br/>
      The branched dipeptide building unit may then deprotected prior to isolation and purification, simply isolated and purified, or isolated and purified and then deprotected to yield building blocks of the present invention.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that Formula (II) encompass both protected compounds of Formula (f) and deprotected compounds of Formula (g).
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      As indicated by Scheme (II), the compound of Formula (e) need not be a protected amino acid chloride.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the present inventors have learned that the N-terminal amino acid of the protected dipeptide of Formula (f) can be racemized when the reactant of Formula (e) is an acid chloride.
      <br/>
      The present inventors have also found, however, that this problem may be avoided if the compound of Formula (e) is a protected amino acid fluoride (i.e., Halides=F).
      <br/>
      Specifically, it has been discovered that dipeptides of Formula (f) may be obtained in good yield and with a minimum of racemization from the reaction of a Fmoc-AA-fluoride with an N-alkyl amino acid tertiary butyl ester.
      <br/>
      Without being limited by theory, this is believed to result from the enhanced stabilities of carboxylic acid fluorides as compared to their corresponding chlorides.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, because the N-alkyl amino acid ester of Formula (c) is more nucleophilic than the free carboxylic group, the fluoride compounds are activated to an extent sufficient to provide good coupling rates.
      <br/>
      Because different carboxylic acid halides react differently, the reaction conditions represented by �C� in Scheme (II) are preferably different than those described above for Halides=Cl.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The coupling reaction yields a protected dipeptide building block of Formula (f) which may be deprotected by conventional means.
      <br/>
      Specifically, reaction conditions represented by �D� in Scheme (II) include those that hydrolyze esters.
      <br/>
      For example, an organic acid such as acetic acid or a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid may be used in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium acetate to remove the protecting group Y.

    <p num="60">As described above, the building blocks of Formula (II) are preferably synthesized from N-aminoalkyl or N-carboxyalkyl amino acids of Formula (d):  (Chemical Structure image '11' not included in text)</p>

      <br/>
      The present inventors have unexpectedly found, however, that the simple extension of the alkyl chain from methyl to ethyl avoids this problem.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when Formula (d) represents a N-carboxyalkyl amino acid, it is preferred that it not be a N-carboxymethyl amino acid.

      It is more preferred that it be a N-carboxyethyl amino acid, which may be synthesized by means other than those shown in Scheme (II).

      Preferably, however, the conditions are as follows: �E� represents suitable conditions for coupling compounds of Formulas (t) and (u) for the formation of a compound of Formula (v), and includes conducting the reaction at 90 (degree)  C. for 3 hours; �F� represents conditions suitable for the rearrangement of the compound of Formula (v) to form the compound of Formula (w), and includes the use of (i) 2 N HCl, room temperature, 30 minutes, and (ii) NaCl; �G� represents conditions suitable for the synthesis of the compound of Formula (x), and includes dry toluene, at reflux, for 1.5 hours; and �H� represents conditions suitable for the coupling of the compounds of Formulas (x) and (c), and includes the use of (i) methanol, 0 (degree)  C., for 1 hour, and (ii) NaCNBH3.

      In another embodiment, the present invention encompasses peptide building units of Formula (III):

      X--AAm PSI (C ALPHA  H2 N)�CO(CH2)q --W�AAp --Y  (III)
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      These compounds differ from those of Formula (II) in that they contain a reduced peptide bond between adjacent AAm and AAp residues when m&gt;0, and an amide bond to the branching moiety.
      <br/>
      The reduced peptide bond is indicated by  PSI (C ALPHA  H2 N).
      <br/>
      Building units of Formula (III) allow more combinations of different protecting groups than those of Formula (II), yet exhibit similar stability in acidic and basic environments.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Although building units of Formula (III) may be synthesized by any means known to those skilled in the art, it is preferred that they be synthesized according to the method shown in Scheme (IV).
      <br/>
      Advantages of this method include high yields and limited formation of undesirable side-products such as dioxopiperazines.  (Chemical Structure image '13' not included in text)

    <p num="67">
      The approach shown in Scheme (IV) is based on an understanding of how aldehyde derivatives of natural and synthetic amino acids may be used to form dipeptides comprising reduced peptide bonds.
      <br/>
      This approach, like that shown for the first embodiment of the invention, is also based upon the inventors' discovery of novel ways by which aldehydes may be synthesized from protected amino acids, and from Fmoc-protected amino acids in particular.
      <br/>
      The synthesis of compounds of Formula (k) is thus preferably the same as that of Formula (b) shown in Scheme (II).

      The reaction conditions represented in part by �J�, �K� and �L� may be altered or changed in ways understood by those skilled in the art, and will vary depending upon the particular reactants used and whether the reactions are performed in the liquid or solid phase.

      Preferably, however, the conditions are as follows: �J� represents reductive conditions suitable for the formation of a compound of Formula (m), and includes the use of, for example, catalysts such as H2 /Ni, NaCNBH3, and Ag2 O in the case of BrCH2 COOBut ; �K� represents conditions suitable for the coupling of the compounds of Formulas (m) and (n), and includes the use of a coupling agent in combination with a base such as collidine and DIEA; and �L� represents conditions suitable for the deprotection of the compound of Formula (o), and includes the use of an acid such as acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, or sulfuric acid in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium acetate.

      Preferably, the reaction conditions represented by �J� include the use of a catalyst such as H2 /Ni, NaCNBH3, or Ag2 O in the case of BrCH2 COOBut, although other catalysts may of course be used.

Suitable coupling agents which may then be added include, for example, HBTU/ HOBT, HATU/HOBT, or alkyl chloroformates in combination with collidine and DIEA.
      <br/>
      After all the reactants have been combined, the resulting solution is preferably stirred for about one hour at 0 (degree)  C. and then overnight at room temperature or at least until branched peptides of Formula (o) are formed.

      The reaction product may be extracted from the solution using, for example, crystallization, precipitation, or flash chromatographic means.

      The building units of Formula (I), which encompasses those of Formulas (II) and (p), may be used in conventional solid phase peptide synthesis, and thus may be bound to other amino acids of an overall peptide structure.

      The invention is further defined by reference to the following nonlimiting examples.
      <br/>
      The compounds described in these examples were analyzed using a variety of techniques including thin layer chromatography (TLC), high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and fast atomic bombardment mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS).
      <br/>
      Thin layer chromatography was conducted using silica gel 60, F254, Merck 0.25 mm glass plates using the following solvent systems: S1 =hexane-ethyl acetate 1/1 v/v; S2 =chloroform-methanol 7/3 v/v; S3 =chloroform-methanol 9/1 v/v; S4 =chloroform-methanol-acetic acid 90/8/2 v/v/v; S5 =n-butanol-acetic acid-water 4/1/1 v/v/v; S6 =benzene-acetone-acetic acid 27/10/0.5 v/v/v. HPLC measurements utilized a Knauer Column (220 nm, HD-SIL-18-5s-80A, 250 * 4 mm) with a gradient that began from 20% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous TFA and progressed to 80% acetonitrile at a rate of 1% /min; a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used.
      <br/>
      These examples are representative, and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.

      H--Phe--OMe * HCl (2.16 g/ 10 mmol) was dissolved in 50 ml freshly distilled DMF.
      <br/>
      Tertiary butyl bromoacetate (2.44 g/ 12.5 mmol) and silver(I)oxide (5.79 g/ 25 mmol) were added under stirring at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Stirring was continued for 24 hours during which the color of the silver oxide changed from black to grey.
      <br/>
      The reaction process was monitored by TLC (system 1/ ninhydrine): the starting material H--Phe--OMe * HCl disappeared as a new, main spot was detected.
      <br/>
      After reaction completion, the mixture was filtered through a silica gel bed to remove the silver salts.
      <br/>
      The precipitate was washed with DMF (3 * 10 ml) and the filtrates were evaporated to dryness under vacuum.
      <br/>
      The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (50 ml) and extracted with 5% KHSO4 (3 * 10 ml), 10% NaHCO3 (3 * 10 ml) and saturated aqueous NaCl.
      <br/>
      After drying with anhydrous Na2 SO4 the solvent was removed under vacuum.
      <br/>
      The resulting oil (2.12 g/ 72% yield) was pure by TLC and HPLC.

      No H--Phe--OMe * HCl was detected (HPLC tR 5.10 min) and no diketopiperazine formation was observed.
