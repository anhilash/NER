      <br/>
      A temporary hand-held wheel spray mask (120) for detailing tires (112) to protect vehicle wheels (114) during chemical treatment of tires is a unitary thin plastic molded device having a generally circular opening for mating against the vehicle wheel and a generally domed or flattened concave body enclosure (128).
      <br/>
      The generally circular opening is defined as an annular flange (122) or a thin walled cylindrical section (126).
      <br/>
      This flange (122) or thin walled cylindrical section (126) is positioned against the outermost diameter of the face (116) of vehicle wheel; where the outermost diameter of the annular flange (122) or thin walled cylindrical section (126) closely matches the outermost diameter of the vehicle wheel (114), such that a plurality of unique and separate wheel spray masks (120) will be offered.
      <br/>
      While the wheel spray mask (120) is positioned against the wheel (114), light pressure is applied by the user to an integral or separately affixed handle (132) on the wheel spray mask.
      <br/>
      The generally domed or flattened concave body (128) will provide an overall masking function along with the annular (122) flange or thin walled cylindrical section (126) providing a barrier against overspray and direct liquid run-off.
      <br/>
      For added improved sealing protection, a seal or gasket (134) can be added to the face of the annular flange (122) or to the edge of the cylindrical section (126).

    <heading>BACKGROUND--FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to devices used in vehicle detailing.
      <br/>
      More particularly to devices used to mask or shield vehicle wheels and wheel covers while tire dressings, cleaners or other protectants are applied to the vehicle tire.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION--DISCUSSION OF PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="3">This invention relates generally to wheel protection and more particularly, to a device for protecting a vehicle wheel while it's tire is being chemically treated.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Trucks and cars represent a substantial investment by their respective owners.
      <br/>
      Often to enhance the appearance or otherwise personalize these vehicles, the owner may choose to order special factory wheels or purchase specialty after-market wheels from one of many wheel distributors.
      <br/>
      These specialty wheels can represent a financial outlay reaching into the thousands of dollars.
      <br/>
      Like purchasing a new suit, it is not complete without a set of matching polished shoes, or tires in this case.
      <br/>
      The selection of the tires are often as equally as important as the wheels.
      <br/>
      The tires and wheels together are viewed by the owner as a "matched set", in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      These vehicle owners then go about the ritual, often many times in the span of a week, of keeping the vehicles looking their best.
      <br/>
      Many products are available to aid in the washing and polishing of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Yet this job is not complete without much attention and labor being directed at the cleaning, polishing and otherwise enhancing the appearance of those tires and wheels.
      <br/>
      The vehicle owner can easily spend as much time on the wheels and tires as he does on the rest of the vehicle, largely due to the deep black luster and that he desires from those wheels and wheel covers.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Generally after the vehicle owner has spent a considerable amount of time and intense intricate labor caring for the wheel by cleaning and polishing, he then directs his attention towards the tires.
      <br/>
      Vehicle owners like to keep the their tires looking like new . . . even better than new� Many vehicles have whitewall tires, while others mount all-black tires.
      <br/>
      The white portions of the tires can become quite dirty with vehicle use, because of brake dust, dirt and road tar.
      <br/>
      The black portion of the new tires have a deep black luster which is difficult to maintain.
      <br/>
      There are many products out on the market to guard against oxidation and ultraviolet rays which tend to fade, harden and crack the side-walls of the tire and restore or improve that rich black luster of the tires.
      <br/>
      A high gloss deep black finish on the tire side-wall complements those custom wheels or even OEM wheels completes the ensemble.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Whether the owner is trying to protect the tire or trying to achieve that shine, or both, the chemicals needed are generally liquid and are purchased or applied in spray bottles.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to be able to apply these products to the tire with a spray dispenser, which helps ensure even coverage as well as offering a substantial time savings when compared to applying these products by hand using a towel and wiping the product onto the side-wall of the tire.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The problem with spraying the chemical protectants or the appearance enhancing solution is that extreme care must be taken not to allow any of the solution onto the finish of the wheel.
      <br/>
      This solution, upon drying or while still wet will leave smudges, that will dull the finish, attract more dirt and brake dust, and even do permanent damage by pitting the wheel's finish.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Devices have been developed to protect vehicle wheels during chemical tire treatment.
      <br/>
      Some of these are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,792,191; 4,784,440; 4,811,991; 4,874,206; 4,955,670; 5,524,972 and 5,785,389.

      While all of these devices are directed toward wheel protection while detailing tires, none have found commercial success.
      <br/>
      This may be due to the fact that they do not adequately mask and protect the wheel wheel cover or are unduly complex, are not engineered for a full range of wheel sizes, are bulky and cumbersome to be used easily, require assembly and some even pose risk to the user by instructing the user that a knife must be used to cut the part in order to achieve a desired size.

    <p num="18">
      A simple, low cost and effective product is needed on the market that will protect the wheel or wheel cover while the owner is applying these chemical protectants or appearance enhancing solutions to the tire side-wall.
      <br/>
      With the protection of the wheel or wheel cover while the owner is spraying or otherwise applying chemicals to the tire, the owner can quickly and easily complete this task in a just a few minutes, making the owner more likely to perform this task on a more regular basis.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">
      This hand-held vehicle wheel spray mask for tire detailing would be held against the vehicle wheel while a tire dressing or protectant is applied to the tire.
      <br/>
      This device is comprised of a generally concave shaped or generally cylindrical shaped enclosure device that approximately matches or is slightly greater than the vehicle wheel diameter.
      <br/>
      This device will sufficiently cover the vehicle wheel while providing adequate axial clearance with protrusions from the vehicle wheel such as knock-offs, hubs or the unique shape of the wheel itself.
      <br/>
      This vehicle wheel clearance feature of the enclosure would be defined as a generally flat or domed concave surface that is on the opposite end of the mask with respect to the interface with the vehicle wheel.
      <br/>
      Since such a mask by definition approximately matches the diameter of a given vehicle wheel, a series of predetermined unique and separate wheel masks are required to address the many sizes of vehicle wheels in the market.
    </p>
    <p num="20">This vehicle wheel spray mask for tire detailing could also be comprised of a flat disc that approximately matches the diameter of the vehicle wheel that would be sufficient for most OEM and many after-market vehicle wheels that do not have large axial protrusions from the wheel.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Without regard for the particular shape, the vehicle wheel spray mask for tire detailing would incorporate a handle, for gripping, maneuvering and holding the wheel mask in place against the vehicle wheel.
      <br/>
      This handle could be centrally located on the part, on the generally flat or domed concave surface that is on the opposite end of the part with respect to interface surface with the vehicle wheel.
      <br/>
      This handle could be attached, in the form of a separate piece, cut or formed integrally into the flat or domed concave surface, molded outwardly or inwardly from the base material of this flat surface or domed concave surface.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide a hand held device to mask and protect wheels during chemical treatment of a tire and tire sidewall that is mounted on a wheel, that is inexpensive, effective, easy to use, engineered to have unique and separate sizes for all wheel sizes.</p>
    <heading>OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES</heading>
    <p num="23">
      Accordingly, it is therefore an object of this invention to provide a hand held device to mask and protect wheels during chemical treatment of a tire and tire sidewall that is inexpensive, effective, simple to use, engineered to have unique and separate sizes for all wheel sizes and most importantly, a product that is offered to the public for sale at a reasonable cost.
      <br/>
      Several other objects and advantages of the present invention are:
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      a) to provide a vehicle wheel mask or shield that is lightweight and easy to hold in one hand with no other means necessary for holding it in place, freeing the other hand to apply the generally liquid protectants or tire dressing.
      <br/>
      b) to provide a vehicle wheel mask or shield that is durable and not subject to failure or loss of latching mechanisms.
      <br/>
      c) to provide a simple but reliable interface detail that will provide an adequate barrier against overspray, thus protecting the vehicle wheel or wheel cover.
      <br/>
      d) to provide a vehicle wheel mask that is simple to use, be cost efficient and most of all, be effective in masking the wheel or wheel cover.
      <br/>
      e) to provide a vehicle wheel mask that is completely ready for use by the end user, with no additional assembly or any other modification required.
      <br/>
      f) to provide a vehicle wheel mask that will make use of readily available recycled materials where possible; such as an ABS material incorporating reground materials.
      <br/>
      g) to provide a vehicle wheel mask that could incorporate a cushioned handle or grip for the comfort of the user.
      <br/>
      h) to provide a vehicle wheel mask that could incorporate a seal that could be added to the wheel mask at the wheel interface for additional protection of the vehicle wheel as well as to aid in the placement of the wheel mask against the wheel.
      <br/>
      The seal would not absorb any of the applied liquid products and could be simply wiped off before moving to the next tire if needed, eliminating the chance for inadvertent transfer of protectants dripping on the wheel.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Still further objects and advantages will become apparent from a consideration of the ensuing description and drawings.

    <p num="28">
      Referring now to FIG. 1 of the drawings, a vehicle 110 includes wheels, 114 and tires 112.
      <br/>
      These tires 112, are mounted on wheels 114 (only one visible).
      <br/>
      The vehicle owner or other user 115, illustrated crouching and spraying tire 112 with a chemical tire treatment liquid spray from container 117 held in operator's right hand.
      <br/>
      The wheel (not illustrated) which mounts tire 112 is shown being protected or masked by a protective wheel or wheel cover mask/shield 120 that is being held in place by the other hand of the operator.
      <br/>
      This wheel mask can be manufactured from one of many materials such as a single piece of plastic or injection molded plastics, aluminum sheet or aluminum die casting or thin sheet steel, wood and even cardboard for a more disposable version.

    <p num="29">
      A first preferred embodiment of the improved wheel spray mask of the present invention is schematically depicted in FIGS. 2-5. As shown in FIGS. 2 &amp; 3, wheel mask 120A covers wheel 114.
      <br/>
      This particular preferred embodiment is shown with two slots 130A cut or molded into a generally flat or domed concave enclosure surface 128A creating a center strip, a handle 132A for gripping by the operators hand.
      <br/>
      Other handles and methods for holding and placement of wheel spray mask 120A are illustrated in FIGS. 40-56.

      FIG. 4 is a 4 *  scale partial view of the upper portion of FIG. 3 Shown in both FIGS. 3 &amp; 4 is tire 112 and wheel 114 for better understanding of the interface between wheel mask 120A, circular flange 122A, tire 112 and wheel 114.
      <br/>
      Extending away from circular flange surface 122A, angle 140A that defines the shape of the generally concave domed body enclosure 120A and can vary, generally 90 (degree)  to 180 (degree)  or as needed for the body to clear axial protrusions from the wheel or wheel cover close to the area of flange surface 122A.
      <br/>
      This angle 140A would be pre-determined prior to the molding, stamping or fabrication process.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 3 &amp; 4, the diameter of flange 122A closely matches the outside diameter of face 116 of wheel 114.
      <br/>
      When circular flange 122A is placed against face 116 of wheel 114, a barrier to over-spray of liquids is created by having a light force P applied to the handle by the operator with his hand.
      <br/>
      Excess liquid from the application will drain into annular crevice 118 formed by tire 112 and wheel 114 and follow this annular crevice 118 downward around the diameter of wheel 114 towards ground 111, until it reaches a point where this excess liquid leaves annular crevice 118 and crosses the side wall of tire 112 and directly onto ground 111.
      <br/>
      Surface 128A is sufficiently spaced axially away from wheel 114 to clear protrusions extending axially away from wheel 114 such as knock-offs or wheel hubs that extend beyond the plane created by the outside diameter of wheel 114.

    <p num="63">Advantages</p>
    <p num="64">From the description above, a number of advantages of my vehicle wheel detailing mask become evident:</p>
    <p num="65">
      a) Its design allows for a maximum amount of the tire sidewall to be treated, while providing the needed protection for the vehicle wheel.
      <br/>
      b) It is appropriately sized for a specific vehicle wheel, with no assembly modification required.
      <br/>
      The operator simply chooses a specific size wheel mask for the particular size of wheels on the vehicle.
      <br/>
      c) It is made from a lightweight material, such as ABS or polystyrene.
      <br/>
      d) It can be manufactured from plastic with a significant portion of recycled or reclaimed composition.
      <br/>
      e) Using plastic for its manufacture also provides a material that will not scratch or damage the vehicle wheels.
      <br/>
      f) It's use provides for a great amount of time and labor savings while detailing tires, thus allowing the owner/operator the ability to detail the tires more frequently, thereby keeping those tires on those great looking wheels looking sharp�
    </p>
    <p num="66">Conclusion, Ramifications, and Scope</p>
    <p num="67">
      Accordingly, the reader will see that the hand held wheel spray mask can be used to quickly and effectively cover a vehicle wheel while a protectant or other tire dressing or cleaner is applied to the tire and its sidewall.
      <br/>
      In addition, the hand held wheel spray mask has been appropriately sized for each of the many wheel sizes, leaving the operator to simply picking up the wheel mask, gently pressing it against the wheel or tire, quickly applying the dressing and in a matter of seconds moving to the next tire, all without any overspray reaching the surface of the wheel.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Furthermore the hand held wheel mask has the additional advantages in that
      <br/>
      it is a self contained unit with no required assembly by the operator;
      <br/>
      it provides the integration of a simple yet effective gasket or seal if needed.;
      <br/>
      it is engineered such that one mask fits one wheel, no "one size fits all", without the need for any latching mechanism;
      <br/>
      it permits the production of wheel masks from a tough and durable plastic while providing a material that will not damage the wheel from abrasion or impact;
      <br/>
      it permits the production of wheel masks from recycled plastics
      <br/>
      it permits the use of many different colors of masks;

      <claim-text>and a generally domed concave hollow enclosure means attached in a contiguous manner to said thin walled cylindrical interface section, thereby enclosing said vehicle wheel or wheel cover and terminating at a predetermined spaced axial position from the face of said wheel to clear any protrusions from said wheel or wheel cover;</claim-text>
      <claim-text>and a grasping means on said mask for the operator's hand or fingers for the purpose of positioning and holding of said mask;</claim-text>
      <claim-text>and a sealing means whereby a gasket or seal is affixed to the edge surface of said thin walled cylindrical interface section of said mask for the purpose of acting as a barrier against the tire cleaners, tire dressing, protectants or paints for sealing the interface between said mask thin walled cylindrical interface edge surface and the tire sidewall concentrically outwardly adjacent to the outermost diameter of the vehicle wheel or wheel cover; whereby said thin walled cylindrical interface section of said mask with sealing means affixed to it's edge is positioned and held in place such that the edge of said thin walled cylindrical interface section with sealing means is pressed flush against the tire sidewall concentrically outwardly adjacent to said wheel or wheel cover at its outermost diameter with a light force applied by the operator's hand or fingers to said grasping means on said mask, thereby enclosing the wheel or wheel cover and creating a barrier at the wheel's outermost diameter;</claim-text>
      <claim-text>whereby said hollow enclosure means will prevent over spray or drips during the application of tire cleaners, tire dressings, protectants or paints onto the tire or tire sidewall from being applied to the vehicle wheel.</claim-text>
