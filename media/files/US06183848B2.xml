      An amorphous copolyester having a maximum melt viscosity at 1 radian/second and at about 260 to about 290° C. of about 12000 poise, a glass transition temperature ranging from about 88° C. to about 120° C., and an inherent viscosity of at least about 0.6 dl/g.
      <br/>
      The amorphous copolyesters comprise the reaction product of a diol component and a dicarboxylic acid component.
      <br/>
      The diol component comprises residues of from about 5.0 to about 50 mole % of 2,2'-(sulfonylbis (4,1-phenyleneoxy))-bis(ethanol) which has the following chemical formula:and from about 50 to about 95 mole % of a mixture of at least two diols selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, and mixture thereof.
      <br/>
      The dicarboxylic acid component comprises residues of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, 1,4-cyclohexandedicarboxylic acid, 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      The amorphous copolyesters according to the invention have relatively low melt viscosities and relatively high glass transition temperatures.
      <br/>
      Because of the low melt viscosities and high glass transition temperatures, copolyesters with increased IV or molecular weight can easily be obtained.
      <br/>
      The copolyesters according to the invention can be used for molded or extruded articles, sheets, and films.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the invention also relates to molded and extruded articles, sheets, and films made from a copolyester as described above.
      <br/>
      Additionally, articles, sheets, and films according to the invention have improved gas barrier properties such that they may be used for packaging perishable goods, such as beverages, foods and cosmetics, as well as other oxygen sensitive products such as inks and adhesives.

    <p num="5">
      The invention relates to amorphous copolyesters containing 2,2'-(sulfonylbis(4,1-phenyleneoxy))bis(ethanol).
      <br/>
      The amorphous copolyesters exhibit enhanced heat distortion temperatures and glass transition temperatures without a significant increase in viscosity at low shear rates.
      <br/>
      The amorphous copolyesters also have improved oxygen barrier properties and are readily molded and extruded to form containers and films useful for packaging perishable goods and other oxygen sensitive products such as inks and adhesives.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      Amorphous copolyesters are generally defined as copolyesters that do not show a substantial melting point by differential scanning calorimetry when scanned at a rate of 20 C./min. These copolyesters are typically based on terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol.
      <br/>
      It is generally known in the art that amorphous copolyesters possess a combination of desirable properties, such as excellent clarity and color, toughness, chemical resistance and ease of processing.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, such copolyesters are known to be useful for the manufacture of extruded sheets, packaging materials, and parts for medical devices.
      <br/>
      However, when compared to other families of materials such as polycarbonates based on bisphenol A and certain acrylic resins like polymethyl methacrylate, amorphous copolyesters generally have lower glass transition temperatures (Tg) and lower heat distortion temperatures (HDT).
      <br/>
      The lower Tg and HDT of amorphous polyesters inhibit their application where resistance to thermal deformation is important, for example, green house panels, skylights and other products prepared by extrusion or injection molding processes.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      It is also important that amorphous copolyesters have a low shear melt viscosity.
      <br/>
      Unlike semi-crystalline polyesters, where ultimate molecular weight values can be raised by polymerization in the crystalline or solid state, high molecular weight amorphous copolyesters must be obtained directly in the melt phase polymerization.
      <br/>
      It is not possible or it is too expensive to render the amorphous copolyesters into a crystalline pellet or particle form.
      <br/>
      Further, when heated to the temperatures required for solid state polymerization, amorphous pellets or particles flow together and stick together.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) are valuable commercial semicrystalline polyesters, which are widely used for packaging materials due to the combination of desirable properties that these resins possess.
      <br/>
      The high oxygen barrier properties of these polyesters renders them particularly valuable for packaging oxygen sensitive food and other goods and materials.
      <br/>
      PEN has advantages over PET due to its higher Tg and higher oxygen barrier properties.
      <br/>
      PEN, however, is somewhat harder to process than PET, which is a disadvantage to its use.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Crystallization modifiers like isophthalic acid (IPA) and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) are often copolymerized into PET and PEN polyesters to form copolyesters that have better processing properties.
      <br/>
      Modest levels of IPA slow down crystallization and raise the oxygen barrier properties.
      <br/>
      Higher levels of IPA break up crystallinity and lead to amorphous copolyesters with good barrier properties, but these copolyesters, are known to those familiar with the art, to possess poor impact and other mechanical properties.
      <br/>
      On the other hand modest levels of CHDM slow down crystallization, but decrease oxygen barrier properties.
      <br/>
      Higher levels of CHDM are well known to form families of amorphous copolyesters, which are widely used in commerce in a multitude of applications including heavy gauge sheet, signage, medical packages, etc.
      <br/>
      These copolyesters have excellent impact resistance and other mechanical properties, but have lower oxygen barrier properties than IPA modified copolyesters and lower oxygen barrier properties than PET.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Accordingly, there is a need for amorphous copolyesters having sufficiently low shear melt viscosities allowing the copolyesters to flow through the reactor at a practical rate allowing the copolyesters to build to a useful molecular weight.
      <br/>
      It is known in the art that the molecular weight of copolyesters can be conveniently measured in terms of its inherent viscosity ("IV").
      <br/>
      Generally, an IV of 0.65 or higher is necessary for useful mechanical properties.
      <br/>
      Further, the maximum melt viscosity at 1 radian/second (shear rate) generally ranges from about 10,000 poise to about 12,000 poise at the temperature of the melt phase polymerization which is commonly in the range of about 260 to about 290 C. There is an unmet need in commerce for amorphous copolyesters with high Tg that also have good mechanical properties with good oxygen barrier properties.

      <br/>
      The invention answers this need.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="20">
      It has been discovered that when the diol component of an amorphous copolyester comprises residues of from about 5 to about 50 mole % of a 2,2'-(sulfonylbis (4,1-phenyleneoxy))-bis(ethanol), the melt viscosities and glass transition temperatures of such copolyesters are improved.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the invention relates to an amorphous copolyester having a maximum melt viscosity at 1 radian/second and at about 260 to about 290 C. of about 12,000 poise; a glass transition temperature ranging from about 88 C. to about 120 C.; and an inherent viscosity of at least about 0.6. Such amorphous copolyesters comprise the reaction product of a diol component and a dicarboxylic acid component.
      <br/>
      The diol component comprises residues of from about 5 to about 50 mole % of 2,2'-(sulfonylbis (4,1-phenyleneoxy))-bis(ethanol) and from about 50 to about 95 mole % of a mixture of at least two diols selected from ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, and mixtures thereof, wherein the total diol component is based on 100 mole %. The dicarboxylic acid component of the copolyesters according to the invention comprises residues of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, and mixtures thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Because the copolyesters according to the invention surprisingly have relatively low melt viscosities at low shear rates, they can be readily prepared in conventional low-shear melt phase polyester manufacturing equipment.
      <br/>
      Further, due to the low melt viscosities the IV or molecular weight of the copolyesters according to the invention is easily increased to yield copolyesters with useful mechanical properties, i.e., toughness.
      <br/>
      In addition, because the copolyesters of the invention have relatively high glass transition temperatures and heat distortion temperatures, they can be used to prepare molded or extruded articles and sheets.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the invention also relates to molded and extruded articles, sheets, and films made from a copolyester as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      It has also been discovered that when the diol component of an amorphous copolyester comprises residues of from about 5 to about 50 mole % of a 2,2'-(sulfonylbis (4,1-phenyleneoxy))- bis(ethanol), the gas permeability of the copolyester is lowered when compared to amporphous copolyesters comprising residues of 1,4-cyclohexanedimenthanol or neopentyl glycol as the sole diol component.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in another embodiment the invention relates to molded articles, sheets, and films having an oxygen permeability rate of less than 40.0 cc-mils/100 in 2 -24 hrs-atm prepared from the amorphous copolyester described above.

      Additional objects and advantages of the invention are discussed in the detailed description which follows, and will be obvious from that description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that both this summary and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not intended to restrict the invention in any way.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="24">The invention relates to an amorphous copolyester having a maximum melt viscosity at 1 radian/second (shear rate) and at about 260 to about 290 C. of about 12,000 poise; a glass transition temperature ranging from about 88 C. to about 120 C.; and an inherent viscosity of at least about 0.6. As part of its diol component, the amorphous copolyesters comprise residues of 2,2'-(sulfonylbis (4,1-phenyleneoxy))bis(ethanol) ("BDS") which has the following chemical formula:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="25">
      The presence of BDS provides the copolyester with enhanced glass transition temperatures and heat distortion temperatures while surprisingly maintaining the relatively low shear rate melt viscosities of commercial amorphous copolyesters.
      <br/>
      The amorphous copolyesters of the invention are the reaction product of a diol component and a dicarboxylic acid component, as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The diol component comprises residues of from about 5 to about 50 mole %, more preferably from about 10 to about 50 mole %, of BDS and about 50 to 95 mole %, more preferably from about 50 to about 90 mole %, of a mixture of at least two diols selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the diol component comprises residues of from about 10 to about 50 mole % BDS and from about 50 to about 90 mole % of a mixture at least two diols selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, cyclohexanedimethanol, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      While the mole ratio of the diols in the mixture of at least two diols may vary as long as the desired properties discussed above are achieved, the minimum amount of any particular diol should be at least 1 mole %.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The mole % of each diol, including BDS and the diols from the mixture of at least two diols in the diol component adds up to a total of 100 mole %. For example, when the diol component contains BDS and a mixture of two other diols (as discussed above), the diol component of the amorphous copolyester of the invention can easily be represented by the following formula:
      <br/>
      (X)+(Y)+(Z)
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In the formula, X is the mole % of BDS which ranges from 5 to 50, as discussed above.
      <br/>
      Where the mixture of at least two diols in the amorphous copolyester contains only two diols, Y and Z represent the mole % of the two diols and range from 50 to 95 mole %. In such a preferred embodiment, the mole ratio of Y to Z may vary widely as long as an amorphous copolyester with the desired properties is achieved.
      <br/>
      Generally, for example, the mole ratio of Y to Z ranges from 1:94 to 1:1.
      <br/>
      For example, as illustrated by the examples below, the mole ratio of Y to Z can range from 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:6, and 1:7.
      <br/>
      In embodiments where the mixture of at least two diols is a mixture of three or more diols, similar ranges of mole ratios may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The dicarboxylic acid component comprises residues of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, or mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Also suitable are the anhydrides thereof, acid chlorides thereof, and lower, e.g., C1 -C8 alkyl esters thereof.
      <br/>
      Any isomers of the dicarboxylic acid component or mixtures thereof may be used.
      <br/>
      For example, cis, trans, or cis/trans mixtures of 1,4-cyclohexenedicarboxylic acid may be employed.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable naphthalenedicarboxylic acid isomers include 1,4-naphthalenedic arboxylic acid, 2-6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 2,7-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid or mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the dicarboxylic acid component is terephthalic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As discussed above, the amorphous copolyesters according to the invention have enhanced glass transition and heat distortion temperatures and exhibit improved resistance to thermal deformation in applications where heat is generated.
      <br/>
      In this regard, the glass transition temperature of the copolyesters of the invention range from about 88 C. to about 120 C., more preferably from about 90 to about 110 C., as determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) at a heating rate of 20 C./min, generally to a temperature of 280-300 C., in a nitrogen atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Further, amorphous copolyesters according to the invention have a maximum melt viscosity at 1 radian/second (shear rate) and at about 260 to about 290 C. of about 12,000 poise as determined by a temperature drop experiment from 290 to 120 C. with a 10 degree interval on a Rheometrics Dynamic Analyzer (RDA II) with 25 mm diameter parallel plates.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the amorphous copolyester of the invention has a melt viscosity ranging from about 3000 poise to about 11,000 poise, most preferably from about 4000 to about 10,000 poise.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As discussed above, the presence of BDS in the copolyester of the invention significantly increases the glass transition temperature and the heat distortion temperature.
      <br/>
      Further, it has surprisingly been discovered that the low shear rate melt viscosity of the copolyesters of the invention are not increased over that of lower glass transition temperature commercial amorphous copolyesters that do not contain BDS.
      <br/>
      Due to the low melt viscosity of the copolyester of the invention, its molecular weight (measured as IV) is advantageously increased yielding copolyesters with enhanced mechanical properties, i.e., toughness.
      <br/>
      Generally, the copolyesters of the invention have an IV of at least about 0.6 measured at a temperature of 25 C. at 0.25 g/dl concentration in a solvent mixture of symmetric tetrachloroethane and phenol having a weight ratio of symmetric tetrachloroethane to phenol of 2:3.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the IV ranges from about 0.65 to about 0.90 dl/g, more preferably, from about 0.70 to about 0.80.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The amorphous copolyesters according to the invention are prepared by conventional polymerization processes known in the art, such as disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,093,603 and 5,681,918, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      Examples of polycondensation processes useful in the present invention include melt phase processes conducted with the introduction of an inert gas stream, such as nitrogen, to shift the equilibrium and advance to high molecular weight or the more conventional vacuum melt phase polycondensations, at temperatures ranging from about 240 C. to about 300 C. or higher which are practiced commercially.
      <br/>
      Although not required, conventional additives may be added to the copolyesters of the invention in typical amounts.
      <br/>
      Such additives include pigments, colorants, stabilizers, antioxidants, extrusion aids, slip agents, carbon black, flame retardants and mixtures thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Typical preparations of the amorphous copolyesters of the invention are shown in the examples below.</p>
    <p num="35">
      As discussed, it may be preferable to conduct the polymerization reaction in the presence of one or more conventional polymerization catalysts.
      <br/>
      Typical catalysts or catalyst systems for polyester condensation are well-known in the art.
      <br/>
      Suitable catalysts are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,025,492, 4,136,089, 4,176,224, 4,238,593, and 4,208,527, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      Further, R. E. Wilfong, Journal of Polymer Science, 54, 385 (1961), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, describes typical catalysts which are useful in polyester condensation reactions.
      <br/>
      Preferred catalyst systems include Mn/Ti/Co/P, Mn/Ti/P, Zn/Ti/Co/P, Zn/Al.
      <br/>
      When cobalt is not used in the polycondensation, the use of polymerizable toners are required to control the color of these amorphous copolyesters so that they are suitable for the intended applications where color may be an important property.
      <br/>
      In addition to the catalysts and toners other additives, such as antioxidants, dyes, etc. may be used in the copolyesterifications.

      Due to the relatively high glass transition temperature and heat distortion temperature of the copolyesters according to the invention, the copolyesters are extremely useful for applications in extruded heavy gauge sheet, extruded film and other plastic applications.
      <br/>
      Common plastic processing techniques such as compression molding, injection molding, and extrusion can be successfully used to manufacture useful articles from these copolyesters.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, another embodiment of the invention relates to articles, sheets, and films prepared from the copolyester composition described above.
      <br/>
      Depending on the catalyst system used and the polycondensation process conditions, the articles, sheets, and films according to the invention can be transparent, preferably having an L* color value of at least about 70, an a* value ranging from about (-)1.5 to 1.5 and a b* value ranging from about (-)1.5 to 1.5.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Generally, a copolyester of the invention is shaped into an unoriented, low crystallinity, transparent sheet by drying the resin, extruding the resulting resin into a sheet using, for example, inflation or pressing techniques or an extruder fitted with an appropriately configured sheet-forming die, for example, a T-die extruder.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the sheet has a thickness ranging from about 5 mil to about 40 mil.
      <br/>
      The sheet is then contacted with a casting drum, such as chill roll, set at a sufficiently low temperature to thereby quench and solidify the sheet.
      <br/>
      The resulting sheet may then be thermally formed into a container having a desired shape by conventional thermoforming processes known in the art, including but not limited to, vacuum forming and pressure forming processes.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In another embodiment, the quenched sheet may be oriented minimally either monoaxially or biaxially by techniques known in the art.
      <br/>
      For biaxial extension, for example, the longitudinal and lateral extensions may be conducted at a temperature ranging from about 60 C. to about 150 C. in a draw ratio of about 2.5 to about 6.0 using, for example, a T. M. Long stretching apparatus.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the draw ratio in both longitudinal and lateral directions ranges from about 2.5 to about 4 0 (slashed zero)  A biaxially extended film according to the invention generally has a thickness ranging from about 0.2 mil to about 2.5 mil, more preferably from about 0.5 mil to about 1.0 mil.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Sheeting made from clear, colored, or pigmented copolyesters of this invention can be advantageously employed in a great number of applications where the enhanced resistance to thermal deformation or flow provided by these copolyesters is important.
      <br/>
      Such examples include, but are not limited to skylights, solar roof panels, sign boards, greenhouse panels, marquees on stores, etc.
      <br/>
      The copolyesters of the invention may be used as a single sheet or as coextruded sheets in these kinds of applications with UV protection or color layers contiguous to the enhanced Tg copolyester layer.
      <br/>
      The higher heat distortion temperatures of the amorphous copolyesters of the invention are also useful in medical plastic area with improved sterilization performance and improved chemical resistance.

    <p num="40">
      The films and containers according to the invention have unexpected low permeability to gases, such as, oxygen and carbon dioxide, and improved glass transition temperatures.
      <br/>
      Thus, the bottles, containers and films of this invention provide increased shelf storage life for contents, including perishable goods such as beverages, foods, and cosmetics that are sensitive to the permeation of gases, as well as oxygen sensitive products such as inks and adhesives.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the oxygen permeability rate of films and containers according to the invention is less than about 40.0 cc-mils/100 in2-24 hrs-atm.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the oxygen permeability rate is less about 35, more preferably less than about 20, and even more preferably less than about 15 cc and most preferably less than about 10 mils/100 in2-24 hrs-atm.
      <br/>
      The oxygen permeability rate can be determined on film and containers using, for example, ASTM standard D3985.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF RESULTS</heading>
    <p num="78">
      Table 2 shows the oxygen permeability data for the various polyester compositions of Examples 9-14.
      <br/>
      An inspection of this table shows that BDS maintains barrier in copolyester compositions in contrast to 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol which lowers barrier or increases the oxygen permeability.
      <br/>
      For example the polyethylene terephthalate control sample has an oxygen permeability of 14.8. This is compared to PETG 6763, which contains a mixture of ethylene glycol (ca. 70%) and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (ca. 30%), which has an oxygen permeability of 26.3. When ca. 20% of the 1,4-cyclohexane-dimethanol is removed and replaced with BDS, the oxygen permeability decreases to 17.8. The direct substitution of 30% BDS for ethylene glycol yields a film with oxygen permeability the same as PET.
      <br/>
      These data are surprising and show that BDS enhances Tg of the polyester chain without negatively impacting the permeability performance.
