    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention generally relates to techniques for transferring genes into mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      The method provides a method for transfecting cells with high efficiency and low cellular toxicity.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Despite the great promise of gene therapy, there remains to be solved the challenging problem of efficiently transferring and stably expressing transgenes in appropriate tissues.
      <br/>
      This problem has recently been termed the "vector void" (Hodgson, C P. Bio/Technol. 1995;13:222-225).
      <br/>
      After the description of DOTMA (N-�1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl�-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride) (Felgner, P L, Gadek, T R, Holm, M, et al.
      <br/>
      Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987;84:74137417), a plethora of cationic lipids have been synthesized.
      <br/>
      Basically, all the cationic lipids are amphipathic compounds that contain a hydrophobic domain, a spacer, and positively-charged amine(s).
      <br/>
      The cationic lipids are mixed with a fusogenic lipid such as DOPE (dioleoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine) to form liposomes.
      <br/>
      The cationic liposomes are then mixed with plasmid DNA and the binary complex of the DNA and liposomes are then applied to cells in a tissue culture dish.
      <br/>
      The ease of mixing the plasmid DNA with the cationic liposome formulation, the ability of the cationic lipids to complex with DNA and the relative high levels of transfection efficiency has led to he increasing use of these formulations.
      <br/>
      However, these cationic lipid formulations can also be toxic to the cells in culture (Gao, X and Huang, L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1991;179:280-285) (Leventis, R and Silvius, J R. Biochim. et Biophys.
      <br/>
      Acta 1990;1023:124-132).
      <br/>
      Although, LipofectAMINE can transfect many cell types more efficiently than other types of cationic lipid formulations (Harms, J S and Splitter, G A. Focus 1994;17:34-35), it also has greater toxicity (Hawley-Nelson, P, Ciccarone, V and Jessee, J. Focus 1993;15:73-79) (Ciccarone, V, Hawley-Nelson, P and Jessee, J. Focus 1993;15:80-83).
      <br/>
      If the transfection method is toxic to cells, then this would reduce its applicability for gene therapy.
      <br/>
      Cellular toxicity would also reduce its applicability to the study of genes since the cells would be in an altered state and it may be difficult to differentiate an effect of the transfection reagent from expression of the foreign gene.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Accordingly, there is a need for a means of transfecting cells with great efficiency and little toxicity.
      <br/>
      In addition, given the vector void for gene therapy, there is a need for new types of methods to transfer genes into mammalian cells.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      The present invention provides an enhancement of gene transfer into cells using a ternary complex of DNA, amphipathic compounds, and a DNA-binding protein.
      <br/>
      Cultured cells exposed to these ternary complexes expressed foreign genes at very high levels and with minimal cellular toxicity.
      <br/>
      Further, the use of a DNA-binding protein and novel amphipathic compounds together increased gene transfer efficiency by several orders of magnitude.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In one aspect, the present invention provides a process of transfecting a cell with DNA comprising exposing the cell to the DNA mixed with amphipathic compounds and an effective amount of a DNA-binding protein.</p>
    <p num="7">
      A preferred DNA-binding protein is a histone such as H1, H2A, or H2B.
      <br/>
      Natural DNA binding proteins such as histone also have several advantages over polycationic compounds such as polylysine.
      <br/>
      Human H1 histone protein is not immunogenic and does not induce anaphylaxis.
      <br/>
      Polylysine induces anaphylactic shock and is very immunogenic.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In one preferred embodiment, the DNA-binding protein is linked to a nuclear localization signal.
      <br/>
      A recombinant histone (NLS-H1) containing both the SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal and the C-terminal domain of human histone H1 was produced in bacteria.
      <br/>
      NIH3T3 or COS-7 cells transfected with NLS-H1 plasmid DNA-Lipofectin complexes expressed at least 20 times more liuciferase or had at least 2.5 times more B-galactosidase positive cells than those transfected with plasmid DNA-lipofectin complexes alone.
      <br/>
      Foreign gene expression was also improved by other DNA-binding proteins and cationic lipid formulations, but the greatest enhancement in foreign gene expression was obtained with complexes containing either NLS-H1 or calf-thymus histone H1.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A variety of amphipathic compounds can be used in conjunction with a DNA binding protein such as histone protein to mediate the transfer of the plasmid DNA into the cell.
      <br/>
      A preferred embodiment is amphipathic compounds that are cationic.
      <br/>
      The cationic amphipathic compound can be a non-natural polyamine wherein one or more of the amines is bound to at least one hydrophobic moiety wherein the hyudrophobic moiety comprises a C6-C24 alkane, C6-C24 alkene, sterol, steroid, lipid, fatty acid or hydrophobic hormone.
      <br/>
      The amphipathic compounds may or may not form liposomes.
      <br/>
      Several novel amphipathic cationic compounds are described.
      <br/>
      These include compounds with the following structures:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)   (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In contrast to the use of previously described cationic liposomes, most of the novel amphipathic cationic compounds described above do not efficiently mediate the transfer of genes into cells when used alone.
      <br/>
      However, the use of histone proteins with these novel amphipathic cationic compounds enable the efficient gene transfer into a variety of mammalian cells with minimal cellular toxicity.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the use of histone proteins expands the range and types of cationic lipids that can be used for gene transfer.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Histone H1-plasmid DNA-cationic lipid complexes showed less cytotoxicity and were internalized by a greater number of cells than plasmid DNA-cationic lipid complexes.
      <br/>
      Thus, histone binding to plasmid DNA prior to the addition of cationic amphipathic compounds improved cellular uptake and transient foreign gene expression while reducing the cellular toxicity associated with cationic-lipid mediated gene transfer.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The present invention includes a process of transfecting a polynucleotide into a cell for expression by associating a selected cell with an amphipathic compound, an effective amount of a polynucleotide-binding protein and a selected polynucleotide, in solution.
      <br/>
      The term "transfecting" means that a polynucleotide becomes associated with a selected cell.
      <br/>
      The polynucleotide can be on the membrane of the cell or inside the cytoplasm, nucleus, or other organeile of the cell.
      <br/>
      Other terms sometimes used interchangeably with transfecting include "delivering" or "transferring" to a cell and "transforming" a cell.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The polynucleotide is delivered to the cell by associating the cell with one or more amphipathic compounds along with a polynucleotide-binding protein in a solution.
      <br/>
      The term "associating" means to put in communication with or to place in close proximity.
      <br/>
      The term "polynucleotide" is a term of art that refers to a string of at least two base-sugar-phosphate combinations.
      <br/>
      Nucleotides are the monomeric units of nucleic acid polymers.
      <br/>
      The term includes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the form of an oligonucleotide, messenger RNA, anti-sense, plasmid DNA, parts of a plasmid DNA or genetic material derived from a virus.
      <br/>
      The selected cell can be a mammalian cell that is within the tissue in situ; the cell could also be removed and maintained in tissue culture in a primary, secondary, immortalized or transformed state.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The amphipathic compound is a linear molecule with a polar first end causing that end to be hydrophilic (water-soluble); the second end is nonpolar and therefore hydrophobic (water-insoluble).
      <br/>
      The amphipathic compound can be cationic or incoporated into a liposome that is cationic or anionic.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the amphipathic compound is a non-natural polyamine. "Non-natural", in this application, means that, for example, the compound is not found in living matter.
      <br/>
      As contrasted with "natural" which in this application refers to a compound that is derived from animal or plant tissue directly or by recombinant means.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The polynucleotide-binding protein is a protein that can be used in an effective amount in its natural form or modified for this process.
      <br/>
      An "effective amount" of the polynucleotide-binding protein is an amount that will allow transfection to occur.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the polynucleotide-binding protein is a DNA-binding protein which is isolated from an animal tissue, such as calf thymus or produced in recombinant form from E. coli.
      <br/>
      The DNA-binding protein associates with DNA under conditions described in this application and forms a complex with DNA having a high binding constant.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the DNA-binding protein is cationic (net positive charge) such as a histone protein.
      <br/>
      H1 histone protein is the preferred histone type.
      <br/>
      In yet another preferred embodiment, histone H1 protein is used as a DNA-binding protein and one of the compounds -4, -11, -16, -17, -20, -21, -23, -30, and -32 is used for the amphipathic compound in the form of liposomes.
      <br/>
      This invention is of particular use for the delivery of a polynucleotide when one wants to study the polynucleotide's effect on a cell.
      <br/>
      The polynucleotide could also be used to produce a change in a cell that can be therapeutic.
      <br/>
      This change can be effected when the cell is transplanted back into the animal or person.
      <br/>
      The delivered polynucleotide could also produce a therapeutic protein or RNA that is then delivered to the animal or person apart from the cell.
      <br/>
      Transfections are also done to produce viruses or viral vectors that are studied or used for therapeutic, gene therapy purposes.
      <br/>
      The delivery of polynucleotides or genetic material for therapeutic purposes is commonly called "gene therapy".
    </p>
    <p num="16">1. Preparation of Cells</p>
    <p num="17">
      The cell can be a mammalian cell that is maintained in tissue culture such as cell lines that are immortalized or transformed.
      <br/>
      These include a number of cell lines that can be obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (Bethesda) such as 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, Rat1 rat fibroblasts, CV-1 monkey kidney cells, COS (monkey kidney) cells, 293, HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells, or HepG2 (human) hepatocytes.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The mammalian cell can be primary or secondary which means that it has been maintained in culture for a relatively short time after being obtained from an animal tissue.
      <br/>
      These include primary liver cells or primary muscle cells.
      <br/>
      The cells within the tissue are separated by mincing and digestion with enzymes such as trypsin or collagenases that destroy the extracellular matrix.
      <br/>
      Tissues consist of several different cell types and purifications methods such as gradient centrifugation or antibody sorting can be used to obtain purified amounts of the preferred cell type.
      <br/>
      For example, primary myoblasts are separated from contaminating fibroblasts using Percoll (Sigma) gradient centrifugation.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Both the primary cells and cell lines are grown (cultured) in tissue culture media such as Dulbeco's Modified MEM media (D-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah) for the 3T3 and HepG2 cells.
      <br/>
      The cultures are maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 degrees C. The cells are seeded in 6-well plates (35 mm-in diameter culture dishes) 24 h before the transfection at 40-60% confluence.
    </p>
    <p num="20">2. Preparation of Polynucleotides</p>
    <p num="21">
      The polynucleotide can be a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the form of an oligonucleotide, anti-sense, plasmid DNA, parts of a plasmid DNA or genetic material derived from a virus.
      <br/>
      The polynucleotide can also be a ribonucleic acid (RNA).
      <br/>
      The RNA can be produced using synthetic chemical techniques (RNA in the form of an oligonucleotide) or biochemically using a RNA polymerase such T7 RNA polymerase (G1) and a DNA template containing the cognate T7 promoter (Deng, H and Wolff, J A. Self-amplifying expression from the T7 promoter in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts.
      <br/>
      Gene 1994;143:245-249).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In one preferred embodiment, the exogenous genetic construction is a plasmid DNA that consists of DNA from another organism, of the same or different species.
      <br/>
      The plasmid DNA constructions normally include a coding sequence for a transcription product or a protein of interest, together with flanking regulatory sequences effective to cause the expression of the protein in the transfected cells.
      <br/>
      Examples of flanking regulatory sequences are a promoter sequence sufficient to initiate transcription and a terminator sequence sufficient to terminate the gene product, by termination of transcription or translation.
      <br/>
      Suitable transcriptional or translational enhancers can be included in the exogenous gene construct to further assist the efficiency of the overall transfection process and expression of the protein in the transfected cells.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A marker or reporter gene encodes a gene product which can be easily assayed, such as a the firefly luciferase.
      <br/>
      The presence of the product of the marker gene indicates that the cell is transfected and the amount of the product indicates how efficient the transfection process.
      <br/>
      The firefly luciferase reporter gene was used in most of our studies to determine the efficiency of DNA transfer quantitatively.
      <br/>
      The previously described, plasmid DNA pBS.CMVLux was used to express the firefly luciferase reporter gene from the Cytomegalovirus (CMV) LTR promoter (Danko, I., Fritz, J. D., Jiao, S., Hogan, K., Latendresse, J. L., and Wolff, J. A. Gene Therapy Pharmacological enhancement of in vivo foreign gene expression in muscle, volume 1, pp. 114-121, 1994; incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      The plasmid also contains the SV40 intron and poly A addition signals for proper and efficient  PI .
      <br/>
      RNA processing.
      <br/>
      All plasmids were purified by alkaline lysis and then two cesium chloride gradients as previously described (Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989) in Molecular Cloning Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; Jiao, S., Williams, P., Beg, R. K., Hodgeman, B. A., Liu, L., Repetto, G., and Wolff, J. A. (1992) Hum. Gene Ther. 3, 21-33; incorporated herein by reference).
    </p>
    <p num="24">3. Preparation of Transfection Complexes</p>
    <p num="25">
      The transfection complexes are prepared by adding the polynucleotide by mixing the said polynucleotide with one or more amphipathic compounds and an effective amount of a polynucleotide binding protein.
      <br/>
      By"mixing" we mean putting together in a solution of water or a water-miscible solvent such as ethanol in small amounts that is not toxic to cells (Campbell, M J. Lipofection reagents prepared by a simple ethanol injection technique.
      <br/>
      BioTechniques 1995;18:1027-1032; incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, the polynucleotide is mixed first with the DNA-binding protein in serum-free media and then the amphipathic compound is added to the mixture containing the polynucleotide and DNA-binding protein.
      <br/>
      The mixture containing the ternary complex of polynucletide, DNA-binding protein and amphipathic compound is then added to the cells.
    </p>
    <p num="26">4. Preparation of DNA-binding Protein</p>
    <p num="27">
      A DNA-binding protein is a natural protein, either in its native state or modified.
      <br/>
      By "natural" we mean that is produced in an organism such as E. coli for recombinant proteins or isolated from an animal tissue, such as calf thymus or liver.
      <br/>
      By"DNA-binding protein" we mean that it associates with DNA under certain conditions and forms a complex with DNA with a high binding constant.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, the DNA-binding protein is cationic having a net positive-charge.
      <br/>
      One preferred type of DNA-binding protein is histone protein which is a group of proteins that form chromatin which is a structure in which DNA is present in living cells.
      <br/>
      Examples of histone proteins are H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4.
      <br/>
      Histone H1 protein is the preferred histone type.
      <br/>
      It can be purchased from several company suppliers such as Sigma, Life Technologies, or Boeringer-Manheim Corp.
      <br/>
      They prepare the histone H1 from tissues such as calf thymus or liver.
      <br/>
      All of the isolation procedures use the perchloric extraction technique.
      <br/>
      Column chromatography could be used to prepare the histone H1 also.
      <br/>
      To those skilled in the art, histone H1 proteins can be recognized in many species in how it is prepared by perchloric acid extraction.
      <br/>
      Histone H1 also signifies a specific amino acid sequence that is homologous across different species.
      <br/>
      Histone H1 also refers to its function as a linker chromatin protein which means that it cross-links DNA as it enters and leaves nucleosomes which are parts of chromatin.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In another embodiment, the DNA-binding protein is H2A or H2B which can be purchased from several suppliers such as Sigma, Life Technologies, or Boeringer-Manheim Corp.
      <br/>
      They are best prepared by ion exchange chromatography.
      <br/>
      H2A or H2B proteins can also be recognized by specific amino acid sequences that are homologous across different species.
      <br/>
      The histone H2A and H2B proteins are included in nucleosomes.
      <br/>
      The histone H1 protein can also be produced in bacteria using standard recombinant DNA technology.
      <br/>
      This enables the histone H1 to be easily modified or combined with other protein or peptide parts.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment the recombinant DNA-binding protein, NLS-H1, was prepared using the pET bacterial expression system (Novagene, Madison, Wis.) (Studier, F. W., Rosenberg, A. H., Dunn, J. J., and Dubendorff, J. W. (1990) methods Enzymol. 185, 60-89; incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      The coding sequence of the nuclear localizing signal from the SV40 large T antigen (amino acid residues PKKKRKVEDK, Kalderon, D., Roberts, B. L., Richardson, W. D., and Smith, A. E. (1984) Cell 39, 499-509; incorporated herein by reference) was linked to the sequence for the C-terminal domain of human histone H1 ) (amino acid residues 99-193, Doenecke, D., and Tonjes, R. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 187, 461-464; incorporated herein b reference) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
      <br/>
      The 5' primer contained nucleotides encoding the NLS sequence, and both primers contained restriction sites for cloning the PCR product into the NdeI/BamHI sites of pET16b (Novagene, Madison, Wis.) and nucleotides which complemented the sequence corresponding to the 7 amino acids at each end of the histone H1C-terminal domain.
      <br/>
      Following amplification of the desired region of DNA from genomic DNA (isolated from human peripheral blood, gift of R. Gregg), the amplified product was reacted with NdeI and BamHI restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs, Boston, Mass.) and ligated into pET16b.
      <br/>
      The resulting pDNA, pET16b-NLS-H1, was verified by sequence analysis and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagene).
      <br/>
      The approximate 16kDa NLS-H1protein was induced by adding IPTG to the growth medium to a final concentration of 1mM.
      <br/>
      The induced protein was solubilized in 7 M guanidinium hydrochloride dissolved in bind buffer (5 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9).
      <br/>
      Following renaturation in 10 volumes of bind buffer, the NLS-H1 protein was purified by Ni++ affinity chromatography (NTA-agarose, Qiagen, Chatsworth, Calif.).
      <br/>
      Fractions containing NLS-H1 were dialyzed against Hepes Buffered Saline (HBS as defined in Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular Cloning Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.).
      <br/>
      Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) and purity was analyzed by sodium-dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% polyacrylamide) as previously described (Fritz, J. D., Swartz, D. L., and Greaser, M. L. (1989) Anal. Biochem. 180, 205-210).

    <p num="29">5. Preparation of Amiphipathic Compounds</p>
    <p num="30">
      An amphipathic compound has both hydrophilic (water-soluble) and hydrophobic (water insoluble) parts.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment the amphipathic compounds constitute a liposome which are vesicles that contain one or more bilayers with an internal aqueous compartment.
      <br/>
      To those skilled in the art, liposomes can be prepared by a variety of techniques.
      <br/>
      The liposomes were prepared by mixing chloroform solutions of the different lipids in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Fisher) with screw caps and removing the chloroform in a SpeedVac SCV100 (Savante, Humble, Tex.) to produce dried lipid film.
      <br/>
      Tubes were placed under vacuum overnight to remove solvent traces.
      <br/>
      The amounts of cationic lipids in all preparations were 1.34 umol/ml with different amounts of other lipids as specified.
      <br/>
      One ml of sterile 10 mM HEPES pH 7.8 was added, vortexed for 1 min at room temperature and then sonicated in bath sonicator (Branson 2200) to obtain a clear emulsion.
      <br/>
      DOPE (Sigma or Avanti, Alabaster, Ala.) was included in some of the liposomes.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In one preferred embodiment the liposome is non-cationic which means that its net charge is neutral or negatively charged.
      <br/>
      It can be prepared using dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE) alone or combined with other lipids such as dioleoylphosphatidyl serine (DOPS) or oleic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In another embodiment, the liposome is cationic which means that its net charge is positively-charged.
      <br/>
      These include cationic liposomes that can be purchased from commercial suppliers such as Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Bethesda, Md.), LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies), DOTMA (Boeringer-Manheim Corp.) or TansfectACE (Promega Co., Madison, Wis.).
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In yet another embodiment, the amphipathic compound contains one or more cationic amphipathic compounds.
      <br/>
      These cationic amphipathic compounds can be non-natural polyamines wherein one or more of the amines is bound to at least one hydrophobic moiety wherein the hydrophobic moiety is from a group of compounds having a polar first end and a hydrophobic second end, for example: C6-C24 alkane, C6-C24 alkene, sterol, steroid, lipid, fatty acid and hydrophobic hormone.
      <br/>
      Examples of non-natural polyamine wherein one or more of the amines is bound to at least one hydrophobic moiety include compounds -4, -11, -16, -17, -20, -21, -23, -30, and -32.
      <br/>
      These non-natural polyamines are incorporated into liposomes either by themselves or combined with DOPE.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, the ternary complexes were formed by first mixing 3ug of luciferase plasmid DNA and 6.0 ug histone H1 (Sigma) in serum free medium (10 minutes room temperature) at a 1:2.0 wt:wt ratio in a final volume of at least 150 ul.
      <br/>
      Cationic lipsomes were then added to generate a final DNA:histone:liposome ratio of 1:2.0:0.2-1.5 and incubated at room temperature for an additional 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      This pDNA:histone H1:cationic liposome ratio yielded a positively charged overall complex.

    <p num="34">6. Exposure of Cells to Transfection Complexes</p>
    <p num="35">
      Before transfection, the cells are washed once with 2 ml Opti-MEM (Life Technologies Inc.) followed by the addition of 2 ml to each well.
      <br/>
      Transfection competent complexes were formed using 3 ug of plasmid DNA (encoding luciferase) in a total volume of 150 ul (Opti-MEM+pDNA+liposomes).
      <br/>
      The mixtures were incubated at least 10 min at room temperature prior to being added to the cells in the culture dish.
      <br/>
      After the cells were incubated at 37 degrees C. in 5% CO2 /95% air for four hours, the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with 2 ml of DMEM (Life Technologies Inc.)+10% FCS. The cultures were incubated for 24 to 40 hours until they were harvested for analysis of their reporter gene expression.

    <p num="55">Methods</p>
    <p num="56">
      NLS-H1 preparation--A recombinant DNA-binding protein, NLS-H1, was prepared using the pET bacterial expression system (Studier, F. W., Rosenberg, A. H., Dunn, J. J., and Dubendorff, J. W. (1990) Methods Enzymol. 185, 60-89).
      <br/>
      The coding sequence of the nuclear localizing signal from the SV40 large T antigen (amino acid residues PKKKRKVEDK, Kalderon, D., Roberts, B. L., Richardson, W. D., and Smith, A. E. (1984) Cell 39, 499-509) was linked to the sequence for the C-terminal domain of human histone H1 (amino acid residues 99-193, Doenecke, D., and Tonjes, R. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 187, 461-464) using PCR.
      <br/>
      The 5' primer contained nucleotides encoding the NLS sequence, and both primers contained restriction sites for cloning the PCR product into the Ndel/BamHI sites of pET16b (Novagene) and nucleotides which complemented the sequence corresponding to the 7 amino acids at each end of the histone H1 C-terminal domain.
      <br/>
      Following amplifications of the desired region of DNA from genomic DNA (isolated from human peripheral blood, gift of R. Gregg), the amplified product was reacted with Ndel and BamHI restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs) and ligated into pET16b.
      <br/>
      The resulting pDNA, pET16-NLS-H1, was verified by sequence analysis and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagene).
      <br/>
      The approximate 16-kDa NLS-H1 protein was induced by adding IPTG (isopropyl thio-galactopyranoside) to the growth medium to a final concentration of 1 mM.
      <br/>
      The induced protein was solubilized in 7M guanidinium hydrochloride dissolved in bind buffer (5 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9).
      <br/>
      Following renaturation in 10 volumes of bind buffer, the NLS-H1 protein was purified by Ni++ affinity chromatography (NTA-agarose, Ciagene).
      <br/>
      Fractions containing NLS-H1 were dialyzed against Hepes Buffered Saline (HBS).
      <br/>
      Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) and purity was analyzed by sodium-dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% polyacrylamide) as previously described (Fritz, J. D., Swartz, D. L., and Greaser, M. L. (1989) Anal. Biochem. 180, 205-210).

      Binding of NLS-H1 to pDNA--Migration of pDNA (plasmid DNA) in agarose gels was altered by the addition of NLS-H1.
      <br/>
      Plasmid DNA containing no NLS-H1 had the expected migration of both supercoiled and open circular forms.
      <br/>
      The addition of 0.16 mg NLS-H1/mg pDNA resulted in the appearance of a band slightly above the supercoiled band, and prevented some pDNA from migrating into the gel.
      <br/>
      No difference in the intensity or migration of the open circular pDNA form was observed.
      <br/>
      At 0.4 mg NLS-H1/mg pDNA, the supercoiled band migration was further retarded, and a large amount of material remained in the sample well.
      <br/>
      The intensity of the open circular form of the pDNA was also decreased by the addition of 0.4 mg NLS-H1/mg pDNA.
      <br/>
      At 0.8-1.6 mg NLS-H1/mg pDNA, both supercoiled and open circular bands no longer migrated int the gel and the only visible material was at the sample well.
      <br/>
      Similar gel retardation patterns were obtained for pDNA complexes made with calf thymus histone H1, H2A/B, H3/H4, poly-L-lysine, or protamine and the amounts required to obtain plasmid migration patterns similar to those obtained for 0.4 mg NLS-H1/mg pDNA complexes were 1.05, 1.8, 4.5, 0.65, or 0.6 mg/mg pDNA, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      EM studies were conducted to study binding of NLS-H1 to pDNA as well.
      <br/>
      Plasmid DNA was predominantly supercoiled prior to NLS-H1 binding but open circular forms were also observed.
      <br/>
      After NLS-H1 binding, the pDNA appeared condensed and rod-like.
      <br/>
      These rod shaped structures could be observed at concentrations as low as 0.16 mg NLS-H1/mg pDNA, and predominated at 0.4 mg NLS-H1/mg pDNA.
      <br/>
      Increasing the amount of NLS-H1 resulted in additional compaction of the pDNA, and also the formation of large aggregates.
      <br/>
      Samples containing 1.6 mg NLS-H1/mg pDNA precipitated.
      <br/>
      Similar structures were observed for complexes studied with calf thymus histone H1 and poly-L-lysine but the poly-L-lysine complexes tended to aggregate more readily.
    </p>
    <p num="63">Discussion</p>
    <p num="64">
      The extent of pDNA binding by the basic proteins was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and EM studies.
      <br/>
      Addition of approximately 125 NLS-H1 molecules/pDNA molecule (0.4 mg NLS-H1/mg pBS.RSVLux) substantially reduced the quantity of pDNA entering the agarose gel.
      <br/>
      This ratio putatively neutralizes about 75% of the pDNA charge based on the number of lysine and arginine residues in NLS-H1.
      <br/>
      Substantial compaction of pDNA to rod-shaped structures also occurred with 125 NLS-H1 molecules/pDNA molecule.
      <br/>
      Doubling the molar ratio to 250 NLS-H1/pDNA (0.8 mg NLS-H1/mg pDNA) prevented all of the pDNA from entering the agarose gel and which, as the EM studies indicated, was associated with the formation of large aggregates.
      <br/>
      Precipitation of the pDNA from solution occurred at 500 NLS-H1 molecules/pDNA molecule (1.6 mg NLS-H1/mg pDNA).
      <br/>
      These results suggest that NLS-H1 binds pDNA.

      The luciferase activity was at least 45 times higher in COS7 cells and at least 20 times in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with ternary NLS-H1-pDNA-lipofectin complexes compared to binary pDNA-lipofectin complexes.

      The use of 0.16-0.8  MU g NLS-H1/ MU g pDNA with 3  MU g of lipofectin/ MU g pDNA increased luciferase activity approximately 3-fold.

      Similar decreases (based on total protein measured at the time of luciferase assay) were also observed for NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown).

      In COS-7 cells, approximately 30% of the cells stained positive for B-galactosidase in NLS-H-1-pDNA-lipofectin transfected samples compared to at most 9% in pDNA lipofectin transfected samples.

      Cells transfected with ternary DNA-binding protein-pDNA-lipofectin complexes had substantially increased luciferase and B-galactosidase expression compared to transfections using binary pDNA-lipofectin complexes.

      The increase in expression was greatest for samples containing NLS-H1 or calf thymus histone H1 or H2A/B.

      In addition, transfection complexes containing NLS H1 required the least amount of lipofectin (0.375  MU g) to obtain optimal levels of gene expression.
      <br/>
      Histone H1 increased the transfection efficiency of not only lipofectin but also other cationic lipid formulations including DOTAP, lipofectACE, and lipofectAMINE.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, NLS-H1/pDNA-lipofectin complexes were superior to other transfection complexes examined in this study involving gene transfer into cultured mammalian cells based on the levels of foreign gene expression, reduced cellular toxicity, and the low amount of lipofectin and protein reagents required to prepare these complexes.

      The ability to produce a recombinant DNA-binding protein may lead to alternative approaches in receptor-mediated gene transfer techniques.
      <br/>
      Currently, receptor-mediated gene transfer techniques rely upon chemical cross-linking to attach the desired ligand to the DNA-binding protein (Wu, G. Y., and Wu, C. H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14621-14624; Wagner, E., Zenke, M., Cotten, M., Beug, H., and Birnstiel, M. L. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 3410-3414).
      <br/>
      In the case of peptide derived ligands, it should now be possible to produce an entirely recombinant molecule which avoids chemical cross-linking strategies and can easily be purified.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      In summary, NLS-H1-pDNA-lipofectin complexes gave superior gene transfer compared to the other complexes studied.
      <br/>
      These complexes used the least amount of protein and cationic liposome reagent, and transferred reporter genes to greater numbers of cells with lower cytotoxicity than complexes containing lipofectAMINE.
      <br/>
      The availability and simplicity in using these reagents provides a rapid and inexpensive means to greatly enhance cationic lipid-mediated gene transfer.

      A substantial amount of the DOPE liposomes were precipitated only when the plasmid DNA was added to the liposomes in the presence of H1 protein.

      Without the H1 protein, a trivial amount of complexes formed between the DNA and liposomes.

      Similar results were obtained with anionic liposomes containing 10% DOPS (dioleoylphosphatidylserine) and 90% DOPE (data not shown).
      <br/>
      In addition, when the amount of plasmid DNA was assayed in the precipitate and supernatant, a substantial amount of plasmid DNA was present only in the DOPE+H1+DNA mixture (data not shown).

      These results demonstrate that histone H1 enables plasmid DNA to be complexed substantially with non-cationic liposomes.

      These results demonstrate that the plasmid DNA within the ternary complexes containing H1 and DOPE or the ternary complexes containing H1 and DOPE/DOPS liposomes are completely accessible to interaction with ethidium bromide.
      <br/>
      This is in striking contrast to inability of ethidium bromide to interact with plasmid DNA within other types of liposomes.

      Several published studies have demonstrated that plasmid DNA complexed with cationic lipids such as Lipofectin (BRL) is inaccessible to ethidium bromide.

    <p num="128">Methods</p>
    <p num="129">
      Transfection competent complexes are prepared by first mixing histone H1 with either neutral liposomes containing only dioleoyl phophatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE); negative liposomes containing dioleoyl phosphatidyl serine (DOPS) and DOPE; or pH-sensitive negative liposomes containing DOPE and oleic acid.
      <br/>
      The initial binary complexes were prepared at a ratio of 12  MU g liposomes:1.5  MU g histone H1 in 100  MU l 30 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.5 for DOPE liposomes or 100  MU l OptiMEM (BRL) for DOPS/DOPE liposomes.
      <br/>
      After a 10 minute incubation at room temperature supercoiled plasmid DNA (pDNA) in 30mM Tris-HC1 pH 8.5(Opti-MEM for DOPS/DOPE liposomes) is added in a 100  MU l volume to form ternary complexes at a final ratio of liposomes:protein:pDNA of 12:1.5:1. These complexes are incubated for an additional 15 minutes at room temperature before being added directly to washed cells (40-60% confluent).
      <br/>
      For 35 mm plates we add 200  MU l of pre-formed complexes to wells containing 1.8 ml of Opti-MEM (Gibco-BRL) and incubate on the cells for 2-4 hours at 37 degrees Celsius.
      <br/>
      After this incubation, complexes are aspirated off the cells and replaced with growth medium (DMEM+10% fetal calf serum).
      <br/>
      Cells are harvested and assayed for luciferase activity after 24-72 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      The liposomes were prepared by mixing chloroform solutions of the different lipids in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes (Fisher) with screw caps and removing the chloroform in a SpeedVac SVC100 (Savant) to produce dried lipid films.
      <br/>
      Tubes were placed under vacuum overnight to remove solvent traces.
      <br/>
      One ml of sterile 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.8 was added, vortexed for 1 min at room temperature and then sonicated in bath sonicator (Branson 2200) to obtain a clear emulsion.

      Similar to cationic liposome/protein/pDNA complexes, ternary complexes consisting of plasmid DNA, H1 and either negatively charged (DOPS/DOPE), neutral (DOPE) or pH-sensitive negatively charged (Oleic acid/DOPE) liposomes can efficiently deliver genes to 3T3 cells (Table above).
      <br/>
      In agreement with this, HepG2 and COS cells are also efficiently transfected by histone H1/DOPE liposomes with resultant luciferase activities of 2 * 108 to 9.5 * 108 light units/milligram of total protein.

      These results show that complexes of plasmid DNA and histone H1 and liposomes can transfect a variety of cultured cells with a substantial amount of transfection efficiency.
      <br/>
      These liposomes can either be negatively-charged (DOPS/DOPE), pH-sensitive negatively charged (oleic acid/DOPE), or neutral (DOPE alone).

      The benefit of the histone-based component liposomal system lies in its inherent flexibility with regard to assembling a wide variety of complexes by changing only one component.
      <br/>
      Up until now, only cationic liposomes could be used to package DNA into complexes quickly and efficiently.
      <br/>
      We now present evidence that pDNA/H1 can form transfection competent complexes with pH sensitive, anionic, and cationic liposomes.
      <br/>
      Thus a wide range of very different liposomes can be incorporated into these ternary complexes and tested for transfection capabilities both in vitro and in vivo.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      Futhermore, up to now it was believed that plasmid DNA had to be within liposomes in order to be efficiently transfected.
      <br/>
      From a simplistic standpoint, it is easy to visualize that once DNA is encapsulated within the aqueous environment of a liposome, a fusion event with either the plasma membrane or an internal endosome would allow the aqueous contents to be extruded into the cytoplasm.
      <br/>
      Thus it was unexpected when we found that the pDNA was on the outside of transfection competent ternary complexes consisting of liposomes, DNA-binding protein, and pDNA.
      <br/>
      If the DNA is associated with the outside of a liposome, it is unclear how it would access the cytoplasm even after a liposome-mediated fusion event.
