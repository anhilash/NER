    <p num="1">This application is a con of PCT/6891/00706, filed May 2, 1991.</p>

      The present invention relates to nucleoside analogues and their use in medicine.
      <br/>
      More specifically the invention is concerned with 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside analogues, pharmaceutical formulations thereof and the use thereof in the treatment of viral infections.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The compound of formula (I)  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="4">
      also known as BCH-189 or NGPB-21 has been described as having antiviral activity in particular against the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV's), the causative agents of AIDS (5th Anti-Aids Conference, Montreal, Canada Jun. 5th-9th 1989: Abstracts T.C.O.1 and M.C.P. 63: European Patent Application Publication No. 0382562).
      <br/>
      The compound of formula (I) is a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers of formulae (I-1) and (I-2):  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      and was described and tested in the form of its racemate.
      <br/>
      The only compound currently approved for the treatment of conditions caused by HIV is 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT, zidovudine, BW 509U).
      <br/>
      However, this compound has a significant side-effect liability and thus either cannot be employed or, once employed, may have to be withdrawn in a significant number of patients.
      <br/>
      There is in consequence a continuing need to provide compounds which are effective against HIV but with a concommitant significantly better therapeutic index.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      We have now found that, surprisingly, enantiomers of the compound of formula (I) are equipotent against HIV but that one of the enantiomers (the (-)-enantiomer) has considerably lower cytotoxicity than the other enantiomer.
      <br/>
      There is thus provided in a first aspect of the invention the (-) (or laevorotatory) enantiomer of the compound of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.

      It will be appreciated that the above reactions may require the use of, or conveniently may be applied to, starting materials having protected functional groups, and deprotection might thus be required as an intermediate or final step to yield the desired compound.
      <br/>
      Protection and deprotection of functional groups may be effected using conventional means.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, amino groups may be protected by a group selected from aralkyl (e.g. benzyl), acyl, aryl (e.g. 2,4-dinitrophenyl) or silyl; subsequent removal of the protecting group being effected when desired by hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis as appropriate using standard conditions.
      <br/>
      Hydroxyl groups may be protected using any conventional hydroxyl protecting group, for example, as described in `Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry`, Ed. J. F. W. McOmie (Plenum Press, 1973) or `Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis` by Theodora W. Greene (John Wiley and Sons, 1981).
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable hydroxyl protecting groups include groups selected from alkyl (e.g. methyl, t-butyl or methoxymethyl), aralkyl ( e.g. benzyl, diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl), heterocyclic groups such as tetrahydropyranyl, acyl (e.g. acetyl or benzoyl) and silyl groups such as trialkylsilyl (e.g. t-butyldimethylsilyl).
      <br/>
      The hydroxyl protecting groups may be removed by conventional techniques.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, alkyl, silyl, acyl and heterocyclic groups may be removed by solvolysis, e.g. by hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions.
      <br/>
      Aralkyl groups such as triphenylmethyl may similarly be removed by solvolysis, e.g. by hydrolysis under acidic conditions.
      <br/>
      Aralkyl groups such as benzyl may be cleaved for example by treatment with BF3 /etherate and acetic anhydride followed by removal of acetate groups so formed at an appropriate stage in the synthesis.
      <br/>
      Silyl groups may also conveniently be removed using a source of fluoride ions such as tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride.
    </p>
    <p num="65">In the above processes compound (A) is generally obtained as a mixture of the cis and trans isomers of which the cis isomer is the compound of interest.</p>
    <p num="66">These isomers may be separated by physical means e.g. chromatography on silica gel or by fractional crystallisation, either directly or on a suitable derivatives thereof, eg acetates (prepared for example with acetic anhydride) followed, after separation, by conversion back to the parent product (eg by deacetylation with methanolic ammonia).</p>

      Thus, for example, when it is desired to prepare an acid addition salt of compound (A) the product of any of the above procedures may be converted into a salt by treatment of the resulting free base with a suitable acid using conventional methods.
      <br/>
      Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared by reacting the free base with an appropriate acid optionally in the presence of a suitable solvent such as an ester (e.g. ethyl acetate) or an alcohol (e.g. methanol, ethanol or isopropanol).
      <br/>
      Inorganic basic salts may be prepared by reacting the parent compound with a suitable base such as an alkoxide (e.g. sodium methoxide) optionally in the presence of a solvent such as an alcohol (e.g. methanol).
      <br/>
      Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be prepared from other salts, including other pharmaceutically acceptable salts, of the compound (A) using conventional methods.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Compound (A) may be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable phsophate or other ester by reaction with a phosphorylating agent, such as POCl3, or a suitable esterifying agent, such as an acid halide or anhydride, as appropriate.

      An ester or salt of compound (A) may be converted to the parent compound for example by hydrolysis.
    </p>
    <p num="69">Resolution of the final product, or an intermediate or starting material therefor may be effected by any suitable method known in the art: see for example `Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds` by E. L. Eliel (McGraw Hill, 1962) and `Tables of Resolving Agents` by S. H. Wilen.</p>
    <p num="70">
      Thus for example the compound (A) may obtained by chiral HPLC using suitable stationary phase for example acetylated  BETA -cyclodextrin or cellulose triacetate and suitable solvent for example an alcohol such as ethanol or an aqueous solution of for example triethyl ammonium acetate.

      Alternatively the compounds may be resolved by enzyme mediated enantioselective catabolism with a suitable enzyme such as cytidine deaminase or selective enzymatic degradation of a suitable derivative using a 5'-nucleotidase.

      When resolution is effected enzymatically the enzyme may be employed either in solution or, more conveniently, in immobilised form.

      The frozen cell paste (150 g) was thawed and suspended in 750 ml of 100 mM Hepes (N-�2-hydroxyethyl�piperazine-N'-�2-ethane sulphonic acid�) buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (sodium salt) and 1 mM dithiothreitol (disruption buffer).
      <br/>
      The cells were disrupted by passing the suspension through a Manton-Gaulin homogeniser operating at 7500 psi.

      This was carried out three times with cooling of the suspension to approximately 5 (degree)  C. after each pass through the homogeniser.

      The bound enzyme was eluted by a gradient of decreasing ammonium sulphate concentration.

      The uridine analogue adsorbed to the resin and the (-)-enantiomer passed straight through.
