      A method of producing high coercivity FePt-Si3N4 granular composite thin films for magnetic recording media is invented.
      <br/>
      The method includes magnetron co-sputtering of FePt and Si3N4 targets at controlled sputtering power and sputtering argon gas pressure to form a selective composition of granular FePt-Si3N4 thin film on a low temperature substrate, then post-annealed in vacuum at selective time period and temperature.
      <br/>
      Two kinds of FePt targets can be used.
      <br/>
      One is the FePt alloy target.
      <br/>
      The other one is a composite target consisting of an iron disk overlaid with small Pt pieces.
      <br/>
      This arrangement provides a wide range of effective target compositions and therefore film compositions.
      <br/>
      FePt-Si3N4 films were deposited on natural oxidized silicon wafer or quartz glass substrate at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The as-deposited film has soft magnetic properties and granular structure with soft magnetic gamma-FePt particles dispersed in amorphous Si3N4 matrix.
      <br/>
      The as-deposited film cannot be used as magnetic recording medium due to its low coercivity.
      <br/>
      After annealing at controlled conditions for a desirable temperature and time period in vacuum, the film also has granular structure but the magnetic soft gamma-FePt phase is transformed into magnetic hard gamma1-FePt phase.
      <br/>
      This film has high coercivity and its magnetic easy-axis is parallel to the film plane.
      <br/>
      It may be used as high-density magnetic recording medium.

    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      For a long time now, the most important problem in magnetic recording medium has been how to increase its recording density.
      <br/>
      A high recording density medium needs high coercivity Hc and optimum remnant magnetization Mr for giant magnetic resistance (GMR) and MR read-heads.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      At present, the CoCrPtM (M=Ni, Ta, W) alloy thin films are the most widely used magnetic recording materials for hard disk drive, due to their high coercivity (Hc&gt;2800 Oe).
      <br/>
      However, these alloy thin films have two disadvantages for high recording density applications: (1) media noise is too high, and (2) coercivity is not enough, therefore the recording density can not be increased.
      <br/>
      For these metallic films, the most significant problem is the noise that results from magnetic exchange coupling between the grains located at the domain transition region (Jian-Gang Zhu, "Transition Noise Properties in Longitudinal Thin Film Media", IEEE Trans.
      <br/>
      Magn. Vol. 29, no.1, pp.195-200, 1993).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the areal recording density of the metallic film is to be increased, the grain size of the film must be reduced (D. N. Lambeth, E. M. T. Velu, G. H. Bellesis, L. L. Lee, and D. E. Laughlin, "Media for 10 Gb/in2 Hard Disk Storage: Issues and Status", J. Appl. Phys., 78(8), pp.4496-4501, 1996).
      <br/>
      However, due to the lack of enough space among grains to reduce the magnetic exchange coupling between the grains, even the grain size of the continuous metallic film is decreased to single-domain size, the high media noise will lead to read-write error and system instability. (E. I. Kondorsky, "On the stability of certain magnetic modes in fine ferromagnetic particles", IEEE Trans.
      <br/>
      Magn. Vol. 15, no.5, pp.1209-1214, 1986).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      To improve the disadvantages of cobalt-based alloy thin films described above, the present inventors have invented high coercivity granular thin films with FePt particles dispersed in a non-magnetically amorphous Si3 N4 matrix, for use as a recording media for higher density magnetic recording.
      <br/>
      Since the magnetic FePt particles in these granular films are isolated, the media noise of the films can be largely reduced.
      <br/>
      In addition, by using high magnetocrystalline anisotropy FePt particles as recording material, the recording bits of this granular film can be reduced and recording density of the film will be increased, provided that the write ability of magnetic head is strong enough.
      <br/>
      These granular films for recording media has many other good properties such as oxidization resistance, corrosion resistance and wear resistance due to the magnetic particles being surrounded by an insulator material Si3 N4.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">The object of the present invention is to fabricate high coercivity FePt--Si3 N4 granular thin films for high-density magnetic recording media.</p>
    <p num="8">
      A granular FePt--Si3 N4 thin film with soft magnetic  GAMMA -FePt particles dispersed in amorphous Si3 N4 matrix was prepared by the co-sputtering of a FePt target and Si3 N4 target on a low temperature substrate.
      <br/>
      After an optimum heat treatment, a high coercivity FePt--Si3 N4 granular thin film with magnetic hard  GAMMA 1 -FePt particles dispersed in amorphous Si3 N4 matrix is obtained.
      <br/>
      The granular thin film has a magnetic easy-axis parallel to the film plane.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Magnetic granular thin film has an especially artificial structure.
      <br/>
      Usually, the magnetic properties of granular thin film are different from that of continuous metal thin film due to the fact that the magnetic particles of granular film are isolated by non-magnetic material.
      <br/>
      Changing the non-magnetic material content of the film will change the magnetic particles' inter-particle distance, particle size, and particle shape.
      <br/>
      These parameters all directly affect the magnetic properties of the film.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The present inventors use FePt alloy as the magnetic particles of granular film media due to its high magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant (Ku =7 * 107 erg/cm3), high curie temperature, and good stability.

      Trans., JIM. 37, pp.489-493, 1996).
      <br/>
      The high coercivity granular FePt--Si3 N4 thin films produced by the method of the invention may be one of the most promising candidates for future high-density magnetic recording media.
      <br/>
      The method of the present invention includes using magnetron co-sputtering of a FePt and a Si3 N4 target at a controlled sputtering power and argon gas pressure to form a selective composition of granular FePt--Si3 N4 thin films on a low temperature substrate.
      <br/>
      The as-deposited film has a granular structure and soft magnetic properties.
      <br/>
      After annealing in a vacuum, the soft magnetic  GAMMA -FePt particles of as-deposited film are transformed into hard magnetic  GAMMA 1 -FePt phase with a very high coercivity.
      <br/>
      These annealed films can be used for magnetic recording media.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The granular FePt--Si3 N4 composite thin films were produced by magnetron co-sputtering of FePt and Si3 N4 targets on a natural oxidized silicon wafer substrate or a quartz glass substrate at room temperature then post-annealed in a vacuum.
      <br/>
      The as-deposited FePt--Si3 N4 films have a granular structure with soft magnetic  GAMMA -FePt particles dispersed in amorphous Si3 N4 matrix.
      <br/>
      After annealing in a vacuum, the Si3 N4 matrix keeps an amorphous structure but the films have high coercivity.
      <br/>
      The magnetic easy-axis of these films are parallel to film plane.
      <br/>
      These films may be used as high-density magnetic recording media.
      <br/>
      The films have magnetic properties of, for example, Ms&gt;375 emu/cm3 and Hc&gt;2000 Oe.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The granular FePt--Si3 N4 composite thin films of this invention are prepared by a conventional magnetron sputtering system with a DC and a RF power supply then post-annealed in a vacuum.
      <br/>
      Two types of FePt targets were used in this invention; one is the FePt alloy target, the other one is the composite target consisting of iron (Fe) disk overlaid with small platinum (Pt) pieces.
      <br/>
      The FePt particle composition in the granular FePt--Si3 N4 thin film is preferably in the range between 45 and 55 atomic percent Pt.
      <br/>
      For optimized magnetic properties a more narrow range of 48 to 52 atomic percent Pt is preferred.
      <br/>
      The base pressure in the sputtering chamber was 5 * 10-7 Torr or lower.
      <br/>
      After a high purity argon gas (99.9995%) was introduced, the argon pressure PAr, was set at 0.3.about.20 mTorr. Sputtering rates of the pure FePt and pure Si3 N4 films are dependent on PAr.
      <br/>
      In order to get good magnetic properties, the PAr of 3.about.5 mTorr is preferred.
      <br/>
      The sputtering guns were charged with the following power levels: the applied DC power source was set at 40 W, and RF power source was varied from 30 to 280 W. The deposition rate of FePt is about 0.3 nm/s. A natural oxidized silicon wafer substrate or quartz glass substrate was used, and the substrate temperature was less than 45 (degree)  C., for example, about 25 (degree)  C. The sputtering conditions of the granular FePt--Si3 N4 thin films are shown in table 1 and table 2.
      <br/>
      After deposition, the as-deposited film was post-annealed in vacuum (&lt;1 * 10-6 Torr) at, for example, a temperature between 400 and 800 (degree)  C. with a time period between 5 and 90 minutes and then quenched in ice-water.
      <br/>
      The temperature of quenching liquid is less than 5 (degree)  C., for example, about 0 (degree)  C.

    </p>
    <p num="16">The differences between this invention and prior art can be summarized as follows:</p>
    <p num="17">
      (1) In the prior art, granular FePt--Si3 N4 composite thin films, especially high coercivity granular FePt--Si3 N4 thin films which maybe used for high-density magnetic recording media have never been fabricated.
      <br/>
      (2) In this invention, in order to get good granular structure of FePt--Si3 N4 thin films, the optimum substrate temperature and DC sputtering power during deposition are near 25 and 40 W, respectively.
      <br/>
      (3) In order to obtain high coercivity FePt--Si3 N4 granular thin films for high-density magnetic recording, the composition of FePt particles in the as-deposited granular FePt--Si3 N4 thin films must be close to Fe50 Pt50.
      <br/>
      When the Pt content beyond 50 at. %, an excess of Pt atoms will lead to a decrease of the magnetic properties of annealed film.
      <br/>
      (4) In this invention, the high coercivity FePt--Si3 N4 granular thin films for high-density magnetic recording media were formed by a phase transformation reaction, i.e. a preliminary soft magnetic  GAMMA -FePt phase was formed, and then it was transferred to a high magnetocrystalline anisotropy hard magnetic  GAMMA 1 -FePt phase after an annealing treatment.
      <br/>
      (5) In this invention, in order to get the high coercivity FePt--Si3 N4 granular thin films for high-density magnetic recording media, the optimum annealing temperature and annealing time are near 600 (degree)  C. and 30 minutes, respectively.
      <br/>
      (6) In this invention, in order to get the high coercivity FePt--Si3 N4 granular thin films for high-density magnetic recording media, the optimum quenching temperature after annealing is 0 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      More examples and experiment results of the invention will be set forth below to affirm above conclusion.
      <br/>
      Magnetic properties of the films were measured with superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Microstructure of the films was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
      <br/>
      Composition and homogeneity of the films were determined by energy disperse X-ray diffractometer (EDX).
    </p>
    <p num="19">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="20">
      The initial substrate temperature was at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The substrate rotates at a speed of 75 rpm.
      <br/>
      After the sputtering chamber was evacuated to 5 * 10-7 Torr, Ar gas was introduced into the chamber.
      <br/>
      The Ar pressure was maintained at about 5 mTorr during the entire sputtering period.
      <br/>
      The deposition rates of films are shown in table 2.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows the relationships among saturation magnetization Ms, in-plane coercivity Hc, and Si3 N4 volume fraction Vf of the as-deposited FePt--Si3 N4 films.
      <br/>
      The Ms value of the film decreased linearly with increasing Vf.
      <br/>
      The Ms value is about 750 emu/cm3 when Vf is 0 vol. %(pure FePt film), and as Vf is increased to 50 vol. %, it decreases to about 375 emu/cm3, which is only one half of the pure FePt film.
      <br/>
      It can be understood that Si3 N4 is a non-magnetic phase, and it plays only the simple role of diluting the magnetization of the film.
      <br/>
      The variation of Hc with Vf was small, as Vf was between 0 vol. % and 50 vol. % Si3 N4. Hc remained at about 50 Oe.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 2(a) is the TEM bright field image of the as-deposited (FePt)80 --(Si3 N4)20 film.
      <br/>
      The film thickness is 200 nm.
      <br/>
      It reveals that the average particle size of FePt is about 5 nm.
      <br/>
      The network-like structure results because the FePt particles are surrounded by a Si3 N4 matrix.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2(b) is the selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern of FIG. 2(a).
      <br/>
      The well-marked diffraction rings indicate that the structure of the as-deposited film was not amorphous.
      <br/>
      As we compared this TEM diffraction pattern with that of the sputtered pure Si3 N4 film, we confirmed that the Si3 N4 film has an amorphous structure in the as-deposition film.
      <br/>
      From the TEM diffraction pattern analysis, we know that the crystal phase of the as-deposited film is fcc  GAMMA -FePt phase, as shown in FIG. 2(b).
      <br/>
      From FIG. 2(a) we could see this film has a granular structure, it is suitable for the further heat-treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="22">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="23">
      The sputtering conditions and the FePt composition were the same as example 1.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows the relationships between the in-plane coercivity Hc and annealed temperature Tan of the annealed FePt--Si3 N4 films with various Si3 N4 volume fractions (vol. %=0, 10, 30, and 50).
      <br/>
      The film is quenched in ice-water after annealing.
      <br/>
      As Vf is equal to 0 vol. % (i.e. pure Fe50 Pt50), the Hc value can reach 10 kOe after the film is annealed at 600 (degree)  C. As Tan is higher than 650 (degree)  C., the Hc value of pure Fe50 Pt50 film is lower than 2 kOe.
      <br/>
      For the (FePt)70 --(Si3 N4)30 film, its Hc value is about 2 kOe as Tan =550 (degree)  C., and it increases rapidly with increasing Tan to reach its maximum value of 11 kOe at Tan =750 (degree)  C. then quickly decreases as Tan is increased further.
      <br/>
      For this film, the increase of Hc value with increasing Tan as Tan &lt;750 (degree)  C. is due to the gradual transformation of the soft  GAMMA -FePt phase to the hard  GAMMA 1 -FePt phase, and the  GAMMA 1 -FePt phase has very high magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant.
      <br/>
      As Tan &gt;750 (degree)  C., the decrease of Hc value with increasing Tan is due to the growth of FePt grains and the reaction of FePt with the Si substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      From FIG. 3 we also can see that the increase of Si3 N4 content in the film will increase the annealing temperature required for getting high coercivity.
      <br/>
      Pure Fe50 Pt50 film must be annealed between 500 (degree)  C. and 600 (degree)  C., resulting in a coercivity higher than 3 kOe; however, adding 30 vol. % of Si3 N4 raises this temperature range to between 600 and 900 (degree)  C. This is due to the fact that the amorphous Si3 N4 phase postpones the initial temperature, which transforms the fcc  GAMMA -FePt phase to the fct  GAMMA 1 -FePt phase.
      <br/>
      For pure FePt film, the as-deposited  GAMMA -FePt thin film included the nucleation site of  GAMMA 1 -FePt phase.
      <br/>
      For the as-deposited FePt--Si3 N4 film, the FePt particles are surrounded by the insulator Si3 N4, which is a poor heat-conductor.
      <br/>
      The  GAMMA -FePt particles in as-deposited FePt--Si3 N4 film can not be transformed to  GAMMA 1 -FePt phase completely by quenching the film in ice-water after annealing.
      <br/>
      The Si3 N4 content would affect the magnetic hardness of the granular FePt--Si3 N4 film after annealing.
      <br/>
      From FIG. 3 we can see that the addition of the amorphous Si3 N4 phase can raise the initial phase transformation temperature at which  GAMMA -FePt is transformed into the  GAMMA 1 -FePt phase.
      <br/>
      The coercivity of annealed FePt--Si3 N4 film could be larger than that of pure FePt film due to the completely isolated small FePt grains with appropriate inter-granular distance and the stress anisotropy of the particles.
      <br/>
      As the amount of the magnetic phase is fixed, not only the magnetic grain size but also the inter-granular distance were increased with increasing annealing temperature.
      <br/>
      The growth of magnetic FePt grains would decrease the coercivity of granular film.
    </p>
    <p num="25">In general, post-annealed FePt--Si3 N4 film's Hc value is increased with increasing Tan, and after it reaches its maximum values at some characteristic Tan, it will decrease again.</p>
    <p num="26">
      As 30-vol. %.about.50 vol. % Si3 N4 is added in pure Fe50 Pt50 film, the Si3 N4 phase in the FePt--Si3 N4 granular film will protect the FePt particles at high temperatures.
      <br/>
      However, Ms value of the film is decreased linearly with increasing Vf.
      <br/>
      The coercivities of the (FePt)70 --(Si3 N4)30 films that annealed between 550.about.600 (degree)  C. are between 3000 Oe and 4000 Oe, and their Ms values are about 525 emu/cm3.
      <br/>
      These films are suitable for high-density magnetic recording media.

      FIG. 4 shows the relationships among in-plane squareness (S=Mr/Ms), switching field distribution (SFD), and Tan of the (FePt)70 --(Si3 N4)30 film, which is ice-water quenched after annealing.
      <br/>
      The annealing time is 30 min.
      <br/>
      We found that both the maximum S value and the minimum SFD value occur at Tan =700 (degree)  C. The maximum S value is about 0.9, and the minimum SFD value is about 0.2. As Tan &lt;700 (degree)  C., the S value is kept about 0.8. As Tan &gt;700 (degree)  C., the S value decreases slowly with increasing Tan.
      <br/>
      For the film used in magnetic recording media needs high S value and low SFD value.
    </p>
    <p num="29">The variation of SFD value with Tan is small as Tan &lt;700 (degree)  C. But it increases rapidly with increasing Tan as Tan &gt;700 (degree)  C. For Tan =900 (degree)  C., the SFD value is about 1.1. For the annealing temperature between 550 (degree)  C. and 800 (degree)  C., the annealed films are all suitable for magnetic recording media if we choose 0.5 and 0.75 as the margins of SFD and S, respectively.</p>
    <p num="30">EXAMPLE 4</p>
    <p num="31">
      The sputtering conditions and the FePt composition were the same as example 1.
      <br/>
      From the observations of TEM images, we found that the average particle size of FePt--Si3 N4 composite film grows more slowly than that of pure FePt film when the annealing temperature is increased.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows the relationships among FePt particle size, Vf, and Tan of various FePt--Si3 N4 films.
      <br/>
      The film thickness is 10 nm and the film is ice-water quenched after the annealing process.
      <br/>
      We can see that at the same Tan, the particle size of FePt in composite FePt--Si3 N4 film is decreased as Vf is increased.
      <br/>
      This is due to the fact that the grain growth of magnetic FePt particle is limited by surrounding Si3 N4 matrix.
      <br/>
      As Tan =600 (degree)  C., the average grain size of pure FePt film is about 90 nm, and it is only about 20 nm in the (FePt)70 --(Si3 N4)30 film.
      <br/>
      As Tan =650 (degree)  C., the average grain size of pure FePt film is about 70 nm, and it is only about 30 nm in the (FePt)60 --(Si3 N4)40 film.
      <br/>
      The effect of Si3 N4 addition is not only changing the film's coercivity but also limiting the grain growth of magnetic FePt phase during annealing.

      The sputtering conditions and the FePt composition were the same as example 1.

      FIG. 6 shows the relationships among Ms, Hc, and Vf of various annealed FePt--Si3 N4 granular films with film thickness of 10 nm, 50 nm, and 200 nm, respectively.
      <br/>
      These films were annealed at 650 (degree)  C. for 30 min and ice-water quenched after annealing.
      <br/>
      It can be seen that the Ms value is independent of the film thickness but decreased linearly with increasing Vf.
      <br/>
      The dependence of the Hc value on film thickness is small.
      <br/>
      However, the variation of Hc value with Vf vibrated like a sine curve.
      <br/>
      The amplitude of this sine curve is decreased as Vf is increased.
      <br/>
      This phenomenon may be due to the fact that the particle size of FePt is decreased with increasing Vf and the stress anisotropy of FePt particles is varied with Vf.

      FIG. 7 shows the M-H loop of the annealed (FePt)60 --(Si3 N4)40 film.
      <br/>
      The applied field is parallel to the film plane.
      <br/>
      The sputtering conditions and the FePt composition were the same as example 1.
      <br/>
      The annealing temperature is 650 (degree)  C. and the annealing time is 30 min.
      <br/>
      We can see that the Hc value of this film is about 4000 Oe and the Ms value is about 450 emu/cm3.
      <br/>
      Comparing FIG. 6 with FIG. 1, it can be seen that the Ms value of (FePt)60 --(Si3 N4)40 film does not change after annealing, however, coercivity of the annealed film is much higher than that of the as-deposited film.

      FIGS. 8(a) and 8(b) are the TEM bright field image and electron diffraction pattern of the annealed (FePt)60 --(Si3 N4)40 film, which was annealed at 650 (degree)  C. for 30 min then ice-water quenched.
      <br/>
      Thickness of the film is 200 nm.
      <br/>
      It is obvious that the spherical FePt particles are dispersed in amorphous Si3 N4 matrix, and they form a typical granular structure.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8(b) reveals that the FePt particle of this film is fct  GAMMA 1 -FePt phase.
      <br/>
      Additionally, when we indexed this diffraction pattern's rings with JCPDS, it was confirmed that the Si3 N4 phase still maintains an amorphous state after annealing at this temperature.
