    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to methods for forming coating films on metallic and polymeric substrates and, more particularly, to composite coatings including a primary layer, basecoat and clearcoat which are applied in a wet-on-wet-on-wet process which when cured provide good chip resistance and a smooth finish.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Over the past decade, there has been a concerted effort to reduce atmospheric pollution caused by volatile solvents which are emitted during the painting process.
      <br/>
      However, it is often difficult to achieve high quality, smooth coating finishes, such as are required in the automotive industry, without using organic solvents, which contribute greatly to flow and leveling of a coating.
      <br/>
      In addition to achieving near-flawless appearance, automotive coatings must be durable and chip resistant, yet economical and easy to apply.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Currently, in the automotive industry the coating system which provides a good balance between economy, appearance and physical properties is a system having four individual coating layers.
      <br/>
      The first coating is a corrosion resistant primer which is applied by electrodeposition and cured.
      <br/>
      The next coating is a primer/surfacer which is spray applied and then cured.
      <br/>
      The third coating is a spray-applied colored basecoat.
      <br/>
      The basecoat is generally not cured before the application of the final coating, the clear coat which is designed to provide toughness and high gloss to the system.
      <br/>
      The process of applying one layer of a coating before the previous layer is cured is referred to as a wet-on-wet ("WOW") application.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,464 discloses a primer which can be dried at ambient conditions for 60 minutes and coated with a waterborne basecoat and two component, low VOC clearcoat (column 7, line 60 to column 8, line 44).
      <br/>
      The primer coating composition includes an aqueous dispersion of a thermoplastic anionic polyacrylate or polyurethane.
      <br/>
      The polyacrylate has functional carboxylic acid or anhydride groups which are neutralized with ammonia.
      <br/>
      The polyurethane is also neutralized with ammonia or an amine to be dispersible in water.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is desirable, however, to use a thermosettable primer/surfacer coating to provide better adhesion to the substrate.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, conventional thermosettable waterborne primer/surfacer compositions need to be cured before the basecoat is applied, increasing cost by requiring major capital investment in ovens and large amounts of energy.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The automotive industry would derive a significant economic advantage from an inexpensive coating process which provides a coated composite having good adhesion, chip resistance and smoothness, yet which can be applied wet-on-wet-on-wet ("WOWOW"), i.e., a process in which the primer/surfacer is not heated or is heated only for a short time at a low temperature to evaporate some of the water and/or solvent remaining in the primer/surfacer after it has been applied without significant crosslinking thereof.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">The present invention provides a method for forming a composite coating comprising the steps of: (A) applying an aqueous primary coating composition to at least a portion of a surface of a substrate, the primary coating composition comprising: (1) at least one thermosettable dispersion comprising polymeric microparticles having functionality adapted to react with a crosslinking material, the microparticles comprising: (a) at least one acid functional reaction product of ethylenically unsaturated monomers; and (b) at least one hydrophobic polymer having a number average molecular weight of at least about 500; and (2) at least one crosslinking material, to form a substantially uncured primary coating thereon; (B) applying a secondary coating composition to at least a portion of the primary coating formed in step (A) without substantially curing the primary coating to form a substantially uncured secondary coating thereon; and (C) applying a clear coating composition to at least a portion of the secondary coating formed in step (B) without substantially curing the secondary coating to form a substantially uncured composite coating thereon.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The method of the present invention provides a composite coating having good smoothness and aesthetic appearance, as well as good adhesion to the substrate and chip resistance.

    <p num="9">
      The shape of the metal substrate can be in the form of a sheet, plate, bar, rod or any shape desired, but is preferably is in the form of an automobile part, such as a body, door, fender, hood or bumper.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the substrate can vary as desired.
      <br/>
      Suitable substrates can be formed from inorganic or metallic materials, thermoset materials, thermoplastic materials and combinations thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The metal substrates coated by the methods of the present invention include ferrous metals such as iron, steel, and alloys thereof, non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, zinc and alloys thereof, and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Most load bearing components of automobile bodies are formed from metal substrates.
      <br/>
      Useful thermoset materials include polyesters, epoxides, phenolics, polyurethanes and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Useful thermoplastic materials include polyolefins, polyamides, thermoplastic polyurethanes, thermoplastic polyesters, acrylic polymers, vinyl polymers, copolymers and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Car parts typically formed from thermoplastic and thermoset materials include bumpers and trim.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to have a coating system which can be applied to both metal and non-metal parts.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      To better understand the aforesaid important aspects of the invention, a metal coating operation in which such methods are useful will be discussed.
      <br/>
      One skilled in the art would understand that the methods of the present invention are not intended to be limited to use in coating metal substrates, but also are useful for coating polymeric substrates as discussed above.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Before depositing the coatings upon the surface of the metal substrate, it is preferred to remove foreign matter from the metal surface by thoroughly cleaning and degreasing the surface by physical or chemical means such as are well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a pretreatment coating, such as BONAZINC zinc-rich pretreatment (commercially available from PPG Industries, Inc.), is deposited upon at least a portion of the surface of the metal substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      An electrodeposited coating is preferably applied to the surface of an electroconductive substrate prior to applying the primary coating composition of step (A), which is discussed in detail below.
      <br/>
      Useful electrodepositable coating compositions include conventional anionic or cationic electrodepositable coating compositions.
      <br/>
      Methods for electrodepositing coatings are well known to those skilled in the art and a detailed discussion thereof is not believed to be necessary.
      <br/>
      Useful compositions and methods are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,530,043 (relating to anionic electrodeposition) and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,760,107; 5,820,987 and 4,933,056 (relating to cationic electrodeposition) which are hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In the methods of the present invention, an aqueous primary coating composition is applied to at least a portion of the substrate (which can be pretreated and/or electrocoated, as discussed above).
      <br/>
      The aqueous primary coating composition comprises, as a film former, at least one thermosettable or crosslinkable dispersion comprising polymeric microparticles having functionality adapted to react with a crosslinking material in an aqueous medium.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term "dispersion" means that the microparticles are capable of being distributed throughout water as finely divided particles, such as a latex.
      <br/>
      See Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, (12th Ed. 1993) at page 435, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      The uniformity of the dispersion can be increased by the addition of wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents (surfactants), which are discussed below.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The microparticles comprise at least one acid functional reaction product (a) of ethylenically unsaturated monomers.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the phrase "acid functional" means that the product (a) can give up a proton to a base in a chemical reaction; a substance that is capable of reacting with a base to form a salt; or a compound that produces hydronium ions, H3 O+, in aqueous solution.
      <br/>
      See Hawley's at page 15 and K. Whitten et al., General Chemistry, (1981) at page 192, which are hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The reaction product (a) is usually formed by polymerizing one or more ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomers (having a carboxyl group(s) as the acid functional group) and one or more other ethylenically unsaturated monomers.</p>
    <p num="17">
      One skilled in the art would understand the criteria for selecting suitable addition polymerizable unsaturated carboxylic acid monomers which are capable of forming a polymer with the other ethylenically unsaturated monomers.
      <br/>
      Such criteria can include, for example, structural characteristics and reactivity rate which are appropriate to form a polymer from the addition polymerizable unsaturated carboxylic acid monomers and the other ethylenically unsaturated monomers.
      <br/>
      Guidance in selecting appropriate addition polymerizable unsaturated carboxylic acids can be found in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 1 (1963) at pages 224-254.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Non-limiting examples of useful ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomers include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acryloxypropionic acid, crotonic acid, fumaric acid, monoalkyl esters of fumaric acid, maleic acid, monoalkyl esters of maleic acid, itaconic acid, monoalkyl esters of itaconic acid and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Preferred ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomers are acrylic acid and methacrylic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Non-limiting examples of useful other ethylenically unsaturated vinyl monomers include alkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids, such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, isobornyl methacrylate and lauryl methacrylate; vinyl aromatics such as styrene and vinyl toluene; acrylamides such as N-butoxymethyl acrylamide; acrylonitriles; dialkyl esters of maleic and fumaric acids; vinyl and vinylidene halides; vinyl acetate; vinyl ethers; allyl ethers; allyl alcohols; derivatives thereof and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Acrylic monomers such as butyl acrylate, lauryl methacrylate, or 2-ethylhexyl acrylate are preferred due to the hydrophobic, low glass transition temperature (Tg) nature of the polymers that they produce.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The reaction product (a) can be formed by free radical-initiated polymerization, preferably in the presence of the hydrophobic polymer (b), which is discussed in detail below.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the reaction product (a) can be polymerized and dispersed as a mixture with the hydrophobic polymer (b) in an aqueous medium by conventional dispersion techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Suitable methods for polymerizing ethylenically unsaturated monomers with themselves and/or other addition polymerizable monomers and preformed polymers are well known to those skilled in the art of polymers and further discussion thereof is not believed to be necessary in view of the present disclosure.
      <br/>
      For example, polymerization of the ethylenically unsaturated monomers can be carried out in bulk, in aqueous or organic solvent solution such as benzene or n-hexane, in emulsion, or in aqueous dispersion.
      <br/>
      Kirk-Othmer, Vol. 1 at page 305.
      <br/>
      The polymerization can be effected by means of a suitable initiator system, including free radical initiators such as benzoyl peroxide or azobisisobutyronitrile, anionic initiation and organometallic initiation.
      <br/>
      Molecular weight can be controlled by choice of solvent or polymerization medium, concentration of initiator or monomer, temperature, and the use of chain transfer agents.
      <br/>
      If additional information is needed, such polymerization methods are disclosed in Kirk-Othmer, Vol. 1 at pages 203-205, 259-297 and 305-307, which are hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The number average molecular weight of the reaction product (a) can range from about 10,000 to about 10,000,000 grams per mole, and preferably about 50,000 to about 500,000 grams per mole.
      <br/>
      The term "molecular weight" refers to a number average molecular weight as determined by gel permeation chromatography using a polystyrene standard.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is not an absolute number average molecular weight which is measured, but a number average molecular weight which is a measure relative to a set of polystyrene standards.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The glass transition temperature of the reaction product (a) can range from about -50 (degree)  C. to about +100 (degree)  C., preferably about 0 (degree)  C. to about +50 (degree)  C. as measured using a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), for example a Perkin Elmer Series 7 Differential Scanning Calorimeter, using a temperature range of about -55 (degree)  C. to about 150 (degree)  C. and a scanning rate of about 20 (degree)  C. per minute.</p>
    <p num="24">The amount of the reaction product (a) ranges from about 10 to about 80 weight percent on a basis of total resin solids weight of the thermosettable dispersion, preferably about 20 to about 60 weight percent, and more preferably about 30 to about 50 weight percent.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The microparticles also comprise one or more hydrophobic polymers.
      <br/>
      As used herein, "hydrophobic polymer" means hydrophobic oligomers, polymers and copolymers.
      <br/>
      The term "hydrophobic", as used herein, means that the polymer essentially is not compatible with, does not have an affinity for and/or is not capable of dissolving in water, i.e., it repels water, and that upon mixing a sample of polymer with an organic component and water, a majority of the polymer is in the organic phase and a separate aqueous phase is observed.
      <br/>
      See Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, (12th Ed. 1993) at page 618.
      <br/>
      In order for the hydrophobic polymer to be substantially hydrophobic the hydrophobic polymer must not contain enough acid or ionic functionality to allow it to form stable dispersions in water.
      <br/>
      The amount of acid functionality in a resin can be measured by acid value, the number of milligrams of KOH per gram of solid required to neutralize the acid functionality in the resin.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the acid value of the hydrophobic polymer is below about 20, more preferably the acid value is below about 10, and most preferably below about 5.
      <br/>
      Hydrophobic polymers having low acid values can be water-dispersible if they contain other hydrophilic components such as poly(ethylene oxide) groups.
      <br/>
      However, such hydrophobic polymers are not substantially hydrophobic if they are water-dispersible, no matter what their acid value is.
    </p>
    <p num="26">The hydrophobic polymer is adapted to be chemically bound into the composite coating when it is cured, i.e., the hydrophobic polymer is reactive in the sense that it contains functional groups such as hydroxyl groups which are capable of coreacting, for example, with a crosslinking agent such as melamine formaldehyde which may be present in the primary coating composition or alternatively with other film forming resins which also can be present.</p>
    <p num="27">
      Preferably, the hydrophobic polymer has a number average molecular weight greater than 500, more preferably greater than 800.
      <br/>
      Typically the molecular weight ranges from about 800 to about 10,000, more usually from about 800 to about 3000.
      <br/>
      The glass transition temperature of the hydrophobic polymer can range from about -50 (degree)  C. to about +50 (degree)  C., and preferably about -25 (degree)  C. to about +25 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The hydrophobic polymer is preferably essentially linear, i. e., it contains a minimal amount of branching for flexibility.
      <br/>
      The hydrophobic polymer preferably is essentially free of repeating acrylic or vinyl units, i.e., the polymer is not prepared from typical free radically polymerizable monomers such as acrylates, styrene and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Non-limiting examples of useful hydrophobic polymers include polyesters, alkyds, polyurethanes, polyethers, polyureas, polyamides, polycarbonates and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="30">
      Suitable polyester resins are derived from polyfunctional acids and polyhydric alcohols.
      <br/>
      Generally, polyester resins contain essentially no oil or fatty acid modification.
      <br/>
      That is, while alkyd resins are in the broadest sense polyester type resins, they are oil-modified and thus not generally referred to as polyester resins.
      <br/>
      Commonly used polyhydric alcohols include 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, neopentyl glycol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, butylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol and sorbitol.
      <br/>
      A saturated acid often will be included in the reaction to provide desirable properties.
      <br/>
      Examples of saturated acids include phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, adipic acid, azeleic acid, sebacic acid and the anhydrides thereof.
      <br/>
      Useful saturated polyesters are derived from saturated or aromatic polyfunctional acids, preferably dicarboxylic acids, and mixtures of polyhydric alcohols having an average hydroxyl functionality of at least 2.
      <br/>
      Mixtures of rigid and flexible diacids are preferable in order to achieve a balance of hardness and flexibility.
      <br/>
      Monocarboxylic acids such as benzoic acid can be used in addition to polycarboxylic acids in order to improve properties or modify the molecular weight or the viscosity of the polyester.
      <br/>
      Dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides such as isophthalic acid, phthalic anhydride, adipic acid, and maleic anhydride are preferred.
      <br/>
      Other useful components of polyesters can include hydroxy acids and lactones such as ricinoleic acids, 12-hydroxystearic acid, caprolactone, butyrolactone and dimethylolpropionic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Polyols having a hydroxyl functionality of two such as neopentylglycol, trimethylpentanediol, or 1,6-hexanediol are preferred.
      <br/>
      Small amounts of polyols with a functionality greater than two such as pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane, or glycerol and monofunctional alcohols such as tridecyl alcohol, in addition to diols, can be used to improve properties of the polyester.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Suitable polyurethane resins can be prepared by reacting a polyol with a polyisocyanate.
      <br/>
      The reaction can be performed with a minor amount of organic polyisocyanate (OH/NCO equivalent ratio greater than 1:1) so that terminal hydroxyl groups are present or alternatively the OH/NCO equivalent ratio can be less than 1:1 thus producing terminal isocyanate groups.
      <br/>
      Preferably the polyurethane resins have terminal hydroxyl groups.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The organic polyisocyanate can be an aliphatic polyisocyanate, including a cycloaliphatic polyisocyanate, or an aromatic polyisocyanate.
      <br/>
      Useful aliphatic polyisocyanates include aliphatic diisocyanates such as ethylene diisocyanate, 1,2-diisocyanatopropane, 1,3-diisocyanatopropane, 1,6-diisocyanatohexane, 1,4-butylene diisocyanate, lysine diisocyanate, 1,4-methylene bis(cyclohexyl isocyanate) and isophorone diisocyanate.
      <br/>
      Useful aromatic diisocyanates and araliphatic diisocyanates include the various isomers of toluene diisocyanate, meta-xylylene diisocyanate and para-xylylene diisocyanate, also 4-chloro-1,3-phenylene diisocyanate, 1,5-tetrahydro-naphthalene diisocyanate, 4,4'-dibenzyl diisocyanate and 1,2,4-benzene triisocyanate can be used.
      <br/>
      In addition the various isomers of alpha, alpha, alpha', alpha'-tetramethyl xylylene diisocyanate can be used.
      <br/>
      Also useful as the polyisocyanate are isocyanurates such as DESMODUR 3300 and biurets of isocyanates such as DESMODUR N100, both of which are commercially available from Bayer, Inc. of Pittsburgh, Pa.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The polyol can be polymeric such as polyester polyols, polyether polyols, polyurethane polyols, etc. or it can be a simple diol or triol such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane or hexanetriol.
      <br/>
      Mixtures can also be utilized.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The polyester or polyurethane can be adapted so that a portion of it can be grafted onto an acrylic and/or vinyl polymer.
      <br/>
      That is, the polyester or polyurethane can be chemically bound to an ethylenically unsaturated component that is capable of undergoing free radical copolymerization with acrylic and/or vinyl monomers.
      <br/>
      One means of making the polyester or polyurethane graftable is by including in its composition an ethylenically unsaturated acid or anhydride such as crotonic acid, maleic anhydride, or methacrylic anhydride.
      <br/>
      For example, an isocyanate-functional 1:1 adduct of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and isophorone diisocyanate can be reacted with hydroxyl functionality in the polyurethane to make it copolymerizable with acrylic monomers.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Useful alkyd resins include polyesters of polyhydroxyl alcohols and polycarboxylic acids chemically combined with various drying, semi-drying and non-drying oils in different proportions.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, the alkyd resins are made from polycarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, isophthalic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, azeleic acid, sebacic acid as well as from anhydrides of such acids, where they exist.
      <br/>
      The polyhydric alcohols which can be reacted with the polycarboxylic acid include 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, neopentyl glycol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol and 2,3-butylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, sorbitol and mannitol.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The alkyd resins are produced by reacting the polycarboxylic acid and the polyhydric alcohol together with a drying, semi-drying or non-drying oil in proportions depending upon the properties desired.
      <br/>
      The oils are coupled into the resin molecule by esterification during manufacturing and become an integral part of the polymer.
      <br/>
      The oil is fully saturated or predominately unsaturated.
      <br/>
      When cast into films, fully saturated oils tend to give a plasticizing effect to the film, whereas predominately unsaturated oils tend to crosslink and dry rapidly with oxidation to give more tough and solvent resistant films.
      <br/>
      Suitable oils include coconut oil, fish oil, linseed oil, tung oil, castor oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, and tall oil.
      <br/>
      Various proportions of the polycarboxylic acid, polyhydric alcohol and oil are used to obtain alkyd resins of various properties as is well known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Examples of useful polyethers are polyalkylene ether polyols which include those having the following structural formulae:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="39">
      where the substituent R is hydrogen or lower alkyl containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms including mixed substituents, n is an integer typically ranging from 2 to 6 and m is an integer ranging from 10 to 100 or even higher.
      <br/>
      Non-limiting examples of useful polyalkylene ether polyols include poly(oxytetramethylene) glycols, poly(oxy-1,2-propylene) glycols and poly(oxy-1,2-butylene) glycols.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Also useful are polyether polyols formed from oxyalkylation of various polyols, for example, glycols such as ethylene glycol, 1,6-hexanediol, Bisphenol A and the like, or other higher polyols, such as trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol and the like.
      <br/>
      Polyols of higher functionality which can be utilized as indicated can be made, for example, by oxyalkylation of compounds such as sorbitol or sucrose.
      <br/>
      One commonly utilized oxyalkylation method is by reacting a polyol with an alkylene oxide, for example, ethylene or propylene oxide, in the presence of an acidic or basic catalyst.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      With polyether polyols, it is preferred that the carbon to oxygen weight ratio be high for better hydrophobic properties.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is preferred that the carbon to oxygen ratio be greater than 3/1 and more preferably greater than 4/1.

      The hydrophobic polymer of the polymeric microparticles can optionally contain other components included to modify certain of its properties.
      <br/>
      For example, the hydrophobic polymer can contain urea or amide functionality to improve adhesion.
      <br/>
      Suitable urea functional hydrophobic polymers include acrylic polymers having pendant urea groups, which can be prepared by copolymerizing acrylic monomers with urea functional vinyl monomers such as urea functional alkyl esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid.
      <br/>
      An example includes the condensation product of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with a hydroxyalkyl ethylene urea such as hydroxyethyl ethylene urea.
      <br/>
      Other urea functional monomers include, for example, the reaction product of hydroxyethyl methacrylate, isophorone diisocyanate and hydroxyethyl ethylene urea.
      <br/>
      Mixed pendant carbamate and urea groups can also be used.

      In a preferred embodiment, the dispersion of polymeric microparticles in an aqueous medium is prepared by a high stress technique which is described more fully below.
      <br/>
      First, the ethylenically unsaturated monomers utilized to prepare the microparticle are thoroughly mixed with the aqueous medium and the hydrophobic polymer.
      <br/>
      For the present application, the ethylenically unsaturated monomers together with the hydrophobic polymer are referred to as the organic component.
      <br/>
      The organic component generally also comprises other organic species and preferably is substantially free of organic solvent, i.e., no more than 20 percent of organic solvent is present.
      <br/>
      The mixture is then subjected to stress in order to particulate it into microparticles which are uniformly of a fine particle size.
      <br/>
      The mixture is subjected to stress sufficient to result in a dispersion such that after polymerization less than 20 percent of the polymer microparticles have a mean diameter greater than 5 microns.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The aqueous medium provides the continuous phase of dispersion in which the microparticles are suspended.
      <br/>
      The aqueous medium is generally exclusively water.
      <br/>
      However, for some polymer systems, it can be desirable to also include a minor amount of inert organic solvent which can assist in lowering the viscosity of the polymer to be dispersed.
      <br/>
      For example, if the organic phase has a Brookfield viscosity greater than 1000 centipoise at 25 (degree)  C. or a W Gardner Holdt viscosity, some solvent can be used.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable solvents which can be incorporated in the organic component are benzyl alcohol, xylene, methyl isobutyl ketone, mineral spirits, butanol, butyl acetate, tributyl phosphate and dibutyl phthalate.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      As was mentioned above, the mixture is subjected to the appropriate stress by use of a MICROFLUIDIZER.RTM. emulsifier which is available from Microfluidics Corporation in Newton, Mass.
      <br/>
      The MICROFLUIDIZER.RTM. high pressure impingement emulsifier is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,533,254, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      The device consists of a high pressure (up to about 1.4 * 105 kPa (20,000 psi)) pump and an interaction chamber in which emulsification takes place.
      <br/>
      The pump forces the mixture of reactants in aqueous medium into the chamber where it is split into at least two streams which pass at very high velocity through at least two slits and collide, resulting in the particulation of the mixture into small particles.
      <br/>
      Generally, the reaction mixture is passed through the emulsifier once at a pressure of between about 3.5 * 104 and about 1 * 105 kPa (5,000 and 15,000 psi).
      <br/>
      Multiple passes can result in smaller average particle size and a narrower range for the particle size distribution.
      <br/>
      When using the aforesaid MICROFLUIDIZER.RTM. emulsifier, stress is applied by liquid-liquid impingement as has been described.
      <br/>
      However, it should be understood that, if desired, other modes of applying stress to the pre-emulsification mixture can be utilized so long as sufficient stress is applied to achieve the requisite particle size distribution, that is, such that after polymerization less than 20 percent of the polymer microparticles have a mean diameter greater than 5 microns.
      <br/>
      For example, one alternative manner of applying stress would be the use of ultrasonic energy.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Stress is described as force per unit area.
      <br/>
      Although the precise mechanism by which the MICROFLUIDIZER.RTM. emulsifier stresses the pre-emulsification mixture to particulate it is not thoroughly understood, it is theorized that stress is exerted in more than one manner.
      <br/>
      It is believed that one manner in which stress is exerted is by shear.
      <br/>
      Shear means that the force is such that one layer or plane moves parallel to an adjacent, parallel plane.
      <br/>
      Stress can also be exerted from all sides as a bulk, compression stress.
      <br/>
      In this instance stress could be exerted without any shear.
      <br/>
      A further manner of producing intense stress is by cavitation.
      <br/>
      Cavitation occurs when the pressure within a liquid is reduced enough to cause vaporization.
      <br/>
      The formation and collapse of the vapor bubbles occurs violently over a short time period and produces intense stress.
      <br/>
      Although not intending to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that both shear and cavitation contribute to producing the stress which particulates the pre-emulsification mixture.

    <p num="51">
      Once the mixture has been particulated into microparticles, the polymerizable species within each particle are polymerized under conditions sufficiently to produce polymer microparticles which are stably dispersed in the aqueous medium.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a surfactant or dispersant is present to stabilize the dispersion.
      <br/>
      The surfactant is preferably present when the organic component referred to above is mixed into the aqueous medium prior to particulation.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the surfactant can be introduced into the medium at a point just after the particulation within the MICROFLUIDIZER.RTM. emulsifier.
      <br/>
      The surfactant, however, can be an important part of the particle forming process and is often necessary to achieve the requisite dispersion stability.
      <br/>
      The surfactant can be a material whose role is to prevent the emulsified particles from agglomerating to form larger particles.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Examples of suitable surfactants include the dimethylethanolamine salt of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate, ethoxylated nonylphenol and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate.

      Other materials well known to those skilled in the art are also suitable herein.
      <br/>
      Generally, both ionic and non-ionic surfactants are used together and the amount of surfactant ranges from about 1 percent to about 10 percent, preferably from about 2 percent to about 4 percent, the percentage based on the total solids.
      <br/>

      In order to conduct the polymerization of the ethylenically unsaturated monomers, a free radical initiator is usually present.
      <br/>
      Both water soluble and oil soluble initiators can be used.
      <br/>
      Since the addition of certain initiators, such as redox initiators, can result in a strong exothermic reaction, it is generally desirable to add the initiator to the other ingredients immediately before the reaction is to be conducted.
      <br/>
      Examples of water soluble initiators include ammonium peroxydisulfate, potassium peroxydisulfate and hydrogen peroxide.
      <br/>
      Examples of oil soluble initiators include t-butyl hydroperoxide, dilauryl peroxide, t-butyl perbenzoate and 2,2'-azobis(isobutyronitrile).

      The length of time required to complete polymerization typically varies from about 10 minutes to about 6 hours.

      The progress of the polymerization reaction can be followed by techniques conventionally known to those skilled in the art of polymer chemistry.

      The aqueous microparticle dispersions can be prepared by a batch process or a continuous process.
      <br/>
      In one example of a batch process, the unreacted microdispersion is fed over a period of about 1 to 4 hours into a heated reactor initially charged with water.
      <br/>
      The initiator can be fed in simultaneously, it can be part of the microdispersion or it can be charged to the reactor before feeding in the microdispersion.
      <br/>
      The optimum temperature depends upon the specific initiator being used.

      The length of time typically ranges from about 2 hours to about 6 hours.

      In an alternative batch process, a reactor vessel is charged with the entire amount of microdispersion to be polymerized.

      Polymerization commences when an appropriate initiator such as a redox initiator is added.
      <br/>
      An appropriate initial temperature is chosen such that the heat of polymerization does not increase the batch temperature beyond the boiling point of the ingredients.
      <br/>
      Thus for large scale production, it is preferred that the microdispersion have sufficient heat capacity to absorb the total amount of heat being generated.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      In a continuous process, the pre-emulsion or mixture of raw materials is passed through the homogenizer to make a microdispersion which is immediately passed through a heated tube, e.g., stainless steel, or a heat exchanger in which polymerization takes place.

      The initiator is added to the microdispersion just before it enters the tubing.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      It is preferred to use redox type initiators in the continuous process since other initiators can produce gases such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide which can cause the latex to spurt out of the reaction tubing prematurely.

      The aqueous medium, therefore, is substantially free of water soluble polymer.
      <br/>
      The resultant polymer microparticles are, of course, insoluble in the aqueous medium.

      As used herein, "substantially free" means that the aqueous medium contains no more than 30 percent by weight of dissolved polymer, preferably no more than 15 percent.

      By "stably dispersed" is meant that the polymer microparticles do not settle upon standing and do not coagulate or flocculate on standing.

    </p>
    <p num="64">
      As was stated above, a very important aspect of the polymer microparticle dispersions is that the particle size is uniformly small, i.e., after polymerization less than 20 percent of the polymer microparticles have a mean diameter which is greater than 5 microns, more preferably greater than 1 micron.

      Generally, the microparticles have a mean diameter from about 0.01 microns to about 10 microns.

      They can also be prepared at a lower solids level of about 30 to about 40 percent total solids and concentrated to a higher level of solids of about 55 to about 65 percent by stripping.
