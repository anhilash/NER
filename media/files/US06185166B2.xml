      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention generally relates to optical information recording/reproducing apparatuses, and more particularly to an optical information recording/reproducing apparatus which optically records information on a recording medium and/or optically reproduces the information from the recording medium.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      An optical disk unit is an example of a unit which uses an optical information recording/reproducing apparatus.
      <br/>
      The optical disk unit can be used as a storage unit of a file system or the like, and is suited for storing programs and large amounts of data.
      <br/>
      In such an optical disk unit, it is desirable that an optical system thereof can accurately record and/or reproduce the information, and that the number of parts thereof is minimized so as to reduce the cost of the optical disk unit as a whole.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Various techniques have been proposed to detect a focal error in the optical disk unit.
      <br/>
      Generally, the astigmatism technique and the Foucault technique are well known.
      <br/>
      The Foucault technique is sometimes also referred to as the double knife edge technique.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Compared to the astigmatism technique, the Foucault technique is less affected by the external disturbance that occurs when a track on an optical disk is traversed, the birefringence of the optical disk.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the mixture of the external disturbance into a focal error signal when the Foucault technique is employed is extremely small compared to the case where the astigmatism technique is employed.
      <br/>
      In addition, the Foucault technique detects a reflected light beam from the optical disk by a photodetector which is arranged in a vicinity of an image formation point of the optical beam, and for this reason, an abnormal offset is unlikely generated in the focal error signal even if the reflected light beam shifts from an optical axis.
      <br/>
      Because of these advantageous features obtainable by the Foucault technique, it is desirable to employ the Foucault technique as the focal error detection technique.
    </p>
    <p num="8">First, an example of an optical information recording/reproducing apparatus within a conventional magneto-optic disk unit which employs the Foucault technique will be described with reference to FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In an optical system of the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 1, a laser beam which is emitted from a laser diode 201 is formed into a parallel beam having an oval cross section in a collimator lens 202, and is thereafter formed into a light beam having a circular cross section in a true circle correction prism 203.
      <br/>
      The light beam from the true circle correction prism. 203 is transmitted through a beam splitter 204, reflected by a mirror 205, and is converged on a disk 207 via an objective lens 206.
      <br/>
      A reflected light beam from the disk 207 enters the beam splitter 204 via the objective lens 206 and the mirror 205, but this time the reflected light beam is reflected by the beam splitter 204 and is directed towards a beam splitter 208.
      <br/>
      The beam splitter 208 splits the reflected light beam into two light beams, and supplies one light beam to a magneto-optic signal detection system and the other light beam to a servo signal detection system.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The magneto-optic signal detection system includes a Wollaston prism 209, a lens 210 and a 2-part photodetector 211.
      <br/>
      One of the two light beams output from the beam splitter 208 is input to the 2-part photodetector 211 via the Wollaston prism 209 and the lens 210, and the 2-part photodetector 211 detects the magneto-optic signal, that is, the information signal, based on the input light beam.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The servo signal detection system includes a condenser lens 212, a beam splitter 213, a 2-part photodetector 214, a composite prism 215 and a 4-part photodetector 216.
      <br/>
      The other of the two light beams output from the beam splitter 208 is input to the 2-part photodetector 214 via the condenser lens 212 and the beam splitter 213 on one hand, and is input to the 4-part photodetector 216 via the composite prism 215 on the other.
      <br/>
      The 2-part photodetector 214 forms a tracking error detection system in the servo signal detection system, and generates a tracking error signal by obtaining a difference between the outputs of the 2-part photodetector 214 according to the push-pull technique.
      <br/>
      The composite prism 215 and the 4-part photodetector 216 form a focal error detection system in the servo signal detection system, and generates a focal error signal based on outputs of the 4-part photodetector 216 according to the Foucault technique.
      <br/>
      A focus servo operation controls the relative positional relationship of the objective lens 206 and the disk 207 based on the focal error signal, so that an in-focus position is located on the disk 207.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Next, a description will be given of the push-pull technique, by referring to FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) show the relative positional relationship of the light beam which is irradiated via the objective lens 206 and the track on the disk 207, and FIGS. 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) show a spot of the reflected light beam which is formed on the 2-part photodetector 214 in correspondence with FIGS. 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c).
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      FIG. 2(b) shows a case where the spot of the light beam is positioned at the center of a guide groove 207a of the disk 207.
      <br/>
      In this case, the spot of the reflected light beam on the 2-part photodetector 214 is formed as shown in FIG. 3(b), and a light intensity distribution b is symmetrical to the right and left.
      <br/>
      If the outputs of the 2-part photodetector 214 are denoted by A and B, a tracking error signal TES is generated based on the following formula (1).
    </p>
    <p num="14">TES=A-B   (1)</p>
    <p num="15">In this case, the tracking error signal TES is 0.</p>
    <p num="16">
      If the spot of the light beam in FIG. 2(b) shifts to the right as shown in FIG. 2(a), a light intensity distribution a of the reflected light beam becomes unbalanced and the light intensity at the left detector part of the 2-part photodetector 214 becomes larger as shown in FIG. 3(a).
      <br/>
      For this reason, the tracking error signal TES in this case takes a positive value.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      On the other hand, if the spot of the light beam in FIG. 2(b) shifts to the left as shown in FIG. 2(c), a light intensity distribution c of the reflected light beam becomes unbalanced and the light intensity at the right detector part of the 2-part photodetector 214 becomes larger as shown in FIG. 3(c).
      <br/>
      For this reason, the tracking error signal TES in this case takes a negative value.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Accordingly, if the spot of the light beam on the disk 207 shifts to the right or left with respect to the central position of the guide groove 207a, the tracking error signal TES which is obtained in the above described manner changes to a more positive or negative value.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to carry out an appropriate tracking control operation based on the tracking error signal TES.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 4 shows an example of the shapes of the composite prism 215 and the 4-part photodetector 216.
      <br/>
      The 4-part photodetector 216 includes detector parts 216a, 216b, 216c and 216d.
      <br/>
      A focal error signal FES is generated from outputs A, B, C and D respectively output from the detector parts 216a, 216b, 216c and 216d of the 4-part photodetector 216, based on the following formula (2).
    </p>
    <p num="20">FES=(A-B)+(C-D)   (2)</p>
    <p num="21">
      Ideally, the focal error signal FES is 0 in a state where the spot of the light beam is in focus on the disk 207.
      <br/>
      In this case, the focal error signal FES having an S-curve as shown in FIG. 5 is obtained depending on the distance between the objective lens 206 and the disk 207.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5, the ordinate indicates the focal error signal FES, and the abscissa indicates the distance between the objective lens 206 and the disk 207.
      <br/>
      The origin (0) on the abscissa corresponds to the in-focus position, and the above distance becomes smaller towards the left and larger towards the right in FIG. 5.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      FIGS. 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c) show the relative positional relationship of the objective lens 206 and the disk 207.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6(a) shows a case where the objective lens 206 is close to the disk 207 and the in-focus position is located above the disk 207 in the figure, FIG. 6(b) shows a case where the in-focus position is located on the disk 207, and FIG. 6(c) shows a case where the objective lens 296 is far from the disk 207 and the in-focus position is located between the disk 207 and the objective lens 206 in the figure.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      FIGS. 7(a), 7(b) and 7(c) show beam spots on the 4-part photodetector 216 for each relative positional relationship of the objective lens 206 and the disk 207 shown in FIGS. 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c).
      <br/>
      FIG. 7(a) shows the beam spots for the positional relationship shown in FIG. 6(a), FIG. 7(b) shows the beam spots for the in-focus positional relationship shown in FIG. 6(b), and FIG. 7(c) shows the beam spots for the positional relationship shown in FIG. 6(c).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 7(b), the beam spots on the 4-part photodetector 216 have oval shapes in the in-focus position, and a division line E of the 4-part photodetector 216 is positioned at the center of each oval beam spot.
    </p>
    <p num="24">However, in the actual disk unit, the distribution of the quantity of the light beam irradiated on the disk 207 may be unbalanced, and errors may exist in the mounting positions of the composite prism 215 and the 4-part photodetector 216.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The light intensity distribution of the light beam which is emitted from the laser diode 201 can generally be approximated by a Gaussian distribution.
      <br/>
      Hence, if the optical axis of the light beam emitted from the laser diode 201 matches the optical axes of other optical parts, it is possible to obtain a Gaussian distribution in which the center of the light intensity of the light beam input to the objective lens 206 matches the optical axis (point 0) shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      However, if the light beam emitted from the laser diode 201 is inclined by an angle  THETA  in FIG. 1, the center of the light intensity of the light beam input to the objective lens 206 is shifted from the optical axis (point 0) in the Gaussian distribution as indicated by a dotted line in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The "unbalanced distribution" of the light quantity of the light beam irradiated on the disk 207 or "decentering", refers to such a difference between the optical axis and the center of light beam intensity distribution.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      On the other hand, the "mounting error" of the composite prism 215, for example, refers to a positional error of the composite prism 215 in a y-direction in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      If such a mounting error exists, the composite prism 215 cannot accurately split the incident light beam into two equal light beams.
      <br/>
      Generally, if the division line E of the composite prism 215 shifts a distance  DELTA y in the y-direction from the center of the incident light beam, where the division line E extends in the x-direction in FIG. 4, the value of the mounting error can be obtained from � DELTA y/(diameter of light beam)� * 100 (%).
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      For this reason, if the quantity of the light beam which is split into two in the composite prism 215 changes and a positional error of the division line E of the 4-part photodetector 216 occurs, a focal offset is generated.
      <br/>
      The generation of the "focal offset" means that the focal error signal FES described by the formula (2) becomes 0 at a position other than the in-focus position.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to the conventional Foucault technique, the tolerable margin of the focal error detection system is extremely small with respect to the unbalanced distribution of the quantity of light beam irradiated on the disk 207, the mounting error of the composite prism 215 and the 4-part photodetector 216 and the like.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a problem in that it is extremely difficult to obtain an accurate focal error signal due to the above error factors.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="28">Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a novel and useful optical information recording/reproducing apparatus in which the problem described above is eliminated.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Another and more specific object of the present invention is to provide an optical information recording/reproducing apparatus which records information on and/or reproduces information from an optical recording medium and detects a focal error based on a reflected light beam from the optical recording medium, comprising a composite prism deflecting a part of the reflected light beam to at least two positions excluding a central part of the reflected light beam, and photodetector means including a plurality of photodetectors for respectively detecting the deflected parts of the reflected light beam and outputting detection outputs, where the focal error is detected based on the detection outputs of the photodetector means.
      <br/>
      According to the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to obtain an accurate focal error signal because the tolerable margin of the focal error detection system can be set large with respect to the unbalanced distribution of the quantity of the light beam irradiated on the optical recording medium, the mounting error of the composite prism, the photodetector and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Still another object of the present invention is to provide an optical information recording/reproducing apparatus which records information on and/or reproduces information from an optical recording medium and detects a tracking error and a focal error based on a reflected light beam from the optical recording medium, comprising beam splitter means for splitting the reflected light beam into at least one first beam which is used for detecting the tracking error and at least two second beams which are used for detecting the focal error, and photodetector means including a first photodetector which detects the first beam at a position other than an image formation point of the first beam, and second photodetectors for detecting the second beams approximately at image formation points of the second beams.
      <br/>
      According to the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus of the present invention, it is unnecessary to provide two independent optical paths even if the focal error is to be detected according to the Foucault technique and the tracking error is to be detected according to the push-pull technique.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is possible to reduce the space occupied by the optical system within the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus, and to reduce the number of required parts.
      <br/>
      For this reason, it is possible to reduce both the size and cost of the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus and an optical disk unit to which the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus may be applied.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      A further object of the present invention is to provide an optical information recording/reproducing apparatus which records information on and/or reproduces information from an optical recording medium and detects a focal error and a tracking error based on a reflected light beam from the optical recording medium, comprising beam splitter means for splitting the reflected light beam into first through fourth light beams which propagate generally in a predetermined direction, and photodetector means for detecting the focal error in response to the first and second light beams, and for detecting the tracking error in response to the third and fourth light beams.
      <br/>
      According to the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to improve the reliability of the focal error detection and tracking error detection.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is possible to reduce both the size and cost of the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus and an optical disk unit to which the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus may be applied.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Another object of the present invention is to provide an optical information recording/reproducing apparatus which records an information signal on and/or reproduces the information signal from an optical recording medium and detects a tracking error, a focal error, the information signal and an address signal based on a reflected light beam from the optical recording medium, comprising beam splitter means for splitting the reflected light beam into first through sixth light beams which propagate generally in a predetermined direction, and photodetector means for detecting the focal error in response to the first and second light beams, and for detecting the tracking error, the information signal and the address signal in response to the third through sixth light beams.
      <br/>
      According to the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to detect the focal error signal, the tracking error signal, the information signal and the address signal by the single photodetector means.
      <br/>
      For this reason, it is possible to detect all of the necessary signals using a single optical path to the beam splitter means and the single photodetector means.
      <br/>
      Hence, it is possible to reduce both the size and cost of the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus and an optical disk unit to which the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus may be applied.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Still another object of the present invention is to provide an optical information recording/reproducing apparatus which records information on and/or reproduces information from an optical recording medium based on a reflected light beam from the optical recording medium, comprising a light splitting part having a plurality of light splitting stages which split the reflected light beam from the optical recording medium into a plurality of light beams, and a photodetector unit including a plurality of photodetectors which receive the plurality of light beams from the light splitting part, where the photodetector unit includes a plurality of photodetectors which receive light beams used to detect a focal error, at least one photodetector which receives a light beam used to detect a tracking error, and a plurality of photodetectors which receive light beams used to detect magneto-optic information recorded on the optical recording medium.
      <br/>
      According to the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus of the present invention, the number of optical parts forming the apparatus can be effectively reduced, thereby simplifying the production process and reducing the cost of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      Further, it is possible to suppress noise and obtain a focal error signal, a tracking error signal and a magneto-optic signal having a high signal quality.

      That is, distances L1 and L2 from the condenser lens 212 to the image formation points 300a and 300b of the respective light beams 30a and 30b are different from a distance L3 from the condenser lens 212 to the image formation point 300c of the light beam 30c.

      For example, an analyzer 21 disclosed in a Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 63-127436 may be used as the analyzer 208A.

      In this eighth embodiment, the light beam is split into three light beams by the analyzer 208A, and each of the three light beams are further split into three light beams by the composite prism 35, thereby resulting in nine (3 * 3=9) light beams being output from the composite prism 35.
      <br/>
      The nine light beams from the composite prism 35 are irradiated on corresponding ones of nine photodetectors 66a through 66i which form the photodetector unit 66.

    <p num="89">
      FIG. 26 shows a plan view of the photodetector unit 66.
      <br/>
      The focal error signal FES can be generated according to the Foucault technique based on outputs of the photodetectors 66a, 66b, 66d, 66e, 66g and 66h of the photodetector unit 66.

      On the other hand, the tracking error signal TES can be generated according to the push-pull technique based on outputs of the photodetectors 66c, 66f and 66i.

      Accordingly, if the outputs of these photodetector parts 37a through 37i are denoted by the same reference numerals as these parts, the focal error signal FES using the Foucault technique can be generated based on any one of the following formulas (3a) through (3d) by calculation.

    <p num="91">The focal error signal FES obtained by the formula (3 a) has a high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and is uneasily affected by external disturbances because all of the beams irradiated on the photodetector unit 66 is used and consequently a large amount of light is used to detect the focal error signal FES.</p>
    <p num="92">On the other hand, the focal error signal FES obtained by the formula (3b) or (3c) enables easy and simple adjustments since only two beams are used to detect the focal error signal FES and thus only two beams need to be irradiated on corresponding two photodetectors 66a and 66h or, 66b and 66g, of the photodetector unit 66 so that each beam irradiates a division line separating the two photodetector parts forming each of the photodetectors 66a and 66h or, 66b and 66g.</p>

      Furthermore, the focal error signal FES obtained by the formula (3d) can obtain, to a certain extent, the above described effects obtainable with respect to the focal error signals FES obtained by the formulas (3a) and (3b) or (3c).

      In addition, in the case of the focal error signal FES obtained by the formula (3d), the required adjustments are simpler compared to the case of the focal error signal FES obtained by the formula (3a).

      Moreover, the focal error signal FES obtained by the formula (3d) has a higher S/N ratio and is less affected by external disturbances as compared to the focal error signal FES obtained by the formulas (3b) or (3c).

      The identification signal ID can be reproduced based on the following formula (6) by calculation.

    <p num="106">In this first modification of the eighth embodiment, a photodetector unit 66A shown in FIG. 27 is used in place of the photodetector unit 66 shown in FIG. 25.</p>
    <p num="107">
      FIG. 28 shows a plan view of the photodetector unit 66A.

      As shown in FIG. 28, the photodetector unit 66A includes 2-part photodetectors 66A-1, 66A-2 and 66A-3, and photodetectors 66A-4 and 66A-5.
      <br/>
      The 2-part photodetector 66A-1 includes photodetector parts A and B. The 2-part photodetector 66A-2 includes photodetector parts C and D. The 2-part photodetector 66A-3 includes photodetector parts E and F. The photodetector 66A-4 includes a photodetector part G, and the photodetector 66A-5 includes a photodetector part H.
    </p>
    <p num="108">Accordingly, if the outputs of these photodetector parts A through H are denoted by the same reference characters as these parts, the focal error signal FES using the Foucault technique can be generated based on the following formula (7) by calculation.</p>

    <p num="110">The focal error signal FES according to the above described formula (7) can be generated by use of known adders and subtracter.</p>
    <p num="111">In addition, the tracking error signal TES using the push-pull technique can be generated based on the following formula (8) by calculation.</p>
    <p num="112">TES=E-F   (8)</p>
    <p num="113">The tracking error signal TES according to the above described formula (8) can be generated by use of a known subtracter.</p>
    <p num="114">Furthermore, by the function of the analyzer 208A, the magneto-optic signal MO which is recorded on the disk 207 can be reproduced based on the following formula (9) by calculation.</p>
    <p num="115">MO=G-H   (9)</p>
    <p num="116">The magneto-optic signal MO according to the above described formula (9) can be generated by use of a known subtracter.</p>

    <p num="118">ID=G+H   (10)</p>
    <p num="119">The identification signal ID according to the above described formula (10) can be generated by use of a known adder.</p>
    <p num="120">
      As may be seen from FIG. 28 and the formulas (7) through (10) described above, this first modification of the eighth embodiment can obtain the focal error signal FES, the tracking error signal TES, the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID by use of a smaller number of photodetectors (or photodetector parts) and a smaller number of adders as compared to the eighth embodiment.
      <br/>
      Hence, due to the smaller number of photodetectors (or photodetector parts) used, a stray capacitance of the photodetectors can be reduced compared to the eighth embodiment.
      <br/>
      In addition, due to the smaller number of adders used, a noise generated by the adders within a large scale integrated circuit (LSI) can be reduced compared to the eighth embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      Compared to servo signals such as the focal error signal FES and the tracking error signal TES, the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID require higher frequency bands, and consequently, higher signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios.
      <br/>
      The stray capacitance and noise described above affect the S/N ratios of the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID, however, this first modification of the eighth embodiment can further improve the S/N ratios of the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID compared to the eighth embodiment due to the smaller number of photodetectors (or photodetector parts) and the smaller number of adders used to reproduce these signals MO and ID.

    <p num="136">Next, a description will be given of a ninth embodiment of the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus according to the present invention, by referring to FIGS. 32 and 33. In FIGS. 32 and 33, those parts which are the same as those corresponding parts in FIG. 19 are designated by the same reference numerals, and a description thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="137">In this embodiment, a holographic optical element 75 shown in FIG. 32 is used in place of the composite prism 35 shown in FIG. 19.</p>
    <p num="138">
      FIG. 32 is a perspective view showing an important part of this embodiment on an enlarged scale.
      <br/>
      The holographic optical element 75 includes first and second parts 75a and 75b.
      <br/>
      The cross sectional shape of the first part 75a along a line A-A' in FIG. 32 is a sawtooth grating as shown in FIG. 33. The second part 75b has a cross sectional shape similar to that of the first part 75a, but the cross sectional shape of the second part 75b is in point symmetry to that of the first part 75a with respect to the center of the holographic optical element 75.
      <br/>
      The sawtooth gratings of the first and second parts 75a and 75b are sometimes also referred to as blazed gratings.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      The holographic optical element 75 separates the reflected light beam 30 into 0th order diffracted light,  +- 1st order diffracted lights, and high-order diffracted lights of  +- 2nd order or higher.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the cross sectional shape of the holographic optical element 75 is designed so that the effect of high-order diffracted lights of  +- 2nd order or higher are small when detecting the light.
      <br/>
      With regard to the  +- 1st order diffracted lights, the above described sawtooth cross sectional shapes of the first and second parts 75a and 75b are designed so that, for example, the quantity of the emitted +1st order diffracted light is larger than that of the emitted -1st order diffracted light, that is, so that the effects of the -1st order diffracted light which is a divergent ray is minimized.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      Accordingly, this embodiment uses a +1st order diffracted light 30-1 which is diffracted by the grating of the first part 75a, a +1st order diffracted light 30-2 which is diffracted by the grating of the second part 75b, and a 0th order diffracted light 30-3 which passes through the first and second parts 75a and 75b without being affected by the gratings thereof.
      <br/>
      In addition, the grating patterns of the first and second parts 75a and 75b are designed such that the +1st order diffracted light 30-1 which is emitted from the first part 75a is refracted twice via the condenser lens 212 and the first part 75a before being imaged at an image formation point 300a, and the +1st order diffracted light 30-2 which is emitted from the second part 75b is refracted twice via the condenser lens 212 and the second part 75b before being imaged at an image formation point 300b.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, since the 0th order diffracted light 30-3 passes through the holographic optical element 75 as it is without being affected by the grating patterns, the 0th order diffracted light 30-3 is refracted only by the condenser lens 212 and is imaged at an image formation point 300c.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      In FIG. 32, the photodetector unit 36 is arranged on a plane which is perpendicular to the optical axis of the reflected light beam and includes the image formation points 300a and 300b.
      <br/>
      Because of this arrangement, the first and second photodetectors 36a and 36b which are used to generate the focal error signal FES based on the Foucault technique are respectively provided at the positions of the image formation points 300a and 300b of the +1st order diffracted lights 30-1 and 30-2.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the third photodetector 36c which is used to generate the tracking error signal TES based on the push-pull technique is provided at a position deviated from the position of the image formation point 300c of the 0th order diffracted light 30-3.
      <br/>
      Hence, it is possible to generate the focal error signal FES using the Foucault technique and to generate the tracking error signal TES using the push-pull technique by use of a simple optical system.
      <br/>
      The generation itself of the focal error signal FES and the tracking error signal TES may be made similarly to the prior art, and a description thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="142">The requirement is that the distances L1 and L2 between the condenser lens 212 and the respective image formation points 300a and 300b of the +1st order diffracted lights 30-1 and 30-2 are different from the distance L3 between the condenser lens 212 and the image formation point 300c of the 0th order diffracted light 30-3, and the construction and arrangement of the holographic optical element 75 and the photodetector unit 36 are not limited to those of this embodiment.</p>
    <p num="143">Next, a description will be given of the functions of the holographic optical element 75 by itself, that is, for the case where no condenser lens 212 exists, by referring to FIGS. 34 through 36.</p>
    <p num="144">
      As described above, the holographic optical element 75 includes the first and second parts 75a and 75b which are provided with independent patterns for deflecting, converging and diverging the light.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the patterns of the first and second parts 75a and 75b are respectively set so that the +1st order diffracted light 30-1 from the first part 75a converges to a point P'(-x, 0 ) and the +1st order diffracted light 30-2 from the second part 75b converges to a point P(x, 0 ).
      <br/>
      Points P and P' are located on a plane x which is a distance f away from the holographic optical element 75 along the optical axis.
      <br/>
      In other words, the function of the first part 75a is to image the parallel incident light at a focal point 0 at a focal distance f, and to converge the light to the point P' by deflecting the light by a distance x in the negative x-direction.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      FIG. 35 shows a plan view of the holographic optical element 75.
      <br/>
      Since the patterns of the first and second parts 75a and 75b are in point symmetry with respect to the origin 0 in FIG. 35, the pattern of the first part 75a, for example, is made up of concentric grooves or projections having a center at the point P'(-x, 0).
      <br/>
      A radius ri of an ith concentric groove or projection can be obtained from the following formula (12), where  LAMBDA  denotes the wavelength of the light output from the light source.
      <br/>
      ri =(2 * f *  LAMBDA  * i+L   (12)
    </p>
    <p num="146">In addition, the cross sectional shape of the first part 75a is determined so that the ratios of the 0th order diffracted light and the +1st order diffracted light with respect to the total quantity of light become predetermined values.</p>
    <p num="147">
      In the above ninth embodiment, the cross sectional shape of the holographic optical element 75 is designed so that the effects of the high-order diffracted lights of  +- 2nd order diffracted lights or higher are small when detecting the light.
      <br/>
      In addition, with respect to the  +- 1st order diffracted lights, the cross sectional shapes of the first and second parts 75a and 75b of the holographic optical element 75 are set to the sawtooth shape shown in FIG. 33 so that the quantity of the emitted +1st order diffracted light is larger than that of the emitted -1st order diffracted light, that is, so that the effects of the -1st order diffracted light which is a divergent ray are minimized.
      <br/>
      However, it is of course possible to design the cross sectional shape of the holographic optical element 75 so that the quantity of the emitted -1st order diffracted light is larger than that of the emitted +1st order diffracted light, that is, so that the -1st order diffracted light which is a divergent ray is positively used and the effects of the +1st order diffracted light are minimized.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      In a tenth embodiment of the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus according to the present invention, the holographic optical element 75 used has a cross sectional shape shown in FIG. 36 along the line A-A' in FIG. 32. An important part of this embodiment is essentially the same as FIG. 32, and an illustration thereof will be omitted.
      <br/>
      Contrary to the ninth embodiment, this embodiment positively uses the -1st order diffracted lights.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the first and second photodetectors 36 a and 36b for generating the focal error signal FES based on the Foucault technique are provided at the image formation points of the -1st order diffracted lights.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the third photodetector 36c for generating the tracking error signal TES based on the push-pull technique is provided at a position deviated from the image formation point 300c of the 0th order diffracted light, that is, between the holographic optical element 75 and the photodetector unit 36.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is possible to generate the focal error signal FES using the Foucault technique and to generate the tracking error signal TES using the push-pull technique by use of a simple optical system.

    <p num="149">
      According to the structure shown in FIG. 34, the +1st order diffracted light obtained from the first part 75a of the holographic optical element 75 may overlap the -1st order diffracted light obtained from the second part 75b, and the -1st order diffracted light obtained from the first part 75a may overlap the +1st order diffracted light obtained from the second part 75b.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the holographic optical element 75 may be constructed so that by itself the holographic optical element 75 acts on the light as shown in FIG. 37.

      In this embodiment, a composite prism 85 splits the reflected light beam which is obtained via the condenser lens 212 into first through fourth light beams 87a through 87d.

      These first through fourth light beams 87a through 87d are irradiated on a photodetector unit 86.

      The photodetector unit 86 includes a first photodetector 86 a which has 4 light receiving parts A through D for receiving the first and second light beams 87a and 87b, a second photodetector 86b which has a light receiving part E for receiving the third light beam 87c, and a third photodetector 86c which has a light receiving part F for receiving the fourth light beam 87d.

      As shown, the composite prism 85 includes a first emission surface 85a for emitting the first light beam 87a, a second emission surface 85b for emitting the second light beam 87b, and third and fourth emission surfaces 85c and 85d for respectively emitting the third and fourth light beams 87c and 87d.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 39(a), the first emission surface 85a has a downward inclination to the right, the second emission surface 85b has a downward inclination to the left, and the third and fourth emission surfaces 85c and 85d form a mountain shape.
      <br/>
      In other words, the third emission surface 85c has a downward inclination to the right, the fourth emission surface 85d has a downward inclination to the left, and the third and fourth emission surfaces 85c and 85d connect to form the mountain shape.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      The first emission surface 85a and the third emission surface 85c are inclined towards the same direction, and an inclination angle  ALPHA 1 of the first emission surface 85a relative to a reference plane is smaller than an inclination angle  ALPHA 3 of the third emission surface 85c.
      <br/>
      For example, the reference plane is the back surface of the composite prism 85, which is approximately perpendicular to the traveling direction of the incoming reflected light beam.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the second emission surface 85b and the fourth emission surface 85d are inclined towards the same direction, and an inclination angle  ALPHA 2 of the second emission surface 85b is smaller than an inclination angle  ALPHA 4 of the fourth emission surface 85d.

      In FIG. 40, the first light beam 87a which is emitted from the first emission surface 85a of the composite prism 85 is received by the light receiving parts A and D of the first photodetector 86a.

      In addition, the second light beam 87b which is emitted from the second emission surface 85b of the composite prism 85 is received by the light receiving parts B and C of the first photodetector 86a.

      Hence, a focal error signal FES is generated according to the Foucault technique based on the formula (2) described above.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the outputs of the light receiving parts A and C are added in an adder 321, the outputs of the light receiving parts B and D are added in an adder 322, and the outputs of these adders 321 and 322 are supplied to a differential amplifier 323 which outputs the focal error signal FES.

      According to this embodiment, it is unnecessary to split the optical path into two by the beam splitter 213 shown in FIG. 1, even though the Foucault technique is used to generate the focal error signal FES and the push-pull technique is used to generate the tracking error signal TES.
      <br/>
      For this reason, it is possible to reduce the space occupied by the optical system within the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is possible to reduce both the number of parts and the cost of the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus because this embodiment does not require the beam splitter 213 and the photodetector 214 shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Furthermore compared to the case where the astigmatism technique is used to generate the focal error signal FES, it is possible to reduce the diameter of the beam spot formed on the photodetector and prevent effects of the external disturbance, thereby making it possible to improve the reliability of the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      Moreover, if the photodetector unit 86 is adjusted to detect a predetermined focal error signal.
      <br/>
      FES, it is possible to employ a structure that would automatically receive the third light beam 87c by the light receiving part E of the photodetector 86b and receive the fourth light beam 87d by the light receiving part F of the photodetector 86c.
      <br/>
      Hence, there is an additional advantage in that no adjustment is required in this case for the detection of the tracking error signal TES.

      FIG. 45 shows a thirteenth embodiment of the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 45, a magneto-optic head unit of an optical information recording/reproducing apparatus is arranged under a magneto-optic disk 505.
      <br/>
      A laser beam emitted from a laser diode 501 which is used as a coherent light source is converted into a parallel ray by a collimator lens 502, and is input to a beam splitter 503.
      <br/>
      The parallel ray transmitted through the beam splitter 503 is converged on a magnetic layer of the magneto-optic disk 505 by an objective lens 504.
      <br/>
      The converged laser beam is reflected by the magneto-optic disk 505, and is input again to the beam splitter 503.
      <br/>
      This time, the reflected light beam is reflected by the beam splitter 503 towards a photodetector unit 509.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the reflected light beam is reflected by the beam splitter 503 and is input to a Wollaston prism 506 which is an analyzer.
    </p>
    <p num="182">
      FIG. 46 shows a perspective view of an important part of the thirteenth embodiment, that is, a signal detection system, on an enlarged scale.

      FIG. 46 shows a state where the light beam output from the Wollaston prism 506 is projected on the photodetector unit 509, viewed from the back surface side of the photodetector unit 509.
      <br/>
      The reflected light beam input to the Wollaston prism 506 is separated into two polarized light beams and input to a composite prism 507.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 46, the composite prism 507 is an optical element having three deflection surfaces 571, 572 and 573 arranged side by side from the left to right.
      <br/>
      The deflection surfaces 571 and 573 on both sides of the composite prism 507 have tapered surfaces for deflecting the light beam in upward and downward directions by mutually different angles.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the deflection surface 572 at the central part of the composite prism 507 has a convex shape having a curvature with respect to the optical axis.
      <br/>
      Each of the two polarized light beams input to the composite prism 507 having the structure described above is spatially split into three by the three deflection surfaces 571, 572 and 573, thereby outputting a total of six light beams from the composite prism 507.
      <br/>
      The six light beams output from the composite prism 507 are projected on the photodetector unit 509 via a condenser lens 508.

    <p num="184">
      As may be seen from FIGS. 47 through 49, the photodetector unit 509 is a light receiving element, and photodetectors of the photodetector unit 509 are arranged in three stages from the top to bottom in the vertical direction.
      <br/>
      An upper stage portion of the photodetector unit 509 has a photodetector including a photodetector part G for detecting a magneto-optic signal MO and an identification signal ID, and a 2-part photodetector including photodetector parts A and B for detecting a focal error signal FES.
      <br/>
      A middle stage portion of the photodetector unit 509 has a 2-part photodetector including photodetector parts E and F for detecting a tracking error signal TES.
      <br/>
      Further, a lower stage portion of the photodetector unit 509 has a 2-part photodetector including photodetector parts C and D for detecting the focal error signal FES, and a photodetector including a photodetector part H for detecting the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID.
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      The 2-part photodetector in the lower stage portion and including the photodetector parts C and D is arranged below the photodetector in the upper stage portion and including the photodetector part G for detecting the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the 2-part photodetector in the upper stage portion and including the photodetector parts A and B is arranged above the photodetector in the lower stage portion and including the photodetector part H for detecting the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID.
      <br/>
      The photodetector parts A and B are separated by a vertical division line, and the photodetector parts C and D are separated by a vertical division line.

      The photodetector parts E and F are separated by a horizontal division line.

    <p num="192">In addition, the identification signal ID can be reproduced based on the following formula (16a) or (16b) by calculation, using known adders.</p>
    <p num="193">
      ID=(A+B+H)+(C+D+G)   (16a)
      <br/>
      ID=A+B+C+D+E+F+H+G   (16b)
    </p>
    <p num="194">
      When the identification signal ID is reproduced based on the formula (16a), the number of adders provided in the LSI is relatively small, thereby making it possible to improve the S/N ratio of the identification signal ID.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the identification signal ID may become distorted depending on the shape and depth of the pits formed in the magneto-optic disk 505.
      <br/>
      Hence, when the identification signal ID is reproduced based on the formula (16b), it is possible to positively prevent the identification signal ID from becoming distorted because all of the diffracted light beams from the pits of the magneto-optic disk 505 are used to detect the identification signal ID.
    </p>
    <p num="195">
      According to this embodiment, a beam splitter means comprises a plurality of beam splitting stages for splitting the reflected light beam from the magneto-optic disk 505 into a plurality of light beams which are projected onto a single light receiving element.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the beam splitter means comprises the Wollaston prism 506 and the composite prism 507 in this embodiment, and the reflected light beam from the magneto-optic disk 505 is split into six light beams.
      <br/>
      The six split light beams are projected onto the single photodetector unit 509.
      <br/>
      As a result, the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus can be formed by a relatively small number of parts, and the arrangement of these relatively small number of parts can be simply adjusted with ease.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the cost of the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus can be reduced due to the relatively small number of parts used.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the photodetector unit 509 is formed by only five photodetectors (eight photodetector parts A through H), it is possible to reduce the stray capacitance of the photodetectors and to reduce the noise generated by the adders and subtracter within the LSI which obtains the focal error signal FES, the tracking error signal TES, the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID, as compared to the embodiment shown in FIGS. 25 and 26, for example.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the signal qualities of these signals FES, TES, MO and ID can be improved.
    </p>
    <p num="196">
      In addition, the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID are reproduced using also the outputs of the 2-part photodetectors (photodetector parts A, B, C and D) which detect the light beams for obtaining the focal error signal FES, in addition to using the outputs of the photodetectors (photodetector parts G and H) which detect the light beams for obtaining the magneto-optic signal and the identification signal ID.
      <br/>
      Thus, because of the small number of photodetector parts used to reproduce the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID, the S/N ratio of these signal MO and ID is improved.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the required frequency bands of the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID are higher than those of the tracking error signal TES and the focal error signal FES which requires a frequency band lower than that of the tracking error signal TES.
      <br/>
      Further, when two or more kinds of signals are obtained based on the detection of the same light beam, the circuit construction of the circuit used to obtain these signals becomes simpler as the frequency bands of these signal become wider apart from each other.
      <br/>
      Therefore, by obtaining the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID based on the detection of the same light beam that is used to obtain the focal error signal FES, it is possible to simplify the circuit construction also from this point of view.
    </p>
    <p num="197">
      Furthermore, because the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID are reproduced using also the outputs of the 2-part photodetectors (photodetector parts A, B, C and D) which detect the light beams for obtaining the focal error signal FES in addition to using the outputs of the photodetectors (photodetector parts G and H) which detect the light beams for obtaining the magneto-optic signal and the identification signal ID, the resolution of the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID is improved.
      <br/>
      It is taught in a Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 7-6379 that the resolution of the magneto-optic signal is improved when a central portion of the reflected light beam from a recording medium is masked and the magneto-optic signal is detected from a peripheral portion of the reflected light beam.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the light beam used to detect the focal error signal FES is the light beam transmitted through the tapered deflection surfaces 571 and 573 of the composite prism 507 as shown in FIG. 46. In other words, out of the reflected light beam from the magneto-optic disk 505, the light beam transmitted through the central deflection surface 572 of the composite prism 507 is not used, and only the light beam transmitted through the tapered deflection surfaces 571 and 573 on both sides of the central deflection surface 572 of the composite prism 507 is used to detect the focal error signal FES.
      <br/>
      As a result, the resolution of the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID is improved by obtaining the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID using the light beam which is transmitted through the tapered deflection surfaces 571 and 573 of the composite prism 507 and is used to detect the focal error signal FES.

      <br/>
      FIGS. 50B and 50C respectively show plan views of the photodetector part G of the photodetector unit 509 on which the light beams "a" and "b" are projected, together with spots "aa" and "bb" of the light beams "a" and "b" irradiated on the photodetector part G and the photodetector parts A and B via the deflection surface 571.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 50B and 50C show the photodetector viewed from the back surface side of the photodetector unit 509.
    </p>
    <p num="199">
      The area of the light beam "b" transmitted through the deflection surface 571 is smaller than that of the light beam "a", which means that the light beam "b" is deflected more.
      <br/>
      In this state, the length of the spot "bb" formed on the photodetector parts A and B along the major axis is longer than that of the spot "aa" formed on the photodetector part G. According to the Foucault technique, the longer the length of the spot along the major axis, the easier: it is to perform the required adjustments of the arrangement of the optical elements and the photodetectors, and the focal error signal FES is less affected by changes with time, temperature changes and the like.
      <br/>
      Hence, in this embodiment, the locations of the 2-part photodetector including the photodetector parts A and B and the 2-part photodetector including the photodetector parts C and D are determined so that out of the light beams transmitted through the deflection surfaces 571 and 573, the light beams which are deflected more are projected onto the 2-part photodetector including the photodetector parts A and B and the 2-part photodetector including the photodetector part C and D.

    <p num="200">
      Next, a description will be given of the effects of the temperature on this embodiment.
      <br/>
      When the temperature of the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus rises, a housing which fixes the photodetector unit 509 undergoes a thermal expansion, thereby making the photodetectors of the photodetector unit 509 farther away from the composite prism 507.
      <br/>
      For similar reasons, the objective lens 504 become farther away from the magneto-optic disk 505.
      <br/>
      As a result, the reflected light beam from the magneto-optic disk 505 is once converged and thereafter spreads before being projected onto the photodetector unit 509.
      <br/>
      The spot formed on the 2-part photodetector including the photodetector parts A and B and the spot formed on the 2-part photodetector including the photodetector parts C and D are projected on the corresponding division lines of the 2-part photodetectors when the 2-part photodetectors are located at the focal positions of the light beams.
      <br/>
      However, if the 2-part photodetectors are located farther away from the focal positions of the light beams, the spots of the light beams are formed on the outer sides of the corresponding division lines of the 2-part photodetectors as shown in FIG. 49, and in this case, the spots of the light beams are only formed on the photodetector parts B and D of the 2-part photodetectors.
    </p>
    <p num="201">
      When the temperature of the magneto-optic head rises, the separation angle of the light beams output from the Wollaston prism 506 also changes.
      <br/>
      FIG. 51 shows a plan view of the photodetector unit 509 at a high temperature,.viewed from the back surface side of the photodetector unit 509.
      <br/>
      The Wollaston prism 506 is made of a birefringence material such as crystal and lithium-niobate, and the separation angle of the light beams changes depending on the temperature.
      <br/>
      For example, a description will be given of the Wollaston prism 506 having a separation angle which becomes narrow at high temperatures.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 51, the spots of the light beams formed on the 2-part photodetectors located on the right and left move towards the inner side of the photodetector unit 509 due to the temperature characteristic of the Wollaston prism 506.
      <br/>
      In other words, the separation angle of the light beams output from the Wollaston prism 506 becomes narrow due to the temperature rise, and the spots of the light beams move toward the inner side of the photodetector unit 509 to become projected on the corresponding division lines of the 2-part photodetectors respectively including the photodetector parts A and B and the photodetector parts C and D.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      In the case where the separation angle of the light beams output from the Wollaston prism 506 used becomes narrow at high temperatures and the 2-part photodetectors located on the right and left of the photodetector unit 509 are positioned farther away from the focal positions of the light beams, the light beams used are such that the spots of the light beams are formed on the outer side of the corresponding division lines of the 2-part photodetectors.
      <br/>
      Hence, when the temperature rises and the 2-part photodetectors become farther away from the Wollaston prism 506, the separation angle of the light beams output from the Wollaston prism 506 becomes narrow such that the spots of the light beams are projected on the corresponding division lines of the 2-part photodetectors of the photodetector unit 509.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is possible to carry out a stable automatic focusing operation based on an accurate focal error signal FES even when the temperature becomes high.

      On the other hand, in the case where the separation angle of the light beams output from the Wollaston prism 506 used or, a Rochon prism (not shown) which is use in place of the Wollaston prism 506, becomes wide at high temperatures and the 2-part photodetectors located on the right and left of the photodetector unit 509 are positioned farther away from the focal positions of the light beams, the light beams used are such that the spots of the light beams are formed on the inner side of the corresponding division lines of the 2-part photodetectors.

      Hence, when the temperature rises and the 2-part photodetectors become farther away from the Wollaston prism 506, the separation angle of the light beams output from the Wollaston prism 506 becomes wide such that the spots of the light beams are projected on the corresponding division lines of the 2-part photodetectors of the photodetector unit 509.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is possible to carry out a stable automatic focusing operation based on an accurate focal error signal FES even when the temperature becomes high.

      Next, a description will be given of a first modification of the thirteenth embodiment of the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus according to the present invention, by referring to FIG. 52. In this first modification of the thirteenth embodiment, the basic construction of the optical information recording/reproducing apparatus is basically the same as that of the thirteenth embodiment shown in FIGS. 45 and 46, but a photodetector unit 591 is used in place of the photodetector unit 509.
      <br/>
      FIG. 52 shows a plan view of the photodetector unit 591 used in this first modification of the thirteenth embodiment.
      <br/>

      FIG. 52 shows the photodetector unit 591 in a state where the laser beam is in focus on the magneto-optic disk 505, viewed from the back surface side of the photodetector unit 591.
      <br/>
      The light beams reaching the photodetector unit 591 via the Wollaston prism 506 and the composite prism 507 is obtained via the same optical path as that of the thirteenth embodiment.
      <br/>
      Photodetectors of the photodetector unit 591 are arranged in three stages from the top to bottom in the vertical direction.
      <br/>
      An upper stage portion of the photodetector unit 591 has a photodetector including a photodetector part G for detecting a magneto-optic signal MO and an identification signal ID, and a 2-part photodetector including photodetector parts AA and BB for detecting a focal error signal FES.
      <br/>
      A middle stage portion of the photodetector unit 591 has a 2-part photodetector including photodetector parts E and F for detecting a tracking error signal TES.
      <br/>
      Further, a lower stage portion of the photodetector unit 591 has a 2-part photodetector including photodetector parts C and D for detecting the focal error signal FES, and a photodetector including a photodetector part H for detecting the magneto-optic signal MO and the identification signal ID.
    </p>
    <p num="206">
      This first modification of the thirteenth embodiment, the light beam which forms a spot having an oval shape which is longer along the major axis and the light beam which forms a spot having an oval shape which is shorter along the major axis on the photodetector unit 591 are used to obtain the focal error signal FES.
      <br/>
      In other words, one of the two light beams obtained by the separation made at the Wollaston prism 506 or Rochon prsim is used to detect the focal error signal FES.
      <br/>
      As a result, the obtained focal error signal FES is less affected by the temperature characteristic of the Wollaston prism 506 or Rochon prism when compared with the thirteenth embodiment described above.
    </p>
    <p num="207">
      As described above, the separation angle of the two light beams output from the Wollaston prism 506 or Rochon prsim changes with temperature.
      <br/>
      For example, the separation angle of the two light beams output from the Wollaston prism 506 becomes narrow at high temperatures.
      <br/>
      Hence, if both the two light beams separated and output from the Wollaston prism 506 are used to detect the focal error signal FES, the focal error signal FES is greatly affected by the temperature.
      <br/>
      But if only one of the two light beams separated and output from the Wollaston prism 506 is used to detect the focal error signal FES as in the case of the first modification of the thirteenth embodiment, it is possible to detect the focal error signal FES without being affected by the temperature characteristic of the Wollaston prism 506 or Rochon prism.

      When the identification signal ID is reproduced based on the formula (20a), the number of adders provided in the LSI is relatively small, thereby making it possible to improve the S/N ratio of the identification signal ID.

      On the other hand, the identification signal ID may become distorted depending on the shape and depth of the pits formed in the magneto-optic disk 505.

      Hence, when the identification signal ID is reproduced based on the formula (20b), it is possible to positively prevent the identification signal ID from becoming distorted because all of the diffracted light beams from the pits of the magneto-optic disk 505 are used to detect the identification signal ID.
