    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates, in general, to polymerizable compositions based on thio(meth)acrylate monomers, producing transparent polymer compositions exhibiting the properties which are required for their application in the field of ophthalmics.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">It has long been known to employ organic polymer materials for obtaining ophthalmic lenses.</p>
    <p num="4">One of the materials most commonly employed is obtained by polymerization of the monomer CR 39200  (diethylene glycol diallyl carbonate).</p>
    <p num="5">However, for a number of years, there has been an increasing demand for lenses which, while guaranteeing substantially the same optical qualities and the same mechanical characteristics as the lenses made of known organic polymer material, are thinner and are therefore lighter in weight.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Various materials have been developed to meet this demand.
      <br/>
      These new organic materials generally have high refractive indices which can reach, or even exceed, refractive indices n=1.6.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Thus, as a result of this high refractive index, it is possible to manufacture lenses of lower thickness for an equivalent corrective power (optical power).</p>
    <p num="8">A class of monomers that have recently been tested for obtaining materials in ophthalmics is the class of thio(meth)acrylates.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Patent EP-A-273 661 describes monomers of thio(meth)acrylate type which can be used in the field of ophthalmic optics, and patent EP-A-273 710 describes polymerizable compositions producing transparent organic polymers which are suitable for the production of ophthalmic lenses.
      <br/>
      These compositions contain a monomer which has at least one thio(meth)acryloyl group and at least two (meth)acryloyl groups and, optionally, at least one other monomer which is copolymerizable by a radical route.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Patent EP-A-273 710 describes in particular compositions based on bis(2-methacryloylthioethyl) sulfide.</p>
    <p num="11">This patent also mentions that the polymerizable compositions can be polymerized by a thermal route, by UV irradiation or by the action of an electron beam.</p>
    <p num="12">All the compositions given by way of example in this patent are polymerized either by a purely thermal route (for several hours), or by prepolymerization using UV irradiation followed by a thermal polymerization to obtain a hardened moulded article.</p>
    <p num="13">Patent application WO-90/04587 describes 4,4'-bis �(meth)acryloylthiophenyl� sulfide monomers and their use in poymerizable compositions in combination with a copolymerizable vinyl monomer and/or polythiols.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">It would therefore be desirable to produce polymerizable compositions making it possible to obtain transparent hardened polymer compositions exhibiting all the properties that are required for an application in ophthalmic optics.</p>
    <p num="15">It would be desirable, in particular, to produce polymerizable compositions resulting in hardened polymer compositions exhibiting high transparency and refractive index, for example a refractive index higher than 1.55 and preferably of the order of 1.6, a high abbe number, a low density, good colourability and good impact strength.</p>
    <p num="16">It would also be desirable that the hardened polymer compositions should stand up well to ageing and in particular should have a good resistance to degradation by ultraviolet radiation.</p>
    <p num="17">It would also be desirable to obtain polymerizable compositions producing transparent polymer compositions which are useful in ophthalmic optics, which can be photopolymerized in very short periods of time, for example with irradiation times of the order of 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
    <p num="18">Such a very short period of time for forming and hardening the polymer composition starting from polymerizable compositions is an advantage that is of particular interest in an industrial content, since it enables the manufacturing time to be appreciably reduced and the production efficiency to be increased.</p>
    <p num="19">
      As mentioned previously, optical and ophthalmic articles made from the compositions according to the invention shall exhibit a high transparency.
      <br/>
      Transparency may be evaluated by determining visually the absence of diffusion areas within the article and its yellow index.
      <br/>
      The lower is the yellow index (YI), the higher is the transparency of the article.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The objective of the present invention is therefore to produce polymerizable compositions which have the above mentioned advantages and in particular which can be photopolymerized in a very short time.</p>
    <p num="21">A further objective of the present invention is to formulate polymerisable compositions which result in optical and ophthalmic moulded articles having high transparency as quantified by the absence of diffusion areas and lower yellow indices (YI).</p>
    <p num="22">
      Another objective of the present invention is the polymer compositions obtained by polymerization of the polymerizable compositions.
      <br/>
      Another objective of the present invention is the optical articles manufactured from polymer compositions.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The above objectives are attained, according to the invention, by producing a polymerizable composition comprising, based on the total weight of polymerizable monomers present in the composition:</p>
    <p num="24">a) 10 to 70% by weight of a difunctional thio(meth)acrylate monomer, of formula (I):  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="25">in which R1 and R2 denote a hydrogen atom or a radical --CH3,</p>
    <p num="26">or of a mixture of at least one monomer of formula (I) with at least one monomer of formula (II):  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="27">
      in which R'1 and R'2 denote a hydrogen atom or a radical --CH3 ;
      <br/>
      b) 10 to 60% by weight of at least one monomer of formula (III):  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      in which R3 and R4 denote a hydrogen atom or a radical --CH3 and O &lt;= m+n &lt;= 10; and
      <br/>
      c) 5 to 30% by weight of at least one aromatic or polycyclane mono(meth)acrylate monomer.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The composition of the invention may further comprise, based on the total weight of polymerizable monomers present in composition:
      <br/>
      d) up to 15% by weight of a polyalkylene glycol di(meth)acrylate; and/or
      <br/>
      e) up to 15% and preferably up to 10% by weight of a polythiol R(SH)n, in which n is an integer varying from 2 to 6 and preferably from 2 to 3, R is an organic group of valency equal to n, or a mixture of these polythiols.

    <p num="57">The polymerizable compositions according to the invention may also include additives which are conventionally employed in polymerizable compositions intended for moulding optical articles, in particular ophthalmic lenses, in conventional proportions, namely inhibitors, dyes, UV absorbers, perfumes, deodorants, antioxidants and antiyellowing agents.</p>
    <p num="58">The perfumes allow the odor of the compositions to be masked, in particular during surfacing or routering operations.</p>
    <p num="59">In fact, articles which are moulded from the polymerizable compositions according to the invention can, during surfacing or routering operations, give off odours due to the presence of sulphur compounds (for example BMATES and BMATPS).</p>
    <p num="60">
      These odours can be considerably limited by resorting to the introduction of perfumes into the base polymerizable composition.

    <p num="61">Another known technique for removing odours from the polymerizable compositions during surfacing or routering operations is described in patent applications JP-04 068 085 and JP-61 099010, and consists in employing, during these operations, a coolant solution containing a perfume and/or a deodorant.</p>
    <p num="62">It is also possible and often even preferable, to employ both these techniques in combination.</p>
    <p num="63">It has also been found, in accordance with the invention that it was possible to reduce the odours considerably during subsequent operations on the articles which are moulded from the polymerizable composition according to the invention when using, as sulphur-containing monomers, a mixture of BMATES and of BMATPS in which the proportion of the BMATES is lower than or equal to 30% by weight relative to the total weight of the components a) to e), and preferably lower than or equal to 20% by weight.</p>

    <p num="69">Preferably, too, this photopolymerisation is a photopolymerisation by irradiation with ultraviolet light.</p>
    <p num="70">The invention also relates to optical articles manufactured from polymer compositions according to the invention, and in particular, of ophthalmic lenses.</p>
    <p num="71">
      Ophthalmic lenses can be obtained in their definitive form by casting of the polymerizable compositions between two moulds which have the required surface geometries, followed by polymerization.
      <br/>
      A lens whose two faces are in the final state is then obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="72">It is also possible to manufacture semi-finished lenses comprising, after moulding, only one face with its final geometry, it being then possible for the second face to be surfaced as needed.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="73">The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention without, however, being limiting in nature.</p>
    <p num="74">Unless stated otherwise, all the proportions of the constituents in the examples are expressed by weight.</p>
    <p num="75">EXAMPLES 1 TO 11</p>
    <p num="76">
      The photopolymerizable compositions were prepared by mixing the constituents shown in Table I below, in the proportions indicated in this table and by stirring the mixtures at 40 (degree)  C. The weight percentages of the photoinitiators are percentages relative to the total weight of the constituents a), b), c), d) and e).
      <br/>
      The mixtures were then filtered and degassed.
      <br/>
      Lenses were manufactured from these polymerizable compositions by casting the liquid obtained in a mould which had a variable center thickness, consisting of two parts of a mould made of mineral glass which were held together by an adhesive tape at their periphery.
      <br/>
      When it is not specified, the thickness is 1.5 mm. The moulds were then irradiated on both sides with a radiation of 80 W/cm2 produced by ultraviolet lamps for approximately 3 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="77">After this treatment, the lenses formed were demoulded and subjected to a postcure (annealing) at 120 (degree)  C. for 2 hours.</p>
    <p num="78">
      The following properties of the lenses obtained were then examined: transmission, refractive index, Abbe number, optical quality of the surface, impact strength and temperature resistance.
      <br/>
      The optical accuracy was assessed visually, O denoting a faultless surface and X a surface exhibiting defects.
      <br/>
      The impact strength was determined by the drop of a metal ball weighing 16 g (Examples 1 to 10) or 22 g (Example 11) from a height of 1.27 m, in the centre of the lens, according to the Food and Drug Administration method.
      <br/>
      The thickness in the centre of the lens is shown between brackets.
      <br/>
      O means that the lens is intact after the drop of a ball in the case of the corresponding central thickness.
    </p>
    <p num="79">Stresses are evaluated by observing the lens visually under polarized light.</p>
    <p num="80">O means the absence of stress.</p>
    <p num="81">X means the presence of stresses.</p>
    <p num="82">The temperature resistance is determined by studying the lenses before and after postcure.</p>
    <p num="83">Absence of geometrical deformation O.</p>
    <p num="84">Presence of deformations X.</p>
    <p num="85">
      The yellow index (YI) is determined spectrocospically and visually.
      <br/>
      A standarised method is used to determine the yellow index by the spectroscopic method (ASTM-D-1925-63).
      <br/>
      The yellow index is defined as follows:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      where X, Y and Z are thrichromatic coordinates of the sample measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer scanning the spectrum from 380 to 780 nanometers.
      <br/>
      YI is determined before and/or after annealing of the sample.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      The visual method uses four standard glass samples containing increasing quantities of yellow dye to establish a range of yellows.
      <br/>
      Samples are classified according to their respective levels of yellow.
