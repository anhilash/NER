    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates generally to the field of mounting systems, and more particularly to a holder assembly system and method for aligning a nozzle and a diffuser in an emitted energy system that may be used for photolithography production of semiconductor components.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Photolithographic fabrication of semiconductor components, such as integrated circuits and dynamic RAM (DRAM) chips, is customary in the semiconductor industry.
      <br/>
      In photolithographic fabrication, light may be used to cure or harden a photomask that is used to form a pattern of conductive, semiconductive, and insulative components in the semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      The resulting pattern of conductive, semiconductive, and insulative components on the semiconductor layer form extremely small microelectronic devices, such as transistors, diodes, and the like.
      <br/>
      The microelectronic devices are generally combined to form various semiconductor components.

      The density of the microelectronic devices on the semiconductor layer may be increased by decreasing the size or geometry of the various conductive, semiconductive, and insulative components formed on the semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      This decrease in size allows a larger number of such microelectronic devices to be formed on the semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      As a result, the computing power and speed of the semiconductor component may be greatly improved.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The lower limit on the size, often referred to as the linewidth, of a microelectronic device is generally limited by the wavelength of light used in the photolithographic process.
      <br/>
      The shorter the wavelength of light used in the photolithographic process, the smaller the size or linewidth of the microelectronic device that may be formed on the semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      Semiconductor component fabrication may be further improved by increasing the intensity of the light used in the photolithographic process, which reduces the time the photomask material needs to be radiated with light.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the greater the intensity of light used in the photolithographic process, the shorter the time the photomask material is radiated with light.
      <br/>
      As a result, the semiconductor components may be produced faster and less expensively.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Extreme ultra-violet (EUV) light has a very short wavelength and is preferable for photolithographic fabrication of semiconductor components.
      <br/>
      Conventional methods of generating EUV light typically include impinging an energy source into a hard target to produce, or radiate, EUV light.
      <br/>
      The energy source may be a high energy laser, electron beam, an electrical arc, or the like.
      <br/>
      The hard target is generally a ceramic, thin-film, or solid target comprising such materials as tungsten, tin, copper, gold, solid xenon, or the like.
      <br/>
      Optics, such as mirrors and lenses, are used to reflect and focus the EUV light on the semiconductor layer.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Conventional energy beam systems and processes suffer from numerous disadvantages.
      <br/>
      One disadvantage of conventional methods of producing EUV light is that debris from the energy source/target interaction is produced during the production of the EUV light.
      <br/>
      The production of debris increases with the intensity of the energy source and results in the target being degraded and eventually destroyed.
      <br/>
      The debris may coat and contaminate the optics and other components of the energy beam system, thereby reducing the efficiency and performance of the system.
      <br/>
      The reduced performance requires a greater frequency of system maintenance and system downtime.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      Accordingly, a need has arisen for an improved emitted energy system and method.
      <br/>
      One embodiment of an improved emitted energy system and method may include a holder assembly for aligning a nozzle and a diffuser.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides a holder assembly system and method that substantially eliminates or reduces problems associated with the prior systems and methods.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In accordance with the present invention, a holder assembly may comprise a nozzle mounting system coupled to a housing assembly to secure a nozzle in the housing.
      <br/>
      A diffuser mounting system may also be coupled to the housing assembly.
      <br/>
      The diffuser mounting system may secure a diffuser in the housing assembly.
      <br/>
      An alignment system may operate to align the nozzle and the diffuser in a spatial relationship with each other to optimize operation of the diffuser in relation to the nozzle.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Conventional alignment systems can use separate holders for the nozzle and the diffuser.
      <br/>
      The separate holders necessitate the shutdown of the energy beam system during maintenance, which is extended due to the time required to align the nozzle and the diffuser.
      <br/>
      In addition, conventional alignment systems may not maintain precise alignment between the nozzle and the diffuser during extended periods of operation.
      <br/>
      The number and extended length of the maintenance operations increases production costs and decreases the production of semiconductor components.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The present invention provides several technical advantages.
      <br/>
      For example, the invention allows the nozzle and the diffuser to be prealigned and checked rapidly as a subunit prior to installation into a vacuum chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Accordingly, the system's downtime and maintenance may be decreased, thereby increasing productivity.
      <br/>
      Another technical advantage of the present invention is that the holder assembly maintains precise alignment between the nozzle and the diffuser over an extended period of operational time.
      <br/>
      A further technical advantage of the present invention is that the holder assembly may include provisions to cool the nozzle and diffuser during operation of the emitted energy system.

    <p num="13">Other technical advantages will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims.</p>

    <p num="33">
      The fluid flow characteristics of the fluid 34 in the fluid plume 40 are strictly controlled and substantially defined by the design of the nozzle 22.
      <br/>
      The design of the nozzle 22 generally controls the quantity of the fluid 34 being discharged, the average size of clustered gas atoms or molecules of the fluid 34 in the fluid plume 40, the velocity of the fluid 34, and the temperature of the fluid 34, as well as the size and shape of the fluid plume 40.
      <br/>
      These flow characteristics may individually and in combination affect the operation of the emitted energy system 10.

      Clustering of the fluid 34 increases the average particle size of the clustered atoms or molecules of the fluid 34 in the fluid plume 40.
      <br/>
      The clustered atoms or molecules of the fluid 34 in the fluid plume 40 may have an optimum cluster size which may increase the quantity of the emitted energy 16 produced during the interaction of the fluid system 12 and the energy system 14.

      The photolithography system interface 68 may include other devices and systems for directing the emitted energy 16 without departing from the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, the photolithography system interface 68 may include additional optics, mirrors, or masks, that may affect the pattern of the emitted energy 16 impinging the photoresist layer 80.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In operation, the photolithography system interface 68 receives the emitted energy 16 from the output optics 18 and directs the emitted energy 16 toward the mask 72.

      The mask 72 screens the emitted energy 16 such that a pattern of the emitted energy 16 is directed toward the photoresist layer 80 of the semiconductor target 74.
      <br/>
      The portion of the photoresist layer 80 upon which the emitted energy 16 is incident, reacts to the emitted energy 16.

      The non-reacted portion of the photoresist layer 80 is then removed to expose a portion of the underlying substrate 78.

    <p num="49">
      The remaining portion of the photoresist layer 80 forms the photoresist mask 82 in a pattern corresponding to the mask pattern 76 in the mask 72.
      <br/>
      Semiconductor fabrication processes such as wet etching, dry etching, ion implantation, or other suitable processes may then be performed on the exposed substrate 78 to form the structure 86.
      <br/>
      For example, the substrate 78 may be subjected to an ion implantation process such that a source region and a drain region of a transistor is formed.
      <br/>
      The substrate 78 could also be subjected to a plasma-based etch process such as a reactive ion etch (RIE) that anisotropically etches the substrate 78 to form an element of a transistor, such as a gate or a sidewall body.

      In short, the emitted energy system allows the economical and debris-free production of an emitted energy.
      <br/>
      The emitted energy is produced in a manner that reduces contamination of the components of the emitted energy system.
      <br/>
      For example, the input and output optics, along with the surfaces of the diffuser, nozzle, chamber, and the holder assembly will not require the same level of maintenance and cleaning as required in conventional systems for producing an emitted energy.
      <br/>
      In addition, the fluid used to produce the emitted energy is not damaged or destroyed by operation of the emitted energy system.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the emitted energy system may be economically produced because the pumping requirements of the recycle system may be reduced.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the pumping requirements of the chamber pump may be reduced.

    <p num="52">
      In photolithographic applications, the emitted energy system will preferably produce extreme ultra-violet light at high intensity.

      The high intensity ultra-violet light attainable with the present invention will facilitate the cost effective fabrication of semiconductor devices that have microelectronic device features with linewidths of 100 nanometers or less.
      <br/>
      The emitted energy system will also allow a greater number of microelectronic devices to be placed within the semiconductor device, which will correspondingly increase the computing power and speed of the semiconductor device.

      In operation, and according to the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the pressurized fluid 34 enters the nozzle 22 at the inlet 114.
      <br/>
      The fluid 34 flows through the transition passage 116 portion of the inlet passage 112 which may be converging for a short distance.
      <br/>
      The nozzle 22 is generally cooled to help maintain the temperature of the fluid 34.
      <br/>
      The fluid 34 passes through the throat 128 and into the nozzle passage 118 that is diverging.
      <br/>
      The diverging nozzle passage 118 allows the fluid 34 flowing through the nozzle passage 118 to expand, thereby further decreasing the temperature and pressure of the fluid 34.
      <br/>
      As the temperature and pressure of the fluid 34 decreases, the density of the fluid 34 flowing through the diverging nozzle passage 118 decreases.
      <br/>
      The longitudinal length 120 of the diverging discharge passage 118 is sufficient to produce clustering of the cooled fluid 34 flowing through the nozzle 22.
      <br/>
      Clustering is the clumping together of the atoms or molecules in the fluid 34, thereby increasing the particle size of the individual fluid particles within the clustered fluid 34 forming the fluid plume 40.
      <br/>
      This clustering is very important to the successful implementation of the fluid jet as a light-generating source.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The fluid 34 exits the discharge orifice 124 of the nozzle 22 at a high speed, generally at supersonic velocities.

      In one embodiment, the velocity of the fluid 34 exiting the discharge orifice 124 is approximately Mach 3.
      <br/>
      The high speed fluid 34 exiting the discharge orifice 124 and contains the clustered fluid 34 which forms the fluid plume 40.
      <br/>
      As discussed previously, the input energy 64 may be directed into the fluid plume 40 to form the plasma 66.
      <br/>
      The plasma 66 may produce the emitted energy 16 that is collected and directed by the output optics 18 onto the target 20.

    <p num="69">
      The nozzle, although long and narrow in its internal passage must be very small in its throat diameter or cross-section.
      <br/>
      The nozzle must also be of smooth and regular internal contour so as to allow for unimpeded flow.
      <br/>
      The smaller the nozzle throat, the less gas will pass into the vacuum chamber at the required nozzle inlet thermodynamic state, so pumping requirements to maintain proper pressure in the vacuum chamber can be correspondingly reduced.
      <br/>
      In addition, the longitudinal length and the taper of the nozzle passage cools the fluid and allows sufficient time for the fluid particles to cluster.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the fluid plume may have fluid characteristics that are optimal for producing the emitted energy in response to the input energy.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the size and shape of the fluid plume are strictly controlled and defined.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the optimal location for directing the input energy into the fluid plume can be accurately determined to maximize the intensity of emitted energy produced.

      In operation, and as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 4, the fluid 34 from the fluid plume 40 is substantially captured by the diffuser inlet 312 of the diffuser passage 310.
      <br/>
      The fluid 34 flows through the diffuser inlet 312 into the diffuser entry passage 316 which is a diverging passage that helps prevent the fluid 34 from back-streaming out of the diffuser passage 310 into the chamber 42.
      <br/>

      In short, the diffuser in combination with the nozzle is configured to utilize the dynamic properties of the fluid to direct the fluid, and other contaminants formed during operation of the emitted energy system, into the diffuser to increase the pressure within the diffuser.
      <br/>
      The increased pressure of the fluid within the diffuser reduces the pumping requirements of the chamber pump.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the cost of the emitted energy system may be decreased.
      <br/>
      The diffuser also reduces plasma-induced erosion by capturing contaminants that may contaminate the emitted energy system or condense on optic elements.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the diffuser maximizes the emitted energy collected and transmitted by the output optics and helps promote stable, continuous system operation.
