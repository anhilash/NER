    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of The Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a lubricant oil composition, more particularly, the composition characterized by high transmission torque capacity and good anti-shudder property, and useful for an automatic and continuously variable transmission (e.g., belt or traction type) with a built-in torque converter equipped with a lock-up clutch, the transmission being used in an automobile.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of The Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A lubricant oil for an automatic or continuously variable transmission can be used in an automobile equipped with a torque converter, gear and hydraulic mechanisms, wet type clutch, and so on.
      <br/>
      This type of lubricant is required to have a variety of properties, because it functions as the power transmission medium for the torque converter, and hydraulic and control systems; as the lubricant and temperature-controlling medium for the gears, bearings, wet type clutch, and so on; and as the lubricant medium and the medium to maintain the function-related characteristics of the friction material, in order to smoothly operate the transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Recently, lock-up clutches have been built in torque converters in many automobiles to improve mileage.
      <br/>
      In this mechanism, a transmission is built in a torque converter.
      <br/>
      A lock-up clutch is a device that directly transmits the engine driving force to the transmission under varying running conditions.
      <br/>
      Torque converter efficiency can be enhanced, when switching between torque converter driving and direct driving is well timed.
    </p>
    <p num="6">However, a conventional lock-up clutch mechanism works only in a high speed range, and not in a low speed range where engine torque widely varies.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Recently, slip control is adopted to help the lock-up clutch work in the low speed range of an automatic transmission.
      <br/>
      However, abnormal vibration of the car body, known as shudder, has been frequently observed at the lock-up clutch's surface, when the lock-up mechanism is operated in a low speed range.
      <br/>
      Such a phenomenon is more pronounced, when coefficient of friction decreases as relative sliding velocity increases at the slip-controlled lock-up clutch.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent the shudder phenomenon, the lubricant is required to have good  MU (coefficient of friction)-V (sliding velocity) characteristics.
      <br/>
      In other words, it is required to have a coefficient of friction which increases as sliding velocity increases, i.e., positive  MU -V relationship, for an automatic and continuously variable transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Esters of phosphates, aliphatic acids and fatty amides have been proposed as friction modifiers for automatic transmission lubricants, as disclosed by Japanese Laid-open Patent application No. 63-254196. However, these modifiers have disadvantages which result in a decreasing coefficient of friction at the lock-up clutch in a low sliding velocity range, and in insufficient transmission torque when the clutch is connected.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Use of metallic detergents and ashless depressants has been proposed, as disclosed by Japanese Laid-open Patent application Nos. 5-105892, 6-271883, 8-127789 and 8-319494, to increase transmission torque capacity.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, however, few lubricants have exhibited sufficient friction-related properties, even in the presence of the above additives.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      As discussed above, the  MU -V characteristics trade off with transmission torque capacity, and it is necessary to increase transmission torque capacity while keeping a positive  MU -V relationship.
      <br/>
      As a result, there have been demands increasingly for the technique to increase coefficient of friction in a high sliding velocity.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">It is an object of the present invention to provide a lubricant oil composition for an automatic and continuously variable transmission, which exhibits a sufficient coefficient of friction in a high sliding velocity range in an automatic and continuously variable transmission with a built-in torque converter equipped with a lock-up clutch.</p>
    <p num="12">It has been discovered that the lubricant composition for an automatic and continuously variable transmission exhibits a sufficient coefficient of friction in a high sliding velocity range while keeping the lubricant characteristics required by these transmissions, when the lubricant base oil is incorporated with an adequate but minor quantity of an additive which contains at least one type of cyclic carboxylic acid imide having boron in the molecule and substituted by hydrocarbyl groups selected from the group consisting of alkyl group(s), alkenyl group(s), and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="13">The present invention provides a lubricant oil composition for an automatic and continuously variable transmissions equipped with a slip-controlled, lock-up clutch, which exhibits a sufficient coefficient of friction in a high sliding velocity range by incorporating in the base oil an additive which contains at least one type of cyclic carboxylic acid imide, containing a specific boron species in the molecule and substituted by hydrocarbyl group(s) selected from the group consisting of alkyl or alkenyl group(s) and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention relates, as described above, to a lubricant oil composition comprising a major amount of a base oil incorporated with a minor amount of specific additive.
      <br/>
      Some of the preferred embodiments are described below:
    </p>

    <p num="20">The present invention is described in more detail, below:</p>
    <p num="21">(1) Lubricant Base Oil</p>
    <p num="22">
      The base oil for the lubricant oil composition of the present invention for an automatic and continuously variable transmission is not limited, and any oil commonly used as a base oil can be used.
      <br/>
      It may be a mineral or synthetic oil, or a mixture thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The mineral oil may be a raffinate derived from a naphthenic or paraffinic crude oil, where the lubricant stock from the atmospheric or vacuum residue is extracted with an adequate aromatic solvent, e.g., phenol, furfural or N-methylpyrrolidone to produce the raffinate.
      <br/>
      It may be a hydrotreated oil, derived from the above lubricant stock which is subjected to a hydrotreatment process including hydrocracking, or isomerate obtained by bringing wax into contact with hydrogen under isomerization conditions in the presence of an isomerization catalyst.
      <br/>
      It may be also a lubricant fraction which is treated by solvent extraction combined with hydrotreating and/or isomerization.
      <br/>
      In each case, one or more additional processes, e.g., dewaxing, hydrofinishing and clay treatment effected under known conditions, may be optionally used.
      <br/>
      The examples of mineral base oils include light, medium and heavy neutral oils, and bright stock, which can be mixed with each other, as adequate, to satisfy the required properties.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The examples of synthetic base oils include poly-alpha-olefin, alpha-olefin oligomer, polybutene, alkylbenzene, polyol ester, dibasic acid ester, polyoxyalkylene glycol, polyoxyalkylene glycol ether, and silicone oil.</p>
    <p num="25">
      These base oils may be used individually or in combination.
      <br/>
      A mineral oil may be combined with a synthetic oil.
      <br/>
      The base oil for the present invention generally has a kinematic viscosity of 2 to 20 mm2 /s at 100 (degree)  C., preferably 3 to 15 mm2 /s.
      <br/>
      Viscosity beyond the above range causes problems, e.g., insufficient viscosity at low temperature when it exceeds the above range, and increased friction at sliding members (e.g., a gear, bearing and clutch in an automatic transmission) when it is below the above range.
    </p>

      It is generally accepted that a lubricant oil composition for an automatic and continuously variable transmission, with a built-in torque converter equipped with a lock-up clutch, has a positive  MU -V relationship by use of a compound capable of modifying viscosity to decrease coefficient of friction in a low sliding velocity range.
      <br/>
      However, decreased coefficient of friction in a low sliding velocity range results in decreased transmission torque capacity, which, however, is inconsistent with the development objective to secure a high transmission torque capacity.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there have been great demands for friction modifier compounds which can increase coefficient of friction in a high sliding velocity range without greatly decreasing the coefficient in a low sliding velocity range, and, at the same time, secure a positive  MU -V relationship.
      <br/>
      The development target has been set to obtain a lubricant oil composition which exhibits a coefficient of friction ( MU 300) above 0.130 at a high sliding velocity, as realized in Examples described in this specification.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      Examples and Comparative Examples described in this specification show that the lubricant oil composition of this invention, incorporated with, as the essential component, a given concentration of a cyclic carboxylic acid imide having boron in the molecule and substituted by an alkyl or alkenyl group exhibits a high coefficient of friction at the high sliding velocity, satisfies the target set for the lubricant composition for an automatic and continuously variable transmission, and is of high-quality.
      <br/>
      Taking, as an example, the results of Example 1, the lubricant oil composition shows a coefficient of friction of 0.158 at the high sliding velocity, which is higher than the target of 0.130, and should exhibit excellent power transmission capacity.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the high-quality lubricant oil compositions for an automatic and continuously variable transmission are obtained in Examples 2 through 8.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      On the other hand, the composition obtained by Comparative Example 1, which lacks the essential component for the present invention has a coefficient of friction of 0.096 at the high sliding velocity, which is below the target.
      <br/>
      Comparative Examples 2 and 3 use specific concentrations of cyclic carboxylic acid imides which are represented by the general formula (1) except that they contain no boron, although substituted by an alkyl or alkenyl group.
      <br/>
      The compositions prepared in these examples have respective coefficients of friction of 0.119 and 0.120 at the high sliding velocity, failing to satisfy the target coefficient similarly to that prepared in Comparative Example 1.
      <br/>
      Comparative Examples 4 and 5 use specific concentrations of cyclic carboxylic acid imides which are represented by the general formula (2) except that they contain no boron, although substituted by an alkyl or alkenyl group.
      <br/>
      The compositions prepared in these examples have respective coefficients of friction of 0.115 and 0.110 at the high sliding velocity, failing to satisfy the target coefficient similarly to those prepared in the Comparative Examples 1 to 3.
      <br/>
      Comparative Examples 6 and 7 use specific concentrations of cyclic carboxylic acid imides which are represented by the general formula (3) except that they contain no boron, although substituted by an alkyl or alkenyl group, and Comparative Examples 8 and 9 use specific concentrations of cyclic carboxylic acid imides which are represented by the general formula (4) except that they contain no boron, although substituted by an alkyl or alkenyl group (i.e., boron-free succinimides substituted by an alkenyl group, which are commonly incorporated in lubricant compositions).
      <br/>
      The compositions prepared by these examples fail to satisfy the target coefficient, similarly to those prepared by the Comparative Examples 1 to 5.
      <br/>
      Comparative Examples 10 and 11 use specific concentrations of polyisobutylenes instead of the essential component for the present invention, i.e., cyclic carboxylic acid imides having boron species in the molecule and substituted by an alkyl or alkenyl group.
      <br/>
      The compositions prepared in these examples fail to satisfy the target coefficient, similarly to those prepared by the Comparative Examples 1 to 9, because their coefficients of friction are 0.092 and 0.090, respectively, in a high sliding velocity range.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      It is apparent, as described above, that a lubricant oil composition is not of high quality as the one for an automatic or continuously variable transmission, because of its insufficient coefficient of friction in a high sliding velocity range, unless it contains a cyclic carboxylic acid imide having boron in the molecule and substituted by an alkyl or alkenyl group, as the essential component for the present invention.
      <br/>
      In other words, it is possible to provide a high-quality lubricant oil composition by incorporating, in a lubricant base oil, a cyclic carboxylic acid imide (which is represented by succinimide) having boron in the molecule and substituted by an alkyl or alkenyl, in order to increase coefficient of friction in a high sliding velocity range, without greatly decreasing the composition in a low sliding velocity range.
