      A draw latch for attaching one member to another, such as a first panel to a second panel, is unlatched and latched by lifting the latch handle in one direction or the other about a pivot axis, which actuates a pawl member which is pivoted to engage and secure a first catch of a keeper, the handle being pivoted to be secured on a second catch of a keeper, with the pawl being latched against a spring bias provided by a keeper member.
      <br/>
      The handle is securable by a lock which locks the handle to the second catch to prevent release of the pawl from engagement with the first catch.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to the field of latches, and more particularly to a draw latch.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Brief Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A variety of draw latches are known for providing a latching action which is achieved by drawing a clamping member against, or over, another member.
      <br/>
      Generally, a keeper member is mounted to one panel surface and a clamping member of the latch, which is mounted on a second panel surface, engages the keeper and draws the panels together when the clamping member is drawn toward or over the latch body.
      <br/>
      Draw latches essentially are comprised of a handle assembly and a keeper.
      <br/>
      The handle assembly generally includes the components of the base, a lever and a catch, with the base and lever being pivotally connected to each other, and with the catch and lever being pivotally connected to each other.
      <br/>
      In operation, the handle assembly is adapted to be mounted onto a first panel member and the keeper is adapted to be mounted on a second panel member and is designed to receive the catch for latching.
      <br/>
      Generally, when the catch engages the keeper, a downward force is applied to the lever which causes the catch to pull the panels together and into a fastened position.
      <br/>
      In essence, the latching action is achieved by rotating the lever about a pivot axis.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the art of over-center draw latches, it is known to provide a draw latch having a base member a lever and a catch.
      <br/>
      The base and lever are pivotally connected to each other with the catch and lever being pivotally connected to each other.
      <br/>
      The pivotal connections are generally at the locations of the shafts.
      <br/>
      Prior art latches of this type, although effective for securing one or more members or panels together, have an undesirable effect of freely movable members.
      <br/>
      In order to enable the components of this type of latch to be retained in open positions, a technique used includes applying a plastic resistance member between the pivot shaft pivotally connecting the lever and base, and the pivot shaft that connects the lever and the catch.
      <br/>
      This plastic member provides a sufficient frictional resistance between these pivot shafts, that it will maintain the basic three components in various positions, relative to each other.
      <br/>
      However, such a plastic member comprises essentially a fourth component which can increase cost and the work associated with assembly of the latch.
      <br/>
      Generally, the additional plastic member has been replaced, and dimples or detents used to provide a resistance to keep the members of the latch assembly in a variety of given positions.
      <br/>
      For example, an over-center draw latch having a base and lever pivotally connected to each other, with a catch being pivotally connected to the lever is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,890,869 "Over-Center Draw Latch", the complete disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the operation of draw latches, the handle assembly is adapted to be mounted onto a first panel member and the keeper is adapted to be mounted on a second panel member.
      <br/>
      The keeper is further designed to receive the catch for latching.
      <br/>
      When the catch engages the keeper, a downward force is applied to the lever which causes the catch to pull the panels together into a fastened position.
      <br/>
      In such a latch, the latching action is achieved by rotating the lever to shift the pivotal connection of the catch and the lever in relation to a line extending between the keeper and the point of pivotal connection of the lever and base.
      <br/>
      Generally, there are two distinct latching actions for such latches, namely, over-center and under-center.
      <br/>
      An over-center action provides the pivot connection of the lever and the catch below the centerline between the base and the keeper when in the fastened position.
      <br/>
      With respect to an under-center action, the pivot of the lever and the catch is positioned above the centerline of the base and the keeper when fastened.
      <br/>
      For unlatching, an upward force is applied to the lever in order to provide rotation of the lever in the direction opposite that for latching.
      <br/>
      A disadvantage with conventional draw latches however is that following rotation of the lever for unlatching; the catch must manually be raised in order to be disengaged from the keeper.
      <br/>
      In one type of draw latch known, a spring which automatically raises or provides "kick-out" of the catch from the keeper when unlatched is utilized.
      <br/>
      However, in this type of draw latch, the catch movement generally cannot be controlled.
      <br/>
      For example, when unlatched, the spring operates to force the catch from the keeper in all instances, even in those situations where it is desirable to have the catch remain in other positions.
      <br/>
      An example of a draw latch which addresses and overcomes such drawbacks is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,125, "Draw Latch With Catch Having Kick-Out Action" wherein controlled kick-out action of the latching member is featured, the complete disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another example of a draw latch assembly includes a base and a handle and an underlying pawl.
      <br/>
      The handle is rotated to secure the latch in a latching position by moving the underlying pawl member therewith.
      <br/>
      In this type of latch assembly, the handle does not itself secure to a keeper.
      <br/>
      The latching is accomplished by the pawl securing to a keeper member.

    <p num="8">Other prior known draw latches are provided for use in panels wherein a gasketing member is provided on the panel to supply a biasing force.</p>

      <br/>
      The pawl 17 is lifted and secured on the pawl pin 24.
      <br/>
      The lifting of the handle 13 toward engagement with the secondary catch 14 forces the pawl 17 downward to securely engage the pawl pin 24.
      <br/>
      The spring members 36,37 of the keeper 11 provide a bias which acts upon the pawl 17 as it is pivoted from its FIG. 4 position to its latched position, and continues upon latching of the pawl 17 with the pawl pin or catch 24.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      An interference means 60 can preferably be provided between the pawl 17 and the handle 13.
      <br/>
      For example, the pawl 17 can be provided with a protruding configuration, such as a raised boss, or can be provided with an enlarged width as shown in FIGS. to create friction between the handle 13 as the handle 13 is pivoted.
      <br/>
      The interference means permits the latch 10 to be unlatched with the pawl 17 remaining in a partially pivoted position, such as that shown in FIG. 3.
