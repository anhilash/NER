      A Mn-Zn ferrite having large electrical resistance, which can withstand the use in high frequency region exceeding 1 MHz, is provided.
      <br/>
      The Mn-Zn ferrite comprises the following basic components: 44.0 to 50.0 mol % Fe2O3, 4.0 to 26.5 mol % ZnO, 0.1 to 8.0 mol % at least one member selected from the group consisting of TiO2 and SnO2, 0.1 to 16.0 mol % CuO, and the remainder being MnO.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a soft magnetic material, particularly a Mn--Zn ferrite suitable for low loss material for a transformer for switching power supply, a rotary transformer and deflection yoke, electronic parts such as for various kind of inductance elements and impedance elements for countermeasure against EMI, or for electromagnetic wave absorbers.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The representative oxide magnetic material having a soft magnetism includes Mn--Zn ferrite.
      <br/>
      Conventionally, this Mn--Zn ferrite generally has a basic component composition containing more than 50 mol %, 52 to 55 mol % on the average, of Fe2 O3, 10 to 24 mol % of ZnO and the remainder being MnO.
      <br/>
      In general, the Mn--Zn ferrite is produced by mixing each of raw material powders of Fe2 O3, ZnO and MnO in predetermined proportions, forming a predetermined shape through the steps of calcination, milling, component adjustment, granulation and pressing, and then conducting a sintering treatment by maintaining the green compact at 1,200 to 1,400 (degree)  C. for 3 to 4 hours in reducing atmosphere which suppresses an oxygen concentration by flowing nitrogen.
      <br/>
      The reasons for sintering in reducing atmosphere are as follows.
      <br/>
      If the green compact is sintered in air when Fe2 O3 contains more than 50 mol %, densification does not proceed sufficiently, so that preferable soft magnetism is not obtained.
      <br/>
      Further, Fe2+ formed by reduction of Fe3+ has a positive crystal magnetic anisotropy, and has an effect to erase a negative crystal magnetic anisotropy of Fe3+, thereby improving a soft magnetism.
      <br/>
      However, if sintering is conducted in an air, such a reductive reaction cannot be expected.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Where a Mn--Zn ferrite is used as a magnetic core material, eddy current flows as a frequency region used increases, and loss by the eddy current increases accordingly.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in order to increase the upper limit of the frequency which can be used for a magnetic core material, it is necessary to make its electrical resistance large as much as possible.
      <br/>
      However, the electrical resistance in the above-described general Mn--Zn ferrite is a value smaller than 1  OMEGA m due to enjoyment of electrons between the above-described Fe2+ and Fe2+ (interionic), and the frequency which can be used is limited up to approximately several hundreds of kHz.
      <br/>
      Initial permeability is considerably decreased in the frequency region exceeding 1 MHz, and properties as the soft magnetic material are completely lost.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In some instances, however, such a countermeasure is taken that in order to increase the electrical resistance of Mn--Zn ferrite, CaO, SiO2 and the like are added as additives to the above-described main components to make the resistance of grain boundary high, and also sintering is conducted at a low temperature of approximately 1,200 (degree)  C. to reduce the grain size up to approximately 5  MU m, thereby increasing the proportion of the grain boundary.
      <br/>
      However, it is difficult to obtain electrical resistance exceeding 1  OMEGA m even with such a countermeasure, and a fundamental solution is not yet attained.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">Embodiment</p>
    <p num="18">
      The present invention newly contains CuO and at least one member selected from the group consisting of SnO2 and TiO2, in addition to Fe2 O3, ZnO and MnO which are basic components of the conventional Mn--Zn ferrite in order to provide a Mn--Zn ferrite which can sufficiently withstand the use in a high frequency region exceeding 1 MHz.
      <br/>
      The basic components are a composition comprising 44.0 to 50.0 mol % Fe2 O3, 4.0 to 26.5 mol % ZnO, 0.1 to 8.0 mol % at least one member selected from the group consisting of SnO2 and TiO2, 0.1 to 16.0 mol % CuO, and the remainder being MnO.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Iron components in the Mn--Zn ferrite are present as Fe3+ and Fe2+. It is known that Ti and Sn receive electrons from Fe3+ to form Fe2+. Therefore, by containing those components, Fe2+ can be formed even by sintering in air.
      <br/>
      The present invention makes it possible to obtain an excellent soft magnetism such that the contents of TiO2 and/or SnO2 in the basic component composition are made 0.1 to 8.0 mol %, thereby controlling the amount of Fe2+ formed and optimizing the presence ratio of Fe3+ and Fe2+, so that positive and negative crystal magnetic anisotropies are compensated.
      <br/>
      Further, according to the present invention, since many Ti4+ and Sn4+ having the stable number of valency are present, exchange of electrons between Fe3+ and Fe2+ are substantially inhibited, and as a result, electrical resistance far larger than the conventional one (about 103 times) can be obtained.
      <br/>
      However, if the content of TiO2 and/or SnO2 is less than 0.1 mol %, its effect becomes small, and on the other hand, if it exceeds 8.0 mol %, the initial permeability is decreased.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the content is limited to the above range of 0.1 to 8.0 mol %.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As described above, the present invention can obtain a sufficient soft magnetism even by sintering in air, but in order to further improve the soft magnetism, it is desirable to limit the Fe2 O3 content to 50 mol % or less, thereby promoting the densification.
      <br/>
      However, if Fe2 O3 content is too small, it causes decrease in initial permeability.
      <br/>
      Therefore, Fe2 O3 should contain at least 44.0 mol %.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      ZnO influences curie temperature and saturation magnetization.
      <br/>
      If ZnO is too large, the curie temperature is lowered, resulting in a practical problem.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if it is too small, saturation magnetization is decreased.
      <br/>
      Therefore, ZnO is desirable to be in the above-described range of 4.0 to 26.5 mol %.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      CuO enables a low temperature sintering.
      <br/>
      However, if CuO is too small, its effect is small.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if it is too large, the initial permeability is decreased.
      <br/>
      Therefore, CuO is desirable to be in the above-described range of 0.1 to 16.0 mol %.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      It is known that CaO and SiO2 make the grain boundary high resistance as described above.
      <br/>
      It is also known that those have the function to promote sintering of Mn--Zn ferrite.
      <br/>
      Therefore, adding CaO and SiO2 as additives to the above-described basic component composition is effective in obtaining a highly dense magnetic material.
      <br/>
      In order to obtain the desired effect, it is necessary to contain CaO and SiO2 in an amount of 0.005 mass % or more.
      <br/>
      However, if the amount thereof added is too large, abnormal grain growth occurs.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the upper limit of CaO should be 0.200 mass % and that of SiO2 should be 0.050 mass %.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The Mn--Zn ferrite according to the present invention may contain at least one member selected from the group consisting of V2 O5, Bi2 O3, In2 O3, PbO, MoO3 and WO3 as additives.
      <br/>
      These additives each is an oxide having a low melting point and has a function to promote sintering.
      <br/>
      However, if the content of these components is small, its effect is small, and on the other hand, if it is too large, the abnormal grain growth occurs.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the content of V2 O5 is desirable to be 0.010-0.200 mass %; Bi2 O3, In2 O3, PbO 0.005-0.100 mass %; and WO3 0.001-0.050 mass %.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The Mn--Zn ferrite according to the present invention may contain at least one member selected from the group consisting of ZrO2, Ta2 O5, HfO2, Nb2 O5 and Y2 O3 as additives.
      <br/>
      These additives each is an oxide having high melting point and has a function to suppress grain growth.
      <br/>
      If crystal grains become small, electrical resistance is increased.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the initial permeability in high frequency region can be improved by containing those additives in appropriate amount.
      <br/>
      However, if the content of those components is small, its effect is small, and on the other hand, if it is too large, the initial permeability is decreased.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the content of each of those components is desirable to be 0.010 to 0.200 mass %.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The Mn--Zn ferrite according to the present invention may contain at least one of Cr2 O3 and Al2 O3 as additives.
      <br/>
      Those additives have the function to improve temperature characteristic of initial permeability.
      <br/>
      However, if the content thereof is too small, its effect is small, and on the other hand, if it is too large, the permeability is decreased.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the content of each of those components is desirable to be 0.020 to 0.300 mass %.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In producing Mn--Zn ferrite, each raw material powder of Fe2 O3, ZnO, TiO2 and/or SnO2, CuO and MnO as the main components are previously weighed in the predetermined proportions, and those are mixed to obtain a mixed powder.
      <br/>
      This powder is calcined and finely milled.
      <br/>
      The calcination temperature described above can select an appropriate temperature within the range of 850 to 950 (degree)  C., although varying depending on the objective composition.
      <br/>
      Further, the fine milling of the mixed powder can be conducted with widely used ball mills.
      <br/>
      If desired and necessary, the powder of the above-described various additives are added in predetermined amount to the mixed fine powder and mixed to obtain a mixed powder having the objective composition.
      <br/>
      Granulation and pressing are conducted according to the conventional ferrite production process, and sintering is then conducted to obtain a sintered product.
      <br/>
      The above-described granulation is conducted by adding binders such as polyvinyl alcohols, polyacryl amides, methyl cellulose, polyethylene oxides or glycerin, and the like.
      <br/>
      Further, the pressing is conducted by applying a pressure of, for example, 80 MPa or more.
      <br/>
      Further, sintering is conducted by, for example, a method of maintaining at a temperature of, for example, 1,000 to 1,300 (degree)  C. for an appropriate temperature in air.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The Mn--Zn ferrite thus obtained contains SnO2 and/or TiO2 as the main components.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the electrical resistance is markedly increased as compared with the conventional Mn--Zn ferrite (approx. 103 times).
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In general, the limit of the initial permeability  MU  in a soft magnetic ferrite is inversely proportional to a frequency f (MHz) at which the ferrite is used, and is estimated by the value given by the equation of
      <br/>
      MU =K/f (K=1,500-2,000).
    </p>
    <p num="30">According to the Mn--Zn ferrite of the present invention, the initial permeability of 300-400 as estimated in the frequency of 5 MHz can be obtained, and the ferrite is suitable as magnetic core materials and electromagnetic wave absorbers for high frequency exceeding 1 MHz.</p>
    <p num="31">The present invention is described in more detail by reference to the following Examples, but the invention should not be limited thereto.</p>
    <p num="32">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="33">

      <br/>
      The resulting mixture was calcined at 900 (degree)  C. for 2 hours in air, and then milled with ball mill for 20 hours to obtain a mixed powder.
      <br/>
      This mixed powder was adjusted to the components so as to have the above-described composition, and further mixed with ball mill for 1 hour.
      <br/>
      Polyvinyl alcohol was added to this mixed powder, and granulated.
      <br/>
      The resulting granulates were pressed into toroidal cores each having an outer diameter of 18 mm, an inner diameter of 10 mm and a height of 4 mm under a pressure of 80 MPa.
      <br/>
      Each green compact was placed in a sintering furnace, and sintered at 1,000 (degree)  C. for 3 hours in air to obtain Samples 1-1 to 1-7 as shown in Table 1.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      For the sake of comparison, each raw material powder was mixed with ball mill such that Fe2 O3 was 52.5 mol %, MnO was 24. 2 mol %, and ZnO was 23.3 mol %.

      Further, Sample 1-6 as the comparative sample has the Fe2 O3 content as small as 44.0 mol % or less, so that the initial permeability thereof at 500 kHz and 5 MHz is far lower as compared with that of the samples of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Further, Sample 1-8 having the Fe2 O3 content of larger than 50 mol % as the same as in the conventional one is that the initial permeability at 5 MHz is decreased to the level 1 of the permeability of vacuum magnetic constant, and thus completely loses the characteristics as a soft magnetic material.

      From the results shown in Table 7, in Samples 7-1, 7-2 and 7-4 to 7-6 (the samples of the present invention) containing Cr2 O3 and Al2 O3 in an appropriate amount, the temperature factor of initial permeability becomes small to the grain size of Sample 1-3 which does not contain those components at all (the sample of the present invention in Example 1), and temperature characteristic is improved.
      <br/>
      However, in the sample containing additives in relatively large amount as in Sample 7-3 (comparative sample), the temperature factor of initial permeability becomes small, but the initial permeability is decreased.

      As described above, the Mn--Zn ferrite according to the present invention can obtain markedly large electrical resistance and excellent initial permeability as compared with the conventional Mn--Zn ferrite, and can sufficiently withstand the use in the high frequency region exceeding 1 MHz.
      <br/>
      Thus, the Mn--Zn ferrite is suitable as magnetic core materials and electromagnetic wave absorbers for high frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      Further, the Mn--Zn ferrite according to the present invention enables Mn--Zn ferrite having the Fe2 O3 content of 50 mol % or less to sinter in the air by containing TiO2 and SnO2, and also enables it to sinter at low temperature by containing CuO.
      <br/>
      As a result, the Mn--Zn ferrite greatly contributes to improvement in productivity, and decrease in production cost.
