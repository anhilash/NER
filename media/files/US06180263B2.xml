      The hard carbon coating-clad base material of the present invention comprises a base material, a substratal metal coating formed on the base material by a wet plating process, an intermediate metal coating comprising a titanium or chromium coating formed on the substratal metal coating by a dry plating process and a silicon coating formed on the titanium or chromium coating by a dry plating process, and a hard carbon coating formed on the silicon coating by a dry plating process.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, a highly reliable hard carbon coating which is excellent in corrosion resistance, adhesion and abrasion resistance can be formed even on brass or an iron base material having poor corrosion resistance, such as SK steel and martensitic and ferritic stainless steels.

      In recent years, the hard carbon coating is attracting attention because it has excellent properties, e.g., high hardness, high insulation, high thermal conductivity and chemical stability, similar to those of diamond.
      <br/>
      For the formation of the hard carbon coating, already, the physical vapor deposition method (hereinafter referred to as "PVD"), such as the ion beam method, the sputtering method and the ion plating method, the ECR (Electron Cyclotron Resonance) and the RF (Radio Frecuency) plasma chemical-vapor deposition method (hereinafter referred to as "RFP-CVD") have been brought into practical use.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Generally, a compressive stress as high as about 1010 dyne/cm2 remains in the hard carbon coatings formed by the above methods.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the base material provided with the hard carbon coating formed by any of the above methods has such drawbacks that the adhesion between the hard carbon coating and the base material, especially when the base material is composed of a metal, is so poor that peeling or cracking is caused to shorten its life, or the formation of the hard carbon coating on the base material is infeasible.
      <br/>
      That is, although the hard carbon coating can be formed on the surface of a silicon base material or a super hard material by any of the above methods, it is difficult to form the hard carbon coating on the surface of any of various metal base materials, such as stainless steel base materials.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the problem exists that the types of the base materials on which the hard carbon coating can be formed are very limited.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 116767/1987 (Japanese Patent Application No. 256426/1985), the inventors proposed a hard carbon coating-clad base material in which an intermediate layer composed of a lower layer mainly composed of chromium or titanium, formed on the surface of a base material by a dry plating process, and an upper layer mainly composed of silicon or germanium, formed on the surface of the lower layer by a dry plating process, is disposed between a metal base material and the hard carbon coating.
      <br/>
      Further, the inventors also proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 149673/1990 (Japanese Patent Application No. 301829/1988) a hard carbon coating-clad base material in which a solid solution layer is formed at the interface of the above upper and lower layers constituting the intermediate layer by counter diffusion.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      However, still in the hard carbon coating-clad base material proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 149673/1990, the types of the base materials on which the hard carbon coating can be formed are limited.
      <br/>
      For example, when brass is employed as the base material, dezincing from the brass occurs in a vacuum atmosphere due to the rise in the temperature inside the chamber at the time of the formation of the above intermediate layer or the formation of the hard carbon coating, so that the surface of the brass base material turn into orange peel to thereby lower the corrosion resistance of the surface of the base material and the adhesion between the brass base material and the hard carbon coating.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the problem exists that, when brass is used as the base material of the hard carbon coating-clad base material proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 149673/1990, it is infeasible to fully utilize the excellent properties of the hard carbon coating.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Moreover, among iron materials Including a carbon Wool steel such as SK steel as defined in JIS G 4401 (1983), a martensitic stainless steel and ferritic stainless steel, when an iron material having poorer corrosion resistance than that of an austenitic stainless such as SUS 304 is used as the base material, corrosion due to rusting occurs in the base material after pre-wash to thereby cause the problem with respect to the adhesion between the base material and the hard carbon coating and the corrosion resistance of the hard carbon coating.
      <br/>
      The terminology "pre-wash" used herein means subjecting the base material to organic cleaning by using methylene chloride, etc., or subjecting the base material to alkaline degreasing cleaning by using alkali solution of 5-10%, and thereafter, to neutralization treatment by using nitric acid solution of 5-10%.
      <br/>
      In these pre-wash treatments, ultrasonic washer is jointly used.

    <p num="13">Hereinbelow, the hard carbon coating-clad base material according to the present invention will be explained in greater detail.</p>
    <p num="14">The hard carbon coating-clad base material according to a first aspect of the present invention comprises:</p>

      a base material,

      <br/>
      an intermediate metal coating comprising a titanium coating formed on the substratal metal coating by a dry plating process and a silicon coating formed on the titanium coating by a dry plating process, and

      a hard carbon coating formed on the silicon coating by a dry plating process.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Further, the hard carbon coating-clad base material according to a second aspect of the present invention comprises:
      <br/>
      a base material,
      <br/>
      a substratal metal coating formed on the base material by a wet plating process,
      <br/>
      an intermediate metal coating comprising a chromium coating formed on the substratal metal coating by a dry plating process and a silicon coating formed on the chromium coating by a dry plating process, and
      <br/>
      a hard carbon coating formed on the silicon coating by a dry plating process.
    </p>
    <p num="17">As the above base material, metal materials having poor corrosion resistance may be mentioned which include, for example, brass, SK steel, a martensitic stainless steel and a ferritic stainless steel.</p>
    <p num="18">The above substratal metal coating is preferably at least one coating selected from the group consisting of a nickel alloy coating, a nickel coating, a chromium coating, a palladium coating, a combination of a nickel alloy coating and a chromium coating, and a combination of a nickel alloy coating and a palladium coating.</p>
    <p num="19">
      This substratal metal coating is formed on the above base material by a wet plating process.
      <br/>
      In particular, the substratal metal coating can be formed on the base material by the use of a plating bath containing ions of the metal for composing the substratal coating.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Examples of nickel alloy coatings include a nickel-phosphorus alloy coating, a nickel-palladium alloy coating, a nickel-boron alloy coating, and a nickel-tin alloy coating.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Formation of the palladium coating on the base material is suitable when a base material having poor corrosion resistance, such as a copper alloy material is used.
      <br/>
      Formation of the chromium coating on the base material is suitable when a base material requiring abrasion resistance is used.
      <br/>
      However, when chromium plating cannot be performed for the problem, such as waste water treatment, the nickel coating may be applied by the use of nickel plating.
      <br/>
      Further, when the hard carbon coating-clad base material is utilized under conditions such that corrosion resistance is requisite, it is feasible to attain further improvement of corrosion resistance by forming the palladium coating on the nickel alloy coating.
      <br/>
      Still further, when both high hardness and abrasion resistance are required, a hard carbon coating-clad base material having the required high hardness and abrasion resistance can be produced with relatively low cost by forming the chromium coating on the nickel alloy coating.
      <br/>
      Still further, when all of high hardness, abrasion resistance and corrosion resistance are required, it is preferred that the chromium coating be formed on the nickel alloy coating and then the palladium coating be formed on the chromium coating.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In the present invention, the corrosion resistance of a base material, such as those of brass, SK steel, a martensitic stainless steel and a ferritic stainless steel, is improved by directly forming the above substratal metal coating on the base material.
      <br/>
      Further, when the substratal metal coating is subjected to an aging treatment, the hardness of the substratal metal coating is increased to thereby attain further utilization of the characteristics of the hard carbon coating.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In the present invention, the titanium coating is formed on the above substratal metal coating by a dry plating process.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the silicon coating is formed on the titanium coating by a dry plating process to thereby form the intermediate metal coating composed of the titanium coating and the silicon coating.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Further, in the present invention, the intermediate metal coating composed of the chromium coating and the silicon coating can be formed by forming the chromium coating on the above substratal metal coating according to a dry plating process and then forming the silicon coating on the chromium coating according to a dry plating process.</p>
    <p num="25">These intermediate metal coatings are formed by the dry plating process, which is, for example, PVD, such as the ion beam process, the sputtering process and the ion plating process, ECR or RF-CVD.</p>
    <p num="26">That is, the above two-layer intermediate metal coatings are individually composed of the titanium or chromium coating formed on the above substratal metal coating by a dry plating process and the silicon coating formed on the titanium or chromium coating by a dry plating process.</p>
    <p num="27">Further, in the present invention, either the intermediate metal coating composed of successive layers of the titanium, chromium and silicon coatings can be formed by successively superimposing the titanium, chromium and silicon coatings on the substratal metal coating according to a dry plating process, or the intermediate metal coating composed of successive layers of the chromium, titanium and silicon coatings can be formed by successively superimposing the chromium, titanium and silicon coatings on the substratal metal coating according to a dry plating process.</p>
    <p num="28">By virtue of the above intermediate metal coatings, the hard carbon coating can be effectively formed on a metal base material, and, especially, the hard carbon coating having excellent corrosion resistance, abrasion resistance and adhesion can be formed on a metal base material having poor corrosion resistance.</p>
    <p num="29">In the present invention, the hard carbon coating is formed on the silicon coating which is an upper layer of the above intermediate metal coating by a dry plating process.</p>
    <p num="30">The formation of the hard carbon coating on the intermediate metal coating can be carried out by the same dry plating process as employed in the formation of the intermediate metal coating.</p>
    <p num="31">The hard carbon coating-clad base material having excellent corrosion resistance, abrasion resistance and adhesion can be obtained by the above formation of the hard carbon coating.</p>

      FIG. 1 is a view showing a cross section of an essential portion of a preferred feature of the hard carbon coating-clad base material according to the present invention.

      When titanium, silicon and hard carbon coatings are successively formed on a base material of SK steel according to a dry plating process, not only does corrosion occur after the pre-wash step but also tiny peelings are observed on the hard carbon coating after the formation thereof by the use of a metallurgical microscope.

      When titanium, silicon and hard carbon coatings are successively formed on a base material of brass according to a dry plating process, the adhesion between the base material and the hard carbon coating is poor due to dezincing from the brass base material, thereby lowering the corrosion resistance of the hard carbon coating.

    <p num="143">
      From a comparison of the results of this Comparative Example to those of Example 5, it is apparent that it is important to carry out the formation of the chromium coating as the intermediate metal coating by the dry plating process.
      <br/>
      Illustratively stated, in the wet plating process, an oxide is formed on the surface of the chromium coating to thereby cause the adhesion between the chromium coating and the silicon coating to become poor.
      <br/>
      By contrast, when the formation of the chromium coating as the intermediate metal coating is performed by the dry plating process, the chromium and silicon coatings can be formed in the same batch in a vacuum atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the above oxide formation does not occur, so that the adhesion between the chromium and silicon coatings is markedly excellent.

    <heading>EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="144">
      The hard carbon coating-clad base material of the present invention comprises a base material, a substratal metal coating formed on the base material by a wet plating process, an intermediate metal coating comprising a titanium or chromium coating formed on the substratal metal coating by a dry plating process and a silicon coating formed on the titanium or chromium coating by a dry plating process, and a hard carbon coating formed on the silicon coating by a dry plating process.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, a highly reliable hard carbon coating which is excellent in corrosion resistance, adhesion and abrasion resistance can be formed even on an iron base material having poor corrosion resistance, such as brass, SK steel and martensitic and ferritic stainless steels.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      In particular, the abrasion resistance of the hard carbon coating is especially excellent in a hard carbon coating-clad base material in which the substratal metal coating of a nickel-phosphorus alloy coating has been subjected to an aging treatment and a hard carbon coating-clad base material in which the intermediate metal coating is composed of a chromium coating and a silicon coating.
      <br/>
      In the case of a base material, such as brass, with which the aging treatment of the nickel-phosphorus alloy coating cannot exhibit satisfactory effect, a hard carbon coating-clad base material having excellent abrasion resistance can be obtained by forming a chromium coating as the substratal metal coating on the nickel phosphorus alloy coating by a wet plating process in place of the aging treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="146">As apparent from the foregoing, the hard carbon coating-clad base material of the present invention has a great advantage in that the scope of the types of available base materials is increased over the prior art to thereby broaden the fields of application of the hard carbon coating.</p>
