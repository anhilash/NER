      The forms of inverse deviation weighting are implemented for representing forms of residual weighting and forms of implied squared residual weighting.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="5">The present invention relates to automated forms of data processing, more particularly to data reduction in correspondence with multiple-term parametric relationships.</p>
    <p num="6">2. Brief Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="7">
      Heretofore, efforts to fit nonlinear parametric relationships to experimental data have relied heavily upon approximations that incorporate least-squares data reduction techniques in formulating independent equations by minimizing sums of parametrically represented squared residuals or squared deviations with respect to included fitting parameters.
      <br/>
      Equations, which are thus formulated, will not consistently compensate for significant errors in variables which are included in more than a single term of a parametrically represented approximating relationship.
      <br/>
      Even considering forms of "Discriminate Reduction Data Processing" (ref. L. Chandler, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,652,713 &amp; 5,619,432), and least-squares techniques which provide for the evaluating of over-determined systems of equations, as may be represented by minimum norm solutions of "Total Least Squares" analysis (ref. L. Scharf, Statistical Signal Processing, Addison-Wesley, New York, pp 495-496, 1991), or by originally conceived forms of "Conformal Analysis" (ref. L. Chandler, ibid.), the prior art of establishing independent equations for parameter evaluating seems to offer no generally valid techniques for providing inherently appropriate analytically represented data function similitude as statistically represented by multiple nonlinear, generally non-orthogonal terms of approximating relationships.
      <br/>
      The terminology "least-squares techniques" herein refers to those techniques which are incorporated in processes which involve establishing form for entire sets of independent equations by minimizing representations of sums of squared residuals or represented squared deviations which may or may not be individually weighted.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The art of generating weight factors, or weighting coefficients, for providing weighted sums to be considered or utilized for data reduction applications, has been limited (by applied arithmetic functions which represent absolute values and squares of values) to the generating of positive values and constant proportions thereof to provide relative or proportionate weighting.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The heretofore art of generating weight factors, or weighting coefficients for application of least-squares techniques has been limited to the generating of positive values to provide relative or proportionate weighting of squared residuals or represented squared deviations.
      <br/>
      Corresponding forms of weighting coefficients (as provided for weighting of squared residuals or represented squared deviations) have been limited to a few known forms which are characterized by representations which include the following:
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      1. positive weight factors representing the squares of uncertainties in dependent variable measurements (ref. W. Press, B. Flannery, S. Teukolsky, W. Vetterling, Numerical Recipes, Cambridge University Press, N.Y., pp. 504-515, 1986);
      <br/>
      2. positive weight factors representing the weights of measurements of a dependent variable (ref. M. Hull, Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology, McGraw-Hill, Vol. 9, pp. 648-649, 1987);
      <br/>
      3. positive factors which establish weighting of squared deviations, including representing squares of perpendicular distances between represented data points and approximating lines as proposed in 1878 by Adcock, referred to by York (ref. D. York, Can. J. Phys., Vol. 44, pp 1079-1086, 1966);
      <br/>
      4. positive weight factors representing the product of components of variable weighting divided by the sum of said components of variable weighting (ref. D. York, ibid.), and generally considered to represent the inverse of a effective variance (ref. B. Reed, Am. J. Phys., Vol. 57, No. 7, pp 642-646, 1989);
      <br/>
      5. positive weight factors representing the inverse of estimated variances or squared deviations as proposed in 1967 by Clutton-Brock (ref. M. Clutton-Brock, Technometrics, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp. 261-269, 1967);
      <br/>
      6. positive weight factors which include estimated uncertainty in providing representations for sums of one dimensional squared deviations representing distances between experimental data points and approximating lines (ref. F. Neri, G. Saitta, and S. Chiofalo, J. Phys. E: Sci. Instrum., Vol. 22, pp. 215-217, 1989);
      <br/>
      7. certain characterized forms of coordinate related coefficients and constant proportions thereof for weighting of squared residuals in correspondence with represented datum coordinates, including positive weight factors comprising precision weight factor coordinate normalizing proportions and positive weight factors comprising transformation weight factor coordinate normalizing proportions (ref. L. Chandler, ibid.).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Six formidable features of the least-squares approach to data reduction are:
      <br/>
      1.
      <br/>
      Nonlinear applications of least-squares techniques are often based upon a false assumption that a minimum value for the sum of squared residuals or represented squared deviations will correspond to an appropriate data representation.
      <br/>
      2. Least-squares techniques do not comprise means to represent the direct weighting of residuals nor to include direct residual-component weighting in the form of either represented variable-related proportions or represented term-related proportions.
      <br/>
      3. Least-squares techniques do not provide means for including representation for the residua of represented sums of parametrically expressed and biased residuals in the formulating of independent equations.
      <br/>
      4. Least-squares techniques do not provide for the inclusion of residual weighting coefficients which are comprised of component normalizing proportions which correspondingly weight individual components of represented multi-dimensional residuals.
      <br/>
      5. Implementing of least-squares techniques with included weighting of squared residuals or represented squared deviations inherently requires and includes identical said weighting in the formulating of each and every independent equation in a represented set of independent equations.
      <br/>
      6. Least-squares techniques do not provide for an optional selecting or a generating of more than a single form of weighting coefficient to be included in the formulating of a single set of independent equations.

      Discriminate reduction data processing as introduced by earlier patent applications of present inventor (ref. L. Chandler, ibid.) provides an advanced form of data processing which is valid for a wide variety of two parameter applications and for multiple-parameter applications which can be represented without error in the included independent variables.
      <br/>
      Implied squared residual weighting is therein represented by including transformation weight factor coordinate normalizing proportions which are generated by a final stage discriminate rectifier which provides positive numerical correspondence to derivatives by means of absolute value rectification.
      <br/>
      Discriminate reduction data processing as implemented for multiple-parameter applications provides for the evaluating of approximating parameters which are generated by means of searching for minimum values for a represented sum of weighted squared deviations.
      <br/>
      This method of evaluating forces representation of evaluated approximating parameters to correspond to encountered minimum values for said represented sum without explicit regard to a true convergent solution to the represented equations.
      <br/>
      Discriminate reduction data processing thus provides inaccurate solutions for certain applications in which the provided weight factors are generated functions of the represented fitting parameters.

    <p num="14">
      Function similation as herein disclosed provides adept equations to be used in conjunction with or as replacement for certain equations which might be determined by alternate reduction techniques.
      <br/>
      Assuming a relationship between a variation and represented variables to be governed by natural laws, and also assuming that said relationship may be expressed in correspondence with an inherent similitude, the spellings, similation and similator, are herein coined to imply correspondence to said inherent similitude, or more specifically, the representing of approximating equations which are generated as herein disclosed to approximately replicate inherent correspondence to said natural laws or in general, to establish at least seemingly appropriate approximating relationships which relate characterized variation to variables in correspondence with provided data.
    </p>
    <p num="15">In accordance with the present invention, an adept equation is an equation that is represented to include at least three sums comprising evaluated addends multiplied by corresponding weighting coefficients, said weighting coefficients being represented and included to implement inverse deviation variation weighting, said equation being included in a system comprising representation of at least three independent equations, said system being configured to represent evaluations of at least three fitting parameters in compliance with said at least three independent equations, said addends being evaluated in correspondence with a value which is represented as including error, said value representing numerical correspondence to at least one independent variable, said at least three independent equations not representing viable form for evaluating approximating parameters which substantially minimize represented sums of weighted squared residuals as represented to include weighting of transformation weight factor coordinate normalizing proportions.</p>
    <p num="16">Any equation so rendered, even as represented by designating or functional components of a processing system for the formulating of a solution of represented said at least three independent equations by a single matrix equation, or alternate viable reduction techniques, is considered to be an adept equation in accordance with the present invention.</p>
    <p num="17">It should be noted in accordance with the present invention that minimizing operations which do not include minimizing with respect to all fitting parameters as included in the weighting coefficients of a represented sum of weighted error-affected addends do not constitute means to generate values for said fitting parameters which substantially minimize said represented sum.</p>
    <p num="18">In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide automated or semi-automated function similation which will formulate candidate and likely equations, and if necessary include representation of estimated residua, in order to establish a set or sets of independent equations as represented by functional components of a data processing system; and to provide corresponding means to activate said functional components of said data processing system thereby representing data for applications which characterize or implement analytic form in correspondence with a represented variation as considered to be a function of at least one variable.</p>
    <p num="19">It is an object of this invention to provide accurate forms of data processing which may be implemented for analysis of either analog or digitally represented data of either represented bivariate or multivariate forms.</p>

    <p num="22">It is another object of this invention to provide means for generating or representing residua of correspondingly weighted residual sums as may be included in the formulating of represented independent equations.</p>
    <p num="23">It is another object of this invention to provide for the generating of weighting coefficients, including coordinated related coefficients, multi-term variable related coefficients, cross term minimizing (CTM) coefficients, and corresponding weighting coefficients which might include representation of effective variance, as may be implemented in providing forms of inverse deviation variation weighting.</p>

    <p num="25">It is another object of this invention to provide means for representing independent equation term functions as sums of products of represented residual term functions similarly multiplied by weighting coefficients to implement resolution of sets of independent equations which represent implied squared residual weighting.</p>
    <p num="26">It is another object of this invention to provide for acquisition of real time data which may include evaluating of independent equation term functions as represented by integral sums which may be provided by analog circuitry.</p>

    <p num="28">
      During phase two, estimates of independent equation term functions are generated in correspondence with provided data.
      <br/>
      Each of the two mentioned phases of function similation, and corresponding phases of data function similation as may be represented, may include operations for generating evaluated independent equation term functions which are represented sums of evaluated correspondingly weighted residual term functions.
      <br/>
      For certain embodiments of the present invention, and including some embodiments which provide real time data acquisition, representation of evaluated independent equation term functions may be generated one time for both of these two phases of operation.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, phase one and phase two of function similation may be combined to include a single evaluating of term functions.
      <br/>
      It is another object of this invention to provide for acquisition of real time data which may include a single evaluating of term functions which are represented by integral sums as may be provided by analog circuitry.
    </p>
    <p num="29">It is a further object of this invention to provide such data processing which accounts for errors that are associated with represented data, even when a provided analytical description includes the representing of multiple error-affected independent-variable terms.</p>

      In accordance with the present invention for each provided form of a represented fitting function there exists a significant number of independent and valid parametric equations, which accurately relate fitting parameters by expressions and alternate forms of expressions which include sums and sums of products of represented residual term functions and coefficients.
      <br/>
      Validity is assumed to be established for represented function related weighting when both the sum of correspondingly weighted residuals and the sum of the absolute value of correspondingly weighted residuals significantly vanish when evaluated utilizing nearly error-free data.
      <br/>
      If both the sum of correspondingly weighted residuals and the sum of absolute value of correspondingly weighted residuals can be assumed to vanish in correspondence with error-free data, then it can also be assumed that correspondingly weighted error-affected residuals can be represented as bivariate or multivariate Taylor series expansions without including representation of correspondingly weighted function related deviations which can be assumed to accordingly vanish for an appropriate analytic representation of the provided data with correspondingly appropriate weighting of residual components as expressed in terms of error-affected variables which include errors that are characterized by non-skewed uncertainty distributions.

      In accordance with the present invention correspondingly weighted representation of simulated or estimated residua (which may include numeric or parametric representation of simulated or estimated residua) may be included as represented terms of independent equations to compensate for errors in provided datum variables.
      <br/>
      The increased number of terms as included in a correspondingly increased number of independent equations, will provide for the optional relative evaluating of all term coefficients, including a relative coefficient for the dependent variable or dependent term function.
      <br/>
      The evaluating of relative values for all coefficients and subsequent normalizing of coefficients on a single coefficient (which is generally the coefficient of a dependent variable) will allow at least proportionate variability in estimated residua as represented by characterized errors.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="45">Reduction Techniques and Related Terminology</p>
    <p num="46">Automated or semi-automated processes whereby at least one adept equation is established, verified, and included in the implementing of at least one set of independent equations in providing form or forms of controlled data reduction to evaluate at least one plurality of parameters which are included in the representing of at least one approximating relationship as characterized by represented variables, are herein referred to by the inventor as function similation.</p>
    <p num="47">
      Automated or semi-automated processes which implement resolution of at least one set of independent equations in order to represent relative or direct correspondence for at least one fitting parameter as included in characterizing represented approximating form for at least one adept equation are referred to herein as adept data processing.
      <br/>
      Data processing systems which implement forms of adept data processing are referred to in accordance with the present invention as adept data processors.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In accordance with this invention, a base equation may be established by equating an expression which parametrically represents the sum of approximating equation residuals (which may be individually weighted by including residual weighting coefficients) to a corresponding estimated (or simulated or parametrically represented) sum, which sum is referred to herein as an estimated base equation residuum.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, an estimated base equation residuum is estimated (or simulated) numerical or parametric correspondence (which may be relative correspondence) for a sum of base residuals, which are correspondingly weighted said approximating equation residuals as evaluated in correspondence with provided, representative, or simulated data.
      <br/>
      The same terminology, estimated residuum, or the plural form, estimated residua, may also refer to estimated subordinate equation residua, which are considered herein to provide approximate relative correspondence to parametrically expressed sums of subordinate residuals as included in represented subordinate equations.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Preferred forms of residual weighting coefficients, as included to provide residual weighting in the formulating of base equations, are intended to provide forms of normalization for which the sum of weighted approximating equation residuals can be assumed to statistically represent a correspondingly weighted sum of Taylor series terms which comprise even ordered partial derivatives of a represented function deviation multiplied by even powers of the error in the corresponding error-affected variables; said Taylor series terms being terms of bivariate or multivariate Taylor series approximations of said function deviation as if evaluated in correspondence with true values of said variables and unknown said error, as subject to the assumption that an ensemble of likely error, which might be related to each represented datum variable, would be correspondingly represented by a non-skewed probability distribution.
      <br/>
      Preferred forms of residual weighting coefficients as herein disclosed include preferred forms of coordinate related coefficients, preferred forms of multi-term variable related coefficients, and preferred forms of multi-term uncertainty-weighting coefficients.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In accordance with the present invention a fitting function is a parametric relationship corresponding to analytic form which relates a considered dependent variable to at least one independent variable.
      <br/>
      The relationship between dependent and independent variables may also be expressed in terms of alternately formulated parametric equations, or in the represented form of an approximative equation which is formulated specifically to relate all included terms and non-zero constants of a parametric fitting function or an alternately represented parametric equation to zero.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, a characterized fitting function or characterized parametric equation is a fitting function or parametric equation which is characterized by determined or estimated unique values for represented fitting parameters.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In accordance with the present invention, an approximative equation is a parametric equation which is expressed to equate represented sums or differences of dependent and independent variable related functions and included constants to zero.
      <br/>
      A characterized approximative equation as expressed to represent estimates or determined values for fitting parameters is referred to herein as An approximating equation.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      In accordance with the present invention, a function deviation may be analytically represented by algebraically transferring all included terms and non-zero constants of an analytically characterized fitting function or characterized parametric equation to a single side of a resultant approximating equation.
      <br/>
      And, in accordance with the present invention, an analytically represented function deviation corresponding to a characterized parametric equation (or characterized fitting function as might be represented) is defined as said single side of said resultant approximating equation as characterized by including estimated or provided values for the represented fitting parameters, and as expressed to represent all included terms and non-zero constants of said characterized parametric equation.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In accordance with the present invention a functions and derivatives need not necessarily be analytically represented. approximative relationships may be of a form that cannot be readily expressed in analytic form, hence related functions and derivatives may be represented by alternate means, such as tables of corresponding numbers or represented operators.
      <br/>
      Represented function deviations, and other represented functional relationships may be established and implemented in correspondence with any provided form for representing related correspondence.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      A function deviation as hypothetically considered to be evaluated using error-free data (that is, data without error) would represent function related deviations, which are deviations of the corresponding approximating equation from a true data representation at points corresponding to said error-free data.
      <br/>
      A function deviation as evaluated in correspondence with an error-affected datum is herein referred to as an approximating equation residual, said error-affected datum being a considered data point as represented by measures of a plurality of variables, said measures including error-affected measurement of at least one of said variables.
      <br/>
      An approximating equation residual represents both the function related deviation of the approximating equation (as including values for fitting parameters) and the deviation which is caused by errors in the represented datum variables.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Fitting parameters are parameters which may be approximately or accurately represented by relative or direct numerical or alternate correspondence (as estimated, evaluated, or provided) to characterize approximating relationships in correspondence with represented information and reduction restraints.
      <br/>
      Evaluated fitting parameters, estimated fitting parameters, and fitting parameters that are determined by, or are assumed to be determined in correspondence with, or in order to satisfy, imposed reduction restraints, are referred to herein as approximating parameters.
      <br/>
      Approximating parameters may be alternately expressed by any form of determinate representation (e.g. Known values for approximating parameters may be expressed by represented correspondence, or relative measure which may be directly interpreted or evaluated; unknown values for approximating parameters may be represented by estimates or successive approximations, or determinate sets of independent equations).
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, approximating parameters are considered to be determined parameters, and will be held constant during minimizing and maximizing operations (e.g. such as might be related to maximum likelihood estimation).
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Fitting parameters that have not yet been subjected to reduction restraints, are herein referred to as approximative parameters.
      <br/>
      Approximative parameters may be considered as variable during minimizing or maximizing operations.
    </p>
    <p num="57">In accordance with the present invention, function deviations, fitting functions, residuals (including base residuals, subordinate residuals and approximating equation residuals), and residual sums are parametrically represented (or expressed in parametric form) by representing approximative parameters in place of approximating parameters (i.e. by representing fitting parameters which are not yet subjected to reduction restraints in place of included constants or determined parameters).</p>
    <p num="58">
      In accordance with this invention, for equations which are formulated so as to include weighting of residuals, the terminology "correspondingly weighted residuals" refers to corresponding residuals multiplied by corresponding weighting coefficients.
      <br/>
      For equations which are formulated without including weighted residuals, the same terminology, "correspondingly weighted residuals", refers to corresponding residuals without included weighting.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the terminology "correspondingly weighted sum" herein applies to sums comprising either weighted or non-weighted addends which are either weighted in correspondence with at least one set of proportionate weighting coefficients, or are not weighted at all.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Automated or semi-automated processes which generate representation for estimated residua as corresponding to the sum of base or subordinate residuals (as formulated with or without included weighting) are herein referred to as equation residuum estimation or select equation residuum estimation as applied to select equations.
      <br/>
      Alternate forms of equation residuum estimation include simulated residual sum evaluation, Taylor series residuum expansion evaluation, and parametrically expressed residuum formulation.
      <br/>
      The process of simulated residual sum evaluation includes the effectuating of steps whereby represented addends or correspondingly weighted residuals (or whereby included terms or term functions of represented addends or correspondingly weighted residual) are evaluated in correspondence with (or in relative correspondence with) representative or simulated data and summed in order to provide estimation (or proportionate estimation) for select equation residua in correspondence with represented fitting parameters.
      <br/>
      The terminology "select equation residuum" and the plural form "select equation residua" is herein applied to refer to estimated base equation residua, or estimated subordinate equation residua, as may be represented in the formulating of select equations.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Taylor series residuum expansion evaluation involves evaluating representation of corresponding proportion to the sum of correspondingly weighted non-vanishing or assumed more predominate term contributions of bivariate or multivariate expansions (which generally may be represented as Taylor series expansions) of a represented function deviation as evaluated in correspondence with simulated or represented data and simulated error in order to establish numerical correspondence or proportionate numerical correspondence for an estimated select or summed residual equation residuum.
      <br/>
      Alternate forms for representing residua may certainly be established by including constant factors, or by dividing represented predominate or included terms of Taylor series expansions by divisors such as represented fitting parameters or estimated sums of represented even powers of related error.
      <br/>
      Simulated error may be represented by a single value or a multiplicity of values which are representative or proportionately representative of estimated error, simulated error, represented uncertainty, or characterized error distributions.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, uncertainty may be represented by root mean squared values, mean absolute values, or other alternately representative error value estimates including estimates for mean value of represented error raised to an exponential power.
    </p>
    <p num="61">Parametrically expressed residuum formulation involves establishing parametric representation of residua in the formulating of independent equations as represented by functional components of a data processing system.</p>
    <p num="62">
      A term function is the variable portion of a single term as represented without included parametric or numeric coefficient.
      <br/>
      A single term may include a single function, or a plurality of functions multiplied by a single coefficient or the resolute.
      <br/>
      A single term is separated, or isolated and thereby distinguished, from other terms on a single side of an expression or equation by represented addition or subtraction, as may be included or implied by or in said expression or said equation.
      <br/>
      An isolated term function is a term function which can be represented by or included in an isolated (or single) term (multiplied by a same coefficient or resolute) of an expression or equation.
      <br/>
      Term functions as considered herein include:
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      1. term functions (of represented equations, fitting functions, and function deviations) which are represented as variables or as variable functions;
      <br/>

      Viable operations as required for solving sets of transcendental equations must also be appropriately implemented.

      In accordance with the present invention, inverse deviation variation weighting as represented by coordinate related coefficients must be treated as fitting parameter independent during minimizing operations, hence, for applications in which coordinate related coefficients are represented as functions of fitting parameters, searching for minimum values for represented sums of squared residuals does not constitute viable operations for channeling convergence to an appropriate solution.
      <br/>
      Alternately, viable operations for channeling convergence to solutions for equations which are transcendental may be implemented by methods of extrapolation and methods of representing successive approximations.

      In accordance with the present invention, cross term minimizing (CTM) weighting coefficients are weighting coefficients that are included as coefficients of squared deviations in order to diminish sums of odd power error cross products that are inherently included in representing explicit form for the sum of unweighted squared deviations.
      <br/>
      Appropriate form for CTM weighting coefficients can sometimes be established by:
      <br/>
      1. utilizing a Taylor series expansion to approximately represent the evaluated approximation deviations in terms of partial derivatives and represented error;
      <br/>
      2. isolating terms which include odd powers of represented error; and
      <br/>
      3. formulating weighting coefficients as coefficients which can be assumed to diminish the sums of said terms which include odd powers of represented error.
    </p>
    <p num="191">A first order Taylor series expansion of the evaluated approximation deviation, .nu., as evaluated in correspondence with a provided datum, x1, . . . , xN and expanded around assumed appropriate fundamental variables, X1, . . . , XN, may be expressed by Equation 58.  (Equation image '57' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="192">Assuming that (x1, . . . xN).apprxeq.(X1 + DELTA x1, . . . XN + DELTA xN), and that .nu.(X1, . . . XN) can be considered to vanish, then (for small error) Equation 57 can be written in the approximate form which is expressed by Equation 59.  (Equation image '58' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="193">
      By assuming homogeneous precision and by including the appropriate CTM weighting coefficients,  OMEGA k, the explicit form for the sum of the squares of evaluated approximation deviations can sometimes be expressed to diminish the odd power error cross terms.
      <br/>
      For two dimensional applications the expression will reduce to the form that is represented by Equation 60.  (Equation image '59' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="194">
      For a large number of data points with non-skewed error distributions, the sum of the odd power error cross terms can be assumed to vanish provided the included coefficients of said odd power error cross terms can be considered to be constant.
      <br/>
      A first order approximation for bivariate CTM weighting coefficients that will render said coefficients as constant is expressed by Equations 61,  (Equation image '60' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="195">
      wherein the included C may represent any arbitrary constant.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention CTM weighting coefficients as expressed by Equations 61 represent a bivariate form of inverse deviation variation weighting.
      <br/>
      Corresponding precision normalized forms for said bivariate CTM weight factors,  OMEGA , may be expressed by including CTM precision weighting,  OMEGA , as the inverse of a composite product comprising coordinate related components of precision uncertainty, Ux.  (Equation image '61' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="196">
      than two degrees of freedom also require that the sums of all odd power error cross terms of Equation 59 should be diminished.
      <br/>
      Approaches for CTM weighting coefficients which may be provided for more generating multi-variate CTM weighting coefficients may require considering and including uncertainty representations, comparatively selecting single cross term coefficients, or including only selective data samples.
      <br/>
      It may be convenient for some applications to represent two-variable CTM weighting coefficients as might be represented by assuming a form of two-variable inverse deviation variation weighting,  (Equation image '62' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="197">
      by assuming error in only two represented independent variables, as for example might be represented by Equations 61 for multi-variate applications with considered errors only in the measured variables x1 and x2.
      <br/>
      Corresponding two-variable CTM weighting coefficients may be represented by Equations 63,  (Equation image '63' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="198">or alternately written to include precision normalization as exemplified by Equations 64.  (Equation image '64' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="199">
      The two-variable CTM weighting coefficient as represented by Equations 63 or Equations 64 should compensate for uncertainty as restricted to the variables x1k and x2k, in correspondence with the represented deviations.
      <br/>
      It will not provide for proportionate weighting of even power error cross terms, and it may not appropriately weight the functional variations of the deviations for more than two degrees of freedom.
      <br/>
      Generally the increased number of represented odd power error cross product terms will inhibit adequate formulation of CTM weighting coefficients for more than two dimensions.
      <br/>
      Higher order estimates of CTM weighting coefficients are similarly inhibited.
      <br/>
      Alternately, inverse deviation variation weighting may be represented for any number of included variables as might be represented in Equation 18, with the exception that coordinate related coefficients as implemented to represent inverse deviation variation weighting are not represented as the inverse of an evaluated derivative of a function deviation which is raise to a power of two.

    <p num="200">Characteristic Form Iterations</p>
    <p num="201">
      A third problem to be considered in providing nonlinear forms of data reductions is related to higher order nonlinear distortions.
      <br/>
      Assuming the error distribution of the provided data can be appropriately represented, then the accuracy of a corresponding data reduction may be subsequently improved by implementing characteristic form iterations.
      <br/>
      Characteristic form iterations are implemented only after the initial estimates for the unknown parameters have been generated by the data processing system.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, characteristic form iterations will include the following steps:
      <br/>
      1. storing initial estimates to provide both initial estimates and current approximations;
      <br/>
      2. utilizing the represented current approximations to generate successive data simulations as characterized by the represented fitting function and a represented error distribution of assumed characteristic form;
      <br/>
      3. storing the current approximations to represent stored values for previous approximations;
      <br/>
      4. generating simulated estimates by processing said successive data simulations utilizing the same processing techniques that were implemented in generating the initial estimates;
      <br/>
      5. computing new values for the current approximations as represented by the original initial estimates minus the simulated estimates plus the stored values for the previous approximations;
      <br/>
      6. checking convergence by comparing the current approximations to said stored values for previous approximations; and
      <br/>
      7. repeating steps 2 through 6 until a convergence criteria is satisfied.
    </p>
    <p num="202">For compatible reduction techniques, assuming that an appropriate fitting function has been selected and that error distributions have been accurately represented, the convergent values for current approximations as generated by characteristic form iterations may be represented as valid estimates for approximating parameters.</p>
    <p num="203">Nested Parameter Evaluating</p>
    <p num="204">
      A forth problem to be considered in providing nonlinear forms of data reductions is that of nested parameter evaluating.
      <br/>
      Fitting parameters may be represented as coefficients, or they may be imbedded or "nested" within represented term functions.
      <br/>
      Evaluating of fitting parameters that are included as an integral part of term functions may entail representing entire sets of independent equations along with any included base and subordinate residua, in highly sophisticated reduction processes; or alternatively, in accordance with the present invention, successive approximations of fitting parameters and corresponding formulation of represented residual sums may implement representation of increasingly accurate successive estimates of fitting parameters as characterized by parametric equations which include first order Taylor series representations of said residual sums which are expressed in terms of parametric estimates of differences between said successive approximations and said successive estimates.
      <br/>
      At least for simple applications convergence to a solution corresponding to initially provided estimates will generally occur within a few iterations.
      <br/>
      Some caution should be taken, as represented multiple-term equations comprising non-orthogonal term functions may characterize more than one solution set of fitting parameters.
