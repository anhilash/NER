      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to wave energy converters and more particularly pertains to a new wave-actuated electricity generating device for capturing the natural energy of waves of water for the production of electricity.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The use of wave energy converters is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      More specifically, wave energy converters heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Known prior art includes U.S. Pat. No. 4,291,234; U.S. Pat. No. 5,052,902; U.S. Pat. No. 4,625,124; U.S. Pat. No. 4,672,222; U.S. Pat. No. 3,696,251; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,568,836.</p>
    <p num="6">
      While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not disclose a new wave-actuated electricity generating device.
      <br/>
      The inventive device includes a base with upper and lower sides and front and back sides.
      <br/>
      A gate is adapted to move in response to waves exerting pressure against it.
      <br/>
      The gate has front and back surfaces, top and bottom ends, and a pair of lateral sides extending between the top and bottom ends.
      <br/>
      The bottom end of the gate is pivotally coupled to the base.
      <br/>
      The gate pivots in first and second directions with the movement of the waves.
      <br/>
      A pushrod has proximal and distal ends and a longitudinal axis extending therebetween.
      <br/>
      The proximal end of the pushrod is pivotally coupled to the gate.
      <br/>
      The distal end of the pushrod is adapted for coupling to an electrical power generator.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In these respects, the wave-actuated electricity generating device according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of capturing the natural energy of waves of water for the production of electricity.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of wave energy converters now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new wave-actuated electricity generating device construction wherein the same can be utilized for capturing the natural energy of waves of water for the production of electricity.</p>
    <p num="9">The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new wave-actuated electricity generating device apparatus and method which has many of the advantages of the wave energy converters mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new wave-actuated electricity generating device which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art wave energy converters, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="10">
      To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a base with upper and lower sides and front and back sides.
      <br/>
      A gate is adapted to move in response to waves exerting pressure against it.
      <br/>
      The gate has front and back surfaces, top and bottom ends, and a pair of lateral sides extending between the top and bottom ends.
      <br/>
      The bottom end of the gate is pivotally coupled to the base.
      <br/>
      The gate pivots in first and second directions with the movement of the waves.
      <br/>
      A pushrod has proximal and distal ends and a longitudinal axis extending therebetween.
      <br/>
      The proximal end of the pushrod is pivotally coupled to the gate.
      <br/>
      The distal end of the pushrod is adapted for coupling to an electrical power generator.

    <p num="11">
      There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.
      <br/>
      There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.
      <br/>
      The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways.
      <br/>
      Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention.
      <br/>
      It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Further, the purpose of the foregoing abstract is to enable the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the public generally, and especially the scientists, engineers and practitioners in the art who are not familiar with patent or legal terms or phraseology, to determine quickly from a cursory inspection the nature and essence of the technical disclosure of the application.
      <br/>
      The abstract is neither intended to define the invention of the application, which is measured by the claims, nor is it intended to be limiting as to the scope of the invention in any way.
    </p>
    <p num="15">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new wave-actuated electricity generating device apparatus and method which has many of the advantages of the wave energy converters mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new wave-actuated electricity generating device which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art wave energy converters, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="16">It is another object of the present invention to provide a new wave-actuated electricity generating device which may be easily and efficiently manufactured and marketed.</p>
    <p num="17">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new wave-actuated electricity generating device which is of a durable and reliable construction.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="26">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIGS. 1 through 4 thereof, a new wave-actuated electricity generating device embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described.</p>
    <p num="27">
      As best illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 4, the wave-actuated electricity generating device 10 generally comprises a base 20 with upper and lower sides 21,22 and front and back sides 23,24.
      <br/>
      A gate is adapted to move in response to waves exerting pressure against it.
      <br/>
      The gate 30 has front and back surfaces 31,32, top and bottom ends 33,34, and a pair of lateral sides 35 extending between the top and bottom ends 33,34.
      <br/>
      The bottom end 34 of the gate 30 is pivotally coupled to the base 20.
      <br/>
      The gate 30 pivots in first and second directions with the movement of the waves.
      <br/>
      A pushrod 40 has proximal and distal ends 41,42 and a longitudinal axis extending therebetween.
      <br/>
      The proximal end 41 of the pushrod 40 is pivotally coupled to the gate 30.
      <br/>
      The distal end 42 of the pushrod 40 is adapted for coupling to an electrical power generator 50.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Preferably, the upper side 21 of the base 20 has a generally horizontal first portion 25 that is positioned towards the front side 23 of the base 20, a generally horizontal second portion 26 positioned towards the back side 24 of the base 20, and an angled portion 27 that extends between the first and second portions 25,26 of the upper side 21 of the base 20 such that an obtuse angle is formed between the first portion 25 of the upper side 21 of the base 20 and the angled portion 27.
      <br/>
      The angle is ideally about 135 degrees.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Also preferably, the front and back sides 23,24 of the base 20 taper towards each other from the lower side 22 of the base 20 towards the upper side 21 of the base 20 to help keep the base 20 anchored in the ground if partially buried, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The tapering also pushes the portion of a wave striking the front side 23 of the base 20 upwardly towards the gate 30.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The gate 30 pivots in first and second directions.
      <br/>
      The first direction is towards the angled portion 27 of the base 20.
      <br/>
      The second direction is away from the angled portion 27 of the base 20.
      <br/>
      The angled portion 27 of the base 20 limits the movement of the gate 30 in the first direction by providing a surface against which the back surface 32 of the gate 30 abuts.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the gate 30 has a concave portion 36 positioned towards its top end 33 that curves towards its front surface 31 to reduce loss of wave energy cause by water splashing over the top end 33 of the gate 30 instead of pushing on it.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Preferably, an electrical power generator 50 operatively connected to the device 10.
      <br/>
      The electrical power generator 50 has a flywheel 51 operatively coupled to it.
      <br/>
      The electrical power generator 50 produces electricity when the flywheel 51 is rotated.
      <br/>
      The flywheel 51 has a mechanical linkage 52 coupled to it.
      <br/>
      The mechanical linkage 52 translates reciprocating motion into rotational motion for rotating the flywheel 51.
      <br/>
      The distal end 42 of the pushrod 40 is operatively coupled to the mechanical linkage 52.
      <br/>
      Thus, as the gate 30 moves back and forth in the first and second directions, the flywheel 51 is turned.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Also preferably, the base 20 has a frusto-conical bore 55 that extends through the angled portion 27 of the base 20 towards the back side 24 of the base 20.
      <br/>
      The bore 55 tapers together from the angled portion 27 of the base 20 towards the back side 24 of the base 20.
      <br/>
      A telescoping return arm 56 biases the gate 30 in the second direction.
      <br/>
      The return arm 56 has primary and secondary ends 57,58 and a longitudinal axis extending between its primary and secondary ends 57,58.
      <br/>
      The primary end 57 of the return arm 56 is disposed in the bore 55 of the base 20 and coupled to the inside of the bore 55 towards the back side 24 of the base 20.
      <br/>
      The secondary end 58 of the return arm 56 is pivotally coupled to the back surface 32 of the gate 30.
      <br/>
      In operation, the return arm 56 telescopically retracts as the gate 30 moves in the first direction.
      <br/>
      The return arm 56 telescopically extends as the gate 30 moves in the second direction.
      <br/>
      The return arm 56 is biased towards the second direction to return the gate 30 to a position where it will again be pushed in the first direction by a wave.
      <br/>
      A spring may be disposed in the return arm 56 to bias it towards an extended position.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A ramp 60 extends along a bottom of a body of water at an acute angle from a horizontal plane.
      <br/>
      The ramp 60 has front and back ends 61,62 and a top surface 63 that extends between the front and back ends 61,62.
      <br/>
      The base 20 is positionable along the ramp 60 between the front and back ends 61,62 of the ramp 60 to adjust the position of the gate 30 with respect to the height of the waves and/or the surface level of the water.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the front end 61 of the ramp 60 has an abutment lip 72 extending upwardly therefrom for limiting the movement of the base 20 towards the front end 61 of the ramp 60.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Preferably, the ramp 60 has a threaded shaft 64 that rotatably extends between the front and back ends 61,62 of the ramp 60 and is spaced apart from the top surface 63 of the ramp 60.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the threaded shaft 64 is coupled to a motor 65.
      <br/>
      Also ideally, a float switch 66 extends from the back side 24 of the base 20.
      <br/>
      The float switch 66 comprises a buoyant portion 68 coupled to an arm 67 that extends from a switch (not shown).
      <br/>
      If the arm 67 goes above a certain angle, the motor 65 turns the threaded shaft 64 to move the base 20 towards the back end 62.
      <br/>
      If the arm 67 goes below a certain angle, the motor 65 turns the threaded shaft 64 to move the base 20 towards the front end 61.
      <br/>
      In this way, the gate 30 is adjusted for maximum effectiveness, even with the varying water levels cause by the tides.
      <br/>
      Placement of the float switch 66 on the back side 24 of the base 20 is preferred because the surface of the water behind the base 20 is not as choppy, as the gate 30 and base 20 have broken the wave.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Also most ideally, the motor 65 is in communication with a battery 69 and a solar panel 70 by a wiring system.
      <br/>
      The solar panel 70 recharges the battery 69.
      <br/>
      The battery 69 may also be recharged by the electricity produced by the electrical power generator 50.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Also preferably, the lower side 22 of the base 20 has a channel 28 extending into it and that extends through the front and back sides 23,24 of the base 20.
      <br/>
      The channel 28 has a drive flange (not shown) extending downwardly from it.
      <br/>
      The drive flange has a threaded aperture through it.
      <br/>
      The threaded shaft 64 is threadedly inserted in the threaded aperture of the drive flange of the base 20 such that rotation of the threaded shaft 64 in one direction moves the base 20 along the ramp 60 towards the front end 61 of the ramp 60 and rotation of the threaded shaft 64 in another direction moving the base 20 along the ramp 60 towards the back end 62 of the ramp 60.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Preferably, the pushrod 40 is telescopically extendible along the longitudinal axis thereof.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, the pushrod 40 comprises an outer sleeve 43 and an inner sleeve 45 that is telescopically received in the outer sleeve 43.
      <br/>
      The outer sleeve 43 has a pair of opposed apertures 44 extending through it.
      <br/>
      The inner sleeve 45 has a plurality of sets of opposed holes 46 extending through it.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      A pin 74 is insertable though the apertures 44 of the outer sleeve 43 and a set of holes 46 of the inner sleeve 45 aligned with the apertures 44 of the outer sleeve 43 to help prevent sliding of the inner sleeve 45 with respect to the outer sleeve 43.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the pin 74 has a head portion 76 and a shaft portion 75.
      <br/>
      The head portion 76 has an outer diameter greater than the shaft portion 75.
      <br/>
      The pin 74 has a pull ring extending from the head portion 76.
      <br/>
      A tip of the shaft portion 75 of the pin 74 has retractable bearing keepers 77 extending from it.
      <br/>
      The retractable bearing keepers 77 are biased outwardly of the pin 74 to abut the outer shaft so that the pin 74 does not become disengaged from the holes 46 and apertures 44 of the of the inner and outer sleeves 45,43.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Preferably, the lower side 22 of the base 20 has a plurality of wheels 29 coupled thereto that are positioned adjacent the channel 28.
      <br/>
      The wheels 29 rotatably engage the upper surface of the ramp 60 so that the base 20 moves more easily along the ramp 60 with less wear to the ramp 60.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Also preferably, the top surface 63 of the ramp 60 has a pair of spaced apart elongate 30 guide ridges 71 extending along it between the front and back ends 61,62 of the ramp 60.
      <br/>
      The guide ridges 71 are positioned on opposite sides of the threaded shaft 64.
      <br/>
      Ideally, each of the guide ridges 71 has a generally rectangular transverse cross section taken perpendicular to a longitudinal axis thereof.
      <br/>
      The guide ridges 71 of the ramp 60 slidably engage opposite walls of the channel 28 of the base 20.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In use, the base 20 is placed in a body of water with the gate 30 facing the incoming waves.
      <br/>
      As the waves hit the gate 30, the gate 30 is pushed in the first direction, thereby pushing on the pushrod 40 and turning the flywheel 51 of the generator 50 so that the generator 50 produces electricity.
      <br/>
      After a wave pushes the gate 30 back, the return arm 56 pushes the gate 30 in the second direction to put it in position for receiving another wave crash.
    </p>
    <p num="42">If the threaded shaft 64 is used, the position of the base 20 may be varied with respect to the height of the waves and/or the surface level of the water to maximize efficiency of the gate 30 in the surf.</p>
    <p num="43">
      As to a further discussion of the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="44">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
    <p num="45">
      Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention.
      <br/>
      Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.
