    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to high strength polymeric networks derived from (meth)acrylate resins with moderate to high organofluorine contents and processes for making same.
      <br/>
      In particular, these resins are useful for dental composites.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      In dentistry, fluoropolymers have been widely utilized as components of medical devices because of the advantageous blend of chemical inertness with generally good biocompatibility.
      <br/>
      As the demand for advanced fluoropolymers with specific physical properties has grown, the molecular design of new types of fluorinated monomers has become an important area in synthetic polymer chemistry.
      <br/>
      Several properties of fluoropolymers, including their chemical inertness, hydrophobicity and toughness, make fluoropolymers interesting candidates for use in dental composites.
      <br/>
      However, due to low cohesive energies, amorphous fluorinated polymers tend to have unacceptably low mechanical strength.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In the area of aesthetic dental composite materials used for restorative and cosmetic purposes, the critical advancement in polymer technology was the introduction of 2,2-bis�p-(2'-hydroxy-3'-methacrylpropoxy)phenyl�propane, commonly referred to as Bis-GMA.
      <br/>
      This bulky dimethacrylate monomer is used with a low viscosity diluent comonomer, typically triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), to prepare resins that form strong, densely cross-linked polymeric networks.
      <br/>
      More than 30 years after their introduction, resins based on varying proportions of Bis-GMA/TEGDMA still constitute the majority of commercial dental composite filling materials.
      <br/>
      Among other methacrylates utilized in commercial composite restoratives are urethane-containing monomers, such as urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA), and oligomers, such as the linear poly(urethane) prepared from Bis-GMA and hexamethylene diisocyanate (Bis-GMA-HMDI).
      <br/>
      Additional components of dental composites include a particulate filler, generally a barium, strontium or zirconium-containing glass and/or a microfine silica, whose surface is modified by attachment of a layer of a methacrylate-functionalized silane coupling agent, 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane.
      <br/>
      A visible light activated photoinitiator system, camphorquinone (CQ) and an amine photoreductant, such as ethyl 4-N,N-dimethylaminobenzoate (EDMAB), allows the onset of polymerization to be controlled and then the rapid development of the cross-linked resin matrix to yield the cured composite under ambient conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The relatively high modulus fillers used in dental composites serve to increase the strength, wear resistance and toughness of the resin matrix by reinforcement.
      <br/>
      The silane coupling agent plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of the reinforcing effect of the filler.
      <br/>
      Addition of substantial amounts of filler also minimizes the overall polymerization shrinkage associated with the continuous matrix phase.
      <br/>
      The particulate filler is also responsible for the translucence of the cured composite that gives it the natural tooth-like appearance.
      <br/>
      Coloration incorporated during the preparation of the filler can reproduce a broad spectrum of natural tooth shades and this allows near perfect matching of the composite to the adjacent tooth structure.
      <br/>
      The small particle size of the fillers used in the dental composites means that the composites can be polished to produce an excellent texture match with natural tooth.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Typical conventional resins based on Bis-GMA and TEGDMA ranging from mass ratios of 50:50 to 80:20, depending on the particular dental application, provide strong polymers.
      <br/>
      The cross-linked polymers are glasses whose degree of conversion of the available methacrylate groups is restricted by vitrification as the glass transition temperature of the developing polymer reaches the cure temperature.
      <br/>
      The degree of conversion attained during ambient temperature photopolymerzation is generally in the range 60% to 70%.
      <br/>
      The conversion varies somewhat with the intensity of the curing light; a more intense irradiation results in a faster polymerization with a greater exotherm.
      <br/>
      The fully cured resin is characterized as a highly cross-linked three dimensional polymeric network with many pendant methacrylate-terminated chains that lack sufficient mobility for further reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Polymers designed to permanently replace tissues in the human body lost to disease, trauma or simple deterioration must satisfy a number of criteria.
      <br/>
      Beyond the obvious requirement of biocompatibility, long-tem stability dictates the need for materials that are highly resistant to alteration or degradation upon exposure to aqueous environments and resistant to a variety of chemical substances.
      <br/>
      In materials under consideration for dental composite restorative applications, the need for inert polymer matrices is coupled with the need for polymers that have adequate mechanical properties to minimize wear and fracture in both load-bearing and non-loadbearing situations.
      <br/>
      With an essentially limitless range of potential monomeric components available, advanced polymeric materials can be tailored to meet specific challenges such as these.
      <br/>
      Because of the excellent resistance displayed by fluoropolymers used in aqueous or other aggressive chemical environments, a variety of partially fluorinated monomers have been investigated previously as a means to achieve hydrophobic, chemically stable dental polymers.
      <br/>
      However, the use of significant proportions of fluorinated mono- or di-methacrylate monomers in dental resins typically produces polymers with unacceptably low mechanical strength properties primarily due to the low cohesive energies of amorphous fluorinated polymers.

    <p num="16">
      The introduction of covalently bound organofluorine into dental resins offers a technique to dramatically reduce water uptake, eliminate discoloration and improve the fracture toughness of composites.
      <br/>
      Through appropriate design of the fluoromonomers, materials achieving both low polymerization shrinkage and excellent mechanical strength are attained.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The initial objective of this investigation which resulted in the present invention was the development of practical synthetic routes to a variety of methacrylate monomers and reactive oligomers with moderate to high organofluorine contents.
      <br/>
      Photopolymerizable dental resins that combine the desirable properties of hydrophobicity, good mechanical strength and low polymerization shrinkage are sought for dental restorative applications.
      <br/>
      The oral environment provides significant challenges for the survival of polymeric materials.
      <br/>
      Dental restoratives experience continuous exposure to moisture, cyclic stresses and contact with a broad range of chemicals introduced through food and drink.
      <br/>
      It is predicted that resins based on these new fluorinated monomers will produce more inert, stain-resistant dental composite materials with improved long-term durability compared with existing hydrocarbon based resins.
      <br/>
      To aid in the selection of candidate fluorinated materials with potential for use in dental composites, the refractive index, water contact angle, water sorption, flexural strength and polymerization shrinkage of the photo-cured fluorinated resins and their composites were evaluated.
      <br/>
      Although not measured here, improvements in the fracture toughness of dental composites might also be expected for materials based on certain fluorinated resins.
      <br/>
      Due to the combination of low refractive indices, dielectric constants and surface free energies associated with polymers with moderate to high organofluorine contents, the readily polymerizable fluorinated monomers and oligomers developed here also could be considered for a variety of nonbiomaterial applications including structural and optical adhesives, chemically resistant coatings, fiber optics, electronics and integrated circuits.

      <br/>
      The high strength properties available from the polymers of these monomers and prepolymers are related to structural details incorporated in the monomers and prepolymers which include: details to increase the crosslink density in polymers, rigid backbones to enhance stiffness, and hydrogen bonding via urethane (or other) linkages to reinforce the polymeric network.

    <p num="88">Comparative Example</p>
    <p num="89">
      This comparative example involves a control resin of Bis-GMA and TEGDMA dimethacrylate monomers because dental resins and composites based on the combination of Bis-GMA and TEGDMA dimethacrylate monomers are widely used.
      <br/>
      Typical properties of unfilled photocured resins comprised of Bis-GMA/TEGDMA (7:3 mass ratio) include a polymerization shrinkage of 7.9% by volume, a diametral tensile strength (DTS) and flexural strength (FS) of 42.2 MPa +- 3.6 MPa and 75.3 MPa +- 4.3 MPa, respectively.
      <br/>
      A particulate glass-filled composite based on the Bis-GMA/TEGDMA resin(mass fraction of 80% filler) produced DTS and FS values of 50.5 MPa +- 1.3 MPa and 91.4 MPa +- 8.5 MPa, respectively.

    <p num="90">A. Syntheses of Monomers of the Present Invention</p>
    <p num="91">
      As shown in Scheme 1, a number of interrelated synthetic routes (paths A-D) to fluorinated monomers and oligomers were examined.
      <br/>
      All of these techniques rely on the facile epoxide ring-opening addition reaction with either methacrylic acid or relatively acidic fluorinated alcohols.
      <br/>
      While similar in this general theme, the multifunctional oligomeric monomers produced differ substantially in overall structure, organofluorine content and the types of polymerizable groups they contain.
      <br/>
      The synthetic approaches used in the present invention leave the methacrylate ester groups far removed from the strong electron withdrawing effects of the fluorinated substituents.
      <br/>
      The insulation of the ester groups from the fluorinated substituents should promote acceptable levels of hydrolytic stability in these methacrylate esters that can not be achieved by direct esterification of the majority of available fluorinated alcohol or diol starting materials.
      <br/>
      The avoidance of potential hydrolytic stability problems for the polymer matrix is a serious consideration for materials designed for long-term durability in the oral environment.
      <br/>
      Scheme 1 is shown as Parts 1, 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      The parts are all connected.  (Chemical Structure image '25' not included in text)

    <p num="92">
      For the most part, diepoxides were used as starting materials for the synthesis of the fluorinated methacrylates.
      <br/>
      The reactive multifunctional oligomeric approach was adopted in most cases because it offers increased cross-link densities compared with simpler dimethacrylated monomers at comparable levels of conversion.
      <br/>
      The use of multifunctional ooigomers also minimizes the presence of pendant chains that remain in the polymerized network structures.
      <br/>
      Typically, the ambient temperature photopolymerization of dimethacrylate dental resins produces vitrified polymers with cross-link efficiencies of only about 20%.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the majority of the difunctional monomer units are incorporated into polymer as half-reacted pendant methacrylate terminated chains.
      <br/>
      This aspect may be especially important in the development of fluorinated polymers with good mechanical strength properties.
      <br/>
      Due to the low cohesive energy associated with fluorinated polymers, excessive amounts of pendant chains may be very detrimental to the glass transition temperature, modulus and strength properties attainable with these resin systems.
      <br/>
      A recent evaluation of a series of fluorinated dimethacrylate monomers, which varied in fluorine mass fraction from 23% to 61%, demonstrated that strength properties of the resulting photocured polymers generally decreased with increasing fluorine content and that all the strength values obtained for the fluorinated materials, even those with relatively modest fluorine contents, were significantly less that those of the Bis-GMA/TEGDMA hydrocarbon control material.
      <br/>
      The oligomeric fluorinated monomers are expected to reduce or eliminate this disparity in strength and thereby allow the incorporation of higher levels of fluorine without the sacrifice of mechanical strength.
      <br/>
      Finally, the use of relatively high molecular weight oligomers in the resins tends to minimize potential toxicity concerns for materials under consideration for intra-oral application.

      <br/>
      After the photocuring, the composite samples were ejected from the molds and polished on silicon carbide abrasive paper (400 grit) using a HANDIMET GRINDER (Buehler Ltd.
      <br/>
      Evanston, Ill.) to get both flat surfaces and smooth edges.
      <br/>
      Photocured composites were then immersed in distilled water and placed in an oven at 37 (degree)  C. for 2 days to allow the post-cure polymerization process to proceed prior to testing.

      The evaluation of the fluorinated monomers and oligomers for use in dental resin applications required the addition of an appropriate amount of a diluent comonomer to each to control the overall viscosity of the resulting resins.
      <br/>
      The reactive diluent comonomer used was 1,10-decamethylene glycol dimethacrylate (DMDM), which offers good compatibility with a wide range of hydrophobic fluorinated monomers, whereas the more hydrophilic monomer TEGDMA was prone to phase separation in fluorinated resins either before or during polymerization.
      <br/>
      After omitting the resin based on the bromine-containing oligomer 3b, there is a clear trend (squared* linear regression correlation coefficient r2 =0.82) among the remaining fluorinated oligomers to require less diluent comonomer in resin formulation as the percentage of fluorine increases.
      <br/>
      The amount of diluent necessary to provide a workable resin viscosity is important since it influences the overall percentage of fluorine in the individual resins (Table 1).
      <br/>
      In general, minimum amounts of diluent are also preferred since relatively low molecular weight monomers contribute significant polymerization shrinkage.
      <br/>
      The two fluorinated monomers 12 and 13 require significantly less diluent than the fluorinated oligomers of comparable fluorine content.
      <br/>
      To complete the resin formulation, a visible light photoinitiator system consisting of camphorquinone (CQ) and ethyl 4-N,N-dimethylaminobenzoate (EDMAB) was added to each resin.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      The refractive indices of both the monomers and their corresponding resins show a negative correlation with the fluorine content of the monomer and resin, respectively (r2 =0.83 and r2 =0.63, Table 1).
      <br/>
      The fluorinated resins range in refractive index from approximately 1.41 to 1.48. For comparison, a conventional dental resin, such as Bis-GMA/TEGDMA (7:3 mass ratio), has a refractive index of 1.5218 (22.5 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The bromine-containing oligomer 3b was included here to study the practicality of higher refractive index fluorinated resins that may allow more choice in the selection of fillers to be incorporated into fluorinated composite formulations.
      <br/>
      In general, it is desirable to have a relatively good match between the refractive index of the resin and filler to allow good light transmission for photopolymerization and to achieve a translucent polymeric composite that has an appearance similar to natural tooth structure.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      The degree of conversion of thin films of the photocured unfilled fluorinated resins was determined by measuring the quantities of unreacted methacrylate groups remaining in the polymers using an infrared (FT-IR, Magna 550, Nicolet) spectroscopy technique.
      <br/>
      The ambient temperature photopolymerization conversion efficiency of a conventional Bis-GMA/TEGDMA resin (3:1 mas ratio) is in the range of 55% to 65%.
      <br/>
      Ideally, dental polymers would combine a high degrees of conversion, which improves mechanical properties and long-term stability, with low levels of polymerization shrinkage.
      <br/>
      The cyclopolymerizable oligomers considered here offer one method to attempt to satisfy these apparently contradictory goals.
      <br/>
      Likewise, monomers and oligomers designed with relatively low reactive group densities should also provide low shrinkage polymers.
      <br/>
      The degree of conversion of selected fluorinated resins was in the range of 70% to 80%.
      <br/>
      Part of the reason for the high conversion levels obtained with the fluorinated resins is likely a result of the lower cohesive energy of fluoropolymers.
      <br/>
      Since the typical ambient photopolymerization of dental resins and composites is limited by vitrification as the polymeric glass transition temperature (Tg) reaches the cure temperature, it is reasonable to expect higher conversion in fluorinated resins that start with a lower monomeric tg than comparable hydrocarbon resins.

    <p num="160">
      The photocure of dental resins resulted in the formation of highly crosslinked, vitrified polymers that contain significant residual stresses due to polymerization shrinkage.
      <br/>
      These stresses can cause microcrack and void formation within the resin, debonding at the resin-filler interface, and marginal gap formation between the restoration and tooth substrate.
      <br/>
      Excessive polymerization shrinkage is one of the most serious problems related to the clinical application of dental resins and composites.
      <br/>
      In this evaluation, the polymerization shrinkage of the experimental fluorinated resins was measured using a mercury-filled dilatometer.
      <br/>
      This device provides quantitative dynamic measurements of the photo-induced polymerization shrinkage.
      <br/>
      A schematic diagram of the dilatometer is shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The simultaneous measurement of the mercury height and temperature allows thermal effects, such as the energy input from the visible light source and the resulting polymerization exotherm, to be separated from the continuous shrinkage measurement.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      The volumetric shrinkage of a visible light photocured dental resin composed of Bis-GMA/TEGDMA (7:3 mass ratio) measured at 1 h was 7.96%. This result obtained with the mercury dilatometer is somewhat larger than the 6.95% volumetric contraction calculated for an identical resin photocured in a linear shrinkage measurement device.
      <br/>
      Differences in irradiation intensity could account for these differences.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5, the percent volume contraction for the Bis-GMA/TEGDMA resin is plotted as a function of time during the photopolymerization.
      <br/>
      The shrinkage profile shows the volumetric change over the first 60 minutes as well as an expanded view of the first 30 seconds.
      <br/>
      The difference between the apparent shrinkage of 5.73% at 60 min and the reported value of 7.96% results from the need to compensate for a small amount of microfine silica filler (OX-50, Deguessa) added to the resin to decrease flow of the sample in the dilatometer prior to irradiation.
      <br/>
      Based on this same measurement technique, the polymerization shrinkages of the fluorinated resins based on 3a, 3b and 6 were calculated to be 4.14, 5.57 and 6.02%, respectively (Table I and FIGS. 4a-4j).
      <br/>
      Thus, the shrinkage of these cyclopolymerizable resins is significantly less than that of the Bis-GMA/TEGDMA material.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      The polymerization shrinkages of activated resins based on 8a (M-1), 8b (M-2), and 8c (M-3) were calculated as 3.558, 3.376, and 4.065%, respectively.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 6a-6d show shrinkages of various samples versus time.
      <br/>
      Comparing these lower polymerization shrinkages to that of Bis-GMA (7.2%) by procedures of Venhoven, B. A. M., DeGee, A. J., Davidson, C. L., Biomaterials 1993, 14(11), 871; Stansbury, J. W. , Antonucci, J. M., Dent. Mater. 1992, 8, 270; and Venz, S., Dickens, B., J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 1991, 25, 1231, shows the fluorinated monomers of the present invention result in dental polymers having lower volume shrinkage.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      Thus, the polymerization shrinkage values obtained with resins based on the fluoroligomers 8a, 8b and 8c are measured in a range of 3% to 4%, which is less than half the Bis-GMA/TEGDMA contraction.
      <br/>
      The combination of the inert spacer units within the oligomer and the relatively rigid backbone structure are the likely reasons for the extremely low polymerization shrinkage values obtained with these three resins.
      <br/>
      The resin based on the fluorinated urethane dimethacrylate 12 also provides very low shrinkage.
      <br/>
      The shrinkage for the resin based on monomer 13 is surprisingly low considering its tetrafunctional structure.
      <br/>
      The significant reductions in polymerization shrinkage offered by these fluorinated resins compared with Bis-GMA/TEGDMA should ease the levels of residual stress and enhance the potential longevity of the polymerized resins and composites.
      <br/>
      Reduced shrinkage will also provide less change to the vulnerable restoration-tooth interface.
      <br/>
      The relatively high polymerization shrinkage values obtained with the resins based on monomers 10a and 10b points to high levels of conversion in these systems.
      <br/>
      Very high degrees of conversion have been observed previously with hydrocarbon resins based on the chain-extended oligomeric product of Bis-GMA and DDI.
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      An indication of the photopolymerization kinetics of the various resin systems is revealed in the dynamic shrinkage data.
      <br/>
      The initial slope of the photocure shrinkage curve of the Bis-GMANTEGDMA resin was calculated as 27.2 vol %/min.
      <br/>
      The early stage of the photopolymerization of each fluorinated resin is shown in the inset boxes of the shrinkage plots (FIGS. 2a-2j). the initial slopes of photocure curves of resins obtained from the fluorinated monomers and oligomers were calculated as 17.0, 19.0, 10.4, 17.4, 9.8, 9.5 and 15.3 vol. %/min, respectively.
      <br/>
      From this indirect measure of photopolymerization kinetics, it appears that among the fluorinated oligomers capable of cyclopolymerization, the bulky, branched oligomer 6 was the least reactive.
      <br/>
      The resin based on 6 also retained its initial linear cure rate significantly longer than any other resin in the study.
      <br/>
      Within the series of oligomers 8a-c, the unsubstituted oligomer 8a, even through higher in oligomeric molecular weight (by GPC compared with oligomers 8b and 8c), produced a resin with a much higher rate of cure than the C6 and C8 perfluoro-substituted homologs 8b and 8c, respectively.
      <br/>
      The resin containing the relatively small difunctional fluorinated monomer 12 provided no increase in the rate of photopolymerization compared with the oligomeric resins and was less reactive than the Bis-GMA/TEGDMA dimethacrylate resin.
      <br/>
      A decrease in mobility due to hydrogen bonding between urethane groups in 12 may be part of the explanation as to why this dimethacrylate-based resin was less reactive.
      <br/>
      In additional, more oxygen may be present in the resins with the higher fluorine contents.
      <br/>
      The dissolved oxygen would serve as a free radical inhibitor of the photopolymerization process.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      In particular, FIGS. 2a-2j show the volume shrinkages as a function of time after the samples were irradiated.
      <br/>
      Slopes of volume shrinkages at an earlier photocuring stage for activated resins based on 8a (M-1), 8b (M-2), and 8c (M-3) were calculated as 17.40, 9.78, and 9.46, respectively.
      <br/>
      The activated resin based on M-1 shows a rapid volume shrinkage two times faster than those of resins based on M-2 and M-3.
      <br/>
      According to GPC results, a weight average molecular weight of M-1 was higher (Mw=17,175) than those of resins based on M-2 and M-3.
      <br/>
      Thus, the higher degree of polymerization would cause a rapid volume shrinkage of M-1.
      <br/>
      The degree of conversion obtained for the various multifunctional fluoroprepolymers described here was successfully increased to 70 to 80% as a result of the cyclopolymerization process and the lower cohesive energy inherent in fluoropolymers.
      <br/>
      The low values of polymerization shrinkage associated with all these novel fluorinated composites is another important criteria in judging their potential as prospective dental materials.
      <br/>
      Minimized polymerization shrinkage improves the clinical performance of composite restorations.
      <br/>
      While traditional dental resins produce volumetric shrinkages of 7 to 9%, some of the fluorinated resins of the present invention offer reductions of 50% or more.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows the volume shrinkage for the Bis-GMA/TEGDMA resin.

      Either amorphous quartz or sodium borosilicate glass particulate filers, which had been silanized with 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, were combined with the resins to prepare to the photocurable pastes (Table I).
      <br/>
      The quartz filler was used because it provides a reasonably good refractive index match (nD20 =1.4585) with the various fluorinated resins.
      <br/>
      For the most part, the quartz filler loading level was fixed at a 2:1 mass ratio (filler to resin).
      <br/>
      The glass filler was included because of the radiopacity that results from its barium content.
      <br/>
      It is often desirable to have dental restorative materials that can be visualized by X-ray for the diagnostic purposes.
      <br/>
      The barium glass filler has a refractive index (nD20 ca. 1.55) that is substantially higher than that of any of the resins examined here, including the bromine-containing resin.
      <br/>
      However, the resin containing 3b did produce the most translucent glass-filled composite samples.
      <br/>
      For each fluorinated resin, the glass filler loading level was allowed to vary such that a composite paste with an easily handlable consistency was achieved.
      <br/>
      With the exception of the resin from 3b, which is more dense due to the bromine content, the densities of the fluorinated resins increased with the fluorine content.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      In an examination of the hydrophobic nature of the fluorinated composites, water contact angle and water uptake were measured for photocured disks with the results listed in Table II.
      <br/>
      The static water contact angles measured on fluorocomposite disks were relatively high, especially when compared with that of a quartz-filled Bis-GMA/TEGDMA composite (68.6 (degree) ).
      <br/>
      In general, there were only very weak correlations between either contact angle or water uptake and the percentage of fluorine present in the various resins.
      <br/>
      In all cases except one, the quartz-filled composites had greater water uptake than the corresponding glass-filled composites.
      <br/>
      However, this difference appears to be related to the level of filler loading rather than the filler type.
      <br/>
      The use of glass filler allowed the formulation of composites with significantly higher filler contents than could be achieved using quartz filler.
      <br/>
      When the water uptake data are normalized to account for the fraction of resin in each composite, there are only modest differences between quartz and glass filled materials.
      <br/>
      The type of filler in the composite had no influence on the contact angle.
      <br/>
      This would be expected since the composite surfaces tested were polymerized against mylar and would be rich in the resin phase.
      <br/>
      Different results might be anticipated if polished surfaces that exposed more of the filler particles were used for the contact angle measurements.
      <br/>
      The presence of hydrogen bonding urethane groups may be responsible for the relatively low water contact angles measured for the composites containing 10 and 13.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      The equilibrium water uptake of the various fluorinated composites is shown in Table II.
      <br/>
      There does appear to be some correlation between the percentage of fluorine in a given resin and the water sorption of its corresponding composite material.
      <br/>
      The series of composites based on 8a-c, which have the highest levels of fluorine incorporated, produced the lowest levels of water uptake.
      <br/>
      Structural features other than the percentage of fluorine in these monomers also influence the amount of water uptake in a composite.
      <br/>
      The relatively high water sorption observed for materials based on oligomer 6 can be explained by the high concentration of hydroxyl groups in this oligomer.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the cyclopolymerizable bromine-substituted oligomers 3b provided relatively low water uptake as did monomers 10a and 10b even with their polar urethane functional groups.
      <br/>
      For comparison, the water uptake of a comparable quartz filled composite based on Bis-GMA/TEGDMA (7:3 mass ratio) was 1.22 mass percent.
      <br/>
      Therefore, most of the composites based on these fluorinated resins show a significant improvement in hydrophobicity over that characteristic of conventional dental composite materials.
      <br/>
      The water uptake into quartz filled composites as a function of immersion time is shown in FIGS. 3a-3c. The pattern of water uptake for the composites based on oligomers 3a, 3b and 8c is similar with a relatively gradual approach to an equilibrium value.
      <br/>
      This differs from the more rapid water uptake profiles for composites based on oligomers 8b, 10a, 10b and 12, which reach a plateau region in less than 100 hours of immersion.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      FIG. 3 shows the water uptakes of the highly fluorinated dental composites.
      <br/>
      In the plots of water uptake measurements for composites based on M-1(8a), M-2(8b), and M-3(8c), the data points reached their maximum region within 100 hours.
      <br/>
      Water uptake % s based on the monomers were measured at very low values, 0.1-0.2 wt. %. Water uptake % of a composite based on Bis-GMA was reported as 3.8 wt % according to the following references Venhoven, B. A. M., DeGee, A. J., Davidson, C. L., Biomaterials 1993, 14(11), 871; Stansbury, J. W., Antonucci, J. M., Dent. Mater. 1992, 8, 270; and Venz, S. Dickens, B. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 1991, 25, 1231.

      Within the series of composites based on prepolymers M-1(8a), M-2(8b), and M-3(8c), the mechanical strength decreases with increasing fluorine content.
      <br/>
      However, all these materials and especially composites containing prepolymer M-1 (8a), demonstrated good strength properties.
      <br/>
      The enhanced mechanical strength observed with prepolymer M-1 (8a) was probably due to its very rigid regular backbone structure.
      <br/>
      The water uptake among this series of composites was extremely low.

      The results of three-point bending flexural strength (FS) measurements for photocured bar specimens of the fluorinated composites are summarized in Table II.
      <br/>
      The stress-strain curves generated during testing to failure can be analyzed to obtain both the flexural strength and the flexural modulus of the composites.
      <br/>
      Representative individual plots of the transverse strength measurements of the fluorinated composites are shown in FIGS. 4a-4j.
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      Most commercial dental composites which have been used in dental applications show flexural strength of 90 MPa to 140 MPa.
      <br/>
      The flexural strength results of the prepared composites of the present invention show that there are several fluorinated monomer or oligomer structures that have potential as high strength materials.
      <br/>
      The composites based on 8a and 10a appear to offer the best combination of high mechanical strength and low water uptake.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 6a-6d show water uptake as a function of immersion time into quartz filled samples.
      <br/>
      The good strength of the fluorinated composites could likely be improved by the use of a silane coupling agent other than 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, that has better compatibility with the fluorinated resins.
      <br/>
      Preliminary results using a more hydrophobic coupling agent have demonstrated that significantly higher filler loading can be achieved in composites prepared with fluorinated resins.
      <br/>
      The incorporation of more filler should improve not only the mechanical strength of the fluorinated composites, but also further reduce polymerization shrinkage and water uptake.
    </p>
    <p num="173">
      In particular, FIGS. 4a-4j and Table II, show and list, respectively, the results of three-point bending flexural strength (FS) (transverse strength (TS)) measurements on the fluorocomposites.
      <br/>
      The three-point bending flexural strength (TS) measurements show excellent results.
      <br/>
      The high strength polymeric networks derived from (meth)acrylate resins with moderate to high organofluorine contents produced a high physical strength (70-120 MPa).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, two straight lines show the flexure modulus curve and the integration curve.
      <br/>
      The modulus of fluorocomposites based on 8a/Q (M-1), 8b/Q (M-2), and 8c/Q (M-3) and filled with quartz filler were measured as 11.5, 10.8, and 10.2 GPa, respectively.

      A powdered glass-filled composite based on the Bis-GMNTEGDMA resin (1:4 resin-filler by mass) provides DTS and TS values of 50.5 +- 1.3 MPa and 91.4 +- 8.5 MPa, respectively, as reported by Hu, H. S. W., Griffith, J. R. Polym. Prepr. 1993, 34(1), 401; Guo, X. A. Hunter, A. D., Chen, J. J. Polym. Sci.: Polym. Chem. 1994, 32, 47; Jariwala, C. P., Mathias, L. J. Macromolecules 1993, 26, 5129.
