      A remediation agent and process produces a treated water that meets discharge standards required by local regulations and generates stabilized waste which does not require further treatment prior to disposal.
      <br/>
      The composition of the treatment chemical is applicable to the treatment of industrial wastewaters and more specifically those from automobile production, metal finishing, metal processing, oil refineries, textiles, wood treatment, tannery, circuit board manufacturing, and other miscellaneous industrial waste streams from operations such as paints, coatings, adhesives, soap and detergents, chemicals, and food processing.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a chemical composition and its use for remediation of waste streams including those from municipal and industrial sources containing high levels of contaminants such as fat, oil, grease, soluble and insoluble heavy metals, organic matter and inorganic matter.
      <br/>
      The composition includes natural minerals such as clay, zeolites, apatite, Dolomitic lime, fly ash, cement, coagulants, and flocculants which are either cationic, anionic or nonionic in nature.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Prior Developments</p>
    <p num="4">
      Waste streams generally contain contaminants such as fat, oil, grease, heavy metals, organic substances such as phenolics, chlorinated compounds, and inorganics such as fluoride, sulfate, phosphate, cyanide, chromates, arsenic and selenium, at levels considered hazardous to the environment and which could pose a risk to public health.
      <br/>
      Such contaminants must be removed or their levels reduced to meet government discharge standards prior to discharging the waste into the environment.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Waste streams are generally treated by chemical, physical or mechanical means, or by combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Techniques used in conventional wastewater treatment for removing emulsified soluble or floating oils, suspended solids, heavy metals, organic and inorganic matters basically involve several steps such as demulsification, oil skimming, metal precipitation, flocculation, and settling.
      <br/>
      Each step takes place in a separate tank and the entire treatment requires multiple adjustments of pH and the addition of acid, emulsion breakers (demulsifiers), lime/caustic, coagulants, and polymer solutions.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      This conventional multi-step process is time consuming and has a high demand for equipment, i.e., it requires a number of treatment tanks equipped with agitators, pumps, liquid chemical dispensers and feed lines, chemicals, manpower, and energy.
      <br/>
      In each step, wastewater may be recirculated several times for retreatment to effect the maximum removal of contaminants, before it goes to the next step.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Moreover, the generated solid waste typically contains high levels of heavy metals and other hazardous substances which are usually leachable.
      <br/>
      The waste therefore requires further treatment to render the solid waste non-hazardous before it can be safely disposed.
      <br/>
      The cost of the disposal of hazardous waste is three to four times the disposal cost of nonhazardous waste.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The use of chemical agents for treating wastewater is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,956,117, 3,428,558, 3,968,036, 4,167,481, 4,517,094, 5,336,704, and 5,415,808.
      <br/>
      These earlier inventions, however, suffer from disadvantages relating to their limited applications, i.e., the chemical agents are not stand-alone products.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,956,117 discloses the use of cationic polymers for removal of oil; U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,428,558, and 5,415,808 disclose polymeric flocculants and their use in the removal of suspended particles; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,167,481 and 5,336,704 disclose chemical compositions for removal of metals; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,968,036 and 4,517,094 disclose methods for removal of organics.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      None of these earlier inventions discloses a single agent or composition that is capable of simultaneous removal of contaminants such as oil and grease, suspended solids, heavy metals, and other organic and inorganic matter.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in most cases, prior treatment processes are also tedious and laborious such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,167,481 and 4,517,094 or those inventions wherein a conventional multi-step process is required when polymeric flocculants are used.
      <br/>
      Most importantly, these earlier inventions are not cost effective and generate solid wastes that are normally hazardous and must be further treated prior to disposal.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      More recently, attention has been focused on the development of a single product system for treatment of waste streams, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,953,330, 4,332,693, 4,415,467, and 4,765,908.
      <br/>
      These products suffer from disadvantages due to non-versatility, i.e., they are generally applicable to a specific type of waste stream, e.g., oil, metals, or organic contaminated waste streams.
      <br/>
      Moreover, their manufacturing processes are complex, the compositions work in a narrow range of pH, they are slow to react with contaminants, and they produce solid waste that may not pass the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure test (TCLP) instituted by the US EPA.
      <br/>
      These products also do not work well in the presence of chelating and complexing agents, they usually require a pretreatment step to break the chelate or a post treatment step with a polishing agent, and they are costly to use on a commercial scale.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Accordingly, what is needed is an economical single treatment agent or chemical composition for remediation of waste streams, and more particularly industrial waste streams, which is capable of simultaneously and efficiently removing up to several thousand ppm of fat, oil, grease, suspended solids, soluble and insoluble heavy metals, and other organic and inorganic matters, resulting in treated water that meets discharge standards set by environmental authorities.</p>
    <p num="12">A further need exists for such a single treatment agent which leads to the formation of a fast settling floc that is easily dewatered.</p>
    <p num="13">A further need exists for a process that removes hazardous contaminants from a waste stream and isolates them in a stabilized non-leaching matrix.</p>
    <p num="14">A further need exists for such an agent and process which generates solid waste that does not require further treatment in order to pass the TCLP test and does not pose a hazard to the environment once disposed in a landfill.</p>
    <p num="15">A further need exists for such a composition that is very versatile and works effectively over a wide pH range of, e.g. 2-12, and has an uptake capacity that is independent of the presence of surfactants, detergents, hardness, and chelating/complexing agents.</p>
    <p num="16">A further need exists for such a composition which produces a non-slimy sludge which does not block or clog sludge filters such as filter presses.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      The present invention has been developed to meet, and does in fact meet, the needs noted above and therefore has as an object the provision of a single-composition, simultaneous-process for the treatment of wastewater that can be carried out in either a batch process or in a continuous process.
      <br/>
      In a batch process, a single treatment tank is sufficient and the treatment agent can be added manually or through a dry powder feeder.
      <br/>
      Addition of a settling tank may enhance the efficiency of the sedimentation process when treating large volumes of water.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Synergistic effects, brought about by the various components of the treatment composition, enhance the reaction rate between the composition and contaminants in the waste stream.
      <br/>
      Such effects are fully utilized in the continuous process such that the treatment can handle the incoming waste streams at flow rates as high as 1000 gal/min.
      <br/>
      The treatment composition can be fed continuously at a predetermined feed rate using automated feed equipment.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The sludge can be dewatered via a filtration system such as a vacuum filtration system, a centrifuge, and most preferably a filter press which is simple and relatively easy to maintain.
      <br/>
      Treated water is drained off and released or recycled for reuse and the solid waste is hauled away without the need for further treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="20">A further object of this invention is to provide a treatment technology that produces high quality treated water suitable for reuse in manufacturing processes without the high cost of utilizing membrane separation technology or other technologies.</p>
    <p num="21">
      A treatment agent for the remediation of waste streams has been developed in accordance with this invention for simultaneously removing virtually all contaminants in the waste stream.
      <br/>
      Contaminants removed by the treatment agent include fats, oil, grease, other organic matters, suspended solids, and soluble heavy metals which exist as positive ions such as aluminum, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, silver, tin, titanium, zinc as well as radioactive elements such as uranium, thorium, and plutonium.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In addition, the treatment agent and process according to the invention are effective in removing negative ions such as sulfate, fluoride, phosphate, hexavalent chromium, arsenic and selenium.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the compositions of this invention are effective in lowering the levels of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) in waste streams.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The chemical composition of the present invention can include natural aluminosilicates such as natural clays, and a blend of natural and synthetic minerals which includes natural clay, Dolomitic lime, cement, fly ash and phosphate rocks.
      <br/>
      The chemical composition of the present invention can further include, individually, zeolites, Dolomitic lime, apatite, cement, and fly ash.
      <br/>
      Additional components can include coagulating agents which are either organic, inorganic or combinations thereof, and flocculating agents which are either cationic, anionic, nonionic or combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      These ingredients work synergistically to enhance the reactions kinetics between the contaminants in the waste stream and the treatment agent, leading to an increased uptake capacity, up to several thousands of ppm, and formation of a highly stabilized waste which typically requires no further treatment in order to pass the TCLP test.
      <br/>
      The nature of contaminants present in the various waste steams and their concentrations may vary widely from case to case and therefore the percentage of each component in the composition is determined and adjusted accordingly within the scope of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Treatment agents of the present invention are very cost effective and react quickly to remove contaminants from wastewater.
      <br/>
      Such use produces a high-quality treated effluent that meets discharge standards or requirements for reuse, and also produces a stabilized solid waste.
      <br/>
      With the treatment compositions of the present invention, the treatment process, which previously has generally been a multi-step process, is now reduced to a single step and requires fewer treatment vessels and only one dispenser to deliver the treatment composition.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The treatment composition of this invention is also effective over a wide waste stream pH range, i.e., 2-12, and therefore in most applications initial and post treatment pH adjustments are not required.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the reaction between the composition of the present invention and contaminants in the waste stream is independent of the presence of chelating and/or complexing agents and, accordingly, use of polishing agents such as sulfides, dithiocarbamates and other noxious chemicals or the application of a pretreatment to break the chelate is no longer necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Due to the fast reaction rate of the present treatment process and the high capacity of the treatment agents in taking up and immobilizing contaminants, a continuous treatment process can handle waste streams having flow rates as high as 1000 gal/min.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the process of the present invention is simple and relatively inexpensive which makes it possible and affordable for small operators to set up their own treatment systems.
      <br/>
      This, in turn, reduces the demand put on treatment facilities such as publicly owned treatment works (POTW), and waste and waste treatment plants.
    </p>
    <p num="27">In summary, the present invention provides:</p>

The finished product is a fine, virtually homogeneous, and free flowing solid for use in treating wastewater.</p>
    <p num="50">
      It should be noted that the core of the invention is based on the use of one or more powdered natural silicates such as aluminosilicates which include natural clays and zeolites in combination with fly ash and/or silica fume, cement, and Dolomitic lime.
      <br/>
      These four basic constituents when combined in sufficient amounts are effective to provide the results discussed above.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      It should be noted that natural silicates may be provided in virtually any form of commercial product and need not be further treated as is often the case in prior processes and compositions for waste stream treatment.
      <br/>
      Fly ash, silica fume, and cement may be mixed separately or provided in a commercially available mixed form known as fly ash cement and silica fume cement.
      <br/>
      This combined product should meet the weight requirements for both silica fume/fly ash and cement as specified above.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      A particularly important component of the treatment composition is Dolomitic lime.
      <br/>
      Although ordinary lime functions adequately, Dolomitic lime is preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Once these basic constituents are combined, i.e., natural silicates, fly ash and/or silica fume, cement and Dolomitic lime, the additional constituents individually or in the combinations noted above provide further improved performance in the treatment of waste streams.
      <br/>
      A particularly effective treatment composition has been found to include by weight percent, from 5 to 85% natural silicate, from 5 to 85% cement, from 2 to 23% fly ash; from 5 to 58% Dolomitic lime; from 0 to 40% coagulant; from 0.2 to 5.5% flocculating agent, and from 2 to 40% phosphate rock.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The treatment compositions noted above may be used in both batch and continuous treatment processes by adding from 0.01 g/L to 10 g/L of the treatment composition to a treatment tank, mixing the composition with the waste stream in the treatment tank and forming a sludge from the waste stream.
      <br/>
      The sludge is formed by a non-slimy floc which does not easily clog filters such as sand filters and filter presses.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Batch processes typically require mixing the composition and waste stream over a period of about 1 to 15 minutes.
      <br/>
      A floc is quickly formed which then forms a highly stabilized sludge that can be filtered, dried and disposed as a solid waste in a landfill without further treatment insofar as the waste passes the TCLP test and the treated water can be immediately reused or drained into a sewer since it meets all governmental environmental requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      In a continuous process, a floc is formed in a clarifier and the overflow from the clarifier can be drained directly into a sewer.
      <br/>
      The resulting sludge can be removed from the clarifier and dewatered, and is so well stabilized that it can, without further treatment, be legally disposed in a landfill.
      <br/>
      The composition can effectively treat waste streams flowing at up to 1000 gallons per minute.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Using either a batch or continuous process, the treatment composition formulated according to the teachings above can remove a very wide range of contaminants.
      <br/>
      Such contaminants include oil and/or grease present in the waste stream in amounts up to 150,000 ppm, heavy metals including aluminum, cadmium, chromium (III), cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, silver, tin, titanium, zinc and radioactive metals including plutonium, uranium and thorium.
      <br/>
      Further, such contaminants include fluoride, phosphate, chromium (VI), arsenic and selenium in anionic form.
      <br/>
      All of the above contaminants can be removed from municipal wastewater, industrial wastewater, contaminated ground water and concentrated liquors in accordance with the invention.
