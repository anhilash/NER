    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to compounds, compositions and methods for the treatment of influenza infection.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention relates to novel pyridazine derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing such derivatives and their use in treating influenza infection and other viral diseases.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      There are three known influenza-type viruses which affect human beings: Influenza A, B and C. Influenza A viruses have been isolated from many animal species in addition to humans, while the influenza B and C viruses infect mainly humans.
      <br/>
      The influenza viruses are enveloped viruses containing negative single-stranded RNA's which are segmented and encapsidated.
      <br/>
      The influenza virus envelope is characterized by the presence of two surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase.
      <br/>
      The influenza A and B virions are pleomorphic and are usually 80-120 nm in diameter.
      <br/>
      The influenza C virion has many distinctive properties and is thus distinguished from the closely related A and B virions.
      <br/>
      Infection with influenza A or B often can cause a highly contagious, acute respiratory illness.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Influenza viruses have a major impact on morbidity leading to increases in hospitalization and in visits to health care providers.
      <br/>
      High rates of hospitalization are observed for patients over 65 years of age and also for children less than 5 years of age.
      <br/>
      Influenza virus is also unique among respiratory viruses in being a cause of excess mortality.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the spread of influenza virus through a population can result in epidemics which have considerable economic impact.
      <br/>
      For example, high rates of mortality were observed due to influenza infection during the influenza epidemics of 1957, 1968 and 1977.

    </p>

      There are relatively few known compounds that have significant anti-viral activity against influenza viruses.
      <br/>
      Two of these, amantadine and rimantadine are approved in the United States for the treatment of influenza virus disease.
      <br/>
      Both compounds are most effective when used prophylactically and influenza viruses develop resistance to both compounds rapidly.

    </p>
    <p num="28">Isomers of the compound of Formula I, above, that are within the scope of the invention include, without limitation, tautomeric forms of such compound.</p>
    <p num="29">As previously noted, the compounds of Formula I, above, including their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, exhibit antiviral activity against influenza virus.</p>
    <p num="30">The compounds of the invention can form salts with inorganic and organic bases, including, for example, alkali metal salts, such as Na or K salts, alkaline earth metal salts, such as Ca or Mg salts, ammonium, substituted ammonium and other amine salts such as morpholine, piperidine or pyridine salts.</p>
    <p num="31">The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I are prepared following procedures which are familiar to those skilled in the art.</p>
    <p num="32">The antiviral pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise one or more of the compounds of formula I above, as the active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier medium or auxiliary agent.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The composition may be prepared in various forms for administration, including tablets, caplets, pills or dragees, or can be filled in suitable containers, such as capsules, or, in the case of suspensions, filled into bottles.
      <br/>
      As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier medium" includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired.
      <br/>
      Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fifteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1975) discloses various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutical compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof.
      <br/>
      Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the anti-viral compounds of the invention, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other component(s) of the pharmaceutical composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention.
      <br/>
      In the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, the active agent may be present in an amount of at least 0.1% and not more than 50% by weight based on the total weight of the composition, including carrier medium and/or auxiliary agent(s).
      <br/>
      Preferably, the proportion of active agent varies between 0.1 to 5% by weight of the composition.
      <br/>
      Pharmaceutical organic or inorganic solid or liquid carrier media suitable for enteral or parenteral administration can be used to make up the composition.
      <br/>
      Gelatine, lactose, starch, magnesium, stearate, talc, vegetable and animal fats and oils, gum, polyalkylene glycol, or other known carriers for medicaments may all be suitable as carrier media.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The compounds of the invention may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for attenuating infectivity of the influenza virus.
      <br/>
      Thus, the expression "amount effective to attenuate infectivity of influenza virus", as used herein, refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the antiviral agent to provide the desired treatment of viral infection.
      <br/>
      The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular antiviral agent, its mode of administration, and the like.
      <br/>
      The anti-influenza compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.
      <br/>
      The expression "dosage unit form" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of anti-viral agent appropriate for the patient to be treated.
      <br/>
      Each dosage should contain the quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect either as such, or in association with the selected pharmaceutical carrier medium.
      <br/>
      Typically, the anti-viral compounds of the invention will be administered in dosage units containing from about 5 mg to about 500 mg of the anti-viral agent with a range of about 0.1 mg to about 50 mg being preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The compounds of the invention may be administered orally, parenterally, such as by intramuscular injection, intraperitoneal injection, aerosol, intravenous infusion or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.1 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about 2 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of patient body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Although the pyridazine derivatives described herein can be administered to any patient which is susceptible to influenza infection, the compounds are intended for the treatment of mammalian hosts, and especially humans.</p>
    <p num="37">
      The compounds of the invention will typically be administered from 1 to 3 times a day so as to deliver the above-mentioned daily dosage.
      <br/>
      However, the exact regimen for administration of the compounds and compositions described herein will necessarily be dependent on the needs of the individual patient being treated, the type of treatment administered and the judgment of the attending physician.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In view of the inhibitory effect on influenza virus transcriptase produced by the compounds of the invention, it is anticipated that these compounds will be useful not only for therapeutic treatment of infection, but for influenza viral prophylaxis, as well.
      <br/>
      The above-noted dosages will be essentially the same whether for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza infection.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The following examples are provided to describe the invention in further detail.
