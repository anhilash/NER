  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">This Appln claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional No. 60/086,211 filed May 21, 1998.</p>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to a process for preparing a catalyst.
      <br/>
      In particular, the invention relates to a process for preparing a catalyst which is efficient in converting alkanes to unsaturated aldehydes and carboxylic acids, a catalyst prepared from the process, and a process for preparing unsaturated aldehydes and carboxylic acids using the catalyst.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Unsaturated aldehydes and carboxylic acids are important commercial chemicals.
      <br/>
      Of particular importance is (meth)acrylic acid.
      <br/>
      The highly reactive double bond and acid function of (meth)acrylic acid makes it especially suitable as a monomer which may be polymerized alone or with other monomers to produce commercially important polymers.
      <br/>
      These unsaturated acids are also useful as a starting material for esterification to produce commercially important (meth)acrylate esters.
      <br/>
      Materials derived from (meth)acrylic acid or esters of (meth)acrylic acids are useful as plastic sheets and parts, paints and other coatings, adhesives, caulks, sealants, and detergents as well as other applications.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The production of unsaturated carboxylic acids by oxidation of an olefin is well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Acrylic acid, for instance, may be commercially manufactured by the gas phase oxidation of propylene.
      <br/>
      It is also known that unsaturated carboxylic acids may also be prepared by oxidation of alkanes.
      <br/>
      For instance, acrylic acid may be prepared by the oxidation of propane.
      <br/>
      Such a process is especially desirable because alkanes generally have a lower cost than olefins.
      <br/>
      For example, at the time of filing this application propylene costs approximately three times more than propane.
      <br/>
      A suitable process for the oxidation of alkanes to unsaturated aldehydes or carboxylic acids which is commercially viable has yet to be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      One impediment for the production of a commercially viable process for the catalytic oxidation of an alkane to an unsaturated carboxylic acid is the identification of a catalyst having adequate conversion and suitable selectivity, thereby providing sufficient yield of the unsaturated carboxylic acid end-product. U.S. Pat. No. 5,380,933 discloses a method for preparing a catalyst useful in the gas phase oxidation of an alkane to an unsaturated carboxylic acid.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed method, a catalyst was prepared by combining ammonium metavanadate, telluric acid and ammonium paramolybdate to obtain a uniform aqueous solution.
      <br/>
      To this solution was added ammonium niobium oxalate to obtain a slurry.
      <br/>
      The water was removed from the slurry to obtain a solid catalyst precursor.
      <br/>
      The solid catalyst precursor was molded into a tablet, sieved to a desired particle size and then calcined at 600 (degree)  C. under a nitrogen stream to obtain the desired catalyst.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The resulting catalyst was asserted to be effective to convert propane to acrylic acid.
      <br/>
      However, as shown herein, the present inventor was unable to reproduce the asserted results using the preparation method of the '933 patent.
      <br/>
      While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the poor performance of the prior art method of '933 results from compositional or phase segregation of the component elements of the catalyst, e.g., in the slurry between solid and liquid phases and during calcining between the gas and various solid phases.
      <br/>
      The present inventor has now discovered a process for preparing a catalyst for catalyzing an alkane into an unsaturated aldehyde or carboxylic acid wherein phase segregation is minimized and improvement in selectivity, conversion, and yield are achieved.

      For purposes of this application by "solution" is meant that greater than 95 percent of metal solid added to a solvent is dissolved.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the greater the amount of metal solid not initially in solution, the poorer the performance of the catalyst derived therefrom will be.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As recited above, a process for preparing a catalyst is disclosed.
      <br/>
      In a first step of the process a solution is formed by admixing metal compounds, at least one of which contains oxygen, and at least one solvent in appropriate amounts to form the solution.
      <br/>
      Generally, the metal compounds contain elements A, M, N, X, and O. In one embodiment, A is selected from Mo, W, Fe, Nb, Ta, Zr, Ru and mixtures thereof; M is selected from V, Ce, Cr and mixtures thereof; N is selected from Te, Bi, Sb, Se and mixtures thereof; and X is selected from Nb, Ta, W, Ti, Al, Zr, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ni, Pd, Pt, Sb, Bi, B, In, Ce and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, A is selected from Mo, W and mixtures thereof; M is selected from V, Ce, Cr and mixtures thereof; N is selected from Te, Bi, Sb and mixtures thereof; and X is selected from Nb, Ta, Zr, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      In a more preferred embodiment, A is Mo, M is V, N is Te and X is Nb.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Suitable solvents include water, alcohols including, but not limited to, methanol, ethanol, propanol, and diols etc, as well as other polar solvents known in the art.
      <br/>
      Generally, water is preferred.
      <br/>
      The water is any water suitable for use in chemical synthesis including, without limitation, distilled water and deionized water.
      <br/>
      The amount of water present is that amount sufficient to keep the elements substantially in solution long enough to avoid or minimize compositional and/or phase segregation during the preparation steps.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the amount of water will vary according to the amounts and solubility of materials combined.
      <br/>
      However, as stated above the amount of water must be sufficient to insure an aqueous solution is formed and not a slurry at the time of mixing.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Once the aqueous solution is formed, the water is removed by any suitable method known in the art to form a catalyst precursor.
      <br/>
      Such methods include, without limitation, vacuum drying, freeze drying, spray drying, rotary evaporation, and air drying.
      <br/>
      Vacuum drying is generally performed at pressures ranging from 10 to 500 mm/Hg.
      <br/>
      Freeze drying typically entails freezing the solution, using for instance liquid nitrogen, and drying the frozen solution under vacuum.
      <br/>
      Spray drying is generally performed under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon, with an inlet temperature ranging from 125 (degree)  C. to 200 (degree)  C. and an outlet temperature ranging from 75 (degree)  C. to 150 (degree)  C. Rotary evaporation is generally performed at a bath temperature of from 25 (degree)  C. to 90 (degree)  C. and a pressure of from 10 mm/Hg to 760 mm/Hg, preferably at a bath temperature of from 40 (degree)  C. to 90 (degree)  C. and a pressure from 10 mm/Hg to 350 mm/Hg, more preferably from 40 (degree)  C. to 60 (degree)  C. and a pressure of from 10 mm/Hg to 40 mm/Hg.
      <br/>
      Air drying may be occur at temperatures ranging from 25 (degree)  C. to 90 (degree)  C. Rotary evaporation or air drying are generally preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Once obtained, the catalyst precursor is calcined under an inert atmosphere.
      <br/>
      The inert atmosphere may be any material which is substantially inert, i.e., does not react or interact with, the catalyst precursor.
      <br/>
      Suitable examples include, without limitation, nitrogen, argon, xenon, helium or mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the inert atmosphere is argon or nitrogen, more preferably argon.
      <br/>
      The inert atmosphere may flow over the surface of the catalyst precursor or may not flow (a static environment).
      <br/>
      It is important to understand that by non-flow atmosphere is meant that the inert gas is not allowed to flow over the surface of the catalyst precursor.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the inert atmosphere not flow over the surface of the catalyst precursor.
      <br/>
      However, when the inert atmosphere does flow over the surface of the catalyst precursor, the flow rate can vary over a wide range , for example, at a space velocity from 1 to 500 hr-1.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The calcination is typically done at a temperature of from 350 (degree)  C. to 850 (degree)  C., preferably from 400 (degree)  C. to 700 (degree)  C., more preferably from 500 (degree)  C. to 640 (degree)  C. The calcination is typically performed for an amount of time suitable to form the catalyst.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the calcination is performed from 0.5 to 30 hours, preferably from 1 to 25 hours and more preferably from 1 to 15 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      With calcination a catalyst is formed having the formula

    <p num="27">
      The molar ratio, o i.e., the amount of oxygen (O) present, is dependent on the oxidation state of the other elements in the catalyst.
      <br/>
      However, typically o is from 3 to 4.7, based on the other elements present in the catalyst.

    <p num="28">
      Another aspect of the present invention is a catalyst for manufacturing an unsaturated aldehyde or a carboxylic acid from an alkane prepared by the process of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The catalyst is prepared as described above.
      <br/>
      The catalyst may be used as a solid catalyst alone or may be utilized with a suitable support such as, without limitation, silica, alumina, titania, aluminosilicate, diatomaceous earth, or zirconia.
      <br/>
      The shape of the catalyst can be any suitable shape and will depend upon the particular application of the catalyst.

      Generally, the alkane is a C3 -C8 alkane, preferably propane, isobutane or n-butane, more preferably propane or isobutane, most preferably propane.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, in another embodiment the alkane may be a mixture of alkanes including C3 -C8 alkanes as well as lower alkanes such as methane and ethane.

      <br/>
      The catalyst may be in a fluidized bed or a fixed bed reactor.
      <br/>
      The reaction is generally conducted under atmospheric pressure, but may be conducted under elevated or reduced pressure.

      The following examples illustrate the process of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Based on the amount of starting material used, if there was no compositional segregation, or there was no loss of certain elements during the preparation steps, all of the catalyst samples prepared as follows should have an empirical formula of Mo1 V0.3 Te0.23 Nb0.10-0.12 On where n is determined by the oxidation state of the other elements.
      <br/>
      The solutions or slurries containing the desired metal elements were prepared by heating the appropriate compounds in water at a temperature ranging from 25 (degree)  C. to 95 (degree)  C. When necessary, the solutions or slurries were cooled to temperatures ranging from 25 (degree)  C. to 60 (degree)  C. The water was then removed from the solutions or slurries by the appropriate drying method at pressures ranging from 760 mm/Hg to 10 mm/Hg.

    <p num="40">Catalyst Precursor Solution Dried By Rotary Evaporation And Calcined Under Argon, Non-Flow Atmosphere.</p>
    <p num="41">
      In a flask containing 420 g of water, 25.7 g of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (Aldrich Chemical Company), 5.1 g of ammonium metavanadate (Aldrich Chemical Company) and 7.7 g of telluric acid (Aldrich Chemical Company) were dissolved upon heating to 80 (degree)  C. After cooling to 39 (degree)  C., 114.6 g of an aqueous solution of niobium oxalate (Reference Metals Company) containing 17.34 mmole of niobium was mixed to obtain a solution.
      <br/>
      The water of this solution was removed via a rotary evaporator with a warm water bath at 50 (degree)  C. and 28 mm/Hg to obtain 44 g of precursor solid.
      <br/>
      Twenty g of the catalyst precursor solid was calcined in a covered crucible pre-purged with argon, non-flow environment at 600 (degree)  C. for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      The oven had previously been heated to 200 (degree)  C. and held for one hour, then ramped to 600 (degree)  C. During the calcination, the covered crucible was in a covered beaker with an Ar space velocity of 57 hr-1.
      <br/>
      Because of the covered crucible, the argon did not flow over the precursor surface, but rather served to insure that the atmosphere outside the crucible remained argon.
      <br/>
      The atmosphere inside the crucible remained argon and off gasses from the catalyst.
      <br/>
      The catalyst thus obtained was pressed in a mold and then broken and sieved to 10-20 mesh granules.
      <br/>
      Ten g of the granules were packed into a 1.1 cm inside diameter stainless steel U-tube reactor for gas phase propane oxidation.
      <br/>
      The oxidation was conducted with a reactor bath (molten salt) temperature of 390 (degree)  C., a feed ratio of propane/air/steam of 1/15/14, and a space velocity of 1,200 hr-1.
      <br/>
      The effluent from the reactor was condensed to separate the liquid phase (the condensable material) and the gas phase.
      <br/>
      The gas phase was analyzed by gas chromatography ("GC") to determine the propane conversion.
      <br/>
      The liquid phase was also analyzed by GC for the yield of acrylic acid.
      <br/>
      The results are shown in Table 1.
      <br/>
      The catalyst was also analyzed by x-ray diffraction to determine its crystalline structure.

      The results are shown in Table 5.

      The data in Table 1 above indicate that a prepared catalyst is much more effective at converting propane to acrylic acid when calcined under an inert, non-flow atmosphere than when calcined under air (see Examples 1 and 3).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the data indicate that a prepared catalyst is more effective at converting propane to acrylic acid when the catalyst is formed from a solution rather than a slurry (see Examples 1 and 5).
      <br/>
      The data of Table 1 also indicate that a prepared catalyst is more effective at converting propane to acrylic acid when the catalyst is calcined under a non-flow atmosphere rather than a flow atmosphere (see Examples 10 and 11).
      <br/>
      Finally, the data in Table 1 indicate that a prepared catalyst is more effective at converting propane to acrylic acid when the catalyst is initially dried by rotary evaporation rather than freeze drying (see Examples 5 and 7).

      The data in Table 2 show the loss of from 23 to 25 weight percent of the Te in the catalyst after calcination in a flow environment (see Examples 6 and 11), whereas in a non-flow environment (Examples 5 and 10) the weight percent of Te is comparable to the calculated theoretical value.
      <br/>
      This indicates that the catalyst is better formed in a non-flow environment.
      <br/>
      Particularly, loss of Te from the catalyst is shown when a flow environment is utilized during calcination.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is postulated that loss of substituent metal results in the lower yields shown in Table 1 for catalysts calcined in a flowing environment.

      The data in Table 3 demonstrate that the elements are not equally distributed between the aqueous phase and the solid phase of the slurry when the catalyst is prepared from a slurry.

      This results in the final catalyst having a compositional phase-segregation, therefore a less effective catalyst.
