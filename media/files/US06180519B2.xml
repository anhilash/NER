      A gate electrode is made up of a polycrystalline silicon film containing phosphorous as a dopant for determining its conductivity type, a titanium silicide film of the C54 structure, and a tungsten silicide film all of which films are laid one on another in said order.
      <br/>
      A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention involves sequentially forming a non-single-crystal silicon film containing a dopant for determining a conductivity type of the non-single-crystal silicon film, a titanium film, and a metal silicide film on a substrate.
      <br/>
      A titanium silicide film of a C49 and/or C54 structure is formed by performing a heat treatment so as to cause the titanium film to react with the non-single-crystal silicon film while reducing a first native oxide film formed in a first interface between the titanium film and the non-single-silicon film and a second native oxide film formed in a second interface between the titanium film and the metal silicide film.

      FIG. 17 is a cross sectional view showing the construction of a first conventional semiconductor device, which is an NMOS transistor.
      <br/>
      In the drawing, reference numeral 1 denotes a semiconductor substrate; 2, a device isolation oxide film formed on the semiconductor substrate 1; 3, source/drain regions formed in an active region surrounded by the device isolation oxide film 2 of the semiconductor substrate 1; 4, a gate oxide film formed on the semiconductor substrate 1; and 5, a gate electrode formed on the gate oxide film 4.
      <br/>
      The gate electrode 5 is made up of a polycrystalline silicon film 6 doped with a dopant, e.g., phosphorous, for determining its conductivity type, a titanium silicide film 7, and a tungsten silicide film which are stacked in the above order.

    <p num="6">
      A method of manufacturing the NMOS transistor of the first prior art having the above-described construction will now be described in conjunction with FIGS. 18A and 18B.
      <br/>
      To begin with, the device isolation oxide film 2 is formed on the semiconductor substrate 1 by the LOCOS method.
      <br/>
      Next, the gate oxide film 4 having a thickness of 60  Angstrom  is formed by oxidizing the top surface of the semiconductor substrate 1 by, for example, thermal oxidation.
      <br/>
      Then, a polycrystalline silicon film 6 that is doped with phosphorous at a dose of 5 * 1020 /cm2 as a dopant for determining its conductivity type is formed at a thickness of, for example, 800  Angstrom  by CVD.
      <br/>
      A titanium silicide film 7 is then formed on the polycrystalline film 6 at a thickness of, for example, 150  Angstrom  by sputtering.
      <br/>
      This is followed by formation of a tungsten silicide film 8 at a thickness of, for example, 800  Angstrom  by sputtering (FIG. 18A).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Thereafter, the gate electrode 5 is formed by etching a desired area of the tungsten silicide film 8, the titanium silicide film 7, and the polycrystalline silicon film 6 by use of a photolithography technique (FIG. 18B).
      <br/>
      LDD layers are then formed by implanting, e.g., arsenic ions into the semiconductor substrate 1 being tilted at an angle of, e.g., about 40 (degree)  under the conditions of, e.g., 30 keV and 40 * 1013 /cm2.
      <br/>
      Side-wall oxide films 9 are formed by depositing a silicon oxide film at a thickness of 800  Angstrom  by, e.g., CVD, and etching back the thus-formed silicon oxide film.
      <br/>
      The source/drain regions 3 are formed by implanting, e.g., arsenic ions, into the semiconductor substrate 1 under the conditions of 50 kev and 40 * 1015 /cm2.
      <br/>
      An NMOS transistor is completed by subjecting the substrate to a heat treatment of, e.g., 800 (degree)  C. and 60 minutes (FIG. 17).

      The N well 25 is formed by forming an opening in a resist film only in the PMOS formation region I using photolithography, and implanting, e.g., phosphorous ions, through the opening while changing the implantation energy.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the gate oxide film 4 is formed at a thickness of 60  Angstrom  by oxidizing the top surface of the semiconductor substrate 1 by, e.g., thermal oxidation.
      <br/>
      A polycrystalline silicon film having a thickness of 800  Angstrom  is then formed on the gate oxide film 4 by using, e.g., CVD. The N-type polycrystalline silicon film 29 is formed by forming an opening in a resist film only above the P well 24 using photolithography, and implanting, e.g., arsenic ions into the polycrystalline silicon film under the conditions of 50 keV and 4 * 1015 /cm2.
      <br/>
      The P-type polycrystalline silicon film 31 is formed by forming an opening in a resist film only above the N well 25 using photolithography, and implanting, e.g., boron ions into the polycrystalline silicon film under the conditions of 10 keV and 4 * 1015 /cm2 (FIG. 22A).

    <p num="16">
      A titanium silicide film 7 having a thickness of, e.g., 150  Angstrom  is formed by sputtering.
      <br/>
      A tungsten silicide film 8 having a thickness of, for example, 800  Angstrom  is also formed by sputtering (FIG. 22B).
      <br/>
      The NMOS and PMOS gate electrodes 28 and 30 are formed by respectively etching prescribed portions of the N-type and P-type polycrystalline silicon films 29 and 31, the titanium silicide film 7, and the tungsten silicide film 8 by photolithography (FIG. 22C).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      LDD layers are then formed by implanting, e.g., arsenic ions into the P well 24 in the NMOS formation region I under the conditions of 30 keV and 4 * 1013 /cm2 while tilting the semiconductor substrate 1 at 40 (degree) . The side-wall oxide films 9 are formed by depositing a silicon oxide film at a thickness of 800  Angstrom , by, e.g., CVD, and etching back the silicon oxide film.
      <br/>
      The N-type source/drain regions 26 are then formed by forming an opening in a resist film only in the NMOS formation region I using photolithography, and implanting, e.g., arsenic ions through the opening under the conditions of 50 keV and 4 * 1015 /cm2.

      The P-type source/drain regions 27 are formed by forming an opening in a resist film only in the PMOS formation region II using photolithography, and implanting, e.g., boron ions into through opening under the conditions of 10 keV and 4  * 1015 /cm2.
      <br/>
      A dual gate CMOS is completed by subjecting the substrate to a heat treatment of, e.g., 800 (degree)  C. and 60 minutes (FIG. 21).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Because the semiconductor devices of the prior art have the above described constructions, they have various problems described below.
      <br/>
      To begin with, the dopants for determining the conductivity type contained in the polycrystalline silicon films 6, 15, 29 and 31 are diffused into the titanium silicide films 7 and 16 and the tungsten silicide films 8 and 17 which are formed on the polycrystalline silicon films as a result of a variety of heating processes carried out after the titanium silicide films 7 and 16 and the tungsten silicide films 8 and 17 have been formed.
      <br/>
      Eventually, the concentrations of the dopants in the polycrystalline silicon films 6, 15, 29 and 31 become low.
      <br/>
      As a result of this phenomenon, a depletion layer is formed across each of the interfaces between the respective gate electrodes 5, 28 and 30 and the gate oxide film 4, whereby the gate capacitance is increased, which in turn results in decreased current drive capability of the device and an increased threshold voltage.
      <br/>
      Further, the previously mentioned phenomenon results in an increased resistance of the bit line 14 and prolonged read time.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the case of the dual gate CMOS, because the NMOS formation region I and the PMOS formation region II are formed as shown in FIG. 23, the previously mentioned phenomenon causes the N-type and P-type dopants, which have entered the titanium silicide film 7 and the tungsten silicide film 8 as a result of heat treatments carried out after the formation of these films, to mix with each other by diffusing.
      <br/>
      As a result, if a distance "d" between the NMOS formation region I and the PMOS formation region II is smaller than a desired value, the work functions of the gate electrodes 28 and 30 are changed to vary the PMOS and NMOS characteristics.
      <br/>
      To prevent such variations in the characteristics, the distance "d" should be made large.
      <br/>
      Further, it is necessary to prevent the NMOS and PMOS characteristics from varying even if the mutual diffusion of the dopants arise.
      <br/>
      However, a large distance between the two formation regions obstructs miniaturization of the device.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A native oxide film (not shown) of a few angstrom exists on the top surface of each of the polycrystalline silicon films 6, 15, 29 and 31.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the contact resistances between the titanium silicide films 7 and 16 and tungsten silicide films 8 and 17 and the polycrystalline silicon films 6, 15, 2 and 31 are increased.
      <br/>
      The increased contact resistance brings about an increase in the resistance value of each of the gate electrodes 5, 28 and 30, which in turn results in a drop of an applied voltage.
      <br/>
      The drop of the applied voltage leads to a decrease in current drive capability of the transistor.
      <br/>
      As for the bit line 14, an increased resistance prolongs the read time.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">
      The present invention has been conceived to solve the above described problems, and has an object of providing a semiconductor device which can improve the device characteristics by controlling the diffusion of a dopant for determining the conductivity type of a non-single-crystal silicon film.
      <br/>
      The invention is also intended to provide a manufacturing method of such a semiconductor device.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A semiconductor device, according to a first aspect of the present invention, has a wiring layer comprised of a non-single-crystal silicon film containing a dopant for determining its conductivity type, a titanium silicide film of the C49 and/or C54 structure, and a metal silicide film all of which films are laid one on another in this order.
      <br/>
      With this configuration, the titanium silicide film of the C49 and/or C54 structure prevents the dopant in the non-single-crystal silicon film from diffusing into the metal silicide film.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an increase in the resistance of the non-single-crystal silicon film resulting from a drop in the dopant concentration of the non-single-crystal silicon film is suppressed, which enables provision of a semiconductor device with a wiring layer having a desired resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A semiconductor device, according to a second aspect of the present invention, has a wiring layer comprised of a non-single-crystal silicon film containing a dopant for determining its conductivity type, a titanium silicide film of the C49 and/or C54 structure, a titanium nitride film, and a metal silicide film all of which are laid one on another in this order.
      <br/>
      With this configuration, not only the titanium silicide film having the C49 and/or C54 structure but also the titanium nitride film prevents the dopant in the non-single-crystal silicon film from diffusing into the metal silicide film.
      <br/>
      As a result, an increase in the resistance of the non-single-crystal silicon film resulting from a drop in the dopant concentration of the non-single-crystal silicon-film is further suppressed, which more positively enables provision of a semiconductor device with a wiring layer having a desired resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      A semiconductor device according to a third aspect of the present invention is characterized in that the wiring layer of the first or second aspect constitutes a gate electrode or a bit line.
      <br/>
      With this configuration, formation of a depletion layer in the gate electrode is suppressed, or an increase in the resistance of the bit line is suppressed.
      <br/>
      As a result, it becomes possible to provide a semiconductor device having improved device characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, a dual gate CMOS semiconductor device comprises, as gate electrodes, the wiring layers of the first or second aspect which respectively contain a first dopant for determining a first conductivity type and a second dopant for determining a second conductivity type in different non-single-crystal silicon films.
      <br/>
      With this configuration, the titanium silicide film of the C49 and/or C54 structure and/or the titanium nitride film prevents the dopant in the first or second conductivity type non-single-crystal silicon film from diffusing into the metal silicide film.
      <br/>
      Hence, an increase in the resistance of the non-single-crystal silicon-film resulting from a drop in the dopant concentration in the non-single-crystal silicon film is suppressed, which enables provision of a gate electrode having a desired resistance.
      <br/>
      Further, as a result of this, the dopants for the first and second conductivity types are prevented from diffusing to mix each other, which allows the distance between the gate electrodes of the first and second conductivity types to be made small, and thereby enables provision of a miniaturized semiconductor device.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      A semiconductor device of a fifth aspect is similar to the semiconductor device of any one of the first through fourth aspects, but the non-single-crystal silicon film further contains nitrogen.
      <br/>
      With this configuration, diffusion of the dopant in the non-single-crystal silicon film into the metal silicide film is prevented by not only the titanium silicide film of the C49 and/or C54 structure and the titanium nitride film, but also nitrogen.
      <br/>
      As a result, an increase in the resistance of the non-single-crystal silicon film resulting from a drop in the dopant concentration of the non-single-crystal silicon film is further suppressed, which more positively enables provision of a semiconductor device with a wiring layer having a desired resistance.

    <p num="27">
      A semiconductor device of a sixth aspect is similar to the semiconductor device of any one of the first through fifth aspects, but the titanium silicide film of the C49 and/or C54 structure is formed at a thickness of not less than 20  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      With this configuration, the titanium silicide film of the C49 and/or C54 structure having a thickness of not less than 20  Angstrom  positively prevents the dopant in a non-single-crystal silicon film from diffusing into the metal silicide film.
      <br/>
      As a result, an increase in the resistance of the non-single-crystal silicon film resulting from a drop in the dopant concentration of the non-single-crystal silicon film is further suppressed, which ensures provision of a semiconductor device with a wiring layer having a desired resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device comprises the steps of sequentially forming a non-single-crystal silicon film containing a dopant for determining its conductivity type, a titanium film, and a metal silicide film on a substrate; and forming a titanium silicide film of the C49 and/or C54 structure by reacting the titanium film with the non-single-crystal silicon film using a heat treatment.
      <br/>
      With the above manufacturing method, the titanium silicide film of the C49 and/or C54 structure prevents the dopant in the non-single-crystal silicon film from diffusing into the metal silicide film.

      As a result, it becomes possible to suppress an increase in the resistance of the non-single-crystal silicon film resulting from a drop in the dopant concentration of the non-single-crystal silicon film.
      <br/>
      Further, a native oxide film on the non-single-crystal silicon film is eliminated being reduced by titanium of the titanium film, as a result of which it becomes possible to suppress an increase in resistance due to the native oxide film.

      According to an eighth aspect of the present invention, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device comprises the steps of sequentially forming a non-single-crystal silicon film containing a dopant for determining its conductivity type, a titanium film, a titanium nitride film, and a metal silicide film on a substrate; and forming a titanium silicide film of the C49 and/or C54 structure by reacting the titanium film with the non-single-crystal silicon film using a heat treatment.

      According to a ninth aspect of the present invention, a method of manufacturing a dual gate CMOS semiconductor device comprises the steps of forming a non-single-crystal silicon film on a semiconductor substrate; implanting a dopant for determining a first conductivity type and a dopant for determining a second conductivity type into different regions of the non-single-crystal silicon film; sequentially forming a titanium film, a metal silicide film, or a titanium film, a titanium nitride film, and a metal silicide film on the non-single-crystal silicon film; forming a titanium silicide film of the C49 and/or C54 structure by reacting the titanium film with the non-single-crystal silicon film using a heat treatment; patterning a multiple layer of the non-single-crystal silicon film, the titanium silicide film, and the metal silicide film, or a multiple layer of the non-single-crystal silicon film, the titanium silicide film, the titanium nitride film, and the metal silicide film, thereby forming gate electrodes respectively having the first and second conductivity types.
      <br/>
      With this manufacturing method, the titanium silicide film of the C49 and/or C54 structure and/or the titanium nitride film prevents diffusion of the dopants in the first and second conductivity type non-single-crystal silicon films from diffusing into the metal silicide film.
      <br/>
      For this reason, an increase in the resistance of the non-single-crystal silicon film resulting from a drop in the dopant concentrations of the non-single-crystal silicon-film is suppressed, and it becomes possible to provide gate electrodes having a desired resistance.
      <br/>
      Further, as a result of this, the dopants for the first and second conductivity types dopants are prevented from diffusing to mix each other, which allows the distance between the gate electrodes of the first and second conductivity types to be made smaller and, eventually, allows miniaturization of a semiconductor device.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a native oxide film on the non-single-crystal silicon film is eliminated being reduced by titanium of the titanium film, as a result of which it becomes possible to suppress an increase in resistance due to the native oxide film.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="37">Embodiment 1</p>
    <p num="38">
      A first embodiment of the present invention will be explained below with reference to the accompanying drawings.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a cross sectional view showing the construction of a semiconductor, i.e., an NMOS transistor, according to the first embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      In the drawing, the same reference numerals are given to the corresponding elements of the previously mentioned conventional semiconductor devices, and the explanation thereof will be omitted here for brevity.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 48 denotes a titanium silicide film of the C54 structure which is formed between a polycrystalline silicon film 6 and a tungsten silicide film 8, and numeral 32 denotes a gate electrode comprising the polycrystalline silicon film 6, the titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure, and the tungsten silicide film 8 which are stacked in the above order.
      <br/>
      The titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure has a face-centered rhombic crystal structure, in which the crystal constants are a=0.824 nm, b=0.478 nm, and c=0.854 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Now, a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device of the first embodiment having the above-described construction will be described in conjunction with FIGS. 2A-2C. First, like the conventional semiconductor devices, a device isolation oxide film 2 is formed on a semiconductor substrate 1 by the LOCOS method.
      <br/>
      A gate oxide film 4 is then formed at a thickness of 60  Angstrom  by oxidizing the top surface of the semiconductor substrate 1 by, e.g., thermal oxidation.
      <br/>
      A polycrystalline silicon film 6 doped with a dopant for determining its conductivity type, e.g., phosphorous, at a dose of 5 * 1020 /cm2 is formed on the gate oxide film 4 at a thickness of, e.g., 800  Angstrom  by, for instance, CVD.
      <br/>
      A titanium film 33 is then formed on the polycrystalline silicon film 6 at a thickness of, for example, 50  Angstrom  by sputtering.
      <br/>
      A tungsten silicide film 8 is then formed on the titanium film 33 at a thickness of, for example, 800  Angstrom  by sputtering (FIG. 2A).
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      A heat treatment of RTA (rapid thermal annealing) is then carried out for 30 seconds at 700 (degree)  C. to react the titanium film 33 with the polycrystalline silicon film 6, so that a titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure is formed (FIG. 2B).
      <br/>
      At this time, a native oxide film of a few angstrom which exists on the polycrystalline silicon film 6 turns into TiO (titanium oxide) as a result of reducing action of titanium of the titanium film 33, and is discharged into the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The gate electrode 32 is formed by etching prescribed portions of the tungsten silicide film 8, the titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure, and the polycrystalline silicon film 6 using photolithography (FIG. 2C).
      <br/>
      Arsenic ions, for example, are then implanted into the semiconductor substrate 1 under the conditions of 30 keV and 40 * 1013 /cm2 while the semiconductor substrate 1 is tilted at, for example, 40 (degree) , to form LDD layers.
      <br/>
      A silicon oxide film is deposited at a thickness of 800  Angstrom  by, e.g., CVD, and the side-wall oxide films 9 are formed by etching back the thus-deposited silicon oxide film.
      <br/>
      Source/drain regions 3 are formed by implanting, e.g., arsenic ions, into the semiconductor substrate 1 under the conditions of 50 keV and 40 * 1015 /cm2.
      <br/>
      An NMOS transistor is completed by subjecting the semiconductor substrate to a heat treatment of, e.g., 800 (degree)  C. and 60 minutes (FIG. 1).
    </p>
    <p num="42">During this heating treatment or various heat treatments which will be commonly performed in later processes, the titanium silicide film 48 does not lose its C54 structure.</p>
    <p num="43">
      This will be explained with reference to FIG. 13. FIG. 13 is a graph showing sheet resistances of titanium silicide films obtained by subjecting titanium silicide films of the C54 structure to heat treatments of different temperatures.
      <br/>
      As is evident from the drawing, the sheet resistance of the titanium silicide film increases steeply as the heat treatment temperature increases from 850 (degree)  C. This is considered due to a phenomenon that the titanium silicide film loses its C54 structure and starts to coagulate as a result of phase change.
      <br/>
      In neither the above-mentioned heating process of about 800 (degree)  C. and 60 minutes nor various heat treatments commonly performed in later processes (where in general the temperature does not exceed 850 (degree)  C.), the titanium silicide film will not lose its C54 structure.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The semiconductor device of the first embodiment constructed in the above way has the titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure that is formed between the polycrystalline silicon film 6 and the tungsten silicide film 8.
      <br/>
      With this construction, the titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure prevents the dopant for determining the conductivity type, e.g., phosphorous, included in the polycrystalline silicon film 6 from diffusing into the tungsten silicide film 8.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      A titanium silicide film of the prior art formed by sputtering does not possess the C49 or C54 structure even if heated in a later process, and has particle sizes approximately in a range of 0.02-0.05  MU m. In contrast, the particle size of the titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure is as large as about 2.0-3.0  MU m, so it has a high density.
      <br/>
      Thus, the titanium silicide film 48 can prevent the diffusion of the dopant for determining the conductivity type, e.g., phosphorous.
    </p>
    <p num="46">The prevention of the diffusion of, e.g., phosphorous by the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure will be explained with reference to FIGS. 14 and 15. In FIG. 14, two N+ regions are formed adjacent to a P+ region, and the two N+ regions are connected to each other by a wiring line (gate electrode) I. The distance from source/drain regions (S/D) formed in the P+ region to the N+ region is represented by "d."</p>
    <p num="47">
      FIG. 15 shows a relationship between the threshold voltage Vth of the transistor in the P+ region and the distance "d" shown in FIG. 14 for respective cases where the wiring line I is a double layer of tungsten silicide and polycrystalline silicon, and where it is a triple layer of tungsten silicide, titanium silicide of the C54 structure, and polycrystalline silicon.
      <br/>
      The term TiSi2 appearing in FIG. 15 means a titanium silicide film having the C49 or C54 structure, or made of a mixed crystal of the C49 and C54 structure.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      As is evident from FIG. 15, if the distance "d" decreases from 100  MU m, the threshold voltage Vth of the transistor with the tungsten silicide film and the polycrystalline silicon film increases.
      <br/>
      This is because the dopants for determining the conductivity type included in the polycrystalline silicon film enter the tungsten silicide film and diffuse therein, so that the dopants for the different conductivity types compensate each other in the N+ and P+ regions, which results in reduced effective concentrations and changes of the work functions.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      On the other hand, in the device of the present invention provided with the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure, the threshold voltage Vth remains unchanged even if the distance "d" is small.
      <br/>
      This is attributable to the fact that the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure prevents the dopants for determining the conductivity type included in the polycrystalline silicon film from entering the tungsten silicide film.
      <br/>
      In view of the above, it is evident that the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure prevents diffusion of the dopant for determining the conductivity type.
    </p>
    <p num="50">Thus, the invention suppresses formation of a depletion layer across the interface between the gate electrode 32 and the gate oxide film 4, realizing a semiconductor device, i.e., an NMOS transistor, having high drive capability.</p>
    <p num="51">
      This will be further explained with reference to FIG. 16. As shown in the drawing, in the device that is not provided with the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure, the dopant for determining the conductivity type diffuse into the tungsten silicide film.
      <br/>
      Hence, a depletion layer extends into the gate electrode, as a result of which the gate capacitance in the inversion range is smaller than that of in the accumulation range.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the device having the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure, the dopant for determining the conductivity type is prevented from diffusing into the tungsten silicide film, so that the gate capacitance in the inversion range is the same as that in the accumulation range.
      <br/>
      The term TiSi2 in FIG. 16 means a titanium silicide film having the C49 or C54 structure, or made of a mixed crystal of the C54 and C49 structures.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Further, because a native oxide film existing on the top surface of the polycrystalline silicon film 6 is eliminated being reduced by titanium of the titanium film 33, which has strong reducing action, when the titanium film 33 reacts with the polycrystalline silicon film 6.
      <br/>
      As a result, the native oxide film having high resistance disappears, enabling formation of a low-resistance gate electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The resistivity of the titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure is about 15-30  MU  OMEGA  * cm, which is smaller than about 25  OMEGA  * cm of the titanium silicide film not having the C54 or C49 structure formed by the conventional sputtering method.
      <br/>
      This allows the gate electrode 32 to have a further lower resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="54">FIGS. 15 and 16 do not show results of a device having the titanium silicide film formed between the tungsten silicide film and the polycrystalline silicon film by sputtering, but this case exhibits the same results as the case of the device having the double layer consisting of the tungsten silicide film and the polycrystalline silicon film.</p>

      Next, a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device of the second embodiment having the above-described construction will be explained in conjunction with FIGS. 4A-4C. A device isolation oxide film 2 is formed on a semiconductor substrate 1 by the LOCOS method in the same manner as in the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      A gate oxide film 4 is then formed at a thickness of 60  Angstrom  by oxidizing the top surface of the semiconductor substrate 1 by thermal oxidation.

A titanium film 33 having a thickness of, for example, 50  Angstrom  is then formed on the polycrystalline silicon film 6 by sputtering.

      Subsequently, a titanium nitride film 34 having a thickness of, for example, 100  Angstrom  and a tungsten silicide film 8 having a thickness of, for example, 800  Angstrom , are formed in this order also by sputtering (FIG. 4A).
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The substrate is then subjected to a heat treatment of RTA for 30 seconds at a temperature of 70020  C. to react the titanium film 33 with the polycrystalline silicon film 6, whereby a titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure is formed (FIG. 4B).
      <br/>
      At this time, a native oxide film of a few angstrom that exists on the polycrystalline silicon film 6 turns into TiO (titanium oxide) as a result of reducing action of titanium of the titanium film 33, and the reduced substance is discharged into the atmosphere.

    <p num="59">
      The gate electrode 35 is formed by etching prescribed portions of the tungsten silicide film 8, the titanium nitride film 34, the titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure, and the polycrystalline silicon film 6 using photolithography (FIG. 4C).
      <br/>
      Arsenic ions, for example, are then implanted into the semiconductor substrate 1 under the conditions of, e.g., 30 keV and 40 * 1013 /cm2 while the semiconductor substrate 1 is tilted at, for example, 40 (degree)  C., to form LDD layers.
      <br/>
      A silicon oxide film is deposited at a thickness of 800  Angstrom  by, e.g., CVD, and side-wall oxide films 9 are formed by etching back the thus-deposited silicon oxide film.

      Source/drain regions 3 are formed by implanting, e.g., arsenic ions into the semiconductor substrate 1 under the conditions of 50 keV and 40 * 1015 /cm2.
      <br/>
      An NMOS transistor is completed by subjecting the semiconductor substrate to a heat treatment of, e.g., 800 (degree)  C. and 60 minutes (FIG. 3).

      The semiconductor device of the second embodiment constructed as described above has the titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure that is formed between the polycrystalline silicon film 6 and the tungsten silicide film 8 in the same manner as in the first embodiment, so that naturally similar advantages to those of the first embodiment are obtained.
      <br/>
      Further, the titanium nitride film 34, which is formed between the titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure and the tungsten silicide film 8, prevents more effectively the dopant for determining the conductivity type, e.g., phosphorous, contained in the polycrystalline silicon film 6 from diffusing into the tungsten silicide film 8.

      Hence, for the same reasons as described in the above embodiments, the diffusion of, for example, phosphorous and arsenic, as the dopants for determining the conductivity types contained in the respective polycrystalline silicon films 29 and 31 into the tungsten silicide film 8 is prevented by the titanium silicide film 41 of the C54 structure.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it goes without saying that similar advantages to those of the above embodiments are achieved.
      <br/>
      Further, the P-type and N-type dopants are prevented from diffusing to mix each other, so that the work functions of the gate electrode 42 and 43 do not vary.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the distance "d" between the NMOS formation region I and the PMOS formation region II, as shown in FIG. 23 used above in describing the prior art, can be made smaller, which enables manufacture of a miniaturized dual gate CMOS semiconductor device.

      In the fifth embodiment, the NMOS and PMOS gate electrodes 42 and 43 are formed by the N-type or P-type polycrystalline silicon films 29 and 31, the titanium silicide film 41 of the C54 structure, and the tungsten silicide film 8 which are stacked in the above order.
      <br/>
      However, if the NMOS and PMOS gate electrodes are formed by the N-type or P-type polycrystalline silicon film, the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure, a titanium nitride film, and the tungsten silicide film which are stacked in the above order, not only the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure but also the titanium nitride film prevents the dopants for determining conductivity types of the respective polycrystalline silicon films from diffusing into the tungsten silicide film.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the P-type and N-type dopants is more effectively prevented from diffusing to mix each other, and the work functions of the respective gate electrodes is certainly ensured to remain unchanged.
      <br/>
      For these reasons, the distance "d" between the NMOS formation region I and the PMOS formation region II can be made further smaller, which in turn obviously means that the device can be miniaturized to a larger extent.

      FIG. 11 is a cross sectional view showing the structure of a semiconductor device, i.e., an NMOS transistor, according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the drawing, parts that are the same as those in the first embodiment are assigned the same reference numerals, and the explanation thereof will be omitted.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 45 denotes a polycrystalline silicon film containing, for example, phosphorous and nitrogen as dopants for determining its conductivity type, and numeral 46 denotes a gate electrode comprising the polycrystalline silicon film 45, a titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure, and a tungsten silicide film 8 which are stacked in the above order.

    <p num="91">
      A method of manufacturing the semiconductor device (NMOS transistor) of the seventh embodiment having the above described construction will be described in conjunction with FIGS. 12A-12D. First, similarly to the first embodiment, a device isolation oxide film 2 is formed on a semiconductor substrate 1 by the LOCOS method.
      <br/>
      A gate oxide film 4 is then formed at a thickness of 60  Angstrom  by oxidizing the top surface of the semiconductor substrate 1 by thermal oxidation.
      <br/>
      By using CVD, a polycrystalline silicon film doped at 5 * 1020 /cm2 with phosphorous, for example, as a dopant for determining its conductivity type is deposited at a thickness of, for example, 800  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      A polycrystalline silicon film 45 containing phosphorous and nitrogen is formed by implanting nitrogen ions 47 into the polycrystalline silicon film under the conditions of, for example, 5 keV and 4 * 1015 /cm2 (FIG. 12A).
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      A titanium film 33 is then formed at a thickness of, for example, 50  Angstrom  by sputtering, followed by formation of a tungsten silicide film 8 at a thickness of, for example, 800  Angstrom  also by sputtering (FIG. 12B).
      <br/>
      The substrate is then subjected to a heat treatment of RTA for 30 seconds at a temperature of 700 (degree)  C. to form a titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure by reacting the titanium film 33 with the polycrystalline silicon film 45 (FIG. 12C).
      <br/>
      At this time, a native oxide film of a few angstrom that exists on the polycrystalline silicon layer 6 turns into TiO (titanium oxide) as a result of reducing action of titanium of the titanium film 33, and the thus-reduced substance is discharged into the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      The gate electrode 46 is then formed by etching prescribed portions of the tungsten silicide film 8, the titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure, and the polycrystalline silicon film 45 by using photolithography (FIG. 12D).
      <br/>
      LDD layers are formed by implanting arsenic ions, for example, into the semiconductor substrate 1 under the conditions of 30 keV and 4.0 * 1013 /cm2 while the semiconductor substrate 1 is tilted at, for example, 40 (degree) . A silicon oxide film is deposited at a thickness of 800  Angstrom  by, e.g., CVD, and side-wall oxide films 9 are formed by etching back the thus-deposited silicon oxide film.
      <br/>
      Arsenic ions, for instance, are the implanted into the semiconductor substrate 1 under the conditions of 50 kev and 4.0 * 1015 /cm21, whereby source/drain regions 3 are formed.
      <br/>
      An NMOS transistor is completed by subjecting the substrate to a heat treatment of, for instance, 800 (degree)  C. and 60 minutes (FIG. 11).
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      The semiconductor device of the seventh embodiment constructed as described above has the titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure that is formed between the polycrystalline silicon film 45 and the tungsten silicide film 8 as in the previous embodiments.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it goes without saying that similar advantages to those obtained in the above-described embodiments can be attained.
      <br/>
      The diffusion coefficient of nitrogen in the polycrystalline silicon film 45 is much different from that of phosphorous.
      <br/>
      For this reason, when both nitrogen and phosphorous diffuse at the same time, their effective diffusion coefficients are reduced, so that the diffusion of phosphorous is suppressed.
      <br/>
      As a result, the formation of a depletion layer across the interface between the gate electrode 46 and the gate oxide film 4 is further suppressed, allowing production of an NMOS transistor having a higher drive capability.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Although in the seventh embodiment the explanation was given of the case where the dopant for determining the conductivity type of the polycrystalline silicon film 45 is phosphorous, the dopant is not limited to phosphorous.
      <br/>
      Even if boron, arsenic, etc. are used as the dopant for determining the conductivity type, since their diffusion coefficients are a little different from that of nitrogen, naturally the same advantages will be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      Although in seventh embodiment only the titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure is formed between the polycrystalline silicon film 45 and the tungsten silicide film 8, the invention is not limited to such a case.
      <br/>
      If a titanium nitride film is formed between the titanium silicide film 48 of the C54 structure and the tungsten silicide film 8 as in the above-described embodiments, the same advantages will naturally be realized.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      In the seventh embodiment, explanation was given of the NMOS transistor.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention is not limited to such a case.
      <br/>
      If the bit line or each of the polycrystalline silicon films of the dual gate CMOS device is provided with nitrogen as in the seventh embodiment, the diffusion of the dopant for determining the conductivity type of the polycrystalline silicon film will be suppressed by the introduction of nitrogen.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the case of the bit line, the resistance increase of the polycrystalline silicon film is further suppressed, which makes it is possible to reduce a delay in signal reading more effectively.
      <br/>
      Further, in the dual gate CMOS device, the N-type and P-type dopants are more effectively prevented from diffusing to mix each other, and the work functions of the NMOS and PMOS gate electrodes are ensured not to vary, which allows the device to be miniaturized to a greater extent.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Each of the above embodiments is directed to the case of forming the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure.
      <br/>
      As described previously, the particle size of the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure is as large as 2-3  MU m. It goes without saying that if the width of the wiring layer using the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure and the thickness of the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure are greater than this particle size, the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure can be formed more easily.
      <br/>
      Where the width of the wiring layer and the thickness of the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure are smaller than the above particle size, a titanium silicide film of the C49 structure and the titanium silicide film composed of a mixed crystal of the C54 and C49 structures are occasionally formed.
    </p>
    <p num="99">Embodiment 8</p>
    <p num="100">
      Although each of the above embodiments is directed to the case of using the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure, the invention is not limited to such a case, but the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure can also be used.
      <br/>
      Even if the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure is used, the same advantages as obtained in the previous embodiments will be ensured, because the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure provides similar results for the characteristics of FIGS. 13-16 which were described above in connection with the first embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      In the following, only the differences between the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure and the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure will be explained.
      <br/>
      The titanium silicide film of the C49 structure has a body-centered rhombic crystal structure in which the lattice coefficients are a=0.362 nm, b=1.376 nm, and c=0.361 nm. The particle size is approximately 1.0  MU m, and is slightly smaller than the that of the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure.
      <br/>
      However, with respect to the capability to prevent the diffusion of the dopant for determining the conductivity type, the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure is no different from the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure.
      <br/>
      The resistivity is as low as 100-200  MU  OMEGA  * cm.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      Further, as in the case of the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure, the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure is formed by reacting a titanium film with a polycrystalline silicon film by using RTA.
      <br/>
      However, to form the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure, RTA conditions of 500 (degree)  C. and 30 seconds are employed.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      If the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure is subjected to a heat treatment at more than 500 (degree)  C. in some of various later heat treatment steps, there may occur partial transition from the C49 structure to the C54 structure, in which case the titanium silicide film comes to be made of a mixed crystal of the C54 and C49 structures.
      <br/>
      Further, if the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure is subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature of 700 (degree)  C., the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure turns into the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure.
      <br/>
      However, the particle size of the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure is larger than that of the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure.
      <br/>
      Hence, in a wiring line smaller than the particle size of the C54 structure, the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure is less likely to turn into the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure, so that the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure remains intact.
    </p>
    <p num="104">Embodiment 9</p>
    <p num="105">
      Even if the titanium silicide film made of a mixed crystal of the C54 and C49 structures is used instead of the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure, the same advantages as obtained in the previous embodiments will be ensured, because the titanium silicide film made of a mixed crystal of the C54 and C49 structures provides similar results for the characteristics of FIGS. 13-16 which were described above in connection with the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      In the following, differences in the methods for forming the titanium silicide film made of a mixed crystal of the C49 and C54 structures, the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure, and the titanium silicide film of the C49 structure will be explained.
      <br/>
      To form the titanium silicide film made of a mixed crystal of the C54 and C49 structures, RTA is performed to react a titanium film with a polycrystalline silicon film as in case of forming the titanium silicide film of the C54 structure.
      <br/>
      However, RTA conditions of 500-700 (degree)  C. and 30 seconds are employed.

    <p num="106">Embodiment 10</p>
    <p num="107">
      The above embodiments are directed to the NMOS transistor, the bit line, and the dual gate CMOS device.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention is not limited to those cases, but, needless to say, can be applied to all of wiring layers including a polycrystalline silicon film containing a dopant for determining its conductivity type and a tungsten silicide film.

    <p num="108">Embodiment 11</p>
    <p num="109">Although in the above embodiments the polycrystalline silicon film is used as an example of the non-single-crystal silicon film, the invention is not limited to such a case, but, needless to say, an amorphous silicon film, for instance, can also be used.</p>

      In each of the above embodiments, the thickness of the titanium silicide film of the C49 or C54 structure has not been specifically described.

      If this film is formed at a thickness of not less than 20  Angstrom , the dopant diffusion can be prevented positively.
      <br/>
      To form the titanium silicide film of the C49 or C54 structure at a thickness of not less than 20  Angstrom , it is necessary to form a titanium film having a thickness of not less than 10  Angstrom  for reaction with a polycrystalline silicon film.
