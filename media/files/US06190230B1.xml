    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a walking and rocking toy device.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a walking and rocking toy device which can rock and walk forward.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      A conventional walking toy device has a very complex structure.
      <br/>
      It is not easy to assemble the conventional walking toy device.
      <br/>
      If an element is broken, the whole conventional walking toy device will become useless.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">An object of the present invention is to provide a walking and rocking toy device which can rock and walk forward.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Accordingly, a walking and rocking toy device comprises a base seat, a transmission mechanism, a hollow cylinder casing, and an annular cover.
      <br/>
      The hollow cylinder casing covers the base seat.
      <br/>
      The transmission mechanism is disposed between the base seat and the hollow cylinder casing.
      <br/>
      The hollow cylinder casing has a center portion, a plurality of arc holes, a plurality of protruded blocks, and an annular recess receiving the annular cover.
      <br/>
      A micromotion switch device is disposed on the center portion of the hollow cylinder casing.
      <br/>
      The base seat has three columns inserted in the arc holes of the hollow cylinder casing and two pairs of pillars.
      <br/>
      Each of the columns has a threaded hole.
      <br/>
      Each of the pillars has a threaded aperture.
      <br/>
      A cell box is disposed on the base seat.
      <br/>
      A cell box cover is disposed on a bottom of the base seat to cover the cell box.
      <br/>
      A contact starting switch is disposed on a lateral of the cell box.
      <br/>
      The transmission mechanism comprises a first gear casing, a second gear casing engaging with the first gear casing, a motor and a gear set disposed between the first gear casing and the second gear casing, and two movable devices fastened on the first gear casing and the second gear casing.
      <br/>
      Each of the first gear casing and the second gear casing has an upper post having an upper groove, an arc arm, and two positioning plates fastened on the pillars.
      <br/>
      The gear set has a first gear coaxial with a belt pulley, a second gear coaxial with a first clutch gear and a second clutch gear, a third gear, a fourth gear, and a fifth gear.
      <br/>
      A shaft of the motor passes through the first gear casing.
      <br/>
      A belt surrounds the belt pulley and the shaft of the motor.
      <br/>
      The first gear engages with the second gear.
      <br/>
      The second gear engages with the fourth gear and the fifth gear.
      <br/>
      The fourth gear engages with the fifth gear.
      <br/>
      The first gear drives the second gear.
      <br/>
      The second gear drives the third gear.
      <br/>
      The third gear drives the first clutch gear and the second clutch gear.
      <br/>
      A coiled spring is disposed on the second clutch gear.
      <br/>
      The second clutch gear dirves the fourth gear and the fifth gear alternatively.
      <br/>
      A first shaft passes through the fourth gear.
      <br/>
      Two distal portions of the first shaft are fixed on the first gear casing and the second gear casing.
      <br/>
      The fifth gear drives a crown gear.
      <br/>
      A rotating shaft passes through the fifth gear and an eccentric wheel.
      <br/>
      Each of the movable devices has a walking plate having an oblong aperture receiving a second shaft and a circular hole receiving an eccentric shaft.
      <br/>
      The eccentric shaft has a square aperture receiving the first shaft.
      <br/>
      The second shaft passes through the fifth gear.
      <br/>
      A rocking device has a rocking bar, the rotating shaft, and the eccentric wheel.
      <br/>
      The eccentric wheel is disposed on a top portion of the first gear casing and a top portion of the second gear casing.
      <br/>
      A protruded rod is disposed on the eccentric wheel.
      <br/>
      The rocking bar has a round hole, an oblong hole, and a through hole.
      <br/>
      The round hole of the rocking bar receives the upper post.
      <br/>
      The oblong hole of the rocking bar receives the protruded rod.
      <br/>
      A round rod is disposed in the hollow cylinder casing to be inserted in the through hole of the rocking bar.

      <br/>
      The eccentric shaft 232 drives the walking plate 231 to move.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Since the rotating speed of the second clutch gear 225 is faster than the rotating speed of the first clutch gear 224, the second clutch gear 225 will be disengaged from the first clutch gear 224 until the second clutch gear 225 engages with the fifth gear 227.
      <br/>
      The fifth gear 227 drives the crown gear 228 and the eccentric wheel 241 to vibrate the rocking bar 242.
