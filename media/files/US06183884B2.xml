      <br/>
      A metallic article includes a bond coating and a ceramic thermal barrier coating on the bond coating.
      <br/>
      The ceramic thermal barrier coating includes a plurality of columnar grains, which extend perpendicularly to the surface of the metallic article.
      <br/>
      Each columnar grain includes a plurality of layers.
      <br/>
      Some of the layers include sub-grains extending at an acute angle to the surface of the metallic article to form voids between adjacent sub-grains.
      <br/>
      The voids are arranged at an acute angle to the surface of the metallic article and reduce the thermal conductivity of the ceramic thermal barrier coating.
      <br/>
      Some of the layers include sub-grains extending perpendicularly to the surface of the metallic article to provide erosion resistance.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a thermal barrier coating applied to the surface of a superalloy article e.g. a gas turbine engine turbine blade, and to a method of applying the thermal barrier coating.
      <br/>
      The invention particularly relates to ceramic thermal barrier coatings.
    </p>
    <p num="2">The constant demand for increased operating temperature in gas turbine engines was initially met by air cooling of the turbine blades and turbine vanes and the development of superalloys from which to manufacture the turbine blades and turbine vanes, both of which extended their service lives.</p>
    <p num="3">Further temperature increases necessitated the development of ceramic coating materials with which to insulate the turbine blades and turbine vanes from the heat contained in the gases discharged from the combustion chambers, again the operating lives of the turbine blades and turbine vanes was extended.</p>

      The ceramic thermal barrier coatings deposited by the physical vapour deposition process have benefits over the ceramic thermal barrier coating deposited by plasma spraying.

      The main benefit is improved thermal shock resistance due to the columnar structure of the ceramic thermal barrier coating produced by the physical vapour deposition process.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="41">
      Referring to FIG. 1, illustrating the prior art, there is shown part of a superalloy article 10 provided with a multi-layer thermal barrier coating indicated generally by numeral 12.
      <br/>
      It is shown in the as manufactured condition.
      <br/>
      The thermal barrier coating 12 comprises a bond coating 14 on the superalloy substrate 10, an oxide layer 16 on the bond coating 14 and a ceramic thermal barrier coating 18 on the oxide layer 16.
      <br/>
      The bond coating 14 is generally an aluminium containing alloy for example a MCrAlY alloy where M is at least one of Ni, Co and Fe, a nickel aluminide, a cobalt aluminide or a platinum aluminide.
      <br/>
      The oxide layer generally comprises alumina together with other oxides.
    </p>
    <p num="42">The ceramic thermal barrier coating 18 comprises a plurality of columnar ceramic grains 20 which extend substantially perpendicularly to the surface of the superalloy substrate 10.</p>
    <p num="43">It has been found that the thermal conductivity of the prior art columnar ceramic thermal barrier coating 18 is greater than the thermal conductivity of prior art plasma sprayed ceramic thermal barrier coatings.</p>
    <p num="44">
      The multi-layer thermal barrier coating 12 is applied on the superalloy article 10 by firstly depositing a MCrAlY alloy bond coating 14 by plasma spraying or physical vapour deposition or forming a nickel aluminide bond coating 14 by diffusion aluminising or forming a platinum aluminide bond coating 14 by platinum modified diffusion aluminising.
      <br/>
      The ceramic thermal barrier coating 18 is then applied onto the bond coating 14 by physical vapour deposition, usually electron beam physical vapour deposition.
      <br/>
      The oxide layer 16 forms on the bond coating 14 while the superalloy article 10 is heated up to the operating temperature in an electron beam physical vapour deposition chamber due to the presence of oxygen.
      <br/>
      The superalloy article 10 is rotated in the electron beam physical vapour deposition chamber in the ceramic vapours to produce the ceramic thermal barrier coating 18.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Referring to FIG. 2, illustrating the present invention, there is shown part of a superalloy article 30 provided with a multi-layer thermal barrier coating indicated generally by numeral 32.
      <br/>
      It is shown in the as manufactured condition.
      <br/>
      The thermal barrier coating 32 comprises a bond coating 34 on the superalloy substrate 30, an oxide layer 36 on the bond coating 34 and a ceramic thermal barrier coating 38 on the oxide layer 36.
      <br/>
      The bond coating 34 is generally an aluminium containing alloy for example a MCrAlY alloy where M is at least one of Ni, Co and Fe, a nickel aluminide, a cobalt aluminide or a platinum aluminide.
      <br/>
      The oxide layer generally comprises alumina together with other oxides.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The ceramic thermal barrier coating 38 comprises a plurality of columnar ceramic grains 40 which extend substantially perpendicularly to the surface of the superalloy substrate 30.
      <br/>
      Furthermore it is seen that each columnar ceramic grain 40 comprises a plurality of layers 42 and 44.
      <br/>
      The sub grains 46 in the layers 42 extend substantially perpendicularly, at an angle alpha 1, to the surface of the superalloy substrate 30 and the sub-grains 48 in the layers 44 extend at an acute angle, alpha 2, to the surface of the superalloy substrate 30.
      <br/>
      Additionally voids 50, or pores, are formed between the adjacent sub-grains 48 in the layers 44, which are shown more clearly in FIG. 2A, and the voids 50 are arranged at the same acute angle, alpha 2, to the surface of the superalloy substrate.
      <br/>
      The differences in structure between the layers 42 and 44 produces interfaces which reduce the thermal conductivity of the ceramic thermal barrier coating 38.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the layers is selected to reduce either the phonon thermal conductivity or the photon thermal conductivity.
      <br/>
      Additionally the voids 50 between adjacent sub-grains 48 in the layers 44 reduce phonon thermal conductivity of the ceramic thermal barrier coating 18.
      <br/>
      The layers 42 and 44 are arranged alternately to provide good erosion resistance, with a thicker final layer 44.
    </p>
    <p num="47">It has been found that the thermal conductivity of the columnar ceramic thermal barrier coating 38 according to the present invention has lower thermal conductivity than a prior art columnar ceramic thermal barrier coating 18 in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="48">It is believed that the presence of the voids 50 between adjacent sub-grains 48 shortens the mean free path length of a phonon and hence reduces the phonon thermal conductivity of the columnar ceramic thermal barrier coating 38.</p>
    <p num="49">
      The multi-layer thermal barrier coating 32 is applied on the superalloy article 30 by firstly depositing a MCrAlY alloy bond coating 34 by plasma spraying or physical vapour deposition or forming a nickel aluminide bond coating 34 by diffusion aluminising or forming a platinum aluminide bond coating 34 by platinum modified diffusion aluminising.
      <br/>
      The ceramic thermal barrier coating 38 is then applied onto the bond coating 34 by physical vapour deposition, usually electron beam physical vapour deposition.
      <br/>
      The oxide layer 36 forms on the bond coating 34 while the superalloy article 30 is heated up to the operating temperature in an electron beam physical vapour deposition chamber due to the presence of oxygen.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The superalloy article 30 is rotated in the electron beam physical vapour deposition chamber in the ceramic vapours to produce the ceramic thermal barrier coating 38.
      <br/>
      The layers 42 are produced by depositing the ceramic while the surface of the superalloy article 30 is substantially perpendicular to the flux of the ceramic vapours from the source of ceramic.
      <br/>
      The layers 44 are produced by depositing the ceramic while the surface of the superalloy article 30 is at an acute angle to the flux of the ceramic vapours from the source of ceramic.
      <br/>
      Thus the superalloy article 30 is periodically tilted between two positions while it is being rotated in the electron beam physical vapour deposition chamber.
      <br/>
      The layers are preferably produced while the surface of the superalloy article 30 is at an angle between 10 (degree)  and 60 (degree) , more preferably between 20 (degree)  and 45 (degree) , preferably 30 (degree) , to the flux of the ceramic vapours from the source of ceramic.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The layers 42 may be necessary to provide erosion resistance to the columnar ceramic thermal barrier coating 38 if the angle of inclination, alpha 2, is relatively low.
      <br/>
      At low angles of inclination, alpha 2, the columnar ceramic thermal barrier coating has very poor erosion resistance as seen from FIG. 7, however at low angles of inclination, alpha 2, the thermal conductivity is relatively good as seen from FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      It may be possible to simply have layers 44 arranged alternately with different angles of inclination, alpha 2, to the surface of the metallic substrate 30 and/or the same angles of inclination, alpha 2, to the surface of the metallic substrate but in opposite directions if the angles of inclination, alpha 2, are not too low.

      Additionally voids 86, or pores, are formed between the adjacent sub-grains 84 in the layers 80.
      <br/>
      The differences in structure between the layers 78 and 80 produces interfaces which reduce the thermal conductivity of the ceramic thermal barrier coating 68.

      <br/>
      Additionally the voids 160 between adjacent sub-grains 158 in he layers 154 reduce phonon thermal conductivity of the ceramic thermal barrier coating 148.
      <br/>
      The adjacent layers 154 have sub-grains 158 arranged at different acute angles, and it is to be noted that there is a gradual change in the angles of the sub-grains 158 from a minimum acute angle to a layer 152 which has sub-grains 156 at 90 (degree)  and then a gradual change in the angles of the sub-grains 158 to a minimum acute angle.
    </p>
    <p num="63">Referring to FIG. 7 which shows the erosion rate of the ceramic thermal barrier coating against angle of inclination of sub-grains in a columnar ceramic grain it is seen that the erosion rate is least for sub-grains arranged perpendicularly to the surface of the superalloy article and the erosion rate progressively increases as the acute angle decreases.</p>
    <p num="64">Referring to FIG. 8 which shows thermal conductivity of the ceramic thermal barrier coating against angle of inclination of sub-grains in a columnar ceramic grain it is seen that the thermal conductivity is greatest for sub-grains arranged perpendicularly to the surface of the superalloy article and the thermal conductivity progressively decreases as the acute angle decreases.</p>
    <p num="65">
      Thus ideally the ceramic thermal barrier coating should have sub-grains arranged at very small acute angles to the surface of the metallic article to minimise the thermal conductivity.
      <br/>
      However, this would mean that the erosion resistance of the ceramic thermal barrier coating would be very poor.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in order to obtain a reduction in thermal conductivity without reducing erosion resistance it is preferred to have layers with sub-grains at small acute angles to the surface of the metallic article and layers with sub-grains perpendicular to the surface of the metallic article.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      It is preferred to use layers with sub-grains at an angle between 10 (degree)  and 60 (degree) , more preferably between 20 (degree)  and 45 (degree) , preferably 30 (degree) , to the surface of the metallic article and layers with sub-grains perpendicular to the surface of the metallic article.
      <br/>
      It is possible to have many different arrangements of the layers with the differently oriented sub-grains to obtain suitable erosion resistance and reduction in thermal conductivity.
    </p>
    <p num="67">It may be possible, in circumstances where erosion is not a problem, to have one or more layers with the sub-grains arranged at an acute angle to the surface of the metallic article.</p>

      In a series of experiments a thermal barrier coating was deposited onto samples of nickel alloy substrate.
      <br/>
      A MCrAlY bond coating was deposited onto samples of N75 nickel alloy substrate, an alumina layer was formed on the MCrAlY bond coating and a yttria stabilised zirconia ceramic thermal barrier coating was deposited onto the alumina layer by electron beam physical vapour deposition.
      <br/>
      The N75 nickel alloy comprises 19.5 wt % Cr, 0.4 wt % Ti, 0.1 wt % C balance Ni.

      In the second mode of operation 190 micrometers of ceramic was deposited while rotating the superalloy substrate at a constant rotational speed of 2.5 revolutions per minute while the surface of the superalloy substrate was moved constantly between an acute angle of +25 (degree)  to the flux of the ceramic vapours from the source of ceramic and an acute angle of -25 (degree)  to the flux of the ceramic vapours from the source of ceramic.
      <br/>
      The thermal conductivity of the ceramic thermal barrier coating was measured and it was 1.53 W/m/K.

    <p num="77">
      The total thickness of the yttria stabilised zirconia ceramic for the four examples was 254 micrometers.
      <br/>
      Thus the sub-grains in examples 1 to 4 are arranged at an angle between 0 and 25 (degree)  to the surface of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the layers varies with the speed of rotation of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The angles of the sub-grains in adjacent layers changes gradually from 25 (degree)  in one direction to 0 (degree)  and to 25 (degree)  in the other direction.
    </p>
    <p num="78">The thermal conductivity of 254 micrometers of yttria stabilised zirconia deposited by conventional electron beam physical vapour deposition is about 1.7 to 1.8 W/m/K. It can be seen that the coatings in Examples 1 to 4 have a reduction in thermal conductivity compared to that of yttria stabilised zirconia deposited by conventional electron beam physical vapour deposition.</p>
    <p num="79">
      Although in Examples 1 to 4 the ceramic was deposited while continuously moving the superalloy substrate between two positions which have different acute angles relative to the direction of flux of the ceramic vapours and passing through a third position where the superalloy substrate is perpendicular to the direction of flux of the ceramic vapours, it is possible for the superalloy substrate to be stopped, for a predetermined period of time, at each of the two positions which have different acute angles relative to the direction of flux of the ceramic vapours.
      <br/>
      It is also possible for the superalloy substrate to be stopped, for a predetermined period of time, in the third position.
      <br/>
      The ceramic may be any suitable ceramic for example zirconia, yttria stabilised zirconia, hafnia, ceria, alumina etc.
    </p>
    <p num="80">The ceramic thermal barrier coating is preferably deposited by a physical vapour deposition process, preferably electron beam physical vapour deposition or sputtering, however chemical vapour deposition or combustion chemical vapour deposition may be used, combustion chemical vapour deposition is disclosed in International patent application WO9721848A, published Jun. 19, 1997.</p>
    <p num="81">
      The surface of the ceramic thermal barrier coating may be polished to increase its surface smoothness particularly if it is to be used on the aerofoils of turbine blades or turbine vanes.
      <br/>
      The ceramic thermal barrier coating is preferably polished by vibropolishing using a porcelain polishing media sold under the trade name CP2 by Ceratex Engineering Ltd.
      <br/>
      The porcelain polishing media increases the surface smoothness of the ceramic thermal barrier coating without fracturing the columnar ceramic grains.
