    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for interleaving a bitstream for use in an authoring system for variously processing a data bitstream comprising the video data, audio data, and sub-picture data constituting-each of plural program titles containing related video data, audio data, and sub-picture data content to generate a bitstream from which a new title containing the content desired by the user can be reproduced, and efficiently recording and reproducing said generated bitstream using a particular recording medium.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Authoring systems used to produce program titles comprising related video data, audio data, and sub-picture data by digitally processing, for example, multimedia data comprising video, audio, and sub-picture data recorded to laser disk or video CD formats are currently available.
      <br/>
      Systems using Video-Cds in particular are able to record video data to a CD format disk, which was originally designed with an approximately 600 MB recording capacity for storing digital audio data only, by using such high efficiency video compression techniques as MPEG.
      <br/>
      As a result of the increased effective recording capacity achieved using data compression techniques, karaoke titles and other conventional laser disk applications are gradually being transferred to the video CD format.
      <br/>
      Users today expect both sophisticated title content and high reproduction quality.
      <br/>
      To meet these expectations, each title must be composed from bitstreams with an increasingly deep hierarchical structure.
      <br/>
      The data size of multimedia titles written with bitstreams having such deep hierarchical structures, however, is ten or more times greater than the data size of less complex titles.
      <br/>
      The need to edit small image (title) details also makes it necessary to process and control the bitstream using low order hierarchical data units.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It is therefore necessary to develop and prove a bitstream structure and an advanced digital processing method including both recording and reproduction capabilities whereby a large volume, multiple level hierarchical digital bitstream can be efficiently controlled at each level of the hierarchy.
      <br/>
      Also needed are an apparatus for executing this digital processing method, and a recording media to which the bitstream digitally processed by said apparatus can be efficiently recorded for storage and from which said recorded information can be quickly reproduced.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Means of increasing the storage capacity of conventional optical disks have been widely researched to address the recording medium aspect of this problem.
      <br/>
      One way to increase the storage capacity of the optical disk is to reduce the spot diameter D of the optical (laser) beam.
      <br/>
      If the wavelength of the laser beam is 1 and the aperture of the objective lens is NA, then the spot diameter D is proportional to l/NA, and the storage capacity can be efficiently improved by decreasing l and increasing NA.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      As described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,235,581, however, coma caused by a relative tilt between the disk surface and the optical axis of the laser beam (hereafter "tilt") increases when a large aperture (high NA) lens is used.
      <br/>
      To prevent tilt-induced coma, the transparent substrate must be made very thin.
      <br/>
      The problem is that the mechanical strength of the disk is low when the transparent substrate is very thin.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      MPEG1, the conventional method of recording and reproducing video, audio, and graphic signal data, has also been replaced by the more robust MPEG2 method, which can transfer large data volumes at a higher rate.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the compression method and data format of the MPEG2 standard differ somewhat from those of MPEG1.
      <br/>
      The specific content of and differences between MPEG1 and MPEG2 are described in detail in the ISO-11172 and ISO-13818 MPEG standards, and further description thereof is omitted below.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Note, however, that while the structure of the encoded video stream is defined in the MPEG2 specification, the hierarchical structure of the system stream and the method of processing lower hierarchical levels are not defined.</p>
    <p num="11">
      As described above, it is therefore not possible in a conventional authoring system to process a large data stream containing sufficient information to satisfy many different user requirements.
      <br/>
      Moreover, even if such a processing method were available, the processed data recorded thereto cannot be repeatedly used to reduce data redundancy because there is no large capacity recording medium currently available that can efficiently record and reproduce high volume bitstreams such as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      More specifically, particular significant hardware and software requirements must be satisfied in order to process a bitstream using a data unit smaller than the title.
      <br/>
      These specific hardware requirements include significantly increasing the storage capacity of the recording medium and increasing the speed of digital processing; software requirements include inventing an advanced digital processing method including a sophisticated data structure.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide an effective authoring system for controlling a multimedia data bitstream with advanced hardware and software requirements using a data unit smaller than the title to better address advanced user requirements.</p>
    <p num="14">To share data between plural titles and thereby efficiently utilize optical disk capacity, multi-scene control whereby scene data common to plural titles and the desired scenes on the same time-base from within multi-scene periods containing plural scenes unique to particular reproduction paths can be freely selected and reproduced is desirable.</p>
    <p num="15">
      However, when plural scenes unique to a reproduction path within the multi-scene period are arranged on the same time-base, the scene data must be contiguous.
      <br/>
      Unselected multi-scene data is therefore unavoidably inserted between the selected common scene data and the selected multi-scene data.
      <br/>
      The problem this creates when reproducing multi-scene data is that reproduction is interrupted by this unselected scene data.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a data structure enabling discrete scene data to be seamlessly reproduced, i.e., without intermittency in the data presentation, even when reproducing such multi-scene data; a method for generating a system stream having said data structure; a recording apparatus and a reproduction apparatus for recording and reproducing said system stream; and a medium to which said system stream can be recorded and from which said system stream can be reproduced by said recording apparatus and reproduction apparatus.</p>
    <p num="17">To share data between plural titles and thereby efficiently utilize optical disk capacity, multi-scene control whereby scene data common to plural titles and the desired scenes on the same time-base from within multi-scene periods containing plural scenes unique to particular reproduction paths can be freely selected and reproduced is desirable.</p>
    <p num="18">
      However, when plural scenes unique to a reproduction path within the multi-scene period are arranged on the same time-base, the scene data must be contiguous.
      <br/>
      Unselected multi-scene data is therefore unavoidably inserted between the selected common scene data and the selected multi-scene data.
      <br/>
      The problem this creates when reproducing multi-scene data is that reproduction is interrupted by this unselected scene data.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A further problem can be expected when the multi-scene data is multi-angle scene data, i.e., scene data showing substantially the same subject from different angles.
      <br/>
      In the case of a live sports broadcast, this multi-angle scene data may be obtained by recording a baseball batter, for example, with cameras in different locations.
      <br/>
      The problem is thus that when the user selects one of these plural angle scenes during data presentation, data from different angles is connected where the angle changes, and a natural, seamless presentation cannot be expected.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a data structure whereby natural, seamless reproduction without scene data intermitting can be achieved even in such multi-angle scene periods; a method for generating a system stream having said data structure; a recording apparatus and a reproduction apparatus for recording and reproducing said system stream; and a medium to which said system stream can be recorded and from which said system stream can be reproduced by said recording apparatus and reproduction apparatus.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="26">Data Structure of the Authoring System</p>
    <p num="27">The logic structure of the multimedia data bitstream processed using the recording apparatus, recording medium, reproduction apparatus, and authoring system according to the present invention is described first below with reference to FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="28">
      In this structure, one title refers to the combination of video and audio data expressing program content recognized by a user for education, entertainment, or other purpose.
      <br/>
      Referenced to a motion picture (movie), one title may correspond to the content of an entire movie, or to just one scene within said movie.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      A video title set (VTS) comprises the bitstream data containing the information for a specific number of titles.
      <br/>
      More specifically, each VTS comprises the video, audio, and other reproduction data representing the content of each title in the set, and control data for controlling the content data.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The video zone VZ is the video data unit processed by the authoring system, and comprises a specific number of video title sets.
      <br/>
      More specifically, each video zone is a linear sequence of K+1 video title sets numbered VTS -0-VTS -K where K is an integer value of zero or greater.
      <br/>
      One video title set, preferably the first video title set VTS -0, is used as the video manager describing the content information of the titles contained in each video title set.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The multimedia bitstream MBS is the largest control unit of the multimedia data bitstream handled by the authoring system of the present invention, and comprises plural video zones VZ.</p>
    <p num="32">Authoring Encoder EC</p>
    <p num="33">
      A preferred embodiment of the authoring encoder EC according to the present invention for generating a new multimedia bitstream MBS by re-encoding the original multimedia bitstream MBS according to the scenario desired by the user is shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Note that the original multimedia bitstream MBS comprises a video stream St1 containing the video information, a sub-picture stream St3 containing caption text and other auxiliary video information, and the audio stream St5 containing the audio information.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The video and audio streams are the bitstreams containing the video and audio information obtained from the source within a particular period of time.
      <br/>
      The sub-picture stream is a bitstream containing momentary video information relevant to a particular scene.
      <br/>
      The sub-picture data encoded to a single scene may be captured to video memory and displayed continuously from the video memory for plural scenes as may be necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="35">When this multimedia source data St1, St3, and St5 is obtained from a live broadcast, the video and audio signals are supplied in real-time from a video camera or other imaging source; when the multimedia source data is reproduced from a video tape or other recording medium, the audio and video signals are not real-time signals.</p>
    <p num="36">
      While the multimedia source stream is shown in FIG. 2 as comprising these three source signals, this is for convenience only, and it should be noted that the multimedia source stream may contain more than three types of source signals, and may contain source data for different titles.
      <br/>
      Multimedia source data with audio, video, and sub-picture data for plural titles are referred to below as multi-title streams.
    </p>
    <p num="37">As shown in FIG. 2, the authoring encoder EC comprises a scenario editor 100, encoding system controller 200, video encoder 300, video stream buffer 400, sub-picture encoder 500, sub-picture stream buffer 600, audio encoder 700, audio stream buffer 800, system encoder 900, video zone formatter 1300, recorder 1200, and recording medium M.</p>
    <p num="38">The video zone formatter 1300 comprises video object (VOB) buffer 1000, formatter 1100, and volume and file structure formatter 1400.</p>
    <p num="39">The bitstream encoded by the authoring encoder EC of the present embodiment is recorded by way of example only to an optical disk.</p>
    <p num="40">
      The scenario editor 100 of the authoring encoder EC outputs the scenario data, i.e., the user-defined editing instructions.
      <br/>
      The scenario data controls editing the corresponding parts of the multimedia bitstream MBS according to the user's manipulation of the video, sub-picture, and audio components of the original multimedia title.
      <br/>
      This scenario editor 100 preferably comprises a display, speaker(s), keyboard, CPU, and source stream buffer.
      <br/>
      The scenario editor 100 is connected to an external multimedia bitstream source from which the multimedia source data St1, St3, and St5 are supplied.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The user is thus able to reproduce the video and audio components of the multimedia source data using the display and speaker to confirm the content of the generated title.
      <br/>
      The user is then able to edit the title content according to the desired scenario using the keyboard, mouse, and other command input devices while confirming the content of the title on the display and speakers.
      <br/>
      The result of this multimedia data manipulation is the scenario data St7.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The scenario data St7 is basically a set of instructions describing what source data is selected from all or a subset of the source data containing plural titles within a defined time period, and how the selected source data is reassembled to reproduce the scenario (sequence) intended by the user.
      <br/>
      Based on the instructions received through the keyboard or other control device, the CPU codes the position, length, and the relative time-based positions of the edited parts of the respective multimedia source data streams St1, St3, and St5 to generate the scenario data St7.
    </p>
    <p num="43">The source stream buffer has a specific capacity, and is used to delay the multimedia source data streams St1, St3, and St5 a known time Td and then output streams St1, St3, and St5.</p>
    <p num="44">
      This delay is required for synchronization with the editor encoding process.
      <br/>
      More specifically, when data encoding and user generation of scenario data St7 are executed simultaneously, i.e., when encoding immediately follows editing, time Td is required to determine the content of the multimedia source data editing process based on the scenario data St7 as will be described further below.
      <br/>
      As a result, the multimedia source data must be delayed by time Td to synchronize the editing process during the actual encoding operation.
      <br/>
      Because this delay time Td is limited to the time required to synchronize the operation of the various system components in the case of sequential editing as described above, the source stream buffer is normally achieved by means of a high speed storage medium such as semiconductor memory.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      During batch editing in which all multimedia source data is encoded at once ("batch encoded") after scenario data St7 is generated for the complete title, delay time Td must be long enough to process the complete title or longer.
      <br/>
      In this case, the source stream buffer may be a low speed, high capacity storage medium such as video tape, magnetic disk, or optical disk.
    </p>
    <p num="46">The structure (type) of media used for the source stream buffer may therefore be determined according to the delay time Td required and the allowable manufacturing cost.</p>
    <p num="47">
      The encoding system controller 200 is connected to the scenario editor 100 and receives the scenario data St7 therefrom.
      <br/>
      Based on the time-base position and length information of the edit segment contained in the scenario data St7, the encoding system controller 200 generates the encoding parameter signals St9, St11, and St13 for encoding the edit segment of the multimedia source data.
      <br/>
      The encoding signals St9, St11, and St13 supply the parameters used for video, sub-picture, and audio encoding, including the encoding start and end timing.
      <br/>
      Note that multimedia source data St1, St3, and St5 are output after delay time Td by the source stream buffer, and are therefore synchronized to encoding parameter signals St9, St11, and St13.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      More specifically, encoding parameter signal St9 is the video encoding signal specifying the encoding timing of video stream St1 to extract the encoding segment from the video stream St1 and generate the video encoding unit.
      <br/>
      Encoding parameter signal st11 is likewise the sub-picture stream encoding signal used to generate the sub-picture encoding unit by specifying the encoding timing for sub-picture stream St3.
      <br/>
      Encoding parameter signal St13 is the audio encoding signal used to generate the audio encoding unit by specifying the encoding timing for audio stream St5.
    </p>
    <p num="49">Based on the time-base relationship between the encoding segments of streams St1, St3, and St5 in the multimedia source data contained in scenario data St7, the encoding system controller 200 generates the timing signals St21, St23, and St25 arranging the encoded multimedia-encoded stream in the specified time-base relationship.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The encoding system controller 200 also generates the reproduction time information IT defining the reproduction time of the title editing unit (video object, VOB), and the stream encoding data St33 defining the system encode parameters for multiplexing the encoded multimedia stream containing video, audio, and sub-picture data.
      <br/>
      Note that the reproduction time information IT and stream encoding data St33 are generated for the video object VOB of each title in one video zone VZ.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The encoding system controller 200 also generates the title sequence control signal St39, which declares the formatting parameters for formatting the title editing units VOB of each of the streams in a particular time-base relationship as a multimedia bitstream.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the title sequence control signal St39 is used to control the connections between the title editing units (VOB) of each title in the multimedia bitstream MBS, or to control the sequence of the interleaved title editing unit (VOBs) interleaving the title editing units VOB of plural reproduction paths.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The video encoder 300 is connected to the source stream buffer of-the scenario editor 100 and to the encoding system controller 200, and receives therefrom the video stream St1 and video encoding parameter signal St9, respectively.
      <br/>
      Encoding parameters supplied by the video encoding signal St9 include the encoding start and end timing, bit rate, the encoding conditions for the encoding start and end, and the material type.
      <br/>
      Possible material types include NTSC or PAL video signal, and telecine converted material.
      <br/>
      Based on the video encoding parameter signal St9, the video encoder 300 encodes a specific part of the video stream St1 to generate the encoded video stream St15.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The sub-picture encoder 500 is similarly connected to the source stream buffer of the scenario editor 100 and to the encoding system controller 200, and receives therefrom the sub-picture stream St3 and sub-picture encoding parameter signal St11, respectively.
      <br/>
      Based on the sub-picture encoding parameter signal St11, the sub-picture encoder 500 encodes a specific part of the sub-picture stream St3 to generate the encoded sub-picture stream St17.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The audio encoder 700 is also connected to the source stream buffer of the scenario editor 100 and to the encoding system controller 200, and receives therefrom the audio stream St5 and audio encoding parameter signal St13, which supplies the encoding start and end timing.
      <br/>
      Based on the audio encoding parameter signal St13, the audio encoder 700 encodes a specific part of the audio stream St5 to generate the encoded audio stream St19.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The video stream buffer 400 is connected to the video encoder 300 and to the encoding system controller 200.
      <br/>
      The video stream buffer 400 stores the encoded video stream St15 input from the video encoder 300, and outputs the stored encoded video stream St15 as the time-delayed encoded video stream St27 based on the timing signal St1 supplied from the encoding system controller 200.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The sub-picture stream buffer 600 is similarly connected to the sub-picture encoder 500 and to the encoding system controller 200.
      <br/>
      The sub-picture stream buffer 600 stores the encoded sub-picture stream St17 output from the sub-picture encoder 500, and then outputs the stored encoded sub-picture stream St17 as time-delayed encoded sub-picture stream St29 based on the timing signal St23 supplied from the encoding system controller 200.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The audio stream buffer 800 is similarly connected to the audio encoder 700 and to the encoding system controller 200.
      <br/>
      The audio stream buffer 800 stores the encoded audio stream St19 input from the audio encoder 700, and then outputs the encoded audio stream St19 as the time-delayed encoded audio stream St31 based on the timing signal St25 supplied from the encoding system controller 200.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The system encoder 900 is connected to the video stream buffer 400, sub-picture stream buffer 600, audio stream buffer 800, and the encoding system controller 200, and is respectively supplied thereby with the time-delayed encoded video stream St27, time-delayed encoded sub-picture stream St29, time-delayed encoded audio stream St31, and the stream encoding data St33.
      <br/>
      Note that the system encoder 900 is a multiplexer that multiplexes the time-delayed streams St27, St29, and St31 based on the stream encoding data St33 (timing signal) to generate title editing unit (VOB) St35. The stream encoding data St33 contains the system encoding parameters, including the encoding start and end timing.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The video zone formatter 1300 is connected to the system encoder 900 and the encoding system controller 200 from which the title editing unit (VOB) St35 and title sequence control signal St39 (timing signal) are respectively supplied.
      <br/>
      The title sequence control signal St39 contains the formatting start and end timing, and the formatting parameters used to generate (format) a multimedia bitstream MBS.
      <br/>
      The video zone formatter 1300 rearranges the title editing units (VOB) St35 in one video zone VZ in the scenario sequence defined by the user based on the title sequence control signal St39 to generate the edited multimedia stream data St43.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The multimedia bitstream MBS St43 edited according to the user-defined scenario is then sent to the recorder 1200.
      <br/>
      The recorder 1200 processes the edited multimedia stream data St43 to the data stream St45 format of the recording medium M, and thus records the formatted data stream St45 to the recording medium M. Note that the multimedia bitstream MBS recorded to the recording medium M contains the volume file structure VFS, which includes the physical address of the data on the recording medium generated by the video zone formatter 1300.

      So that the user-defined video, sub-picture, and audio portions of the multimedia title edited by the authoring encoder EC are reproduced, the authoring decoder DC comprises a scenario selector 2100 for selecting and reproducing the corresponding scenes (titles).

      The scenario selector 2100 then outputs the selected titles as scenario data to the authoring decoder DC.

      The scenario selector 2100 preferably comprises a keyboard, CPU, and monitor.

      Based on the keyboard input, the CPU generates the scenario selection data St51 specifying the selected scenario.

      The system decoder 2500 detects the presentation time stamp PTS and decoding time stamp DTS of the smallest control unit in each bitstream St67 to generate the time information signal St77.

      Based on this synchronization control data St81, the synchronizer 2900 determines the decoding start timing whereby each of the bitstreams will be arranged in the correct sequence after decoding, and then generates and inputs the video stream decoding start signal St89 to the video decoder 3800 based on this decoding timing.
      <br/>
      The synchronizer 2900 also generates and supplies the sub-picture decoding start signal St91 and audio stream decoding start signal St93 to the sub-picture decoder 3100 and audio decoder 3200, respectively.

      The video decoder 3800 generates the video output request signal St84 based on the video stream decoding start signal St89, and outputs to the video buffer 2600.

      The video decoder 3800 thus detects the presentation time information contained in the video stream St83, and disables the video output request signal St84 when the length of the received video stream St83 is equivalent to the specified presentation time.
      <br/>
      A video stream equal in length to the specified presentation time is thus decoded by the video decoder 3800, which outputs the reproduced video signal St104 to the synthesizer 3500.

      In response to the sub-picture output request signal St86, the sub-picture buffer 2700 outputs the sub-picture stream St85 to the sub-picture decoder 3100.

      Based on the presentation time information contained in the sub-picture stream St85, the sub-picture decoder 3100 decodes a length of the sub-picture stream St85 corresponding to the specified presentation time to reproduce and supply to the synthesizer 3500 the sub-picture signal st99.

      It is thus possible to reproduce a user-defined multimedia bitstream MBS in real-time according to a user-defined scenario.

    <p num="83">It is therefore possible by means of the authoring system of the present invention to generate a multimedia bitstream according to plural user-defined scenarios by real-time or batch encoding multimedia source data in a manner whereby the substreams of the smallest editing units (scenes), which can be divided into plural substreams, expressing the basic title content are arranged in a specific time-base relationship.</p>

    <p num="87">Digital Video Disk (DVD)</p>
    <p num="88">An example of a digital video disk (DVD) with only one recording surface (a single-sided DVD) is shown in FIG. 4.</p>
    <p num="89">
      The DVD recording medium RC1 in the preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a data recording surface RS1 to and from which data is written and read by emitting laser beam LS, and a protective layer PL1 covering the data recording surface RS1.
      <br/>
      A backing layer BL1 is also provided on the back of data recording surface RS1.
      <br/>
      The side of the disk on which protective layer PL1 is provided is therefore referred to below as side SA (commonly "side A"), and the opposite side (on which the backing layer BL1 is provided) is referred to as side SB ("side B").
      <br/>
      Note that digital video disk recording media having a single data recording surface RS1 on only one side such as this DVD recording medium RC1 is commonly called a single-sided single layer disk.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      A detailed illustration of area C1 in FIG. 4 is shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      Note that the data recording surface RS1 is formed by applying a metallic thin film or other reflective coating as a data layer 4109 on a first transparent layer 4108 having a particular thickness T1.
      <br/>
      This first transparent layer 4108 also functions as the protective layer PL1.
      <br/>
      A second transparent substrate 4111 of a thickness T2 functions as the backing layer BL1, and is bonded to the first transparent layer 4108 by means of an adhesive layer 4110 disposed therebetween.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      A printing layer 4112 for printing a disk label may also be disposed on the second transparent substrate 4111 as necessary.
      <br/>
      The printing layer 4112 does not usually cover the entire surface area of the second transparent substrate 4111 (backing layer BL1), but only the area needed to print the text and graphics of the disk label.
      <br/>
      The area of second transparent substrate 4111 to which the printing layer 4112 is not formed may be left exposed.
      <br/>
      Light reflected from the data layer 4109 (metallic thin film) forming the data recording surface RS1 can therefore be directly observed where the label is not printed when the digital video disk is viewed from side SB.
      <br/>
      As a result, the background looks like a silver-white over which the printed text and graphics float when the metallic thin film is an aluminum thin film, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="92">Note that it is only necessary to provide the printing layer 4112 where needed for printing, and it is not necessary to provide the printing layer 4112 over the entire surface of the backing layer BL1.</p>
    <p num="93">
      A detailed illustration of area C2 in FIG. 5 is shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Pits and lands are molded to the common contact surface between the first transparent layer 4108 and the data layer 4109 on side SA from which data is read by emitting a laser beam LS, and data is recorded by varying the lengths of the pits and lands (i.e., the length of the intervals between the pits).
      <br/>
      More specifically, the pit and land configuration formed on the first transparent layer 4108 is transferred to the data layer 4109.
      <br/>
      The lengths of the pits and lands is shorter, and the pitch of the data tracks formed by the pit sequences is narrower, than with a conventional Compact Disc (CD).
      <br/>
      The surface recording density is therefore greatly improved.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      Side SA of the first transparent layer 4108 on which data pits are not formed is a flat surface.
      <br/>
      The second transparent substrate 4111 is for reinforcement, and is a transparent panel made from the same material as the first transparent layer 4108 with both sides flat.
      <br/>
      Thicknesses T1 and T2 are preferably equal and commonly approximately 0.6 mm, but the invention shall not be so limited.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      As with a CD, information is read by irradiating the surface with a laser beam LS and detecting the change in the reflectivity of the light spot.
      <br/>
      Because the objective lens aperture NA can be large and the wavelength l of the light beam small in a digital video disk system, the diameter of the light spot Ls used can be reduced to approximately 1/1.6 the light spot needed to read a CD.
      <br/>
      Note that this means the resolution of the laser beam LS in the DVD system is approximately 1.6 times the resolution of a conventional CD system.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      The optical system used to read data from the digital video disk uses a short 650 nm wavelength red semiconductor laser and an objective lens with a 0.6 mm .aperture NA.
      <br/>
      By thus also reducing the thickness T of the transparent panels to 0.6 mm, more than 5 GB of data can be stored to one side of a 120 mm diameter optical disk.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      It is therefore possible to store motion picture (video) images having an extremely large per unit data size to a digital video disk system disk without losing image quality because the storage capacity of a single-sided, single-layer recording medium RC1 with one data recording surface RS1 as thus described is nearly ten times the storage capacity of a conventional CD.
      <br/>
      As a result, while the video presentation time of a conventional CD system is approximately 74 minutes if image quality is sacrificed, high quality video images with a video presentation time exceeding two hours can be recorded to a DVD.
    </p>
    <p num="98">The digital video disk is therefore well-suited as a recording medium for video images.</p>
    <p num="99">
      A digital video disk recording medium with plural recording surfaces RS as described above is shown in FIGS. 7 and 8.
      <br/>
      The DVD recording medium RC2 shown in FIG. 7 comprises two recording surfaces, i.e., first recording surface RS1 and semi-transparent second recording surface RS2, on the same side, i.e. side SA, of the disk.
      <br/>
      Data can be simultaneously recorded or reproduced from these two recording surfaces by using different laser beams LS1 and LS2 for the first recording surface RS1 and the second recording surface RS2.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to read/write both recording surfaces RS1 and RS2 using only one of the laser beams LS1 or LS2.
      <br/>
      Note that recording media thus comprised are called "single-side, dual-layer disks."
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      It should also be noted that while two recording surfaces RS1 and RS2 are provided in this example, it is also possible to produce digital video disk recording media having more than two recording surfaces RS.
      <br/>
      Disks thus comprised are known as "single-sided, multi-layer disks."
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      Though comprising two recording surfaces similarly to the recording media shown in FIG. 7, the DVD recording medium RC3 shown in FIG. 8 has the recording surfaces on opposite sides of the disk, i. e., has the first data recording surface RS1 on side SA and the second data recording surface RS2 on side SB.
      <br/>
      It will also be obvious that while only two recording surfaces are shown on one digital video disk in this example, more than two recording surfaces may also be formed on a double-sided digital video disk.
      <br/>
      As with the recording medium shown in FIG. 7, it is also possible to provide two separate laser beams LS1 and LS2 for recording surfaces RS1 and RS2, or to read/write both recording surfaces RS1 and RS2 using a single laser beam.
      <br/>
      Note that this type of digital video disk is called a "double-sided, dual-layer disk." It will also be obvious that a double-sided digital video disk can be comprised with two or more recording surfaces per side.
      <br/>
      This type of disk is called a "double-sided, multi-layer disk."
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      A plan view from the laser beam LS irradiation side of the recording surface RS of the DVD recording medium RC is shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 10. Note that a continuous spiral data recording track TR is provided from the inside circumference to the outside circumference of the DVD.
      <br/>
      The data recording track TR is divided into plural sectors each having the same known storage capacity.
      <br/>
      Note that for simplicity only the data recording track TR is shown in FIG. 9 with more than three sectors per revolution.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      As shown in FIG. 9, the data recording track TR is normally formed clockwise inside to outside (see arrow DrA) from the inside end point IA at the inside circumference of disk RCA to the outside end point OA at the outside circumference of the disk with the disk RCA rotating counterclockwise RdA.
      <br/>
      This type of disk RCA is called a clockwise disk, and the recording track formed thereon is called a clockwise track TRA.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      Depending upon the application, the recording track TRB may be formed clockwise from outside to inside circumference (see arrow DrB in FIG. 10) from the outside end point OB at the outside circumference of disk RCB to the inside end point IB at the inside circumference of the disk with the disk RCB rotating clockwise RdB.
      <br/>
      Because the recording track appears to wind counterclockwise when viewed from the inside circumference to the outside circumference on disks with the recording track formed in the direction of arrow DrB, these disks are referred to as counterclockwise disk RCB with counterclockwise track TRB to distinguish them from disk RCA in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      Note that track directions DrA and DrB are the track paths along which the laser beam travels when scanning the tracks for recording and playback.
      <br/>
      Direction of disk rotation RdA in which disk RCA turns is thus opposite the direction of track path DrA, and direction of disk rotation RdB in which disk RCB turns is thus opposite the direction of track path DrB.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      An exploded view of the single-sided, dual-layer disk RC2 shown in FIG. 7 is shown as disk RC2o in FIG. 11. Note that the recording tracks formed on the two recording surfaces run in opposite directions.
      <br/>
      Specifically, a clockwise recording track TRA as shown in FIG. 9 is formed in clockwise direction DrA on the (lower) first data recording surface RS1, and a counterclockwise recording track TRB formed in counterclockwise direction DrB as shown in FIG. 10 is provided on the (upper) second data recording surface RS2.
      <br/>
      As a result, the outside end points OA and OB of the first and second (top and bottom) tracks are at the same radial position relative to the center axis of the disk RC2o.
      <br/>
      Note that track paths DrA and DrB of tracks TR are also the data read/write directions to disk RC.
      <br/>
      The first and second (top and bottom) recording tracks thus wind opposite each other with this disk RC, i.e., the track paths DrA and DrB of the top and bottom recording layers are opposite track paths.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      Opposite track path type, single-sided, dual-layer disks RC2o rotate in direction RdA corresponding to the first recording surface RS1 with the laser beam LS travelling along track path DrA to trace the recording track on the first recording surface RS1.
      <br/>
      When the laser beam LS reaches the outside end point OA, the laser beam LS can be refocused to end point OB on the second recording surface RS2 to continue tracing the recording track from the first to the second recording surface uninterrupted.
      <br/>
      The physical distance between the recording tracks TRA and TRB on the first and second recording surfaces RS1 and RS2 can thus be instantaneously eliminated by simply adjusting the focus of the laser beam LS.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      It is therefore possible with an opposite track path type, single-sided, dual-layer disk RC2o to easily process the recording tracks disposed to physically discrete top and bottom recording surfaces as a single continuous recording track.
      <br/>
      It is therefore also possible in an authoring system as described above with reference to FIG. 1 to continuously record the multimedia bitstream MBS that is the largest multimedia data management unit to two discrete recording surfaces RS1 and RS2 on a single recording medium RC2o.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      It should be noted that the tracks on recording surfaces RS1 and RS2 can be wound in the directions opposite those described above, i.e., the counterclockwise track TRB may be provided on the first recording surface RS1 and the clockwise track TRA on the second recording surface RS2.
      <br/>
      In this case the direction of disk rotation is also changed to a clockwise rotation RdB, thereby enabling the two recording surfaces to be used as comprising a single continuous recording track as described above.
      <br/>
      For simplification, a further example of this type of disk is therefore neither shown nor described below.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      It is therefore possible by thus constructing the digital video disk to record the multimedia bitstream MBS for a feature-length title to a single opposite track path type, single-sided, dual-layer disk RC2o.
      <br/>
      Note that this type of digital video disk medium is called a single-sided dual-layer disk with opposite track paths.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      Another example of the single-sided, dual-layer DVD recording medium RC2 shown in FIG. 7 is shown as disk RC2p in FIG. 12. The recording tracks formed on both first and second recording surfaces RS1 and RS2 are clockwise tracks TRA as shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      In this case, the single-sided, dual-layer disk RC2p rotates counterclockwise in the direction of arrow RdA, and the direction of laser beam LS travel is the same as the direction of the track spiral, i.e., the track paths of the top and bottom recording surfaces are mutually parallel (parallel track paths).
      <br/>
      The outside end points OA of both top and bottom tracks are again preferably positioned at the same radial position relative to the center axis of the disk RC2p as described above.
      <br/>
      As also described above with disk RC2o shown in FIG. 11, the access point can be instantaneously shifted from outside end point OA of track TRA on the first recording surface RS1 to the outside end point OA of track TRA on the second recording surface RS2 by appropriately adjusting the focus of the laser beam LS at outside end point OA.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      However, for the laser beam LS to continuously access the clockwise recording track TRA on the second recording surface RS2, the recording medium RC2p must be driven in the opposite direction (clockwise, opposite direction RdA).
      <br/>
      Depending on the radial position of the laser beam LS, however, it is inefficient to change the rotational direction of the recording medium.
      <br/>
      As shown by the diagonal arrow in FIG. 12, the laser beam LS is therefore moved from the outside end point OA of the track on the first recording surface RS1 to the inside end point IA of the track on the second recording surface RS2 to use these physically discrete recording tracks as one logically continuous recording track.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      Rather than using the recording tracks on top and bottom recording surfaces as one continuous recording track, it is also possible to use the recording tracks to record the multimedia bitstreams MBS for different titles.
      <br/>
      This type of digital video disk recording medium is called a "single-sided, dual-layer disk with parallel track paths."
    </p>
    <p num="113">Note that if the direction of the tracks formed on the recording surfaces RS1 and RS2 is opposite that described above, i.e., counterclockwise recording tracks TRB are formed, disk operation remains the same as that described above except for the direction of disk rotation, which is clockwise as shown by arrow RdB.</p>
    <p num="114">Whether using clockwise or counterclockwise recording tracks, the single-sided, dual-layer disk RC2p with parallel track paths thus described is well-suited to storing on a single disk encyclopedia and similar multimedia bitstreams comprising multiple titles that are frequently and randomly accessed.</p>
    <p num="115">
      An exploded view of the dual-sided single-layer DVD recording medium RC3 comprising one recording surface layer RS1 and RS2 on each side as shown in FIG. 8 is shown as DVD recording medium RC3s in FIG. 13. Clockwise recording track TRA is provided on the one recording surface RS1, and a counterclockwise recording track TRB is provided on the other recording surface RS2.
      <br/>
      As in the preceding recording media, the outside end points OA and OB of the recording tracks on each recording surface are preferably positioned at the same radial position relative to the center axis of the DVD recording medium RC3s.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      Note that while the recording tracks on these recording surfaces RS1 and RS2 rotate in opposite directions, the track-paths are symmetrical.
      <br/>
      This type of recording medium is therefore known as a double-sided dual layer disk with symmetrical track paths.
      <br/>
      This double-sided dual layer disk with symmetrical track paths RC3s rotates in direction RdA when reading/writing the first recording surface RS1.
      <br/>
      As a result, the track path on the second recording surface RS2 on the opposite side is opposite the direction DrB in which the track winds, i.e., direction DrA.
      <br/>
      Accessing both recording surfaces RS1 and RS2 using a single laser beam LS is therefore not realistic irrespective of whether access is continuous or non-continuous.
      <br/>
      In addition, a multimedia bitstream MBS is separately recorded to the recording surfaces on the first and second sides of the disk.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      A different example of the double-sided single layer disk RC3 shown in FIG. 8 is shown in FIG. 14 as disk RC3a.
      <br/>
      Note that this disk comprises clockwise recording tracks TRA as shown in FIG. 9 on both recording surfaces RS1 and RS2.
      <br/>
      As with the preceding recording media, the outside end points OA and OA of the recording tracks on each recording surface are preferably positioned at the same radial position relative to the center axis of the DVD recording medium RC3a.
      <br/>
      Unlike the double-sided dual layer disk with symmetrical track paths RC3s described above, the tracks on these recording surfaces RS1 and RS2 are asymmetrical.
      <br/>
      This type of disk is therefore known as a double-sided dual layer disk with asymmetrical track paths.
      <br/>
      This double-sided dual layer disk with asymmetrical track paths RC3a rotates in direction RdA when reading/writing the first recording surface RS1.
      <br/>
      As a result, the track path on the second recording surface RS2 on the opposite side is opposite the direction DrA in which the track winds, i.e., direction DrB.
    </p>
    <p num="118">This means that if a laser beam LS is driven continuously from the inside circumference to the outside circumference on the first recording surface RS1, and then from the outside circumference to the inside circumference on the second recording surface RS2, both sides of the recording medium RC3a can be read/written without turning the disk over and without providing different laser beams for the two sides.</p>
    <p num="119">
      The track paths for recording surfaces RS1 and RS2 are also the same with this double-sided dual layer disk with asymmetrical track paths RC3a.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is also possible to read/write both sides of the disk without providing separate laser beams for each side if the recording medium RC3a is turned over between sides, and the read/write apparatus can therefore be constructed economically.
    </p>
    <p num="120">It should be noted that this recording medium remains functionally identical even if counterclockwise recording track TRB is provided in place of clockwise recording track TRA on both recording surfaces RS1 and RS2.</p>
    <p num="121">As described above, the true value of a DVD system whereby the storage capacity of the recording medium can be easily increased by using a multiple layer recording surface is realized in multimedia applications whereby plural video data units, plural audio data units, and plural graphics data units recorded to a single disk are reproduced through interactive operation by the user.</p>
    <p num="122">It is therefore possible to achieve one long-standing desire of software (programming) providers, specifically, to provide programming content such as a commercial movie on a single recording medium in plural versions for different language and demographic groups while retaining the image quality of the original.</p>
    <p num="123">Parental Control</p>
    <p num="124">
      Content providers of movie and video titles have conventionally had to produce, supply, and manage the inventory of individual titles in multiple languages, typically the language of each distribution market, and multi-rated title packages conforming to the parental control (censorship) regulations of individual countries in Europe and North America.
      <br/>
      The time and resources required for this are significant.
      <br/>
      While high image quality is obviously important, the programming content must also be consistently reproducible.
    </p>
    <p num="125">The digital video disk recording medium is close to solving these problems.</p>
    <p num="126">Multiple Angles</p>
    <p num="127">
      One interactive operation widely sought in multimedia applications today is for the user to be able to change the position from which a scene is viewed during reproduction of that scene.
      <br/>
      This capability is achieved by means of the multiple angle function.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      This multiple angle function makes possible applications whereby, for example, a user can watch a baseball game from different angles (or virtual positions in the stadium), and can freely switch between the views while viewing is in progress.
      <br/>
      In this example of a baseball game, the available angles may include a position behind the backstop centered on the catcher, batter, and pitcher; one from behind the backstop centered on a fielder, the pitcher, and the catcher; and one from center field showing the view to the pitcher and catcher.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      To meet these requirements, the digital video disk system uses MPEG, the same basic standard format used with Video-Cds to record the video, audio, graphics, and other signal data.
      <br/>
      Because of the differences in storage capacity, transfer rates, and signal processing performance within the reproduction apparatus, DVD uses MPEG2, the compression method and data format of which differ slightly from the MPEG1 format used with Video-Cds.
    </p>
    <p num="130">It should be noted that the content of and differences between the MPEG1 and MPEG2 standards have no direct relationship to the intent of the present invention, and further description is therefore omitted below (for more information, see MPEG specifications ISO-11172 and ISO-13818).</p>
    <p num="131">The data structure of the DVD system according to the present invention is described in detail below with reference to FIGS. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21.</p>
    <p num="132">Multi-scene Control</p>
    <p num="133">
      A fully functional and practical parental lock playback function and multi-angle scene playback function must enable the user to modify the system output in minor, subtle ways while still presenting substantially the same video and audio output.
      <br/>
      If these functions are achieved by preparing and recording separate titles satisfying each of the many possible parental lock and multi-angle scene playback requests, titles that are substantially identical and differ in only minor ways must be recorded to the recording medium.
      <br/>
      This results in identical data being repeatedly recorded to the larger part of the recording medium, and significantly reduces the utilization efficiency of the available storage capacity.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it is virtually impossible to record discrete titles satisfying every possible request even using the massive capacity of the digital video disk medium.
      <br/>
      While it may be concluded that this problem can be easily solved by increasing the capacity of the recording medium, this is an obviously undesirable solution when the effective use of available system resources is considered.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      Using multi-scene control, the concept of which is described in another section below, in a DVD system, it is possible to dynamically construct titles for numerous variations of the same basic content using the smallest possible amount of data, and thereby effectively utilize the available system resources (recording medium).
      <br/>
      More specifically, titles that can be played back with numerous variations are constructed from basic (common) scene periods containing data common to each title, and multi-scene periods comprising groups of different scenes corresponding to the various requests.
      <br/>
      During reproduction, the user is able to freely and at any time select particular scenes from the multi-scene periods to dynamically construct a title conforming to the desired content, e. g. , a title omitting certain scenes using the parental lock control function.
    </p>
    <p num="135">Note that multi-scene control enabling a parental lock playback control function and multi-angle scene playback is described in another section below with reference to FIG. 21.</p>
    <p num="136">Data Structure of the DVD System</p>
    <p num="137">The data structure used in the authoring system of a digital video disk system according to the present invention is shown in FIG. 22. To record a multimedia bitstream MBS, this digital video disk system divides the recording medium into three major recording areas, the lead-in area LI, the volume space VS, and the lead-out area LO.</p>
    <p num="138">
      The lead-in area LI is provided at the inside circumference area of the optical disk.
      <br/>
      In the disks described with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10, the lead-in area LI is positioned at the inside end points IA and IB of each track.
      <br/>
      Data for stabilizing the operation of the reproducing apparatus when reading starts is written to the lead-in area LI.
    </p>
    <p num="139">The lead-out area LO is correspondingly located at the outside circumference of the optical disk, i.e., at outside end points OA and OB of each track in the disks described with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10. Data identifying the end of the volume space VS is recorded in this lead-out area LO.</p>
    <p num="140">
      The volume space VS is located between the lead-in area LI and lead-out area LO, and is recorded as a one-dimensional array of n+l (where n is an integer greater than or equal to zero) 2048-byte logic sectors LS.
      <br/>
      The logic sectors LS are sequentially number -0, -1, -2, . . . -n. The volume space VS is also divided into a volume and file structure management area VFS and a file data structure area FDS.
    </p>
    <p num="141">The volume and file structure management area VFS comprises m+1 logic sectors LS-0 to LS-m (where m is an integer greater than or equal to zero and less than n. The file data structure FDS comprises n-m logic sectors LS -m+1 to LS -n.</p>
    <p num="142">Note that this file data structure area FDS corresponds to the multimedia bitstream MBS shown in FIG. 1 and described above.</p>
    <p num="143">The volume file structure VFS is the file system for managing the data stored to the volume space VS as files, and is divided into logic sectors LS-0-LS-m where m is the number of sectors required to store all data needed to manage the entire disk, and is a natural number less than n. Information for the files stored to the file data structure area FDS is written to the volume file structure VFS according to a known specification such as IS0-9660 or IS0-13346.</p>
    <p num="144">The file data structure area FDS comprises n-m logic sectors LS-m-LS-n, each comprising a video manager VMG sized to an integer multiple of the logic sector (2048 * I, where I is a known integer), and k video title sets VTS -1-VTS-k (where k is a natural number less than 100).</p>
    <p num="145">The video manager VMG stores the title management information for the entire disk, and information for building a volume menu used to set and change reproduction control of the entire volume.</p>
    <p num="146">Any video title set VTS -k is also called a "video file" representing a title comprising video, audio, and/or still image data.</p>
    <p num="147">
      The internal structure of each video title set VTS shown in FIG. 22 is shown in FIG. 16. Each video title set VTS comprises VTS information VTSI describing the management information for the entire disk, and the VTS title video objects VOB (VTSTT_VOBS), i.e., the system stream of the multimedia bitstream.
      <br/>
      The VTS information VTSI is described first below, followed by the VTS title VOBS.
    </p>
    <p num="148">The VTS information primarily includes the VTSI management table VTSI_MAT and VTSPGC information table VTS_PGCIT.</p>
    <p num="149">The VTSI management table VTSI_MAT stores such information as the internal structure of the video title set VTS, the number of selectable audio streams contained in the video title set VTS, the number of sub-pictures, and the video title set VTS location (storage address).</p>
    <p num="150">
      The VTSPGC information table VTS_PGCIT records i (where i is a natural number) program chain (PGC) data blocks VTS_PGCI -1-VTS_PGCI -i for controlling the playback sequence.
      <br/>
      Each of the table entries VTS_PGCI -i is a data entry expressing the program chain, and comprises j (where j is a natural number) cell playback information blocks C_PBI -1-C_PBI -j.
      <br/>
      Each cell playback information block C_PBI -j contains the playback sequence of the cell and playback control information.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      The program chain PGC is a conceptual structure describing the story of the title content, and therefore defines the structure of each title by describing the cell playback sequence.
      <br/>
      Note that these cells are described in detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      If, for example, the video title set information relates to the menus, the video title set information VTSI is stored to a buffer in the playback device when playback starts.
      <br/>
      If the user then presses a MENU button on a remote control device, for example, during playback, the playback device references the buffer to fetch the menu information and display the top menu -1.
      <br/>
      If the menus are hierarchical, the main menu stored as program chain information VTS_PGCI -1 may be displayed, for example, by pressing the MENU button, VTS_PGCI -2--9 may correspond to submenus accessed using the numeric keypad on the remote control, and VTS_PGCI -10 and higher may correspond to additional submenus further down the hierarchy.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, VTS_PGCI -1 may be the top menu displayed by pressing the MENU button, while VTS_PGCI -2 and higher may be voice guidance reproduced by pressing the corresponding numeric key.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      The menus themselves are expressed by the plural program chains defined in this table.
      <br/>
      As a result, the menus may be freely constructed in various ways, and shall not be limited to hierarchical or non-hierarchical menus or menus containing voice guidance.
    </p>
    <p num="154">In the case of a movie, for example, the video title set information VTSI is stored to a buffer in the playback device when playback starts, the playback device references the cell playback sequence described by the program chain PGC, and reproduces the system stream.</p>
    <p num="155">
      The "cells" referenced here may be all or part of the system stream, and are used as access points during playback.
      <br/>
      Cells can therefore be used, for example, as the "chapters" into which a title may be divided.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      Note that each of the PGC information entries C_PBI -j contain both cell playback processing information and a cell information table.
      <br/>
      The cell playback processing information comprises the processing information needed to reproduce the cell, such as the presentation time and number of repetitions.
      <br/>
      More specifically, this information includes the cell block mode CBM, cell block type CBT, seamless playback flag SPF, interleaved allocation flag IAF, STC resetting flag STCDF, cell presentation time C_PBTM, seamless angle change flag SACF, first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA, and the last cell VOBU start address C_LVOBU_SA.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      Note that seamless playback refers to the reproduction in a digital video disk system of multimedia data including video, audio, and sub-picture data without intermittent breaks in the data or information.
      <br/>
      Seamless playback is described in detail in another section below with reference to FIG. 23 and FIG. 24.
    </p>
    <p num="158">
      The cell block mode CBM indicates whether plural cells constitute one functional block.
      <br/>
      The cell playback information of each cell in a functional block is arranged consecutively in the PGC information.
      <br/>
      The cell block mode CBM of the first cell playback information in this sequence contains the value of the first cell in the block, and the cell block mode CBM of the last cell playback information in this sequence contains the value of the last cell in the block.
      <br/>
      The cell block mode CBM of each cell arrayed between these first and last cells contains a value indicating that the cell is a cell between these first and last cells in that block.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      The cell block type CBT identifies the type of the block indicated by the cell block mode CBM.
      <br/>
      For example, when a multiple angle function is enabled, the cell information corresponding to each of the reproducible angles is programmed as one of the functional blocks mentioned above, and the type of these functional blocks is defined by a value identifying "angle" in the cell block type CBT for each cell in that block.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      The seamless playback flag SPF simply indicates whether the corresponding cell is to be linked and played back seamlessly with the cell or cell block reproduced immediately therebefore.
      <br/>
      To seamlessly reproduce a given cell with the preceding cell or cell block, the seamless playback flag SPF is set to 1 in the cell playback information for that cell; otherwise SPF is set to 0.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      The interleaved allocation flag IAF stores a value identifying whether the cell exists in a contiguous or interleaved block.
      <br/>
      If the cell is part of an interleaved block, the flag IAF is set to 1; otherwise it is set to 0.
    </p>
    <p num="162">The STC resetting flag STCDF identifies whether the system time clock STC used for synchronization must be reset when the cell is played back; when resetting the system time clock STC is necessary, the STC resetting flag STCDF is set to 1.</p>
    <p num="163">
      The seamless angle change flag SACF stores a value indicating whether a cell in a multi-angle period should be connected seamlessly at an angle change.
      <br/>
      If the angle change is seamless, the seamless angle change flag SACF is set to 1; otherwise it is set to 0.

    <p num="164">The cell presentation time C_PBTM expresses the cell presentation time with video frame precision.</p>
    <p num="165">The first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA is the VOBU start address of the first cell in a block, and is also expressed as the distance from the logic sector of the first cell in the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) as measured by the number of sectors.</p>
    <p num="166">
      The last cell VOBU start address C_LVOBU_SA is the VOBU start address of the last cell in the block.

      The VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS), i.e., the multimedia system stream data, is described next.

      The system stream data VTSTT_VOBS comprises i (where i is a natural number) system streams SS, each of which is referred to as a "video object" (VOB).
      <br/>
      Each video object VOB -1-VOB -i comprises at least one video data block interleaved with up to a maximum eight audio data blocks and up to a maximum 32 sub-picture data blocks.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      Each video object VOB comprises q (where q is a natural number) cells C-1-C-q.

    <p num="169">
      Each video object unit VOBU comprises plural groups_of_pictures GOP, and the audio and sub-pictures corresponding to the playback of said plural groups_of_pictures GOP.
      <br/>
      Note that the group_of_pictures GOP corresponds to the video encoding refresh cycle.
      <br/>
      Each video object unit VOBU also starts with an NV pack, i.e., the control data for that VOBU.
    </p>
    <p num="170">The structure of the navigation packs NV is described with reference to FIG. 18.</p>
    <p num="171">
      Before describing the navigation pack NV, the internal structure of the video zone VZ (see FIG. 22), i.e., the system stream St35 encoded by the authoring encoder EC described with reference to FIG. 25, is described with reference to FIG. 17. Note that the encoded video stream St15 shown in FIG. 17 is the compressed one-dimensional video data stream encoded by the video encoder 300.
      <br/>
      The encoded audio stream St19 is likewise the compressed one-dimensional audio data stream multiplexing the right and left stereo audio channels encoded by the audio encoder 700.
      <br/>
      Note that the audio signal shall not be limited to a stereo signal, and may also be a multichannel surround-sound signal.
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      The system stream (title editing unit VOB) St35 is a one dimensional array of packs with a byte size corresponding to the logic sectors LS -n having a 2048-byte capacity as described using FIG. 21. A stream control pack is placed at the beginning of the title editing unit (VOB) St35, i.e., at the beginning of the video object unit VOBU.
      <br/>
      This stream control pack is called the "navigation pack NV", and records the data arrangement in the system stream and other control information.
    </p>
    <p num="173">
      The encoded video stream St15 and the encoded audio stream St19 are packetized in byte units corresponding to the system stream packs.
      <br/>
      These packets are shown in FIG. 17 as packets V1, V2, V3, V4 . . . and A1, A2, A3 . . . . As shown in FIG. 17, these packets are interleaved in the appropriate sequence as system stream St35, thus forming a packet stream, with consideration given to the decoder buffer size and the time required by the decoder to expand the video and audio data packets.
      <br/>
      In the example shown in FIG. 17, the packet stream is interleaved in the sequence V1, V2, A1, V3, V4, A2 . . . .
    </p>
    <p num="174">
      Note that the sequence shown in FIG. 17 interleaves one video data unit with one audio data unit.
      <br/>
      Significantly increased recording/playback capacity, high speed recording/playback, and performance improvements in the signal processing LSI enable the DVD system to record plural audio data and plural sub-picture data (graphics data) to one video data unit in a single interleaved MPEG system stream, and thereby enable the user to select the specific audio data and sub-picture data to be reproduced during playback.
      <br/>
      The structure of the system stream used in this type of DVD system is shown in FIG. 18 and described below.
    </p>
    <p num="175">
      As in FIG. 17, the packetized encoded video stream St15 is shown in FIG. 18 as V1, V2, V3, V4, . . . In this example, however, there is not just one encoded audio stream St19, but three encoded audio streams St19A, St19B, and St19C input as the source data.
      <br/>
      There are also two encoded sub-picture streams St17A and St17B input as the source data sub-picture streams.
      <br/>
      These six compressed data streams, St15, St19A, St19B, St19C, St17A and St17B, are interleaved to a single system stream St35.
    </p>
    <p num="176">
      The video data is encoded according to the MPEG specification with the group_of_pictures GOP being the unit of compression.
      <br/>
      In general, each group_of_pictures GOP contains 15 frames in the case of an NTSc signal, but the specific number of frames compressed to one GOP is variable.
      <br/>
      The stream management pack, which describes the management data containing, for example, the relationship between interleaved data, is also interleaved at the GOP unit interval.
      <br/>
      Because the group_of_pictures GOP unit is based on the video data, changing the number of video frames per GOP unit changes the interval of the stream management packs.
      <br/>
      This interval is expressed in terms of the presentation time on the digital video disk within a range from 0.4 sec. to 1.0 sec. referenced to the GOP unit.
      <br/>
      If the presentation time of contiguous plural GOP units is less than 1 sec., the management data packs for the video data of the plural GOP units is interleaved to a single stream.
    </p>
    <p num="177">
      These management data packs are referred to as navigation packs NV in the digital video disk system.
      <br/>
      The data from one navigation pack NV to the packet immediately preceding the next navigation pack NV forms one video object unit VOBU.
      <br/>
      In general, one contiguous playback unit that can be defined as one scene is called a video object VOB, and each video object VOB contains plural video object units VOBU.
      <br/>
      Data sets of plural video objects VOB form a VOB set (VOBS).
      <br/>
      Note that these data units were first used in the digital video disk.
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      When plural of these data streams are interleaved, the navigation packs NV defining the relationship between the interleaved packs must also be interleaved at a defined unit known as the pack number unit.
      <br/>
      Each group_of_pictures GOP is normally a unit containing approximately 0. 5 sec. of video data, which is equivalent to the presentation time required for 12-15 frames, and one navigation pack NV is generally interleaved with the number of data packets required for this presentation time.
    </p>
    <p num="179">
      The stream management information contained in the interleaved video, audio, and sub-picture data packets constituting the system stream is described below with reference to FIG. 19 As shown in FIG. 19, the data contained in the system stream is recorded in a format packed or packetized according to the MPEG2 standard.
      <br/>
      The packet structure is essentially the same for video, audio, and sub-picture data. one pack in the digital video disk system has a 2048 byte capacity as described above, and contains a pack header PKH and one packet PES; each packet PES contains a packet header PTH and data block.
    </p>
    <p num="180">
      The pack header PKH records the time at which that pack is to be sent from stream buffer 2400 to system decoder 2500 (see FIG. 26), i.e., the system clock reference SCR defining the reference time for synchronized audio-visual data playback.
      <br/>
      The MPEG standard assumes that the system clock reference SCR is the reference clock for the entire decoder operation.
      <br/>
      With such disk media as the digital video disk, however, time management specific to individual disk players can be used, and a reference clock for the decoder system is therefore separately provided.
    </p>
    <p num="181">
      The packet header PTH similarly contains a presentation time stamp PTS and a decoding time stamp DTS, both of which are placed in the packet before the access unit (the decoding unit).
      <br/>
      The presentation time stamp PTS defines the time at which the video data or audio data contained in the packet should be output as the playback output after being decoded, and the decoding time stamp DTS defines the time at which the video stream should be decoded.
      <br/>
      Note that the presentation time stamp PTS effectively defines the display start timing of the access unit, and the decoding time stamp DTS effectively defines the decoding start timing of the access unit.
      <br/>
      If the PTS and DTS are the same time, the DTS is omitted.

      Private packets under the MPEG2 standard are data packets of which the content can be freely defined.

      Private packet 1 in this embodiment of the invention is used to carry audio data other than the MPEG audio data, and sub-picture data; private packet 2 carries the PCI packet and DSI packet.

      Private packets 1 and 2 each comprise a packet header, private data area, and data area.

      The audio data defined by private packet 2 may be defined as any of eight types -0--7 of linear PCM or AC-3 encoded data.

      MPEG2-compressed video data may be compressed by constant bit rate (CBR) or variable bit rate (VBR) coding.
      <br/>
      With constant bit rate coding, the video stream is input continuously to the video buffer at a constant rate.
      <br/>
      This contrasts with variable bit rate coding in which the video stream is input intermittently to the video buffer, thereby making it possible to suppress the generation of unnecessary code.
      <br/>
      Both constant bit rate and variable bit rate coding can be used in the digital video disk system.

    <p num="187">
      Because MPEG video data is compressed with variable length coding, the data quantity in each group_of_pictures GOP is not constant.

      The method of time-base synchronizing the video and audio data is therefore described in detail below with reference to FIG. 26, but is described briefly below based on constant bit rate coding.

    <p num="204">
      A preferred embodiment of a digital video disk system authoring encoder ECD in which the multimedia bitstream authoring system according to the present invention is applied to a digital video disk system is described below and shown in FIG. 25 it will be obvious that the authoring encoder ECD applied to the digital video disk system, referred to below as a DVD encoder, is substantially identical to the authoring encoder EC shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The basic difference between these encoders is the replacement in the DVD encoder ECD of the video zone formatter 1300 of the authoring encoder EC above with a VOB buffer 1000 and formatter 1100.
      <br/>
      It will also be obvious that the bitstream encoded by this DVD encoder ECD is recorded to a digital video disk medium M. The operation of this DVD encoder ECD is therefore described below in comparison with the authoring encoder EC described above.
    </p>
    <p num="205">
      As in the above authoring encoder EC, the encoding system controller 200 generates control signals St9, St11, St13, St21, St23, St25, St33, and St39 based on the scenario data St7 describing the user-defined editing instructions input from the scenario editor 100, and controls the video encoder 300, sub-picture encoder 500, and audio encoder 700 in the DVD encoder ECD.
      <br/>
      Note that the user-defined editing instructions in the DVD encoder ECD are a superset of the editing instructions of the authoring encoder EC described above.
    </p>
    <p num="206">
      Specifically, the user-defined editing instructions (scenario data St7) in the DVD encoder ECD similarly describe what source data is selected from all or a subset of the source data containing plural titles within a defined time period, and how the selected source data is reassembled to reproduce the scenario (sequence) intended by the user.
      <br/>
      The scenario data St7 of the DVD encoder ECD, however, further contains such information as: the number of streams contained in the editing units, which are obtained by splitting a multi-title source stream into blocks at a constant time interval; the number of audio and sub-picture data cells contained in each stream, and the sub-picture display time and period; whether the title is a multi-rated title enabling parental lock control; whether the user content is selected from plural streams including, for example, multiple viewing angles; and the method of connecting scenes when the angle is switched among the multiple viewing angles.
    </p>
    <p num="207">
      The scenario data St7 of the DVD encoder ECD also contains control information on a video object VOB unit basis.
      <br/>
      This information is required to encode the media source stream, and specifically includes such information as whether there are multiple angles or parental control features.
      <br/>
      When multiple angle viewing is enabled, the scenario data St7 also contains the encoding bit rate of each stream considering data interleaving and the disk capacity, the start and end times of each control, and whether a seamless connection should be made between the preceding and following streams.
    </p>
    <p num="208">
      The encoding system controller 200 extracts this information from the scenario data St7, and generates the encoding information table and encoding parameters required for encoding control.
      <br/>
      The encoding information table and encoding parameters are described with reference to FIGS. 27, 28, and 29 below.
    </p>
    <p num="209">
      The stream encoding data St33 contains the system stream encoding parameters and system encoding start and end timing values required by the DVD system to generate the VOBS.
      <br/>
      These system stream encoding parameters include the conditions for connecting one video object VOB with those before and after, the number of audio streams, the audio encoding information and audio Ids, the number of sub-pictures and the sub-picture Ids, the video playback starting time information VPTS, and the audio playback starting time information APTS.

    <p num="210">The title sequence control signal St39 supplies the multimedia bitstream MBS formatting start and end timing information and formatting parameters declaring the reproduction control information and interleave information.</p>
    <p num="211">
      Based on the video encoding parameter and encoding start/end timing signal St9, the video encoder 300 encodes a specific part of the video stream St1 to generate an elementary stream conforming to the MPEG2 Video standard defined in ISO-13818.
      <br/>
      This elementary stream is output to the video stream buffer 400 as encoded video stream St15.
    </p>
    <p num="212">Note that while the video encoder 300 generates an elementary stream conforming to the MPEG2 Video standard defined in IS0-13818, specific encoding parameters are input via the video encoding parameter signal St9, including the encoding start and end timing, bit rate, the encoding conditions for the encoding start and end, the material type, including whether the material is an NTSC or PAL video signal or telecine converted material, and whether the encoding mode is set for either open GOP or closed GOP encoding.</p>
    <p num="213">
      The MPEG2 coding method is basically an interframe coding method using the correlation between frames for maximum signal compression, i.e., the frame being coded (the target frame) is coded by referencing frames before and/or after the target frame.
      <br/>
      However, intra-coded frames, i. e., frames that are coded based solely on the content of the target frame, are also inserted to avoid error propagation and enable accessibility from mid-stream (random access).
      <br/>
      The coding unit containing at least one intra-coded frame ("intra-frame") is called a group_of_pictures GOP.
    </p>
    <p num="214">
      A group_of_pictures GOP in which coding is closed completely within that GOP is known as a "closed GOP. " A group_of_pictures GOP containing a frame coded with reference to a frame in a preceding or following (IS0-13818 DOES NOT LIMIT P- and B-picture CODING to referencing PAST frames) group_of_pictures GOP is an "open GOP." It is therefore possible to playback a closed GOP using only that GOP.
      <br/>
      Reproducing an open GOP, however, also requires the presence of the referenced GOP, generally the GOP preceding the open GOP.
    </p>
    <p num="215">
      The GOP is often used as the access unit.
      <br/>
      For example, the GOP may be used as the playback start point for reproducing a title from the middle, as a transition point in a movie, or for fast-forward play and other special reproduction modes.
      <br/>
      High speed reproduction can be achieved in such cases by reproducing only the intra-frame coded frames in a GOP or by reproducing only frames in GOP units.

      Based on the instructions contained in the decoding signal St69, the system decoder 2500 respectively outputs the video, sub-picture, and audio bitstreams input from the stream buffer 2400 to the video buffer 2600, sub-picture buffer 2700, and audio buffer 2800 as the encoded video stream St71, encoded sub-picture stream St73, and encoded audio stream St75.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the stream ID input from the scenario selector 2100 and the pack ID input from the stream buffer 2400 match, the system decoder 2500 outputs the corresponding packs to the respective buffers (i.e., the video buffer 2600, sub-picture buffer 2700, and audio buffer 2800).

      The system decoder 2500 detects the presentation time stamp PTS and decoding time stamp DTS of the smallest control unit in each bitstream St67 to generate the time information signal St77.

      In FIG. 21, scenes 1, 5, and 8 are the common scenes of the basic scene periods.

      VTS_PGC-l describing the scenario 1 consists of cell playback information C_PBI-1 corresponding to scene 1, C_PBI-2, C_PBI-3, and C_PBI-4 within a multi-angle cell block, C_PBI-5 corresponding to scene 5, C_PBI-6 corresponding to scene 6, and C_PBI-7 corresponding to scene 8.

      <br/>
      According to the digital video system data structure, a scene which is a control unit of a scenario is described as a cell which is a unit thereunder, thus a scenario requested by a user can be obtained.

      In FIG. 31, the case that a scenario requested by the user shown in FIG. 21 is shown with respect to a VOB data construction VTSTT_VOBS.
      <br/>
      As specifically shown in FIG. 31, the two scenarios 1 and 2 use the same VOB data in common.
      <br/>
      With respect to a single scene commonly owned by each scenario, VOB-1 corresponding to scene 1, VOB-5 corresponding to scene 5, and VOB-8 corresponding to scene 8 are arranged in non-interleaved block which is the contiguous block.

    <p num="264">
      The seamless playback capability briefly mentioned above with regard to the digital video disk system data structure is described below.
      <br/>
      Note that seamless playback refers to the reproduction in a digital video disk system of multimedia data including video, audio, and sub-picture data without intermittent breaks in the data or information between basic scene periods, between basic scene periods and multi-scene periods, and between multi-scene periods.
    </p>
    <p num="265">Hardware factors contributing to intermittent playback of this data and title content include decoder underflow, i.e., an imbalance between the source data input speed and the decoding speed of the input source data.</p>
    <p num="266">
      Other factors relate to the properties of the playback data.
      <br/>
      When the playback data is data that must be continuously reproduced for a constant time unit in order for the user to understand the content or information, e.g., audio data, data continuity is lost when the required continuous presentation time cannot be assured.
      <br/>
      Reproduction of such information whereby the required continuity is assured is referred to as "contiguous information reproduction," or "seamless information reproduction." Reproduction of this information when the required continuity cannot be assured is referred to as "non-continuous information reproduction," or "non-seamless information reproduction." It is obvious that continuous information reproduction and non-continuous information reproduction are, respectively, seamless and non-seamless reproduction.
    </p>
    <p num="267">
      Note that seamless reproduction can be further categorized as seamless data reproduction and seamless information reproduction.
      <br/>
      Seamless data reproduction is defined as preventing physical blanks or interruptions in the data playback (intermittent reproduction) as a result of a buffer underflow state, for example.
      <br/>
      Seamless information reproduction is defined as preventing apparent interruptions in the information when perceived by the user (intermittent presentation) when recognizing information from the playback data where there are no actual physical breaks in the data reproduction.

      The DVD data system streams described above are recorded using an appropriate authoring encoder EC as a movie or other multimedia title on a DVD recording medium.
      <br/>
      Note that the following description refers to a movie as the multimedia title being processed, but it will be obvious that the invention shall not be so limited.
    </p>
    <p num="270">
      Supplying a single movie in a format enabling the movie to be used in plural different cultural regions or countries requires the script to be recorded in the various languages used in those regions or countries.
      <br/>
      It may even necessitate editing the content to conform to the mores and moral expectations of different cultures.
      <br/>
      Even using such a large-capacity storage system as the DVD system, however, it is necessary to reduce the bit rate, and therefore the image quality, if plural full-length titles edited from a single common source title are recorded to a single disk.
      <br/>
      This problem can be solved by recording the common parts of plural titles only once, and recording the segments different in each title for each different title only.
      <br/>
      This method makes it possible to record plural titles for different countries or cultures to a single optical disk without reducing the bit rate, and, therefore, retaining high image quality.
    </p>
    <p num="271">As shown in FIG. 21, the titles recorded to a single optical disk contain basic scene periods of scenes common to all scenarios, and multi-scene periods containing scenes specific to certain scenarios, to provide parental lock control and multi-angle scene control functions.</p>
    <p num="272">
      In the case of the parental lock control function, titles containing sex scenes, violent scenes, or other scenes deemed unsuitable for children, i.e., so-called "adult scenes," are recorded with a combination of common scenes, adult scenes, and children's scenes.
      <br/>
      These title streams are achieved by arraying the adult and children's scenes to multi-scene periods between the common basic scene periods.
    </p>
    <p num="273">
      Multi-angle control can be achieved in a conventional single-angle title by recording plural multimedia scenes obtained by recording the subjects from the desired plural camera angles to the multi-scene periods arrayed between the common basic scene periods.
      <br/>
      Note, however, that while these plural scenes are described here as scenes recorded from different camera angles (positions), it will be obvious that the scenes may be recorded from the same camera angle but at different times, data generated by computer graphics, or other video data.
    </p>
    <p num="274">
      When data is shared between different scenarios of a single title, it is obviously necessary to move the laser beam LS from the common scene data to the non-common scene data during reproduction, i.e., to move the optical pickup to a different position on the DVD recording medium RC1.
      <br/>
      The problem here is that the time required to move the optical pickup makes it difficult to continue reproduction without creating breaks in the audio or video, i.e., to sustain seamless reproduction.
      <br/>
      This problem can be theoretically solved by providing a track buffer (stream buffer 2400) to delay data output an amount equivalent to the worst access time.
      <br/>
      In general, data recorded to an optical disk is read by the optical pickup, appropriately processed, and temporarily stored to the track buffer.
      <br/>
      The stored data is subsequently decoded and reproduced as video or audio data.
    </p>
    <p num="275">The operation of the stream buffer 2400, or a track buffer, in this DVD system is described briefly below.</p>
    <p num="276">
      Because rotational speed control of the optical disk drive cannot instantaneously adjust the disk speed, the input to the stream buffer 2400, i.e., the transfer rate Vr from the optical disk, is a basically constant rate.
      <br/>
      Output from the track buffer, i.e., the transfer rate Vo to the decoder, however, varies according to the image quality, user intent, and even the variable bit rate of the compressed video data in the DVD system.
      <br/>
      The from-disk transfer rate Vr is therefore constant at approximately 11 Mbps in the DVD system, while the transfer rate Vo from the buffer is variable to a maximum 10 Mbps.
    </p>
    <p num="277">
      Because of this gap between the input and output transfer rates Vr and Vo, the stream buffer 2400 will overflow if data is transferred continuously from disk.
      <br/>
      Therefore, to prevent the stream buffer 2400 of the reproduction apparatus overflowing, data is transferred intermittently from the disk.
      <br/>
      The stream buffer is controlled during normal continuous reproduction to always be in a near-overflow state.
    </p>
    <p num="278">
      It is therefore possible by using a stream buffer 2400 to sustain continuous, uninterrupted data output (reproduction) even if there is a slight break in data reading as a result of the read head (optical pickup) 2006 jumping to move between logic sectors LS on the disk.
      <br/>
      In an actual reproduction apparatus, however, the jump time may vary between 200 msec and 2 sec depending upon the distance and position on the disk M. While it is possible to use a stream buffer 2400 with capacity sufficient to absorb this jump time, the compression bit rate is an average 4-5 Mbps and a maximum 10 Mbps when using a large-capacity optical disk M storing high quality images.
      <br/>
      Assuring seamless reproduction when jumping from any disk position to any other with this system imposes significant memory requirements, resulting in an expensive decoder DC.
      <br/>
      Because the amount of memory that can be built in to the decoder DC is therefore limited if a cost-effective product is to be marketed, other limitations are imposed, e. g., limiting the jump time to a time whereby data can be continuously reproduced.
    </p>
    <p num="279">
      The relationship between the accumulated data quantity in the stream buffer 2400 and the operating mode of the reading head 2006 is shown in FIG. 32. In FIG. 32, period Tr is the period during which the optical pickup reads data from the optical disk RC, and period Tj is the jump period during which the optical pickup moves between logic sectors.
      <br/>
      Line L1 expresses the change in data volume Vd stored in the stream buffer 2400 during the data read period Tr.

      Line L2 expresses the change in data volume Vd stored in the stream buffer 2400 during the jump period Tj.
    </p>
    <p num="280">
      During the data read period Tr, the reading head 2006 reads data from the optical disk M at the transfer rate Vr, and stores the read data directly to the stream buffer 2400.
      <br/>
      The stream buffer 2400 supplies the data to the decoders 3801, 3100, and :3200 at the transfer rate Vo.
      <br/>
      As a result, data accumulates in the stream buffer 2400 during the data read period Tr at the rate Vr-Vo, i.e., the difference between these two transfer rates.
    </p>
    <p num="281">
      Because the reading head 2006 is moving to access a different disk position during the jump period Tj, data read from the optical disk M cannot be stored to the stream buffer 2400.
      <br/>
      Data continues to be output from the stream buffer 2400 to the decoders 3801, 3100, and 3200 during this period, however, and the accumulated data volume Vd remaining in the stream buffer 2400 decreases at the rate at which data is transferred to the) decoders, i.e., transfer rate Vo.
    </p>
    <p num="282">
      Note that while the transfer rate Vo to the decoders is shown in FIG. 32 as a constant rate, data transfers to the decoders actually occur intermittently because the decoding time varies according to the data type.
      <br/>
      These differences are omitted to simply this description of the buffer underflow concept.
      <br/>
      This is equivalent to the reading head 2006 reading data intermittently during the jump period Tj, even through the reading head 2006 continuously reads from the optical disk M at a constant linear velocity (CLV).
      <br/>
      The slopes Li and L2 of lines L1 and L2 above can be expressed by the following equations.
    </p>
    <p num="283">

      Underflow occurs, and decoding stops, when the jump period Tj is long enough for stream buffer 2400 to empty.
      <br/>
      If the jump period Tj is held to less than the time required for the stream buffer 2400 to empty, however, decoding can continue without data interruptions.
      <br/>
      This time at which the reading head 2006 can jump to another disk position without a data underflow state occurring in the stream buffer 2400 is referred to as the jump-enabled time.

    <p num="285">
      Note that while physical movement of the reading head 2006 has been described as a factor causing a data underflow state in the stream buffer 2400, the following factors also contribute.
      <br/>
      Note, further, that this data underflow state can be simply characterized as a condition in which data input to the track buffer (stream buffer 2400) does not keep pace with data output from the track buffer.
    </p>
    <p num="286">
      a) The buffer is too small relative to the decoding speed of the decoder.
      <br/>
      b) The sizes of the individual input units of the plural VOB types carried in the reproduced bitstream St61 input to the stream buffer 2400 from the bitstream producer 2000 are inappropriate for the buffer size.
      <br/>
      c) The sequence of the individual input units of the plural VOB types carried in the reproduced bitstream St61 is inappropriate for the decoding speed, resulting in the next data unit to be decoded not being received in sufficient time while decoding a particular data unit.

      When the reproducing apparatus of the digital video disk system is configured with a disk read rate of 11 Mbps, a maximum AV data compression rate of 10 Mbps, and a track buffer (stream buffer 2400) capacity of 4 Mbits, for example, a data underflow state will occur.
      <br/>
      To prevent this data underflow state from occurring during the jump period Tj in a reproduction apparatus, thus configured with slight overflow control maintained during normal continuous playback, a maximum jump-enabled time of 400 msec can be assured even in a worst-case scenario where 10 Mbps of AV data is reproduced during the jump period.
    </p>
    <p num="288">
      Note that a jump-enabled time of 400 msec is a realistic value that can be achieved in actual reproduction apparatuses.
      <br/>
      In such an apparatus the distance that can be jumped during a 400 msec period is approximately 500 tracks.
      <br/>
      It follows that the jump-enabled time can also be defined in data quantity terms, specifically the volume of the sequential data stream that the reading head 2006 can move through within the jump-enabled time.
      <br/>
      The data volume equivalent to a 400 msec jump-enabled time is approximately 250 Mbits.
      <br/>
      It will also be obvious that the actual distance in sector and track units on the recording medium can also be easily obtained from the data volume defined as the jumpable distance based on the recording method and density of the recording medium.
    </p>
    <p num="289">
      A 250-Mbit jumpable distance is equivalent to a 50 sec. presentation time assuming AV data reproduced at an average 5 Mbits/sec.
      <br/>
      With even higher quality AV data, the presentation time is less than 50 sec.
      <br/>
      In movies and other data streams edited to remove particular scenes due to cultural, educational, or other reasons, the excised scenes are typically long, usually ranging from 2 to 5 minutes, and even as long as 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      If the excised scene lasts 5 minutes, for example, with the above reproduction apparatus, it is not possible to uninterruptedly connect the scenes before and after an excised scene if the before scene, excised scene, and after scene are recorded to disk in a single contiguous series.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the data corresponding to a continuous 5 minute scene cannot be jumped in a single jump operation.
    </p>
    <p num="290">
      There are also cases in which the AV data compression rate, i.e., the consumption rate Vo of data from the track buffer, approaches 10 Mbps and non-occurrence of a buffer underflow state cannot be assured, even when the excised scene data is jumped using a jump period Tj exceeding 400 msec.
      <br/>
      While such a data underflow state can conceivably be avoided by recording two AV data scenarios, i.e., excised (edited) and un-excised (unedited) scenarios, to disk, this method does not make effective use of the available disk capacity.
      <br/>
      If it is also necessary to record duplicate data for much presentation time, the AV data will be low quality and it will be difficult to satisfy most user expectations.

      Note that while there appears to be a time gap between the data blocks in FIG. 33, this is simply to facilitate the use of arrows in the figure for easier description of the data reproduction paths.
      <br/>
      There is no actual time gap during playback.
    </p>
    <p num="292">
      The format whereby these data blocks DbA, DbB, DbC, and DbD are recorded to disk in title TL1_2 to enable contiguous reproduction of the data is shown in FIG. 34. In principle, data blocks DbA, DbB, DbC, and DbD composing a single contiguous title are recorded to contiguous segments of the data recording track TR (FIG. 9).
      <br/>
      Thus, data DbA, DbB, and DbD of first title TL1 are first recorded contiguously, and are followed by data DbC unique to the second title TL2.
      <br/>
      With this data format, the first title TL1 can be contiguously reproduced without breaks in the title content, i.e., seamlessly, by means of controlling the reading head 2006 to access data DbA, DbB, and DbD synchronized to playback periods T1, T2, and T3, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="293">
      To reproduce the second title TL2, however, the reading head 2006 must jump past (data DbB and DbD after reproducing data DbA in period T1, and must reach data DbC before the start of period T2 as shown by arrow Sq2a in FIG. 34. Then after reproducing data DbC, the reading head 2006 must jump back to data units DibC and DbD as shown by arrow Sq2b, and reach data DbD before the start of period T3.
      <br/>
      Because of the time required to) move the reading head 2006 between data blocks, it is not possible to assure seamless reproduction between data DbA and DbC, and between DbC and DbD, unless the distance travelled between these data blocks requires less time than the time required for a data underflow state to occur in the stream buffer 2400.
    </p>
    <p num="294">
      To thus enable the user to selectively excise scenes and choose from among plural scenes, a state wherein non-selected scene data is recorded inserted between common scene data and selective scene data necessarily occurs because the data units associated with individual scenes are contiguously recorded to the recording tracks of the recording medium.
      <br/>
      If data is then read in the recorded sequence, non-selected scene data must be accessed before accessing and decoding the selected scene data, and seamless connections with the selected scene is difficult.
      <br/>
      The excellent random access characteristics of the digital video disk system, however, make seamless connections with the selected scenes possible.
    </p>
    <p num="295">
      In other words, by splitting scene-specific data into plural units of a specified data size, and interleaving plural split data units for different scenes in a predefined sequence that is recorded to disk within the jumping range whereby an data underflow state does not occur, it is possible to reproduce the selected scenes without data interruptions by intermittently accessing and decoding the data specific to the selected scenes using these split data units.
      <br/>
      Seamless data reproduction is thereby assured.
    </p>
    <p num="296">The seamless connection method and data splitting and arraying concepts of the present invention are described below using the track buffer input transfer rate Vr and data consumption rate Vo described above.</p>
    <p num="297">
      Referring again to FIG. 32, the data consumption rate Vo is less than the transfer rate Vr (Vr&gt;Vo).
      <br/>
      Using this difference, a known data volume is read at the transfer rate Vr, buffered to the track buffer and stored, and is then consumed (output to the decoder) while the optical pickup moves to the position of the next read data.
      <br/>
      To prevent a data underflow state even after multiple repetitions of this operation, split data units for a defined volume of data for each scene are distributed at an appropriate interval.
      <br/>
      This method of arraying data to assure seamless data reproduction is called "interleaving," the split data units of a size sufficient for buffering to the track buffer are called "interleave units," and the interleave units after interleaving are called "interleaved units."
    </p>
    <p num="298">
      When one scene is selected from plural scenes, interleave units are required for tile plural video objects VOBs composing those plural scenes.
      <br/>
      Two interleaved units ILVU contiguous on the time-base and belonging to the selected scene are separated by one or more interleaved units ILVU belonging to another scene, inserted therebetween.
      <br/>
      The distance between two time-base-contiguous interleaved units ILVU belonging to the same scene is defined as the interleave distance.
    </p>
    <p num="299">
      For example, 260 msec is required to move 10,000 sectors using an optical disk recording medium.
      <br/>
      If this 10,000-sector movement of the optical pickup is the interleave unit distance, the size of the interleaved units ILVU can be determined from the difference between the track buffer input and output transfer rates Vr and Vo, and the size of the track buffer.
      <br/>
      Let us assume, for example, that compressed data is being output at a constant rate using an input transfer rate Vr of 11 Mbps and an output transfer rate Vo of 8 Mbps, and a track buffer capacity of 3 Mbits.
      <br/>
      If the distance between interleaved units ILVU is 10,000 sectors, there must be enough interleaved units ILVU to input to the track buffer to accumulate therein a 260-msec equivalent of playback data before the reading head moves.
    </p>
    <p num="300">
      In general, 2080 Kbits is equivalent to 260 msec of playback data.
      <br/>
      To store this much data to the track buffer before moving between interleaved units ILVU, source data must be input to the track buffer for 0.7 sec. at the difference between transfer rates Vr and Vo (=2080 Kbit/(11-8) Mbits/sec).
      <br/>
      The time needed to read enough source data from the recording medium M to store sufficient data to the track buffer to provide for data consumption by the decoder while the optical pickup is moving to the target interleaved unit ILVU and can resume data reading is defined as the minimum accumulation read time.
    </p>
    <p num="301">
      The minimum interleaved unit size, i.e., the amount of data that must be read, is therefore 7.7 Mbits. Converted to presentation time, this makes it possible to interleave units with a presentation time of 0. 96 sec. or greater with presentation time intervals less than 20 sec. between interleaved units.
      <br/>
      By reducing the system stream consumption bit rate, the minimum accumulation read time can be reduced, and the size of the interleaved units can be reduced.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to increase the jumpable time without changing the interleaved unit size.
    </p>
    <p num="302">
      One method of connecting scenes is shown in FIG. 35 where the following scenarios are possible: scene A connected to scene D; scene A connected to scene B, which is substituted for a certain time segment of scene D; and scene A connected to scene C, which is similarly substituted for a certain time segment of scene D but for a different time segment than scene B. In such cases, scene D is further blocked into scene segments (scenes) D-1, D-2, and D-3.
      <br/>
      The system stream corresponding to scenes B, D-1, C, and D-2 is the output system stream output at transfer rate Vo (=8 Mbps).
      <br/>
      Data is input to the track buffer at transfer rate Vr (=11 Mbps) in the scene sequence B. D-1, C, D-2; the data size of each scene is greater than the above value (=0,96 sec.), and can be arrayed within the distance that can be jumped between connected scenes as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="303">
      However, when scenes with the same starting points but different end points, e.g., scenes B, C, and D in this example, are interleaved, three different system streams become interleaved during the period corresponding to scene D-1, two system streams become interleaved during the period corresponding to scene D-2, and processing tends to become complex.
      <br/>
      It is therefore more common when interleaving plural video objects VOB to interleave objects having the same starting and end points, thus simplifying processing.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished as shown in FIG. 36 by copying and appending scene D-2 to scene C of FIG. 35, thereby unifying the points at which plural scenes diverge and connect, i.e., the starting and end points, with plural interleaved video objects VOB.
      <br/>
      When interleaving branching and connecting scenes in the digital video disk system, therefore, the scenes are interleaved with the starting and end points thereof aligned.
    </p>
    <p num="304">The interleaving concept is described in further detail below.</p>
    <p num="305">
      The audio-video (AV) system stream described above is one example of interleaving with time information.
      <br/>
      This interleaving method arrays audio and video information having the same time-base so that data input to the buffer at approximately the same time is in physical proximity, and data units having approximately the same presentation time are arrayed in alternating sequence.
      <br/>
      When one scene can be replaced with another scene in titles such as movies, however, the time between these plural scenes often differs.
      <br/>
      When the AV system stream interleaving method described above is applied in such cases, the between-scene time difference can be absorbed by the buffer if it is within the jumpable time.
      <br/>
      If the between-scene time difference is greater than the jumpable time, however, the buffer cannot absorb the difference and seamless playback is not possible.
    </p>
    <p num="306">
      If the track buffer size is increased to increase the amount of data that can be accumulated at one time, a longer jumpable time is obtained, and the interleave unit and sequence are more easily determined.
      <br/>
      When interactive operation enabling the user to select from among plural scenes (e.g., multi-angle scenes) with seamless playback, the presentation time of the previous angle stream is increased after the angle (stream) is changed if the interleaved units ILVU are made longer and the amount of data stored at one time is increased.
      <br/>
      This also results in more time being required for the displayed stream to change.
    </p>
    <p num="307">Interleaving is thus the process of optimizing the system stream arrangement in data block units to prevent a data underflow state from occurring in the track buffer of the authoring decoder DC when the encoded data supplied from the stream source is consumed for decoding by the decoder.</p>
    <p num="308">
      A major cause of this data underflow state is the mechanical movement of the optical pickup, though there are lesser factors such as the decoding speed of the communications (decoding) system.
      <br/>
      Mechanical movement of the optical pickup is a problem when the optical pickup scans the data recording track TR of the optical disk M to read data.
      <br/>
      Interleaving is also needed when recording the data to the data recording track TR of the optical disk M. The decoding speed of the communications system can also become a problem when the source stream is supplied directly as occurs with live broadcasts, cable television and other dedicated line transmissions, broadcast satellites and other radio wave transmissions, and other means whereby title content is not reproduced from a recording medium on the user's side.
      <br/>
      In such cases the transmitted source stream must be interleaved.
    </p>
    <p num="309">
      Interleaving can thus be more specifically defined as the process whereby the data carried in a source stream comprising source data groups of plural contiguously input source data blocks is arranged in a particular sequence whereby the desired (targeted) source data can be intermittently and sequentially accessed to contiguously reproduce the information in the targeted source data.
      <br/>
      The duration of these intermittent breaks in the input of the target source data that is to be reproduced is therefore defined as the jump time of the interleave control.
    </p>
    <p num="310">
      It should be noted, hoiwever, that an interleaving method for arraying on a random access disk movies and other common titles containing scene selections that may branch and recombine according to various scenarios in a manner whereby video objects VOB containing video data compressed with variable length coding has not been described.
      <br/>
      When arraying this type of data to disk, a certain amount of trial and error is required using the compressed data.
      <br/>
      This obviously makes it necessary to define an interleaving method for arranging plural video objects in a sequence enabling seamless playback.
    </p>
    <p num="311">
      When applied to a DVD system as described above, these video objects are distributed to positions (navigation packs NV) within a specific time-base range bounded by GOP units, the unit of video data compression.
      <br/>
      The GOP data length, however, may vary as a result of user-defined image manipulation processes or intra-frame coding inserted for higher image quality.
      <br/>
      This means that the location of the management packs (navigation packs NV), which are dependent upon the presentation time, can vary.
      <br/>
      This means that the point at which the scene angle changes or the optical pickup jumps to the next data block in the playback sequence is indefinite.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, if plural scene angles are interleaved together, the length of contiguously read data is indefinite even if the next jump point is known.
      <br/>
      Thus, the data end point position is known only after the next angle data is read, and switching the playback data is thus delayed.
    </p>
    <p num="312">
      The present invention therefore provides a method and apparatus enabling seamless data reproduction using an optical disk having a data structure whereby data is shared between plural titles to efficiently utilize the available optical disk space, and a new function called "multi-angle scene reproduction" is achieved.
      <br/>
      The method and apparatus of the present invention are described below with reference to the accompanying figures.
    </p>
    <p num="313">
      The interleaving method enabling seamless data reproduction according to the present invention is described below with reference to FIG. 24 and FIG. 37. Shown in FIG. 24 is a case from which three scenarios may be derived, i.e., branching from one video object VOB-A to one of plural video objects VOB-B, VOB-C, and VOB-D, and then merging back again to a single video object VOB-E.
      <br/>
      The actual arrangement of these blocks recorded to a data recording track TR on disk is shown in FIG. 37.
    </p>
    <p num="314">
      Referring to FIG. 37, VOB-A and VOB-E are video objects with independent playback start and end times, and are in principle arrayed to contiguous block regions.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 24, the playback start and end times of VOB-B, VOB-C, and VOB-D are aligned during interleaving.
      <br/>
      The interleaved data blocks are then recorded to disk to a contiguous interleaved block region.
      <br/>
      The contiguous block regions and interleaved block regions are then written to disk in the track path Dr direction in the playback sequence.
      <br/>
      Plural video objects VOB, i.e., interleaved video objects VOBS, arrayed to the data recording track TR are shown in FIG. 37.
    </p>
    <p num="315">
      Referring to FIG. 37, data regions to which data is continuously arrayed are called "blocks," of which there are two types: "contiguous block regions" in which VOB with discrete starting and end points are contiguously arrayed, and "interleaved block regions" in which plural VOB with aligned starting and end points are interleaved.
      <br/>
      The respective blocks are arrayed as shown in FIG. 38 in the playback sequence, i.e., block 1, block 2, block 3, . . . block 7.
    </p>
    <p num="316">
      As shown in FIG. 39, the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) consist of blocks 1-7, inclusive.
      <br/>
      Block 1 contains VOB 1 alone.
      <br/>
      Blocks 2, 3, 5, and 7 similarly discretely contain VOBS 2, 3, 6, and 10.
      <br/>
      Blocks 2, 3, 5, and 7 are thus contiguous block regions.
    </p>
    <p num="317">
      Block 4, however, contains VOB 4 and VOB 5 interleaved together, while block 6 contains VOB 7, VOB 8, and VOB 9 interleaved together.
      <br/>
      Blocks 4 and 6 are thus interleaved block regions.
    </p>
    <p num="318">
      The internal data structure of the contiguous block regions is shown in FIG. 39 with VOB-i and VOB-j arrayed as the contiguous blocks in the VOBS.
      <br/>
      As described with reference to FIG. 16, VOB-i and VOB-j inside the contiguous block regions are further logically divided into cells as the playback unit.
      <br/>
      Both VOB-i and VOB-j in this figure are shown comprising three cells CELL -1, CELL -2, and CELL -3.
    </p>
    <p num="319">
      Each cell comprises one or more video object unit VOBU with the video object unit VOBU defining the boundaries of the cell.
      <br/>
      Each cell also contains information identifying the position of the cell in the program chain PGC (the playback control information of the digital video disk system).
      <br/>
      More specifically, this position information is the address of the first and last VOBU in the cell.
      <br/>
      As also shown in FIG. 39, these VOB and the cells defined therein are also recorded to a contiguous block region so that contiguous blocks are contiguously reproduced.
      <br/>
      Reproducing these contiguous blocks is therefore no problem.
    </p>
    <p num="320">
      The internal data structure of the interleaved block regions is shown in FIG. 40. In the interleaved block regions each video object VOB is divided into interleaved units ILVU, and the interleaved units ILVU associated with each VOB are alternately arrayed.
      <br/>
      Cell boundaries are defined independently of the interleaved units ILVU.
      <br/>
      For example, VOB-k is divided into four interleaved units ILVUk1, ILVUk2, ILVUk3, and ILVUk4, and are confined by a single cell CELL-k.
      <br/>
      VOB-k is likewise divided into four interleaved units ILVUm1, ILVUm2, ILVUm3, and ILVUm4, and is confined by a sincle cell CELL-m.
      <br/>
      Note that instead of a single cell CELL-k or CELL-m, each of VOB-k and VOB-m can be divided into more than two cells.
      <br/>
      The interleaved units ILVU thus contains both audio and video data.
    </p>
    <p num="321">
      In the example shown in FIG. 40, the interleaved units ILVUk1, ILVUk2, ILVUk3, and ILVUk4, and ILVUm1, ILVUm2, ILVUm3, and ILVUm4, from two different video objects VOB-k and VOB-m are alternately arrayed within a single interleaved block.
      <br/>
      By interleaving the interleaved units ILVU of two video objects VOB in this sequence, it is possible to achieve seamless reproduction branching from one scene to one of plural scenes, and from one of plural scenes to one scene.
    </p>
    <p num="322">
      This interleaving process further enables seamless reproduction of scenes from various scenario threads in most cases.
      <br/>
      Seamless reproduction is even possible when there are three possible scenario threads as shown in FIG. 35, i.e., from scene A to scene B, and then to scene D-3 starting at some midpoint in scene D; from scene A to the beginning of scene D; and from scene A to scene C, and then to scene D-2 starting at a midpoint in scene D different from D-3.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 36, it is also possible by connecting before and after scenes (scene D-2) to align the starting and end points according to the data structure of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Note that this process of copying scenes to align the starting and end points makes it possible to seamlessly reproduce even complicated threading of different scenes.
    </p>
    <p num="323">An example of an interleaving algorithm compatible with variable length coded data, i.e., video data, is described next.</p>
    <p num="324">
      When plural VOB are interleaved, each VOB is basically divided into the same particular number of interleave units.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to obtain the data volume (size) of each of this particular number of interleave units based on the bit rate of the VOB to be interleaved, the jump time and distance that can be jumped within this jump time, the track buffer capacity and the input rate Vr to the track buffer, and the position of the video object unit VOBU.
      <br/>
      Each interleaved unit consists of video object units VOBU, each of which comprises one or more MPEG GOP with a data quantity equivalent to a 0.4-1.0 second presentation time.
    </p>
    <p num="325">
      When data is interleaved, the interleaved units ILVU forming separate video objects VOB are alternately arrayed.
      <br/>
      If any of the plural interleave units interleaved to the shortest of plural VOB is shorter than the minimum interleave unit length, or if the total length of plural interleave units in any but the shortest of plural VOB, is greater than the shortest interleave distance, an underflow state will occur when this shortest interleave VOB is reproduced, and non-seamless reproduction will result instead of seamless reproduction.
    </p>
    <p num="326">
      Before encoding occurs in the present embodiment it is therefore determined whether interleaving is possible.
      <br/>
      Whether interleaving is possible can be determined from the lengths of the pre-encoded streams.
      <br/>
      Because the effect of interleaving can thus be determined in advance, the need for data reprocessing, i.e., the need to adjust the interleaving conditions and record after interleaving and encoding are once completed, can be prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="327">The interleaving method for recording to an optical disk according to the present invention is described specifically below, starting with the bit rate of the recorded VOB and the performance and other conditions of the reproduced disk.</p>
    <p num="328">
      When interleaving is applied, the relationship between the track buffer input transfer rate Vr and output transfer rate Vo is defined as Vr&gt;Vo as previously described.
      <br/>
      The maximum bit rate of each VOB to be interleaved is therefore set to less than the track buffer input transfer rate Vr.
      <br/>
      The maximum bit rate B of each VOB is therefore set to a value less than Vr.
      <br/>
      If in the evaluation determining whether interleaving enabling seamless reproduction is possible it is assumed that all plural VOB to be interleaved are encoded with constant bit rate (CBR) coding at the maximum bit rate, the interleave unit data volume is maximized, the time that can be reproduced from the data volume that can be placed at the jumpable distance is shortened, and the interleave conditions are stringent.
    </p>
    <p num="329">Note that it is assumed below that each VOB is encoded with constant bit rate (CBR) coding at the maximum bit rate.</p>
    <p num="330">It is assumed in the following description of the reproduction apparatus that the distance the optical pickup can jump within disk jump time JT expressed as a data quantity is jumpable distance JM, and the input data bit rate to the track buffer of the reproduction apparatus is BIT.</p>
    <p num="331">
      In terms of an actual reproduction apparatus, the disk jump time JT is 400 msec, the jumpable distance JM is 250 Mbit in this jump time JT.
      <br/>
      The maximum bit rate B of the VOB in the MPEG system is defined as 8.8 Mbps considering that an average 6 Mbps is required to obtain image quality superior to that of a conventional VCR recording.
    </p>
    <p num="332">
      Based on the jumpable distance JM, jump time JT, -and data read times from disk, the target values for the smallest interleaved unit size ILVUM and the smallest interleave unit presentation time ILVUMT are calculated first.
      <br/>
      The smallest interleave unit presentation time ILVUMT can be obtained from equation 3, and the smallest interleaved unit size ILVUM can be obtained from equation 4 below.
    </p>
    <p num="333">
      ILVUMT &gt;= JT+ILVUM/BIT  �3�
      <br/>
      ILVUMT * B=ILVUM  �4�
    </p>
    <p num="334">From equation 3 the smallest interleave unit presentation time ILVUMT is determined to be 2 sec., and the smallest GOP block data GM is 17.6 Mbit. Thus, if the smallest interleave unit, which is the smallest unit of the data layout, is a 2-sec. equivalent data quantity and each GOP comprises 15 frames (NTSC format), then the smallest interleave unit is equivalent to the data stored in four GOP.</p>
    <p num="335">
      As also stated above, one interleaving condition is that the interleave distance be less than or equal to the jumpable distance.
      <br/>
      This means that except for the VOB with the shortest presentation time, the total presentation time of plural VOB to which interleaving is applied must be shorter than the time that can be reproduced within the interleave distance.
      <br/>
      If as in the above example the jumpable distance JM is 250 Mbit and the maximum VOB bit rate is 8.8 Mbps, the time JMT that can be reproduced with the data quantity read within the jumpable distance JM is 28.4 sec. It is then possible to calculate an interleavable conditions equation using these values.
      <br/>
      If each VOB in the interleaved block region is divided into the same number of interleaved block and this number of interleaved divisions is v, equation 5 can be obtained from the conditions of the smallest interleave unit length.
      <br/>
      (presentation time of shortest VOB)/ILVUMT &lt;= v�5�
    </p>
    <p num="336">
      Equation 6 can then also be obtained from the jumpable presentation time conditions.

      v &lt;= (presentation time of all VOB except shortest VOB)/JMT  �6�
    </p>
    <p num="337">
      Plural VOB can in principle be interleaved if the above conditions are fulfilled.
      <br/>
      In practical terms, VOBU compensation to the value calculated according to the above equations is necessary because the interleave units are limited to the VOBU boundaries.
      <br/>
      To compensate equations 2, 3, and 4, it is necessary to add the maximum VOBU time (1. 0 sec.) to the smallest interleave unit presentation time ILVUMT, and reduce the presentation time in the interleave distance JMT by the maximum VOBU time.
    </p>
    <p num="338">
      If it is determined that an interleaved sequence enabling seamless playback is not possible as a result of calculating the conditions for interleaving the VOB scenes before encoding, it is necessary to increase the number of interleave unit divisions.
      <br/>
      This means increasing the length of the scene forming the shortest VOB by moving the scene therebefore or after.
      <br/>
      It is also necessary to add the same scene added to the shortest scene to the other scenes.
      <br/>
      In general, the interleave distance is significantly greater than the shortest interleave unit, and the rate of increase in the value on the left side of equation 4 is greater than the increase in the value on the right side of equation 6.
      <br/>
      As a result, increasing the size of the shifted (moved) scene can result in satisfying the above conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="339">
      The track buffer input transfer rate Vr and output transfer rate Vo must be in the relationship Vr&gt;Vo as described above for the data in the interleaved blocks.
      <br/>
      The optical pickup may also jump immediately after entering an interleaved block region from a contiguous block region, in which case it is also necessary to store the data from immediately before the interleaved block region.
      <br/>
      This makes it necessary to suppress the bit rate of part of the data in the VOB immediately before the interleaved block region.
    </p>
    <p num="340">
      It is also possible that the optical pickup may jump immediately after entering an interleaved block from a contiguous block, in which case it is necessary to suppress the maximum bit rate of the contiguous block immediately before the interleaved block, and store the data from immediately before the interleaved block to the track buffer.
      <br/>
      The target for suppressing the maximum bit rate, i.e., the amount the maximum bit rate is suppressed, is the presentation time of the shortest interleave unit, which can be calculated from the maximum bit rate of the interleaved block reproduced after the contiguous block.
    </p>
    <p num="341">Note that while the above operation has assumed that all VOB are divided into the same number of interleave units, it is also possible to group the VOB into a group of VOB containing u divisions (interleave units) and a group of VOB containing u+1 divisions when there is a significant difference in VOB length.</p>
    <p num="342">
      This can be accomplished by defining the minimum number of divisions in each VOB obtained from equation 5 as u and using this value u for all VOB from which a greater number of interleave units cannot be obtained, and using the number of interleave units obtained from equation 4 up to (u +1) for larger VOB.
      <br/>
      This is illustrated in FIG. 41.
    </p>
    <p num="343">
      The data structure of the interleaved unit ILVU in another embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. 42. In. this structure the navigation pack NV described with reference to FIG. 20 is placed at the beginning of each video object unit VOBU, and the data from one navigation pack NV to immediately before the next navigation pack NV is defined as one video object unit VOBU.
      <br/>
      The video object unit VOBU boundaries determine the boundaries of the interleaved unit ILVU, each of which is longer than the length of the shortest interleaved unit, which is obtained from the decoder performance, bit rate, and other considerations using equations 5 and 6.
    </p>
    <p num="344">
      Each of the component video object units VOBU contains a navigation pack NV (management information pack), each navigation pack NV containing an ILVU end pack address ILVU_EA indicating the address of the last pack in the ILVU to which the VOBU belongs, and the next--ILVU start address NT_ILVU_SA.
      <br/>
      The position to which the start address NT_ILVU_SA points is the address of the first pack (NV) in the next interleaved unit ILVU to be reproduced, while the ILVU end pack address ILVU_EA points to the end position of the interleaved unit ILVU containing the end pack address ILVU_EA.
      <br/>
      Note that as previously described these addresses are expressed as the number of sectors from the navigation pack NV containing the address information.
    </p>
    <p num="345">When a video object unit VOBU is in an interleaved block region, the next-ILVU start address NT_ILVU_SA points to the start address of the next ILVU, similarly expressed as the number of sectors from the navigation pack NV containing the address information.</p>
    <p num="346">
      It is therefore possible after reading the first navigation pack NV data in the interleaved unit ILVU to obtain the location of the next interleaved unit ILVU to be reproduced, and to what disk position the current interleaved unit ILVU is written.
      <br/>
      This makes it possible to only read the interleaved units ILVU, and to smoothly jump to the next interleaved unit ILVU.

    <p num="347">Multi-scene Control</p>
    <p num="348">The multi-scene period is described together with the concept of multi-scene control according to the present invention using by way of example a title comprising scenes recorded from different angles.</p>
    <p num="349">
      Each scene in multi-scene control is recorded from the same angle, but may be recorded at different times or may even be computer graphics data.
      <br/>
      The multi-angle scene periods may therefore also be called multi-scene periods.
    </p>
    <p num="350">Parental Control</p>
    <p num="351">The concept of recording plural titles comprising alternative scenes for such functions as parental lock control and recording director's cuts is described below using FIG. 43.</p>
    <p num="352">
      An example of a multi-rated title stream providing for parental lock control is shown in FIG. 43. When so-called "adult scenes" containing sex, violence, or other scenes deemed unsuitable for children are contained in a title implementing parental lock control, the title stream is recorded with a combination of common system streams SSa, SSb, and Sse, an adult-oriented system stream SSc containing the adult scenes, and a child-oriented system stream SSd containing only the scenes suitable for children.
      <br/>
      Title streams such as this are recorded as a multi-scene system stream containing the adult-oriented system stream Ssc and the child-oriented system stream Ssd arrayed to the multi-scene period between common system streams Ssb and Sse.
    </p>
    <p num="353">The relationship between each of the component titles and the system stream recorded to the program chain PGC of a title stream thus comprised is described below.</p>
    <p num="354">
      The adult-oriented title program chain PGC1 comprises in sequence the common system streams Ssa and Ssb, the adult-oriented system stream Ssc, and the common system stream Sse.
      <br/>
      The child-oriented title program chain PGC2 comprises in sequence the common system streams Ssa and Ssb, the child-oriented system stream Ssd, and the common system stream Sse.
    </p>
    <p num="355">
      By thus arraying the adult-oriented system stream Ssc and child-oriented system stream Ssd to a multi-scene period, the decoding method previously described can reproduce the title containing adult-oriented content by reproducing the common system streams Ssa and Ssb, then selecting and reproducing the adult-oriented system stream Ssc, and then reproducing the common system stream Sse as instructed by the adult-oriented title program chain PGC1.
      <br/>
      By alternatively following the child-oriented title program chain PGC2 and selecting the child-oriented system stream Ssd in the multi-scene period, a child-oriented title from which the adult-oriented scenes have been expurgated can be reproduced.
    </p>
    <p num="356">This method of providing in the title stream a multi-scene period containing plural alternative scenes, selecting which of the scenes in the multi-scene period are to be reproduced before playback begins, and generating plural titles containing essentially the same title content but different scenes in part, is called parental lock control.</p>
    <p num="357">
      Note that parental lock control is so named because of the perceived need to protect children from undesirable content.
      <br/>
      From the perspective of system stream processing, however, parental lock control is a technology for statically generating different title streams by means of the user pre-selecting specific scenes from a multi-scene period.
      <br/>
      Note, further, that this contrasts with multi-angle scene control, which is a technology for dynamically changing the content of a single title by means of the user selecting scenes from the multi-scene period freely and in real-time during title playback.
    </p>
    <p num="358">
      This parental lock control technology can also be used to enable title stream editing such as when making the director's cut.
      <br/>
      The director's cut refers to the process of editing certain scenes from a movie to, for example, shorten the total presentation time.
      <br/>
      This may be necessary, for example, to edit a feature-length movie for viewing on an airplane where the presentation time is too long for viewing within the flight time or certain content may not be acceptable.
      <br/>
      The movie director thus determines which scenes may be cut to shorten the movie.
      <br/>
      The title can then be recorded with both a full-length, unedited system stream and an edited system stream in which the edited scenes are recorded to multi-scene periods.
      <br/>
      At the transition from one system stream to another system stream in such applications, parental lock control must be able to maintain smooth playback image output.
      <br/>
      More specifically, seamless data reproduction whereby a data underflow state does not occur in the audio, video, or other buffers, and seamless information reproduction whereby no unnatural interruptions are audibly or visibly perceived in the audio and video playback, are necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="359">Multi-angle Control</p>
    <p num="360">
      The concept of multi-angle scene control in the present invention is described next with reference to FIG. 44. In general, multimedia titles are obtained by recording both the audio and video information (collectively "recording" below) of the subject over time T. The angled scene blocks -SC1, -SM1, -SM2, -SM3, and -SC3 represent the multimedia scenes obtained at recording unit times T1, T2, and T3 by recording the subject at respective camera angles.
      <br/>
      Scenes -SM1, -SM2, and -SM3 are recorded at mutually different (first, second, and third) camera angles during recording unit time T2, and are referenced below as the first, second, and third angled scenes.
    </p>
    <p num="361">
      Note that the multi-scene periods referenced herein are basically assumed to comprise scenes recorded from different angles.
      <br/>
      The scenes may, however, be Id recorded from the same angle but at different times, or they may be computer graphics data.
      <br/>
      The multi-angle scene periods are thus the multi-scene periods from which plural scenes can be selected for presentation in the same time period, whether or not the scenes are actually recorded at different camera angles.
    </p>
    <p num="362">
      Scenes -SC1 and -SC3 are scenes recorded at the same common camera angle during recording unit times T1 and T3, i.e., before and after the multi-angle scenes.
      <br/>
      These scenes are therefore called "common angle scenes." Note that one of the multiple camera angles used in the multi-angle scenes is usually the same as the common camera angle.
    </p>
    <p num="363">To understand the relationship between these various angled scenes, multi-angle scene control is described below using a live broadcast of a baseball game for example only.</p>
    <p num="364">The common angle scenes -SC1 and -SC3 are recorded at the common camera angle, which is here defined as the view from center field on the axis through the pitcher, batter, and catcher.</p>
    <p num="365">
      The first angled scene -SM1 is recorded at the first multi-camera angle, i.e., the camera angle from the backstop on the axis through the catcher, pitcher, and batter.
      <br/>
      The second angled scene -SM2 is recorded at the second multi-camera angle, i.e., the view from center field on the axis through the pitcher, batter, and catcher.
      <br/>
      Note that the second angled scene -SM2 is thus the same as the common camera angle in this example.
      <br/>
      It therefore follows that the second angled scene -SM2 is the same as the common angle scene -SC2 recorded during recording unit time T2.
      <br/>
      The third angled scene -SM3 is recorded at the third multi-camera angle, i.e., the camera angle from the backstop focusing on the infield.
    </p>
    <p num="366">
      The presentation times of the multiple angle scenes -SM1, -SM2, and -SM3 overlap in recording unit time T2; this period is called the "multi-angle scene period." By freely selecting one of the multiple angle scenes -SM1, -SM2, and -SM3 in this multi-angle scene period, the viewer is able to change his or her virtual viewing position to enjoy a different view of the game as though the actual camera angle is changed.
      <br/>
      Note that while there appears to be a time gap between common angle scenes -SC1 and -SC3 and the multiple angle scenes -SM1, -SM2, and -SM3 in FIG. 44, this is simply to facilitate the use of arrows in the figure for easier description of the data reproduction paths reproduced by selecting different angled scenes.
      <br/>
      There is no actual time gap during playback.
    </p>
    <p num="367">
      Multi-angle scene control of the system stream based on the present invention is described next with reference to FIG. 23 from the perspective of connecting data blocks.
      <br/>
      The multimedia data corresponding to common angle scene -SC is referenced as common angle data BA, and the common angle data BA in recording unit times T1 and T3 are referenced as BA1 and BA3, respectively.
      <br/>
      The multimedia data corresponding to the multiple angle scenes -SM1, ISM2, and -SM3 are referenced as first, second, and third angle scene data MA1, MA2, and MA3.
      <br/>
      As previously described with reference to FIG. 44, scenes from the desired angled can be viewed by selecting one of the multiple angle data units MA1, MA2, and MA3.
      <br/>
      There is also no time gap between the common angle data BA1 and BA3 and the multiple angle data units MA1, MA2, and MA3.
    </p>
    <p num="368">
      In the case of an MPEG system stream, however, intermittent breaks in the playback information can result between the reproduced common and multiple angle data units depending upon the content of the data at the connection between the selected multiple angle data unit MA1, MA2, and MA3 and the common angle data BA (either the first common angle data BA1 before the angle selected in the multi-angle scene period or the common angle data BA3 following the angle selected in the multi-angle scene period).
      <br/>
      The result in this case is that the title stream is not naturally reproduced as a single contiguous title, i.e., seamless data reproduction is achieved but non-seamless information reproduction results.
    </p>
    <p num="369">The multi-angle selection process whereby one of plural scenes is selectively reproduced from the multi-angle scene period with seamless information presentation to the scenes before and after is described below with application in a digital video disk system using FIG. 23.</p>
    <p num="370">
      Changing the scene angle, i.e., selecting one of the multiple angle data units MA1, MA2, and MA3, must be completed before reproduction of the preceding common angle data BA1 is completed.
      <br/>
      It is extremely difficult, for example, to change to a different angle data unit MA2 during reproduction of common angle data BA1.
      <br/>
      This is because the multimedia data has a variable length coded MPEG data structure, which makes it difficult to find the data break points (boundaries) in the selected data blocks.
      <br/>
      The video may also be disrupted when the angle is changed because inter-frame correlations are used in the coding process.
      <br/>
      The group_of_pictures GOP processing unit of the MPEG standard contains at least one refresh frame, and closed processing not referencing frames belonging to another GOP is possible within this GOP processing unit.
    </p>
    <p num="371">
      In other words, if the desired angle data, e. g., MA3, is selected before reproduction reaches the multi-angle scene period, and at the latest by the time reproduction of the preceding common angle data BA1 is completed the angle data selected from within the multi-angle scene period can be seamlessly reproduced.
      <br/>
      However, it is extremely difficult while reproducing one angle to select and seamlessly reproduce another angle within the same multi-angle scene period.
      <br/>
      It is therefore difficult when in a multi-angle scene period to dynamically select a different angle unit presenting, for example, a view from a different camera angle.
    </p>
    <p num="372">The method of switching between scene angles within a multi-angle scene period is described in further detail below with reference to FIG. 76, FIG. 77, and FIG. 45 based on the digital video disk data structure described above.</p>
    <p num="373">
      FIG. 76 shows the presentation times of the smallest angle switching units in each of the multiple angle data units MA1, MA2, and MA3 shown in FIG. 23. Within the context of the digital video disk system, the multiple angle data units MA1, MA2, and MA3 are the title editing units, i.e., the video objects VOB.
      <br/>
      Each multiple angle data unit (VOB) comprises plural (three in this example) interleave units ILVU as the smallest possible angle switching unit.
      <br/>
      Note that each interleaved unit ILVU thus contains a particular number of GOP.
      <br/>
      The first angle data MA1 thus contains angle switching units A51, A52, and A53.
    </p>
    <p num="374">
      The angle switching units A51, A52, and A53 of the first angle data MA1 have presentation times of 1, 2, and 3 seconds, respectively, resulting in the first angle data MA1 having a total presentation time of 6 sec.
      <br/>
      The second angle data MA2 similarly comprises angle switching units B51, B52, and B53 with presentation times of 2, 3, and 1 second, respectively, and the third angle data MA3 comprises angle switching units C51, C52, and C53 with presentation times of 3, 1, and 2 seconds, respectively.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that while the angle data MA1, MA2, and MA3 each has a 6 sec. presentation time, the presentation time can obviously be set to various other particular values.
    </p>
    <p num="375">
      The following example describes switching to and beginning the presentation of another (next) angle view while reproducing any particular interleave unit.
      <br/>
      For example, if the angle is changed from first angle data MA1 to second angle data MA2 while reproducing interleave unit A51, reproduction of interleave unit A51 stops and reproduction of the second interleave unit B52 in the selected second angle data MA2 starts.
      <br/>
      This change intermits both the audio and video presentation, resulting in non-seamless information presentation.
    </p>
    <p num="376">
      Likewise, if the user chooses to switch to the scene corresponding to the third angle data MA3 during reproduction of the second interleave unit B52 in the second angle data MA2, reproduction of interleave unit B52 stops and reproduction of interleave unit C53 starts.
      <br/>
      This operation again intermits both the audio and video presentation, resulting in non-seamless information presentation.
    </p>
    <p num="377">Note that in the above cases switching between multiple angle data during data reproduction stops reproduction of the angle being presented, and seamless information presentation, i.e., presentation without intermitting the audio and video, does not occur.</p>
    <p num="378">The method of switching the angle after completing interleave unit presentation is described below.</p>
    <p num="379">
      If the user selects second angle data MA2 during reproduction of interleave unit AS1 in first angle data MA1, for example, the second interleave unit B52 in the second angle data MA2 is selected from the point reproduction of interleave unit A51 with a presentation time of 1 sec. is completed.
      <br/>
      Because the start of interleave unit B52 is 2 sec. from the beginning of the multi-angle scene period, there is a gap between the end of interleave unit A51 reproduction at 1 sec. into the multi-angle scene period and the beginning of interleave unit B52 at 2 sec. into the multi-angle scene period, and there is therefore no time-base contiguity in reproduction.
      <br/>
      More specifically, because there is no continuity in the audio, the audio cannot be seamlessly reproduced.
    </p>
    <p num="380">
      A similar scenario results if the user then switches to the angle scene corresponding to the third angle data MA3 during reproduction of the second interleave unit B52 in the selected second angle data MA2, i.e., interleave unit C53 is switched to after reproduction of interleave unit B52 is completed.
      <br/>
      In this case the completion of interleave unit B52 reproduction is at 5 sec. from the beginning of the multi-angle scene period, the beginning of interleave unit C53 is at 4 sec. from the beginning of the multi-angle scene period, and there is again no time-base contiguity.
      <br/>
      The connection between the audio and video components of the interleave units B52 and C53 is also not good.
    </p>
    <p num="381">It is therefore necessary for the interleave units of each angle to have the same reproduction time and contain the same number of video frames in order to achieve seamless information switching between multiple angles.</p>
    <p num="382">The internal structure of the interleave units is shown in further detail in FIG. 77. As shown in FIG. 77, each of the interleave units ILVUb1, ILVUb2, ILVUc1, and ILVUc2 contains interleaved audio and video packets, indicated as A and V, respectively.</p>
    <p num="383">
      In general, the data size and presentation time of each audio packet A is the same.
      <br/>
      In this example, interleave units ILVUb1, ILVUb2, ILVUc1, and ILVUc2 respectively contain 3, 2, 2, and 3 audio packets.
      <br/>
      Therefore, angle data MAB and MAC each contain 5 audio packets and 13 video packets in multi-angle scene period T2.
    </p>
    <p num="384">Angle switching control within a multi-angle scene period comprising a multi-angle system stream (VOB) with this packet structure is described below.</p>
    <p num="385">
      If the angle is switched from interleaved unit ILVUb1 to interleaved unit ILVUc2, for example, the total number of audio packets in these two interleave units ILVUb1 and ILVUc2 is 6, which is one more than the specified total number of 5 audio packets in this multi-angle scene period T2.
      <br/>
      This would therefore result in an overlap of one audio packet in the reproduced audio if these two ILVU were connected and reproduced.
      <br/>
      Likewise, if the angle is changed between the two interleaved units ILVUc1 and ILVUb2 containing only two audio packets each, the total of 4 audio packets is one less than the specified total number of 5 audio packets in this multi-angle scene period T2.
      <br/>
      Connecting and reproducing these two interleaved units would therefore result in an audio packet shortage, and a break in the audio equal to the duration of one audio packet.
      <br/>
      It is therefore clear that when the number of audio packets in the connected interleaved units is not equal to the specified number of audio packets in that multi-angle scene period, the audio will not be satisfactorily connected, and non-seamless information presentation containing noise and/or intermittent audio will result.
    </p>
    <p num="386">
      FIG. 45 shows multi-angle scene control when the multi-angle data MAB and MAC shown in FIG. 77 contain different audio data.
      <br/>
      Common angle data BA1 and BA3 contain the common audio data of the common scenes before and after the multi-angle scene period.
      <br/>
      The first angle data MAB comprises first angle interleave unit audio data ILVUb1 and ILVUb2, the smallest angle switching unit within the multi-angle scene period.
      <br/>
      The second angle data MAC likewise comprises second angle interleave unit audio data ILVUc1 and ILVUc2.
    </p>
    <p num="387">
      FIG. 14 shows the audio waves resulting from the audio data recorded to the multi-angle data MAB and MAC within multi-angle scene period T2.
      <br/>
      The contiguous audio output of angle data MAB is formed from the two interleaved unit audio data ILVUb1 and ILVUb2.
      <br/>
      The contiguous audio output of angle data MAC is likewise formed from the two interleaved unit audio data ILVUc1 and ILVUc2.
    </p>
    <p num="388">
      What happens when reproduction of angle data MAC is switched to during reproduction of the first interleave unit audio data ILVUb1 in angle data MAB is described below.
      <br/>
      In this case reproduction of interleaved unit ILVUc2 occurs after reproduction of interleaved unit ILVUb1 is completed.
      <br/>
      As a result, the audio wave resulting from these two interleaves units is a mixed wave as shown by audio wave MAB-C in FIG. 12. Note that the resulting audio output wave is non-contiguous at the angle switching point, and the audio connection is therefore not completely satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p num="389">
      If the audio data is encoded using Dolby AC-3 coding, the problems are even greater because AC-3 coding use time-base correlations.
      <br/>
      Specifically, because the audio is coded using time-base signal correlations, reproduction becomes impossible at the angle switching point when the user attempts to stop the audio data from one angle and switch to the audio data of another angle during reproduction in a multi-angle scene period.
    </p>
    <p num="390">
      Thus, when each angle in a multi-angle scene period contains discrete audio data, the audio output may be intermitted between the connected data units when the angle is changed.
      <br/>
      Depending on the content of the data in such cases, noise and/or audio interruptions may occur during reproduction, resulting even in irritation or discomfort to the user.
      <br/>
      Such discomfort is a product of the non-contiguity in the reproduced information content, and can therefore be avoided by assuring information contiguity or preventing information intermittence.
      <br/>
      Seamless information presentation can thus be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="391">Multi-angle scene control according to the present invention is described next with reference to FIG. 46. Three angle data MA1, MA2, and MA3 are written to multi-angle scene period T2 in this example.</p>
    <p num="392">
      The first angle data MA1 thus contains angle switching units A11, A12, and A13 as the smallest possible angle switching units.
      <br/>
      These angle switching units AS1, A52, and A53 have presentation times of 2, 1, and 3 seconds, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="393">
      The second angle data MA2 similarly comprises angle switching units B11, B12, and B13, and the third angle data MA3 comprises angle switching units C11, C12, and C13.
      <br/>
      Each of these angle switching units also respectively have presentation times of 2, 1, and 3 seconds.
    </p>
    <p num="394">Because the synchronized interleave units thus have the same presentation times, contiguous audio and video reproduction can be achieved without interruptions or overlaps at the angle switching position even when the user switches from one angle to another angle, and seamless information presentation can therefore be achieved as previously described.</p>
    <p num="395">
      To achieve the data structure shown in FIG. 46, i.e., to set the actual presentation times of the smallest angle switching units of the audio and video material in the multi-angle scene period to the same times, the number of reproduction frames in each interleave unit must be the same.
      <br/>
      MPEG data compression normally operates on the GOP unit level, and two parameters defining the GOP structure are the M and N values.
      <br/>
      M is the I- or P-picture cycle, and N is the number of frames contained in that GOP.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, changing the M or N parameter setting frequently during the encoding process simply complicates MPEG video encoding control, and is not, therefore, normally done.
    </p>
    <p num="396">A method of achieving the data structure shown in FIG. 46, i.e., a method of setting the actual presentation times of the smallest angle switching units of the audio and video material in the multi-angle scene period to the same times, is described below with reference to FIG. 78.</p>
    <p num="397">
      As the example shown in FIG. 78 writes two angle data units MAB and MAC to the multi-angle scene period, and each angle data unit comprises two interleaved units ILVUb1 and ILVUb2, and ILVUc1 and ILVUc2, respectively.
      <br/>
      This is for simplicity of discussion only.
      <br/>
      Each interleaved unit is a GOP structure.
      <br/>
      The GOP structures in the multi-angle scene period set the M and N parameters of the synchronized interleaved units ILVUb1 and ILVUc1 to the same values, and similarly set the M and N parameters of the synchronized interleaved units ILVUb2 and ILVUc2 to the same values.
      <br/>
      By thus using the same GOP structure parameters in both angle data MAB and MAC, the presentation times of the AV data in different angles can be set to the same on the smallest angle switching unit level.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the angle is changed from first angle data MAB ILVUb2 to angle data MAC ILVUc2, contiguous video presentation without video intermittence or overlap at the angle switching position can be achieved because the angle switching timing between these two ILVU is the same.
    </p>
    <p num="398">A method for actually setting the audio data presentation times on the smallest angle switching unit level to the same value in different angles is described next with reference to FIG. 79. As in FIG. 77, the interleave units ILVUb1, ILVUb2, ILVUc1, and ILVUc2 contain interleaved audio and video packets, indicated as A and V, respectively.</p>
    <p num="399">
      The audio packet A data size and presentation times are normally constant.
      <br/>
      As also shown in the figure, ILVUb1 and ILVUc1 in the multi-angle scene period have the same number of audio packets (2), and ILVUb2 and ILVUc2 have the same number of audio packets (3).
      <br/>
      By thus writing the same number of audio packets to the synchronized interleaved units ILVU of different angle data MAB and MAC, the audio data presentation times can be set the same on the smallest angle switching unit level in different angles.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the view is changed between angle data MAB and MAC, contiguous audio presentation without audio intermittence or overlap at the angle switching position can be achieved because the angle switching timing does not change.
    </p>
    <p num="400">
      However, if each of the smallest angle switching units in the multi-angle scene period contain audio data describing discrete audio waves, it may not be possible (as described above with reference to FIG. 12) to achieve contiguous audio data reproduction at the angle switching point by simply coding each smallest angle switching unit (ILVU) with the same audio data presentation time.
      <br/>
      It is possible to avoid intermitting the audio presentation, however, by writing the same (common) audio data to each angle within a multi-angle scene period on the smallest angle switching unit (ILVU) level.
      <br/>
      As previously described, seamless information presentation can be achieved by arraying the data to assure contiguous information content before and after the connection points in the reproduced data, or by formatting the data in closed data units that are completely reproduced at the switching points.
    </p>
    <p num="401">A further multi-angle scene period data structure in which common audio data is written to each different angle is shown in FIG. 80. Unlike the structure shown in FIG. 45, this data structure is achieved by writing audio data that is complete within each switching unit (interleaved unit ILVU) to the angle data MAB and MAC.</p>
    <p num="402">Because the audio data is thus complete within each interleaved unit ILVU, audio data producing a discomforting audio wave as a result of connecting different audio waves at the angle switching point will not result even when the angle is changed by switching from first angle interleaved unit ILVUb1 to second angle interleaved unit ILVUc2 within an encoded audio data multi-angle scene period thus structured.</p>
    <p num="403">Note that if the audio data is formed with the same audio wave on the interleaved unit ILVU level, seamless information presentation can obviously be achieved just as when the audio wave data is complete within each interleaved unit ILVU.</p>
    <p num="404">When the audio data is coded using Dolby AC-3 audio coding, the time-base correlations can be retained even when the angle is changed, and contiguous audio reproduction can be achieved at the angle switching point without noise or intermittence, because common audio data is written to the smallest angle switching units (ILVU) of the angle data or is complete within each interleaved unit ILVU.</p>
    <p num="405">
      It should be noted that the present invention shall not be limited to only two or three types of angle data MA within the multi-angle scene period.
      <br/>
      The multi-angle scene period T2 shall also not be limited to VOB units, and may extend for the duration of the title stream.
    </p>
    <p num="406">It is therefore possible to achieve seamless information presentation as previously defined.</p>
    <p num="407">The operation of multi-angle control based on the digital video disk data structure is thus as described above.</p>
    <p num="408">A method of recording to the recording medium multi-angle control data specifically enabling selection of a different angle data unit while reproducing one angle data unit in the same multi-angle scene period is, however, described below.</p>
    <p num="409">
      The common angle data BA1 shown in FIG. 23 is arrayed to a contiguous block region, the interleave unit data of the multi-angle data MA1, MA2, and MA3 in the multi-angle scene period is arrayed to an interleaved block region, and the common angle data BA3 following thereafter is arrayed to the next contiguous block region.
      <br/>
      Referenced to the data structure shown in FIG. 16, the common angle data BA1 constitutes one cell, the multi-angle data MA1, MA2, and MA3 each constitute one cell, the cells corresponding to the multi-angle data MA1, MA2, and MA3 constitute one cell block (the cell block mode CBM of the MA1 cell="cell block start", the CBM of the MA2 cell="between first and last cells"; and the CBM of the MA3 cell "cell block end"), and these cell blocks are angle blocks (cell block type CBT=angle).
      <br/>
      The common angle data BA3 is the cell that connects to that angle block.
      <br/>
      The cell-cell connections are also set for seamless playback (seamless playback flag SPF="seamless playback").
    </p>
    <p num="410">
      The structure of the stream containing a multi-angle scene period and the basics of the on-disk layout in the preferred embodiment of the invention are shown in FIG. 47. The multi-angle scene period is a period in which the stream can be freely changed by the user.
      <br/>
      In a stream with the structure shown in FIG. 47, it is possible to switch to VOB-C or VOB-D during reproduction of VOB-B.
      <br/>
      It is therefore likewise possible to switch to VOB-B or VOB-D during reproduction of VOB-C, and to switch to VOB-C or VOB-B during reproduction of VOB-D.
    </p>
    <p num="411">
      As previously described, the unit for changing the angle, i. e., the angle selection unit, is the smallest interleave unit obtained from the conditions defined by equations 3 and 4, and is defined as the angle interleave unit A-ILVU. A-ILVU management information is also added to the angle interleave unit A-ILVU.
      <br/>
      The navigation pack NV previously described corresponds to this A-ILVU management information.
    </p>
    <p num="412">
      An example in which the last pack address in the current A-ILVU and the address of the next A-ILVU are recorded for plural angles is shown as another embodiment of the invention in FIG. 48. While this figure is very similar to FIG. 42, the angle interleave unit A-ILVU comprises two video object units VOBU in this example, and the navigation pack NV of each VOBU contains the ILVU end pack address ILVU_EA indicating the address of the last pack in the ILVU to which the VOBU belongs, and the next-ILVU start address for each angle data block -1--9 (SML_AGL_Cl_DSTA-SML AGL_C9_DSTA).
      <br/>
      These addresses are expressed as the number of sectors from the navigation pack NV containing the address information.
      <br/>
      In fields in which there is no angle data, information indicating that there is no angle data, e.g., 0, is recorded.
      <br/>
      By thus recording the last pack address and the next-ILVU start address for each angle data block -1--9, it is possible to know the address of each next selectable angle and to switch to a different angle scene without reading unnecessary angle information.
    </p>
    <p num="413">
      For interleaving data in the multi-angle scene period, all angles are interleaved to the same time reference (interleave boundary) using the angle interleave unit A-ILVU for the shortest read time.
      <br/>
      This is to enable the angle to be changed as quickly as possible within the performance limits of the DVD player.
      <br/>
      Interleave unit data is temporarily stored to the track buffer, and the data for the angle selected next is then input to the track buffer.
      <br/>
      However, the next angle cannot be reproduced until the data for the previous angle (the angle being reproduced when the angle was changed) in the track buffer has been consumed.
      <br/>
      It is therefore necessary to minimize the size of the angle interleave unit A-ILVU in order to maximize the speed at which the next angle scene can be selected and presented.
      <br/>
      A common interleave unit size and boundary position must therefore be used between the VOB constituting each angle.
    </p>
    <p num="414">
      This means that the reproduction time of the encoded video stream forming the VOB must be the same for each VOB, and the time at which each interleave unit can be reproduced must be the same, i.e., the interleave unit boundaries must be common, for each interleave unit at the same reproduction time in each angle.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the VOBs constituting each angle must be divided into the same number of interleave units, and the reproduction time of said interleave units must be the same in each angle, i.e., the VOBs constituting each angle must be divided into the same number N of interleave units, and the k-th interleave unit (where 1 &lt;= k &lt;= N) in each angle must have the same reproduction time.
    </p>
    <p num="415">
      Moreover, to seamlessly reproduce the interleave units between each angle, the encoded stream must be complete within each interleave units.
      <br/>
      This means that under the MPEG standard, a closed GOP structure using a compression method that does not reference any frames outside the interleave unit must be used.
      <br/>
      If this method is not used, it is not possible to seamless connect and reproduce interleave units from different angles.
      <br/>
      By using this VOB structure and interleave unit alignment, however, contiguous reproduction is possible time-wise even if the angle is changed.
    </p>
    <p num="416">
      The number of interleave units in the multi-angle scene period is determined by the number of interleave units in the other angles that can be arrayed within the jumpable distance after an interleave unit is read.
      <br/>
      Regarding the arrangement of the interleaved units in each angle, the interleave units reproduced first in each angle are arrayed in the angle sequence, and are subsequently followed by the interleave units reproduced next in each angle being arrayed in the angle sequence.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the number of angles is M (where M is a natural number, and 1 &lt;= M &lt;= 9), the m-th angle is angle -m (where m is a natural number, and 1 &lt;= m &lt;= M), the number of interleave units is N (where N is a natural number greater than or equal to 1), and the n-th interleave unit in a VOB is interleave unit -n (where n is a natural number, and 1 &lt;= n &lt;= N), the interleave unit sequence is angle -1 interleave unit -1, angle -2 interleave unit -1, angle -3 interleave unit -1, angle -M interleave unit -1, angle -1 interleave unit -2, angle -2 interleave unit -2, If the interleave unit length of each angle is the shortest read time for seamlessly selected angles where the angle change is seamless, the maximum distance that must be jumped when moving between angles is the distance from the first angle interleave unit in the sequence to the last interleave unit in the interleave unit sequence of the next angle reproduced within the sequence of angle interleave units reproduced at the same time.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the number of angles is An, the jump distance must satisfy the following equation 7.
      <br/>
      max. angle ILVU length * (An-1) * 2 &lt;= jumpable distance  �7�
    </p>
    <p num="417">
      With non-seamless multi-angle switching, each angle must be seamlessly reproduced, but seamless reproduction is not required when moving between angles.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the interleave unit length of each angle is the shortest read time, the maximum distance that must be jumped when moving between angles is the distance between the interleave units of each angle.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the number of angles is An, the jump distance must satisfy the following equation 8.
      <br/>
      max. angle ILVU length * (An-1) &lt;= jumpable distance  �8�
    </p>
    <p num="418">
      The method of managing addresses on the switching unit level between multiple angle data VOB in multi-angle scene periods is described below with reference to FIGS. 49 and 50. In FIG. 49 the angle interleave unit A-ILVU is the data switching unit, and the address of another angle interleave unit A-ILVU is written to the navigation pack NV of each angle interleave unit A-ILVU.
      <br/>
      FIG. 49 shows the address description achieving seamless reproduction, i.e., uninterrupted reproduction of the audio and video data.
      <br/>
      This addressing method specifically provides for control whereby only the data for the interleave units of the angle to be reproduced is read into the track buffer when the angle is changed.
    </p>
    <p num="419">
      FIG. 50 shows an example in which the video object unit VOBU is the data switching unit, and the address of another video object unit VOBU is written to the navigation pack NV of each video object unit VOBU.
      <br/>
      This addressing method provides for non-seamless reproduction control whereby reproduction can be changed as quickly as possible to another angle near the time when the angle is changed.
    </p>
    <p num="420">
      In FIG. 49, each angle interleave unit A-ILVU in the three multi-angle data VOB-B, VOB-C, and VOB-D records as the address of the next angle interleave unit A-ILVU to be reproduced the address of a chronologically later A-ILVU.
      <br/>
      Note that VOB-B is designated angle -1, VOB-C is angle -2, and VOB-D is angle -3.
      <br/>
      The multi-angle data VOB-B consists of angle interleave units A-ILVUb1, A-ILVUb2, and A-ILVUb3. multi-angle data VOB-C similarly consists of angle interleave units A-ILVUc1, A-ILVUc2, and A-ILVUc3, and multi-angle data VOB-D of angle interleave units A-ILVUd1, A-ILVUd2, and A-ILVUd3.

      This address information more specifically includes in the navigation pack NV of angle interleave unit A-ILVUb1, for example, the end address ILVU_EA of the angle interleave unit A-ILVUb1 to which the navigation pack NV belongs, and the addresses SML_AGL_C-1_DSTA, SML_AGL_C-2_DSTA, and SML_AGL_C-3_DSTA of the navigation packs NV of the next angle interleave units A-ILVUb2, A-ILVUc2, A-ILVUd2 that can be reproduced.
      <br/>
      The navigation pack NV of A-ILVUb2 contains the end address ILVU_EA of A-ILVUb2, and the addresses SML_AGL C-l_DSTA, SML_AGL_C-2_DSTA, and SML-AGL-C-3-DSTA of the navigation packs NV of the next angle interleave units A-ILVUb3, A-ILVUc3, A-ILVUd3 reproduced.

      The navigation pack NV of A-ILVUb3, the last interleave unit in the sequence in this example, contains the end address ILVU_EA of A-ILVUb3, and termination information as the address of the navigation pack NV of the next A-ILVU reproduced, e.g., a NULL value or string of all is as the ILVU_EA.
    </p>
    <p num="432">The specifics of the address information written to the other video objects VOB-C and VOB-D in this example are the same.</p>
    <p num="433">
      By writing this address information to the navigation packs NV of each angle interleave unit A-ILVU, it is possible to read ahead the address of the next A-ILVU to be reproduced in chronological sequence, and is therefore suited to seamless reproduction.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, because the address of the next A-ILVU in each of the other available angles is also recorded to each navigation pack NV, the next address of the selected angle can be easily obtained without giving special consideration to whether the angle is changed or not, and jumping to the next interleave unit can be controlled by the same control sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="434">By thus recording the relative addresses of each A-ILVU that can be selected from each angle, and constructing the encoded video stream contained in each A-ILVU from closed GOP, seamless reproduction without video disruption can be achieved when the viewing angle is changed.</p>
    <p num="435">
      The audio data can also be seamlessly reproduced if the same audio is recorded for each angle, if the audio is complete within each ILVU, or if discrete audio data is recorded.
      <br/>
      Moreover, if identical audio data is recorded to each interleaved unit ILVU, the listener will not even be able to discern that the audio track has changed if the audio is seamlessly reproduced across angle changes.
    </p>
    <p num="436">A data structure enabling non-seamless reproduction of angle changes, i.e., seamless data reproduction permitting perceptible breaks in the content of the reproduced information, is described below with reference to FIG. 50.</p>
    <p num="437">
      It is assumed in FIG. 50 that multi-angle data VOB-B comprises three video object units VOBUb1, VOBUb2, and VOBUb3.
      <br/>
      Multi-angle data VOB-C similarly comprises three video object units VOBUc1, VOBUc2, and VOBUc3, and VOB-D comprises three video object units VOBUd1, VOBUd2, and VOBUd3.
      <br/>
      As in the case shown in FIG. 49, the navigation pack NV of each video object unit VOBU contains the end pack address VOBU_EA of each VOBU.
      <br/>
      Note that this end pack address VOBU_EA is the address of a navigation pack NV in a VOBU comprising a navigation pack NV and one or more other packs.
      <br/>
      In this example, however, the NSML_AGL_C-_DSTA address written to the navigation pack NV of each VOBU does not describe a chronologically later VOBU address, but the address of a VOBU in a different angle with a reproduction time preceding the time the angle is changed.
    </p>
    <p num="438">
      In other words, addresses NSML_AGL_C-1_DSTA to NSML_AGL_C-9_DSTA to VOBU in other angles synchronized to the current VOBU are recorded.
      <br/>
      As above, -1--9 represent different angle numbers.
      <br/>
      For fields in which an angle of the corresponding number does not exist, a value, e.g., 0, indicating that the angle does not exist is recorded.
      <br/>
      Thus, the navigation pack NV of video object unit VOBUb1 of multi-angle data VOB-B contains NSML AGL_C-2_DSTA and NSML_AGL C-3_DSTA, the relative addresses of the synchronized VOBUc1 and VOBUd1 in VOB-C and VOB-D as shown by lines Pb1c' and Pb1d'.
    </p>
    <p num="439">
      The navigation pack NV of video object unit VOBUb2 similarly contains as shown by lines Pb2c' and Pb2d' the relative addresses NSML AGL C-2_DSTA and NSML_AGL_C-3_DSTA of the synchronized VOBUc2 and VOBUd2.
      <br/>
      The navigation pack NV of video object unit VOBUb3 similarly contains as shown by lines Pb3c' and Pb3d' the relative addresses NSML AGL C-2_DSTA and NSML_AGL C-3_DSTA of the synchronized VOBUc3 and VOBUd3.
    </p>
    <p num="440">The navigation packs NV of video object units VOBUc1, VOBUc2, and VOBUc3 of VOB-C similarly contain the relative addresses NSML_AGL_C-1_DSTA and NSML_AGL_C-3_DSTA of the respectively synchronized VOBU as shown by lines Pc1b', Pc1d', Pc2b', Pc2d', Pc3b', and Pc3d'.</p>
    <p num="441">The navigation packs NV of video object units VOBUd1, VOBUd2, and VOBUd3 of VOB-D likewise contain the relative addresses NSML_AGL_C-l_DSTA and NSML_AGL_C-2_DSTA of the respectively synchronized VOBU as shown by lines Pd1b', Pd1c', Pd2b', Pd2c', Pd3b', and Pd3c'.</p>
    <p num="442">The angle selection address information NSML_AGL_C-4_DSTA to NSML_AGL C-9_DSTA for non-existent angles -4--9 in this example record a value indicating that corresponding angles do not exist, e.g., a 0 value.</p>
    <p num="443">During reproduction of angle data with this data structure, the DVD decoder interrupts reproduction of the angle VOBU data currently being reproduced when the angle is changed, then reads and begins reproducing the VOBU data for the selected angle.</p>
    <p num="444">
      Note that while there appears to be a time offset between the interleaved units of VOB-C relative to VOB-B and VOB-D in FIG. 50, this is merely to facilitate easier understanding of the address descriptions written to the respective navigation packs NV of each VOB using the line arrows as shown.
      <br/>
      There is, in fact, no time shifting between the respective interleaved video objects VOB, which are aligned as shown in FIG. 49.
    </p>
    <p num="445">
      The data structure shown in FIG. 50 thus contains as pointers to the next VOBU to be reproduced addresses to another VOBU that should normally be reproduced either simultaneously with or chronologically before the VOBU containing the address information.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the angle is changed, reproduction is continued from a scene at a past point in time.
      <br/>
      This method of encoding the address information is thus preferable when seamless angle switching not required, i.e., for non-seamless information reproduction in which contiguity is not required in the reproduced information.

    <p num="753">
      With reference to FIG. 66, a construction of the stream buffer 2400 which can performs the end detection of interleave unit ILVU is described briefly.
      <br/>
      The stream buffer 2400 comprises a VOB buffer 2402, a system buffer 2404, a navigation pack extractor 2406, and a data counter 2408.
      <br/>
      The system buffer 2404 temporarily stores the title control data VTSI(FIG. 16) included in signal St61, and outputs a control information St2450 (St63) such as VTS_PGC.
    </p>
    <p num="754">The VOB buffer 2402 temporarily stores the title VOB data VTSTT_VOB (FIG. 1002), and the stream St67 to the system decoder 2500.</p>
    <p num="755">
      The NV (navigation pack) extractor 2406 receives the VOB data at the same time with the VOB buffer 2402, and extracts the navigation pack NV therefrom.
      <br/>
      The NV extractor 2406 furthermore extracts the VOBU final pack address COBU_EA or ILVU final pack address ILVU_EA which are the DSI generation information DSI_GI shown in FIG. 19 to produce a pack address information St2452 (St63).
    </p>
    <p num="756">
      The data counter 2408 receives the VOB data at the same time with the VOB buffer 2402, and counts each of pack data shown in FIG. 19 byte by bye.
      <br/>
      Then, the data counter 2408 produces a pack input terminating signal St2454 (St63) at the time when the inputting of pack data is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="757">
      Due to its construction shown in FIG. 66, the stream buffer 2400 performs the VOBU data transfer as examples at step -31064 of FIG. 72, as follows.
      <br/>
      The stream buffer 2400 outputs the VOBU data for the NV extractor 2406 and data counter 2408 at the same time when the VOBU buffer 2400 receives the VOBI data on the top of interleave unit ILVU.
      <br/>
      As a result, the NV extractor 2406 can extracts the data of ILVU_EA and NT_ILVU_SA at the same time with the inputting of navigation pack data NV, and outputs thereof as signal St2452 (St63) to the decode system controller 2300 (FIG. 26).
    </p>
    <p num="758">
      The decode system controller 2300 stores the signal St2452 into the ILVU_EA_reg and NT_ILVU_SA_reg, and then start to counts the number of packs based on the pack terminating signal 2452 from the data counter 2408.
      <br/>
      Based on the fore mentioned the counted value of packs and ILVU_EA_reg, the decode system controller 2300 detects the instance when the inputting of final pack data of ILVU is completed, or the inputting final byte data of the final pack of the ILVU is completed.
      <br/>
      Then, the controller 2300 further give a command for the bitstream reproducer 2000 to move to the position having a sector address indicated by NT_ILVU_SA_reg.
      <br/>
      The bitstream producer 2000 moves to the sector address indicated NT_ILVU_SA_reg, and starts to read the data.
      <br/>
      Thus, the detection of final end of ILVU and reading process for the next ILVU can be performed effectively.
    </p>
    <p num="759">
      In the above, an example where the multimedia data MBS is reproduced by the bitstream reproducer 2000 without a buffering process, and is inputted to the stream buffer 2499.
      <br/>
      However, in the case that the signal processor 2008 of the bitstream reproducer 2000 is incorporated with a buffer for error correction process, for example, the controller 2300 gives a moving command to reproducer 2000 so that the reproducer 2000 moves to the reading position indicated by NT_ILVU_SA_reg after completion of the final pack data of fore mentioned ILVU and clearing the internal buffer of the reproducer 2000.
      <br/>
      Thus, the effective reproduction of ILVU data even when the bitstream reproducer 2000 includes a buffer for error correction code (ECC) process.
    </p>
    <p num="760">
      Furthermore, when the bitstream producer 2000 has a buffer for ECC process, the data can be transferred effectively by providing any means having a function equivalent to that of data counter 2408 (FIG. 66).
      <br/>
      In other words, the bitstream reproducer 2000 generates the pack input completion signal St62; the decode system controller 2300 gives a command based on the signal St62 the bitstream reproducer 200 to move to the reading position having sector address designated by NT_ILVU_SA_reg.
      <br/>
      As apparent from the above, the data can be transferred effectively even when the bitstream reproducer 2000 has a function to buffer the data reproduced from the recording media M.
    </p>
    <p num="761">
      It is to be noted that the apparatus and method substantially the same as those described in the above with respect to the interleave unit ILVU can be used for the detection VOBU end.
      <br/>
      In other words, by replacing the extraction of ILVU_EA and NT_ILVU_Sa, and the storing of ILVU_EA_reg and NT_ILVU_SA_reg with the extraction of VOBU_EA and storing VOBU_EA_reg, the apparatus and method according to the present invention, described above, can be used for the detection of unatend.
      <br/>
      This is effective for the VOBU data transferring operations shown at steps -31074, -31082, -31092, and -31102.
    </p>
    <p num="762">
      Thus, the reading of data such as ILVU and VOBU can be performed effectively.
