      The present invention provides a phase-locked loop having a multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator.
      <br/>
      The phase-locked loop comprises a divided-by-N counter, a divided-by-M counter, a phase frequency detector, a charge pump, a loop filter, a multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator, a switching unit, and a clock counter.
      <br/>
      It utilizes a multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator instead of a conventional voltage controlled oscillator and a switching unit is used to select the output signal from the multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator.
      <br/>
      The switching time of the switching unit is controlled by the clock counter to achieve the effect of frequency expansion.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to a phase-locked loop, and more particularly, to a phase-locked loop that utilizes a multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator to achieve frequency expansion effect.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In the clock synthesizer of a mainboard, a phase-locked loop is often utilized to perform data recovery.
      <br/>
      Moreover, some modifications are often made to a phase-locked loop so that it has frequency expansion capability for reducing electromagnetic interference (EMI).
      <br/>
      However, there is no simple way to achieve frequency expansion in conventional phase-locked loops.
    </p>
    <p num="3">FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional phase-locked loop comprising a divided-by-N counter 11, a divided-by-M counter 12, a phase frequency detector 13, a charge pump 14, a loop filter 15, and a voltage controlled oscillator 16.</p>
    <p num="4">The divided-by-N counter 11 outputs a clock signal with frequency 1/N that of its input clock signal (i.e. fxtal), which will be denoted by fxtal /N in the following.</p>
    <p num="5">
      FIG. 2 illustrates the cases that the frequency fxtal is reduced to 1/2 and 1/3 of its original frequency respectively.
      <br/>
      The divided-by-M counter 12 outputs a clock signal with frequency 1/M that of its input clock signal (i.e. fvco), which will be denoted by fvco /M in the following.
      <br/>
      The phase frequency detector 13 compares the signals fxtal /N and fvco /M, outputs signals which are determined by the frequency difference and phase difference of the two signals fxtal /N and fvco /M.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3(a), when the phase of fvco /M lags behind that of fxtal /N (as denoted in the figure by dotted lines), the phase frequency detector 13 outputs an `up` signal.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 3(b), when the phase of fvco /M is ahead of that of fxtal /N (as denoted in the figure by dotted lines), the phase frequency detector 13 outputs an `dn` signal.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 4, the charge pump 14 and the loop filter 15 cooperatively convert the `up` and `dn` signals outputted from the phase frequency detector 13 into a voltage signal Vc.
      <br/>
      When the phase frequency detector 13 outputs an `up` signal, the output voltage Vc of the loop filter 15 is increased.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the phase frequency detector 13 outputs an `dn` signal, the output voltage Vc of the loop filter 15 is decreased.
      <br/>
      The voltage controlled oscillator 16 outputs a clock signal with frequency fvco determined by the output voltage Vc of the loop filter 15.
      <br/>
      The frequency fvco increases as voltage Vc increases, and decreases as voltage Vc decreases.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      As describe above, when the phase-locked loop is in a phase-locked state, the phase of fxtal /N is in alignment with that of fvco /M and the frequencies of these two clock signals are the same, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      In other words, fvco =(M/N) * fxtal.
      <br/>
      It can be seen from this equation that the fvco can be determined by M and N.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The concept of frequency expansion is described in the following.
      <br/>
      Assume that clock signals with some fixed frequency is desired, then clock signals with frequency varies in a predetermined frequency range centering at that frequency is generated.
      <br/>
      For example, frequency may vary linearly and periodically in a predetermined frequency range.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 1, the frequency fvco can be made to vary linearly and periodically by making Vc vary linearly and periodically, which can be achieved by making the `up` and `dn` signals vary alternately and periodically.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the `up` and `dn` signals may be made to vary alternately and periodically by adjusting the values of M and/or N. As shown in FIG. 5, while the phase-locked loop 1 is in a phase-locked state, the phase of fxtal /N is in alignment with that of fvco /M and there is no `up` or `dn` signal generated.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 6, when the value of M is suddenly changed to (M+ DELTA M) or (M- DELTA M), the `up` and `dn` signals are alternately generated.
      <br/>
      Similarly, when the value of N is suddenly changed to (N+ DELTA N) or (N- DELTA N), the up` and `dn` signals are alternately generated as well.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      As described above, controlling the value of M (or N) results in the `up` and `dn` signals being generated alternately.
      <br/>
      This, in turn, leads to Vc varying linearly and periodically.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the value of fvco varies linearly and periodically.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 shows the variation of fvco when M varies through a series of increments ( DELTA M) and then a series of decrements (- DELTA M) From the figure, it can be seen that fvco varies linearly and periodically in a predetermined frequency range centering at the frequency f.
    </p>
    <p num="9">From the above description, it can be seen that a phase-locked loop can achieve the effect of frequency expansion by controlling the values of M and N. However, controlling M and N is not easy and may require a complicated circuit.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="15">Referring to FIG. 8, a phase-locked loop having a multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator includes: a divided-by-N counter 21, a divided-by-M counter 22, a phase frequency detector 23, a charge pump 24, a loop filter 25, a multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator 26, a switching unit 27, and a clock counter 28.</p>
    <p num="16">Among the aforementioned components, the divided-by-N counter 21, the divided-by-M counter 22, the phase frequency detector 23, the charge pump 24, and the loop filter 25 are similar to those in the prior art and will not be described here.</p>
    <p num="17">The multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator 26 receives the output voltage Vc from the loop filter 25 and outputs a plurality of periodical signals PH0, PH1, . . . , Phk of the same frequency and different phases, wherein one of the clock signals is used as the output clock signal of the phase-locked loop.</p>
    <p num="18">The switching unit 27 is connected between the divided-by-M counter 22 and the multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator 26 for selecting a clock signal among the output clock signals of the multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator 26 as the input clock signal of the divided-by-M counter 22.</p>
    <p num="19">The counter 28 generates a clock control signal Tc for controlling the switching time of the switching unit 27.</p>
    <p num="20">A practical example is given-in the following to explain how to achieve the effect of frequency expansion by utilizing the multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator 26, the switching unit 27, and the clock counter 28.</p>
    <p num="21">In the practical example, the multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator 26 outputs eight clock signals PH0, PH7, . . . , Ph7 with the same frequency and different phases, the oscillation period of the multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator is T and the phase difference between two adjacent clock signals is T/8 (as shown in FIG. 9).</p>
    <p num="22">
      The phase frequency detector 23 determines whether the signal fxtal /N lags behind or leads the signal fvco /M according to the rising edges of the input signals.
      <br/>
      For example, decision is made at time t0 and t2 for the case of PH0.
      <br/>
      In another aspect, the switching time of the switching unit 27 occurs at falling edges.
      <br/>
      For example, switching occurs at time t1 for the case of PH0.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      If the phases of the signal fxtal /N and the signal PH0 /M are in alignment and the clock counter 28 causes the switching unit 27 to switch to PH1 at time t1, then the first rising edge of the signal PH1 appears at time t3 while the first rising edge of the signal PH0 appears at time t2.
      <br/>
      As a result, the signal fvco /M lags T/8 behind the signal fxtal /N.
      <br/>
      Under the situation, the phase frequency detector 23 outputs an `up` signal, as illustrates in FIG. 3(a).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      At a later time when a phase locked state has been achieved, the clock counter 28 causes the switching unit 27 to switch from PH1 to PH2, and the signal fvco /M then again lags T/8 behind the signal fxtal /N.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the phase frequency detector 23 outputs an `up` signal.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Subsequently, the clock counter 28 causes the switching unit 27 to switch from PH2 to PH3 and the phase frequency detector 23 outputs an `up` signal.
      <br/>
      The situations while the clock counter 28 causes the switching unit 27 to switch from PHi to PHi+1 mod 8 (3 &lt;= i &lt;= 7) are similar and a repetitious statement is thus omitted.
      <br/>
      In the aforementioned process, the clock signal fout (=PH7) generated by the phase-locked loop 2 has frequency increasing with time.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      On the other hand, in the process including one or multiple stages that the switching unit 27 switches from PHi+1 mod 8 to PHi (0 &lt;= i &lt;= 7), the output clock signal fout has frequency decreasing with time.
      <br/>
      According to the above description, it is obvious that, by selecting the switching sequence of PHi 's adequately, the frequency of the output clock signal fout can be controlled to vary increasingly and decreasingly, centering at some fixed frequency and not exceeding some fixed range.
      <br/>
      Frequency expansion can thus be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="27">Moreover, the multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator 26 is a ring oscillator.</p>
    <p num="28">
      To sum up, the phase-locked loop 2 in accordance with the present invention utilizes a multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator 26 instead of a conventional voltage controlled oscillator, wherein a switching unit 27 is used to select the output signal of the multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator 26.
      <br/>
      The switching time of the switching unit is controlled by a clock counter 28.
      <br/>
      Therefore, frequency expansion can be achieved by a simple modification made to a conventional phase-locked loop.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Although the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention defined by the appended claims.</p>
