    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention relates to polymerizable mesogenic fluorophenylenes of formula I  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="2">wherein P, Sp, X, n, L, Z1, Z2, A, B, m and R are defined below.</p>
    <p num="3">The invention also relates to a polymerizable liquid crystalline composition comprising at least one polymerizable mesogenic compound of formula I, and to the use of the inventive mesogenic compounds and compositions for the preparation of linear or crosslinked liquid crystalline polymers, in particular for the preparation of oriented linear or crosslinked liquid crystalline polymer films.</p>
    <p num="4">The invention further relates to the use of inventive compounds, compositions and polymers in liquid crystal displays, such as STN, TN, AMD-TN, temperature compensation, guest-host, phase change, reflective or surface stabilized or polymer stabilized cholesteric texture (SSCT, PSCT) displays, in active and passive optical elements like polarizers, compensators, alignment layers, color filters or holographic elements, in adhesives, synthetic resins with anisotropic mechanical properties, cosmetics, diagnostics, liquid crystal pigments, for decorative and security applications, in nonlinear optics, optical information storage or as chiral dopants.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Polymerizable mesogenic compounds, which are also known as reactive mesogenic compounds, have been described in prior art for various purposes.
      <br/>
      For example, they can be polymerized in situ whilst being macroscopically oriented in the liquid crystalline state to give anisotropic linear or crosslinked polymers or polymer films with uniform orientation of high quality.
      <br/>
      These films can be used for example as optical elements like broad band cholesteric polarizers (see EP 0 606 940) or polarization filters (EP 0 397 263).
    </p>
    <p num="6">The WO 93/22397, DE 195 04 224 and WO 97/34862 for example disclose polymerizable mesogenic compounds with mesogenic cores of various structures.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The polymerizable mesogenic compounds described in prior art, however, often exhibit liquid crystalline phases only in a small temperature range or do not show mesophase behavior at all.
      <br/>
      Another drawback for specific applications is that prior art compounds often exhibit high values of the birefringence.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In particular where polymerizable mesogenic compounds are used in optical phase retardation, compensation or alignment layers or films for liquid crystal displays, it is desirable to have available materials of which the optical properties, such as the birefringence, phase retardation (i.e. the product of birefringence and layer thickness) and dispersion (i.e. the wavelength dependence of the birefringence) are adapted to those of the liquid crystal mixture in the display cell, so that optimum compensation can be achieved.</p>
    <p num="9">Thus, there is still a demand for polymerizable mesogenic compounds with a broad liquid crystalline phase and a low value of birefringence.</p>
    <p num="10">Furthermore, regarding the broad range of applications for polymerizable mesogenic compounds it is desirable for the expert to have available further compounds of this type which are easy to synthesize and fulfill the various requirements as described above.</p>
    <p num="11">
      It was an aim of the invention to provide new polymerizable mesogenic compounds with advantageous properties, thus extending the pool of reactive liquid crystal compounds available to the expert.
      <br/>
      Other aims of the present invention are immediately evident to the person skilled in the art from the following detailed description.
    </p>
    <p num="12">It was now found that these aims can be achieved by providing polymerizable mesogenic fluorophenylenes of formula I.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The terms polymerizable mesogenic compound as used in the foregoing and the following comprise compounds with a rod-shaped, board-shaped or disk-shaped mesogenic group, i.e. a group with the ability to induce mesophase behavior in a compound comprising said group.
      <br/>
      These compounds do not necessarily have to exhibit mesophase behavior by themselves.
      <br/>
      It is also possible that these compounds show mesophase behavior only in mixtures with other compounds or when the polymerizable mesogenic compounds or the mixtures comprising them are polymerized.

      As a source for actinic radiation for example a single UV lamp or a set of UV lamps can be used.
      <br/>
      Another possible source for actinic radiation is a laser, like e.g. a UV laser, an IR laser or a visible laser.
    </p>
    <p num="71">When polymerizing by means of UV light, for example a photoinitiator can be used that decomposes under UV irradiation to produce free radicals or ions that start the polymerization reaction.</p>

      It is also possible to put a second substrate on top of the coated mixture prior to, during and/or after polymerization.
      <br/>
      The substrates can be removed after polymerization or not.
      <br/>
      When using two substrates in case of curing by actinic radiation, at least one substrate has to be transmissive for the actinic radiation used for the polymerization.

    <p num="77">
      Isotropic or birefringent substrates can be used.

    <p num="78">
      Preferably at least one substrate is a plastic substrate such as for example a film of polyester such as polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), of polyvinylalcohol (PVA), polycarbonate (PC) or triacetylcellulose (TAC), especially preferably a PET film or a TAC film.
      <br/>
      As a birefringent substrate for example an uniaxially stretched plastic film can be used.

      It is also possible to apply an alignment layer, for example a layer of rubbed polyimide or sputtered SiOx, on top of at least one of the substrates.
      <br/>
      In some cases, the mixtures orient themselves spontaneously on the substrate, or good alignment is achieved already by the act of coating the mixture.

      In another preferred embodiment, a second substrate is put on top of the coated material.

      In this case, the shearing caused by putting together the two substrates is sufficient to give good alignment.
    </p>
    <p num="82">It is also possible to apply an electric or magnetic field to align the coated mixture.</p>
    <p num="83">
      In some cases it is of advantage to apply a second substrate not only to aid alignment of the polymerizable mixture but also to exclude oxygen that may inhibit the polymerization.
      <br/>
      Alternatively the curing can be carried out under an atmosphere of inert gas.
      <br/>
      However, curing in air is also possible using suitable photoinitiators and high lamp power.
      <br/>
      When using a cationic photoinitiator oxygen exclusion most often is not needed, but water should be excluded.
    </p>
    <p num="84">For the preparation of anisotropic polymer gels, the polymerizable mesogenic compound can be polymerized in situ as described above, however, in this case alignment of the polymerizable mixture is not necessarily required, although it may be desired for specific applications.</p>
    <p num="85">The invention also relates to the use of inventive compounds, compositions and polymers in liquid crystal displays, such as STN, TN, AMD-TN, temperature compensation, guest-host, phase change or surface stabilized or polymer stabilized cholesteric texture (SSCT, PSCT) displays, in active and passive optical elements like polarizers, compensators, alignment layers, color filters or holographic elements, in adhesives, synthetic resins with anisotropic mechanical properties, cosmetics, diagnostics, liquid crystal pigments, for decorative and security applications, in nonlinear optics, optical information storage or as chiral dopants.</p>
    <p num="86">
      The inventive compounds of formula I are particularly suitable, and preferably used, for the preparation of oriented birefringent polymer layers or films that are used as alignment or compensation layers in liquid crystal displays, in particular where these layers are applied to the surface of the electrodes of the liquid crystal cell facing the liquid crystal mixture, i.e. inside the cell.
      <br/>
      They are in particular suitable for the preparation of retardation or compensation layers in black and white or color reflective TN displays, especially single polarizer reflective displays (SPRD), as described e.g. by M. Tillin, SID 1998 Digest, 311-314 and the references cited therein.
    </p>
    <p num="87">By using the inventive polymerizable compounds for birefringent optical polymer films in liquid crystal displays, it is possible to adapt the optical properties of the birefringent polymer, like e.g. the retardation or the dispersion, to those of the LC mixture, and thereby to optimize the electrooptical properties of the display.</p>
