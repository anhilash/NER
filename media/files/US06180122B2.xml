      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a solid composition for topical application, as well as to its use in the cosmetic and/or dermatological fields, in particular to care for and/or treat the skin, the scalp, the hair or mucous membranes, to make up the skin and/or keratin fibres such as the eyelashes and the hair, and to style and/or shape keratin fibres, and in particular the hair.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Background</p>
    <p num="4">
      Products in solid form are known in the cosmetics industry.
      <br/>
      As products of this type, mention may be made, for example, in the field of make-up, of tubes or "sticks" of lipstick, of foundation or of eyeshadow; in the field of skin care or lip care, of lip repair pencils and of depigmenting, make-up-removing or moisturizing tubes or "sticks"; in the field of hygiene, of deodorant sticks and of moussing sticks or bars to shave or wash the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Wax-based stick formulations have certain drawbacks: they have a greasy nature which is not appreciated by users, and they lack freshness when applied.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is difficult to introduce hydrophilic active agents therein.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Moreover, non-greasy sticks such as deodorant sticks generally contain a relatively large amount of fatty acid salts which can have an irritant nature for applications such as facial care.
      <br/>
      Moreover, these sticks leave a sticky film when applied to the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In addition, aqueous rigid gels are described in WO-A-97/17055 and WO-A-97/17053.
      <br/>
      However, these gels require the use of a fairly large concentration of gelling agent or use a specific preparation technique--extrusion.
      <br/>
      In addition, the sticks described in WO-A-97/17055 lack transparency and, on account of the high concentration of gelling agent, lack freshness and softness when applied to the skin, and those described in WO-A-97/17053 must be moistened at the time of use.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Moreover, EP-A-803,245 describes aqueous solid compositions containing heat-reversible polysaccharides, a wetting agent and a powdery phase (fillers).
      <br/>
      However, the presence of a powdery phase can entail the following drawbacks: presence of a visible trace after applying the composition to the skin and reduced feeling of comfort.
      <br/>
      In addition, when the powdery phase is removed from the composition described in EP-A-803,245, a composition which is neither sufficiently solid nor sufficiently stable and which does not transfer onto the skin in a satisfactory manner is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Thus, there is still a need for a solid composition for topical application which does not have the drawbacks of the prior art.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The inventors have discovered, unexpectedly, a specific hydrophilic gelling system which makes it possible to prepare homogeneous, rigid aqueous compositions which are stable even at low gelling agent contents and even in the absence of fillers, and which do not necessarily require the use of a specific preparation technique.
      <br/>
      The compositions obtained can contain a large amount of water and thus have a sensation of freshness when applied while at the same time giving an impression of softness.
      <br/>
      In addition, they allow product to be applied directly to the skin without the need for prior moistening.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The object of the present invention is a solid composition free of fillers, comprising an aqueous phase, wherein said aqueous phase comprises a hydrocolloid combination of gellan gum and at least one other hydrocolloid, wherein said gellan gum is present in an amount of at least 2% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition, and wherein said hydrocolloid combination is present in an amount of less than 20% of the total weight of the composition.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The term "free of fillers" means that the composition contains no insoluble dyes or pigments or powders.
      <br/>
      The composition of the invention is, in particular, free of powders such as talc, starch, acrylate polymer and copolymer, mica, kaolin, polyamide (nylon), polyethylene silica and silicone powders.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Moreover, the term "hydrocolloid" means a water-soluble macromolecule which does not modify the water activity value of the composition containing it.</p>
    <p num="14">In addition, the term solid composition means any composition with a compression strength of greater than or equal to 20 grams, at room temperature (20-25 (degree)  C.), after penetration by an axisymmetrical probe with a diameter of 0.8 cm into the matrix of the composition to a depth of 1 mm at a speed of 0.5 mm/s and removal of the said probe from the matrix of the composition at a speed of 0.5 mm/s; the compression strength is measured with an analyzer such as the "LFRA texture analyzer" sold by the company Stevens/Mechtric.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The solid composition obtained can be applied directly to a support, i.e. it does not need to be moistened in order to be applied to the support, and in particular to the skin.
      <br/>
      The term "support" for the composition according to the invention means any surface on which a topical application may be made, in particular the skin, keratin fibres such as the eyelashes and the hair, the scalp and mucous membranes such as the lips.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In addition, unlike solid compositions containing a high proportion of gelling agents, the composition of the invention has the advantage of not leaving a visible powdery deposit when it is applied to a support.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it has the property of being transparent or translucent in the absence of oil.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      It is known practice in the food sector to use gellane gum, including its use as a mixture with another gum, in order to obtain gelled products.
      <br/>
      However, the products obtained are gelled but not solid within the sense intended in the present application, i.e., they do not have a compression strength of greater than or equal to 20 grams: they are brittle, so that they can be consumed in portions, and they consequently do not allow a homogeneous film to be deposited on the skin.
      <br/>
      This is therefore an entirely different type of product.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Moreover, the gellane gum used as sole gelling agent at 2% gives a composition which is, admittedly, solid, but is crumbly and brittle, and is thus unsuitable for cosmetic or dermatological application.
      <br/>
      In addition, by increasing the amount of gellan gum, an opaque composition is obtained which applies poorly to a support such as the skin.
      <br/>
      Only the combination claimed makes it possible to obtain a solid composition with good properties of both solidity and transfer.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Thus, the solid composition according to the invention has a good transfer property, i.e., when applied to a support, it releases an effective amount of product onto this support.</p>
    <p num="20">In the composition according to the invention, the gellan gum is present in an amount of at least 2% of the total weight of the composition, for example in an amount ranging from 2 to 15%, preferably from 2 to 8% and better still from 2 to 4%, of the total weight of the composition.</p>
    <p num="21">The hydrocolloid(s) used in combination with the gellan gum can be chosen, for example, from the group formed by:</p>
    <p num="22">
      cellulose or its derivatives such as carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or hydroxyethylcellulose, as well as celluloses modified in particular by grafting an alkyl group;
      <br/>
      algal extracts such as agar-agar, carrageenans and alginates;
      <br/>
      seed extracts such as carob gum, guar gum and guar gums modified in particular by grafting an alkyl group;
      <br/>
      plant exudates such as gum arabic, karaya gum, gum tragacanth and ghatti gum;
      <br/>
      microorganism exudates such as xanthan gum;
      <br/>
      fruit extracts such as pectins;
      <br/>
      gelling agents of animal origin such as gelatin and caseinates;
      <br/>
      water-soluble gelling synthetic polymers such as polyacrylic acids, optionally crosslinked with an alkyl chain, such as the "Carbopol" or "Pemulen" products from the company Goodrich;
      <br/>
      silicon derivatives such as synthetic hectorites, for instance the products "Laponite RD and RDS" sold by the company Waverly, and aluminium magnesium silicates such as the product "Veegum" sold by the company Vanderbilt, or a mixture of these compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The hydrocolloid used in the composition according to the invention in combination with the gellan gum is preferably chosen from carob gum, xanthan gum, cellulose derivatives and a modified guar gum, and mixtures of these compounds.
      <br/>
      It is more particularly xanthan gum, carboxymethylcellulose or a modified guar gum.
      <br/>
      This modified guar gum may in particular be hydroxypropylguar.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The hydrocolloid(s) combined with the gellane gum is (are) present in the composition according to the invention in an amount which can vary within a wide range.
      <br/>
      Thus, this amount can range, for example, from 1 to 10%, preferably from I to 5% and, better still, from 2 to 4%, of the total weight of the composition.

    <p num="25">Depending on the proportions, and in particular when the total amount of hydrocolloids exceeds 4%, the mixture can advantageously be prepared in a twin-screw extruder according to the technique described in EP-A-667,148.</p>
