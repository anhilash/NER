    <heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The PCT/CH97/00168 application of Apr. 28, 1997 (EPA 97'917'205-3) describes ultramicroemulsions from spontaneously dispersible concentrates comprising esters with bioflavonoid compounds having antitumor, antiviral, virucidal and/or antiparasitic efficacy.
      <br/>
      Thanks to the demonstrated solubilization of the active principles, in the form of thermostable, oil-in-water emulsions possessing very small micelles in the lowest nanosize region, an excellent bioavailability can be achieved for them.
      <br/>
      In the course of an intensive elaboration of the properties of this class of compounds, it was found that surprisingly also the glycoside peresters of the studied bioflavonoids have comparative pharmacological properties, provided that they are also formulated correspondingly.
      <br/>
      In such manner they can be used for curative as well as preventive purposes.
      <br/>
      Because they are non-toxic and yet highly active, members of this group of natural agents, which up-to-now is only scarcely investigated, these findings can be instrumental in opening a broad therapeutic window.
      <br/>
      The application of the fatty-tail principle for the esterification and the incorporation of the newly obtained glycoside esters into inventive, spontaneously dispersible concentrates form a systematic two step-approach--the extension of a procedure which has already been described in principle in the Swiss patent CH 683'426 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,691) and in the CH patent application 2239-95 (PCT/CH96/00280; EPA 96'925'634-6).
      <br/>
      The subject of the present invention consequently are Flavonol-glycoside peresters as characterized hereafter, their incorporation into pharmaceutically practicable application forms, as well as their use as medicaments having efficacy against tumors, eczemae, psoriasis, viral and parasitic infections and metabolic disorders.

    <p num="7">1.1 Foundations</p>
    <p num="8">
      A selected number of derivatives of QUERCETIN, produced according to formula (I),1 with the glycosides 2, 3, 4, 5, and of its biogenetic precursor ERIODICTYOL (II),6 produced with the glycosides 7 and 8, was made the subject of the present investigation.
      <br/>
      It can firstly be said that these compounds widely occur in dicotyledones (see the tables 8.15 and 11.1 in "The Flavonoids", Ed. J. B. Harborne, T. J. Mabry, H. Mabry, Academic Press, New York 1975) and are, in part at least, easily accessible.
      <br/>
      A second reason is that many of them have quite thoroughly been studied also in medicine (cf. V. Cody, E. Middleton, J. B. Harborne: "Plant Flavonoids in Biology and Medicine", A. R. Liss, New York, 1986).
      <br/>
      Note in particular, that the compounds 4, 7 and 8 are components of the once intensely investigated substance "Vitamin P" (the permeability vitamin); see H. Vogel: "Chemie und Technik der Vitamine", Enke, Stuttgart, 1940.

    <p num="9">1.2 Significance of the Appropriate Solubilization of the Active Principles</p>
    <p num="10">
      In CASE CH-2088/95; PCT/CH97/00168 of Apr. 28, 1997 it was demonstrated for selected bioflavonoid esters that the application of the fatty-tail principle to the formation of derivatives leads to important physicochemical changes in their properties, and particularly to a strongly enhanced lipophilic character, coupled with a noteable depression of the melting point (if compared with the starting material).
      <br/>
      These properties facilitate emulsification and render aqueous ultramicroemulsions of very good stability.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, the targeted delivery (i.e. the bioavailability) and hence also the bioreactivity of the inventive agents are also decisively potentiated.

      <br/>
      Acta Helv. 1945, 20, 154, 174�; later investigations revealed its existence in many plants, particularly in species, which since ancient times were known and used in popular medicine, such as, e.g., in a proportion of 1% in onion peels (Allium cepa L.) �K.

      Chim.Acta 1989, 72, 985�. In the last named cases, spiraeoside contributes decisively to the stabilization of the anthocyanine complexes, which are responsible for colouring.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Despite the general presence of spiraeoside in medicinal plants, the compound has rarely been studied scientifically for its role in traditional popular healing, and no effort was made so far to investigate the pharmaceutical properties of the pure substance.</p>
    <p num="18">
      The chemical structure of spiraeoside as 4'- BETA -D-Glucopyranosylquercetin was determined by E. Steinegger et al. (loc.c.) and by L. Horhammer and R. Hansel, Arch.Pharm. 1954, 287, 36, with the help of classical methods.
      <br/>
      The analytical control, employing modern equipment and methods, was carried out in connection with the purity assay for the freshly isolated starting material which was then esterified as described in the present invention.

      Sufficient quantities of (V) can be obtained from the indicated sources by relatively simple extraction and enrichment steps.
      <br/>
      In the present case, the commercially available drug `Flos Spiraeae ulmariae` was processed.
      <br/>
      Following processes of mild extraction, separation, column chromatography and cristallisation, compound (V) was isolated and subsequently esterified using a fatty acid chloride, in order to obtain compound (VI).
      <br/>
      Of importance is the enhanced stability of the ester function at C(5), as compared to that of Quercetin esters.

    <p num="20">Isolation of Spiraeoside (V)</p>
    <p num="21">
      500 g of `Flos Spiraeae` (Dixa St.Gallen, berries) are kept standing in the percolator with 4 L of methanol-water 4:1 during 2 days.
      <br/>
      The produced, yellowish-brown percolate is evacuated to ca. 250 ml and extracted 4 times in the separatory funnel with 250 ml each time of n-butanol.
      <br/>
      The pooled butanol solutions are then evacuated at 5 Torr, and the oily residue is taken up in 250 ml of acetic acid-water-methanol-ethylacetate 6:34:20:10 and chromatographically purified with a column of 0.8 kg polyamide powder (Macherey-Nagel, SC6) or optionally with water-pyridine 97.5:2.5 on Sephadex G-10 (Pharmacia).

    <p num="39">2.0 Production of Spontaneously Dispersible Concentrates and of Aqueous Ultramicroemulsions</p>
    <p num="40">
      Because of their pronounced lipophilic properties, the described compounds according to the formulae (I) to (VI) are insoluble in water.
      <br/>
      In order to enable them to penetrate the membrane barrier of tumor or host cells and of the protein hull of viruses or parasites and then to spread in the cell plasma and inside the virus/parasite, these compounds must first be solubilized in appropriate manner in the aqueous medium.
      <br/>
      This is achieved over 2 steps: first the production of spontaneously dispersible concentrates, which comprise the active principles as an integrative, micellar component of the system, and second the addition of distilled water, 5%-glucose solution or physiological sodium salt solution (Ringer solution) in a proporition 1:20 to 1:1'000'000.
    </p>
    <p num="41">By preparing thermodynamically stable oil-in-water ultramicroemulsions, employing selected cotensides (i.e. hydrotropic agents) on the one hand, and appropriate tensides (surfactants) on the other hand, it becomes possible to achieve an optimal degree of solubilization of these ester compounds and of their biolociical delivery and hence a high bioavailability and bioreactivity at or in the target cell.</p>
    <p num="42">
      All experimental observations gained with stable ultramicroemulsions of this kind can be uniformly interpreted by means of the concept that the inventive solubilization system produces in the aqueous phase organized aggregates, which are MICELLES.
      <br/>
      These micelles possess a more or less globular shape, having a hydrodynamic radius of less than 10 nm.
      <br/>
      They are thermodynamically stable.
      <br/>
      The tensides and cotensides are capable at the phase-boundary of the microemulsion of hindering SELF-DIFFUSION.
      <br/>
      This means that no mixing takes place between the outer aqueous phase of the microemulsion and its inner, oily phase, which contains the ester compounds according to the formulae (I) to (VI), solubilized in the coemulgator, i.e. the biotenside solvent employed as an essential component of the spontaneously dispersible concentrate.
      <br/>
      In the inner, oily phase, the molecules of the selected esters are thus present in monomeric or in oligomeric form.
      <br/>
      The micelles, which comprise in their micellar core the solubilized active substances, are coated by a tenside layer or bilayer and are thus rendered elastic.
      <br/>
      This enables them to penetrate through the plasma membrane of the tumor cell or the virus- or parasite-infected host cell, and also through the envelope of the virus.
      <br/>
      This diffusion process takes place on account of thermal molecular movements exclusively.
      <br/>
      In biological systems they are not related to metabolic energy.
      <br/>
      The fractal dimensions of these membranes allow the build-up of considerable gradients, i.e of differentials in concentration.
      <br/>
      The velocity of the ensuing diffusion process and the volume of transport through the membrane of the target cells are a function of:
      <br/>
      1. the concentration difference in the two compartments outside and inside the cell
      <br/>
      2. the radius of the particles (i.e. the micelles) enclosing the diffusing active substance
      <br/>
      3. the viscosity of the diffusing aqueous solution (emulsion)
      <br/>
      4. the temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The proper solubilization of the active substances, which are practically insoluble in water, by means of surfactants (coemulgator plus tensides) is a conditio sine qua non for achieving self-diffusion and hence active transport of the biologically effective substances across the membranes of living cells.
      <br/>
      As can be seen from the table, one globular "micelle" having a hydrodynamic radius of one centimeter possesses a volume of 4.189 cm3 and a phase surface of 12.564 cm2. In contradistinction: a number of 1018 micelles having each a hydrodynamic radius of 10-6 cm(=10 nm) only, together possess the same volume of 4.189 cm3 and yet cover up a total phase surface of 1'256.4 m2.

    <p num="46">Conclusion</p>
    <p num="47">
      Due to the enormous total surface area, which is taken up in the inventive ultramicroemulsions by the micelles having a hydrodynamic radius of 2.2 to 3.0 nm, in addition to the increased diffusion capability, also the Theological distribution (the "spreading") is significantly enhanced.
      <br/>
      Hence, the bioavailability, as well as the bioreactivity of the antitumor agents carried in the core of the micelles (and maintained there in monomeric or oligmeric solution), are also notably improved.
      <br/>
      This will allow a considerable reduction of the critical dosage required.
      <br/>
      This, in turn, causes a reduction or complete elimination of unwanted, disturbing side-effects.

    <p num="48">
      The "packing density" achieved with the spontaneously dispersible, stable MARIGENOL.RTM.-concentrates obeys the exponential relationship illustrated above: the smaller the particle size of the micelles, the greater the packing density obtainable.
      <br/>
      Of decisive importance is the correct formation of the inner phase, its balanced proportion with respect to the entire concentrate and the choice of the suitable tensides.

      2.1 The inventive spontaneously dispersible concentrates comprise:

      The inventive aqueous ultramicroemulsions comprise:

      0.1 to 5% by weight of a spontaneously dispersible concentrate as defined above,
      <br/>
      85 to 99.9% by weight of distilled water, physiological sodium salt solution (Ringer solution) or 5% glucose solution,
      <br/>
      up to 10% by weight of carriers, customary excipients and/or diluents.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      These aqueous ultramicroemulsions are characterized by the following properties: a reduced surface tension of 28-32 mNm-1, a low inner viscosity (showing a dynamic viscosity  ETA  at 20 (degree)  C. around 1.0 cP=10-3 Pa.s), a very small and homogenous particle size and a good thermodynamic stability (no coalescence, no agglomeration of the micelles, no autocondensation of the tensides; that is to say that no "self assembly" is occurring as due to the chemical degradation of the tensides).
      <br/>
      The active principles are found in monomeric or oligomeric solution, packed in the micellar core.
      <br/>
      Due to the balanced proportions, even with very high degrees of dilution, the tenside coated umbrella of the micelles is preserved.
      <br/>
      This also prevents so-called "instability or Marangoni effects".
      <br/>
      Thanks to these properties, the inventive ultramicroemulsions permit high capillary diffusion.
      <br/>
      Their penetration potential at the cell membrane of defective or abnormal cells is excellent and is followed by very good spreading (rheological distribution) inside the cell.
      <br/>
      The consequence is that the described solubilization system makes for a high bioavailability and hence also bioreactivity of the active principles which are carried in it, coupled with a reduced or no toxicity at all.

      The surfactants or surfactant mixtures to be employed according to the invention can be anionic, cationic, amphoteric or non-ionic.
      <br/>
      Ideally, they are non-ionic and have an HLB-value (i.e. a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) of between 2 and 18; preferably, it is between 2 and 6 on the one hand and 10 and 15 on the other hand.
      <br/>
      HLB values describe the hydrophilic and lipophilic properties of an emulsifier.

    <p num="53">
      Suitable anionic surfactants can be both so-called water-soluble soaps and water-soluble synthetic compounds.
      <br/>
      Suitable soaps are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or optionally substituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids (C12-22), for example the natural Na or K salts of oleic or stearic acids, or of natural mixtures of fatty acids which can be obtained, inter alia, from coconut oil or tallow oil.
      <br/>
      Other surfactants which may be mentioned are fatty acid methyltaurine salts, and modified and non-modified phospholipids.
      <br/>
      However, more frequently used surfactants are so-called synthetic surfactants, in particular fatty sulfonates, fatty sulfates, sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives or alkylaryl-sulfonates.
      <br/>
      The fatty sulfonates and fatty sulfates are usually present in the form of alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or optionally substituted ammonium salts and generally have an alkyl radical containing 8 to 22 C atoms, alkyl also encompassing the alkyl moiety of acyl radicals.
      <br/>
      Examples are the Na or Ca salt of ligninsulfonic acid, of dodecylsulfuric ester and sulfonic acids of fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide adducts.
      <br/>
      The sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives preferably contain two sulfonyl groups and one fatty acid radical containing about 8 to 22 C atoms.
      <br/>
      Alkylarylsulfonates are, for example, the Na, Ca or triethanolamine salts of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, of dibutyl-naphthalene-sulfonic acid or of a naphthalenesulfonic acid/formaldehyde condensation product.
      <br/>
      The non-ionic surfactants are mainly chosen from amongst the polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and alkylphenols which can contain 3 to 30 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20 C atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon radical and 6 to 18 C atoms in the alkyl radical.
      <br/>
      Other suitable non-ionic surfactants are the water-soluble polyethyleneoxy-adducts onto polypropylene glycol and alkyl polypropylene glycol with 1 to 10 C atoms in the alkyl chain, which adducts contain 20 to 250 ethylene glycol ether groups and 10 to 100 propylene ether groups.
      <br/>
      The compounds which have been mentioned customarily contain 1 to 5 ethylene units per propylene glycol unit.
      <br/>
      The following may be mentioned as examples of non-ionic surfactants: nonylphenol polyethoxyethanols, castor oil polyglycol ethers, polypropylene/polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylphenoxy-polyethoxy-ethanol, polyethylene glycol and octylphenoxy-polyethoxyethanol.
      <br/>
      Moreover, fatty acid esters of polyoxyethylene-sorbitan, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate, are also suitable.
      <br/>
      The cationic surfactants are mainly quaternary ammonium salts which contain at least one alkyl radical having 8 to 22 C atoms as the N-substituent and which have lower, optionally halogenated alkyl radicals, benzyl radicals or lower hydroxyalkyl radicals as further substituents.
      <br/>
      The salts are mainly present in the form of halides, methylsulfates or ethylsulfates, for example stearyltrimethylammonium chloride or benzyldi-(2-chloro-ethyl)-ethyl-ammonium bromide.

    <p num="73">3.1 In-Vitro Assays Using Suitable Tumour Cell Lines</p>
    <p num="74">
      A biological assay system using microtiter plates and serial dilutions has been developed.
      <br/>
      Batches of 104 tumour cells per ml were set up in culture medium RPMI 1640 and inactivated with 10% of fetal calf serum (GIBCO); they are spread at a density low enough to enable them to grow during the assay, in so-called non-confluent monolayers.
      <br/>
      Samples are added after 6 to 24 h, with 100  MU l per row, to which 100  MU l of medium are added in the first well.
      <br/>
      Half of this mixture is withdrawn, transferred into the next well and again treated with 100  MU l of medium, etc.
      <br/>
      This results in an n1/2 geometrical serial dilution.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      In the plaque assay, the samples are incubated at 37 (degree)  C. for 3 to 5 days under 31/2% of CO2.
      <br/>
      They are then stained and fixed using 0.1% crystal violet (Fluka, Buchs) in a solution of 70% of methanol, 1% of formaldehyde and 29% of water.
      <br/>
      The samples are evaluated under the microscope, magnification 300 * .
      <br/>
      The greatest cytotoxic dilution is determined.
      <br/>
      The samples can also be evaluated quantitatively by means of scanning and absorption measurement in a spectrophotometer.

      The aim was to find out whether there was selective activity in-vitro against Trypanosoma rhodesiense (the agent of sleeping sickness), against Trypanosoma cruzi (the agent of Chagas-disease) and against Leishmania donovani (the agent of leishmaniasis).
      <br/>
      Tests were conducted at concentrations which don't induce basal cytotoxicity on murine muscle cells or macrophages.
