      A dive boot for wearing with swim fins and having a felt sole to prevent slipping on underwater objects when entering the water without the fin.
    </p>
  </abstract>
  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">This invention relates to a boot for swimming, snorkeling or scuba diving, and more particularly to an improved dive boot to be used both for entering the water from the shore on foot and to be used together with swim fins or flippers.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      When swimming, snorkeling or scuba diving, dive boots are often worn to protect the feet from injury on foreign objects, as well as for warmth in colder waters.
      <br/>
      Dive boots are shaped to be worn together with swim fins or flippers of the type having a toe entry pocket and means for heel attachment, such as a strap or heel cup.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Entry into the water from the shore is difficult while wearing swim fins, particularly in a heavy surf.
      <br/>
      The diver usually enters the water on foot, carrying the swim fins and then puts them on after negotiating the shallow water.
      <br/>
      Entry on foot is difficult, and sometimes dangerous, due to foreign objects in the water, which are often slippery.
      <br/>
      The diver may encounter rocks covered with barnacles and algae, seaweed, shells, and other dangerous debris such as broken glass.
      <br/>
      Prior art dive boots normally are made with synthetic rubber soles having corrugated bottoms or treads.
      <br/>
      While these offer protection to the feet and are puncture resistant, the soles of prior art dive boots are notably slippery in spite of the corrugated treads.
      <br/>
      Also the rubber soles are flexible and produce fatigue when used with fins for a long time.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Wading shoes or wading boots are also known, which offer improved traction on slippery surfaces.
      <br/>
      Wading shoes or boots are available with felt soles having an instep and heel configured in the manner of an ordinary walking shoe.
      <br/>

      It would be desirable to have a dive boot which especially useful both for walking on slippery surfaces when entering the water, as well as to be used with a swim fin for a dive boot.
      <br/>
      It would also be desirable to have a dive boot which reduces fatigue when swimming with fins over the boot.

    <p num="7">Accordingly, one object of the invention is to provide an improved dive boot both for walking on slippery surfaces and for wearing with a swim fin.</p>
    <p num="8">Another object of the invention is to provide an improved dive boot which reduces fatigue when worn with swim fins.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      Briefly stated, the invention comprises an improved dive boot to be used both for shore entry and with a swim fin of the type having a toe entry pocket and heel attachment means, the dive boot comprising an upper boot member of water resistant fabric having a substantially smooth toe piece adapted to enter the swim fin toe entry pocket, an intermediate sole member attached to the bottom of the upper boot member, and a bottom sole member comprising felt attached to the intermediate sole member, the bottom sole member having a substantially flat lower surface.
      <br/>
      Preferably the felt is a synthetic felt of uniform thickness woven of polyester and nylon and beveled along its periphery to facilitate entry of the boot toe piece into a swim flipper toe entry pocket.

      <br/>
      FIG. 5 is a perspective view of the dive boot according to present invention together with a swim fin, and

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="11">
      Referring now to FIG. 1 of the drawing, a prior art dive boot 10 comprises an upper boot member 12, which is manufactured of water resistant fabric, which may be stretchable fabric and provided with a side closure member such as a zipper (not shown).
      <br/>
      Dive boot 10 has a heavy sole 14 of natural or synthetic rubber, molded to include corrugations or ridges 16 to prevent slipping and add traction.
      <br/>
      The corrugations 16 run laterally across the boot and provide flexibility at the arch 18.
      <br/>
      When used with a swim fin, the flexible arch 18 sometimes increases fatigue because of the effort required to move the foot against the resistance of the water to the swim fin.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 2 illustrates the dive boot of the present invention, which is shown generally at 20, to comprise an upper boot member 22, an intermediate sole member 24 and a bottom sole member 26.
      <br/>
      Upper boot member 22 comprises a toe piece 28 and an ankle sheath 30, the latter being supplied with a closure device such as a zipper 32.
      <br/>
      The upper boot member is made of water resistant, flexible fabric, such as woven Neoprene material, which may also be stretchable.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Intermediate sole member 24 is preferably made of synthetic rubber and is attached to the bottom of the upper boot member by adhesive in a manner well known in the art.</p>
    <p num="14">In accordance with the present invention, a bottom sole member 26 of felt is attached to the intermediate sole member 24, preferably with an adhesive.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Reference to the cross sectional drawing of FIG. 3 illustrates that the intermediate sole member 24 is substantially flat on its bottom surface, and that the felt bottom sole member is of substantially uniform Ahickness.
      <br/>
      The periphery of the felt bottom sole member is beveled inwardly toward the bottom surface away from the boot, as indicated at 32 to facilitate entry of the boot into a swim fin toe entry pocket.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The preferable material for the bottom sole member 32 comprises a felt member approximately 3/8" uniform thickness made from a needled blend of 60% polyester and 40% nylon.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the bottom sole member is attached to the intermediate sole member with a rubber adhesive, or a two part adhesive consisting of polyester and polyether.
    </p>
    <p num="17">FIG. 4 is an enlarged cross section view showing the details of the upper boot member 22, the intermediate sole member 24 and the bottom sole member 26.</p>
    <heading>OPERATION</heading>
    <p num="18">
      Referring now to the perspective drawings of FIGS. 5 and 6, the improved dive boot 20 with felt bottom sole 26 is worn without fins while entering the water.
      <br/>
      Felt sole 26 prevents, or substantially reduces, slipping on underwater objects.
      <br/>
      The boot is constructed to be worn with a swim fin shown generally at 34 comprised of synthetic rubber or plastic, and of a type well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Fin 34 comprises a flipper portion 36, a toe entry pocket 38, and heel attachment means such as strap 40.
      <br/>
      Swim fin 34 is carried while entering the water.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 6 shows the dive boot 20 with toe piece 28 inserted into the toe entry pocket 38 and strap 40 secured in place around the heel of dive boot 20 to hold it securely in the toe pocket.
      <br/>
      The toe piece and beveled felt sole 26 are shaped and contoured to facilitate entry of the dive boot into the toe pocket.
      <br/>
      During diving and swimming, the flat felt sole 26 provides rigidity and reduces fatigue while manipulating the fins.
      <br/>
      The felt sole is also useful for avoiding slipping while wearing the swim fins, because the back part of the bottom sole remains exposed.
    </p>
    <p num="20">While there has been described what is considered to be the preferred embodiment of the invention, other modifications will occur to those skilled in the art, and it is desired to secure in the appended claims all such modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
