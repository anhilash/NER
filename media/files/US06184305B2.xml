      A radiation absorbing polymer is characterized by having a main chain copolymer containing recurring units of dicarboxylic acid or carboxylic anhydride group with an organic chromophore bonded to the carboxyl group through methylene or alkylene linkage group, where the organic chromophore is bonded to the carboxyl group by esterification reaction.

      Residual carboxyl groups of the radiation absorbing polymer can optionally be amidized and/or imidized with an aromatic compounds having a reactive amino group.
      <br/>
      When the photoresist is applied on the antireflective coating and is exposed by radiation such as deep ultraviolet radiation, a resist pattern with high resolving power is formed, which is not affected by standing wave upon manufacturing integrated circuit elements.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to a radiation absorbing polymer which absorbs the predetermined wavelength radiation, comprised of a polymer having chemically bonded thereto an organic chromophore, a film forming composition containing the radiation absorbing polymer, an antireflective coating formed from the film forming composition and, more particularly, to an antireflective coating being useful upon manufacturing integrated circuit elements by photo-lithography and to a process for preparing a novel polymer containing a radiation-absorbing chromophore compound.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In the field of manufacturing integrated circuit elements, photo-lithographic process is essential.
      <br/>
      In order to attain a higher degree of integration in manufacturing the integrated circuit elements, patterning technology to form still finer patterns by the photo-lithographic process has been studied and, in recent years, such studies have lead to development of a technology enabling submicron-ordered fine patterning.
      <br/>
      In such photo-lithographic process, a photoresist is applied to a substrate, a latent image of a mask pattern is created in the photoresist using a reduction projection exposure apparatus, then the latent image is developed using a proper developer solution to obtain a patterned resist with the desired width and pattern.
      <br/>
      However, many substrates used in the field of manufacturing integrated circuit elements have such a high reflectivity that, upon exposure, exposing light passing through the photoresist layer is reflected on the surface of the substrate and is again incident into the photoresist layer, which causes problems that desired patterns are not obtained or that patterns with some defects are formed due to the exposure by the reflected light of photoresist areas which is not to be exposed originally or due to the existence of standing wave formed by interference between the reflected light and the incident light.
      <br/>
      Various techniques have been investigated to solve the problems.
      <br/>
      For example, there have been attempted a technique of addition of dye having absorption at the exposure wavelength into the resist to reduce the amount of light passing through the resist and consequently reduce the amount of reflected light, and a technique of forming an antireflective layer between the resist and a substrate in order to prevent light reflection from the substrate into resist by absorbing light having reached to the surface of the substrate upon exposure.
      <br/>
      As the latter type techniques, there are illustrated a technique of forming a coating of an inorganic compound having radiation absorbing properties such as titanium nitride according to CVD method or vacuum deposition method or the like; a technique of forming an antireflective coating on a substrate by applying an organic polymer solution containing a light-absorbing dye dispersed or dissolved therein to the surface of the substrate; and a technique of using, as an antireflective layer, a radiation absorbing polymer wherein a chromophore of dye is chemically bonded to a backbone polymer, or a polymer which itself has a radiation absorbing property.
      <br/>
      As to the technique of using a radiation absorbing polymer and the materials used for it, related descriptions are given in, for example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication Nos.
      <br/>
      H6-75378 and H6-118656, WO 9412912, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,910,122 and 5,057,399, etc.
      <br/>
      Recently, organic materials, particularly those wherein a chromophore is chemically bonded to a polymer skeleton, are being regarded as most promising, and then research and partly application have been being examined.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      A general resist patterning process using the above-described organic antireflective layer is conducted in the following manner.
      <br/>
      Firstly, a solution for forming the antireflective layer is applied to a substrate and baked to thereby make the antireflective layer insoluble in a solvent for photoresist.
      <br/>
      Secondly, a photoresist coating is formed on the antireflective coating and, after subjecting to processes of exposure, development, etc., there is obtained a resist pattern on the antireflective layer.
      <br/>
      Then, the antireflective coating of the resist-free areas where the originally applied resist layer has been removed by the development is removed by dry etching.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Many conventionally known radiation absorbing polymers wherein a dye is chemically bonded to a skeletal polymer have a low solubility in solvents used for resists, and hence solvents being different from those used for resists, such as cyclohexanone, are often employed as a solvent for the radiation absorbing polymer.
      <br/>
      However, in case that a solvent used for forming the antireflective coating is different from that for photoresist, there may arise problems that process steps for forming the antireflective coating in manufacturing integrated circuits increase in number, process equipments become more complicated and, in some cases, properties of the resist layer themselves are adversely affected.
      <br/>
      For example, when the antireflective coating and the photoresist layer are formed by using the same coating apparatus as is often conducted, the solvent for photoresist composition must fully be washed off from the coating apparatus before coating the antireflective coating composition.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, materials for forming the antireflective coating might be precipitated due to the influence of mixing of the antireflective coating composition and remaining photoresist solution upon coating the antireflective coating composition.
      <br/>
      The precipitate thus formed might close up pipes for waste liquor, or might scatter as fine powder and deposit on the resist surface coated or antireflective coating surface, resulting in deterioration of quality such as deformation of resist pattern.
      <br/>
      Further, since two different solvents are used, two pipe lines for feeding a solvent for washing backside and periphery of substrate might, in some cases, be required; one line for antireflective coating, and the other line for resist.
      <br/>
      For example, with an antireflective composition using a polymer described in the aforesaid Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. H6-75378 wherein an amino aromatic compound is chemically bonded to a polymer skeleton having acid anhydride groups, there involves a problem that, since the composition well dissolves in cyclohexanone and scarcely dissolves in a solvent for resist, there is a disadvantage that edge rinsing is hard to be conducted by using the same coating apparatus as is used for coating the resist.
      <br/>
      In addition, an antireflective coating composition containing a low molecular weight dye dispersed in a polymer has also been developed.
      <br/>
      Such composition, however, often causes unevenness in coating thickness when coated on a surface of a substrate with difference in level, thus these problems are being desired to be improved.
      <br/>
      As is described hereinbefore, there has been eagerly desired to provide a radiation absorbing polymer which has a strong radiation absorbing property for predetermined wavelength radiation and shows excellent photo-lithographic processability, which is soluble in the same solvent as that used for photoresist, and which can form a uniform coating in thickness on a substrate with complicated uneven surface; a film forming composition containing the radiation absorbing polymer; and an antireflective coating formed from the film forming composition and having good properties.
    </p>
    <p num="5">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a radiation absorbing polymer adapted for forming an antireflective coating which shows high solubility for a solvent for photoresist, good uniformity coating thickness on a uneven surface, high antireflectivity, good adhesion, good dry etch-ability and good heat resistance, which enables one to form a resist pattern with excellent resolution, and to provide a process for preparing the polymer.</p>
    <p num="6">Another object of the present invention is to provide an antireflective coating which shows high antireflectivity, good adhesion, good dry etch-ability and good heat resistance, which enables one to form a resist pattern with excellent resolution through improved manufacturing steps.</p>
    <p num="7">A further object of the present invention is to provide a film forming composition adapted for forming the antireflective coating which can form an uniform antireflective coating in thickness even on a surface of a substrate with difference in level.</p>

      Of these, aminoanthracene is preferred as materials for KrF eximer laser antireflective coatings due to their strong absorption for a KrF eximer laser (248 nm).
      <br/>
      In the present invention, however, the compounds having an reactive amino group may not necessarily have absorption in the predetermined region, since those which can improve polymer properties such as film forming property besides improving radiation absorbing property of a resulting polymer may also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      On the other hand, the film forming composition of the present invention contains the above-described radiation absorbing polymer and is usually prepared by dissolving the radiation absorbing polymer in a proper solvent mainly to utilize as a bottom reflection-preventing coating upon manufacture of integrated circuits.
      <br/>
      In the case of using the radiation absorbing polymer of the present invention for manufacturing the integrated circuits, those which have a strong absorption in the wavelength region of from 180 to 450 nm are preferred for exposure source of UV or deep UV.
      <br/>
      Therefore, compounds represented by the above formula 4 and, if necessary, compounds represented by formula 7 are selected so that the resulting radiation absorbing polymer can absorb radiation of 180 to 450 nm in wavelength.
      <br/>
      Use of such polymer capable of strongly absorbing radiation of such wavelengths enables absorption of radiation used for exposure by the antireflective coating, thereby reflection of exposure radiation from the substrate being prevented and defect-free resist pattern being formed.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      As preferred examples of solvents for obtaining the film forming composition, there are illustrated methyl ethyl ketone (MEK),  GAMMA -butyrolactone, dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone, ethyl lactate (EL), methoxypropanol (PGME), propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA), cyclohexanone and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      However, solvents to be used in this invention are not limited only to them.
      <br/>
      Of these solvents,  GAMMA -butyrolactone, EL, PGME, PGMEA, and a mixture of PGME and PGMEA are particularly preferred.

      Concentration of the radiation absorbing polymer in the composition is 20% by weight or less.

    <p num="46">
      In the case of preparing the film forming composition using the radiation absorbing polymer of the present invention, conventionally known low molecular compounds such as radiation absorbing compounds, adhesion promoters, etc. or polymer materials may optionally be added to the composition.
      <br/>
      As the examples of the low molecular compounds, surfactants or silane series leveling agents may be used in small amounts for adjusting adhesion to a substrate and coating properties.
      <br/>
      In the case of adding a compound of formula 7 having a reactive amino group, solubility of the baked coating for a resist solvent is further reduced.
      <br/>
      In the case of adding the compound having a reactive amino group, it is added in an amount of preferably 0.1 to 1.0 part by weight based on 1 part by weight of the radiation absorbing polymer.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferably, where acid anhydride groups and/or dicarboxylic acid groups partly remain, molar ratio of the reactive amino group to sum of the remaining acid anhydride groups and/or dicarboxylic acid groups is about 1:1.
      <br/>
      The reason why solubility of the coating decreases by the addition of the compound having a reactive amino group is not clear.
      <br/>
      However, it may be attributed to the reaction of the carboxylic acid groups or acid anhydride groups remaining in the polymer with the compound having a reactive amino group, which, however, is not to be construed as limiting the present invention.

      In forming the antireflective coating, the thus prepared film forming composition is applied to a substrate in a dry film thickness of 500 to 50,000  Angstrom  by spin coating, cast coating, roller coating or the like, then baked to make it insoluble in a photoresist solvent.
      <br/>
      The baking is conducted at a temperature of, for example, about 90 to about 250 (degree)  C., preferably 180 to 200 (degree)  C.

      A photoresist is applied to the antireflective coating thus formed on the substrate in a predetermined thickness, then prebaked to form a photoresist layer.

      Solvents to be used for the photoresist include EL, PGMEA and ketones, though not being limited only to them.
      <br/>
      As the photoresist, either positive working or negative working photoresists may be used.
      <br/>
      Prebaking temperature varies depending upon the kind of photoresist to be used, but is usually about 30 to about 200 (degree)  C. Kind of radiation for exposure of the photoresist can be selected from among visible lights, UV rays, deep UV rays, X-rays, electron beams, etc., but as the radiation absorbing polymer to be used for forming the antireflective coating, those polymers which absorb the radiation of wavelengths required for exposure, as has been described hereinbefore are selected.
      <br/>
      After the patterned exposure, the photoresist is subjected to development optionally after post-exposure baking, thus a resist pattern being formed.
      <br/>
      Then, the antireflective coating is dry etched using gas plasma such as oxygen plasma thereby to form a resist pattern that serves to process or treat the substrate.
      <br/>

      The radiation absorbing polymer of the present invention shows a good absorption for radiation of predetermined wavelengths, can form an antireflective coating having a good adhesion to substrate, and is soluble in a solvent for a photoresist.

      Hence, the polymer is greatly advantageous for users.

      Therefore, it is not easily removed during wet development of the resist.

      In addition, this coating can be formed easily and can be removed with ease by dry etching using the resist pattern as an etching mask.

      Baking after the exposure was conducted at 70 (degree)  C. for 90 seconds, and development was conducted in a 2.38 wt % solution of TMAH of 23 (degree)  C. for 60 seconds.
      <br/>
      Observation of the thus-obtained resist patterns under electron microscope revealed that standing wave of the resist profile due to reflection of exposure radiation from the substrate did not appear, and that a vertical resist profile was obtained.
      <br/>
      Thus, the polymer material of the present invention can also provide a material adapted for KrF wavelength exposure by selecting a proper radiation absorbing dye.
