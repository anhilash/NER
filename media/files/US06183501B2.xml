    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates, in general, to the field of head, neck, and spine medical treatment, and more particularly, to a cooling device for the brain and spinal cord of an individual with a brain or spinal cord injury for reducing trauma to those areas.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is described in connection with brain and spinal cord treatment, as an example.</p>
    <p num="3">
      The brain and spinal cord form the central nervous system (CNS), the body's chief controlling and coordinating centers.
      <br/>
      The brain, which is housed in the skull, is the major organ of the body for control of all the body's voluntary and involuntary activities.
      <br/>
      The principal parts of the brain are the brain stem, the diencephalon, the cerebrum, and the cerebellum.
      <br/>
      Cranial bones and the cranial meninges protect the brain and cerebrospinal fluid serves as a shock absorber for the brain and circulates nutritive substances from the blood to the brain.
      <br/>
      A large round hole called the foramen magnum is located at the bottom of the skull.
      <br/>
      It is through the foramen magnum that the spinal cord passes down from the brain into the spine.
      <br/>
      The spine is a bony column which serves as a protective surrounding for the spinal cord.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      When an area of the body collides with an external source in its surroundings, severe trauma and swelling of the tissue may occur in the injured area.
      <br/>
      To reduce swelling, treatment often consists of lowering the temperature of the injured area.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Lowering temperature is often achieved by applying a cold element or substance to the injured area.
      <br/>
      In some instances, the treatment has been as simple as applying ice to the location of the injury.
      <br/>
      More sophisticated methods have included applying cold packs to the injury.
      <br/>
      Heretofore, in this field, cold therapy has generally been limited to the limbs of the body including the leg (particularly the knee), the arm, and the shoulder.
      <br/>
      Treatment of this type has generally been applied most consistently in situations involving athletic injuries.
      <br/>
      Cold therapy has also been used for aesthetic purposes such as applying cold packs to the face to reduce bags under the eyes and for purposes of reducing the pain of headaches.
      <br/>
      Therapy has generally required refrigeration of the packs.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      When the brain or spinal cord is traumatized due to injury, the extent of the trauma to the brain or spinal cord is not always readily apparent.
      <br/>
      The collision of an individual's head with external surroundings causes the brain to collide with the individual's skull, which may produce welling of the brain.
      <br/>
      Swelling can restrict the flow of fluids that normally circulate around the brain and, potentially, cause the fluids to accumulate and therefore compress the brain down into the floor of the skull and cervical bone of the spine.
      <br/>
      The collision of the individual's head or body with external surroundings may cause injury to the spinal cord and result in swelling.
      <br/>
      To reduce the effects of this secondary trauma, the present invention can be placed over the head, neck, and spinal regions to lower the temperature in those areas and help reduce swelling.
      <br/>
      The reduced swelling of the brain reduces the potential for more serious injury to the individual.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Therefore, there is a need for a device that may be easily transported and applied in emergency situations but may also be used in rehabilitative environments.
      <br/>
      Also, there is a need for a device that requires no special storage conditions such that implementation of such a device requires extensive redesign of, or requires, additional space for storage facilities.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, there is a need for a device that may be flexibly and easily adapted to a individual at the scene of an accident while not adding additional stress or pressure on the individual.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention disclosed herein is a cooling system that includes a head and neck device which can be cooled to reduce trauma to the brain.
      <br/>
      The cooling device facilitates cooling of the head and neck which reduces swelling of the brain.
      <br/>
      Reduction of swelling of the brain helps to decrease both short and long term damage to the brain of a patient.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In one embodiment, the cooling system includes a head device and a neck brace.
      <br/>
      The head device has a front panel and a back panel; each panel capable of housing a cold element to facilitate cooling.
      <br/>
      The front panel may include a plurality of fastening devices to secure the head device to the head of the individual.
      <br/>
      The front panel may also include a plurality of orifices to facilitate access to the ears of the individual.
      <br/>
      The back panel of the head piece may include a plurality of fastening devices and a bottom appendage; the fastening device being positioned to come into contact with the plurality of fastening devices located on the front panel for complete coverage of the head and over the carotid arteries.
      <br/>
      The back panel may be elongated by attaching a back panel strip that covers the back along the spinal cord for cooling.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The cooling system may also include a neck brace having front and back brace members and a chin support.
      <br/>
      The neck brace may further include a plurality of orifices that allow air to circulate to reduce heat buildup which may cause sweating and discomfort of the individual.
      <br/>
      The neck brace may also have a hole for, e.g., facilitating a tracheotomy to assist the individual in breathing, if necessary.
      <br/>
      The neck brace may also include a fastening device to secure the neck brace to the individual and to support the head device.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In another embodiment, the cooling system of the present invention may be a one-piece head device.
      <br/>
      The head device includes an opening for facial exposure and is capable of housing a cooling element.
      <br/>
      The head device further includes a flexible material.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In yet another embodiment, the cooling system of the present invention comprises a cooling device and a cooling element system.
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The present invention disclosed herein includes a head device and a cooling medium for cooling the head and spine.
      <br/>
      Cooling of the head and spine facilitates a reduction in swelling of the brain and surrounding tissue after injury, which helps to minimize long term damage to the brain.
      <br/>
      The present invention also encompasses a method for using the head device and for activating the cooling material to facilitate cooling of the brain after an injury.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      It has been reported that approximately 20 percent of all head injuries are classified as severe and hence may be potentially life threatening.
      <br/>
      The overall effects of traumatic brain injuries are permanent and complex, thus, management of traumatic brain injury is of critical importance.
      <br/>
      Management of the effects of the injuries during the critical time period following severe brain injury or during what professionals in emergency medicine have termed the golden hour affects the survival and recovery of those individuals.
      <br/>
      This golden hour includes the time the patient is at the scene of the accident and the essential field stabilization and transport of the individual to a medical facility.
      <br/>
      The golden hour also includes a window of opportunity to determine how extensive the damage is to the brain.
      <br/>
      Neurologists may need to perform a CT scan to evaluate the extent of damage to the brain and to determine if there are bleeds, lesions contusions to the brain, and/or fractures to the skull.
      <br/>
      On-scene intervention also includes procedures that are as unobtrusive as possible and limit damage to the brain.
      <br/>
      Current emergency protocols require checking airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC's)followed by neck and spinal stabilization when neck and back injury appears to be evident before transport.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 1 is a cross sectional view of the brain with cerebrospinal fluid.
      <br/>
      The brain 12, as well as the spinal cord 14, is generally protected against injury by cerebrospinal fluid 16.
      <br/>
      The cerebrospinal fluid 16 circulates through the subarachnoid space 18 that is around the brain 12 and spinal cord 14.
      <br/>
      The cerebrospinal fluid 16 also circulates through the brain 12 via ventricles 20.
      <br/>
      Normally, cerebrospinal fluid 16 is absorbed as rapidly as it is formed.
      <br/>
      Cerebrospinal fluid generally leaves the body at the same rate it is produced, about 0.47 milliliters per hour, through the arachnoid space 18 at the top of the skull 15.
      <br/>
      The cerebrospinal fluid 16 is a clear, colorless, fluid having a watery consistency and contains vital nutrients including proteins, glucose, salts, and white blood cells.
      <br/>
      The cerebrospinal fluid 16 also circulates nutrients delivered via the blood.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      FIG. 1a is a cross sectional view of a brain having swelled against the skull 15 designated as 22.
      <br/>
      When a brain injury occurs there is primary physical damage that can kill or disable.
      <br/>
      But there are also secondary insults to the brain 12, which result from the swelling of the brain 12.
      <br/>
      When swelling occurs, the brain 12 will swell against the skull 15, thus blocking the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid 16 around the brain 12 and blocking the flow of nutrients through the ventricles 20.
      <br/>
      The internal pressure builds and squeezes blood vessels blocking the flow of blood which carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain.
      <br/>
      A reduction in the flow of nutrients to the brain 12 also causes secondary damage to the brain 12.
      <br/>
      The build up of fluids 16 causes inter-cranial pressure (ICP) to build and the brain swells against the skull and blocks the exit point of cerebrospinal fluid 16.
      <br/>
      The brain also becomes damaged by pressing against the wall of the skull.
      <br/>
      All of the above cause additional or secondary injury to the brain.
      <br/>
      The elevation of the heart rate increases more blood to the injured area of the brain, thereby causing more damage due to swelling and the presence of blood destroying brain cells.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The present inventor has recognized that application of a cold element to the head, neck, and/or spine reduces the swelling of the brain and spinal cord after an injury and reduces the increased flow of blood by means of cooling the carotid artery.
      <br/>
      Reducing swelling is particularly important in emergency situations such as vehicle accidents which involve head and/or spinal cord injuries as there is eminent potential for build up of blood and cerebrospinal fluid in the cranial cavity.
      <br/>
      Damage is further intensified because the heart rate is increased as a natural response to trauma, thereby increasing profusion pressure (more blood to the injured site).
      <br/>
      In the case of penetrating or open head injuries, the problem of increased pressure due to blockage or exit capabilities is naturally reduced as the skull has been penetrated, but reducing the flow of blood to the area may help to reduce the amount of hemorrhaging.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of one embodiment of the present invention as placed on an accident individual.
      <br/>
      The accident individual 10 is found immobile at the scene of the accident.
      <br/>
      Emergency Medical Services (EMS) has standard guidelines by which treatment is administered to brain and spinal cord injury individuals.
      <br/>
      EMS will perform the ABC's and make an assessment using the Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) which assesses the person's level of consciousness by eye opening, visual tracking, response to pain, and environmental stimulation to determine if a brain injury is suspected.
      <br/>
      If the person is unconscious, the stabilization of the head, neck, and back is completed.
      <br/>
      EMS personnel will be able to place the cooling system 24 on the head of the individual 10 in order to reduce intercranial pressure consequently reducing trauma to the brain and in turn, reducing or minimizing brain damage.
      <br/>
      The cooling system 24 is mounted on the head and neck of individual 10 through the use of head device 30 and neck brace 32.
      <br/>
      The cooling system 24 stabilizes and cools the head and neck of individual 10.
      <br/>
      The use of the cooling system 24 can be used in addition to current neurological protocols as an effort to reduce the need for a shunt, thereby reducing the need for invasive procedures to an already injured site.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring to FIG. 3, the head device 30 includes a top panel 34, a back panel 36, and a back panel strip 37 all of which are made of flexible material 38.
