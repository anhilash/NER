      This invention discloses novel surface release layers on temporary image receptors particularly suited to the requirements of liquid electrographic (both electrophotographic and electrostatic) printing on a variety of receptors.
      <br/>
      The inventive temporary image receptors are comprised of a surface release layer on a photoreceptive or dielectric substrate.
      <br/>
      The release layers are silicone copolymers which are chemically modified to improve imaging, drying or transfer performance when used in the simplified color electrophotography (SCE) or electrostatic printing processes.

    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to temporary image receptors for printing processes using liquid toner, and particularly electrostatic, electrophotographic, and ionographic imaging processes.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Numerous temporary image receptors are known in the art of printing.
      <br/>
      For example, in offset printing intermediate transfer blankets are used to temporarily store a printed liquid toner image prior to transferring that image to a final receptor.
      <br/>
      Temporary image receptors are also used for electrographic imaging, which is known in the art to include electrophotographic, electrostatic and ionographic printing.
    </p>
    <p num="5">1) Electrophotography:</p>
    <p num="6">
      Electrophotography forms the technical basis for various well known processes, including photocopying and some forms of laser printing.
      <br/>
      The basic electrophotographic process involves placing a uniform electrostatic charge on a photoconductive element (also referred to as a photoconductor element or a photoreceptor), imagewise exposing the photoconductive element to activating electromagnetic radiation, also referred to herein as "light", thereby dissipating the charge in the exposed areas, developing the resulting electrostatic latent image with a toner, and transferring the toner image from the photoconductor element to a final substrate, such as paper, either by direct transfer or via an intermediate transfer material.
      <br/>
      Liquid toners are often preferable because they are capable of giving higher resolution images.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In electrophotographic printing, particularly liquid electrophotographiic printing, the temporary receptor is a photoreceptor.
      <br/>
      The structure of a photoreceptive element may be a continuous belt, which is supported and circulated by rollers, or a rotatable drum.
      <br/>
      All pliotoreceptors have a photoconductive layer which conducts electric current when exposed to activating electromagnetic radiation.
      <br/>
      The photoconductive layer is generally affixed to an electroconductive support.
      <br/>
      The surface of the photoreceptor is either negatively or positively charged such that when activating electromagnetic radiation strikes the photoconductive layer, charge is conducted through the photoconductor in that region to nuetralize or reduce the surface potential in the illuminated region
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Other layers, including surface release layers and interlayers, such as priming layers, charge injection blocking layers, barrier layers may also be used in some photoreceptive elements.
      <br/>
      These photoreceptors are typically multilayer constructions comprised of an underlying photoconductive layer sensitive to actinic radiation and various top coats which impart barrier and/or release properties to the photoreceptor.
      <br/>
      See R. M. Schaffert, "Electrophotography" (John Wiley: N.Y., 1975), pp. 260-396.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      When multi-colored images are desired, one may apply each toner color to the photoconductor element and transfer each color image to the final substrate separately.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, all the colors may be first assembled in registration on the photoconductor element and then transferred to a final receptor, either directly or via an intermediate transfer element.
      <br/>
      This method is referred to herein as simplified color electrophotography (SCE).
      <br/>
      See e.g. WO97/12288, (incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      Specifically, a photoreceptor is movably positioned to pass at least one exposure station and at least one developing station.
      <br/>
      If there is only one exposure station or one developing station, the photoreceptor will have to move past the stations several times to create a multicolor image on the photoreceptor, e.g. two or more rotations.
      <br/>
      If there are several exposure and developing stations the image may be created in a single pass of the photoreceptor.
      <br/>
      To begin creating a multi-color image, any previously accumulated charge is erased from the photoreceptor.
      <br/>
      The photoreceptor is charged to a predetermined charge level.
      <br/>
      The photoreceptor is first image-wise exposed to radiation modulated in accordance with the image data for one of a plurality of colors in order to partially discharge the photoreceptor to produce an image-wise distribution of charges on the photoreceptor corresponding to the image data for the one of the plurality of colors.
      <br/>
      A first color liquid toner is applied to the image-wise distribution of charges on the photoreceptor to form a first color image.
      <br/>
      The photoreceptor may then optionally be recharged by any known means, e.g. by corona charging, or the application of the first toner liquid may itself recharge the photoreceptor to a second predetermined charge level.

      A problem that may arise during electrophotographic imaging is poor transfer from the photoreceptor to the intermediate transfer member.
      <br/>
      Poor transfer may be manifested by images that are light, speckled, fuzzy, or smeared.
      <br/>
      These transfer problems may be reduced by the use of a surface release coating on the photoreceptor.

      The release layer should also resist chemical attack or excessive swelling by the toner carrier fluid.
      <br/>
      The release layer should also not significantly interfere with the charge dissipation characteristics of the photoconductor construction.

      For liquid electrophotographic printing in particular, it may be desirable to avoid beading of toner excess carrier liquid on the surface of the release layer because the beads of carrier liquid can disturb the toner image.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the presence of the toner carrier liquid on the surface may allow the toned image to continue to flow with adverse effects on image resolution.
      <br/>
      Moreover, when a multi-color image is formed on the photoreceptor in a single pass without drying between imaging stages, such beading may cause diffraction of the exposing light during imaging resulting in lack of sharp lines or clarity in the final image.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Therefore, release layers which control the liquid on the surface of the photoreceptor are needed.
      <br/>
      However, the liquid toner should not cause smearing or diffusional broadening (i.e., blooming) of the image.
      <br/>
      Desirably, the surface release layers permit virtually 100% image transfer from the photoreceptor to an intermediate transfer member, thereby maintaining optimum image quality eliminating or reducing the need to clean the photoreceptor between images.

      Color liquid electrophotography, particularly SCE, imposes a number of critical requirements on the release surface of the photoreceptor.
      <br/>
      The photoreceptor release surface must, in general, provide a low energy surface for transfer of the toner.
      <br/>
      Moreover, systems that rely on differential adhesive transfer rely on the relationship of the surface energies of the photoreceptor surface, the liquid toner, the toner film, and any rollers that contact the toner surface.

    <p num="20">2) Electrostatic Imaging</p>
    <p num="21">
      While the foregoing discussion has focused on the problems associated with surface release layers on photoreceptors in liquid electrophotographic imaging, additional deficiencies with temporary imaging receptors used in other liquid toner imaging processes, particularly liquid electrostatic printing, are known to exist.
      <br/>
      In electrostatic printing, an electrostatic image is formed by (1) placing a charge onto the surface of a dielectric element (either a temporary image receptor or the final receiving substrate) in selected areas of the element with an electrostatic writing stylus or its equivalent to form a charged image, (2) applying toner to the charged image, (3) drying or fixing the toned image on the dielectric, and optionally (4) transferring the fixed toned image from the temporary image receptor to a permanent receptor.
      <br/>
      The surface release layer can be transferred with the fixed toned image to the final receptor or can remain on the temporary image receptor after the image transfer to the final receptor.
      <br/>
      An example of a liquid electrostatic imaging process which makes use of all four steps is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,259. Suitable surface release layers useful in such electrostatic imaging processes are described in European Patent Application 444,870 A2 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,045,391 and 5,264,291.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The surface of the dielectric element is typically chosen to be a release layer such as silicone, fluorosilicone or fluorosilicone copolymer.
      <br/>
      The release layer should be durable and resistant to abrasion.
      <br/>
      The release layer should also resist chemical attack or excessive swelling by the toner carrier fluid.
      <br/>
      The release layer should also not significantly interfere with the charge dissipation characteristics of the dielectric construction.
      <br/>
      It will be understood by those skilled in the art that other properties could be important to durable release performance in liquid electrostatic printing other than those described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      One common problem that arises during electrostatic imaging is the phenomenon of carrier liquid beading on the temporary image receptor.
      <br/>
      Since electrostatic imaging processes typically make use of non-optical means (e.g. an electrostatic stylus or an array of styli) to generate the latent electrostatic image on the surface release layer of the dielectric element, such carrier liquid beading does not generally cause problems of image degradation in multicolor imaging processes due to diffraction of an exposing radiation source as may occur in liquid electropilotographic imaging.
      <br/>
      However, carrier liquid beading can still degrade image quality by causing the wet toned image to diffusionally broaden or flow, with adverse effects on image resolution.
      <br/>
      Such image degradation is commonly referred to in tile art as "bleeding" of the image.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Another problem which arises in multicolor liquid electrostatic imaging relates to removal of a portion of one color toner layer during the application of a second color toner layer due to contact of the first, still wet toner layer with the electrostatic styli.
      <br/>
      This phenomenon is commonly referred to in the art as "head scraping."
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Yet another problem which arises in multicolor liquid electrostatic printing processes, particularly as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,259, relates to the final transfer step of the fixed toned image from the temporary image receptor to a permanent receptor.
      <br/>
      This transfer process is commonly carried out using heat and/or pressure.
      <br/>
      This transfer process is inherently slow, and its speed is limited by the rate at which heat can be transferred through the temporary image receptor and by the upper limit of pressure which can be applied during the transfer step.
      <br/>
      If the applied heat and/or pressure are not correctly selected, or the transfer speed is too high, poor image transfer can result.
      <br/>
      Poor image transfer may be manifested by incompletely transferred images or images that are light and/or speckled.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Therefore, there is a need for release layers which control the liquid on the surface of the dielectric receptor and minimize the beading effect.
      <br/>
      There is also a need for surface release layers which permit virtually 100% image transfer from the temporary image receptor (e.g. dielectric element) to a permanent receptor.
      <br/>
      There is also a need for surface release layers which permit image transfer from the temporary image receptor to the permanent receptor at higher transfer speeds and at lower temperatures and/or pressures.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="29">
      This invention discloses novel surface release layers and the use of such surface release layers as temporary image receptors suitable for use in liquid imaging processes.
      <br/>
      The temporary receptors are particularly suited to liquid electrographic printing (electrostatic, electrophotographic and ionographic).
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      One aspect of this invention is to provide the solvent resistance, swelling resistance, abrasion resistance and durability of photoreceptor release layers.
      <br/>
      Another aspect of this invention is to improve the imaging performance of the surface release layers.
      <br/>
      Still another feature of the present invention is the ability to improve imaging performance by decreasing the coefficient of friction of the surface release layer.
      <br/>
      Still another feature of the present invention is the ability to enhance image transfer performance.
      <br/>
      An advantage of the present invention is that virtually any surface release material presently used in the art can be improved by inclusion of the chemical release modifiers: namely, highly branched and/or tightly crosslinked components such as silicate resins condensation products of silane coupling agents, additives that modify the coefficient of friction, silicone gums, and fillers, as used in the present invention with temporary image receptors in electrography.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Another advantage of the present invention is the ability to use the compositions of the present invention on virtually any known photoconductor substrate or dielectric substrate known in the art, either in a reusable or disposable fashion and either in a transfer or retention mode.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the present invention is the ability to combine the compositions of the present invention with other techniques for improving release properties, such as a physical modification of the surface release layer as disclosed in copending, coassigned U.S. patent application Ser.

    <p num="32">
      According to one embodiment, this invention is a photoreceptor comprising an electroconductive substrate, a photoconductive layer on the electroconductive substrate, and a surface release layer over the photoconductive layer.
      <br/>
      The surface release layer is multimodal. "Multimodal" as used herein means that the polymeric material comprising the release layer has three or more predominant ranges of chain lengths between crosslinks. "Chain length between crosslinks" indicates how many monomeric units are in the backbone of the polymer between monomeric units from which branching or cross-linking has occurred.
      <br/>
      For example, for a trimodal system there are three predominant ranges of chain lengths between crosslinks.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The release layer preferably comprises the reaction product of a relatively high functional silicone oligomer, a relatively low functional silicone oligomer, an optional cross-linking agent, and a highly branched component, such as silicate resin The silicate resin improves durability and image performance.
      <br/>
      These resins also modify the peel force of the release compositions, which serves to improve liquid imaging performance.
    </p>
    <p num="34">In another embodiment of the invention concerning liquid electrostatic imaging, the temporary receptor is comprised of the release layer coated onto a dielectric substrate such as paper, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,045,391 and 5,262,259, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p num="35">
      Yet another embodiment of the invention is the use of low viscosity release formulations for solventless coating onto a photo photoreceptive element or electrostatic element.

      According to this embodiment, the invention is a method for making a temporary image receptor comprising the steps of:
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      providing a substrate;
      <br/>
      providing a silicon or fluorine containing prepolymer having a number average molecular weight from 500-30,000 Da; a crosslinking agent; and, optionally, a silicon or fluorine containing polymer having a molecular weight in the range from 30,000 to 500,000 Da, to form a solventless release coating composition;
      <br/>
      coating the solventless release coating composition onto the substrate; and
      <br/>
      curing the solventless release coating composition.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Molecular weight as used herein refers to number average molecular weight unless explicitly stated to the contrary.</p>
    <p num="38">Still another embodiment of the invention is the use of chemical modifiers in combination with low surface energy fillers in silicone release surfaces as a means to improve the durability and imaging performance of a temporary image receptor.</p>
    <p num="39">
      For electrostatic imaging substrates, the release layer can either transfer with the image to the final receptor or remain with the temporary image receptor for additional use or disposal.
      <br/>
      The function of the release layer in a transfer to the final receptor can become a protective layer, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat.

    <p num="41">Substrates</p>
    <p num="42">
      This invention comprises a temporary image receptor comprised of at least a surface release layer and a substrate.
      <br/>
      Any conventional substrate is a suitable candidate for use in the present invention with the surface release layer.
      <br/>
      Nonlimiting examples of substrates include a metal drum, metal-coated web, belt, sheet, paper, or other material found useful in liquid printing processes.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Electrophotogranhic Printing Substrates</p>
    <p num="44">
      The photoreceptors of this invention comprise an electroconductive substrate, a photoconductive layer, optional interlayers, such as barrier layers, priming layers, and charge blocking layers, and a release layer.
      <br/>
      The photoreceptor may be of any known structure but is preferably a belt or a drum.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Electroconductive substrates for photoconductive systems are well known in the art and are generally of two general classes: (a) self-supporting layers or blocks of conducting metals, or other highly conducting materials; (b) insulating materials such as polymer sheets, glass, or paper, to which a thin conductive coating, e.g. vapor coated aluminum, has been applied.</p>
    <p num="46">
      The photoconductive layer can be any type known in the art, including (a) an inorganic photoconductor material in particulate form dispersed in a binder or, more preferably, (b) an organic photoconductor material.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the photoconductor is dependent on the material used, but is typically in the range of 5 to 150  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Photoconductor elements having organic photoconductor material are discussed in Borsenberger and Weiss, "Photoreceptors: Organic Photoconductors", Ch. 9 Handbook of Imaging Materials, ed, Arthur S. Diamond, Marcel Dekker, Inc. 1991. When an organic photoconductor material is used, the photoconductive layer can be a bilayer construction consisting of a charge generating layer and a charge transport layer.
      <br/>
      The charge generating layer is typically about 0.01 to 20  MU m thick and includes a material, such as a dyestuff or pigment, which is capable of absorbing light to generate charge carriers.
      <br/>
      The charge transport layer is typically 10-20  MU m thick and includes a material, such as poly-N-vinylcarbazoles or derivatives of bis(benzocarbazole)-phenylmethane in a suitable binder.
      <br/>
      The material must be capable of transferring the generated charge carriers.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In standard use of bilayer organic photoconductor materials in photoconductor elements, the charge generation layer is located between the conductive substrate and the charge transport layer.
      <br/>
      Such a photoconductor element is usually formed by coating the conductive substrate with a thin coating of a charge generation layer, overcoated by a relatively thick coating of a charge transport layer.
      <br/>
      During operation, the surface of the photoconductor element is negatively charged.
      <br/>
      Upon imaging, in the light-struck areas, hole/electron pairs are formed at or near the charge generation layer/charge transport layer interface.
      <br/>
      Electrons migrate through the charge generation layer to the conductive substrate while holes migrate through the charge transport layer to neutralize the negative charge on the surface.
      <br/>
      In this way, charge is neutralized in the light-struck areas.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Alternatively, an inverted bilayer system may be used.
      <br/>
      Photoconductor elements having an inverted bilayer organic photoconductor material require positive charging which results in less deterioration of the photoreceptor surface.
      <br/>
      In a typical inverted bilayer system, the conductive substrate is coated with a relatively thick coating (about 5 to 20  MU m) of a charge transport layer, overcoated with a relatively thin (0.05 to 1.0  MU m) coating of a charge generation layer.
      <br/>
      During operation, the surface of the photoreceptor is typically positively charged.
      <br/>
      Upon imaging, in the light-stick areas, hole/electron pairs are formed at or near the charge generation layer/charge transport layer interface.
      <br/>
      Electrons migrate through the charge generation layer to neutralize the positive charge on the surface while holes migrate through the charge transport layer to the conductive substrate.
      <br/>
      In this way, charge is again neutralized in the light-struck areas.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      As yet another alternative, all organic photoconductive layer can comprise a single-layer construction containing a mixture of charge generation and charge transport materials and having both charge generating and charge transport capabilities.
      <br/>
      Examples of single-layer organic photoconductive layers are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,087,540 and 3,816,118, incorporated by reference herein.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Suitable charge generating materials for use in a single layer photoreceptor and/or the charge generating layer of a dual layer photoreceptor include azo pigments, perylene pigments, phthalocyanine pigments, squaraine pigments, and two phase aggregate materials.
      <br/>
      The two phase aggregate materials contain a light sensitive filamentary crystalline phase dispersed in an amorphous matrix.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The charge transport material transports the charge (holes or electrons) from the site of generation through the bulk of the film.
      <br/>
      Charge transport materials are typically either molecularly doped polymers or active transport polymers.
      <br/>
      Suitable charge transport materials include enanmines, hydrazones, oxadiazoles, oxazoles, pyrazolines, triaryl amnines, and triaryl methanes.
      <br/>
      A suitable active transport polymer is polyvinyl carbazole.
      <br/>
      Especially preferred transport materials are polymers such as poly(N-vinyl carbazole) and acceptor doped poly(N-vinylcarbazole).

    <p num="55">
      The photoconductor element of this invention may further comprise an interlayer between the photoconductor layer and the release layer.
      <br/>
      The interlayer or interlayers can serve a variety of purposes such as improving the adhesion of the release layer to the photoconductor layer, protecting the photoconductor layer from the toner carrier liquid and other compounds which might damage the photoconductor, and protecting the photoconductive layer from damage that could occur from charging the photoconductor element with a voltage corona.
      <br/>
      Examples of such interlayers include charge blocking layers, primer layers, and barrier layers.
      <br/>
      The interlayer, like the release layer, must not significantly interfere with the charge dissipation characteristics of the photoconductor element and must adhere well to the photoconductive layer and the release layer, preferably without tile need for adhesives.

    <p num="96">
      The temporary image receptors of the present invention may be utilized in a variety of operational imaging processes, including but not limited to liquid electrophotographic printing and liquid electrostatic printing.
      <br/>
      A requirement of these operational processes is that the the liquid toner image reside only temporarily on the image receptor, and that a subsequent transfer step is used to transfer the image to a final, permanent receptor.
      <br/>
      In accordance with these requirements, we envision a number of operational modes for the chemically modified release surface.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      According to one preferred operation of electrophotography, the operation comprises the steps of:
      <br/>
      producing an image-wise distribution of charges on a photoreceptor corresponding to the image data;
      <br/>
      applying a liquid toner comprising solid charged pigmented toner particles in a carrier liquid to the photoreceptor forming an image-wise distribution of the toner particles on said photoreceptor to form the image;
      <br/>
      transferring the image from the photoreceptor to an intermediate transfer element forming a first transfer nip under pressure with the photoreceptor;
      <br/>
      transferring the image from the intermediate transfer element to a receptor media.
      <br/>
      If an image of more than color is being formed, preferably all the colors are assembled on the photoreceptor in registration prior to transfer to the intermediate transfer element.
      <br/>
      The assembly of the colors may be done in a single pass or by multiple passes of the photoreceptor.
      <br/>
      The release layers of this invention have been found to work well with the intermediate transfer element of copending U.S. Application U.S. Pat. No. 5,965,3140, incorporated herein by reference, as well as with the system disclosed in that application wherein no image drying station is used.
      <br/>
      Of course, a drying means may be used if desired.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      For example, the release surface may be substantially adhered to or fixed to the underlying substrate of the temporary image receptor.
      <br/>
      In such case we refer to a reusable surface release layer, that is, a surface release layer which remains with the temporary image receptor for additional use or disposal as contemplated above.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the surface release layer may be substantially non-adhered to the underlying substrate of the temporary image receptor.
      <br/>
      In such case we refer to a sacrificial surface release layer.
      <br/>
      The function of a sacrificial release layer in a transfer to the final receptor can become a protective layer, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat.

    <p num="99">Usefulness of the Invention</p>
    <p num="100">
      Chemical modification of release surfaces on temporary image receptors provides a means of modulating particular release characteristics (e.g. swelling resistance, carrier liquid beading, scratch resistance, durability, coefficient of friction and roughness) without significant modification of the release surface energy.
      <br/>
      The total surface energy of the chemically modified release shows less than a 10% change over the untreated release, and more importantly, the polar component of the release surface energy is maintained less than 5 dyne/cm.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      The solventless method of forming a release layer enables the release layer to be applied to virtually any substrate because there is no solvent to attack the underlying layers.
      <br/>
      In addition, the solventless method has the benefits of requiring fewer components, no solvent handling or disposal, and, therefore, potentially lower cost.

    <p num="102">
      Using the chemically modified release layers of the present invention, it is possible to optimize release performance for a particular imaging process without changing the base polymer characteristics.

    <p num="119">Coating Methods for Electrophotography</p>
    <p num="120">The experimental release layers were coated onto an inverted dual layer photoconductor and interlayer, the formulations of which have been described in Example 2 and Example 4, respectively, of U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,698, (both disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference), using extrusion die coating or gravure coating methods operated to achieve a desired coating thickness of 0.65-1.3 micrometers.</p>
    <p num="121">
      The solvent-based release compositions were extrusion die coated onto the barrier layer of a photoconductive web (0.102 mm in thickness) and dried in a 3.0 m air flotation dryer.
      <br/>
      The coating compositions were applied to give a final coating thickness of 0.5 to 1.0 micrometer and cured by exposing the web to 150 (degree)  C. for 1 minute at a web speed of 3.0 m/min.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      Many of the solventless release compositions were gravure coated onto the barrier layer of a photoconductive web (0.102 mm in thickness) and dried in a 3 meter air flotation dryer to give dry coating thicknesses in the range of the 0.65-1.5 micrometers.
      <br/>
      Gravure rolls with pyramidal cells having volume factors of between 3 and 10 cubic billion micrometers were used in a reverse gravure set-up to coat at roll speed ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2.5. Gravure roll speeds were 1 to 13.6 m/min and web speeds ranged from 2 to 50 m/min.
      <br/>
      The coating compositions were applied to give a final coating weight of 1.4 to 4 g/m2 and cured for 1 minute at 150 (degree)  C. using a 3.0 m/min web speed.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      Coating thickness was monitored on-line by including an appropriate amount of a UV fluorescent dye in a test formulation such that the signal measured on a UV gauge was proportional to the coating thickness in the region of interest.
      <br/>
      Gravure coatings were matte finish and showed gravure patterns under 50 *  magnification, compared to the glossy, smooth solvent based coatings.

    <p num="124">Coating Methods for Electrostatic Imaging</p>
    <p num="125">Release layers for electostatic imaging were coated onto a 3M Scotchlprint (tm)  Electronic Imaging Paper (8610) using extrusion die coating at 7% solids solution in heptane in the manner described in Table 2 to give release layer thicknesses ranging from 0.3-1.2 microns.</p>
    <p num="126">Test Methods</p>
    <p num="127">Coating thickness</p>
    <p num="128">
      Coating thicknesses were measured using an Edmunds Hi Mag (tm)  Comparator Gauge.
      <br/>
      The coated substrate to be measured was first placed under the measurement head and the unit was zeroed.
      <br/>
      The release coating was subsequently removed using a solvent which dissolves only the release layer.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the remaining substrate was then measured using the Edmunds Gauge, and the release layer thickness was determined as the difference between thickness readings of the two substrates.
    </p>
    <p num="129">Crosslinking density</p>
    <p num="130">
      The crosslinking density of experimental release coatings was measured using the solvent swelling method as disclosed in O. L. Flaningam and N. R. Langley in The Analytical Chemistry of Silicones, E. Lee Smith (ed) (John Wiley and Sons: New York, 1991) p. 159. For solventless formulations, a 2 g sample of silicone formulation prepared according to Table 3 was weighed into a 2 inch (diameter) aluminum pan which had been sprayed with 3M (tm)  Scotchgard (tm)  (Cat. No. 4101).
      <br/>
      The sample was cured at 150 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes in an oven and allowed to sit overnight before testing.
      <br/>
      Samples were also UV cured, as described above.
      <br/>
      The crosslinking density of solvent base formulations was measured by placing approximately 3 g of a solution of Stock A and B (see Table 2) into a teflon coated aluminum pan.
      <br/>
      The solvent was allowed to evaporate overnight in a vented hood before the sample was heated at 150 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      The cured sample was allowed to sit overnight before being taken out of the aluminum pan and carefully weighed.
      <br/>
      It was then submerged in toner carrier liquid (Norpar 12, Exxon Corporation) in a closed glass container overnight, and then reweighed.
      <br/>
      The percent swelling was expressed as the percent difference in weight of the solvent swollen material relative to the unswollen (initial) material.
    </p>
    <p num="132">Scratch Test for Durability</p>
    <p num="133">
      Durability of the release coating was measured using a Scrape Adhesion Tester, available from BYK Gardner USA (Columbia, Md.), as described in ASTM test method D2197.
      <br/>
      The instrument consists of a pivoted beam with a 45 degree stylus holder, weight post, and holder for supporting the total test load.
      <br/>
      On one end of the beam is mounted the stylus; on the other end of the beam is a counterweight.
      <br/>
      A claim is rotated to lower and raise the stylus.
      <br/>
      A sample bed mounted on ball bearings is used to move the test panel against the stationary stylus in a direction parallel to the beam.
      <br/>
      The stylus used in this test was a 1.6 mm chrome plated drill rod, bent to a 180 degree loop with a 6.5 mm OD. By moving a free edge of the test film against this loop under variable load (expressed in grams), the durability of the coating was expressed as the minimum load (g) required to create a continuous scratch in the coating.
      <br/>
      More durable coatings required higher load values to mar the surface.
    </p>
    <p num="134">Coefficient of Friction</p>
    <p num="135">
      The coefficient of friction was measured according to ASTM method D1894-63, sub-procedure A using a Slip/Peel Tester Model SP-102B-3M90 made by Instruments, Inc. and available from IMASS, Inc.(Hingham, Mass.).
      <br/>
      A strip of release coated photoreceptor (approximately 6 cm wide) was mounted on a movable platen and an uncovered friction sled, its foam surface in contact with the coating layer, was drawn across the coating at a rate of 15 cm/min for 25 seconds.
      <br/>
      The coefficient of friction was calculated as the ratio of the tractive (pulling) force to the normal (sled weight) force.
    </p>
    <p num="136">Peel force</p>
    <p num="137">
      Slip/peel tester model SP-102B-3M90 from Instruments, Inc. (Strongsville, Ohio) was used for tape peel force measurements.
      <br/>
      A 3.2 cm * 10 cm sample strip was affixed to the working platen with double stick tape.
      <br/>
      A 2.5 cm wide strip of 3M (tm)  202 masking tape was applied to the sample release surface and a 6.8 kg roller was rolled over the tape 6 times.
      <br/>
      Immediately after adhering the tape, a MB-10 load cell was used to measure the average force (g/cm) required to peel the tape off the surface at 180 degrees and 2.3 m/min for 2 seconds.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      In order to predict the change in peel force over extended printing, the Durability Wiper Test was used to abrade samples of the release as described in PCT Patent Publication WO96/34318.
      <br/>
      The peel force was measured on fresh samples (0 wipes) and wiped samples (2400 and 3600 wipes over a 360 degree are as described in Durability Wiper Test, below).
    </p>
    <p num="139">Durability Wiper Test</p>
    <p num="140">
      A durability wiper test was used to evaluate release surface durability and abrasion resistance in simulated wet cycling using pure toner carrier liquid in place of liquid toner.
      <br/>
      The toner carrier liquid was selected to be NORPAR 12 (Exxon Corp.).
      <br/>
      The durability wiper consisted of a 16 cm diameter aluminum drum and 5 stainless steel shoes with concave surfaces having radii to match the drum.
      <br/>
      The drum was positioned horizontally and attached to a gear and motor which enabled rotation of the drum at a speed of 40 rev/min.
      <br/>
      The 5 stainless steel shoes rested, by their own weight (about 300 g) concave side down, on the top side curve of the drum.
      <br/>
      The shoes were held in place so that they did not move with the rotation of the drum, but could move vertically.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      Two layers of paper toweling were wrapped around the drum and then soaked in toner carrier liquid.
      <br/>
      One 3.2 cm * 10 cm strip of the photoconducter construction was secured onto the curved surface of each metal shoe so that, when the shoes were in place, the release surface was in contact with the paper toweling.
      <br/>
      The drum was then rotated at 40 rev/min for 800 revolutions.
      <br/>
      For samples with more than 800 wiping revolutions, the paper toweling was replaced by fresh NORPAR 12 soaked toweling every 800 revolutions.
      <br/>
      After wiping, the sample strips were air dried at least overnight before peel tests were carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="142">Surface Energy (Dynamic Contact Angle)</p>
    <p num="143">
      Dynamic contact angles were measured using the Wilhelmy plate method as disclosed in D. J. Shaw, Introduction to Colloid and Surface Science, (Butterworths: London, 1992), p 72 on a Kruss (Charlotte, N.C.) K12 process tensiometer controlled by the K121 software package.
      <br/>
      Samples were prepared by laminating two sheets of release coated photoreceptor with a 3M (tm)  glue stick such that the silicone coating was exposed on each side and no gaps were formed.
      <br/>
      A punch was then used to precisely cut square samples of dimensions 18.2 mm wide * 0.22 mm thick.
      <br/>
      Each sample was measured using a caliper prior to immersion and the appropriate measurements were entered into the wetted length (actually wetted perimeter) calculation.
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      In order to calculate tile surface energy of a given experimental release surface, the dynamic contact angles of two probe fluids (NORPAR 12 and water) were measured with respect to the sample.
      <br/>
      The geometric mean method of Owens and Wendt (D. K. Owens and R. C. Wendt, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 13, pp. 1741-7 (1969)), was then used to calculate the total solid surface energy as well as the polar and dispersion components of this surface energy using Kruss K121 software.
      <br/>
      The Owens and Wendt method requires measurements of dynamic contact angles using two probe fluids of known surface tension and known polar and dispersion components of the surface tension.
      <br/>
      At least one of the probe fluids must have a nonzero polar component of the surface tension; this requirement is met by using water as one of the probe fluids.
      <br/>
      In addition we selected NORPAR 12 carrier liquid as a probe fluid because it is the preferred carrier for liquid toners used in simplified color electrophotography.
      <br/>
      NORPAR 12, is a blend of nonpolar C10 -C14 aliphatic hydrocarbons, and thus provides a probe fluid which exhibits only a dispersion component of surface tension.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      Dynamic advancing contact angles were measured using a 4.00 mm/minute search rate and a 3.00 mm/minute measuring rate.
      <br/>
      The electrobalance sensitivity was 0.005 g. The immersion depth was 3.00 mm with a wait time of 5.0 seconds at the turning point.
      <br/>
      Two cycles were run on each of two release samples for each probe fluid.
      <br/>
      The surface energy for the group was therefore based on 4 release coated substrate samples and 8 determinations of dynamic advancing contact angle using two probe fluids.
      <br/>
      The surface tension values of Strom (measured at 20 C) were used for each test fluid and verified experimentally for each reagent lot using a perfectly wetting platinum Whilhelmy plate to measure liquid surface tension.
    </p>
    <p num="146">Surface Roughness Measurements</p>
    <p num="147">
      Several methods were used to characterize the surface roughness, including interferometry.
      <br/>
      The data reported here were derived from the WYKO RST-PLUS in VSI mode (WYKO Corporation, Tucson, Ariz.) interferometer at a magnification of 41.4 * .
    </p>
    <p num="148">Print Quality Evaluation for Electrophotographic Printing</p>
    <p num="149">
      Print quality was evaluated for each formulation using a 4-pass color printing mechanism described in WO97/12288.
      <br/>
      The printer was configured with a transfer roll and a drying roll as described in co-pending U.S. application U.S. Pat. No. 5,965,314 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,869, respectively.
      <br/>
      A section of the release coated organic photoreceptor web was adhered to the drum and a dry electrostatic test was run to evaluate the charging and discharging characteristics of the unprinted photoconducter.
      <br/>
      Monochrome black toner as described in Example 40 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,652,282, (incorporated by reference herein) was then used to develop and transfer images from the photoconductor to consecutive paper sheets.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      One print was first made on the printing apparatus with the drying mechanism disengaged to allow for visual inspection of the dewetting (i.e. beading) of the toner carrier fluid on the photoconductor release surface.
      <br/>
      Toner carrier liquid beading is generally undesirable in multicolor liquid electrophotographic imaging processes since it may result in fluid "lenses" on the photoconducter surface which may interfere with subsequent latent image generation steps that make use of actinic radiation to discharge the photoconducter in areas to be imaged.
      <br/>
      The printing process was completed with the non-dried, film formed image being transferred from the photoconducter to paper via the intermediate transfer roll.
      <br/>
      Failure to transfer 100% of the image to the intermediate transfer roll was designated T1 transfer failure.
      <br/>
      This T1 transfer failure was graded by observing the amount of toner that could be transferred off of the photoconductor to a clean sheet of paper (i.e., the clean up sheet), This process was repeated with a drying roll engaged to evaluate T1 failure in that printing configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      To evaluate the release in multiple use applications, a series was run consisting of ten consecutive prints followed by one clean up sheet.
      <br/>
      This was repeated for each printer configuration.
      <br/>
      A final electrostatic test was performed after the last clean up sheet.
      <br/>
      The offset of small sections of dried toner image from the photoconducter to the drying roll (i.e. drying roll picking) was also graded by cleaning the regeneration rolls and inspecting for residual toner.
      <br/>
      The liquid toner in the developer unit was changed after every three release material evaluations.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      All of the release materials were ranked based on print quality of the tenth print made both with and without the drying roll relative to each other and relative to the control sheets.
      <br/>
      A rating scale of 1 (very good performance) to 5 (very poor performance) was used to grade each of the following nine categories:
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      1.
      <br/>
      Beading (visible carrier liquid droplets on the surface of the photoconducter after squeegeeing),

      Fuzzy text (text characteristics which are indistinctly defined or which are surrounded by a lightly pigmented halo of toner),

      Fat text (text characters which exhibit broadening of the individual pixels),

      A 3M Scotchprint (tm)  Model 9510 Electrostatic Printer (as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,259) was modified to accommodate a 30 cm wide web, and used to print on release coated temporary image receptors.

      Images produced on the 3M Scotchprint (tm)  Modified Model 9510 Electrostatic Printer were examined for evidence of head scraping, resulting from toner delamination from the release surface and potentially leading to shorting between printing nibs.

      Transfer was graded by a visual standard method rating system (VSM).

      The VSM graded the effectiveness of image transfer by a visual inspection of the residual toner left on the transfer medium after transfer and by inspection of the receptor medium for transfer image quality, uniformity of color and presence of defects.
      <br/>
      Transfer was rated on a scale of 4.0-10.0, with 10.0 representing perfect transfer.
      <br/>
      A minimum rating of 8.5 was required for acceptable transfer.
      <br/>
      Transfer efficiency is a function of laminator speed, with 0.46 meters per minute used for standard product transfer.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of these tests, higher laminator speeds of 0.61 and 1.8 meters per minute were used.

      Image transfer performance was rated against a 3M Scotchprint (tm)  Electronic Image Transfer Media (8601) which was solvent coated with silicone urea release formulation, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,045,391.

      The Comparative Examples of surface release layers for electrophotographic printing are shown in Series 1 in Tables 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      A scaled up version of Formulation 1 in WO96/343 18 was extrusion (lie coated onto a photoreceptor construction of inverted dual layer photoconductor as described in Example 2 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,698, and interlayer in Example 4 of U.S. patent application No. 08/724,073 and cured to give a crosslinked silicone polymer.
      <br/>
      High molecular weight vinyl silicones were coated out of heptane to give a smooth and defect free release coating was obtained, as indicated by the small roughness factor (Ra equal to 3.26 nm) in Table 6 and the visibly glossy surface.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      The print quality of Comparative Example 1.1 was poor in a printer configuration without a drying roll, i.e., the print quality rating was greater than 2.
      <br/>
      Formulation 1.1, therefore, is only suited for a printing process with a drying roll.
      <br/>
      We also note that for an imaging process with a drying roll the print quality rating improves considerably when the beading of the liquid toner on the release is excluded from the analysis.
      <br/>
      However, since the drying roll is only applied after all four color planes are developed in a conventional SCE process, carrier liquid beading may be a problem in multicolor imaging on release surfaces such as those described in this comparative example.
      <br/>
      Any beading of the liquid toner prior to application of the drying roll may interfere with the generation of a laser scanned image (due to a lens effect).
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      Comparative Example 1.2 illustrates the use of another low swelling vinyl silicone used in combination with a high molecular weight gum.
      <br/>
      We note, however, that the print quality rating results in Comparative Example 1.2 are consistently poorer than those of Comparative Example 1.1.
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      In Comparative Example 1.3, we note that a 42% swelling silicone pre-polymer in combination with a high molecular weight silicone gum gives comparable print quality results to Comparative Example 1.2 without a drying roll.
      <br/>
      The print quality with a drying roll, however, is extremely poor, due to the offset of the toner image onto the drying roll.
    </p>
    <p num="165">As shown in Comparative Example 1.4, use of a high swelling (i.e. 99%) silicone gives improved print performance relative to moderately swelling silicone release formulation in Example 1.3 both with and without a dying roll and improved print performance relatively to the low swelling formulation of 1.2 without a drying roll.</p>
    <p num="166">
      Example 2 illustrates the use of a chemical additive to modify the coefficient of friction (C.O.F.) of a release surface.
      <br/>
      One additive that reduces the C.O.F. is a high molecular weight alkenyl functional gum.
      <br/>
      Examples 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 2.9, and 2.11 illustrate a homologous series of release formulations based on high swelling, hexenyl functional silicones.
      <br/>
      Examples 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 2.10, and 2.12 illustrate the addition of a high molecular weight, C.O.F. modifying silicone gum, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,468,815 and 5,520,978.
      <br/>
      These release surfaces have a more slippery feel, presumably due to the motion and flexibility of these long, unrestricted lengths of polydimethyl siloxane.
      <br/>
      The addition of gum lowers the C.O.F. without changing the peel force.
      <br/>
      The lower C.O.F. formulations give consistently improved printing performance both with and without the drying roll relative to the same formulation without the gum.
      <br/>
      Similar performance enhancements have been obtained with silicones of a higher crosslink density (i.e., lower swelling).
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      Example 3 illustrates the use of a silicate resin for improving the image transfer and print quality in an imaging process (i.e., with a drying roll) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,600,673; PCT Patent Publication No. WO96/34318; U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,698. Comparative Example 3.1 shows that the printing performance of the release surface without silicate resin is relatively poor both with and without a drying roll (unless beading is excluded from the analysis).
      <br/>
      The material set in Comparative Example 3.1 and Comparative Example 1.3 is identical except that the former was gravure coated from a 100% solids formulation.
      <br/>
      Both show very poor print quality with a drying roll due to image offset failure.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      In contrast, as shown in 1Examples 3.3 and 3.4, increasing the silicate resin concentration from 25% to 37.5% (i.e., 50% to 75% Dow Corning 7615) improved the print quality significantly with a drying roll relative to Comparative Examples 3.1, 3.2 and 1.3. The improvements in print quality are accompanied with an additional advantageous improvement in release surface durability.
      <br/>
      While not wishing to be bound by any particular mechanism, we believe that the improvement in durability is related to a more tightly crosslinked or multimodal structure resulting in reduced swelling, as shown in Table 6.
      <br/>
      The silicate resin acts as a peel force modifier; the addition of silicate resin increases both the initial peel force and the peel force after extended wear (3200 wipes).
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      While not wishing to be bound by any particular mechanism, we believe that the improvement in print quality in the printing process is due to the increase in peel force of the release layer to a value which is high enough to prevent toner offset to the drying roll, yet low enough to enable release of the image to the transfer roll.
      <br/>
      Incorporation of silicate resin does not adversely affect the surface energy of the release.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      We can distinguish the improvements in print quality and transfer due to silicate resin from the improvements caused by other chemical additives by the data in Table 6.
      <br/>
      The presence of silicate resin leads to a simultaneous increase in C.O.F., peel force and crosslinking density, while not changing the surface energy.
      <br/>
      This is distinguished from the mechanisms operative in Example 2 where the presence of a C.O.F. modifying additive decreases the C.O.F. while maintaining a constant, low peel force.
    </p>
    <p num="171">It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the improvements in print quality with silicate resin can be afforded by a variety of silicate resins and/or other resins that provide tightly crosslinked structures.</p>
    <p num="172">
      Example 4 illustrates the use of fillers in conjunction with other chemical release modifiers to generate a chemically-modified, roughened surface to enhance print quality both with and without a drying roll.
      <br/>
      As shown in Examples 4.1-4.6, the use of a small amount of hydrophobic fumed silica filler in a solvent coated release formulation increases the roughness of the coating without changing the surface energy; Ra values increase 20-100 times relative to an unfilled formulation.
      <br/>
      Roughening the release significantly improves the print quality both with and without a drying roll.
      <br/>
      Printing processes without drying roll are therefore enabled through the use of fillers.
      <br/>
      As shown in Example 4, the photoconducter release surface is critical to enabling a printing process without a drying roll.
      <br/>
      This result is consistent for release surfaces of varying crosslink density, as illustrated by Example 4.1-4.6 where % swelling ranges from 10-100%.
    </p>
    <p num="173">
      In addition to increasing roughness, the use of fumed silica in solvent coating results a concomitant decrease in C.O.F as shown in Examples 4.2, 4.4, and 4.6. While note wishing to be bound by any particular mechanism, the decrease in C.O.F. is due to the reduction of surface area available for contact, due to the elevation points of the filler.
      <br/>
      In contrast, when hydrophobic fumed silica is mixed into a solventless silicone as in Example 4.8, it disperses without agglomeration, therefore fewer contact points are seen, resulting in a visibly smoother surface, a lower Ra value and no reduction in C.O.F. Examples 2 and 4 therefore illustrate that the lowering the C.O.F. of the release surface consistently improves the print quality both with and without the drying roll.
      <br/>
      Reduction of C.O.F. may be accomplished either through the use of silicone gums or particulate fillers,
    </p>
    <p num="174">
      The combination of gravure coated release texture and filler illustrated in Example 4.7 and 4.8 provide for a preferred print quality without a drying roll.
      <br/>
      The use of textured surfaces is further described in co-pending application U.S. Ser. No. 08/833,111.
      <br/>
      We note that Example 4 further illustrates that chemical modifiers and patterning processes can be combined to give enhanced printing performance both with and without a drying roll.

      Comparative Example 5 is the Scotchprint (tm)  standard temporary image receptor (8601), which uses a solvent coated, silicone urea release formulation to give a smooth surface with no discernible pattern outside that imparted by the underlying substrate.
      <br/>
      Roughness of this standard release surface is 670  MU m. In contrast, the solvent coated alkenyl functional silicone formulations in Example 6 gave a somewhat elevated Ra value (800-1200  MU m), the highest increase of which was seen in the presence of 5 and 10% hydrophobic fumed silica (Examples 6.5 and 6.6, respectively).
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      As shown in Examples 6.1 to 6.7, significantly enhanced image transfer performance was found at 61 cm/min relative to the Comparative Example 5.
      <br/>
      Example 6.2 showed a lower transfer efficiency relative to Examples 6.1 and 6.3-6.7, reflecting the desirability of the C.O.F. modifying gum in the release formulations.
      <br/>
      Since standard product transfer is currently at 46 cm/min, this example demonstrates the potential of chemically modified release surfaces for improved transfer efficiency.
      <br/>
      No head scraping was observed under the conditions of the experiment.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, print quality was not degraded by the higher transfer rate.
      <br/>
      As shown by densitometry data in Table 9, the optical density of black, cyan, yellow and magenta toners were comparable to the control, with the exception of Example 6.3, which showed slightly lower density.

    <p num="179">As shown in Table 8, none of these solvent coated chemically modified release formulations were capable of achieving acceptable image transfer at an elevated speeds of 183 cm/min under the conditions used in this experiment.</p>
