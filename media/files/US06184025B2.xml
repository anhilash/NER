    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) the cause of which remains as yet unknown.</p>
    <p num="3">Many studies have supported the hypothesis of a viral etiology of the disease, but none of the known viruses tested has proved to be the causal agent sought: a review of the viruses sought for several years in MS has been compiled by E. Norrby (1) and R. T. Johnson (2).</p>
    <p num="4">
      Concomitantly, the possibility of an exogenous and/or infectious factor is suggested by the existence of localized epidemics or "clusters" of MS, as have been observed in the Faro Islands between 1943 and 1960 (3), in Sardinia (4), in Norway (5), and also by studies on migrant populations (6).
      <br/>
      Among all the exogenous factors suggested, viruses have been most often studied, and a viral etiology is traditionally called to mind.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The observation in MS of phenomena which can be likened to an autoimmunity reaction has led to an "essential" autoimmune etiological hypothesis (7 and 8).
      <br/>
      However, this autoimmunity directed against certain components of the CNS has been found not to be specific to MS and common in inflammation of the CNS, whether or not associated with an infection (9, 10, 11 and 12).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, none of the immunosuppressive therapies has enabled decisive results to be obtained against MS (13).
      <br/>
      It now seems likely that the "autoimmune" manifestations are induced by a mechanism of viral origin: cosensitization to viral determinants associated with molecules of cellular origin, phenomena of molecular mimicry (14), or by expression of retroviral superantigens (15).
    </p>
    <p num="6">Some studies have supported a hypothesis according to which a retrovirus is at the origin of the disease: the recent discovery (16) of neurological syndromes associated with the HTLV-I virus, originally known as an adult T-cell leukemia agent, has led many authors (17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23) to look for an involvement of this human retrovirus in MS, however without success or with results suggesting cross-reactions.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Recently, a retrovirus different from the known human retroviruses has been isolated in patients suffering from MS (24, 25 and 26).
      <br/>
      The authors were also able to show that this retrovirus could be transmitted in vitro, that patients suffering from MS produced antibodies capable of recognizing proteins associated with the infection of leptomeningeal cells by this retrovirus, and that the expression of the latter could be strongly stimulated by the immediate-early genes of some herpesviruses (27).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      All these results point to a role in MS of at least one unknown retrovirus or of a virus having reverse transcriptase activity which is detectable according to the method published by H. Perron (24) and qualified as "LM7-like RT" activity.
      <br/>
      The content of the publication identified by (24) is incorporated in the present description by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Recently, the Applicant's studies have enabled two continuous cell lines infected with natural isolates originating from two different patients suffering from MS to be obtained by a culture method as described in the document WO-A-9320188, the content of which is incorporated in the present description by reference.
      <br/>
      These two lines, derived from human choroid plexus cells, designated LM7PC and PLI-2, were deposited with the ECACC on Jul. 22, 1992 and Jan. 8, 1993, respectively, under numbers 92072201 and 93010817, in accordance with the provisions of the Budapest Treaty.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the viral isolates possessing LM7-like RT activity were also deposited with the ECACC under the overall designation of "strains".
      <br/>
      The "strain" or isolate harbored by the PLI-2 line, designated POL-2, was deposited on Jul. 22, 1992 under No. V92072202. The "strain" or isolate harbored by the LM7PC line, designated MS7PG, was deposited on Jan. 8, 1993 under No. V93010816.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Starting from the cultures and isolates mentioned above, characterized by biological and morphological criteria, the next step was to endeavour to characterize the nucleic acid material associated with the viral particles produced in these cultures.</p>

    <heading>DEFINITIONS</heading>
    <p num="13">
      Before describing the invention in detail, different terms used in the description and the claims are now defined:
      <br/>
      strain or isolate is understood to mean any infective and/or pathogenic biological fraction containing, for example, viruses and/or bacteria and/or parasites and generating pathogenic and/or antigenic activity, harbored by a culture or a living host; as an example, a viral strain according to the above definition can contain a coinfective agent, for example a pathogenic protist,
      <br/>
      the term "MSRV" used in the present description denotes any pathogenic and/or infective agent associated with multiple sclerosis, in particular a viral species, the attenuated strains of said viral species or the defective-interfering particles derived from this species.
      <br/>
      Viruses, and especially viruses containing RNA, are known to have a variability resulting, in particular, from relatively high rates of spontaneous mutation (28), which will be borne in mind below for defining the notion of equivalents,
      <br/>
      human viruses are understood to mean a virus capable of infecting human beings,
      <br/>
      in view of all the natural or induced variations which may be encountered when implementing the present invention, the subjects of the latter, defined above and in the claims, have been expressed including the equivalents or derivatives of the different biological materials defined below, in particular of the homologous nucleotide or peptide sequences,
      <br/>
      the variant of a virus or of a pathogenic and/or infective agent according to the invention comprises at least one antigen recognized by at least one antibody directed against at least one corresponding antigen of said virus and/or said pathogenic and/or infective agent, and/or a genome any part of which is detected by at least one hybridization probe and/or at least one nucleotide amplification primer specific for said virus and/or pathogenic and/or infective agent, such as, for example, the primers having a nucleotide sequence chosen from SEQ ID NO13 through SEQ ID NO38, dan their complementary sequences, under particular hybridization conditions well known to a person skilled in the art,
      <br/>
      according to the invention, a nucleotide fragment or an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide is an arrangement of monomers, or a biopolymers, characterized by the informational sequence of the natural nucleic acids, which are capable of hybridizing with any other nucleotide fragment under predetermined conditions, it being possible for the arrangement to contain monomers of different chemical structures and to be obtained from a molecule of natural nucleic acid and/or by genetic recombination and/or by chemical synthesis,
      <br/>
      thus, a monomer can be a natural nucleotide of nucleic acid whose constituent elements are a sugar, a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base; in RNA the sugar is ribose, in DNA the sugar is 2-deoxyribose; depending on whether the nucleic acid is DNA or RNA, the nitrogenous base is chosen from adenine, guanine, uracil, cytosine and thymine; or the nucleotide can be modified in at least one of the three constituent elements; as an example, the modification can occur in the bases, generating modified bases such as inosine, 5-methyldeoxycytidine, deoxyuridine, 5-(dimethylamino)deoxyuridine, 2,6-diaminopurine, 5-bromodeoxyuridine and any other modified base promoting hybridization; in the sugar, the modification can consist of the replacement of at least one deoxyribose by a polyamide (29), and in the phosphate group, the modification can consist of its replacement by esters chosen, in particular, from diphosphate, alkyl- and arylphosphonate and phosphorothioate esters,
      <br/>
      "informational sequence" is understood to mean any ordered succession of monomers whose chemical nature and order in a reference direction constitute or otherwise an item of functional information of the same quality as that of the natural nucleic acids,
      <br/>
      hybridization is understood to mean the process during which, under suitable working conditions, two nucleotide fragments having sequence pairs sufficiently complementary to form a complex structure, in particular double or triple, preferably in the form of a helix,
      <br/>
      a probe comprises a nucleotide fragment synthesized chemically or obtained by digestion or enzymatic cleavage of a longer nucleotide fragment, comprising at least six monomers, advantageously from 10 to 100 monomers and preferably 10 to 30 monomers, and possessing a specificity of hybridization under particular conditions; preferably, a probe possessing fewer than 10 monomers is not used alone, but used in the presence of other probes of equally short size or otherwise; under certain special conditions, it may be useful to use probes of size greater than 100 monomers; a probe may be used, in particular, for diagnostic purposes, such molecules being, for example, capture and/or detection probes,
      <br/>
      the capture probe may be immobilized on a solid support by any suitable means, that is to say directly or indirectly, for example by covalent bonding or passive adsorption,
      <br/>
      the detection probe may be labeled by means of a label chosen, in particular, from radioactive isotopes, enzymes chosen, in particular, from peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase and those capable of hydrolyzing a chromogenic, fluorogenic or luminescent substrate, chromophoric chemical compounds, chromogenic, fluorogenic or luminescent compounds, nucleotide base analogs and biotin,
      <br/>
      the probes used for diagnostic purposes of the invention may be employed in all known hybridization techniques, and in particular the techniques termed "DOT-BLOT" (30), "SOUTHERN BLOT" (31), "NORTHERN BLOT", which is a technique identical to the "SOUTHERN BLOT" technique but which uses RNA as target, and the SANDWICH technique (32); advantageously, the SANDWICH technique is used in the present invention, comprising a specific capture probe and/or a specific detection probe, on the understanding that the capture probe and the detection probe must possess an at least partially different nucleotide sequence,
      <br/>
      the invention also covers a probe capable of hybridizing in vivo or in vitro with RNA and/or with DNA in order to block the phenomena of replication, in particular translation and/or transcription, and/or to degrade said DNA and/or RNA,
      <br/>
      a primer is a probe comprising at least six monomers, and advantageously from 10 to 30 monomers, possessing a specificity of hybridization under particular conditions for the initiation of an enzymatic polymerization, for example in an amplification technique such as PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), in an elongation process such as sequencing, in a method of reverse transcription or the like,
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      two nucleotide or peptide sequences are termed equivalent or derived with respect to one another, or with respect to a reference sequence, if functionally the corresponding biopolymers can perform substantially the same role, without being identical, as regards the application or use in question, or in the technique in which they participate; two sequences are, in particular, equivalent if they are obtained as a result of natural variability, in particular spontaneous mutation of the species from which they have been identified, or induced variability, as are homologous sequences, homology being defined below,
      <br/>
      variability is understood to mean any spontaneous or induced modification of a sequence, in particular by substitution and/or insertion and/or deletion of nucleotides and/or of nucleotide fragments, and/or extension and/or shortening of the sequence at one or both ends; an unnatural variability can result from the genetic engineering techniques used, for example the choice of synthesis primers, degenerate or otherwise, selected for amplifying a nucleic acid; this variability can manifest itself in modifications of any starting sequence, considered as reference, and capable of being expressed by a degree of homology relative to said reference sequence,
      <br/>
      homology characterizes the degree of identity of two nucleotide or peptide fragments compared; it is measured by the percentage identity which is determined, in particular, by direct comparison of nucleotide or peptide sequences, relative to reference nucleotide or peptide sequences,
      <br/>
      this percentage identity has been specifically determined for the nucleotide fragments dealt with in the present invention which are homologous with the fragments identified by SEQ ID NO1 through NO9 (MSRV-1) on the one hand, and those which are homologous with the fragments identified by SEQ ID NO10 through NO12 (MSRV-2) on the other hand, as well as for the probes and primers homologous with the probes and primers identified by SEQ ID NO16 through NO26 and SEQ ID NO31 through NO33 on the one hand, and with the probes and primers identified by SEQ ID NO13 through NO15, SEQ ID NO27 through SEQ ID NO30 and SEQ ID NO34 through NO37 on the other hand; as an example, the smallest percentage identity observed between the different general consensus sequences of nucleic acids obtained from fragments of MSRV-1 viral RNA, originating from the LM7PC and PLI-2 lines according to a protocol detailed later, is 67% in the region described in FIG. 2,
      <br/>
      any nucleotide fragment is termed equivalent to or derived from a reference fragment if it possesses a nucleotide sequence equivalent to the reference sequence; according to the above definition, the following in particular are equivalent to a reference nucleotide fragment:
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      - a) any fragment capable of hybridizing at least partially with the complement of the reference fragment
      <br/>
      - b) any fragment whose alignment with the reference fragment results in the demonstration of a larger number of identical contiguous bases than with any other fragment originating from another taxonomic group
      <br/>
      - c) any fragment resulting, or capable of resulting, from the natural variability of the species from which it is obtained
      <br/>
      - d) any fragment capable of resulting from the genetic engineering techniques applied to the reference fragment
      <br/>
      - e) any fragment containing at least eight contiguous nucleotides encoding a peptide which is homologous with or identical to the peptide encoded by the reference fragment,
      <br/>
      - f) any fragment which is different from the reference fragment by insertion, deletion or substitution of at least one monomer, or extension or shortening at one or both of its ends; for example, any fragment corresponding to the reference fragment flanked at one or both of its ends by a nucleotide sequence not coding for a polypeptide,
      <br/>
      polypeptide is understood to mean, in particular, any peptide of at least two amino acids, in particular an oligopeptide or protein, extracted, separated or substantially isolated or synthesized through human intervention, in particular those obtained by chemical synthesis, or by expression in a recombinant organism,
      <br/>
      polypeptide partially encoded by a nucleotide fragment is understood to mean a polypeptide possessing at least 3 amino acids encoded by at least 9 contiguous monomers included in said nucleotide fragment,
      <br/>
      an amino acid is termed analogous to another amino acid when their respective physicochemical properties, such as polarity, hydrophobicity and/or basicity and/or acidity and/or neutrality are substantially the same; thus, a leucine is analogous to an isoleucine.
      <br/>
      any polypeptide is termed equivalent to or derived from a reference polypeptide if the polypeptides compared have substantially the same properties, and in particular the same antigenic, immunological, enzymological and/or molecular recognition properties; the following in particular are equivalent to a reference polypeptide:
      <br/>
      - a) any polypeptide possessing a sequence in which at least one amino acid has been replaced by an analogous amino acid,
      <br/>
      - b) any polypeptide having an equivalent peptide sequence, obtained by natural or induced variation of said reference polypeptide and/or of the nucleotide fragment coding for said polypeptide,
      <br/>
      - c) a mimotope of said reference polypeptide,
      <br/>
      - d) any polypeptide in whose sequence one or more amino acids of the L series are replaced by an amino acid of the D series, and vice versa,
      <br/>
      - e) any polypeptide into whose sequence a modification of the side chains of the amino acids has been introduced, such as, for example, an acetylation of the amine functions, a carboxylation of the thiol functions, an esterification of the carboxyl functions,
      <br/>
      - f) any polypeptide in whose sequence one or more peptide bonds have been modified, such as, for example, carba, retro, inverso, retro-inverso, reduced and methylenoxy bonds.
      <br/>
      - g) any polypeptide at least one antigen of which is recognized by an antibody of the reference polypeptide,
      <br/>
      the percentage identity characterizing the homology of two peptide fragments compared is, according to the present invention, at least 50% and preferably at least 70%.

    <p num="16">In view of the fact that a virus possessing reverse transcriptase enzymatic activity may be genetically characterized equally well in RNA and in DNA form, both the viral DNA and RNA will be referred to for characterizing the sequences relating to a virus possessing such reverse transcriptase activity (MSRV-1).</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="20">Example 1</p>
    <p num="21">Obtaining MSRV-2 Clones Designated MSRV-2A, by Amplification of the Conserved Regions of the Genes for RNA-Dependent DNA Polymerases on a Preparation of Infective Agent Purified from LM7 Line Cell Culture</p>
    <p num="22">
      The molecular approach consisted in using a PCR technique (33) which makes it possible to amplify a relatively conserved region of the pol gene of exogenous and endogenous retroviruses, but also of viruses coding for an enzyme having reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, such as, in particular, the hepatatis B virus, and, implicitly, of any gene for RNA-dependent DNA polymerase or for an enzyme, displaying sufficient sequence homologies in the regions defined by the amplification primers used.
      <br/>
      This PCR technique was used on the nucleic acids extracted from a purified preparation of infective agent, obtained according to the protocol (34) from supernatants of the original LM7 culture (24) which were kept frozen at -80 (degree)  C. since that time.
      <br/>
      The fractions containing the peak of LM7-like RT activity are taken up in one volume of a buffer containing guanidine thiocyanate (35), and are stored at -80 (degree)  C. until the nucleic acids are extracted according to the technique described by P. Chomzynski (35).
    </p>
    <p num="23">Prior to the PCR reaction, the RNA of the sample was transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) with so-called "random" primers (mixed hexanucleotides) using the "cDNA synthesis system plus" kit (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and on the basis of an approximate value, to the nearest log factor, of the amount of RNA present in the sample.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The DNA obtained after PCR amplification of the cDNA was inserted into a plasmid using the TA Cloning.RTM. kit (British Biotechnology).
      <br/>
      The 2  MU l of DNA solution were mixed with 5  MU l of sterile distilled water, 1  MU l of a 10-fold concentrated ligation buffer "10 * LIGATION BUFFER", 2  MU l of "pCR (tm)  VECTOR" (25 ng/ml) and 1  MU l of "TA DNA LIGASE".
      <br/>
      This mixture was incubated overnight at 12 (degree)  C. The following steps were carried out in accordance with the instructions of the TA Cloning.RTM. kit. At the end of the procedure, the white colonies of recombinant bacteria were picked out in order to be cultured and to permit extraction of the plasmids incorporated according to the so-called "miniprep" procedure (36).
      <br/>
      The plasmid preparation from each recombinant colony was cut with a suitable restriction enzyme and analyzed on agarose gel.
      <br/>
      Plasmids possessing an insert detected under UV light after staining the gel with ethidium bromide were selected for sequencing of the insert, after hybridization with a primer complementary to the Sp6 promoter present on the cloning plasmid of the "TA cloning kit".
      <br/>
      The reaction prior to sequencing was then performed according to the method recommended for the use of the sequencing kit "Prism ready reaction kit dye deoxyterminator cycle sequencing kit" (Applied Biosystems, ref. 401384), and automatic sequencing was carried out with an Applied Biosystems model 373 A "Automatic Sequencer" apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The sequences obtained were then analyzed using the Mac Vector.RTM. and Geneworks.RTM. software on Genebank.RTM. computerized data bank for the nucleic acid sequences, and Swiss Prot.RTM. for the amino acid sequences deduced from the reading frames revealed in the nucleic acid sequences.
      <br/>
      Analysis of the sequences obtained from the viral sample originating from the thawed LM7 supernatants, and which was purified at the peak of reverse transcriptase activity on a sucrose gradient, revealed a majority population of clones (approximately 42% of the clones), relative to the extent of individual representation of the other sequences (always less than 5%, or 10% in a small number of cases), displaying partial homologies with known retroviruses in the expected "pol" region.
      <br/>
      This clone is designated MSRV2-A and identified by SEQ ID NO10 (see FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The region amplified between the PCR primers is homologous with the corresponding sequence MSRV2-B identified by SEQ ID NO11 (see FIG. 5), described in Example 2.
      <br/>
      The differences observed in the sequences located at the PCR primers is explained by the use of degenerate primers in mixture form, used under different technical conditions.
      <br/>
      Interrogation of the Genebank.RTM. data bank, fully updated, did not enable an identical sequence or one displaying significant homologies to be revealed.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      This sequence is presented in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      It possesses an open reading frame in frame with the two PCR primers to be found at the ends, but it is shorter than the set of known retroviral sequences in the expected region between these primers.
      <br/>
      A deletion of 45 base pairs (15 amino acids) is observed therein following the sequence of the upstream primer, whereas the sequences preceding the downstream primer are present.
      <br/>
      However, the reading frame is open and uninterrupted over the whole of the sequence including the primers, and the deduced amino acid sequence displays a significant homology with the corresponding region of the known retroviruses.
      <br/>
      In the sequence lying inside the PCR primers, the amino acids Glu, Arg, Gln, Pro and Asp, normally fairly well conserved in this pol region of retroviruses and of known viruses with reverse transcriptase activity (33), are to be found conserved at the correct positions in the reading frame of the novel sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Lastly, in view of the fact that this sequence is sufficiently divergent from the retroviral sequences already described in the data banks, it may be suggested that the sequence in question belongs to a new infective and/or pathogenic agent, designated MSRV-2A.
      <br/>
      This agent is, in principle, on the basis of the analysis of the sequences obtained, related to a retrovirus but, in view of the technique used for obtaining this sequence, it may also be an RNA virus whose genome codes for an enzyme which incidentally possesses reverse transcriptase activity, as is the case, for example, with the hepatitis B virus, HBV (33).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the random nature of the degenerate primers used for this PCR amplification technique may very well have permitted, as a result of unforeseen sequence homologies or of conserved sites in the gene for a related enzyme, the amplification of a nucleic acid originating from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic pathogenic and/or coinfective agent (protist).

    <p num="30">
      A PCR technique derived from the technique published by Shih (33) was used.
      <br/>
      This technique enables all trace of contaminant DNA to be removed by treating all the components of the reaction medium with DNase.
      <br/>
      It concomitantly makes it possible, by the use of different but overlapping primers in two successive series of PCR amplification cycles, to increase the chances of amplifying a cDNA synthesized from an amount of RNA which is small at the outset and further reduced in the sample by the spurious action of the DNAse on the RNA.
      <br/>
      In effect, the DNase is used under conditions of activity in excess which enable all trace of contaminant DNA to be removed before inactivation of this enzyme remaining in the sample by heating to 85 (degree)  C. for 10 minutes, This variant of the PCR technique described by Shih (33) was used on a cDNa synthesized from the nucleic acids of fractions of infective particles purified on a sucrose gradient according to the technique described by H. Perron (34) from the "POL-2" isolate (ECACC No. V92072202) produced by the PLI-2 line (ECACC No. 92072201) on the one hand, and from the MS7PG isolate (ECACC No. V93010816) produced by the LM7PC line (ECACC No. 93010817) on the other hand.
      <br/>
      These cultures were obtained according to the methods which formed the subject of the patent applications published under Nos WO 93/20188 and WO 93/20189.

    <p num="31">After cloning the products amplified by this technique with the TA Cloning Kit.RTM. and analysis of the sequence using the automatic sequencer as has been described in Example 1, the sequences were analyzed using the Geneworks.RTM. software on the latest available version of the Genebank.RTM. data bank.</p>
    <p num="32">The sequences cloned and sequenced from these samples correspond, in particular, to two types of sequence: a first type of sequence, to be found in the majority of the clones (55% of the clones originating from the POL-2 isolates of the PLI-2 culture, and 67% of the clones originating from the MS7PG isolates of the LM7PC cultures), which corresponds to a family of "pol" sequences closely similar to, but different from, the endogenous human retrovirus designated ERV-9 or HSERV-9, and a second type of sequence which corresponds to sequences very strongly homologous with the sequence attributed to an infective and/or pathogenic agent previously designated MSRV-2.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The first type of sequence, representing the majority of the clones, consists of sequences whose variability enables four subfamilies of sequences to be defined.
      <br/>
      These subfamilies are sufficiently similar to one another for it to be possible to consider them to be quasi-species originating from the same retrovirus, as is well known for the HIV-1 retrovirus (37), or to be the outcome of interference with several endogenous proviruses coregulated in the producing cells.
      <br/>
      These more or less defective endogenous elements are sensitive to the same regulatory signals possibly generated by a replicative provirus, since they belong to the same family of endogenous retroviruses (38).
      <br/>
      This new family of endogenous retroviruses, or alternatively this new retroviral species from which the generation of quasi-species has been obtained in culture, and which contains a consensus of the sequences described below, is designated MSRV-1B.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 2 presents the general consensus sequences of the sequences of the different MSRV-1B clones sequenced in this experiment, these sequences being identified, respectively, by SEQ ID NO3, SEQ ID NO4, SEQ ID NO5 and SEQ ID NO6.
      <br/>
      These sequences display a homology with respect to nucleic acids ranging from 70% to 88% with the HSERV9 sequence referenced X57147 and M37638 in the Genebank.RTM. data base.
      <br/>
      The phylogenetic tree of these sequences is presented in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In this figure, the subfamilies A, B, C and D represent the sequences which have turned up preponderantly in similar experiments repeated subsequently, in the samples of pure RNA of virions purified from the MS7PG and POL-2 isolates.
      <br/>
      From these families of sequences, four "consensus" nucleic acid sequences representative of different quasi-species of a possibly exogenous retrovirus MSRV-1B, or of different subfamilies of an endogenous retrovirus MSRV-1B, have been defined.
      <br/>
      These representative consensus sequences are presented in FIG. 4, with the translation into amino acids.
      <br/>
      A functional reading frame exists for each subfamily of these MSRV-1B sequences, and it can be seen that the functional open reading frame corresponds in each instance to the amino acid sequence appearing on the second line under the nucleic acid sequence.
      <br/>
      The general consensus of the MSRV-1B sequence, identified by SEQ ID NO7 and obtained by this PCR technique in the "pol" region, is presented in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The second type of sequence representing the majority of the clones sequences is represented by the sequence MSRV-2B presented in FIG. 5 and identified by SEQ ID NO11.
      <br/>
      The region amplified between the PCR primers is homologous, apart from a single base, with the MSRV2-A sequence (SEQ ID NO10 according to FIG. 1) lying inside the PCR primers, described in Example 1.
      <br/>
      The differences observed in the sequences corresponding to the PCR primers are explained by the use of degenerate primers in mixture form used under different technical conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The sequences MSRV-2A (SEQ ID NO10) and MSRV-2B (SEQ ID NO11) are manifestly homologous, or even identical, derived from the same organism and sufficiently divergent from the retroviral sequences already described in the data banks for it to be suggested that the sequence region in question belongs to a new infective agent, designated MSRV-2.
      <br/>
      This infective agent would be, in principle, on the basis of the analysis of the first sequences obtained, related to a retrovirus but, in view of the technique used for obtaining this sequence, it could also be a DNA virus whose genome codes for an enzyme which incidentally possesses reverse transcriptase activity, as is the case, for example, with the hepatitis B virus, HBV (33).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the random nature of the degenerate primers used for this PCR amplification technique may very well have permitted, as a result of unforeseen sequence homologies or of conserved sites in the gene for a related enzyme, the amplification of a nucleic acid originating from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic pathogenic and/or coinfective agent (protist).

      The same PCR technique, modified according to the technique of Shih (33), was used to amplify and sequence the RNA nucleic acid material present in a purified fraction of virions at the peak of "LM7-like" reverse transcriptase activity on a sucrose gradient according to the technique described by H. Perron (34), and according to the protocols mentioned in Example 2, from a spontaneous lymphoblastoid line obtained by self-immortalization in culture of B lymphocytes from an MS patient who was seropositive for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), after setting up the blood lymphoid cells in culture in a suitable culture medium containing a suitable concentration of cyclosporin A. A representation of the reverse transcriptase activity in the sucrose fractions taken from a purification gradient of the virions produced by this line is presented in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the culture supernatants of a B line obtained under the same conditions from a control free from multiple sclerosis were treated under the same conditions, and the assay of reverse transcriptase activity in the sucrose gradient fractions proved negative throughout (background), and is presented in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Fraction 3 of the gradient corresponding to the MS B line and the same fraction without reverse transcriptase activity of the non-MS control gradient were analyzed by the same RT-PCR technique as before, derived from Shih (33), followed by the same steps of cloning and sequencing as described in Examples 1 and 2.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      It is particularly noteworthy that the MSRV-1 and MSRV-2 type sequences are to be found only in the material associated with a peak of "LM7-like" reverse transcriptase activity originating from the MS B lymphoblastoid line.
      <br/>
      These sequences were not to be found with the material from the control (non-MS) B lymphoblastoid line in 26 recombinant clones taken at random.
      <br/>
      Only Mo-MuLV type contaminant sequences, originating from the commercial reverse transcriptase used for the cDNA synthesis step, and sequences without any particular retroviral analogy were to be found in this control, as a result of the "consensus" amplification of homologous polymerase sequences which is produced by this PCR technique.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the absence of a concentrated target which competes for the amplification reaction in the control sample permits the amplification of dilute contaminants.
      <br/>
      The difference in results is manifestly highly significant (chi-squared, p&lt;0.001).

    <p num="43">
      This approach is directed towards obtaining reverse-transcribed DNA sequences from the supposedly retroviral RNA in the isolate using the reverse transcriptase activity present in this same isolate.
      <br/>
      This reverse transcriptase activity can theoretically function only in the presence of a retroviral RNA linked to a primer tRNA or hybridized with short strands of DNA already reverse-transcribed in the retroviral particles (39).
      <br/>
      Thus, the obtaining of specific retroviral sequences in a material contaminated with cellular nucleic acids was optimized according to these authors by means of the specific enzymatic amplification of the portions of viral RNAs with a viral reverse transcriptase activity.
      <br/>
      To this end, the authors determined the particular physicochemical conditions under which this enzymatic activity of reverse transcription on RNAs contained in virions could be effective in vitro.
      <br/>
      These conditions correspond to the technical description of the protocols presented below (endogenous RT reaction, purification, cloning and sequencing).
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The molecular approach consisted in using a preparation of concentrated but unpurified virion obtained from the culture supernatants of the PLI-2 line, prepared according to the following method: the culture supernatants are collected twice weekly, precentrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 minutes to remove cell debris and then frozen at -80 (degree)  C. or used as they are for the following steps.
      <br/>
      The fresh or thawed supernatants are centrifuged on a cushion of 30% glycerol-PBS at 100,000 g (or 30,000 rpm in a type 45 T LKB-HITACHI rotor) for 2 h at 4 (degree)  C. After removal of the supernatant, the sedimented pellet is taken up in a small volume of PBS and constitutes the fraction of concentrated but unpurified virion.
      <br/>
      This concentrated but unpurified viral sample was used to perform a so-called endogenous reverse transcription reaction as will now be described: a volume of 200  MU l of virion purified according to the protocol described above, and containing a reverse transcriptase activity of approximately 1-5 million dpm, is thawed at 37 (degree)  C. until a liquid phase appears, and then placed on ice.
      <br/>
      A 5-fold concentrated buffer was prepared with the following components: 500 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.2; 75 mM NaCl; 25 mM MgCl2 ; 75 mM DTT and 0.10% NP 40. 100  MU l of 5 * buffer+25  MU l of a 100 mM solution of dATP+25  MU l of a 100 mM solution of dTTP+25  MU l of a 100 mM solution of dGTP+25  MU l of a 100 mM solution of dCTP+100  MU l of sterile distilled water+200  MU l of the virion suspension (RT activity of 5 million DPM) in PBS were mixed and incubated at 42 (degree)  C. for 3 hours.
      <br/>
      After this incubation, the reaction mixture is added directly to a buffered phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol mixture (Sigma Ref. P 3803); the aqueous phase is collected and one volume of sterile distilled water is added to the organic phase to re-extract the residual nucleic acid material.
      <br/>
      The collected aqueous phases are combined, and the nucleic acids contained are precipitated by adding 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2 to 1/10 volume+2 volumes of ethanol+1  MU l of glycogen (Boehringer-Mannheim ref. 910 393) and placing the sample at -20 (degree)  C. for 4 h or overnight at +4 (degree)  C. The precipitate obtained after centrifugation is then washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 60 ml of distilled water.
      <br/>
      The products of this reaction were then purified, cloned and sequenced according to the protocol which will now be described: blunt-ended DNAs with unpaired adenines at the ends were generated: a "filling-in" reaction was first performed: 25  MU l of the previously purified DNA solution were mixed with 2  MU l of a 2.5 mM solution containing, in equimolar amounts, dATP+dGTP+dTTP+dCTP/1  MU l of T4 DNA polymerase (Boehringer-Mannheim ref. 1004 786)/5  MU l of 10 * "incubation buffer for restriction enzyme" (Boehringer-Mannheim ref. 1417 975)/1  MU l of a 1% bovine serum albumin solution/16  MU l of sterile distilled water.
      <br/>
      This mixture was incubated for 20 minutes at 11 (degree)  C. 50  MU l of TE buffer and 1  MU l of glycogen (Boehringer-Mannheim ref. 901 393) were added thereto before extraction of the nucleic acids with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (Sigma ref. P 3803) and precipitation with sodium acetate as described above.
      <br/>
      The DNA precipitated after centrifugation is resuspended in 10  MU l of 10 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5. 5  MU l of this suspension were then mixed with 20  MU l of 5 * Taq buffer, 20  MU l of 5 mM dATP, 1  MU l (5 U) of Taq DNA polymerase (Amplitaq (tm) ) and 54  MU l of sterile distilled water.
      <br/>
      This mixture is incubated for 2 h at 75 (degree)  C. with a film of oil on the surface of the solution.
      <br/>
      The DNA suspended in the aqueous solution drawn off under the film of oil after incubation is precipitated as described above and resuspended in 2  MU l of sterile distilled water.
      <br/>
      The DNA obtained was inserted into a plasmid using the TA cloning kit (tm) . The 2  MU l of DNA solution were mixed with 5  MU l of sterile distilled water, 1  MU l of a 10-fold concentrated ligation buffer "10 * LIGATION BUFFER", 2  MU l of "pCR (tm)  VECTOR" (25 ng/ml) and 1  MU l of "TA DNA LIGASE".
      <br/>
      This mixture was incubated overnight at 12 (degree)  C. The following steps were carried out according to the instructions of the TA Cloning.RTM. kit (British Biotechnology).
      <br/>
      At the end of the procedure, the white colonies of recombinant (white) bacteria were picked out in order to be cultured and to permit extraction of the plasmids incorporated according to the so-called "miniprep" procedure (36).
      <br/>
      The plasmid preparation from each recombinant colony was cut with a suitable restriction enzyme and analyzed on agarose gel.
      <br/>
      Plasmids possessing an insert detected under UV light after staining the gel with ethidium bromide were selected for sequencing of the insert, after hybridization with a primer complementary to the Sp6 promoter present on the cloning plasmid of the TA cloning kit.RTM.. The reaction prior to sequencing was then performed according to the method recommended for the use of the sequencing kit "Prism ready reaction kit dye deoxyterminator cycle sequencing kit" (Applied Biosystems, ref. 401384), and automatic sequencing was carried out with an Applied Biosystems "model 373 A Automatic Sequencer" apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions.

      The specific amplification primer oriented from 3' to 5' corresponds to the sequence identified by SEQ ID NO13:

    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The PCR performed at 35 (degree)  C. over 40 cycles with these primers enabled the genetic material specifically biotinylated by the first PCR step and captured on the Dynabeads.RTM. beads to be amplified.
      <br/>
      After cloning with the "TA cloning" kit of the DNA amplified by this second PCR step and sequencing of the recombinant clones, according to the techniques described in Example 1, a sequence of 748 base pairs was obtained.
      <br/>
      This nucleic acid sequence SEQ ID NO12 is presented in FIG. 12. This elongated sequence will be designated hereafter MSRV-2EL1.
    </p>
    <p num="72">The reverse sequence complementary to the primer SEQ ID NO13 is present at the 3' end and is boxed in FIG. 12. Upstream of this primer, the sequence already identified in the MSRV-2A and MSRV-2B clones is to be found.</p>
    <p num="73">The translation of this sequence into amino acids according to the 6 possible reading frames is presented in FIG. 13.</p>
    <p num="74">
      An alignment of the MSRV2-A sequence (SEQ ID NO10) with the MSRV-2EL1 sequence (SEQ ID NO12) is presented in FIG. 14. It will be noted that the MSRV-2A sequence is strictly identical to the elongated sequence, apart from a few differences in the region corresponding to the degenerate primers used for obtaining MSRV-2A.
      <br/>
      This region is underlined in this figure; moreover, the hybridization region of the primer SEQ ID NO13 (apart from the cloning tail) is boxed, that of the primer SEQ ID NO14 is presented between square brackets.
      <br/>
      The true sequence of the MSRV-2 genome in this region is probably that of MSRV-2EL1, where it has not been imposed by hybridized primers having low stringency as is the case for MSRV-2A (and MSRV-2B likewise).
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The MSRV-2EL1 sequence hence corresponds to a new sequenced region of the MSRV-2 genome.
      <br/>
      This was verified using new PCR primers defined in MSRV-2EL1 and MSRV-2A, which permitted a specific amplification on the nucleic acids used for the cloning described in this example.
    </p>
    <p num="76">The examples which follow present different results of specific MSRV2 amplifications which confirm the relationship with the presence of corresponding infective agent in the cell cultures described, to permit the isolation of an LM7 type virus (24), and also, in vivo, in patients suffering from MS.</p>
    <p num="77">
      The result of interrogation of the Genebank.RTM. data bank, updated in August 1994, with the MSRV-2EL1 sequence does not show any significant homology with genetic sequences known to date.
      <br/>
      However, the interrogation of the possible translations into amino acids according to the 6 potential reading frames of this MSRV-2EL1 sequence shows partial homologies with bacterial, viral or cellular sequences.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      The absence of PCR amplification with specific primers on normal human DNA shows that the sequence in question is not one of cellular origin.
      <br/>
      MSRV-2 is hence an infective agent exogenous to man.
      <br/>
      However, the degenerate nature of the mixtures of primers used according to variants of the technique described by Shih (33), which enabled the first sequence elements designated MSRV-2A and MSRV-2B to be identified, may have permitted the unforeseen amplification of a genome not belonging to a retrovirus, or even to a gene coding for an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase.
      <br/>
      The almost invariable co-detection of MSRV-1 in cultures originating from MS and expressing reverse transcriptase activity may be explained by a pathological association between two different agents, at least one of which is a retrovirus (MSRV-1).
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The detection in patients of these two types of sequence described in the examples which follow corroborates a pathological association.
      <br/>
      However, only one of these elements may suffice to explain the pathology induced in MS.

      All things considered, our first results of PCR detection of the genome of pathogenic and/or infective agents, it is possible that free "virus" may circulate in the blood stream of patients in an acute, virulent phase, outside the nervous system.

      <br/>
      Furthermore, early detection in individuals not yet displaying neurological signs of MS could make it possible to institute a treatment which would be all the more effective with respect to the subsequent clinical course for the fact that it would precede the lesion stage which corresponds to the onset of neurological disorders.
      <br/>
      Now, at the present time, a diagnosis of MS cannot be established before a symptomatology of neurological lesions has set in, and hence no treatment is instituted before the emergence of a clinical picture suggestive of lesions of the central nervous system which are already significant.

      The diagnosis of an MSRV-1 and/or MSRV-2 infection and/or reactivation in man is hence of decisive importance, and the present invention provided the means of doing this.
