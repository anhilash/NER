    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Design of potent inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT), an enzyme responsible for the reverse transcription of the retroviral RNA to proviral DNA, has been a focal point in translational AIDS research efforts (Greene, W. C., New England Journal of Medicine, 1991, 324, 308-317; Mitsuya, H. et al., Science, 1990, 249, 1533-1544; De Clercq, E., J. Acquired Immune Defic.
      <br/>
      Syndr. Res. Human. Retrovirus, 1992, 8, 119-134).
      <br/>
      Promising inhibitors include nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNI), which bind to a specific allosteric site of HIV-1 RT near the polymerase site and interfere with reverse transcription by altering either the conformation or mobility of RT, thereby leading to noncompetitive inhibition of the enzyme (Kohlstaedt, L. A. et al., Science, 1992, 256, 1783-1790).
    </p>
    <p num="5">NNI of HIV-1 RT include the following:</p>
    <p num="6">
      (a) 1-�(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl�-6-(phenylthio)thymines (HEPT; Tanaka, H. et al., J. Med. Chem., 1991, 34, 349-357; Pontikis, R. et al., J. Med. Chem., 1997, 40, 1845-1854; Danel, K., et al., J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, 2427-2431; Baba, M., et al., Antiviral Res, 1992, 17, 245-264);
      <br/>
      (b) tetrahydroimidazobenzodiazepinethiones (TIBO; Pauwels, R. et al., Nature, 1990, 343, 470-474);
      <br/>
      (c) bis(heteroaryl)piperazines (BHAP; Romero, D. L. et al., J. Med Chem., 1993, 36, 1505-1508);
      <br/>
      (d) dihydroalkoxybenzyloxopyrimidine (DABO; Danel, K. et al., Acta Chemica Scandinavica, 1997, 51, 426-430; Mai, A. et al., J. Med. Chem., 1997, 40, 1447-1454);
      <br/>
      (e) 2'-5'-bis-O-(tertbutyldimethylsilyl)-3'-spiro-5"-(4"-amino-1", 2"-oxathiole-2", 2"-dioxide)pyrimidines (TSAO; Balzarini, J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1992, 89, 4392-4396); and
      <br/>
      (f) phenethylthiazolylthiourea (PETT) derivatives (Bell, F. W. et al., J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 4929-4936; Cantrell, A. S. et al., J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, 4261-4274).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Current protein structure-based drug design efforts rely heavily on crystal structure information of the target binding site.
      <br/>
      A number of crystal structures of RT complexed with NNIs (including  ALPHA -APA, TIBO, Nevirapine, BHAP and HEPT derivatives) have been reported, and such structural information provides the basis for further derivatization of NNI aimed at maximizing binding affinity to RT.
      <br/>
      However, the number of available crystal structures of RT NNI complexes is limited, and no structural information has been reported for RT-PETT complexes or RT-DABO complexes.
      <br/>
      Given the lack of structural information, researchers must rely on other design procedures for preparing active PETT and DABO derivatives.
      <br/>
      One of the first reported strategies for systematic synthesis of PETT derivatives was the analysis of structure-activity relationships independent of the structural properties of RT and led to the development of some PETT derivatives with significant anti-HIV activity (Bell, F. W. et al., J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 4929-4936; Cantrell, A. S. et al., J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, 4261-4274).
      <br/>
      The inclusion of structural information in the drug design process should lead to more efficient identification of promising RT inhibitors.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Although the crystal structure of an RT-NNI complex can be used to provide useful information for the design of a different type of NNI, its application is limited.
      <br/>
      For example, an analysis of the RT-APA ( ALPHA -anilinophenylacetamide) complex structure would not predict that the chemically dissimilar inhibitor TNK (6-benzyl-1-benzyloxymethyl uracil) could bind in the same region.
      <br/>
      The RT-APA structure reveals that there would not be enough room in the APA binding site for the 1-benzyloxymethyl group of TNK (Hopkins, A. L. et al., J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, 1589-1600).
      <br/>
      Nevertheless TNK is known to bind in this region as evidenced by the crystal structure of RT-TNK which shows that RT residues can adjust to accommodate the 1-benzyloxymethyl group.
      <br/>
      Conversely, an analysis of the RT-TNK complex would not predict favorable binding of APA in the TNK binding site.
      <br/>
      The structure does not show how residue E138 can move to accommodate the 2-acetyl group of the  ALPHA -APA inhibitor.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Thus, any NNI binding pocket model based on an individual RT-NNI crystal structure would have limited potential for predicting the binding of new, chemically distinct inhibitors.
      <br/>
      To overcome this problem, the invention disclosed herein uses the NNI binding site coordinates of multiple, varied RT-NNI structures to generate a composite molecular surface.
      <br/>
      A specific embodiment of the invention is a composite molecular surface or binding pocket generated from nine distinct RT-NNI complexes, and reveals a larger than presumed NNI binding pocket not shown or predicted by any of the individual structures alone (FIG. 2A).
      <br/>
      This novel composite binding pocket, together with a computer docking procedure and a structure-based semi-empirical score function, provides a guide to predict the energetically favorable position of novel PETT, DABO, and HEPT derivatives, as well as other novel compounds, in the NNI binding site of RT.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The invention further provides a number of computational tools which set forth a cogent explanation for the previously unexplained and not understood relative activity differences among NNIs, including PETT, DABO, and HEPT derivatives, and reveals several potential ligand derivatization sites for generating new active derivatives.
      <br/>
      Disclosed herein is the structure-based design of novel HEPT derivatives and the design and testing of non-cytotoxic PETT and DABO derivatives which abrogate HIV replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells at nanomolar concentrations with an unprecedented selectivity index of &gt;105.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      One procedure useful in structure-based rational drug design is docking (reviewed in Blaney, J. M. and Dixon, J. S., Perspectives in Drug Discovery and Design, 1993, 1, 301).
      <br/>
      Docking provides a means for using computational tools and available structural data on macromolecules to obtain new information about binding sites and molecular interactions.
      <br/>
      Docking is the placement of a putative ligand in an appropriate configuration for interacting with a receptor.
      <br/>
      Docking can be accomplished by geometric matching of a ligand and its receptor, or by minimizing the energy of interaction.
      <br/>
      Geometric matching is faster and can be based on descriptors or on fragments.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Structure-based drug design efforts often encounter difficulties in obtaining the crystal structure of the target and predicting the binding modes for new compounds.
      <br/>
      The difficulties in translating the structural information gained from X-ray crystallography into a useful guide for drug synthesis calls for continued effort in the development of computational tools.
      <br/>
      While qualitative assessments of RT-inhibitor complexes provide helpful information, systematic quantitative prediction of inhibitory activity of new compounds based on structural information remains a challenge.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      There is a need for more complete information on the structure and flexibility of the NNI binding pocket and for an improved model of the binding pocket to serve as a basis for rational drug design.
      <br/>
      In addition, there is a need for more effective inhibitors of reverse transcriptase, particularly HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The invention disclosed herein addresses these needs by providing a model for the three-dimensional structure of the RT-NNI binding pocket based on the available backbone structure of RT-DNA complex and full structure of RT complexed with several NNI compounds.
      <br/>
      Structural information from multiple RT-NNI complexes was combined to provide a suitable working model.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the NNI binding site coordinates of nine RT-NNI structures is used to generate a composite molecular surface revealing a larger than presumed NNI binding pocket.
      <br/>
      This pocket, together with docking and a structure-based semi-empirical score function, can be used as a guide for the synthesis and analyses of structure-activity relationships for new NNI of RT, including new derivatives of HEPT, DABO, and PETT, as well as novel compounds having little or no relationship to known NNIs.
      <br/>
      The practical utility of this novel composite model is illustrated and validated by the observed superior potency of new PETT and S-DABO derivatives as anti-HIV agents, described herein.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The invention provides novel compounds which inhibit reverse transcriptase (RT) and which inhibit replication of a retrovirus, such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1).
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the novel compounds of the invention are analogs or derivatives of phenethylthiazolylthiourea (PETT), dihydroalkoxybenzyloxopyrimidine (DABO) or 1-�(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl�-6-(phenylthio)thymine (HEPT).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the novel compounds of the invention bind the NNI binding pocket, but are not related to any known NNI.
      <br/>
      Specific compounds of the invention are described more fully in the Detailed Description and in the Examples below.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The invention additionally provides compositions and methods for inhibiting reverse transcriptase activity of a retrovirus, such as HIV-1, by contacting the RT binding site of the retrovirus with a compound of the invention.
      <br/>
      The methods of the invention are useful for inhibiting replication of a retrovirus, such as HIV-1 and include treating a retroviral infection in a subject, such as an HIV-1 infection, by administering a compound or composition of the invention, for example, in a pharmaceutical composition.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The invention further provides a composite ligand binding pocket constructed by superimposing multiple structures of ligand-binding site complexes.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the composite binding pocket is constructed by superimposing the structures of at least one each of the following NNI complexed with RT: a compound, analog or derivative of HEPT or MKC; TNK, APA, Nevipapine, and TIBO.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the composite ligand binding pocket is an HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase (RT) nonnucleoside inhibitor (NNI) binding pocket constructed by superimposing nine structures of NNI-RT complexes, preferably having the coordinates set forth in Table 9.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Using the novel composite binding pocket of the invention, compounds that bind to the NNI binding site of reverse transcriptase can be identified and/or screened.
      <br/>
      For example, a useful inhibitor is identified by analyzing the fit of a candidate compound to the composite binding pocket is analyzed.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the comparing comprises analyzing the molecular surface of the composite binding pocket.
      <br/>
      The extent of contact between the molecular surface of the compound and the molecular surface of the binding pocket can be visualized, and any gap space between the compound and the composite binding pocket can be determined and quantified.
      <br/>
      The candidate inhibitory compound can be docked in the composite binding pocket, and its binding characteristics analyzed.
      <br/>
      For example, an estimate of the inhibition constant for the docked compound can be calculated.
      <br/>
      The value of the inhibition constant is inversely related to the affinity of the candidate compound for the binding pocket.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Using information provided by the composite binding pocket of the invention, novel inhibitors of reverse transcriptase can be designed and screened.
      <br/>
      Using molecular modeling techniques, a compound can be docked into an RT-NNI binding pocket, and the complex analyzed for its binding characteristics.
      <br/>
      Gap space or regions that do not demonstrate optimum close contacts between the compound and the binding pocket are identified, permitting the compound to be modified to better occupy the site.
      <br/>
      In such a method, novel inhibitors of reverse transcriptase are designed and screened.

      FIG. 1A is a model of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) active site, derived primarily from two crystal structures: HIV-1 RT (PDB access code hni) and HIV-1 RT with DNA fragment (PDB access code hmi). The binding site for non-nucleoside inhibitors is labeled NNI. The site for nucleoside inhibitors is labeled dNTP which includes the 3' terminus of DNA. Features describing the geometry of the binding region include the thumb, palm, fingers, and hinge region of RT.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1B shows models of compound I-3 (color coded by atom type) and compound I-4 (in blue) in NNI binding site of HIV reverse transcriptase, positioned by docking procedure. Wing 1 and Wing 2 represent two different regions of the NNI binding site.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2A shows a composite binding pocket of NNI active site of HIV-1 RT. Grid lines represent the collective van der Waals surface of nine different inhibitor crystal structures superimposed in the active site and highlight the available space for binding (inhibitor structures include HEPT, MKC, TNK, APA, Nevirapine, N-ethyl Nevirapine derivative, 8-Cl TIBO, and two 9-Cl TIBO compounds, with PDB access codes rti, rt1, rt2, hni, vrt, rth, hnv, rev and tvr, respectively).

      All scientific and technical terms used in this application have meanings commonly used in the art unless otherwise specified.
      <br/>
      As used in this application, the following words or phrases have the meanings specified.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      As used herein, a "retrovirus" includes any virus that expresses reverse transcriptase.
      <br/>
      Examples of a retrovirus include, but are not limited to, HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-I, HTLV-II, FeLV, FIV, SIV, AMV, MMTV, and MoMuLV.
    </p>
    <p num="26">As used herein, "reverse transcriptase (RT)" refers to an enzyme having an NNI binding site similar to that of HIV-1 RT and to which ligands which bind the composite binding pocket of the invention bind.</p>
    <p num="27">
      As used herein, "reverse transcriptase (RT) activity" means the ability to effect reverse transcription of retroviral RNA to proviral DNA.
      <br/>
      One means by which RT activity can be determined is by measuring viral replication.
      <br/>
      One measure of HIV-1 viral replication is the p24 core antigen enzyme immunoassay, for example, using the assay commercially available from Coulter Corporation/Immunotech, Inc. (Westbrooke, Mich.).
      <br/>
      Another means by which RT activity is analyzed is by assay of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (rRT) activity, for example, using the Quan-T-RT assay system commercially available from Amersham (Arlington Heights, Ill.) and described in Bosworth, et al., Nature 1989, 341:167-168.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As used herein, a compound that "inhibits replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)" means a compound that, when contacted with HIV-1, for example, via HIV-infected cells, effects a reduction in the amount of HIV-1 as compared with untreated control.
      <br/>
      Inhibition of replication of HIV-1 can be measured by various means known in the art, for example, the p24 assay disclosed herein.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      As used herein, a "nonnucleoside inhibitor (NNI)" of HIV reverse-transcriptase (HIV-RT) means a compound which binds to an allosteric site of HIV-RT, leading to noncompetitive inhibition of HIV-RT activity.

      In one embodiment of the invention, the nonnucleoside inhibitor of HIV-RT is a PETT analog.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment of the invention, the nonnucleoside inhibitor of HIV-RT is a DABO analog.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment of the invention, the nonnucleoside inhibitor of HIV-RT is a HEPT analog.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As used herein, a "composite HIV reverse-transcriptase (RT) nonnucleoside inhibitor (NNI) binding pocket" or "composite binding pocket" means a model of the three-dimensional structure of a ligand binding site, such as the nonnucleoside inhibitor binding site of HIV-RT constructed from a composite of multiple ligand-binding site complexes.
      <br/>
      The composite binding pocket represents a composite molecular surface which reveals regions of flexibility within the binding site.
      <br/>
      Flexible residues within the NNI binding site include Tyr180, Tyr181, Tyr318, Tyr319, Phe227, Leu234, Trp229, Pro95, and Glu138 (the latter from the p51l subunit of RT).
      <br/>
      Examples of such a model include, but are not limited to, a composite molecular surface developed with the aid of computer software and based on a composite of coordinates of multiple RT-NNI complexes, as disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the binding pocket has the coordinates set forth in Table 9.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      As used herein, a "compound that fits the nonnucleoside inhibitor (NNI) pocket of reverse transcriptase (RT)" means a compound that substantially enters and binds the NNI binding site on RT.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, a compound that fits the NNI pocket of RT inhibits RT activity.
      <br/>
      Generally, compounds which better fit the NNI pocket of RT contact a greater portion of the available molecular surface of the pocket and are more potent inhibitors of RT activity.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the compound that fits the NNI pocket of RT is a PETT analog.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the compound that fits the NNI pocket of RT is a DABO analog.

      As used herein, "docking" a compound in a binding pocket means positioning a model of a compound in a model of the binding pocket.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the model of the binding pocket can be a composite binding pocket constructed in accordance with the invention.
      <br/>
      The model of the binding pocket can be, for example, based on coordinates obtained from the crystal structure of RT complexed with a NNI.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the docking is performed with the use of computer software, such as the Affinity program within InsightII (Molecular Simulations Inc., 1996, San Diego, Calif.).
      <br/>
      Docking permits the identification of positions of the compound within the binding pocket that are favored, for example, due to minimization of energy.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      As used herein, "minimization of energy" means achieving an atomic geometry of a molecule or molecular complex via systematic alteration such that any further minor perturbation of the atomic geometry would cause the total energy of the system as measured by a molecular mechanics force-field to increase.
      <br/>
      Minimization and molecular mechanics force-fields are well understood in computational chemistry (Burkert, U. and Allinger, N. L., Molecular Mechanics, ACS Monograph, 1982, 177, 59-78, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C.).
    </p>
    <p num="34">As used herein, "comparing" includes visualizing or calculating available space encompassed by the molecular surface of the composite binding pocket of the invention, taking into account the flexibility of residues, such as Tyr180, Tyr181, Tyr318, Tyr319, Phe227, Leu234, Trp229, Pro95, and Glu138 of RT (the latter from the p51 subunit of RT). "Comparing" also includes calculating minimal energy conformations.</p>
    <p num="35">
      As used herein, "gap space" means unoccupied space between the van der Waals surface of a compound positioned within the binding pocket and the surface of the binding pocket defined by residues in the binding site.
      <br/>
      This gap space between atoms represents volume that could be occupied by new functional groups on a modified version of the compound positioned within the binding pocket.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In the present invention, the terms "analog" or "derivative" are used interchangeably to mean a chemical substance that is related structurally and functionally to another substance.
      <br/>
      An analog or derivative contains a modified structure from the other substance, and maintains the function of the other substance, in this instance, maintaining the ability to interact with an NNI-RT binding site.
      <br/>
      The analog or derivative need not, but can be synthesized from the other substance.
      <br/>
      For example, a HEPT analog means a compound structurally related to HEPT, but not necessarily made from HEPT.
    </p>
    <p num="37">As used herein, "alkyl" includes both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms.</p>
    <p num="38">As used herein, "alkene" includes both branched and straight-chain unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms.</p>
    <p num="39">As used herein, "halogen" includes fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.</p>
    <p num="40">
      As used herein "non-hydrogen atom group" includes, but is not limited to, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, halo, hydroxy, alkoxy, thiol, thiolalkyl, amino, substituted amino, phosphino, substituted phosphino, or nitro.
      <br/>
      In addition, cycloalkyl, aryl, and aralkyl groups may be included if the non-hydrogen atom group contains a sufficient number of non-hydrogen atoms.
      <br/>
      Often, a number or range of numbers is specified to indicate the number of non-hydrogen (e.g., C, O, N, S, or P) atoms in the functional group.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a salt that retains the desired biological activity of the parent compound and does not impart any undesired toxicological effects.
      <br/>
      Examples of such salts include, but are not limited to, (a) acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and the like; and salts formed with organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, furmaric acid, gluconic acid, citric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, pamoic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acids, naphthalenedisulfonic acids, polygalacturonic acid; (b) salts with polyvalent metal cations such as zinc, calcium, bismuth, barium, magnesium, aluminum, copper, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, and the like; or (c) salts formed with an organic cation formed from N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine or ethylenediamine; or (d) combinations of (a) and (b) or (c), e.g., a zinc tannate salt; and the like.
      <br/>
      The preferred acid addition salts are the trifluoroacetate salt and the acetate salt.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any material which, when combined with a compound of the invention, allows the compound to retain biological activity, such as the ability to inhibit RT activity, and is non-reactive with the subject's immune system.
      <br/>
      Examples include, but are not limited to, any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions such as oil/water emulsion, and various types of wetting agents.
      <br/>
      Preferred diluents for aerosol or parenteral administration are phosphate buffered saline or normal (0.9%) saline.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Compositions comprising such carriers are formulated by well known conventional methods (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chapter 43, 14th Ed., Mack Publishing Col, Easton Pa. 18042, USA).</p>
    <p num="44">Composite Binding Pocket of the Invention</p>
    <p num="45">
      As shown in FIG. 1, the NNI binding site of HIV-RT rests between the palm and thumb regions of the RT molecular structure, adjacent to the hinge region.
      <br/>
      The NNI binding site includes two distinct regions, indicated in FIG. 1B as Wing 1 and Wing 2, forming a butterfly-shaped binding pocket.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In the method of the invention, a composite ligand binding pocket is constructed by superimposing multiple structures of ligand-binding site complexes, preferably using 5 or more distinct structures.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the composite ligand binding pocket is an HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase (RT) nonnucleoside inhibitor (NNI) binding pocket constructed by superimposing multiple structures of NNI-RT complexes.
      <br/>
      The composite binding pocket is preferably an HIV-1 RT-NNI binding pocket.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      A preferred binding pocket of the invention can be made by superimposition of coordinates, obtainable from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) via access codes disclosed herein, corresponding to the three-dimensional structure of an RT-NNI complex.
      <br/>
      The superimposition of coordinates is preferably based on alignment of the coordinates corresponding to the palm region of the binding pocket due to the greater rigidity of this region.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The superimposing of coordinates can also be accomplished by first using models of the protein backbone and DNA phosphate backbone of the RT-DNA complex structure (with PDB access code hmi) onto a model of an RT mutant complexed with an NNI, such as APA ((2-acetyl-5-methylanilino)(2,6-dibromophyl)acetamide) having PDB access code hni.
      <br/>
      Next, models of one or more additional RT-NNI complexes are superimposed onto the models superimposed above.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the superimposition is based on alignment of the region of RT from residue 100 to 230, preferably by a least squares procedure.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the superimposition is based on alignment of the region of RT from residues 97 to 213.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the superimposition is based on alignment of the palm region and part of the NNI binding site.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the superimposition is based on alignment of the region corresponding to residues 100 to 230 of RT, or on alignment of 117 C alpha atoms of residues 97 to 213, and preferably using a least squares procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      A molecular surface of a binding pocket can then be generated that encompasses all superimposed NNI models.
      <br/>
      One such composite binding pocket constructed from nine individual NNI-RT complex structures, is shown in FIG. 2A. Grid lines in the figure represent the collective van der Waals surface, and highlight space available for binding.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The molecular surface of the complex can be generated, for example, by reading the overlaid coordinates of the complexed inhibitors into a computer program such as GRASP (A.
      <br/>
      Nicholls, GRASP, Graphical Representation and Analysis of Surface Properties, 1992, New York).
      <br/>
      Examples of NNI compounds which can be used in the construction of a binding pocket include, but are not limited to, HEPT, MKC, TNK, APA, Nevirapine, N-ethyl Nevirapine derivative, 8-Cl TIBO, and 9-Cl TIBO (PDB access codes, rti, rt1, rt2, hni, vrt, rth, hnv and rev or tvr, respectively).

    <p num="51">
      Using the composite NNI binding pocket, binding of compounds can be modeled to identify available space within the binding pocket.
      <br/>
      New and more potent NNI inhibitors of RT can be developed by designing compounds to better fit the binding pocket.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      In one embodiment, the composite binding pocket is constructed by superimposing structures of NNI-RT complexes comprising RT complexed with: an HEPT or MKC analog; a TNK analog; an APA analog; a Nevirapine analog; and a TIBO analog.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the composite NNI binding pocket is based on the structure of RT complexed with 9 NNI and on the RT-DNA complex.
      <br/>
      Examples of NNI compounds which can be used in the construction of a binding pocket include, but are not limited to, HEPT, MKC, TNK, APA, Nevirapine, N-ethyl Nevirapine derivative, 8-Cl TIBO, and 9-Cl TIBO structures (PDB access codes, rti, rt1, rt2, hni, vrt, rth, hnv, and tvr and/or rev, respectively).

    <p num="53">Construction and Use of the Binding Pocket</p>
    <p num="54">
      A compound that binds the NMI binding site of reverse transcriptase is identified by comparing a test compound to the composite binding pocket of the invention and determining if the compound fits the binding pocket.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, the test compound may be compared to another inhibitory compound, by superimposing the structures in the binding pocket.
      <br/>
      The test compound is also compared to the binding pocket by calculating the molecular surface of the compound complexed with the composite binding pocket.
      <br/>
      The extent of contact between the molecular surface of the compound and the molecular surface of the binding pocket can be visualized, and the gap space between the compound and the binding pocket can be calculated.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 4A and 4B, gaps between the molecular surface of the binding pocket and the NNI are presented in red, with each red line being 1 angstrom in distance.

    <p num="55">
      To design a novel inhibitor of reverse transcriptase, a compound is docked in the composite binding pocket of the invention.
      <br/>
      Gap space is identified between the compound and the binding pocket, for example, using an algorithm based on a series of cubic grids surrounding the docked compound, with a user-defined grid spacing.
      <br/>
      The compound is then modified to more completely occupy the gap space.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Computerized docking procedures can be used to dock the test compound in the binding pocket and analyze the fit.

      One docking program, DOCK (Kuntz, I. D., et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1982, 161, 269-288; available from University of California, San Francisco), is based on a description of the negative image of a space-filling representation of the receptor that should be filled by the ligand.
      <br/>
      DOCK includes a force-field for energy evaluation, limited conformational flexibility and consideration of hydrophobicity in the energy evaluation.

      LUDI (Bohm, H. J., J. Comp. Aid. Molec. Design, 1992, 6, 61-78; available from Biosym Technologies, San Diego, Calif.) is a program based on fragments rather than on descriptors.
      <br/>
      LUDI proposes somewhat larger fragments to match with the interaction sites of a macromolecule and scores its hits based on geometric criteria taken from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and on criteria based on binding data.

      The procedure enables a search without bias introduced by the researcher.
      <br/>

      The starting conformation in a rigid docking is normally biased towards an energy minimum conformation of the ligand.

      In one embodiment, the method further comprises calculating the inhibition constant of the docked compound.
      <br/>
      Inhibition constants (Ki values) of compounds in the final docking positions can be evaluated using a score function in the program, LUDI (Bohm, H. J., J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des., 1994, 8, 243-256; Bohm, H. J., J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des., 1992, 6, 593-606).
      <br/>
      Predictions of Ki values can be improved by modifications of the LUDI calculation., for example, those described in Example 1.
      <br/>
      First, the molecular surface area can be directly calculated from the coordinates of the compounds in docked conformation using the MS program described in Connolly, M. L., 1983 Science 221:709-713.
      <br/>
      Second, because InsightII does not account for structural rigidity imposed by internal hydrogen bonds, the number of rotatable bonds can be re-evaluated.
      <br/>
      For example, this re-evaluation can be performed by counting the number of rotatable bonds according to the principle introduced by Bohm (supra) and taking out the number of bonds which are not rotatable due to the conformational restraint imposed by the internal hydrogen bond between the thiourea NH and pyridyl N in PETT derivatives.
      <br/>
      Third, the calculation can be modified by the assumption that the conserved hydrogen bond with RT does not deviate significantly from the ideal geometry.
      <br/>
      This assumption is supported by the fact that, in known crystal structures of RT complexes, all hydrogen bonds between NNIs and RT are near the ideal geometry.
      <br/>
      These constraints provide for more predictive Ki values for modeled compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="61">In a preferred embodiment, the compound has a predicted inhibition constant (Ki) of less than about 1  MU M, and the compound in the binding has an estimated molecular surface area greater than 276  Angstrom 2.</p>

      Candidate inhibitors of RT identified or designed by the methods of the invention can be evaluated for their inhibitory activity using conventional techniques which typically involve determining the location and binding proximity of a given moiety, the occupied space of a bound inhibitor, the deformation energy of binding of a given compound and electrostatic interaction energies.
      <br/>

    <p num="108">Strategies for Design and Synthesis of Inhibitors</p>
    <p num="109">
      It has been proposed that NNI interfere with reverse transcription by altering either the conformation or mobility of RT rather than directly preventing the template-primer binding (Tantillo, C. et al., J Mol Biol, 1994, 243, 369-387).
      <br/>
      Specifically, binding of NNI to the NNI binding site (approximately 10  Angstrom  away from the polymerase catalytic site) inhibits RT by interfering with the mobility of the "thumb" and/or position of the "primer grip" (residues 229-231), which interact with the DNA primer strand (FIG. 1A).
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      Computer programs can be used to identify unoccupied (aqueous) space between the van der Waals surface of a compound and the surface defined by residues in the binding site.
      <br/>
      These gaps in atom-atom contact represent volume that could be occupied by new functional groups on a modified version of the lead compound.
      <br/>
      More efficient use of the unoccupied space in the binding site could lead to a stronger binding compound if the overall energy of such a change is favorable.
      <br/>
      A region of the binding pocket which has unoccupied volume large enough to accommodate the volume of a group equal to or larger than a covalently bonded carbon atom can be identified as a promising position for functional group substitution.
      <br/>
      Functional group substitution at this region can constitute substituting something other than a carbon atom, such as oxygen.
      <br/>
      If the volume is large enough to accommodate a group larger than a carbon atom, a different functional group which would have a high likelihood of interacting with protein residues in this region may be chosen.
      <br/>
      Features which contribute to interaction with protein residues and identification of promising substitutions include hydrophobicity, size, rigidity and polarity.
      <br/>
      The combination of docking, Ki estimation, and visual representation of sterically allowed room for improvement permits prediction of potent derivatives.
    </p>
    <p num="111">Design of HEPT Derivatives  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="112">
      New HEPT derivative designs included compounds with added groups at the N-1 (Y--R3) and C-5 (R1) positions and those having oxygen (X or Y) atoms replaced by sulfur.
      <br/>
      Substitution of oxygen by sulfur can aid binding by decreasing the desolvation energy involved in binding.
      <br/>
      The modifications were made such that the HEPT derivative would fit favorably into the butterfly-shaped RT-NNI binding site, (See FIG. 2A) with the benzyl ring residing in one wing and thymine ring in the other.
      <br/>
      For all designed compounds, the benzyl ring is near Trp229 and the N-1 group is near Pro236, a typical position observed in crystal structures.
      <br/>
      The modeling calculations, along with the application of the constructed binding pocket, provided a guideline for the synthesis of lead compounds designed to have potent anti-HIV activity.
      <br/>
      The choice of compounds was also based on synthetic feasibility.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      The region of the NNI site of HIV-1 RT located near the thymine ring nitrogen N-1 of the HEPT analogs contains a Pro236 loop region which is large enough to accommodate N-1 substituents.
      <br/>
      When an inhibitor binds to the NNI site of HIV-1 RT, the presence of a hydrophobic N-1 substituent could influence the Pro loop of this flexible region and provide additional hydrophobic contact leading to stronger binding.
      <br/>
      Docking results indicated that substitution at N-1 also helps the molecule position itself to achieve the best fit within the pocket.
    </p>
    <p num="114">The LUDI analysis showed a substantial increase in contact (lipo score) between the compound and the pocket and the calculation suggested an increase in hydrophobic contact and stronger binding when the substituent on the N-1 tail (R3) is larger in size than a methyl moiety.</p>
    <p num="115">
      The Tyr183 residue of the HIV-1 RT is located in the catalytic region which has a conserved YMDD motif characteristic of reverse transcriptases.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the displacement of this tyrosine residue can interfere with catalysis and render the HIV-1 RT protein inactive.
      <br/>
      It has been suggested that bulky substituents at the 5th position of the thymine ring (R1) could indirectly accomplish this goal by displacing Tyr181 which is near Tyr183.
      <br/>
      The composite binding pocket shows sufficient room for at least a 3-carbon group in this region.
      <br/>
      The addition of a methyl, ethyl or isopropyl group on the 5th position of the thymine ring would lead to a higher affinity for the relatively hydrophobic environment.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      LUDI analysis showed that the hydrophobic contact increases as hydrophobic groups at the 5th position (R1) get bulkier.
      <br/>
      As it binds to the site, the ethyl or isopropyl group causes the nearby Tyr181 residue to rotate away from the inhibitor.
      <br/>
      This change in conformation in turn affects the positions of the neighboring Tyr183 and Tyr188 which can lead to the inactivation of HIV-1 RT.
    </p>
    <p num="117">DABO Derivatives</p>
    <p num="118">
      Detailed analysis of HEPT binding revealed that the N1 substituents of HEPT derivatives occupy the same region of the binding site as the thio (S2) substituents of DABO compounds (See FIG. 7A).
      <br/>
      Therefore, new DABO derivatives were designed and their binding into the NNI site of RT modeled using the crystal structure coordinates of the RT/MKC complex (pdb access code: rt1) and a molecular docking procedure.
      <br/>
      The final coordinates of the docked molecules were then superimposed into the composite binding pocket to evaluate the fit within the RT NNI pocket.
      <br/>
      Notably, multiple sterically allowed unoccupied spatial gaps in the binding site were identified from the docking studies which could be filled by strategically designed functional groups (See FIG. 7B).  (Chemical Structure image '8' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      The docked DABO molecule showed significant space surrounding the 6-benzyl ring and the 5th position of the thymine ring, which led to our design and synthesis of new DABO derivatives.

      Specific DABO compounds are discussed more fully in the Examples, below.

    <p num="120">PETT Derivatives  (Chemical Structure image '9' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="121">
      Each PETT derivative described in the Examples below, can be viewed as two chemical groups linked together by a thiourea group.
      <br/>
      Upon binding RT, the PETT derivative fits into the butterfly-shaped binding site. (See FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      One half of the molecule is composed of a pyridyl thiourea group (compounds I-1 to 4, II-1 to 9, and III-1 to 3) or a 2-aminothiazole group (PETT) which forms an intramolecular hydrogen-bonded 6-membered heterocyclic ring (shown below).
      <br/>
      The other half of the molecule is a piperidinyl ring (II-9), a pyridyl ring (trovirdine), or a phenyl ring separated from the thiocarbonyl group by an ethyl linker.
    </p>
    <p num="122">The positions of the compounds having stronger binding and higher scores (evaluated by LUDI function) all fall into the butterfly-shaped binding region with one part residing in Wing 1 and the other in Wing 2, as illustrated in FIG. 1B. For these compounds the ring closest to the thiocarbonyl group is near the Lys(K)101 loop and the other pyridyl ring is near Trp(W)229 dervatives.</p>
    <p num="123">
      Analysis of trovirdine, revealed multiple sites which can be used for the incorporation of larger functional groups.
      <br/>
      In the composite binding pocket, the docked trovirdine molecule showed a lot of usable space surrounding the pyridyl ring, (R2 -R6), the ethyl linker (R7) and near the 5-bromo position (R8). (See FIG. 5A)  (Chemical Structure image '10' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      Efficient use of this space by strategically designed functional groups would lead to high affinity binding and ultimately result in better inhibitors.
      <br/>
      Our modeling studies suggest that designs using the space available in these regions, including (1) substitutions at R2 -R6 ; (2) substituting heterocyclic rings for the pyridyl ring of trovirdine; (3) substitutions at R7 ; (4) substitutions at R8 ; and (5) maintaining the intramolecular hydrogen bond.
      <br/>
      As shown in the Examples below, modifications in these areas lead to potent RT inhibitors.  (Chemical Structure image '11' not included in text)

    <p num="125">Advantages of the Invention</p>
    <p num="126">
      The invention provides a model for the three-dimensional structure of the RT-DNA complex based on the available backbone structure of RT-DNA complex and full structure of RT complexed with several NNI compounds.
      <br/>
      This is the first model to combine structural information from several complexes into a single composite and provides a suitable working model for the development of novel inhibitory compounds.
      <br/>
      The use of multiple NNI binding site coordinates from RT-NNI structures, as disclosed herein, permits the generation of a composite molecular surface.
      <br/>
      Analysis of the composite NNI binding pocket of the invention reveals that the binding pocket is surprisingly and counter-intuitively larger (instead of smaller) and more flexible (instead of more rigid) than expected.
      <br/>
      This composite NNI binding pocket serves as a guide for the synthesis and analyses of structure-activity relationships for the identification and design of new and more potent NNI of RT.
      <br/>
      The composite binding pocket additionally provides a model for the design of derivatives of NNIs for which crystal structure information is not available (e.g., PETT, DABO).
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      The compounds of the invention are useful for inhibition of RT activity and for inhibition of retroviral replication.
      <br/>
      The compounds disclosed herein provide more potent NNI of RT than known HEPT, DABO and PETT derivatives.
      <br/>
      With all strategies combined, a number of sites are identified for developing more potent derivatives of PETT, such as the incorporation of a larger functional group near the ethyl linker of PETT.
      <br/>
      Hitherto unknown piperidinyl substituted and piperozinyl substituted, as well as morpholinyl substituted PETT derivatives are disclosed which show potent anti-HIV activity at nanomolar concentrations.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      In addition, the compounds of the invention provide a higher selectivity index (S.I.&gt;105) than currently available anti-HIV compounds.
      <br/>
      This high S.I. permits more effective antiviral activity with a minimum of adverse cytotoxic effects.

      The following examples are presented to illustrate the present invention and to assist one of ordinary skill in making and using the same.

    <p num="131">Modeling Procedure</p>
    <p num="132">Construction of the Composite NNI Binding Pocket</p>
    <p num="133">
      A novel model of the NNI binding pocket of RT was constructed by superimposing nine individual RT-NNI crystal structures and then generating a van der Waals surface which encompassed all of the overlaid ligands.
      <br/>
      This "composite binding pocket" surprisingly reveals a different and unexpectedly larger NNI binding site than shown in or predictable from any of the individual structures and serves as a probe to more accurately define the potentially usable space in the binding site (FIG. 2A).
    </p>
    <p num="134">Modeling studies were based on the construction of a binding pocket which encompassed the superimposed crystal structure coordinates of all known RT-NNI complexes, including nine different structures of RT complexed with HEPT, MKC, TNK, APA, Nevirapine, N-ethyl Nevirapine derivative, 9-Cl TIBO (Ren, J. et al., Structure, 1995, 3, 915-926); 9-Cl TIBO (Das, K. et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1996, 264, 1085-1100) and 8-Cl-TIBO (PDB access codes rti, rt1, rt2, hni, vrt, rth, rev, tvr, and hnv, respectively).</p>
    <p num="135">
      The "thumb" region of RT complexes are relatively variable compared with the "palm" region.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a total of 117 C-alpha atoms of the residues from 97 to 213 which cover part of the NNI binding site and the "palm" region were used for a least-squares superimposing procedure within the program O (Jones, T. A. et al., Acta Crystallogr. A., 1991, 47, 110-119).
      <br/>
      Each coordinate set was superimposed onto the same initial coordinate set (RT/9-Cl TIBO). the distance between the pair was minimized by rotating and translating one coordinate set onto the other, minimizing distances between x, y, and z coordinates, according to the method of the program "O".
      <br/>
      The root mean square (RMS) values of the coordinates of the atoms being superimposed are, shown to be 1.00, 0.98, 0.99, 0.62, 0.80, 0.87, 0.94 and 0.65  Angstrom  for HEPT, MKC, TNK, APA, Cyclopropanyl Nevirapine, N-ethyl Nevirapine derivative and two 9-Cl TIBO compounds, respectively.
      <br/>
      Next, the coordinates of the corresponding inhibitor molecules were then transformed according to the same matrices derived from the superimposition.
      <br/>
      Lastly, the overlaid coordinates of all inhibitors were read into the program GRASP (Nicholls, A., GRASP 1992, New York), from which an overall molecular surface was generated providing a binding pocket encompassing all inhibitors.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      As shown in FIG. 2A, the surface of the binding pocket was color coded to reflect characteristics of the overlaid inhibitors, such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic regions.
      <br/>
      The amide nitrogens on the uracil ring of HEPT and TIBO derivatives are color-coded red for hydrogen bonding atoms.
      <br/>
      Oxygen or sulfur atoms of carbonyl, thiocarbonyl, and ester groups, nitrogen atoms of amine groups, and halogen atoms are color-coded blue for polar (hydrophilic) groups.
      <br/>
      Carbon atoms are considered hydrophobic and are colored grey.
      <br/>
      This pocket, referred to as the composite binding pocket, was used as a basis for the analysis of inhibitor binding.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      To generate the coordinates of the composite binding pocket using the InsightII program, each data point of the net defining the surface of the pocket was represented as a water molecule and was saved in Brookhaven Protein Databank (pdb) format.
      <br/>
      To provide a visual frame of reference, the coordinates have been superimposed on the pdb coordinates of an existing crystal structure having pdb access code hnv (HIV-1 RT/8-Cl TIBO complex).
      <br/>
      The coordinates of a composite binding pocket for HIV-1 RT generated by superimposing nine different NNI-RT complexes, are set forth in Table 9.
    </p>
    <p num="138">Docking and Ki Prediction</p>
    <p num="139">
      A computer simulation of the binding of PETT, DABO, and HEPT compounds into the NNI binding site of RT was accomplished using a molecular docking procedure.
      <br/>
      Docking of the compounds into the NNI binding site required the use of X-ray coordinates of an RT-NNI complex (RT/9-Cl-TIBO complex was used for modeling PETT, and the RT/MKC-442 complex was used for modeling DABO and HEPT).
      <br/>
      Upon binding to RT, the compound can fit into a butterfly-shaped NNI binding site (described by Ding et. al), Ding, J. et al., Nat. Struct. Biol., 1995, 2, 407-415 (FIGS. 1B and 2A).
      <br/>
      Once the final docked position of the molecule in the NNI site was determined, the molecule was assigned a score (LUDI), from which an estimation of the inhibition constant (Ki value) was determined.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      After docking and Ki estimation was completed for the inhibitors, evaluation of the docked compounds in the active site of RT involved placing each compound into the composite binding pocket using the same orientation matrix utilized in construction of the pocket.
      <br/>
      The potentially flexible regions in the binding site were then readily identified as were atom sites for future derivatization of the compounds.
      <br/>
      Fixed docking in the Affinity program within InsightII (InsightII, Molecular Simulations Inc., 1996, San Diego, Calif.), was used for docking small molecules to the NNI binding site which was taken from a crystal structure (PDB code rev, RT/9-Cl-TIBO complex).
      <br/>
      The program has the ability to define a radius of residues within a 5  Angstrom  distance from the NNI molecule.
      <br/>
      As the modeling calculations progressed, the residues within the radius were allowed to move in accordance with the energy minimization.
      <br/>
      Ten final docking positions were initially chosen for each inhibitor modeling calculation but failed to reveal more than two promising positions.
      <br/>
      Later, only two calculated positions were set for the search target.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      Calculations were carried out on a Silicon Graphics INIDIGO2 using the CVFF force field in the Discover program and a Monte Carlo search strategy in Affinity (Luty, B. A. et al., J. Comp. Chem., 1995, 16, 454-464).
      <br/>
      No solvation procedures were used.
      <br/>
      Since the total number of movable atoms exceeds 200, Conjugated Gradient minimization was used instead of the Newton minimization method.
      <br/>
      The initial coordinates of the compounds were generated using the Sketcher module within InsightII.
      <br/>
      Each final docking position was then evaluated by a score function in LUDI.
      <br/>
      The top scoring model was then compared with the composite binding pocket and the known crystal structure of similar compounds and used for further analyses.
      <br/>
      The inhibitory constants (Ki values) of the positioned NNI compounds were evaluated using the LUDI score function (Bohm, H. J., J. Comput. Aided. Mol. Des., 1994, 8, 243-256; Bohm, H. J., J. Comput. Aided. Mol. Des., 1992, 6, 593-606).
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      Several modifications were imposed during the calculation of inhibitory constants (Ki values) of the positioned compounds using the LUDI score function (Bohm, H. J. 1994 supra; Bohm, H. J. 1992 supra).
      <br/>
      First, the molecular surface areas (MS) were directly calculated from the coordinates of the compounds in docked conformations using the MS program.
      <br/>
      Second, the number of rotatable bonds (NR), which was assessed inaccurately by INSIGHTII (rigidity imposed by hydrogen bonding was not accounted for in the program), was re-evaluated.
      <br/>
      Third, it was assumed that the conserved hydrogen bond with RT was assumed to not deviate significantly from the ideal geometry.
      <br/>
      This assumption was supported by the fact that in the known crystal structures of RT complexes, all hydrogen bonds between NNIs and RT are near the ideal geometry.
      <br/>
      Last, for the trovirdine compounds, an additional penalty was imposed for a charged group or halogen atoms when positioned near the ring plane of a protein residue such as tryptophan 229 because the interaction was not adequately accounted for in the LUDI score.
      <br/>
      The working modification of the LUDI scoring function for the PETT compounds included subtracting a score of P from the total LUDI score when the ring plane of the Trp229 was within 5  Angstrom  from a para substituent (R):
      <br/>
      LUDI Score=MS*BS*2.93+85 (H-bond)--NR*24.2-100-P; where
      <br/>
      P=200, when R=a hydrophilic group, e.g. --OH or --NO2;
      <br/>
      P=100, when R=a para-halogen atom, e.g. --F, --Cl or --Br;
      <br/>
      P=50, when R=a para-methoxy, e.g. --OMe;
      <br/>
      P=0, when R=a hydrophobic group, e.g. H, CH3;
    </p>
    <p num="143">Consequently, the Ki values for the modeled compounds were more predictable than they would be without such modification (Bohm, H. J. 1994 supra; Bohm, H. J. 1992 supra).</p>
    <p num="144">Contact Surface and Gap Analysis</p>
    <p num="145">
      Independent of the composite binding pocket and as a follow-up to the docking procedure, computer programs were used to analyze the surface complementarity between the compounds and the binding site residues.
      <br/>
      This analysis provided another useful way to examine binding interactions, based solely upon the structure that was used for docking (RT/9-Cl TIBO for PETT and RT/MKC-442 for DABO and HEPT) (Das, K. et al., J. Mol Biol., 1996, 264, 1085-1100).
    </p>
    <p num="146">
      A number of computer programs were written to analyze the surface of the compounds in the NNI binding site of RT and to better visualize any spatial gaps between the compounds and nearby residues of the RT protein.
      <br/>
      The algorithm used in these programs was based on a series of cubic grids surrounding the compound, with a user-defined grid spacing.
      <br/>
      All cubes were coded based on the distance and the nature of the interaction with the protein residues and/or compound atoms.
      <br/>
      The cubes that overlap both protein and compound within the contact radius are displayed as spheres and were selected to represent the buried surface (user-defined contact radius was the van der Waals radius plus an uncertainty factor, dependent on the reliability of source coordinates).
      <br/>
      All other cubes that did not interact with protein residues and were within a certain distance from the compound were selected to represent the gap space (space unoccupied by compound or protein) and are displayed as rods.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      A graphic interface was then used to examine whether the "gap" spheres could be connected with the compounds without intersecting the "contact" spheres.
      <br/>
      If the criterion was met, the points that stemmed from the surface of the compound were defined as an expandable region (eligible for synthetic modification).
      <br/>
      The spheres generated by the programs (shown in FIG. 3) represent the sites buried by protein residues, indicating regions of the compound which are probably not available for derivatization.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      FIG. 4 shows the binding pocket embellished with a grid of red rods which represent unoccupied space between the compound and active site residues, providing a complementary view to that shown by the spheres.
      <br/>
      The grid illustrates the candidate sites for derivatization of the compound and, when used as a distance scale (the length of one rod represents 1  Angstrom ), also indicates the volume available for new functional groups.
    </p>
    <p num="149">One example of a useful program is the "SeeGap" program, whose code is listed below in Example 11, together with instructions for its use.</p>
    <p num="150">Composite NNI Binding Pocket of RT Reveals Protein Flexibility And Future Inhibitor Modification Sites</p>
    <p num="151">
      The integrated structural information surprisingly revealed a much larger binding site than any shown in individual structures and served as a probe to define the potentially usable space in the binding site (FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The three-dimensional binding site can be used as a reference point for the analysis of compounds which have been positioned by a docking procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      Upon inspection of the pocket it was apparent that although there are no large-scale conformnational changes within the NNI binding site, a number of RT protein residues in contact with the inhibitors are relatively flexible and vary from structure to structure.
      <br/>
      These residues include Tyr180, Tyr181, Tyr318, Try319, Phe227, Leu234, Trp229, Pro95, and Glu138 (the latter from p51 subunit of RT).
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      As shown in FIG. 2B, the surface of the composite binding pocket which is overlaid with the RT-TIBO binding site is a short distance (&lt;1.5  Angstrom ) away from or even extends past RT residues 234-236, Y188, F227, and the backbone of K101.
      <br/>
      This indicates that these residues are flexible and can be displaced by the right substituent on an inhibitor.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      The composite binding pocket of the invention, unlike a single crystal structure, is able to integrate the nature and extent of the flexibility of the active site residues in the NNI binding site of RT.
      <br/>
      This uniquely permits prediction of potential modification sites on PETT, DABO, and HEPT derivatives after positioning the compounds in the NNI active site of RT.
      <br/>
      The method for designing new NNI compounds was particularly useful given the fact that no known crystal structures exist for RT-PETT and RT-DABO complexes, a fact which in this case would prevent the successful application of traditional structure-based drug design methods.
      <br/>
      Importantly, the model was validated by experimentally demonstrating the superior potency of newly designed agents, predicted to have strong RT inhibitory activity, based upon the low Ki values estimated.

    <p num="157">
      Compounds listed in Table 1 have been modeled into the NNI binding site of RT (RT/MKC 422 complex) using the docking procedure.
      <br/>
      The modeled positions were compared with the composite binding pocket of the invention, having the coordinates set forth in Table 9.
      <br/>
      Modeling was followed by analysis with the LUDI score function.
    </p>
    <p num="158">
      All of the positions of the compounds with top scores fall into the butterfly-shaped binding site, with the benzyl ring residing in wing 1 and the thymine ring in the wing 2 (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      For all compounds tested, the benzyl ring is near Trp229 and the N-1 group is near Pro236, a typical position observed in crystal structures (FIG. 1B).
      <br/>
      The trend of calculated values listed in Table 1 shows that the Ki value decreases as a result of three factors: para substituents (R2) removed from the benzyl ring, larger alkyl groups added to the thymine ring (R1), and sulfur atoms substituted for oxygen (at X and/or Y).
      <br/>
      The modeling calculations, along with the application of the composite NNI binding pocket, provided a guideline for the synthesis of lead compounds designed to have potent anti-HIV activity.
      <br/>
      The choice of compounds was also based on synthetic feasibility.

    <p num="185">Modeling and Design of DABO Compounds</p>
    <p num="186">
      The calculated molecular coordinates of DABO compounds which were energy-minimized and docked into the NNI binding site adopted a conformation remarkably similar to that of the crystal structure of compound 3b.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7B shows the modeled coordinates superimposed on the crystal structure coordinates of 3b and illustrates their conformational similarity, suggesting that the final docked positions of the DABO compounds in the NNI pocket were energetically favorable and quite suitable for these studies.
      <br/>
      Multiple sterically allowed unoccupied spatial gaps in the binding site were identified from the docking studies which could be filled by strategically designed functional groups (FIG. 7B).
    </p>
    <p num="187">
      The docked DABO molecule (compound 3a) unexpectedly showed significant space surrounding the benzyl ring and the 5th position of the thymine ring, which led to design of compounds 3b, 3c and 3d.
      <br/>
      The inhibition constants of the docked molecules were calculated based on a LUDI score function and are listed in Table 3.
      <br/>
      The calculated Ki values suggested that compounds 3c and 3d would be particularly active inhibitors of RT.  (Chemical Structure image '17' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="188">
      Compound 3d, which differs from compound 3c by the addition of two methyl groups to the benzyl ring, provides more hydrophobic contact with the NNI binding pocket and was predicted to be more potent than compound 3c, based on the modeling studies.
      <br/>
      Calculations indicate that compounds 3a-3d have progressively larger molecular surface areas but still maintain approximately the same percentage of the molecular surface area in contact with the protein residues.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the calculated contact surface area between the protein and the compound increases in the following order: compound 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d.
      <br/>
      This increased surface area in turn dictates a decrease in calculated Ki values, with 3a having the worst value and 3d the best.

    <p num="189">
      The Tyr183 residue of the HIV RT is located in the catalytic region which has a conserved YMDD motif characteristic of reverse transcriptases.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the displacement of this tyrosine residue can interfere with catalysis and render the HIV-1 RT protein inactive.
      <br/>
      Bulky substituents at the 5th position of the thymine ring could indirectly accomplish such inactivation by displacing Tyr181 which is near Tyr183 (Ding, J. et al., Nat. Struct. Biol., 1995, 2, 407-415).
      <br/>
      The composite binding pocket shows sufficient room for at least a 3-carbon group at the 5th position.
      <br/>
      The addition of a methyl, ethyl or isopropyl group at the 5th position of the thymine ring is expected to lead to higher affinity for the relatively hydrophobic environment at this location of the binding pocket.
      <br/>
      The favorable hydrophobic contact increases as the hydrophobic group at the 5th position gets bulkier.
      <br/>
      As the DABO derivative binds to the site, the ethyl or isopropyl group can also cause the nearby Tyr181 residue to rotate away from the inhibitor.
    </p>
    <p num="190">
      Modeling studies showed that this change in conformation in turn affects the positions of neighboring Tyr183 and Tyr188 which may contribute to the inactivation of HIV-1 RT.
      <br/>
      The benzyl ring of compounds 3a-3d is located near a region surrounded by the hydrophobic ring planes of residues Trp229, Pro95, Y188 and Y181.
      <br/>
      The analysis of compounds 3a-3c in the composite binding pocket suggests that the benzyl ring would be located on the boundary of the pocket, near residue Y188.
      <br/>
      A para substituent of the ring is situated perpendicular to the ring plane of nearby Trp229, within van der Waals contact, and leaves a lot of space unfilled between the compound and Pro95.
      <br/>
      With a slight conformational rotation of the benzyl ring, compound 3d, with the addition of two methyl groups, was found to better fill the composite binding pocket (FIG. 7B).
      <br/>
      Such observations indicate that further modifications to the benzyl ring could lead to even more potent inhibitors.

      The trend of the calculated Ki values based on the modeling and on the use of the composite binding pocket, with surprising accuracy, predicted the trend of the experimentally determined IC50 values from HIV replication assays.
      <br/>
      Compounds 3a-3d were tested for RT inhibitory activity in cell-free assays using purified recombinant HIV RT (listed as IC5 o�rRT� in Table 4), as well as by in vitro assays of anti-HIV activity in HTLVIIIB-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (IC50 �p24� in Table 4) (Zarling, J. M. et al., Nature, 1990, 347, 92-95; Erice, A. et al., Antimicrob.
      <br/>
      Ag. Chemother., 1993, 37, 835; Uckun, F. M. et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 1998, 42, 383).
    </p>
    <p num="194">
      Larger compounds which better fill the composite binding pocket and have lower calculated Ki values showed better IC50 �rRT� values.
      <br/>
      This is reflected by the enhancement of the inhibitory activity with the addition of progressively larger groups such as methyl (3a), ethyl (3b), and isopropyl (3c) at the C-5 position of the thymine ring (see Table 4).
      <br/>
      The same trend was also observed for IC50 �p24� values.
    </p>
    <p num="195">
      The lead DABO derivative, 5-isopropyl-2-�(methylthiomethyl)thio�-6-(benzyl)-pyrimidin-4-(1H)-one (compound 3c), elicited potent anti-HIV activity with an IC50 value less than 1 nM for inhibition of HIV replication (measured by p24 production in HIV-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and showed no detectable cytotoxicity (inhibition of cellular proliferation was &gt;100  MU M as measured by MTA) (Table 4).
      <br/>
      In contrast to all previously published data for DABO and S-DABO derivatives which were less active than AZT and MKC-442 (Danel, K. et al., Acta Chemica Scandinavica, 1997, 51, 426-430; Mai, A. et al., J. Med Chem., 1997, 40, 1447-1454; Danel, K. et al., J. Med Chem., 1998, 41, 191-198) and showed selectivity indices of &lt;1,000, the novel compound 3c was more than 4-fold more active than AZT and MKC-442, and abrogated HIV replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells at nanomolar concentrations with an unprecedented selectivity index (=IC50 �MTA�/IC50 �p24�) of &gt;100,000.

      The X-ray crystal structure of 3b was determined to compare its conformation to that of the compound after docking into the NNI binding site.
      <br/>
      The refined small molecule X-ray crystal structure of compound 3b is represented as an ORTEP drawing in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The calculated molecular coordinates of DABO compounds which were energy-minimized and docked into the NNI binding site adopted a conformation remarkably similar to that of the crystal structure of compound 3b.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7B shows the modeled coordinates superimposed on the crystal structure coordinates of 3b and illustrates their conformational similarity, suggesting that the final docked positions of the DABO compounds in the NNI pocket were energetically favorable.

    <p num="245">Structure-based Design and Docking of Novel PETT Derivatives into Composite NNI Binding Pocket I</p>
    <p num="246">
      A novel model of the NNI binding pocket of RT was constructed by carefully superimposing the coordinates of 9 individual RT-NNI crystal structures and then generating a van der Waals surface which encompassed all of the overlaid ligands.
      <br/>
      The integrated structural information of this "composite binding pocket" revealed an unexpectedly different and much larger NNI binding site than shown in or predictable from any of the individual structures and served as a probe to more accurately define the potentially usable space in the binding site (FIG. 2a).
      <br/>
      A number of protein residues in contact with the inhibitors are relatively flexible and vary from structure to structure.
      <br/>
      These residues include Tyr180, Tyr181, Tyr318, Try319, Phe227, Leu234, Trp229, Pro95, and Glu138 (from p51 subunit of RT).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2b, the surface of the composite binding pocket is a short distance away from (&lt;1.5  Angstrom ) or even extends past RT residues 234-236, Y188, F227, and the backbone of K101.
      <br/>
      This indicates that these residues are flexible and can be displaced by the right inhibitor.
      <br/>
      The composite binding pocket, unlike an individual crystal structure, is able to summarize the nature and extent of the flexibility of the active site residues.
      <br/>
      This allowed prediction of potential modification sites on the PETT derivatives I after positioning the compounds in the RT active site (see Methods).
    </p>
    <p num="247">
      A computer simulation of the binding of PETT compounds into the NNI binding site of RT was accomplished using a molecular docking procedure.
      <br/>
      Docking of PETT and trovirdine into the NNI binding site required the use of X-ray coordinates of an RT/NNI complex (in this case the RT/9-Cl-TIBO complex).
    </p>
    <p num="248">
      Upon binding to RT, the compound can fit into a butterfly-shaped NNI binding site (described by Ding, J., et al., Nat. Struct. Biol., 1995, 2, 407-415) (FIGS. 1B and 2).
      <br/>
      PETT and its derivatives such as compounds I-1-4 could be viewed as two chemical groups linked together by a thiourea group (Table 5).
      <br/>
      One half of the molecule is composed of a 2-aminothiazole group (PETT) or a pyridylthiourea group (compounds I-1-4) which forms an intramolecular hydrogen-bonded heterocyclic ring.
      <br/>
      The other half of the molecule is a phenyl or heterocyclic ring separated from the thiocarbonyl group by an ethyl linker.
    </p>
    <p num="249">
      Once the final docked position of the molecule in the NNI site was determined, the molecule was assigned a score, from which an estimation of the inhibition constant (Ki value) was determined (Table 5).
      <br/>
      When trovirdine was docked into the NNI binding site of RT it had a higher binding score than PETT and fit into the butterfly-shaped binding region with one part residing in Wing 1 and the other in Wing 2 (FIG. 1B).
      <br/>
      The ring closest to the thiocarbonyl group resided near the Lys(K)101 loop and the other pyridyl ring was near Trp(W)229.
    </p>
    <p num="250">
      After docking and Ki estimation was completed for the PETT inhibitors, evaluation of the docked compounds in the active site of RT involved placing each compound into the composite binding pocket using the same orientation matrix utilized in its construction.
      <br/>
      The potentially flexible regions in the binding site were then readily identified as were atom sites for future derivatization of the compounds.
      <br/>
      The area within Wing 2 and the residues near the thiourea group seemed to be the most forgiving regions in the binding site of RT.
      <br/>
      This observation was also supported by the analysis of gaps in atom-to-atom contact between the protein and the inhibitor.

      Analysis of the molecular surface of the compounds in the NNI binding site of RT included visualization of spatial gaps between the compounds and nearby residues of the RT protein, as described above for Example 1.
      <br/>
      The spheres generated are shown in FIG. 3, and indicate regions of the compound which are probably not available for derivatization.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows the binding pocket embellished with a grid of red rods which represent unoccupied space between the compound and active site residues, providing a complementary view to that shown by the spheres in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The grid illustrates the candidate sites for derivatization of the compound and, when used as a distance scale (the length of one rod represents 1  Angstrom ), also indicates the volume available for new functional groups.
      <br/>
      After the docked PETT compounds were subjected to the grid (gap) analysis, a number of gaps in the binding site were identified (FIGS. 3-4), some of which could be filled by strategically designed functional groups on new PETT derivatives.
      <br/>
      It was postulated that a more efficient use of such sterically allowed unoccupied spatial gaps in the binding site could be achieved by replacing the 2-pyridyl ring of trovirdine with a 1-piperidinyl (compound I-3) or 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl moiety (compound I-4) and yield potentially more active PETT compounds with larger molecular surface areas, higher Ludi scores, and lower Ki values (Table 5).
    </p>
    <p num="253">
      Compounds I-1, I-3 and I-4 were subjected to the same docking procedure and Ki calculation used to analyze the parent compounds PETT and trovirdine (compound I-2).
      <br/>
      The molecular surface area of the compounds calculated after docking increased in the following order: PETT, compound I-1, I-2 (trovirdine), I-3, and I-4.
      <br/>
      At docked positions, the atom surface area in contact with the protein residues constituted an average of 84% of the entire molecular surface (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      We used this average value in the calculation of the inhibitory constant (Ki) based on the Ludi score function.
      <br/>
      Calculated Ki values for I-3 and I-4 predicted that these compounds would have potency superior to that of trovirdine.
      <br/>
      The calculated Ki values of our compound I-3 (0.6  MU M), and compound I-4 (0.2  MU M) were better than those of known compounds PETT (2.4  MU M), compound I-1 (1.7  MU M) and trovirdine (0.7  MU M).

      An energy-minimized model of compound I-4 in the RT binding site had the largest molecular surface area in contact with the protein and thus achieved the highest lipophilicity score.
      <br/>
      The docking studies indicated that the 2-methoxy group of compound I-4 is situated beneath the ethyl linker and fits favorably into a cavity of the binding pocket, providing contact with protein residues that cannot be achieved by trovirdine.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the 5-methoxy group of compound I-4 provides close contact with residues Pro95 and Trp229.
      <br/>
      The trend of the calculated Ki values accurately predicted the trend of the experimentally determined IC50 values from HIV replication assays, as shown in Table 5, thereby providing conclusive evidence of the practical utility of the composite model.
    </p>
    <p num="262">
      The lead compound, I-4 with the lowest calculated Ki values of the series, was 8-times more potent than trovirdine against purified recombinant HIV-RT using the cell-free Quan-T-RT system (IC50�rRT� was 0.1  MU M for I-4 versus 0.8  MU M for trovirdine).
      <br/>
      Compound I-4 also elicited potent anti-HIV activity with IC50 values of less than 0.001  MU M in 3 of 3 independent experiments which was consistently lower than the IC50 values for trovirdine (0.007  MU M) and AZT (0.008  MU M).
      <br/>
      None of the PETT derivatives were cytotoxic at concentrations as high as 100  MU M. Therefore, the calculated selectivity index (IC50 �MTA�/IC50 �p24�) of compounds I-3 and I-4 were greater than 105.
    </p>
    <p num="263">
      All active PETT compounds listed in Table 5 are able to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the nitrogen atom of pyridine or thiazole and an amide hydrogen of the thiourea group, as shown in Wing 1 of FIG. 1B. The intramolecular hydrogen bond was also observed in our small molecule crystal structure of compound I-3 (data not shown).
      <br/>
      The energy gained by the formation of such a hydrogen bond has been estimated to be about 5 kca/mol (Bell, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 4929-4936).
      <br/>
      Our docking results showed that the internal hydrogen bond keeps the pyridyl thiourea (or thiazolylthiourea) in a more rigid conformation and allows the molecule to adopt the appropriate geometry to occupy Wing 1 of the binding site, and at the same time maintain a hydrogen bond with a backbone carbonyl of residue Lys 101 (FIG. 1B).
    </p>
    <p num="264">
      Compounds I-3 and I-4 differ from trovirdine at the proposed Wing 2 binding region of the molecule.
      <br/>
      Compound I-3 has a heterocyclic ring which replaces the pyridyl ring and compound 4 has two methoxy groups added at meta and ortho positions of the phenyl ring.
      <br/>
      The molecular surface areas of compounds I-3 and I-4 are larger than that of trovirdine, as calculated from the coordinates of the predicted active conformation obtained from docking.
      <br/>
      This larger surface area results in a better lipophilic score and lower calculated Ki value (Table 5).
      <br/>
      Both pyridylethyl and piperidinylethyl groups occupy the same region of Wing 2 near Tyr229 (FIGS. 2 and 5).
      <br/>
      Our composite binding pocket shows a space large enough to accommodate a group larger than the pyridyl ring of trovirdine.
      <br/>
      Docking results and analyses of gaps indicate that the pyridyl ring of trovirdine has multiple sites which can be used for incorporation of larger groups.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 5, there is sufficient space surrounding the pyridylethyl ring for the addition of a two- to four-atom substituent at any of the ring positions.
      <br/>
      Both sides of the pyridylethyl ring plane of trovirdine are relatively exposed in the pocket (FIG. 3A) and can accommodate additional substituents (FIG. 4A).
      <br/>
      This prediction was confirmed by the potency of compound I-4 (which contains ortho, meta-dimethoxy substituents), in inhibitng HIV replication.
    </p>
    <p num="265">
      The piperidinyl group of I-3 is puckered and therefore occupies a larger overall volume than the planar pyridyl ring of trovirdine and is in close contact with residues Leu234 and Leu100, the latter of which can mutate to isoleucine, frequently found in a drug-resistant RT mutant strain.
      <br/>
      In contrast to previously reported extensive attempts at expanding within the pyridyl ring plane (Bell, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 4929-4936; Cantrell, A. S., et al., J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, 4261-4274; Ahgren, C., et al., Antimicrob.
      <br/>
      Agents Chemotherapy, 1995, 39, 1329-1335), the success of our efforts at modification perpendicular to the ring plane introduces new possibilities to develop more potent inhibitors which combine both modifications.
      <br/>
      The piperidinyl ring is conformationally more flexible than an aromatic ring has the advantage of fitting an uncompromising binding pocket more effectively, despite the expense paid for loss of entropy upon binding.
      <br/>
      The analysis shown in FIGS. 3, 4, and 5 provides new insights for modifications which are different from those of trovirdine derivatives.
      <br/>
      Various combinations of double substitutions at axial or equatorial positions of the piperidinyl ring generate derivatives with a broader range of curvatures than trovirdine derivatives and better fit Wing 2 which itself contains some curvature.
    </p>
    <p num="266">
      In summary, a composite binding pocket was constructed which integrated all available crystal structure information about the NNI binding site of RT.
      <br/>
      This novel computer-generated model was an unexpectedly effective tool that helped to much better comprehend the flexible nature of the binding pocket and to identify specific areas for structural improvements of the inhibitors.
      <br/>
      Nine lead NNI compounds from published crystal structures were analyzed.
      <br/>
      With all strategies combined, a number of previously unknown candidate sites for developing more potent derivatives of PETT were identified, such as substituting a bulkier piperidinyl group or an ortho/meta substituted phenyl group in place of an unsubstituted ring which resulted in enhanced inhibitory activity.
      <br/>
      The presented experimental results demonstrate that two novel PETT derivatives which resulted from our structure-based design efforts using the composite binding pocket are remarkably potent and noncytotoxic anti-HIV agents with unprecedented selectivity indices of &gt;105.
      <br/>
      The superior activity of these designed PETT compounds would not have been predictable from existing information about trovirdine alone, or from any single crystal structure of RT complexed with an NNI.

      A computer simulation of the binding of the target PETT derivatives into the NNI binding site of RT was accomplished using a molecular docking procedure.
      <br/>

    <p num="271">
      Trovirdine derivatives could be viewed as two chemical groups linked together by a thiourea group (Table 6).
      <br/>
      One half of the molecule is composed of a pyridylthiourea group (compounds II-1-9) which forms an intramolecular hydrogen-bonded heterocyclic ring (shown in trovirdine structure).
      <br/>
      The other half of the molecule is a pyridyl ring separated from the thiocarbonyl group by an ethyl linker.
    </p>
    <p num="272">
      When trovirdine was docked into the NNI binding site of RT, it fit into the butterfly-shaped binding region (described by Ding, et al., Nat. Struct. Biol., 1995, 2, 407-415) with one part of the molecule residing in Wing 1 and the other in Wing 2.
      <br/>
      The ring closest to the thiocarbonyl group resided near the Lys(K)101 loop and the other pyridyl ring was near Trp(W)229.
    </p>
    <p num="273">
      Compounds II-1-9 were positioned according to this binding mode into the RT/9-Cl-TIBO active site by a docking procedure described above for Example 1.
      <br/>
      The results are shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      One of the NH groups of the thiourea part of these compounds consistently formed a hydrogen bond with the backbone of K101.
    </p>
    <p num="274">
      Once the final, energetically favored docked position of the molecule in the NNI site was determined, a LUDI score was assigned, from which an estimation of the inhibition constant (Ki value) was determined (Table 6).
      <br/>
      The calculated Ki values, ranging from 0.4  MU M to 0.8  MU M suggested that compounds II-2-7 would be active inhibitors of RT.
      <br/>
      The modeling data, shown below in Table 6, predicted that compounds II-2 to II-7 would be as potent as or more potent than trovirdine for inhibiting RT.

      The docking results showed that the meta-methoxy group of II-4 is situated near Pro95 and Trp229 in the binding site, providing contact with these protein residues which cannot be achieved by trovirdine (FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      Based on the IC50 �rRT� values of all methoxy compounds, the meta-methoxy substituted compound II-4, which had a Ki value of 0.4  MU M, showed greater inhibitory activity against recombinant HIV RT and it was approximately 2-fold more potent than trovirdine (IC50 �rRT� was 0.4  MU M for compound II-4 versus 0.8  MU M for trovirdine).
      <br/>
      Compound II-4 abrogated HIV replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells at nanomolar concentrations with an IC50 value of 3 nM and a selectivity index (SI) of &gt;3 * 104 (Table 6).
    </p>
    <p num="280">Fluorine Substitutions</p>
    <p num="281">
      Among the fluorine (F) substituted compounds II-2, II-5, and II-8, both meta and ortho fluoro compounds were at least 7-fold more active than trovirdine (IC50 �p24� &lt;1 nM) (Table 6).
      <br/>
      Based on the IC50 �rRT� values, compounds with F substitutions at the meta and ortho positions had nearly the same inhibitory activity against recombinant HIV RT but the para-F substituted compound was 10-fold less active.
      <br/>
      The color-coded composite binding pocket (FIG. 5) also shows that Wing 2 is mostly hydrophobic except for the region near the ortho positions on both sides of the phenyl ring where polar groups such as halogen atoms would be compatible.
      <br/>
      Trovirdine, however, lacks such ring substitutents which could provide favorable interactions with these regions of the binding site based on our modeling.
      <br/>
      Substitutions at the meta position could be on the polar region or the hydrophobic region depending on the chemical group and its consequent conformational change (FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      The m-F substituent of compound II-5 is probably exposed to the polar (blue) region and therefore is as active as the o-F group which would also be exposed to the polar region according to our modeling.
      <br/>
      The trend in IC50 �rRT� values observed for F-substituted compounds may reflect such a preference.
      <br/>
      The p-F atom, which is small in size but electronegative, may not be compatible with the location of the ring plane of nearby hydrophobic Trp229 and could contribute to the lower activity.
      <br/>
      We postulate that this same incompatibility should be observed for any other highly hydrophilic group at the para position, and that an additional binding penalty be imposed to better quantitate such features when undertaking modeling studies.
    </p>
    <p num="282">Chlorine Substitutions</p>
    <p num="283">
      Chlorine (Cl) substituted compounds II-3, II-6, and II-9 show a trend of observed biological activities which differs from that of both the fluorine and methoxy compounds.
      <br/>
      Like the p-F substituted compound which was less active than other F-substituted compounds, the p-Cl compound was less active than the o-Cl compound based on the IC50 �rRT� values.
      <br/>
      Unlike the m-F substituted compound which was as active as the o-F substituted compound, the m-Cl compound was not as active as the o-Cl substituted compound.
      <br/>
      According to our modeling, o-Cl is the most likely substituent to be situated near a limited polar region at Wing 2, an interaction which would be favorable.
      <br/>
      The o-Cl compound, like the o-F compound discussed above, was in fact more active than trovirdine, as was predicted by the modeling procedure and by the use of the composite binding pocket.
    </p>
    <p num="284">Hydrophobic Group Preferred At The Para Position</p>
    <p num="285">
      When IC50 �rRT�values of all compounds with para substitutions are compared (II-7-9), a distinct trend is evident: the p-methoxy (OMe) compound (7) is favored over the p-halogen group compounds (II-8 and II-9) (Table 6).
      <br/>
      Only the p-OMe substituted PETT derivative, compound II-7, is comparable to trovirdine in its inhibitory activity against recombinant HIV RT.
      <br/>
      Compound II-7 inhibited HIV replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells with an IC50 value of 15 nM (Table 6).
      <br/>
      This p-OMe preference is consistent with the understanding of the color-coded composite binding pocket at Wing 2, where the binding pocket residues near the para position are relatively hydrophobic.
      <br/>
      One can reasonably assume, based on chemical intuition and the available inhibition data which is consistent with the modeling, that para substituted hydrophobic groups positioned near a hydrophobic region of the pocket are most preferred, followed by halogens, and finally hydrophilic groups.
    </p>
    <p num="286">Conclusions</p>
    <p num="287">In summary, the data revealed the following structure-activity relationships affecting the potency of PETT derivatives with substitutions on various positions of the phenyl ring:</p>
    <p num="288">
      1) methoxy substitution is more favorable at the meta position than at the ortho or para positions;
      <br/>
      2) fluorine substitution is favorable at ortho and meta positions but not at the para position;
      <br/>
      3) chlorine substitution is favorable only at the ortho position;
      <br/>
      4) a hydrophobic group is more desirable than a polar group or hydrophilic group at the para position.
      <br/>
      These results were generally consistent with predictions made during modeling.
    </p>
    <p num="289">
      The use of the composite NNI binding pocket allowed the identification and structure-based design of at least 3 promising PETT derivatives with ortho-F (II-2), ortho-Cl (II-3), and meta-F (II-5) substituents on the phenyl ring.
      <br/>
      These novel PETT derivatives were more active than trovirdine (as predicted) or AZT and showed potent anti-HIV activity with IC50 �p24� values &lt;1 nM and selectivity indices (SI) of &gt;100,000 (Table 6).
    </p>

    <p num="291">Design of Heterocyclic PETT Derivatives III</p>
    <p num="292">
      In the course of the search for potent NNIs, a computer model has been developed in which a composite binding pocket was constructed from nine individual crystal structures of RT-NNI complexes.
      <br/>
      Modeling studies lead to the identification of a number of NNIs with IC50 values beyond 1 nM for the inhibition of HIV replication (measured by p24 production in HIV-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and showed no detectable cytotoxicity against human T-lymphocytes (inhibition of cellular proliferation was &gt;100  MU M as measured by MTA).
    </p>
    <p num="293">
      The detailed analysis of trovirdine, a potent PETT derivative, revealed multiple sites which can be used for the incorporation of larger functional groups.
      <br/>
      In the composite binding pocket, the docked trovirdine molecule showed a lot of usable space surrounding the pyridyl ring, the ethyl linker and near the 5-bromo position (shown in structure of PETT derivative).
      <br/>
      It was proposed that efficient use of this space by strategically designed functional groups would lead to high affinity binding and ultimately result in better inhibitors.

      The effect of systematic substitutions of the phenyl ring of trovirdine with various heterocyclic rings was studied.
      <br/>
      This provides an alternative strategy to fit the compound into the relatively flexible and spacious Wing 2 region (as illustrated by the composite binding pocket).
      <br/>
      In the subsequent modeling studies these heterocyclic rings, which have a larger volume than the pyridyl ring of trovirdine, were shown to better fill the Wing 2 region of the composite binding pocket.
    </p>
    <p num="296">
      The piperidinyl, piperzinyl and morpholinyl rings of compounds III-1-3 are puckered and therefore occupy a larger overall volume than the planar pyridyl ring of trovirdine and are in close contact with residues Leu234 and Leu100, the latter of which can mutate to isoleucine, frequently found in a drug-resistant RT mutant strain.
      <br/>
      The encouraging results from efforts to make modifications perpendicular to the ring plane introduces new possibilities to develop more potent inhibitors of RT.
    </p>
    <p num="297">
      The heterocyclic rings which are conformationally more flexible than an aromatic ring may have the advantage of fitting an uncompromising binding pocket more effectively, despite the expense paid for loss of entropy upon binding.
      <br/>
      Various combinations of double substitutions at axial or equatorial positions of these heterocyclic rings would generate derivatives with a broader range of curvatures than trovirdine derivatives and would serve to better fit Wing 2 which itself contains some curvature.

      Preparation
      <br/>
      1.
      <br/>
      Extract the source codes at the lines indicated.
      <br/>
      The first program is a C-shell command file and should be named as "SeeGap"; the second program should be named as "pdbmax.f"; the third "gridbox.f" and fourth "chgcolor.f".
      <br/>
      2. Compile the source codes: for the first, chmod+x SeeGap; the second, third, and fourth by "f77-o file file.f".
      <br/>
      3. You should now have the executive versions of the programs named as "SeeGap", "pdbmax", "gridbox" and "chgcolor".
      <br/>
      The preparation is ready.
    </p>
    <p num="308">
      Use the Program
      <br/>
      1.
      <br/>
      Open "insightII" window, and read in the coordinates of the protein and the coordinates of the ligand.
      <br/>
      Next, assign the potential to both coordinates by builder module within "insightII" (see insight II manual).
      <br/>
      2. Position the ligand in the binding site by a docking procedure, if the position of the ligand is unknown.
      <br/>
      3. Using subset/interface command, determine the coordinates of the protein that immediately surround the ligand by a defined distance, e.g., 7 angstroms.
      <br/>
      Write out the coordinates and name it as "bind.pdb"; write out the coordinates of the ligand and name it as "ligand.pdb".
      <br/>
      4. Adjust the input parameters in the command file "SeeGap" as appropriate.
      <br/>
      5. Run the program by typing "SeeGap ligand.pdb bind.pdb&gt;out&amp;".
      <br/>
      6. The results should be in three files: contact.pdb, which represents the grid points on the surface of the ligand and in contact with the protein residues; gap.pdb, which represents the grid points available for modification; and lig.pdb, which represents the grid points covering the ligand.
      <br/>
      7. Use a molecular graphics software to display these coordinates.
