      The present invention employs an internal inductive antenna capable of generating a helicon wave for generating a plasma.
      <br/>
      One embodiment of the present invention employs loop type antenna secured within a bell shaped portion of the chamber.

      Another embodiment employs a flat coil type antenna secured within the chamber.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiments, the internal antenna of the present invention is constructed to prevent sputtering of the antenna.

      The antenna may be formed of a non-sputtering conductive material, or may formed a conductive material surrounded, completely or partially, by a non-sputtering jacket.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the non-sputtering jacket may be coupled to the chamber wall so that heat generated by the antenna is transferred between the jacket and the chamber wall by conduction.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the non-sputtering jacket is formed of a material that also is electrically insulative with the surface of the antenna exposed to plasma being segmented to inhibit eddy current in conductive deposits.
      <br/>
      The gaps separate the exposed surface of the antennas so that conductive deposits are inhibited from electrically joining the separated surfaces, while inhibiting plasma generation within the gaps.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Technical Field
    </p>
    <p num="3">The invention relates to inductive antenna plasma reactors.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Conventional inductively coupled plasma reactors typically have a large coiled inductive antenna to provide RF power for generating plasma.
      <br/>
      The large coil antenna, typically is located outside the reactor chamber and couples RF power through the chamber wall.
      <br/>
      Such a configuration has several drawbacks.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A problem with conventional helicon source reactors is that conductive material may deposit on the walls of the reactor and degrade the efficiency and performance of the reactor.
      <br/>
      With a conventional etch reactors has in the past been used to etch aluminum from the surface of a workpiece.
      <br/>
      This etching process produces byproducts comprising mostly aluminum chlorides (AlClx) and fragments of photoresist, which tend to deposit on the walls of the reactor chamber.
      <br/>
      The byproducts of an aluminum etch have no significant effect on etch rates because they are almost totally non-conductive.
      <br/>
      Such is not the case when electrically conductive etch byproducts are produced and deposited on the chamber surfaces.
      <br/>
      For example, etching of copper (Cu), platinum (Pt), tantalum (Ta), rhodium (Rh), and titanium (Ti), among others may create electrically conductive etch byproducts.
      <br/>
      Etching these metals presents a problem when using the conventional helicon source reactor.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Conductive deposits on the reactor walls can degrade reactor performance in several ways.
      <br/>
      Conductive deposits on the wall can reduce inductive power transfer to the plasma.
      <br/>
      The ceiling and/or upper portion of the side wall of the reactor chamber typically are made of a non-conductive material, such as quartz or glass, to facilitate the transfer of power from the inductive coil antenna to the plasma.
      <br/>
      A coating formed by the conductive material on the walls and ceiling of the chamber has the effect of attenuating the power coupled to the plasma from the inductive antenna of the helicon source.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      As the interior surface of the chamber under the antenna is coated with a conductive material, eddy currents are produced in the material which attenuates the power coupled to the plasma.
      <br/>
      As the conductive coating builds in thickness over successive processes, the attenuation progressively increases and the power coupling into the plasma progressively decreases.
      <br/>
      Such a reduction in inductive power coupling into the chamber reduces the etch rate and can even cause problems igniting and maintaining a plasma.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The conductive coating also can cause unexpected changes in the characteristics of applied bias power.
      <br/>
      Typically, the lower portion of the reactor walls are made of an electrically conductive material, and are grounded to form an anode of a bias circuit used to control ion energy at the workpiece.
      <br/>
      The characteristics of the bias circuit, which controls ion energy at the workpiece, are important in controlling processing, and are particularly important during etching, as etching is ion driven.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The conductive coating formed on the insulated portion of the chamber walls can electrically connect to the grounded anode portion of the chamber.
      <br/>
      This effectively increases the anode area and results in an unexpected change in the bias power.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The reduction of inductively coupled power and the increase in capacitive bias power have detrimental effects on the etch process.
      <br/>
      The plasma ion density is lowered due to the decrease in inductively coupled power, and the plasma ion energy is increased due to the increase in capacitive bias power.
      <br/>
      As the power levels typically are set prior to the etching process to optimize plasma ion density and energy, any change could have an undesirable impact on etch quality.
      <br/>
      For instance, photoresist selectivity is lowered, etch stop depths are reduced, and ion current/energy distribution and the etch rate are adversely affected.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, unwanted changes in the etch profile may occur even after only two or three workpieces have been etched.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Of course, the decrease in inductively coupled power could be compensated for by increasing the inductive power supplied to the inductive antenna.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the increase in capacitively bias power can be compensated for by decreasing the power supplied to the pedestal.
      <br/>
      Or, the chamber walls could be cleaned more often than would typically be necessary when etching materials producing non-conductive by-products.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      These types of work-arounds, however, are generally impractical.
      <br/>
      A user of a plasma reactor typically prefers to set the respective power levels in accordance with a so-called "recipe" supplied by the reactor's manufacturer.
      <br/>
      Having to deviate from the recipe to compensate for the conductive deposits would be unacceptable to most users.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is believed that the aforementioned detrimental effects will be unpredictable, and therefore, the required changes in the power settings could not be predetermined.
      <br/>
      Thus, unless the user employs some form of monitoring scheme, the required compensating changes in power inputs would be all but impossible for a user to implement.
      <br/>
      Realistically, the only viable solution would be to clean the chamber frequently, perhaps as often as after the completion of each etch operation.
      <br/>
      An increase in the frequency of cleaning, however, would be unacceptable to most users as it would lower throughput rates and increase costs significantly.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Another problem with conventional helicon reactors is that the ratio of the surface area of the anode portion of the wall to the pedestal is too small.
      <br/>
      Since a large portion of the wall must be electrically non-conductive to facilitate inductive power transfer to the plasma, only a small portion of the wall is electrically conductive and may act as the anode for the capacitive bias supplied by an RF power source.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to have the surface area of the pedestal significantly less than that of the grounded portion so that the average voltage (often referred to as the DC bias voltage) at the surface of the workpiece is negative.
      <br/>
      This average negative voltage is employed to draw the positively charged ions from the plasma to the workpiece.
      <br/>
      If, however, the surface area of the pedestal is only slightly smaller than the surface area of the grounded portion, as is typically the case in a conventional inductively coupled plasma etch reactor, the average negative voltage at the surface of the workpiece is relatively small.
      <br/>
      This small average bias voltage results in a weak attracting force which provides a relatively low average ion energy.
      <br/>
      A higher negative bias voltage value than typically can be obtained using a conventional inductively coupled plasma etch reactor is necessary to optimize the plasma ion energy so as to ensure maximum etch rate while not creating significant damage to the workpiece.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the surface area of the grounded portion of the wall would be sufficiently large in comparison with that of the pedestal so as to produce the maximum possible negative average voltage at he surface of the workpiece, i.e. one half the peak to peak voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Yet another drawback associated with the conventional helicon source reactor involves the cooling of the walls of the chamber.
      <br/>
      Most processes typically are only stable and efficient if the chamber temperature is maintained within a narrow range.
      <br/>
      Since the formation of the plasma generates heat which can raise the chamber temperature above the required narrow range, it is desirable to remove heat from the chamber in order to maintain an optimum temperature within the chamber.
      <br/>
      This typically is accomplished by flowing coolant fluid through cooling channels formed within the conductive portion of the chamber wall.
      <br/>
      As it is not easy to form cooling channels within the insulative portion of the chamber walls, air is directed over the exterior of these walls.
      <br/>
      A problem arises in that the electrically insulative materials, such as quartz or ceramic, typically used to form the chamber walls also exhibit a low thermal conductivity.
      <br/>
      Thus, the chamber walls are not ideal for transferring heat from the chamber.
      <br/>
      As a result, the chamber temperature tends to fluctuate more than is desired in the region adjacent the insulative chamber walls because the heat transfer from the chamber is sluggish.
      <br/>
      Often the temperature fluctuations exceed the aforementioned narrow range required for efficient etch processing.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      These excessive temperature fluctuations can cause another problem.
      <br/>
      As discussed previously, deposits will tend to deposit on the chamber walls during the etch process.
      <br/>
      In attempting to control the chamber temperature by air cooling the insulative chamber walls, the chamber wall temperature and the layer of deposits formed on the interior surface thereof, tends to cycle.
      <br/>
      This cycling causes thermal stresses within the layer of the deposited material which result in pieces of the material flaking off the wall and falling into the chamber.
      <br/>
      The loose deposit material can contaminate the workpiece, or it can settle at the bottom of the chamber thereby requiring frequent chamber cleaning.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="17">
      The present invention provides an improved helicon source plasma reactor employing an internal inductive antenna capable of generating a helicon wave for generating a plasma.
      <br/>
      A magnet or magnets disposed around the chamber provide an axial magnetic field to facilitate helicon wave propagation.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      One embodiment of the present invention employs loop type antenna secured within a bell shaped portion of the chamber.
      <br/>
      Although it is possible to employ a single loop type to generate the helicon wave, it is presently preferred that the loop antenna be a double loops type antenna with two rings of magnets surrounding the wall of the bell shaped portion.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Another embodiment employs a flat coil type antenna secured within the chamber.
      <br/>
      A magnet disposed around the chamber provides the axial magnetic field adjacent the coil to facilitate helicon wave propagation.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In the preferred embodiments, the internal antenna of the present invention is constructed to prevent unwanted sputtering of the antenna.
      <br/>
      Although it is possible to form embodiments of the antenna of a non-sputtering conductive material, it is presently preferred to form the antennas of a conductive material surrounded, completely or partially, by a non-sputtering jacket.
      <br/>
      The non-sputtering jacket prevents plasma within the processing chamber from sputtering underlying material into the processing chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In the preferred embodiments, the antenna is coupled to the chamber wall so that heat generated by the antenna is transferred between the jacket and the chamber wall by conduction.
      <br/>
      As such, the antenna may be coupled to the chamber wall, by brazing, screwing, seating, or otherwise bonding, fusing, or mechanically interlocking with it.
      <br/>
      This allows the temperature of the antenna, and in particular the jacket portion of the antenna, to be regulated by regulating the temperature of the chamber wall.
      <br/>
      Regulation of the jacket can help prevent cracking and flaking of the jacket and any deposits on the surface of the jacket.
      <br/>
      This extends the useful life of the antenna and prevents workpiece contamination.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Preferably, the non-sputtering jacket is formed of a material that also is electrically insulative and has low RF power attenuation.
      <br/>
      In such an embodiment, the surface of the antenna exposed to plasma may be segmented to reduce eddy current flow in conductive materials deposited on the surface of the antenna.
      <br/>
      With the coil antenna, the antenna may be segmented radially and/or the individual turns may be separated or segmented.
      <br/>
      With the loop antenna, the entire interior of the bell shaped portion of the chamber may be segmented into circumferential rings and/or arcuate segments, or only the portions adjacent the antenna conductor.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In the preferred embodiment, gaps separate the exposed surface of the antennas so that conductive deposits are inhibited from electrically joining the separated surfaces.
      <br/>
      Typically, the gaps are formed with side walls of sufficient length with respect to gap width to inhibit conductive deposits from joining the segmented surfaces, while inhibiting plasma generation within the gaps.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the gap is about 0.025 to 1 millimeter with the ratio of height to width being greater than about 5.
      <br/>
      As an alternative, or in addition to, the shape of the sidewalls forming the gap may be tailored to inhibit conductive byproduct from joining antenna segments.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the sidewalls step apart near the chamber wall so that the gap forms a "T" shape.
      <br/>
      The gaps may or may not extend all the way to the chamber walls.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In preferred embodiments, the chamber walls are constructed of electrically and thermally conductive material, such as aluminum, or the like, and the voltage potential of the walls may be controlled, such as by fixing the potential at ground.
      <br/>
      It is possible in some embodiments to form the wall of the bell portion of the chamber of glass or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The portion of the conductive chamber walls exposed to plasma may have a coating, to inhibit sputtering of the chamber walls.
      <br/>
      The protective coating or layer prevents sputtering of material from the chamber walls by a plasma formed within the chamber.
      <br/>
      Absent this protective layer, sputtered material from the walls could degrade processing quality and contaminate the workpiece, thereby damaging the devices being formed thereon.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the electrically conductive chamber walls are made of aluminum with a protective layer of aluminum oxide (i.e. anodized aluminum).
      <br/>
      The protective layer, however, could also be a conductive ceramic material, such as for example boron carbide.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to form a magnetic bucket to protect exposed chamber walls, as is known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In some embodiments, an advantage of placing the antenna within the processing chamber is that it allows the size of the electrically conductive portion of the chamber walls, which acts as an anode for the DC bias circuit, to be increased.
      <br/>
      Providing a larger anode allows processing rates to be optimized while not creating significant damage to the workpiece.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In addition, since the chamber walls may be made conductive, any conductive deposits on the chamber walls will not have a detrimental effect on the plasma characteristics.
      <br/>
      For example, there would be no sudden increase in the capacitive coupling of RF power and ion energy caused by an electric coupling of the deposits to the grounded areas of the reactor which act as an anode for the energized workpiece pedestal.
      <br/>
      Thus, in some embodiments, the use of electrically grounded conductive chamber walls in combination with internal inductive antenna ensures, that the plasma characteristic do not change even when the process results in conductive deposits coating the interior walls of the chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Chamber walls made of a conductive metals such as aluminum would also exhibit significantly greater thermal conductivity than that of conventionally employed electrically insulative materials such as quartz or ceramic.
      <br/>
      This results in a quicker transfer of heat from the antenna and the interior of the chamber to coolant fluid flowing through cooling channels formed in the chamber walls.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is easier to maintain a narrow chamber temperature range and avoid the problems of a conventional reactor in connection with the cracking and flaking off of deposits from the chamber walls.
      <br/>
      Additionally, it is easier and less expensive to form cooling channels in aluminum chamber walls than in the conventional quartz walls.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In addition to the above-described advantages of the embodiment having conductive walls, the plasma characteristics may be better controlled by adjusting the amount of RF power supplied to the inductive antenna and the energized pedestal.
      <br/>
      For example, a capacitively coupled plasma can be formed by providing RF power solely to the pedestal (and/or the conductive chamber walls).
      <br/>
      Conversely, a purely inductively coupled plasma can be formed by providing RF power solely to the inductive antenna.
      <br/>
      Or, the reactor can be operated using any desired mix of inductively and capacitively coupled RF power.
      <br/>
      Thus, the reactor can be operated in an inductively coupled mode, capacitively coupled mode, or a combined mode.
      <br/>
      This provides the opportunity to use the reactor to perform a variety of operations over a wide process window.

      Immersing the antennas in plasma allows more efficient coupling of inductive power to the plasma.
      <br/>
      With small internal inductive coils, in addition to orienting the coils perpendicular to a chamber wall, the coils may be oriented along a chamber wall.
      <br/>
      This allows for further improvement of power coupling to the plasma.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1A &amp; 1B, depict some possible orientations of the small inductive coil 100 within the chamber 200.
      <br/>
      Because the coil 100 is within the chamber 200, the coil may be oriented as shown in FIG. 1B to provide yet more efficient coupling of inductive power to the plasma.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1B, the instantaneous magnetic field may be oriented so that both the pole regions 110b' &amp; 110b" are exposed to plasma.
      <br/>
      The pole regions 110b' &amp; 110b" deliver most of the inductive power.
      <br/>
      Therefore, by immersing the inductive antenna 100b in plasma, it is possible to further increase inductive power coupling to the plasma by orienting the antenna so that both poles 110b' &amp; 110b" deliver inductive power to the plasma.

      In a typical application, the plasma reactor may employ several small inductive coils to generate plasma for processing a workpiece.
      <br/>
      In such an embodiment, it is preferred to arrange the coils to provide a uniform plasma at the workpiece.
      <br/>
      With the present invention, the small inductive coils may be utilized to tailor the plasma uniformity inside the chamber by changing the location of the coils, by changing the orientation of the coils, or by changing the power deposition profile within the chamber by adjusting the magnitude and phase relationship of the RF inductive power through each of the individual coil antennas.

      FIGS. 2A-2C are cut away top views showing possible arrangements of small internal inductive coil antennas 300 within the chamber 200.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 2A-2C, the coil antennas are disposed around the center of the chamber 200.
      <br/>
      The small internal inductive coil antennas 300 may be near, or secured to, the top wall or ceiling of the chamber 200.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In FIGS. 2A &amp; 2B, the coil antennas 300 are arranged so that the instantaneous magnetic field polarity 310 faces the center of the chamber 200.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2A, the coil antennas 300 are driven by a power source (not shown), or by multiple power sources, so that the instantaneous magnetic field of adjacent antennas have the opposite polarity facing toward the center of the chamber 200.
      <br/>
      Also in the embodiment of FIG. 2A, opposing antennas have opposite polarity at poles 310 facing toward the center of the chamber 200.
    </p>
    <p num="37">In FIG. 2B, the coil antennas are driven so that the instantaneous magnetic field of adjacent antennas have the same polarity at the poles 310 facing toward the center of the chamber 200, and opposing antennas have the same polarity at the poles 310 facing toward the center of the chamber 200.</p>
    <p num="38">
      In FIG. 2C, the coil antennas 300 are arranged in a circular fashion with the poles 310 facing toward an adjacent antenna.
      <br/>
      As with the embodiments of FIGS. 2A &amp; 2B, the interconnection of the coil antennas 300, and the phase relationship of the source power, may be selected so as to provide a uniform plasma at a workpiece.
      <br/>
      For example, in some applications, the neighboring poles of adjacent antennas may have the opposite polarity.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      It is possible to secure the coil antennas 300, of FIGS. 2A-2C to the side wall or walls of the chamber 220 as illustrated in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In addition, antennas may also be secured to the bottom wall 230 of the chamber 200 as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, any number of antennas 300 may be used to tailor the power distribution within the chamber 200.
      <br/>
      As such, it is possible to optimize plasma uniformity at the workpiece 10 by changing the number of antennas and their location within the chamber 200.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      FIG. 5 illustrates another possible arrangement of coils within the chamber.
      <br/>
      The antennas 300 may be arranged in a spherical dome shape, as is partially depicted in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      In addition to adjusting the location and the phase relationship of the antennas 300, the amplitude of the individual antenna coils also may be adjusted to optimize power deposition within the chamber 200.
      <br/>
      For example, more distal antennas may provide proportionally more power to the plasma than those closer to the pedestal 16.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In addition, the preferred embodiment of the present invention allows for improved control of plasma species densities.
      <br/>
      One way this may be accomplished is by selectively introducing precursor gas in areas of high, or low, power regions within the chamber.
      <br/>
      The power levels of the antennas 300 could be independently adjusted to control the plasma characteristics.
      <br/>
      For example, in the embodiment of FIG. 6, precursor gas or gases may be supplied through gas ports 270 placed near ceiling 240 mounted antennas 300, selected to provide high power, while gas ports 275 provide the same precursor gas or gases near low power sidewall 220 mounted antennas 300.
      <br/>
      Areas of high power may produce more ions, while areas of low power would produce more reactive neutrals.
      <br/>
      The overall characteristic of the plasma, therefore, could be controlled by adjusting the power levels supplied to each of the individual antennas 300.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      It is also possible, to supply different plasma precursor gases into areas of high and low power deposition.
      <br/>
      In such and embodiment, a gas with a high ionization energy could be supplied into a high power region, such as near a pole 310, while plasma precursor gases with lower ionization energy could be introduced in areas of low power.
      <br/>
      For example, with the embodiment of FIGS. 6A &amp; 6B, one precursor gas with high ionization energy may be supplied through gas ports 270 placed near high power ceiling 240 mounted antennas 300, while gas ports 275 provide the a precursor gas with a low ionization energy, near low power sidewall 220 mounted antennas 300.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      An advantage of being capable of supplying different precursor gases to areas of high, or low, power deposition is that it expands the types of precursor gases that may be used to form the plasma.
      <br/>
      As a result, the characteristics of the plasma may be improved to optimize workpiece processing.
      <br/>
      For example, He may be used in place of Ar as a source of ions.
      <br/>
      One advantage of He as compared to Ar is that He cations are less massive than Ar cations.
      <br/>
      The He cations, therefore, are more responsive to the applied workpiece bias.
      <br/>
      As a result, higher processing rates are possible without otherwise causing charge damage to the workpiece.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Yet another advantage of the preferred embodiment of the present invention is that the chamber need not be made of an insulative material.
      <br/>
      The portion of the chamber walls underlying the inductive coil antenna previously had to be made from a non-conductive material, typically quartz or ceramic, to prevent significant attenuation of the magnetic field generated by the external coil.
      <br/>
      With the coil inside the chamber this problem is no longer a consideration.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the chamber walls can be made of conductive materials, such as aluminum.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Making the chamber walls conductive has many desirable effects.
      <br/>
      First, as shown in FIGS. 3-5, the chamber walls 220 &amp; 240 can be electrically grounded and serve as the electrical ground for the RF power supplied through the pedestal 16.
      <br/>
      The surface area of the chamber walls 220 &amp; 240 is significantly greater than previously employed grounded areas.
      <br/>
      In addition, the surface area of the now conductive and grounded chamber walls 220 &amp; 240 will greatly exceed that of the RF energized pedestal 16.
      <br/>
      This will create a larger negative bias voltage, thereby making it feasible to produce a more optimum plasma ion energy and directionality at the surface of the workpiece.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Although FIGS. 3-5 depict chamber walls that are formed of entirely conductive material and grounded, a portion of the walls may be formed of non-conductive material if as desired, or the walls may be set at some other voltage potential, or may be floating if desired.
      <br/>
      An advantage of the present invention, as discussed above, is that limitations on size and placement of non-conductive chamber wall material imposed by an external inductive antenna is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Another advantage of employing conductive chamber walls is that it solves the problem of voltage shift that occurred when the conductive deposits on dielectric walls electrically couple with the grounded areas of the chamber.
      <br/>
      Since the chamber walls 220 &amp; 240 are already conductive and electrically grounded, the deposition of additional conductive material on the interior surface of the walls is irrelevant and has no effect on the bias voltage or the plasma characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Yet another advantage of employing conductive chamber walls 220 &amp; 240 is the enhanced cooling capability such walls can afford.
      <br/>
      For example, chamber walls made of aluminum exhibit a much higher thermal conductivity in comparison to the quartz walls of conventional inductively coupled plasma etch reactors (e.g. 204 W/mK for aluminum compared with 0.8 W/mK for quartz).
      <br/>
      In addition, as cooling channels 216 (shown in FIGS. 7A-8B) are easily formed in aluminum chamber walls 212 and the entire chamber can now be made of aluminum, cooling channels 216 can be distributed throughout the chamber walls.
      <br/>
      This eliminates the need for air cooling the exterior of the chamber walls as was necessary with a conventional inductively coupled RF plasma reactor.
      <br/>
      Flowing coolant through internal cooling channels 212 is a much more efficient method of heat transfer.
      <br/>
      Consequently, heat transfer from the chamber 400 to coolant fluid flowing in the cooling channels 216 formed in the chamber walls 212 is much quicker.
      <br/>
      This increased rate of heat transfer allows for much less variation in the chamber temperature.
      <br/>
      As a result, the chamber temperature can be readily maintained within that narrow range necessary to ensure efficient etch processing and to prevent the cracking and flaking off of contaminating deposits from the chamber walls.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Conductive chamber walls made of metals such as aluminum can, however, have a potential drawback.
      <br/>
      These materials would tend to sputter under some processing conditions.
      <br/>
      The material sputtered off of the walls could contaminate the workpiece and damage the devices being formed thereon.
      <br/>
      This potential problem is prevented by forming a protective coating 45 over the interior surface of the chamber walls, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      This coating 45 is designed to be resistant to the effects of the plasma and so prevents the conductive material from being sputtered into the chamber 200.
      <br/>
      Further, the coating 45 is designed to have an insignificant effect on the electrical and thermal properties exhibited by the walls.
      <br/>
      If the chamber walls are aluminum, it is preferred the interior surface be anodized (i.e. coated with a layer of aluminum oxide).
      <br/>
      The anodized aluminum layer will provide the protective characteristics discussed above.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a conductive ceramic material could be chosen to form, or to coat, the interior walls of the chamber to prevent sputtering and surface reaction on the walls.
      <br/>
      For example, boron carbide would be an appropriate choice.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      A similar sputtering problem exists with the small coil antennas described previously.
      <br/>
      If the coil antennas were formed of a metal, the unwanted sputtering of this metal by the plasma could contaminate the workpiece, and would quickly erode the coil structure.
      <br/>
      To inhibit this, one embodiment has the coils constructed of a non-sputtering conductive material, such as a conductive ceramic like boron carbide.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the coil antennas may be formed with a metal core isolated from the plasma by non-sputtering material.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In one such embodiment, as depicted in FIG. 7A, a metallic coil 412 may be surrounded by a non-sputtering jacket 402.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the non-sputtering jacket 402 also be a poor electrical conductor and a good thermal conductor, such as a ceramic such as aluminum nitride.
      <br/>
      The small antenna 400 may be coupled to the wall 212 of the chamber to form a heat exchange channel or conduit 214, which provides a heat flow path between the antenna 400 and the wall 212.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the heat exchange conduit 214 is created by directly coupling the antenna 400 to the wall 212, such as by brazing the antenna 400 to the wall 212 so that heat generated by the antenna 400 is transferred to the chamber wall 212 by conduction.
      <br/>
      The antenna 400 could also be interlocked with or be otherwise bonded with the wall, such as by screwing, gluing, fusing, or the like, to form the heat exchange conduit.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Coupling the antenna 400 to the wall 212 allows the temperature of the antenna 400 to be regulated by regulating the temperature of the wall 212.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the temperature of the antenna 100 may be regulated by pumping coolant through channels 216 in the reactor wall 212.
      <br/>
      Coupling the antenna 400 to the wall 212 so that it conducts heat to the wall 212 and regulating the temperature of the wall 212 provides a means for regulating the temperature of the antenna 400.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Regulating the temperature of the antenna 400 helps prevent cracking and flaking of the jacket 402 and inhibits cracking and flaking of any contaminating deposits that may accumulate on the surface of the antenna 400.
      <br/>
      Cracking and flaking are typically caused by thermal expansion cycles.
      <br/>
      For example, an unregulated antenna can reach temperatures of 500 degrees centigrade or more and then cool to room temperature.
      <br/>
      This type of temperature cycle can cause any coating or build-up on the surface of the antenna, or the jacket itself, to crack or flake.
      <br/>
      If the antenna is located over or near the workpiece, pieces likely will contaminate the workpiece if the temperature is not regulated.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the jacket and conductor are less likely to separate if the temperature of the antenna is regulated.
      <br/>
      The optimum operating temperature of the antenna is dependent on the type of by-product and the composition of the antenna.
      <br/>
      It easily can be determined empirically and is expected to be about from 100 to 300 degrees centigrade.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      With this embodiment, a good thermal conductor is selected that will transfer heat rapidly so that the antenna 400 does not heat unevenly.
      <br/>
      Uneven heating can cause thermal stresses on the antenna 100 which reduce its reliability.
      <br/>
      As current passes through the conductor coil 412, heat is generated by the conductor which heats the antenna 400.
      <br/>
      Since the antenna is cooled by the wall 212, a temperature gradient may build within the antenna 400.
      <br/>
      By using a good thermal conductor, the temperature gradient within the antenna can be reduced so that the antenna is not subject to thermal stresses sufficient to degrade the antenna 400 or degrade the antenna to wall coupling 214.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the thermal conductivity of the antenna must permit the temperature of the antenna to be optimized, as discussed above, so that the antenna or by-products do not flake, and so that deposition of by-products on the surface of the antenna can be controlled.

      Forming the jacket of a poor electrical conductor provides a means for coupling the conductor coil 412 to the electrically conductive chamber wall 212 without providing a path to ground through the grounded chamber wall 212.
      <br/>
      If the non-sputtering jacket 402 is formed of an electrically conductive ceramic material, such as boron carbide, the jacket 402 could be coupled to the wall 212 via an electrically insulative layer (not shown) formed between the electrically conductive jacket 402 material and the electrically conductive chamber wall 212.
      <br/>
      The thermally conductive layer thus provides the heat exchange conduit formed by the antenna to chamber wall coupling and thereby provides a means for regulating the temperature of the inductive antenna by regulating the temperature of the chamber wall.

      <br/>
      The coil 412 may be wound around a ferrous core 414, as shown in FIG. 7A, to improve magnetic flux properties.

      The antenna 400 may be coupled to the chamber wall 212 by a brazing 214.
      <br/>
      The brazing bond 214 allows heat to exchange between the antenna 400 and the wall 212.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the temperature of the jacket 402 and of the conductor 412 is regulated by pumping coolant through channels 214 in the wall 212.
      <br/>
      Bonding the antenna 400 to the wall 212 by brazing is but one way to form the heat exchange conduit between the antenna and the wall.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment of FIG. 7A, the heat exchange conduit 214 between the antenna 400 and the wall must have sufficient thermal conductivity to allow regulation of the temperature such that thermal expansion cycles of the antenna 400 do not cause cracking or flaking of the antenna 400 or cause decoupling of the antenna-to-wall coupling.

    <p num="58">
      The embodiment of FIG. 7A also employs gaps 422 in surfaces of the antenna exposed to the interior of the chamber 200.
      <br/>
      Separating the exposed surfaces of the antenna reduces eddy currents that can form in conductive deposits (not shown) that form on the surface of the antenna.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Eddy currents in the conductive by-product on the surface of the antenna 400, attenuate the power coupling between the antenna 400 and the plasma.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as a workpiece is processed, the power delivered to the plasma gradually diminishes.
      <br/>
      This affects plasma characteristics such as density and plasma etch rate.
      <br/>
      As workpiece processing necessitates precise control of plasma characteristics, variations in antenna power coupling degrades workpiece processing.

      With the small internal antenna 400, the pole regions 410' &amp; 410" are areas of high power deposition.
      <br/>
      As such, it is possible to form the gaps 422 only near the pole regions 410' &amp; 410" to reduce most of the eddy current losses.

      With this embodiment, the antenna 500 is seated in the chamber wall 222, such as for example using a flange 226, threading, or other known mechanical interlock, so that heat may flow from the jacket 502 of the antenna 500 to the chamber wall 222 at the antenna 500 to wall 222 coupling 224.

      In addition to the advantages described thus far, embodiments of the present invention employing electrically conductive chamber walls allow the reactor to be operated in a capacitively coupled mode, in an inductively coupled mode, or any combination thereof.
      <br/>
      If RF power may be supplied to the pedestal, without also supplying RF power the inductive antennas, the reactor will operate in a capacitively coupled mode.
      <br/>
      This is not possible in a conventional inductively coupled plasma etch reactor due to the previously-described inadequate area ratio between the pedestal and the conductive anode portion.
      <br/>
      The area ratios typically found in conventional inductive reactors produce poor capacitive power coupling which has been found insufficient to generate a plasma within the chamber.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, RF power could be supplied to the inductive antennas without also supplying RF power the pedestal.
      <br/>
      Thus, the reactor would operate in an inductively coupled mode.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Inductive coupling will be more efficient at pressures ranging between about 1 mTorr and 100 mTorr, while capacitive coupling will be more efficient at pressures ranging between about 100 mTorr and 10 Torr.
      <br/>
      Some processes are best performed at lower pressures consistent with inductive coupling, whereas other etch processes are best performed at the higher pressures consistent with capacitive coupling.
      <br/>
      Thus, some embodiments of the reactor constructed in accordance with the present invention have a greater versatility than either a conventional inductively coupled or capacitively coupled plasma etch reactor because it can support processing over much wider pressure ranges.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      Additionally, inductive coupling will generate more ions, while capacitive coupling will produce more reactive neutral species.
      <br/>
      Different processes or process steps often call for more ions or more reactive neutral species, depending on the desired result.
      <br/>
      A reactor constructed according embodiments of the present invention can control the composition of the plasma in ways not possible with conventional inductively coupled or capacitively coupled etch reactors because the amount of RF power inductive and capacitive coupled into the chamber can be readily varied by varying the amount of power supplied to the pedestal and to the collective or individual internal inductive antennas.
      <br/>
      For example, some steps of an etch process can be performed with more inductive coupling to create an ion-rich plasma, while other steps can be performed with more capacitive coupling to create a reactive neutrals-rich plasma.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      Furthermore, in addition to controlling the plasma characteristics by controlling the power deposition of the individual antennas, the inductive antennas need not be the only source employed to sustain the plasma.
      <br/>
      Rather, the plasma can be at least partially sustained via capacitive coupling using the energized pedestal.
      <br/>
      This allows the RF power supplied to the antennas to be tailored to produce the desired species concentrations without regard to the power necessary to sustain the plasma.

      This also places the antenna 8000 beyond any conductive deposit coating of the chamber.
