      <br/>
      In a V-type engine including first and second pistons connected to a common crank pin of a crankshaft through first and second connecting rods, a large end of each of the connecting rods is formed so that its lower surface assumes a substantially horizontal attitude at a most-lowered position of the crank pin.
      <br/>
      This ensures that even if the construction is such that the large ends of the conducting rods do not contact with a defined amount of oil stored in lower portion of a crankcase in the V-type engine, the lower portion of the crankcase can be formed at a small depth, thereby lowering the entire height of the V-type engine.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a V-type engine including a first bank and a second bank which are disposed in a V-shape on opposite sides of a vertical line passing through the center of a crankshaft carried in a crankcase, the banks being formed continuously with the crankcase, and a first piston and a second piston which are fitted in cylinder blocks of the first and second banks, respectively and which are connected to a common crank pin of the crankshaft through first and second connecting rods, respectively.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Desription of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">Such V-type engines are known, as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.61-291734.</p>
    <p num="5">Such V-type engine is effective to suppress the entire height of the engine to a low level, while permitting the number of cylinders to be increased by virtue of the inclined attitude of each of the banks, but if the lower portion of the crankcase can be formed at a small depth, the entire height of the engine can be further lowered.</p>
    <p num="6">
      However, a defined amount of oil corresponding to the capacity of the engine is generally stored in the lower portion of the crankcase.
      <br/>
      For this reason, there is a certain limit to forming the lower portion of the crankcase at a small depth.
      <br/>
      Especially, when it is desired that the surface of the oil does not contact with a large end of the connecting rod in order to eliminate the loss of power due to the agitation of the oil during rotation of the engine, it is further difficult to decrease the depth of the lower portion of the crankcase.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to ensure that the defined amount of oil stored in the lower portion of the crankcase is not agitated by the large end of the connecting rod, thereby preventing the loss of power, and the lower portion of the crankcase can be formed at a small depth, thereby lowering the entire height of the engine and providing a compactness of the engine.</p>
    <p num="8">To achieve the above object, according to a first aspect and feature of the present invention, there is provided a V-type engine including a first bank and a second bank which are disposed in a V-shape on opposite sides of a vertical line passing through the center of a crankshaft carried in a crankcase, said banks being formed continuously with the crankcase, and a first piston and a second piston which are fitted in cylinder blocks of the first and second banks, respectively and which are connected to a common crank pin of a crankshaft through first and second connecting rods, respectively, wherein large ends of the connecting rods, which are connected to the crank pin, are formed so that their lower faces assume a substantially horizontal attitude at a most-lowered position of the crank pin, and a defined amount of oil is stored in a lower portion of the crankcase, so that the oil does not contact with the large ends of the connecting rods.</p>
    <p num="9">
      With the first feature, the large ends of the connecting rods cannot contact with the surface of the oil stored in the lower portion of the crankcase, thereby making it possible to avoid a loss of power due to the agitation of the oil and to contribute to an enhancement in power performance.
      <br/>
      Moreover, when the crank pin is brought into the most-lowered position, the distance between a horizontal plane tangent to the lowermost end points of the large ends of the connecting rods and the center of the crank pin can be minimized, and the lower portion of the crankcase for storing the defined amount of oil can be formed at a corresponding decreased depth, thereby lowering the entire height of the engine and providing a compactness of the engine.
    </p>
    <p num="10">According to a second aspect and feature of the present invention, each of the large ends is comprised of a large end half formed integrally on a connecting rod body and having a semi-circumferential bearing surface conformed to a semi-circumferential surface of the crank pin, and a cap bolted to the large end half and having a semi-circumferential bearing surface conformed to the other semi-circumferential surface of the crank pin, a joint face between the large end half and the cap being formed in parallel to the lower surface of the large end.</p>
    <p num="11">With the second feature, even if the joint face is inclined with respect to an axis of the rod body due to the construction of the large end of the connecting rod, the cap can be maintained in a laterally symmetric shape as in the conventional cap, and the formation and the machining thereof can be achieved easily.</p>
    <p num="12">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiment taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="14">The present invention will now be described by way of an embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring first to FIG. 1, an engine body 1 of a V-type engine is comprised of a crankcase 2, a pair of left and right cylinder blocks 31 and 32 integrally formed in a V-shape at an upper portion of the crankcase 2, and cylinder heads 41 and 42 bonded to upper ends of the cylinder blocks 31 and 32.
      <br/>
      The left cylinder block 31 and cylinder head 41 constitute a first bank B1, and the right cylinder block 32 and cylinder head 42 constitute a second bank B2.
      <br/>
      The banks B1 and B2 are disposed to form an included angle  THETA  of 90 (degree)  therebetween, and a vertical straight line Y passing through the center of a crankshaft 5 carried in the crankcase 2 is a line bisecting the included angle  THETA .
    </p>
    <p num="16">Connecting rods 71 and 72 are connected at smaller ends 7s, 7s thereof through piston pins 101 and 102 to pistons 61 and 62 fitted in the cylinder blocks 31 and 32 of the first and second banks B1 and B2, and at their larger ends 7b, 7b to a common crank pin 5a of the crankshaft 5 (see FIG. 2).</p>
    <p num="17">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a lower portion of the crankcase 2 is formed as an oil reservoir 2a in which a defined amount of oil 11 is stored.
      <br/>
      An oil pump 15 for pumping the oil 11 to supply it to various portions of the engine E is mounted to an inner wall of the crankcase 2 and is driven through a pair of gears 16 and 17 from the crankshaft 5.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, the large ends 7b of each of the connecting rods 71 and 72 is comprised of a large end half 7b1 integrally formed on a connecting rod body 7a and having a semi-circumferential bearing surface 91 conformed to a semi-circumferential surface of the crank pin 5a, a cap 7b2 having a semi-circumferential bearing surface 92 conformed to the other semi-circumferential surface of the crank pin 5a, and a pair of bolts 12, 12 for coupling the larger end half 7b1 and the cap 7b2 to each other.
      <br/>
      The pair of bolts 12, 12 are inserted through bolt bores 13, 13 in opposite ends of the cap 7b2 and threadedly fastened in threaded bores 14, 14 in opposite ends of the larger end half 7b1, respectively, so that the pair of bolts 12, 12 are disposed in parallel to each other with the crank pin 5a interposed therebetween.
      <br/>
      Each of end faces of heads 12a, 12a of the bolts 12, 12 forms a lower face C of the large end 7b.
      <br/>
      The lower face C is formed so that it is parallel to a joint face D between the larger end half 7b1, and the cap 7b2 and substantially horizontal at a most-lowered position of the crank pin 5a.
      <br/>
      To ensure this, in the case of the V-type engine E, the angle  ALPHA  of inclination of the joint face D and the lower face C with respect to an axis A of the connecting rod body 7a is set at approximately 50 (degree) .
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      On the other hand, the oil reservoir has such a capacity provided that even when the oil 11 is accommodated in an amount reaching an upper limit level H, the lower face C of the larger end 7b does not contact with the oil surface.
      <br/>
      Reference character L designates a lowest limit level of the oil 11.
    </p>
    <p num="20">A crank web 5b of the crankshaft 5 is also formed so that it does not contact with the oil 11 in the oil reservoir 2a during rotation of the crankshaft 5.</p>
    <p num="21">The operation of this embodiment will be described below.</p>
    <p num="22">During operation of the engine E, the oil pump 15 driven from the crankshaft 5 pumps the oil 11 in the oil reservoir 2a to supply it to various portions of the engine E and hence, these various portions can be reliably lubricated.</p>
    <p num="23">On the other hand, the large ends 7b of the connecting rods 71 and 72 and the crank web 5b do not contact with the liquid surface of the oil 11 stored in the oil reservoir 2a and hence, it is possible to avoid the loss of power due to the agitation of the oil 11 by the large ends 7b and the crank web 5b, which can contribute to an enhancement in power performance.</p>
    <p num="24">Moreover, the lower face C of the large end 7b of each of the connecting rods 71 and 72 is formed so that it is substantially horizontal at the most-lowered position of the crank pin 5a, and hence, when the crank pin 5a is brought into the most-lowered position, the distance S from a horizontal plane tangent to the lowermost end points of the large ends 7b of the connecting rods 71 and 72 to the center of the crank pin 5a can be minimized, and the oil reservoir 2a having the defined capacity can be provided correspondingly close to the crankshaft 5, i.e., the depth of the lower portion of the crankcase 2 can be decreased, thereby lowering the entire height of the engine and providing a compactness of the engine.</p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 4 shows the V-type engine according to the present invention, to which conventional connecting rods 071 and 072 are assembled with a joint face D between a large end half 07b1 and a cap 07b2 being perpendicular to an axis A of a connecting rod body 07a.
      <br/>
      As can be seen from FIG. 4, in such a case, unless the depth of the lower portion 2a of the crankcase 2 is increased, or the amount of oil 11 stored in the crankcase 2 is decreased, the large ends 07a of the connecting rods 71 and 72 agitate the oil 11 during rotation of the crankshaft 5, thereby bringing about a loss of power.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In addition, according to the present invention, the lower face C of the large end 7b of each of the connecting rods 071 and 072 is formed in parallel to the joint face D between the large end half 7b1 and the cap 7b2 constituting the large end 7b.
      <br/>
      Therefore, even if the joint face D is inclined with respect to the axis A of the connecting rod body 7a as described above, the cap 7b2 can be maintained in a laterally symmetrical shape, as in the conventional common cap and hence, the formation and machining of the cap 7b2 can be easily achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Although the embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail, it will be understood that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and various modifications in design may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention defined in claims.
      <br/>
      For example, the oil reservoir 2a of the crankcase 2 can be replaced by an oil pan.
