    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a thin-film magnetic head for use in a magnetic disk apparatus, a VTR, etc., and a magnetic write/read apparatus equipped with this magnetic head, and more particularly, to a very small thin-film magnetic head which has low recording magnetomotive force necessary for magnetizing a magnetic recording medium, has a fewer number of recording coil turns and has a very narrow track width, and a magnetic write/read apparatus equipped with this magnetic head.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      For an inductive magnetic head which has been conventionally popular, when used both for writing and reading, it is in principle advantageous to increase the number of coil turns because this provides a larger reading output.
      <br/>
      With such a magnetic head used exclusively for information writing, however, the number of coil turns can be reduced as long as the magnetomotive force required for writing is satisfied.
      <br/>
      The inductive magnetic head for exclusive use in information writing, therefore, has a simpler structure than the aforementioned inductive magnetic head designed both for writing and reading, thus facilitating the head fabrication process and improving the production yield.
      <br/>
      The magnetic head for writing only has a further advantage in easier miniaturization of the magnetic core portion and easily ensuring the high efficiency of the head.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It is a magnetic head with a single-turn coil which has the simplest structure and is attractive.
      <br/>
      It is known that the recording current needed to magnetize a magnetic recording medium using a single-turn magnetic head fabricated by the prior art design technology is around 1 A (Ampere), namely, 0.7 to 0.8 A or 1.5 A. (See E. P. Valsyn and L. F. Shew, "Performance of Single-Turn Film Heads," IEEE Trans.
      <br/>
      MAG-9, No. 3, September 1973, and W. Chynoweth, "Small Thin-film Transducers Point to Fast, Dense Storage Systems, Electronics, July 25, pp. 122-127, 1974.)
    </p>
    <p num="7">This means that the magnetomotive force of the conventional single-turn coil magnetic head does not differ from that of the conventional inductive magnetic head designed for writing and reading (several dozens of turns), which is about 1 A * T (Ampere * Turn).</p>
    <p num="8">
      Since the conventional single-turn head or few-turns head requires a recording current larger by a factor of several tens than that of the writing/reading head, the burden on the driver circuit to supply the recording current is very heavy.
      <br/>
      What is more, because of the large current, the heat generated by the coil portion will deteriorate the characteristic and reliability of the head.
      <br/>
      To cope with never stopping improvement of the density of magnetic recording apparatuses, there will be expected demands for further miniaturization of the magnetic core and further reduction of the number of coil turns.
      <br/>
      This therefore requires some design scheme for a low-magnetomotive force magnetic head, which can magnetize a magnetic recording medium with a low magnetomotive force, preferably of several dozens of milliamperes * turns (mA * T), similar to the writing current needed by the conventional inductive write/read magnetic head.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Further, since the thickness of the magnetic pole in the plane facing the recording medium for the conventional inductive magnetic head is on the order of several micrometers ( MU m), the dimensional tolerance of machining for the pole track width has been considered to be limited to around .+- 0 (slashed zero) 5  MU m as long as the state-of-the-art film etching process is used, and it is very difficult to provide a narrow track width of 1  MU m or below.
      <br/>
      A solution to this shortcoming has been craved so far.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide a very small, single-turn or few-turns thin-film magnetic head, which needs considerably lower magnetomotive force for recording than the conventional heads, is excellent in processing precision, and will ensure recording with a very narrow track width of several  MU m or narrower, particularly, 1  MU m or narrower.</p>

    <p num="47">The function of this invention will now be explained on the basis of the design scheme, developed by the present inventors, for a very small thin-film magnetic head with low magnetomotive force and high working precision.</p>
    <p num="48">
      Let us consider a coil having a circular cross section a cylindrical magnetic core that concentrically surrounds this coil, as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      A very narrow magnetic gap is formed in this magnetic core.
      <br/>
      Given that the inner radius of the magnetic core is Rin, the outer radius of the magnetic core is Rout (from which the thickness of the magnetic core is  DELTA R=Rout-Rin), the magnetic gap length is g, the track width of the magnetic core is W, the total magnitude of the recording current that flows across the coil is I (equivalent to magnetomotive force), and the effective magnetic permeability of the magnetic core is  MU , the density of a magnetic flux  PHI  induced on the magnetic core by the current I is expressed by an equation (5) below in approximation.  (Equation image '12' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Thus, an average value Bav of the density of a magnetic flux, induced on the magnetic core by the current I, in the thickness wise direction (radius direction in FIG. 1) of the magnetic core is expressed by the following equation (6); the average value Bav is nearly the same as the average magnetic flux density in the magnetic gap.
      <br/>
      In the equation (6), "Log" is a natural logarithm.  (Equation image '13' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="50">Rewriting the equation (6) yields:  (Equation image '14' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="51">
      Let us consider a simple case where Rout and Rin are made smaller with Rout/Rin being a constant.
      <br/>
      It is understood from the equation (7) that with  MU  being a constant, the magnetomotive force I necessary to obtain a constant Bav decreases in proportion to (Rout-Rin).
      <br/>
      This means that making the magnetic core of the magnetic head properly compact will significantly reduce the recording magnetomotive force.
    </p>
    <p num="52">It is to be emphasized that since the above-described design scheme has not been employed in fabricating the conventional inductive magnetic heads, regardless of bulk heads or thin-film heads, magnetomotive force of above several hundred mA * T (about 1 A * T on an average) is needed conventionally.</p>
    <p num="53">
      FIG. 2 shows the result of computing the relation between the magnetomotive force I necessary for obtaining Bav=1T and the inner circumferential length Lc (=2 PI Rin: the magnetic gap length g disregarded) of the magnetic core as an example, with  ALPHA =Rout/Rin and  MU  taken as parameters, using the equation (7).
      <br/>
      The value of (Rout-Rin) is obtained by ( ALPHA -1)Lc/(2 PI ).
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Referring to FIG. 2, for  ALPHA =1.1 for  MU =200 (value as the specific magnetic permeability), if Lc is reduced to 5  MU m from 1000  MU m, the magnetomotive force I is decreased by a factor of 200 to about 20 mA * T from about 4 A * T. This value, about 20 mA * T, is nearly equal to or smaller than the recording current value needed to magnetize the magnetic recording medium using an ordinary write/read inductive magnetic head with many turns coil.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that the values of (Rout-Rin) respectively corresponding to Lc=1000  MU m and Lc=5  MU m are 15.9  MU m and 0.08  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="55">Even if the value of  MU  (specific magnetic permeability) obtained for Lc=5  MU m is just "50" for some reason, it is apparent that recording can be done with low magnetomotive force that is a quarter of that in the case of the mentioned Lc=1000  MU m, i.e., about 80 mA * T. Apparently, the use of the design scheme expressed in the equation (5) for a small thin-film magnetic head will provide a thin-film magnetic head with considerably low magnetomotive force.</p>
    <p num="56">
      The working precision on the pole track width on the medium opposing face is very important in fabricating a magnetic head.
      <br/>
      Generally speaking, the dimensional tolerance of machining for the pole track width should be set to 1/10 of a predetermined track width or less.
      <br/>
      According to the state-of-the-art thin-film head fabricating process, the dimensional tolerance for the track width of about 5  MU m and the magnetic core thickness of 3 to 4  MU m is about .+- 0 (slashed zero) 5  MU m, which almost satisfies the above condition.
      <br/>
      If the existing semiconductor process technology is adapted properly, the dimensional tolerance for the track width can be reduced approximately by a factor of 10 by reducing the magnetic core thickness by a factor of 10.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      To achieve a very narrow track width of 1  MU m or narrower, therefore, the dimensional tolerance for the pole track width should be set as large as .+- 0 (slashed zero) 1  MU m or smaller, or the magnetic core thickness at least on the medium opposing face should be set to or below 1  MU m. In the case of fabricating a separate write/read type thin-film magnetic head having a lamination structure of a recording head and a reading head like a magneto resistive head, the accuracy of positioning the recording head and the reading head as well as the dimensional tolerance for the pole track width are very concerning matters.
      <br/>
      In this type of recording head, therefore, sufficient write/read characteristics and reading S/N ratio should be attained even in consideration of the dimensional tolerance for the pole track width, the positioning dimensional tolerance, an off-track amount, and so forth in order to achieve a track width of 1  MU m or narrower.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      It is generally necessary to set the effective sum of those dimensional tolerances or errors to 1/10 of the recording track width.
      <br/>
      This requires that the dimensional tolerance for the pole track width be suppressed down to or below 1/10 of the recording track width.
      <br/>
      More specifically, for a track width of 1  MU m or narrower, it is preferable that the dimensional tolerance for the pole track width should be set to .+- 0 (slashed zero) 05  MU m or smaller, or the magnetic core thickness on the medium opposing face should be set to or below 0.5  MU m. In the aforementioned example (Lc=5  MU m), since the magnetic core thickness is 0.08  MU , the dimensional tolerance for the track width is 1/10 thereof, thus ensuring a very narrow track of 1  MU m or narrower.
      <br/>
      It is now apparent that the use of the new design scheme expressed by the equation (7) will provide a thin-film magnetic head with a very narrow track width of 1  MU m or narrower.

    <p num="59">There will now be described a write/read apparatus for accomplishing writing and reading an information using the thin film magnetic head described above.</p>

    <p num="67">
      FIG. 3 is a cross section showing a thin-film magnetic head according to the first embodiment of this invention.
      <br/>
      This thin-film magnetic head is a ring-shaped horizontal (planar) type thin-film magnetic head, which comprises a magnetic layer 1a, an insulating layer 3, a coil 4, a magnetic layer 2a, a magnetic layer 2b and a head protective layer 5 laminated in order on a head substrate 6, with a magnetic gap 7 sandwiched between the magnetic layers 2a and 2b.
    </p>
    <p num="68">Let us put that a magnetic gap depth is D, a magnetic gap length is g, the inner circumferential length (length of the line A-B-C-D) of a magnetic core, which consists of the magnetic layers 1a, 2a and 2b and surrounds the coil 4 is Lc, an average magnetic flux density (unit: T (tesla)) necessary to generate a predetermined recording magnetic field needed to magnetize a magnetic recording medium is Bav, and the effective magnetic permeability of the ring-shaped magnetic core is  MU , as shown in FIG. 3.</p>
    <p num="69">
      As described above, the thin-film magnetic head shown in FIG. 3 are not constituted of a coil having a circular cross section and a cylindrical magnetic core concentrically surrounding this coil.
      <br/>
      By considering the magnetic core of this thin-film magnetic head as a cylindrical magnetic core, however, the recording magnetomotive force I can be calculated approximately.
      <br/>
      That is, if the circumferential length Lc and the magnetic gap depth D are considered as Lc=2 PI  Rin and D=Rout-Rin where Rout and Rin are variables in the equation (7), the magnetomotive force I can be expressed as follows:  (Equation image '17' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="70">where Log is a natural logarithm and variables in this equation are expressed in SI units.</p>
    <p num="71">
      By determining Lc, g and D in such a manner that the recording magnetomotive force I expressed by this equation becomes 0.001 A * T to 0.1 A * T, it is possible to magnetize a magnetic recording medium with magnetomotive force considerably lower than that of the conventional ring-shaped inductive magnetic head.
      <br/>
      It is therefore possible to easily accomplish the reduction in number of the coil turns (including a single turn) and miniaturize the magnetic core with high reliability.
      <br/>
      This design also facilitates the head fabrication and improves the production yield.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to form a magnetic core with a narrow track width of several  MU m or below and accomplish high working precision.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      For example, with Lc=5  MU m, D=0.5  MU m,  MU  (as the specific magnetic permeability)=200 and Bav=1 T, the value of the magnetomotive force I needed to magnetize a magnetic recording medium will be 26 mA * T, which is very low.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this level of magnetomotive force can be well achieved by a single coil turn, which provides a recording current of 26 mA.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      This means that the conventional recording driver circuit can be used, and because of the current being equal to or smaller than that of the conventional head, there hardly is a need to concern the deterioration of the reliability originating from the heat generated by the coil.
      <br/>
      Further, the single-turn design will significantly reduce the inductance of the coil (which is proportional to a square of the number of coil turns), thus ensuring significant widening of the recording frequency band.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Since the thicknesses of the magnetic layers 2a and 2b constituting the magnetic core which is located on the side of the medium opposing face 8 are D (=0.5  MU m), the existing semiconductor process technology can be used to design the track width with the allowance of about .+- 0 (slashed zero) 05  MU m as has already been discussed.
      <br/>
      This facilitates the fabrication of a thin-film magnetic head that ensures a very narrow track of 1  MU m or below.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, due to the simple head structure, the is production yield is very high.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      As long as Lc, D and g are determined using the above-given equation, the other factors, such as the size and shape of the magnetic core, may be changed freely.
      <br/>
      For instance, the thickness of the magnetic layer 1a and those of the magnetic layers 2a and 2b at a given distance away from the magnetic gap portion may be set larger than the magnetic gap depth D. This improves the effective magnetic permeability  MU  of the magnetic core and can thus ensure recording with lower magnetomotive force.

      This thin-film magnetic head has the following advantages besides the same advantages as the thin-film magnetic head of the first embodiment shown in FIG. 3.

      Further, the magnetic resistance of the thin film 15 itself is as low as value as can be negligible as compared with the magnetic resistance of the whole ring-shaped magnetic core.
      <br/>
      Even if the size of the ring-shaped core is reduced in accordance with the reduction in magnetomotive force, therefore, the spatial deformation of the signal magnetization distribution in the magnetic core, caused by the attraction of the signal magnetic flux from the magnetic recording medium by the magnetic core can be reduced, thus preventing the averaged magnetic permeability of the magnetic core from decreasing.
      <br/>
      This means that lower magnetomotive force can easily be accomplished without decreasing the efficiency of the magnetic core when the magnetic core is miniaturized.

      the magnetomotive force I needed to generate the average magnetic flux density Bav nearly equal to the saturation magnetic flux density Bs of the magnetic core in the magnetic gap when the recording current is supplied to the coil, is computed to be 15.7 mA * T (&lt;0.1 A * T) from the equation (1).

      At this time, the intensity of the recording magnetic field in the longitudinal direction of the recording track at the point P on the bottom surface of the longitudinal recording layer directly below the magnetic gap is obtained to be 361,000 A/m (=4530 Oe) from the equation (3).

      It is apparent that this intensity is sufficient to make recording on the recording medium with the aforementioned coercive force.

    <p num="115">Although ten embodiments have been described herein, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that this invention may be embodied in various other specific forms given below.</p>
    <p num="116">
      (1) The coil may be made of a high melting-point metal.
      <br/>
      Tungsten or molybdenum may be used as the high melting-point metal.
      <br/>
      The miniaturization of the magnetic head increases the density of the current flowing across the coil, and causes electromigration and heat generation, so that the coil is easily cut.
      <br/>
      This problem can however be overcome by the use of a high melting-point metal for the coil.
      <br/>
      The surface of the coil made of a high melting-point metal may be oxidized, forming an oxide film of a high melting-point metal.
      <br/>
      This allows a smooth magnetic path to be formed.
      <br/>
      Further, the high melting-point metal coil and the oxide film on the surface of that coil can provide magnetostatic coupling between the upper magnetic layer and the lower magnetic layer, so that the magnetic permeability can be maintained even though fine patterning.
    </p>
    <p num="117">(2) The provision of an antiferromagnetic film 16 at the position as shown in FIGS. 11A to 11C permits the magnetic pole to be securely magnetized, thus reducing noise.</p>
    <p num="118">(3) A dummy projection may be provided at the peripheral portion of a protruding to-be-polished surface at the time of polishing the sliding surface of the magnetic head to increase the area of the to-be-polished portion, thereby improving the depth accuracy.</p>
    <p num="119">As described above, this invention has the following advantages.</p>
    <p num="120">
      (1) Since the magnetomotive force can be made significantly lower than that of the conventional head, it is easy to design the coil to have fewer turns, particularly, a single turn.
      <br/>
      This design simplifies the fabrication process and is excellent in mass production.
    </p>
    <p num="121">(2) As the head becomes very small as compared with the conventional head, a multi-channel structure becomes easier.</p>
    <p num="122">
      (3) Due to the fewer turns, the impedance of the head is reduced considerably.
      <br/>
      The rising time and falling time of the recording current become shorter, thus widening the recording frequency band accordingly.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      (4) As the magnetomotive force and the impedance are reduced considerably, the power needed for recording can also be reduced significantly, thereby overcome the problem of the recording-current originated heat generation at the head portion.
      <br/>
      The reliability of the head is thus improved.
    </p>
    <p num="124">(5) Due to the head size considerably smaller than that of the conventional head, the thickness of the magnetic pole becomes on the sub-micron order (micron order in the prior art), so that the working precision in the thin-film etching process for the track width or the like is significantly improved and the fabrication of a thin-film magnetic head having a very narrow track width of 1  MU m or below becomes significantly easy.</p>
    <p num="125">
      Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details, and representative devices, shown and described herein.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.
