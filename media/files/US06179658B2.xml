    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a sealing arrangement between an electrical connector and an electrical conductor, and in particular to a sealing arrangement between an electrical connector and a substantially flat electrical conductor (such as a flexible print circuit).</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In order to electrically connect a flexible printed circuit (FPC) to another FPC or to an electrical component, it is necessary to secure a electrical connector to the FPC.
      <br/>
      In such an arrangement, the FPC passes through an aperture in the housing of the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      To provide a substantially watertight seal between the FPC and the housing, the housing or part of the housing is moulded around the FPC or the FPC is secured to the housing by hot-melt adhesive.
      <br/>
      These known arrangements have disadvantages in terms of assembly or processing time, and temperature stresses on the FPC.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">It is an object of the present invention to overcome the above mentioned disadvantages.</p>
    <p num="4">A sealing arrangement in accordance with the present invention between an electrical connector and an electrical conductor in which the electrical conductor extends through an aperture in a housing of the electrical connector, the sealing arrangement being positioned adjacent the aperture and comprising a flap member which is pivotally mounted and movable between an open position and a closed position, the flap member being positioned on one side of the electrical conductor; a wall positioned on the opposite side of the electrical conductor to the flap member; and a compressible seal positioned around the electrical conductor; wherein, in the closed position of the flap member, the flap member, the wall and the electrical conductor lie in planes which are substantially parallel; and the seal is compressed between the flap member and the wall and partially extruded into the aperture.</p>
    <p num="5">Compared to previously known arrangements, the present invention provides a sealing arrangement which is quicker and easier to assemble, and which does not subject the electrical connector to temperature stresses.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="7">
      FIGS. 1 to 3 show a first embodiment of sealing arrangement 10, in accordance with the present invention, between an electrical connector 12 and an electrical conductor 14.
      <br/>
      The electrical conductor 14 is a flexible printed circuit (FPC).
      <br/>
      The electrical connector 12 is a female electrical connector and comprises a housing 16 with an aperture 18.
      <br/>
      The FPC 14 passes through the aperture 18 and is electrically connected with one or more terminals (not shown) positioned inside the housing 16.
      <br/>
      The sealing arrangement 10 comprises a wall 20 integral with the housing 16 and which extends away from one side of the aperture 18; a flap member 22 pivotally attached to the housing on the other side of the aperture; and a compressible seal 24 which substantially surrounds the FPC 14 adjacent the aperture.
      <br/>
