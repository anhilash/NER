    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">Our invention relates to single phase aqueous surfactant-free nontoxic air freshening compositions and wick-containing air freshening devices using such compositions.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Conventional liquid air fresheners generally comprise a reservoir containing a mixture which may be a true solution, a colloidal solution or a microemulsion of a perfume with a solvent into which dips a wick which is connected to an emanating surface.
      <br/>
      The perfume mixture travels up the wick to the emanating surface from which the perfume evaporates and freshens the surrounding atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Perfumes used in those air fresheners are generally oils and are therefore generally insoluble in water in the absence of any other agents.
      <br/>
      Systems in which the perfume solution is aqueous based therefore always contain a surface active agent which solubilizes the perfume in water.
      <br/>
      The amount of surfactant has to be quite high, for instance, 10-15% or more by weight based on the total composition.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The surfactants used in such compositions are conventional surfactants, generally anionic surfactants such as alkyl benzene sulfonates and lauryl sulfates.
      <br/>
      Nonionic surfactants have also been used, but they are more expensive and tend to depress the perception of the perfume odor.
      <br/>
      These surface active agents are all nonvolatile, and they therefore do not evaporate from the emanating surface.
      <br/>
      The concentration of surfactant in the emanating surface therefore gradually increases, and the presence of surfactant impedes the progress of perfume in the wick and also prevents the perfume emanating as it should.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Most aqueous based systems also contain a cosolvent in addition to the perfume and surfactant.
      <br/>
      Examples of cosolvents are ethanol and diethylene glycol monoethyl ethers (DEGMEE).
      <br/>
      Such compositions always contain a surfactant and therefore suffer the same disadvantages as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Some liquid air fresheners contain little or no water and so are free of surfactant.
      <br/>
      For example, a solution of perfume in DEGMEE having the structure:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      and water is stable as a single phase provided the amount of water is low, for example, below 20% when the amount of perfume is about 10% by weight.
      <br/>
      Since these compositions cannot tolerate high amounts of water, they tend to be expensive.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,945,950 (incorporated by reference herein) describes solid air freshener compositions, which suffer from different problems to the air fresheners comprising liquid compositions with which our invention is concerned.
      <br/>
      The solid compositions contain perfume, a diethylene glycol monoalkyl ether and a gelling agent, which is a surface active fatty acid soap or metal salt thereof and an inert liquid.
      <br/>
      Water is sometimes included in the compositions as some or all of the inert liquid, but only in small amounts of 4% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,081 issued on May 5, 1987 (the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein), it is indicated that diethylene glycol monobutyl ether (DEGMBE) having the structure:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="9">
      can, when containing dissolved perfume, incorporate a surprisingly large amount of water compared to other glycol ethers and is therefore more cost effective.
      <br/>
      It is further indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,081 that the mixture of DEGMBE and water also has very suitable volatility properties and has a beneficial effect on the rate of emanation of the perfume.
      <br/>
      It is further indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,081 that the composition containing the DEGMBE generally comprises between 5 and 30% by weight of perfume; usually between 8 and 20% by weight of perfume and often 10% by weight.
      <br/>
      It is further indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,081 that the amounts of perfume in compositions containing DEGMBE affect the amount of water that can be mixed into the solution before a phase separation occurs.
      <br/>
      It is stated that, for example, when the concentration of perfume in the solution is 10% by weight then the maximum amount of water that can be incorporated in a one phase solution is about 55% by weight, and for a perfume solution at 20% concentration, the maximum amount of water is about 40% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      It is further indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,081 that the perfume may be any of the perfiumes conventionally used in air fresheners and that "the identity of the perfume makes little difference to the behavior of the solvent system.
      <br/>
      It is further indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,081:
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      "Solutions of perfume in various glycol ethers of varying concentration were loaded with water until phase separation occurred.
      <br/>
      The maximum amounts of water tolerated in systems at various perfume concentrations for the glycol ethers tested is shown in Table 1.

    <heading>THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">
      Our invention is directed to a single phase aqueous surface-active agent-free air freshening composition characterized in that it is (a) nontoxic; (b) nonmutagenic; and (c) environmentally friendly, consisting essentially of:
      <br/>
      (i) 30-70 weight percent water;
      <br/>
      (ii) 5-20 weight percent of a fragrance composition wherein at least 60% of its composition consists of one or more substances having a C log10 P &lt;= 2.5 and no more than 40% of any of the components of the perfume composition has a C log10 P in the range of 2.5&lt;C log10 P &lt;= 7.5; and
      <br/>
      (iii) 30-60 weight percent of a mixture of two glycol ether compounds, one of which is dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether having the structure:  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)
      <br/>
      and the other of which is a compound defined according to the structure:  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)
      <br/>
      wherein R is n-propyl or n-butyl.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The n-octanol/water partitioning coefficient of a perfume material indicated by the term "P" is the ratio between its equilibrium concentrations in n-octanol and in water.
      <br/>
      The perfume materials used in our invention have an n-octanol/water partitioning coefficient "P" of between about 1 and about 107.5 with at least 60% of the perfume components having a partitioning coefficient of between about 1 and about 102.5. Since the partitioning coefficients of the perfume compositions of this invention have values of between about 1 and about 107.5, they are more conveniently given in the form of their logarithm to the base 10, log10 P. Thus, the perfume materials useful in the practice of our invention have a log10 P of between about 1 and about 7.5 as indicated, supra, wherein 60% of the components of the perfume composition have a log10 P of between about 1 and about 2.5 as indicated, supra.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The log10 P of many perfume ingredients have been reported; for example, the Pomona 92 database, available from Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc. (Daylight CIS), Irvine, Calif., contains many, along with citations to the original literature.
      <br/>
      However, the log10 P values are most conveniently calculated by the "CLOGP" program, also available from Daylight CIS.
      <br/>
      This program also lists experimental log10 P values when they are available in the Pomona 92 database.
      <br/>
      The "calculated log10 P" is determined by the fragment approach of Hansch and Leo (Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, Volume 4, C. Hansch, P. G. Sammens, J. B. Taylor and C. A. Ramsden, Editors, page 295,Pergamon Press, 1990,incorporated by reference herein).
      <br/>
      The fragment approach is based on the chemical structure of each component of the perfume material and takes into account the numbers and types of atoms, the atom connectivity and chemical bonding.
      <br/>
      The calculated log10 P values, which are the most reliable and widely used estimates for this physicochemical property, are preferably used instead of the experimental log10 P values in the selection of perfume materials useful in the practice of our invention.

    <p num="24">More specifically, the perfume materials useful in the practice of our invention having a C log10 P &lt;= 2.5 are as follows:</p>
