      The present invention 10 discloses a device for securing the shoelaces 28 on shoes 18.
      <br/>
      The device 10 comprises an outer cylinder 12 being open on one end having apertures 14 positioned in the longitudinal walls thereof for receiving an inner member 16.
      <br/>
      The inner member 16 is also cylindrically shaped having apertures 14 passing therethrough with a head 36 on one end.
      <br/>
      The apparatus functions by positioning the inner member 16 on the inside of the outer cylinder 12 whereby the apertures 14 are aligned and thereafter threading the shoelace 28 through the aperture 14 of the outer cylinder 12 and the inner member 16.
      <br/>
      Thereafter a spring 38 placed longitudinally in the bottom 40 of the outer cylinder 12 communicating with the bottom of the outer cylinder and the tip 42 of the inner member 16 biases outwardly the inner member 16 so as to bind the shoestrings 28 between the apertures 14 of the outer cylinder 12 and the apertures 14 of the inner member 16 thereby securing the shoestrings 28.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates generally to shoes and, more specifically, to a device which is placed on the shoe which will prevent the shoelaces from untying and unthreading.
      <br/>
      The device is comprised of an outer cylindrical member having a plurality of oppositely opposed apertures in the wall and a second cylindrical member having an outside diameter substantially equal to the inside diameter of the outer member.
      <br/>
      The inside cylindrical member also has a plurality of oppositely opposed apertures in the wall.
      <br/>
      The inner cylindrical member is under constant spring pressure toward the open end of the outer member.
      <br/>
      After the shoelaces are threaded through the shoelace eyelets the device is positioned for use.
      <br/>
      The inner member is depressed until its apertures are in alignment with the outer member the end of the shoelace is then passed through both members.
      <br/>
      When both end of the shoelace have been passed through the device the inner member is release and the shoelaces are held by the spring pressure between the two cylindrical members.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The normal method of securing shoelaces by creating a double knot does not insure that the shoelaces will not become untied.
      <br/>
      But does work well in many instances, often too well.
      <br/>
      In sporting events there is an increased force placed on the shoelaces which can create a knot which is extremely difficult to undo.
      <br/>
      This can prove to be especially difficult when dealing with small children.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In sporting events and active children the single knot invariably comes untied.
      <br/>
      Therefore it is felt that a need exists for a device which will grip the shoelaces in a selective position and maintain said position even in active play.
      <br/>
      It is also felt that such a device should be easy to use.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention discloser a device for securing the shoelaces on shoes.
      <br/>
      The device comprises an outer cylinder being open on one end having apertures positioned in the longitudinal walls thereof for an inner member.
      <br/>
      The inner member is also cylindrically shaped having apertures passing therethrough with a head on one end.

    <p num="21">
      Turning to FIG. 1, therein is shown an illustrative view of various situations where an untied shoelace can be hazardous to an individual, such as sporting events and a constant chore for parents to continuously keep an eye on children while they are playing.
      <br/>
      Small children have a tendency to ignore untied shoelaces because they don't perceive any danger and haven't learned to tie them, so it is easy to ignore them rather than to stop play.
      <br/>
      Shown therein is the present invention generally shown at 10 having an outer cylindrical member 12 having apertures 14 therein along with an inner cylindrical member 16.
      <br/>
      Also shown therein is an untied shoe 18 and strings 26, a person 20 who has tripped over his shoes with untied shoestrings 26, a child 22 having his untied shoestrings 26 tied by all adult along with an athlete 24 also having untied shoestrings 26.
