    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      It is known that electrical signals carried by connectors, or adjacent apparatus, may be subject to electromagnetic interference as the result of induced signals picked up from the radiation of adjacent electrical equipment.
      <br/>
      Such interference results from leads acting as an antenna that senses stray electromagnetic radiation; accordingly, the sensing of stray signals in this manner is known as the "Antenna-effect".
      <br/>
      Various efforts have been made to avoid or suppress the result of the antenna-effect, but such efforts have been found to be inconvenient and/or expensive to implement, or both.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      For example, it has been found in the past that antenna-effect stray signals can be avoided by encapsulating leads in sheaths of magnetic-shielding sheet material, or by determining the strength of nearby stray signal fields and then moving all such nearby sources to a physical distance from the leads that has been calculated to prevent the possibility of undesired signals being picked up by electromagnetic induction.
      <br/>
      It can be seen, readily, that such preventive methods and techniques are indeed costly and inconvenient.
      <br/>
      Other attempts to reduce or avoid antenna-effect stray signals have involved the use of ferrite cores.
      <br/>
      However, until now such uses have required additional circuit elements, such as insertion of a jumper cable, having a permanently included ferrite core, in series with the main conductors in the circuit; or, awkwardly and inconveniently surrounding one or more of the circuit conductors with separately applied ferrite cores.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      It is established practice, in industries that make use of thermocouple sensors, to couple the sensor into a related electrical circuit by means of an electrical connector.
      <br/>
      When for example thermocouples are connected to instruments such as panel meters, controllers and transmitters, the input signal from the sensor or transducer usually travels substantial distances along fine gauge electrically conductive wire leads.
      <br/>
      The length and nature of such leads and the environment in which they must function often create conditions that favour occurrence of the antenna-effect.
      <br/>
      In many cases, the leads or signal wires from a sensor or thermocouple are first attached, for convenience, to an electrical connector, for coupling to an instrument or the like.
      <br/>
      As soon as the conductors of the connector are electrically coupled to the circuit, a potential antenna is created.
      <br/>
      Of particular importance are thermocouple connectors which are particularly susceptible to the antenna-effect because of the long lead conductive path of the conductors themselves and the high input impedance of the instrumentation.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The term "ferrite", as commonly understood in the electronics field, denotes a particulate material having one or more oxides of iron in particulate form in a carrier such as a plastics material.
      <br/>
      This usage of the term "ferrite" is to be distinguished from the usual dictionary definition which is a generic name for a number of oxides of iron.
      <br/>
      In this specification, the term "ferrite" is to be understood as including within its scope any suitable material having an absorption and/or shielding effect as concerns electromagnetic waves which may be emitted at or adjacent to a zone of completion of an electrical circuit.
      <br/>
      Known ferrite elements consist of ferrite material sintered into a convenient shape.
      <br/>
      Other known "ferrite" materials for the suppression of electromagnetic interference are nickel-zinc compositions and manganese-zinc materials, of different compositions to permit selection of an optimum type for a given application; pressed parts, components, and powders are known.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="42">
      Referring now more specifically to the drawing, FIG. 1 may be seen to illustrate a device including a ferrite element in accordance with this invention in which the connector device 10 comprises a housing 12 of insulating (e.g. ferrite composition) material having a first separable housing portion 14 and a second separable housing portion 16 that are configured to engage each other about a common separation plane 18 that extends in substantially parallel, co-planar relationship with a contact-element supporting face 20 on first housing portion 14.
      <br/>
      A pair of contact elements 30 are mounted on the housing, although it is considered obvious that just one or substantially more than two contact elements may be mounted to the housing if desired.
      <br/>
      Similarly, although the contact elements 30 shown in FIG. 1 are of the type commonly identified as male contact elements, it is considered obvious that other types of contact elements, such as the female contacts shown and described elsewhere in this specification, may be used in lieu of the male contacts, without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, one of contact elements 30 includes near one end a male end portion 32, and the other contact element includes near a corresponding end, a female contact receptacle portion 33.
      <br/>
      Both the male and female contact portions 32 and 33 are adapted electrically and mechanically to engage a mating external conductor (not shown) in any obvious and well-known manner; in this case, it is apparent that the mating external conductors would be a mating female contact element for male contact portion 32 and a male contact element for female contact portion 33.
      <br/>
      External conductors having these conventional shapes, will electrically and mechanically engage male contact portion 32 and female contact portion 33 in a manner well known to those having skill in the electrical connector art.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Each electrical contact element 30 further includes, at the opposite end remote from the male and female contact portions shown, a screw terminal 34 for electrically coupling the contact 30 to a second external conductor (not shown).
      <br/>
      For this purpose, the second external conductor may have any suitable form, such as flexible insulated electrical wire, that is suitable for coupling to, i.e. electrically and mechanically engaging, screw terminal 34, so as to establish an electrical path extending through and away from connector 10, via contact 30 and the external conductor.
      <br/>
      Contact 30, and any external conductors to which it is coupled, together form an electrical path extending through and away from the housing 12.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The two separable portions 14 and 16 of housing 12 are secured together by any convenient fastening means, such as one or more fastening screws 35 and mating threaded bores 38.
      <br/>
      Portions 14 and 16 preferably are secured together after screw terminals 34 have engaged one or more external conductors to contact element or elements 30, so as to provide a cover for each screw terminal connection and to form a unified connector housing 12.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Housing portion 14 includes a conductor guide groove 40 that serves to constrain and to guide an external conductor from screw terminal 34, out of and away from housing 12.
      <br/>
      Along the portion of the path represented by the groove 40, a first part 44 of a toroidal ferrite core element 42 (shown in FIG. 2) is secured to holding portion 14, as by gluing, force-fitting, molding or any other suitable means, into the electrically insulating material of the housing.
      <br/>
      The second part 46 of ferrite core element 42 is secured to housing portion 16 in any similarly convenient manner, in position to mate with first part 44 so as to form a complete toroidal structure, having a conductor passage 48 extending there through as shown in FIG. 2, when housing portions 14 and 16 are fastened together as by fastening screws 35.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The ferrite core members 42 illustrated in FIG. 2a and 2b are intended to illustrate the characteristic toroidal and cylindrical shape of such cores.
      <br/>
      In this particular embodiment, the core 42 or 42a is divided into two halves, 44,46 or 44a, 46a which together form respectively a complete toroid or cylinder shape.
      <br/>
      The end faces 50,52 and 54,56 of the core halves 44,46 may be provided, as shown in FIG. 2a, with mating projections 58, and receptacles 60, to help align and maintain the relative positions of the two halves when they are brought together in mating relationship.
      <br/>
      The division of core 42 into two halves 44,46 accommodates the particular design and uses of the connector illustrated in FIG. 1, but it should be understood that other ferrite element configurations can be used in connectors constructed in accordance with this invention, including unitary one-piece elements as illustrated respectively in FIGS. 3a and 3b. A conductor passage here shown as passage 48, is to accommodate a portion of the axial length of a conductive path along which electrical signals will be transmitted.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      In the connector device embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3b, the axial length dimension X, of the ferrite element 42', is shown to be comparatively short relative to the diameter of the conductor passage 48.
      <br/>
      It should be recognised, however that dimension X may be increased by any desired amount, so that the shape of element 42 or 42' may eventually more nearly represent a tube as in FIG. 3a, rather than a doughnut-shaped torus.
      <br/>
      For the purpose and uses of this invention, both tubular and toroidal shapes may be used, and either shape may be either unitary as shown in FIGS. 3a and 3b, or divided into separable sections as suggested in FIGS. 2a and 2b.
    </p>
    <p num="48">Although the terms "toroid" and "cylindrical" have been used in this description with reference to FIGS. 2a and 2b and 3a and 3b it will be understood that other enclosing bodies may be used having a regular or irregular curved or polygonal cross-section, and that the nature of the cross-section may change along the length of the enclosing body.</p>
    <p num="49">
      FIG. 4 illustrates, for purpose of completeness, an electrical connector device assembly having a pair of male contact members 132 extending from a two piece housing 114 in which a unitary ferrite element 142, of the type illustrated in FIGS. 3a or 3b, is enclosed when the two parts of the housing are brought together and secured by one or more fasteners such as screw 138, in the manner described above with reference to the connector of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In this connector, one or more external conductors such as wire leads may be separably fastened to the ends of contact members 132 within the housing in the same or any similar manner described with reference to the connector in FIG. 1, so that such external conductors may be passed through the conductor passage 148 of element 142 and extended outwardly from housing 114 via an exit passage 62 corresponding generally to exit passage 40 of FIG. 1.

      FIG. 5 illustrates an electrical connector device 70 including a ferrite element in accordance with this invention pre-assembled to a thermocouple 72 by means of a pair of elongated wire leads 74 that may be made, typically, from dissimilar metal.
      <br/>
      It is known that dissimilar conductive leads in this configuration will heighten the antenna-effect pickup of stray electromagnetic signals.
      <br/>
      A connector permanently attached to the ends of such leads remote from the thermocouple device, accordingly will be found to be especially effective in eliminating the effects caused by such stray signals.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In this embodiment of the invention, the housing 214 supports a pair of electrical contact members having male contact portions 232 extending from the housing.
      <br/>
      Wire leads 74 are coupled to the electrical contacts of male portions 232 within the housing 214, and they extend outwardly from the housing after passing through an embedded ferrite element 242 within the housing.
      <br/>
      As explained previously in connection with the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1, any number of associated conductors such as wire leads may be made to pass outwardly away from the housing through an appropriately-sized internally-positioned element 242.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      FIG. 6 illustrates a two-part mating electrical connector device assembly 310 having a female half 313 and a male half 315, each having one or more wire leads 374 extending outwardly and away from their respective housing members 317 and 319.
      <br/>
      Female connector portion 313 includes a pair of electrical contacts having female receptacle portions 333 mounted to the housing and male connector portions 315 includes a pair of electrical contacts having male contact portions 332.
      <br/>
      The contacts may be mounted to the housing in any known manner as previously described, and wire leads or other suitable forms of external conductors may be electrically coupled to the electrical contacts within the housing, also in any known manner.
      <br/>
      In connector housing half 313 the tubular-shaped female receptacle portions 333 are each surrounded by ferrite elements 342 which may be either toroidal or tubular in shape.
      <br/>
      The elements 342 are made to surround the female portions 33 by extending their tubular bodies through a conductor passage 348 in each element 342.
      <br/>
      It can be seen readily that this structure affords the advantage of immediately and effectively surrounding an axial portion of the length of the continuous electrical flow path that is formed when the male contact portions 332 are mated with the female contacts 333 in accordance with customary electrical connector usage.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In FIG. 7, a plurality of female connector devices 413 which may be similar or identical to connector halves 313 shown in FIG. 6, are mounted in substantially parallel, side-by-side array in a panel member 411.
      <br/>
      In the manner of the connector halves 313 shown in FIG. 6, each unit 413 includes a pair (or any desired number) of female contact portions 433, each surrounded by a ferrite element 442 having a central passage 448.
      <br/>
      This figure is intended to illustrate how a connector in accordance with this invention may be mounted for convenient use in multiple array.
      <br/>
      Suitable conductive leads may be internally connected to contact portions 433 and allowed to extend outwardly away from connectors 313 in a rearward direction.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of clarity it is noted that the rearward direction extends beneath the plane of this drawing and the wire conductors, therefore, are not shown.
      <br/>
      When the connectors 413 are mounted in this manner in a supporting panel 411, they may be used readily and conveniently to couple with any suitable form of external conductor that can be inserted and/or withdrawn from the axial central openings XX within female contact portions 433.

    <p num="54">
      In the embodiment of this invention illustrated in FIG. 8, a connector device 510 having a housing 512, with first and second separable portions 514 and 516, and a pair of male contact members 532 mounted thereto, further includes an externally mounted ferrite element 525 supported on the exterior of housing 512 by means of a support bracket 543 coupled to housing portion 514.
      <br/>
      It will be understood, however, that bracket 543 can be mounted readily to either housing half 514 or 516, within the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      The bracket 543 may be made of metal or plastic, although plastic is preferable to preserve the conductive symmetry of the element so as to optimise the capture of stray electromagnetic signals.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      FIG. 9 illustrates the connector of FIG. 8 in which external conductors 574 in the form of lead wires extending away from the connector housing 514 have been looped through the externally mounted element 525 so that they pass through the conductor passage 548 in the element at least twice instead of merely once.
      <br/>
      It has been determined that this looped configuration can provide enhanced antenna-effect signal absorption when desired.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      FIG. 10 illustrates an alternate form of construction for the connector device of FIGS. 8 and 9, in which an externally mounted element 648 is supported by a bracket 643 that is separately attached to the exterior of the connector housing 612.
      <br/>
      The means of attachment may be known separable mounting means such as, for example, a pair of screws 638, that are threadedly engaged to threaded bores 38 first described herein with reference to FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In this regard, it should be noted that a bracket 643 with an element 648 may be mounted, if desired, to the connector housing illustrated in FIG. 1, using the same fastening screws 35 (as shown in FIG. 1) to secure the bracket to the housing and to secure together the separable housing parts 14 and 16.

    <p num="57">
      FIGS. 11 and 12 illustrate embodiments in accordance with this invention in the form commonly identified in the electrical connector industry as terminal strips.
      <br/>
      The terminal strip connector 710 of FIG. 11 comprises a housing 712 of insulating material having a plurality of parallel spaced-apart barrier walls 780 extending from a contact supporting surface 720 on one side of the strip.
      <br/>
      In each space 782 between adjacent barrier walls 780, a metallic contact XX of generally known design and function is mounted on or in surface 720, in whole or in part.
      <br/>
      Each such contact XX may have for example, a screw terminal 734 threadedly engaged to the conductive material of the contact for separately securing an external conductor, such as a wire lead, electrically and mechanically to the strip; when a separate wire lead is connected to the screw terminals at each end of a contact strip XX, a continuous electrical path is established from one external conductor to the other through the contact strip XX and extending outwardly and away from the terminal strip in two directions.
      <br/>
      It will be understood, of course, that electricity will be assumed to flow, according to convention, primarily in one direction through the path thus established.
      <br/>
      In accordance with this invention, in each space 782, an element 742 having a conductor passage 748 is mounted to the body 712 of terminal strip connector 710, so that the corresponding contact strip XX extends through the conductor passage 748 with the screw terminal portions 734 at opposite ends of the contact XX being positioned on axially opposite sides of the ferrite element 742.
      <br/>
      In this manner it will be understood readily by those having skill in this art, that the continuous electrical path extending though the contact element XX will also extend through a ferrite element 742, thus providing an improved terminal connector strip in which each connected wire lead will benefit from the antenna-effect suppression of the core without requiring any additional structure or additional serially connected wire leads.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      FIG. 12 illustrates a modified form of a terminal strip connector device 810, in which the housing member 812 further includes a separable cover portion 814 that is configured to be separably retained between pairs of adjacent, spaced-apart barrier walls 880 in any convenient manner, such as interference fit or inter-engaging projections and retention shoulders (not shown) of well-known design.
      <br/>
      A ferrite element divided into two parts 844 and 846 is positioned with part of the element in the housing body 812 and the other part in the cover member 814, such that when the cover is engaged to the housing, the element parts 844, 846 will come together in alignment to form a complete element surrounding a corresponding contact element 830.
      <br/>
      This configuration may be particularly advantageous when it is necessary and desirable to provide enlarged (in diameter or in length or both) elements to surround paths that may be especially susceptible to stray electromagnetic signals of an undesired nature.

      Referring to FIG. 35, there is shown a form of connector which includes additionally a signal indicating and/or modification means.

      The connector has a main body portion 3001 and a removable cover portion 3002 which can be secured onto the main body portion 3001 in any convenient manner, for example, by screws 3003 engaging into threaded holes 3004.
      <br/>
      The body 3001-3002 is composed wholly or mainly of ferrite material.
      <br/>
      Both the main body portion 3001 and the cover portion 3002 may additionally have a coating, or sheath, 3005 which may a decorative or protective against physical shocks, or may give an indication of information concerning the nature of the connector or its contents, or any combination of these three functions.
      <br/>
      For example, it may be a metal sheath with stripes, dots, embossing, or figures or lettering.
    </p>
    <p num="86">The main body portion 3001 carries two metal tags or pins 3006 for insertion into appropriate receptor sockets of for example an instrument or a panel.</p>
    <p num="87">
      Within the main body portion 3001 there is a recess which houses a signal indicating and/or modification or modulation means 3007 having at one of its ends two metal terminals 3008 which are attached by screws to the inner end of the respective tag or pin 3006.
      <br/>
      At its other end, the signal indicating and/or modification or modulating means 3007 has openings to receive respective wires 3009 of a pair of wires of dissimilar metals, for example of a thermocouple pair.
      <br/>
      These wires are securable in the signal indicating and/or modification or modulation means 3007 by respective screws 3010.
      <br/>
      It will be seen that, when the cover portion is secured in position on the main body portion, the connections between the wires 3009 and the signal modification means 3007, and the connections between the signal indicating and/or modification means 3007 and the tags or pins 3006, are all entirely or substantially entirely contained within, and shielded by, the ferrite material of the connector body.
    </p>
    <p num="88">Whilst the connector has been shown with two tags or pins 3006, and two wires 3009, it will be apparent to those skilled in the connector art that three or more such items may be used in such a connector.</p>

      By way of example, the signal indicating and/or modification or modulation or filtering or amplifying means 3007 may be a filter, a printed circuit, an etched circuit, a microchip, or means such as a light for indicating variation of, or passage of, an electric current, or any combination of these functions.
      <br/>
      Clearly, it would be possible to have two or more of the means 3007 arranged and connected in series within the connector, and different such means 3007 may be applied for each or some of a plurality of wires such as 3009.
    </p>
    <p num="90">The means 3007 may be a signal booster for a cable such as an undersea cable.</p>

      <br/>
      Such connector means may have its means 3007 arranged to be actuated at a threshold current, and they may be disposed advantageously in a cluster or array with same or different thresholds.
    </p>
    <p num="92">To obtain the greatest possible useful effect from the presence of the ferrite material, it is advantageous if the mating surfaces of any portions of the ferrite body shall be as free as possible from projections or cavities therein which might prejudice the acting of the ferrite body electrically as a single whole, e.g. it is preferred to make such mating surfaces with a mirror-finish.</p>
    <p num="93">
      The ferrite body portions or the shell housings of the connectors may advantageously be made by machining or by molding e.g. in a similar manner to the conventional molding of ceramic bodies.
      <br/>
      It will be apparent to those skilled in the electrical connector art that male plugs, female sockets, connector tabs, and wires, may all be incorporated directly into a molded body at the time of molding of the body, thereby to eliminate the need for separable portions of the ferrite body, for assembly screws or bolts, and for screws or bolts for connection of the wires.
