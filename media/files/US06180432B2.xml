    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">The invention relates to a highly efficient, single semiconductor absorption layer, radiated energy conversion device in which there is also provision for accommodation for performance degradation resulting from exposure to external radiation.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND RELATION TO THE PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="4">
      In the conversion of radiated energy to electrical energy, it has been the practice in the art to use solid state semiconductor layer structures that can produce hole-electron pairs that result from atomic particles or photons, in passing through the semiconductor, engaging in primary or secondary collisions with the semiconductor material.
      <br/>
      The oppositely charged hole-electron pairs are extracted from the absorber and into external circuitry as a signal before they can recombine or be trapped in the semiconductor material.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The environment in which the conversion device is to be used also has a major influence in the design.
      <br/>
      Use in the atmosphere, nominally Air Mass 1.5 (AM1.5), usually takes place at room temperature in light with a moderate ultra violet (UV) content and minimal other energy radiation.
      <br/>
      Structural weight is of less concern.
      <br/>
      Use beyond the atmosphere, in Air Mass 0 (AM0), involves a larger range of temperatures, structural weight is a serious consideration, the radiated energy, usually sunlight is intense with a larger UV content and operation is often in the presence of significant external energy radiation.
      <br/>
      Structures for AM0 operation frequently have features designed to "harden" or slow down deteriorating effects of external radiation on the performance of the conversion device.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The single absorption layer type of radiated energy to electrical energy conversion device has the advantages of essentially unlimited breadth of device area and relative simplicity in structural features and in fabrication.
      <br/>
      There are however, in such a device, interrelated structural features that both produce and extract the electrical energy together with reflective mechanisms that operate to get more than one pass out of the radiated energy in hole-electron pair production that, heretofore in the art, required tradeoffs that had a limiting effect on efficiency and made control of radiation damage more difficult.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Among the influencing factors in the design of single absorption member radiated energy to electrical energy conversion structures are: the absorption lengths of the incident radiated energy in the semiconductor material, the compatibility of any radiated energy enhancement features with the extraction of the electrical energy, the attenuation of the radiated energy by the contacting structure and the compatibility of the overall conversion device structure with manufacturing capability.</p>
    <p num="8">
      There has been activity in the art directed to single absorption member semiconductor radiated energy to electrical energy converters.
      <br/>
      In U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,286,306; 5,342,455; 5,401,330; and 5,419,783 conversion devices are described wherein structural features that are placed in the absorber region of the absorption member for one purpose, interfere with or add complexity, with respect to another purpose.
      <br/>
      There is a need in the single absorption member art for a radiation conversion device that can provide high efficiency achieved with structural and manufacturing simplicity.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      A radiated energy to electrical energy conversion device and technology is provided where there is a single absorber layer of semiconductor material in a single absorption member that has a unique combination of interdependent features.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the absorber layer is much less than had been appreciated heretofore in the art as being useful, and makes possible the use of lower quality semiconductor material.
      <br/>
      Between opposing faces the absorber layer is about 1/2 or less of the carrier diffusion length of the semiconductor material.
      <br/>
      The opposing faces of the absorber layer of semiconductor material are each completely covered by a high electrical conductivity, low radiated energy attenuation, electrical conduction layer that extends to an edge of the device for an electrical contact.
      <br/>
      There is a charge producing carrier separation mechanism in the absorber layer between the conduction layers.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the absorber layer is selected for maximum electrical signal extraction efficiency and may also be selected to accommodate diffusion length damage over time by external radiation.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The radiated energy to electrical energy conversion device is also provided with an incident radiated energy enhancement and support structure positioned on the conduction layer on the incident radiated energy receiving face of the absorber layer and with a radiated energy internal reflection mechanism positioned on the face of the absorber layer away from the incident radiation that returns the energy that passed through the absorber for extra absorbtion.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      In accordance with the invention it has been found that the efficient absorption of incident radiated energy in a single absorber layer semiconductor device is influenced by a greater number of interrelated factors in different ranges than had been appreciated and employed heretofore in the art.
      <br/>
      It had heretofore been accepted that since the radiated energy contains a distribution of photon/particles with different energy content, in order to extract a practical amount of energy, it was desirable to have an absorber that had a thickness approaching the full carrier diffusion length.
      <br/>
      However, the closer to the diffusion length assumed to be needed for thickness, the higher will be the required quality of the semiconductor material.
      <br/>
      In contrast, in accordance with the invention it has been found that most of the absorption takes place essentially adjacent to the incident radiated energy entrant surface, that in such a thin region there is greater tolerance for semiconductor material defects, that there is a limit to the amount of electrical energy that is extractable in the practical sense, that additional absorber layer thickness distance beyond that which is needed for maximum electrical extraction produces deleterious effects including heat, and that structural elements producing energy reflection in the absorption member should be outside the charge extraction portion.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1 there is shown the features of the single absorber layer radiated energy to electrical energy conversion device of the invention.
      <br/>
      The conversion device of the invention has, along the path of the incident radiated energy, a structural capability before the incident energy entrant face that is devoted to maximizing the entrant energy; there is a limited thickness, semiconductor absorber layer arranged for maximum collision event capture with full charge extraction of the resulting charge; and, there is a back reflection and scattering mechanism positioned beyond the absorber layer.
      <br/>
      For clarity the absorber layer will be described first.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Referring to FIG. 1 the incident radiated energy 1 is absorbed in a radiated energy to electrical energy conversion device 2 that has an absorber layer 3 of semiconductor material between faces 4 and 5.
      <br/>
      Covering all of each of faces 4 and 5 and extending to the edge are thin, up to about one third the thickness 10 of the absorber 3, high electrical conductivity conduction layers 6 and 7 each having a very low attenuation of the radiated energy that passes through.
      <br/>
      There is an external electrical contact to each of conduction layers 6 and 7 for transferring the extracted charge to integrating external circuitry, symbolically depicted as external contact elements 8 and 9.
      <br/>
      The absorber layer 3 is of a selected, crystalline, amorphous, polycrystalline or organic, semiconductor material with a bandgap in the range for absorbtion of the energy photon/particle distribution in the incident energy.
      <br/>
      Thickness 10 of the material of the absorber 3 is related to the diffusion length or distance a carrier produced by a collision event will travel during carrier lifetime.
      <br/>
      In accordance with this invention the layer 3 will have a thickness dimension 10 that is in the range of 0.02 to 0.5 of a micrometer for the types of materials with an acceptable bandgap.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      It should be noted that the semiconductor material used heretofore in the art has been of the type known as high quality in which there are minimum carrier traps that could prevent a hole-electron pair formed in the semiconductor material as a result of a photon/particle collision from contributing to an output signal and that to have high quality, single crystal epitaxially grown material is usually needed.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the structure of the absorber 3 in this invention is such that every collision produced carrier is within a fraction of its diffusion length from a conduction layer so that there is a substantial relaxation of any need for high quality semiconductor material.
    </p>
    <p num="15">In the absorber layer 3 a mechanism is provided that separates positively and negatively charged carriers produced by the incident radiated energy photon/particle collision events in the semiconductor absorber layer 3 and produces a sweeping field that moves the carriers to the conduction layers 6 and 7.</p>
    <p num="16">In FIG. 2 there is shown a semiconductor energy band diagram that illustrates the type of shift of the relationship of the Fermi level Ef with respect to the valence band edge Ev and the conduction band edge Ec that will produce the carrier separation mechanism and the resulting sweeping field.</p>
    <p num="17">
      In the energy band diagram of FIG. 2 a p region and an n region meet at a transition 11 with respect to the Fermi level defined by dashed lines, the separation of which varies under different structural arrangements.
      <br/>
      For example where there is a p and an n region meeting at a p n junction the separation could be as small as about 20 Angstroms) ( Angstrom ) whereas with an intrinsic region with a thin p layer or i-p junction formed at one conduction layer and a thin n layer or i-n junction at the other conduction layer, the separation could be essentially the absorber layer thickness 10.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The carriers, majority and minority, resulting from a collision event in the absorber layer 3 produce a significant signal that has only a few nanosecond duration.</p>
    <p num="19">Referring to FIG. 3 an example output signal, developed between terminals 8 and 9 of FIG. 1, is illustrated; and in connection with FIGS. 1 and 2; the signals from all the collision events occurring in the absorber layer 3 are swept into the conduction layers 6 and 7 for sensing at terminals 8 and 9 and integrated into a steady state DC signal in, standard in the art external circuitry, not shown.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The semiconductor material of the absorber layer 3 has a bandgap related to the spectral distribution of the photons/particles in the incident energy.
      <br/>
      If the bandgap is too large, too little energy will be absorbed.
      <br/>
      If the bandgap is too small, the maximum available output voltage will be too small.
      <br/>
      In a single absorption member conversion device of the type of this invention, the output voltage cannot be larger than the bandgap.
      <br/>
      Where the spectral distribution is of the order of that from the sun, which would be radiation essentially equivalent to that from a 6000 degree Kelvin(K) black body, an optimum bandgap would be in about the range of 1.4 to 1.5 electron volts (Ev); whereas where the spectral distribution is of the order of that from an ordinary heating element; which would be radiation essentially equivalent to that from a 2000 degree Kelvin(K) black body, an optimum bandgap would be in about the range of 0.4 to 0.7 electron volts (Ev).
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The semiconductor absorber layer 3 thickness 10 also takes into consideration an absorption distance through which the incident energy must pass in order that the desired photon/particles will be absorbed.
      <br/>
      Since the photon/particle energy distribution is not linear the absorption distance will not be not linear.
    </p>
    <p num="22">In accordance with this single absorber layer radiated energy to electrical energy invention the major portion of the absorption takes place within a very short absorption distance and efficiency is greatest where the absorption distance thickness, element 10 of FIG. 1, of the layer 3 is, that at which maximum electrical charge extraction takes place; which in turn is in a range up to about 1/2 the distance a carrier will travel in the semiconductor material during the carrier lifetime.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The thickness 10 of the absorber layer 3 may be viewed as being influenced by opposing constraints and a selection will be a tradeoff.
      <br/>
      The layer must be thick enough for absorption, but in general, any semiconductor material in which radiated energy can be absorbed, but from which electrical energy extraction cannot occur, should be kept to a minimum as it reduces efficiency.
      <br/>
      However, even though some added thickness beyond that for which charge can be fully extracted with the amount of sweeping field that can be applied or obtained in a practical sense does not add much to the output; some additional thickness may still may be useful under some conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The carrier extraction sweeping field can be achieved as described in connection with FIG. 2 by the effect of hole-electron separation in the structure.
      <br/>

      As an illustration of the reasoning involved in the thickness dimension tradeoff, for both GaAs and InP at 1 micrometer thickness about 95% of the AM0 power that will be absorbed by that material is in fact, absorbed.
      <br/>
      Where there is an increase in the thickness to 10 micrometers, there is an added 1% to 2% of the absorbed power but this small percentage gain is outweighed by the added electrical losses because even if perfect, GaAs and InP will still have diffusion lengths of 3 micrometers.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In the opposite direction of the tradeoff, going in the thinner direction, for InP at a thickness of 0.1 micrometer 64% of the total accessible power is absorbed, and for GaAs it is 60% for the same thickness.
      <br/>
      In other words in this invention over half the available power is absorbed in the first 0.1 micrometer of thickness 10 along the incident energy path through the entrant face 4.
      <br/>
      The absorbed power roughly doubles between an 0.02 micrometer thickness 10 and a 0.1 micrometer thickness 10 for both examples GaAs and InP.
      <br/>
      Correspondingly, if the electrical extraction efficiency from 0.1 micrometer of material is more than half as efficient as it is from 0.02 micrometer of material there would be a gain in total power output by the increase in thickness.
      <br/>
      The gain however, decreases at greater thicknesses so that the tradeoff becomes more demanding.
      <br/>
      For example, for InP the power absorbed changes from 64% to 98% as the thickness 10 changes from 0.1 micrometer to 1 micrometer.
      <br/>
      In the design tradeoff this thickness increase is worthwhile only if the electrical efficiency for power extraction for 1 micrometer is more than 65% of that for 0.1 micrometer.
      <br/>
      For the example InP, this constraint is met initially, but in an AM0 type application after exposure to 1016 1 Mev electrons/cm2 of radiation, the carrier diffusion length will then have deteriorated to 0.5 micrometer, so that having a thicker layer would no longer be effective as an improvement.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In accordance with the invention the design considerations of the absorber layer 3 material and thickness 10 in the structure of the device 2 provides a new ability to accommodate the deterioration of a conversion device resulting from use in the presence of extensive external radiation such as occurs in AM0 conditions.
      <br/>
      The effect of that external radiation is to reduce the diffusion length.
    </p>
    <p num="32">In table 2 the diffusion length of the materials Si, GaAs and InP is shown for radiation exposure per 1 MeV electrons/cm2.</p>

    <p num="34">
      Heretofore in the art in addition to the use of higher band gap materials, the principal approach to reducing the deterioration from external radiation has been to provide shielding or hardening in order to prevent the external radiation from getting into the moderately doped portions of the structure.
      <br/>
      In this invention, essentially the only moderately doped region in the absorber 3 is in the charge separation mechanism.
      <br/>
      That region is very small, in fact it may be as small as the p-n transition region 11 of FIG. 2 which may, on a very abrupt p-n junction, be of the order of 20  Angstrom  across.
      <br/>
      The conversion device of this invention can operate effectively on very small diffusion lengths.
      <br/>
      This capability can provide an accommodation for substantial external radiation while the conversion structure still retains useful operability and efficiency.
      <br/>
      This feature of the structure of the invention is highly valuable in heavy radiation applications because at the 0.02 to 0.5 micrometer thicknesses of the invention electrical efficiency losses due to carrier diffusion length do not become important until much more massive degradation of the semiconductor material than has been sen heretofore in the art has occurred.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      As an illustration, a state of the art device of InP or GaAs material would ordinarily have an absorption thickness of about the diffusion length or about 3 micrometers and would provide about a 20% efficiency.
      <br/>
      In contrast, in accordance with this invention, if such a device, using GaAs or InP as the semiconductor material and being equipped with an absorber layer 3 of the invention with a thickness 10 of only 0.1 micrometer, will still provide an efficiency of about 10%.
      <br/>
      If such a device were to have InP as the semiconductor material and equipped with an absorber layer 3 of the invention with a thickness 10 of about 0.02 micrometer, will still provide an efficiency of about 5%.
      <br/>
      In both cases it is assumed the diffusion length is greater than 0.3 micrometers.
      <br/>
      Thus the structure of the invention will be more tolerant of lower quality semiconductor material and will have a much longer useful lifetime, under conditions were diffusion length is reduced under radiation, than has been seen heretofore in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Were an external bias to be applied between terminals 8 and 9 full charge extraction over a greater distance would be possible but that bias could not be so large as to produce junction break down.</p>
    <p num="37">It is to be noted that; in the structure of this invention, with there being an absorber layer only between 0.02 and 0.5 micrometers thick, and that layer being completely covered on both faces 4 and 5 with high conductivity signal extraction material conduction layer 6 and 7; an electrical extraction capability is provided in which any carrier resulting from any hole electron pair radiated energy collision event in the absorber layer 3 needs at most a small portion of it's diffusion length in travel to reach the contacting layers 4 and 5.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The materials suitable for the absorber layer 3 are semiconductors with a high enough band gap that thermally generated current does not significantly affect performance and that matches the power spectrum of the radiated energy being absorbed.
      <br/>
      The absorber layer 3 is produced in a thickness 10 range from about 0.02 to 0.5 micrometer and will require further processing for a support member 12 and energy entrant efficiency element 13 on one surface and an energy reflection mechanism 14 on the other surface.
      <br/>
      The absorber layer 3 can be grown using the Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) technique standard in the art, provides very good control of layers in the desired thickness range and very reproducible devices.
      <br/>
      The growth process involves the use of vapor phase chemicals such as phosphine for the anion source and tri-methyl indium for the cation source.
      <br/>
      The gasses are passed over a hot substrate in a range of from 600 to 750 degrees C. where they react to form the compound desired.
      <br/>
      Growth rates of 10 to 200 nanometers per minute at a pressure of 0.1 to 1 atmosphere, with an inlet ratio of V/III of about 10 to 500, may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The structure of the invention, being based on a design principle where improved output is achieved from material considered to be of poor quality, the design will also improve efficiency in cases where the material is of poor quality for reasons different from radiation damage.
      <br/>
      For instance where the growth operation takes place on a lattice mismatched substrate, such as GaAs on sapphire or InP on Si, which leads to material with a substantial density of misfit dislocations, and a correspondingly small carrier diffusion length.
      <br/>
      While this situation would impact the efficiency of a device that required the full diffusion length the structure of this invention would be minimally affected if at all.

      Among the approaches for use of the thin layer after its removal from the substrate, the most convenient is to metallize the free surface employing a grid pattern for light transmission, bond the metallized surface to a transparent substrate, remove the original substrate by etching the sacrificial layer, metallize the back surface which is now exposed using a transparent metal with a rough surface followed by a highly reflective metal.
      <br/>
      As another approach the free surface could be coated with a transparent metal with a rough surface followed by a highly reflective metal then bond to a substrate that does not need to transmit light for example metal, then remove the original substrate by etching the sacrificial layer followed by metallization using a grid for light transmission.
      <br/>
      Both approaches now have a single exposed surface to which another substrate can be bonded.

      The absorber layer 3 is grown on a sacrificial, etch responsive layer, on a substrate.

      <br/>
      The sacrificial layer and substrate are then removed by etching thereby exposing the face 5.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the conduction layer 7 is applied on the face 5 followed by the reflection mechanism 14.

      As examples; for GaAs a sacrificial layer of AlGaAs grown on a GaAs substrate would be used with an HF etchant; for InP a sacrificial layer of InGaAs grown in a InP substrate would be used with an HCl etchant.

      The absorber layer 3 with conduction layers 6 and 7 can also be used as one independent absorbtion member in a serial incident radiation path device, that may have many other absorbtion layers.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Returning to FIG. 1, the incident radiation 1 is in a form that has been concentrated as is standard in the art.
      <br/>
      The conversion device has an element 12 positioned between, a standard in the art, antireflection coating 13 and the conductive layer 6.
      <br/>
      The element 12 provides support for the thin device structure, and can be a glass cover or a transparent oxide of silicon or sapphire of the order of about 200 micrometers in thickness to which the up to 1/2 micrometer thickness absorber may be attached or grown.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Further in FIG. 1, beyond the conductive layer 7 of the absorber 2, in the incident radiation path, there is provided a reflection mechanism 14 for providing multiple passes through the absorber of the radiated energy.
      <br/>
      The reflection mechanism 14 includes a highly reflective coating 15, such as silver, positioned on a transparent oxide or metal layer 16 that is about 2.0 micrometers in thickness and with a roughened reflection capability depicted as element 17 such as would be produced by sputtering or by laser ablation and positioned between the layer 16 and the highly reflective coating 15.
      <br/>
      In operation in the reflection mechanism, the highly reflective coating 15 returns most of the energy back into the absorber for continued absorption passes.
      <br/>
      The roughened reflection capability 17 further causes many angular internal reflection energy passes that operate as energy trapping.
      <br/>
      Overall the reflection mechanism adds a 50% increment to the efficiency.

    <p num="45">In FIG. 4 an embodiment of the principles of the invention is shown that accommodates substantial radiation damage thus exhibiting a much longer useful lifetime than has been sen heretofore in the art for use under similar intense radiation conditions.</p>
    <p num="46">
      Under AM0 condition there is a region known as the Van Allen belt that is around 3200 kilometers above the earth where the radiation exposure is so intense that a conventional radiated energy to electrical energy converter would only have a useful life of the order of days.
      <br/>
      The radiation level in the Van Allen belt heretofore has caused the powering of communication satelites by radiated energy conversion to be confined to altitudes above the earth of about 700 kilometers in order for the converters to have a practical useful lifetime.
      <br/>
      However, at such a low altitude there would be required three times as many satellites as would be needed if it were possible to have a radiated energy to electrical energy converter that had an acceptable useful lifetime that would operate in the Van Allen belt.
      <br/>
      Through the principles of the invention the embodiment of FIG. 4 provides a radiated energy to electrical energy conversion device that has a useful life of a decade in the radiation intensity of the type encountered in the Van Allen belt.
    </p>
    <p num="47">The semiconductor material of the absorber is InP, which although it has been used heretofore in radiated energy to electrical energy conversion devices, with this invention a slower diffusion length deterioration in the presence of intense radiation property is of advantage.</p>
    <p num="48">
      Referring to FIG. 4, where the same reference numerals as used in earlier figures are used where appropriate, the incident radiated energy, which for this AM0 application is solar photon energy, is labeled element 1 and is incident over the area of an antireflection layer 13 that in turn is on a glass support layer 12.
      <br/>
      The device 2 is made up of a an absorber layer 3 of Indium Phosphide (InP) on which there is a first conduction layer 6 on a first face 4 and there is a second conduction layer 7 on a second face 5.
      <br/>
      The conductive layer 6 being in contact with the support layer 12.
      <br/>
      The absorber 3 is made up of a high conductivity, doped to about 1 * 1020 per cm3, n+ layer 3A that is about 100  Angstrom  thick, separated from a high conductivity, doped to about 1 * 1020 per cm3 p+ layer 3B that is about 100  Angstrom  thick, by an essentially intrinsic low conductivity layer 3C, that is doped to about 1 * 1013 per cm2 p- and that is in the range of from about 1000  Angstrom  to about 2800  Angstrom  thick that serves the function of the region 11 of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Together the layers 3A, 3B and 3C provide the charge separation mechanism of the device.
      <br/>
      In contact with the conduction layer 7 is a photon reflecting and trapping mechanism 14 made up of a transparent metal or oxide 16, such as SnO or InSnO, the back side of which is abraded and is depicted as roughened element 17, then covered by a highly reflecting metal layer 15, such as Ag.
      <br/>
      The overall combined thickness of layers 3A, 3B and 3C corresponding to dimension 10 of FIG. 1 is designed when built at the beginning of life (BOL) to be within the range of 0.02 to 0.5 micrometers which in turn is between 1/3 and 1/2 of the diffusion length that will occur after exposure in orbit to the expected radiation for the duration to the time of the projected end of the life (EOL) of the conversion device.
      <br/>
      For example assuming a goal to be survival of the conversion device in 1017 1 Mev electrons/cm2 radiation until the diffusion length deteriorates to 1/2 the value in table 2, or 0.15 micrometers for InP.
      <br/>
      It will be apparent that design at BOL will be initially such that there will be a tradeoff of significant energy lost through the absorber film at BOL that is offset by extended EOL.
