      An optical disc drive produces read gate signals for controlling the address and data read timing, and write gate signals for controlling the timing of data writing.
      <br/>
      During the disc speed is stable, the read gate signals and write gate signals are formed using the clock signal generated by an internal oscillator.
      <br/>
      However, when the disc speed becomes unstable, the read gates and write gates are formed using the clock signal generated by the signal reproduced from the disc.

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an optical disc apparatus for recording and reproducing information to and from an optical disc; to a timing signal generator for generating a timing signal required for recording and reproducing information in an optical disc drive according to the present invention; and to an information recording and reproducing method for recording and reproducing information to and from an optical disc.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">Optical discs are widely used today as a high capacity information storage medium, and continue to be developed and marketed for use with computer storage peripherals and audio-visual recording.</p>
    <p num="5">
      An optical disc typically has a spiral track formed on the disc surface.
      <br/>
      Information is recorded and reproduced to and from the disc by means of a laser beam tracking and emitting a light spot to this track.
      <br/>
      The track is also typically divided into a plurality of sectors, which are the smallest units for recording and reproducing data on the disc.
    </p>
    <p num="6">FIG. 17 shows a typical example of a sector structure on a rewritable optical disc.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Each sector 1701 starts with a header area 1702 to which a signal containing address information is prerecorded by means of pits and lands in the optical disc surface.
      <br/>
      Though not shown in the figure, the header area 1702 may begin with a pattern of long marks, known as the sector mark, to make sector indexing easier using a pattern matching technique.
      <br/>
      The sector mark is used on, for example, rewritable optical discs conforming to the ISO/IEC 10090 standard.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the header area 1702 may start with a repeating pattern of a specific period, known as a Variable Frequency Oscillator (VFO), for faster clock reproduction.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      An optical disc drive typically manages the location of each data unit based on the address information in the header area 1702.
      <br/>
      It does this by indexing to a particular sector by detecting the sector mark pattern at the beginning of the header area 1702, or detecting a signal presence based on the envelope, and then reading the address information from the header area 1702.
      <br/>
      This also makes it possible to search and access data quickly and easily.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A gap 1703, data recording area 1704, and buffer area 1705 following the header area 1702 in succession.
      <br/>
      The gap 1703 is used, for example, for controlling the laser power for data recording and reproducing, and no data is recorded.
      <br/>
      The data recording area 1704 is where user data is actually recorded.
      <br/>
      Digital user data is recorded by adding an error correction code or other redundant checking code, and the modulating the digital data according to specific modulation rules for recording.
      <br/>
      The buffer area 1705 is provided as a means of absorbing variations in the rotational velocity of the disc, and has no signals recorded thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Various methods are used for determining the sector arrangement, including constant linear velocity (CLV), constant angular velocity (CAV), an improved CAV method known as zoned CAV (ZCAV), and an improved CLV method known as zoned CLV (ZCLV).</p>
    <p num="11">
      In the CLV method, the disc motor is controlled so that the rotational velocity of the disc is inversely proportional to the disc radius, and the linear velocity of the recording and reproducing track (the "data track" below) is constant at any radial position on the disc.
      <br/>
      Disc storage capacity can thus be increased, and data can be recorded and reproduced synchronized to a constant clock.
      <br/>
      An advantage of the CLV method, therefore, is that substantially the same recording and reproducing conditions can be used at all track positions from the inside to the outside circumference of the disc.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the CAV method, the disc motor speed and the recording/reproducing frequency remain constant.
      <br/>
      Rotational control is therefore simple, and a small motor can be used.
      <br/>
      The drawback to this method is that the total storage capacity of the disc is reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The ZCAV method was developed to address the problem of low overall storage capacity while retaining the simple rotational control of the CAV method.
      <br/>
      In zoned CAV the disc speed remains constant, as in the CAV method, but the optical disc is divided radially into a plurality of zones, each containing a specific number of tracks.
      <br/>
      The recording/reproducing frequency is then changed in each zone from the inside circumference to the outside circumference of the disc.
      <br/>
      Storage capacity approaching that of CLV discs can thus be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The ZCLV method addresses the greater complexity of motor control required for CLV control.
      <br/>
      That is, the recording/reproducing frequency is kept constant, the disc is divided into a plurality of zones similarly to the CAV method, and the angular velocity of the disc is decreased in each zone from the inside circumference to the outside circumference of the disc.
      <br/>
      Storage capacity therefore remains comparable to that of the CLV method while disc motor control is simplified compared with CLV control.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Various methods of deriving a reference clock have been proposed for rewritable optical disc formats.
      <br/>
      These include a so-called sample servo method in which pits are preformed at a constant interval in a zigzag pattern centered on the track center, and these "clock pits" are detected to generate a reference clock for data recording and reproducing.
      <br/>
      Another method is to form a "wobble groove", an undulating sine wave shaped groove, centered on the track center, and reproduce a wobble signal recorded to this wobble groove to generate the reference clock for data recording and reproducing.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The period of the undulations in the wobble groove is normally sufficiently longer than the channel bit period of the recorded data, and is typically an integer multiple of the channel pit period.
      <br/>
      This improves the frequency divisibility of the data reproduction signal with the wobble signal, and makes it relatively simple to derive a reference clock.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      A wobble groove can be used together with a sector structure, as shown in FIG. 17, having a header area in which address information is recorded by preformed pits.
      <br/>
      A land and groove recording method whereby address information is recorded using pits in the header area, a wobble groove is formed in the data recording area, and user data is recorded using both the groove and areas between adjacent grooves ("lands"), has been recently proposed.
      <br/>
      This land and groove method is currently used as a recording method for recent high density rewritable optical discs in combination with the above-described ZCLV control method.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      To record and reproduce data using an optical disc with a sector structure as described above, common optical disc drives typically generate gate signals, such as a write gate and read gate, and use the timing derived from these gate signals to determine the beginning and end of data recording and reproducing.
      <br/>
      Such conventional drives further comprise a counter for counting the reference clock, and determine the gate signal timing based on the generated count.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      With the ZCLV control method described above, however, there is a certain delay required for the disc motor to settle to the specific speed when searching between zones because the angular velocity of the disc changes from zone to zone.
      <br/>
      This means that when timing is based on a reference clock, data recording and reproducing cannot start until the disc motor stabilizes at a rotational speed corresponding to the reference clock.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Furthermore, it is also necessary to change the frequency of the clock used as the reference for recording and reproducing when the optical disc drive starts up, and when searching across zones, when using a ZCAV optical disc because the recording/reproducing frequency differs from zone to zone.</p>
    <p num="21">The time required for the optical disc drive to start up, and the time required for disc searches, is thus increased (slowed) when using ZCLV optical discs and when using ZCAV optical discs.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="36">The preferred embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to the accompanying figures.</p>
    <p num="37">
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an optical disc drive according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 1, this optical disc drive comprises a disc motor 102 for driving an optical disc 101 at a specific angular velocity.
      <br/>
      An optical head 103 comprising a semiconductor laser, optics, photodetector, and other components not shown in the figures is driven for recording and reproducing data to and from the optical disc 101.
      <br/>
      Data recording and reproducing are accomplished by the optics of the optical head 103 concentrating a laser beam emitted from the semiconductor laser to focus a light spot on the recording surface of the optical disc 101.
      <br/>
      Light reflected back from the recording surface is again collected by the optics and converted to electrical current by a photodetector.
      <br/>
      This current is then voltage converted and amplified by an amplifier 104 to derive and output a reproduction signal.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      A servo means 105 controls disc motor 102 rotation, movement of the optical head 103 radially to the optical disc 101, focusing the light spot on the recording surface, and tracking control to keep the light spot focused on the track center.
      <br/>
      Note that focusing control and tracking control use a focusing error signal and tracking error signal, respectively, contained in the reproduction signal output from the amplifier 104.
      <br/>
      The focusing error signal is an electrical signal indicative of the deviation of the light spot from the recording surface of the optical disc 101.
      <br/>
      The tracking error signal is an electrical signal indicative of the deviation of the light spot from a specific track of the optical disc 101.
    </p>
    <p num="39">A reproduction signal processor 106 extracts the signal component recorded to the optical disc 101 from the reproduction signal, digitizes the extracted signal, and reproduces a read clock and read data synchronized to the read clock from the digitized data and reference clock by means of an internal phase-locked loop (PLL).</p>
    <p num="40">The laser driver 108 generates a laser drive signal so that the semiconductor laser built in to the optical head 103 emits at a read power level when reproducing address information and user data from the disc, and emits at a write power level when recording data to the disc.</p>
    <p num="41">Based on the read clock and read data output from the reproduction signal processor 106, a format encoder/decoder 107 reproduces the address information recorded to a header area on the optical disc 101, and comprises a timing signal generator 111.</p>
    <p num="42">
      Based on this reproduced address information, the timing signal generator 111 generates and supplies timing signals required for recording and reproducing at a timing synchronized to a particular sector of the optical disc 101.
      <br/>
      For example, the timing signal generator 111 outputs a read gate or other timing signal required by the reproduction signal processor 106 for address and data digitizing and PLL processing.
      <br/>
      During recording, the timing signal generator 111 outputs a write gate or other timing signal to the laser driver 108 to enable emitting at the write power level.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      During recording, the format encoder/decoder 107 adds redundant coding such as an error correction code to user data supplied through a host interface 109 from an external device.
      <br/>
      The format encoder/decoder 107 then modulates the signal according to a predetermined format, and supplies the modulated signal to the laser driver 108 as the data to be recorded as a bit sequence to disc.
      <br/>
      During reproduction, the format encoder/decoder 107 reproduces address information recorded to a header area of optical disc 101 based on the read clock and read data output from the reproduction signal processor 106, demodulates and error correction processes user data recorded to the data recording area, and then sends the error corrected data through host interface 109 to an external device.
    </p>
    <p num="44">The system controller 110 interprets commands supplied thereto through host interface 109 from an external device, and controls operation of the servo means 105, reproduction signal processor 106, format encoder/decoder 107, laser driver 108, and host interface 109 to record or reproduce data to a specific sector of the optical disc 101.</p>
    <p num="45">The timing signal generator 111, which is an essential part of an optical disc drive according to the present invention, can be achieved in various ways, and seven specific embodiments thereof are first described briefly and then in detail below.</p>
    <p num="46">Embodiment 1</p>
    <p num="47">A timing signal generator 111 according to a first version of the invention generates timing signals using a counting circuit for counting a read clock generated by a phase-locked loop from a reproduction signal, and a counting circuit for counting the reference clock for recording and reproducing operations.</p>

    <p num="49">A timing signal generator 111 according to a second version of the invention generates timing signals using a single counting circuit, driving the counting circuit to switch on a time-share basis between a read clock generated by a phase-locked loop from a reproduction signal, and the reference clock for recording and reproducing operations.</p>
    <p num="50">Embodiment 3</p>
    <p num="51">A timing signal generator 111 according to a third version of the invention generates timing signals using a counting circuit for counting a read clock generated by a phase-locked loop from a reproduction signal, and a counting circuit for counting a wobble clock reproduced from a wobble groove.</p>

    <p num="53">A timing signal generator 111 according to a fourth version of the invention generates timing signals using a counting circuit for counting a read clock generated by a phase-locked loop from a reproduction signal and the results of reproduction signal envelope detection, and a counting circuit for counting the reference clock for recording and reproducing operations.</p>
    <p num="54">Embodiment 5</p>
    <p num="55">A timing signal generator 111 according to a fifth version of the invention generates timing signals by driving the counting circuit to switch on a time-share basis between a read clock generated by a phase-locked loop from a reproduction signal, and the reference clock for recording and reproducing operations, and using the counting circuit and the results of reproduction signal envelope detection.</p>
    <p num="56">Embodiment 6</p>
    <p num="57">A timing signal generator 111 according to a sixth version of the invention generates timing signals using a counting circuit for counting a read clock generated by a phase-locked loop from a reproduction signal and the results of reproduction signal envelope detection, and a counting circuit for counting a wobble clock reproduced from a wobble groove.</p>
    <p num="58">Embodiment 7</p>
    <p num="59">A timing signal generator 111 according to a seventh version of the invention generates timing signals using a counting circuit for counting a read clock generated by a phase-locked loop from a reproduction signal and the results of reproduction signal envelope detection, and a counting circuit time-share switched between counting a reference clock and a wobble clock reproduced from a wobble groove.</p>
    <p num="60">
      A timing signal generator 111 according to a first embodiment of the present invention as shown in FIG. 2 is described first below.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 2, a reproduction signal digitizer 201 digitizes a reproduction signal read from an optical disc.
      <br/>
      A PLL circuit 202 phase locks the digitized reproduction signal from the reproduction signal digitizer 201 with a reference clock from a reference clock generator 203, and outputs a read clock 208 synchronized to the reproduction signal, and read data 209, which is the reproduced data synchronized by read clock 208.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The reference clock generator 203 may be, for example, a quartz oscillator or frequency synthesizer (the specific configuration not shown in the figures), for generating and supplying a reference clock.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that a reference clock as used herein is a clock signal where one clock period is the time of one channel bit when the optical disc is spun at a predetermined angular velocity or linear velocity.
      <br/>
      For example, when recording or reproducing to a CAV, CLV, or ZCLV control type optical disc, the defined period of one channel bit is the same (constant) at every radial position on the disc.
      <br/>
      As a result, a quartz oscillator output can be used as supplied.
      <br/>
      When recording or reproducing a ZCAV type disc, however, the defined period of one channel differs in each zone.
      <br/>
      Quartz oscillator output must therefore be gradually adjusted by a different known factor in each zone to derive and output the reference clock.
      <br/>
      This reference clock is used by the format encoder/decoder 107 to generate the recording data, that is, the recording data is output in a format synchronized to the reference clock.
      <br/>
      The reference clock can also be used by the servo 105 for measuring time in the rotational control of disc motor 102.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      An address reproducer 204 detects and reproduces address information using the read clock 208 and read data 209.
      <br/>
      The address reproducer 204 outputs this address information to the system controller 110, and outputs an address detection signal indicative of the timing at which the address information was detected when address error in a given sector is below a specific level.
      <br/>
      This address detection signal is a pulse signal output when the address information is detected without error, for example, and is used as a reference for sector synchronization.
      <br/>
      Roughly, there are about 17 to 40 sectors in one rotation track.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      A first sector counter 205 is a circuit for counting the length of one sector using the read clock supplied from the PLL circuit 202.
      <br/>
      For example, if the length of one sector is 2697 bytes, and 1 byte equals 16 channel bits, the first sector counter 205 can be 16-bit loop counter that counts from 0 to 43,151 (=2697 * 16-1), and then resets to 0.
      <br/>
      Sector length can also be expressed as the bit or byte position count from a specific sector address position by presetting the counter to a specific value at the address detection signal timing.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      A second sector counter 206 is a circuit for counting the length of one sector using the reference clock supplied from a reference clock generator.
      <br/>
      This second sector counter 206 can also be a loop counter as described above.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, sector length can be expressed, as described above, as the bit or byte position count from a specific sector address position by presetting the counter to a specific value at the address detection signal timing.
    </p>
    <p num="65">The gate signal generating circuit 207 generates and supplies the various gate signals for controlling the operation of other circuit blocks using the counter values output from the first and second sector counters 205 and 206.</p>
    <p num="66">The relationship between the precision of the actual sector positions and the counter values indicative thereof output from the first sector counter 205 and second sector counter 206 is considered below.</p>
    <p num="67">As noted above, the counter output from first sector counter 205 is the result of counting synchronized to the read clock, and counter precision is therefore dependent on the precision of the read clock.</p>
    <p num="68">
      As also noted above, each sector on a rewritable optical disc typically has blank areas where no data is recorded.
      <br/>
      As described above with reference to FIG. 17, these include the gap 1703, buffer area 1705, and the data recording area 1704 of unrecorded sectors.
      <br/>
      Because the read clock is derived by phase locking with the digitized reproduction signal as described above, phase locking is, in principle, not possible when the laser spot is focused in an area where there is no data (a "blank area" below).
      <br/>
      When traversing a blank area, PLL circuit 202 operation is normally phase locked to the reference clock, or held the frequency immediately before the blank area is entered.
      <br/>
      It is therefore not possible to track variations in linear velocity, for example, when traversing a blank area, and a certain error is thus introduced to the read clock frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Read clock precision also depends upon the quality of the reproduction signal.
      <br/>
      If the reproduction signal is degraded by disc defects, for example, read clock jitter increases, and phase synchronization of the PLL circuit 202 may not be possible.
    </p>
    <p num="70">As a result of the above factors, counter output from the first sector counter 205 cannot accurately express the current position in a sector when read clock precision is degraded.</p>
    <p num="71">
      Counter output from the second sector counter 206, on the other hand, is derived from the reference clock, and error relative to absolute time is therefore within the limits of quartz oscillator and frequency synthesizer precision.
      <br/>
      Error is therefore small enough to be effectively ignored.
      <br/>
      Counter output in this case is also not dependent on the quality of the reproduction signal, and counter output is therefore not affected by disc defects, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      However, the angular velocity of the disc deviates from the reference during or immediately after the optical head 103 moves radially to the disc for an address search operation with CLV, ZCLV, and other control methods whereby angular velocity varies with the radial position of the disc.
      <br/>
      As a result, counter output from the second sector counter 206 differs from the actual sector position.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Furthermore, when the reference clock frequency differs between zones as it does with ZCAV control media, the relationship between zone and reference clock frequency can deviate as a result of address searching between zones and when the optical disc drive starts up.
      <br/>
      As a result, counter output from the second sector counter 206 also differs from the actual sector position in this case.
    </p>
    <p num="74">A circuit enabling consistently precise representation of the sector position considering the relationship between actual sector positions and sector positions represented by counter output from a first sector counter 205 using a read clock, and counter output from a second sector counter 206 using a reference clock, is described next below.</p>
    <p num="75">FIG. 8 is a block diagram showing an internal configuration of a gate signal generating circuit 207 in the timing signal generator 111 shown in FIG. 2 according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="76">The gate signal generating circuit 207 shown in FIG. 8 outputs a read gate for controlling PLL operation or digitizing by the reproduction signal processor 106 shown in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="77">Referring to FIG. 13(B), a timing chart of the read gate for controlling the PLL operation by the PLL circuit 202 and the digitizing operation by the signal digitizer 201 is shown.</p>
    <p num="78">
      Header area 1302 has a total length of 128 bytes with 36 byte long VFO pattern inserted in the front.
      <br/>
      What follows after the VFO pattern are an address mark representing the leading portion of the address information, and an address information data coded according to a predetermined coding rule.
      <br/>
      The VFO pattern is, for example, a repetition of 4T mark and 4T space alternately, and is used for obtaining rapid lock-in state of the PLL for the reproduction of data and clock from the reproduced signal.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The signal digitizer 201 first rapidly carries out the slicing level adjusting operation by the internally provided slice level adjusting circuit during the reading of the VFO pattern until the slicing level is appropriately adjusted.
      <br/>
      After reading the VFO pattern, the the signal digitizer 201 moderately carries out the slicing level adjusting operation by the internally provided slice level adjusting circuit during the reading of the address mark and the address information data.
      <br/>
      The switching between rapid and moderate adjusting operations of the slicing level is done by changing the time constant value of the circuit through a suitable control signal which is obtained from the read gate.
      <br/>
      When the read gate is in the LOW level, the slice level adjustment is carried out rapidly, and when the read gate is in the HIGH level, the slice level adjustment is carried out moderately.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      To obtain the rapid and stable synchronization of the reproduced signal, it is preferable to start the lock-in operation of the digitized data to be in synchronized state with the PLL circuit, as soon as possible from the time point at which the slicing level is completely adjusted to the VFO pattern by the signal digitizer 201.
      <br/>
      In other words, unless the slicing level is properly adjusted to the reproduced signal to produce appropriate binary signals, the phase comparison with the binary data will not be carried out, and therefore, the phase synchronization of the binary date will not be carried out.
      <br/>
      Thus, the read gate is used for controlling the PLL operation.
      <br/>
      The PLL operation is controlled to be in phase synchronization with the binary data only when the read gate is in HIGH level.

      As explained above, in order to read the address information data in the header area 1302, it is necessary to use the 36 bytes of VFO pattern for both the slice level adjustment and the PLL lock-in operation in time sharing manner.
      <br/>
      According to one example, a minimum length data of the VFO pattern necessary for the slice level adjustment is 12 bytes.
      <br/>
      This minimum length data can be calculated by using the one cycle period of the data one channel bit, an amplitude of the reproduced signal applied to signal digitizer 201, and a time constant of the circuit during the rapid slice level adjustment.
      <br/>
      Also in the same example, the minimum length data of the VFO pattern necessary for the PLL lock-in operation is 20 bytes.
      <br/>
      This minimum length data can be calculated by using the one cycle period of the data one channel bit and the loop gain of the PLL.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Therefore, according to the above example, the rise-up timing of the read gate in the header area 1302 should be after 12 bytes from the leading edge of the header area 1302 so as to obtain enough bytes for the slice level adjustment.
      <br/>
      Also, to obtain enough bytes for the PLL lock-in operation, it is necessary to have more than 20 bytes from the rise-up timing to the end of the VFO pattern, that is the rise-up timing of the read gate in the header area 1302 should be before 16 bytes from the leading edge of the header area 1302.
    </p>
    <p num="83">Also, the rise-down timing of the read gate should be after the end of the header area 1302 so that the address information data in the header area 1302 can be completely in the phase synchronized state in the PLL circuit.</p>
    <p num="84">Also, after the end of the header area 1302, since there will be no binary data necessary for the PLL phase synchronization, the read gate immediately becomes HIGH to prevent the phase synchronization.</p>
    <p num="85">
      In the example shown in FIG. 13(B), the rise-up timing of the read gate in the header area 1302 is selected at 14 bytes from the leading edge of the header area 1302 so that enough bytes are reserved for the slice level adjustment and for the PLL lock-in operation.
      <br/>
      Also, the rise-down timing of the read gate is selected at 2 bytes after the trailing edge of the header area 1302.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the rise-up timing of the read gate can have an allowed deviation error of  +- 2 bytes, and also the rise-down timing of the read gate can have an allowed deviation error of  +- 2 bytes.

      Referring to FIG. 3, a clock selector 301 selects either the read clock output from the PLL circuit 202, or the reference clock output from the reference clock generator 203, and outputs the selected clock to a sector counter 302.

      Signal selection by the clock selector 301 is determined according to the disc rotation state signal output from the servo 105 (FIG. 1).

    <p num="107">
      As described with reference to the related art above, the wobble signal period is normally sufficiently long compared with the period of the address information in the header area and user data recorded to the user data area.

      As a result, the phase locking speed of the wobble clock PLL is slower than that of the PLL circuit 202 for reproducing the read clock.
      <br/>
      This is because the clock phase is synchronized using the transition point (edge) information of the signal to which the PLL is applied.
      <br/>
      That is, if the period of the wobble signal is 100 times the period of the recorded data, the time required to lock in the wobble clock will be approximately 100 times the time required for the read clock based on a very simple comparison.
      <br/>
      Conversely, however, the wobble clock offers greater PLL stability when there are scratches or other disc defects.
      <br/>
      This is because, assuming a defect of a particular length, the amount of edge information damaged by the defect is relatively little compared to the period of the wobble signal, and the effect of the defect on the PLL is therefore also less.

    <p num="128">(2) Interpolated sector synchronization state</p>
    <p num="129">
      An interpolated sector synchronization state is indicated when the address detection signal was not output in the current sector, but was output at least once within a specific number of sectors before the current sector.

      <br/>
      However, error resulting from variation in the linear velocity caused by deviation from the specified disc speed and disc eccentricity, for example, will occur.

    <p num="135">
      A sector synchronization stopped state is indicated when address reproduction by the address reproducer 204 has stopped.

    <p num="136">These four states are discriminated based on the sector synchronization state signal output by the sector synchronization state monitor 503, thereby enabling other circuit blocks to determine the sector synchronization state based on this sector synchronization state signal.</p>

      The gate signal generating circuit 502 in the timing signal generator 111 outputs a read gate enabling address reproduction to the reproduction signal digitizer 201 and PLL circuit 202 of the reproduction signal processor 106.
      <br/>
      The address reproducer 204 thus detects and reproduces an address using the read data and read clock output from the PLL circuit 202, and outputs an address detection signal.

      Note that data recording and reproducing do not occur in this sector synchronization lock-in state.

      When address information is reproduced in a particular sector with an error level below a specified level, and an address detection signal is output, the normal sector synchronization state is entered.

      <br/>
      Data recording and reproducing are possible in this state.
      <br/>
      The gate signal generating circuit 502 of the timing signal generator 111 outputs a read gate to the reproduction signal digitizer 201 and PLL circuit 202 for address reproduction and, as required, data reproduction.
      <br/>
      When data recording is desired, the gate signal generating circuit 502 outputs a write gate signal to the laser driver 108.
      <br/>
      This normal sector synchronization state is held as long as the optical head is tracking correctly, and the address detection signal continues to be output.

    <p num="142">
      If tracking is disrupted as a result of seeking a new address, or the optical head deviates from the normal tracking position of the current track, the sector synchronization lock-in state is resumed.
      <br/>
      This is because data recording and reproducing are not possible when tracking is off, and when tracking is resumed, it is necessary to quickly resume address reproduction.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      In addition, if address detection fails in some sector, or the number of errors in the detected address information exceeds some predefined threshold, when in the normal sector synchronization state, the interpolated sector synchronization state is entered.

      The sector synchronization state monitor 503 outputs a "10" sector synchronization state signal in the interpolated sector synchronization state.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, if tracking is switched off or address errors exceeding some threshold occur in a specific number of continuous sectors, the sector synchronization lock-in state is assumed.
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      This specified number of sectors is predefined based on errors occurring at the sector position of the gate signal output in the interpolated sector synchronization state.
      <br/>
      That is, the error (difference) between the actual bit position in the sector and the output of first sector counter 205 (or second sector counter 206) occurring in one sector when address information is continuously not detected is defined as error e1.
      <br/>
      In other words, error e1 is the difference between the actual position and the counted position.
      <br/>
      The allowable error for a particular gate signal is defined as error e2, and the specific number of sectors is n. If n is then defined such that
      <br/>
      e1 * n&lt;e2,
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      the timing error of a particular gate signal will be within an allowable range even if the interpolated sector synchronization state continues for n sectors.

      Data recording and reproducing are therefore possible in this state by interpolating sector synchronization.
    </p>
    <p num="146">
      However, particular care is required for data recording because errors are present in the address information in sectors in which the interpolated sector synchronization state is set.
      <br/>
      More specifically, errors in the address information mean that data reproduction may not be sufficiently reliable.
      <br/>
      This means that, for example, if the optical disc and drive are used for data storage with a computer, some means of moving data from the sector with errors to a sector where reliable data reproduction is possible is preferably implemented as soon as possible.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished, for example, by replacement of sectors where errors occur by registering them as defective sectors where data recording is prevented, and recording the data to a different, error-free sectors.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      If the interpolated sector synchronization state is set during data reproduction, this mode is used because it is necessary to reproduce user data recorded to the data recording area.

      More specifically, stable data reproduction is possible even if there are errors in the address information insofar as the gate signal timing error is within a specific limited range.

      <br/>
      A gate signal generating circuit 502 according to this preferred embodiment outputs a read gate for controlling digitizing and PLL operation in the reproduction signal processor 106 shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the first decoding circuit 801 and second decoding circuit 802 shown in FIG. 10 have the same operation and function as those shown in FIG. 8, and further description thereof is thus omitted below.

    <p num="149">
      Referring to FIG. 10, a delay circuit 1001 delays the envelope detection output from envelope detection circuit 501 for a predefined period.
      <br/>
      This delay circuit 1001 can be a digital circuit construction such as a shift register or counter for delaying envelope detection output a specific clock count, or it can be an analog circuit construction such as an analog delay for delaying envelope detection output a specific time by analog means.
    </p>
    <p num="150">AND circuit 1002 obtains the logical AND of the envelope detection output and the delayed output from the delay circuit 1001.</p>
    <p num="151">The selection controller 1003 selects the output from AND circuit 1002, first decoding circuit 801, and second decoding circuit 802 on a time-share basis using the disc rotation state signal from the servo 105 and the sector synchronization state signal from the sector synchronization state monitor 503 to output the read gate.</p>
    <p num="152">FIG. 13 is a timing diagram used to describe the operation of the selection control means 1003 in a gate signal generating circuit 502 shown in FIG. 10 according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="153">
      Using time signal waveforms, FIG. 13(A) shows read gate generation from when tracking is on until the address information is read and sector synchronization can be held normally.
      <br/>
      Note that time progresses from left to right, and it is assumed below that the sector synchronization lock-in state is set at the first (left-most) of the six continuous sectors shown in FIG. 13.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      FIG. 13(B) shows the ideal timing of a read gate in the header area 1302 with the rising edge (where the signal goes high from low) of the read gate occurring at a specific number of bytes from the beginning of the header area 1302.
      <br/>
      If sector marks are recorded at the beginning of the header area 1302, this specific number of bytes is at least the number of bytes equivalent to the sector mark length; if a sector mark is not recorded and the sector starts with a VFO pattern, this specific number of bytes is equivalent to the time required for the reproduction signal digitizer 201 to reliably adjust the digital slicing level to the VFO pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      The top row in FIG. 13(A) shows six successive sectors on a disc.
      <br/>
      The sectors are sequentially labelled 1301a to 1301f, and each sector includes a header area 1302 (indicated by shading), and a data recording area 1303 (indicated by a white box).
      <br/>
      The "o" and "x" symbols below the header area 1302 of each sector indicate whether address information can be read from the corresponding header area 1302 without errors.
      <br/>
      A "o" symbol indicates error-free address reading; a "x" indicates errors are present in the address information.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      The envelope detection output shown in the second row represents the waveform of the envelope detection input to the delay circuit 1001 and AND circuit 1002 in FIG. 10. Note that the envelope detection output is high in the header area 1302 of each sector from 1301a to 1301f.
      <br/>
      The envelope detection output remains low for part of header area 1302 in sector 1301e, however, because of an error in that header area 1302.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      The AND circuit output wave represents the output waveform of the AND circuit 1002 in FIG. 10. The rising edge (the low to high transition) of the AND circuit output is delayed a specific time from the rising edge of the envelope detection output, and AND circuit output therefore remains high for a shorter period.
      <br/>
      The delay to the rising edge of the AND output is the time equivalent to the specific number of bytes (14 bytes) described above with reference to FIG. 13(B).
      <br/>
      Note, however, that because of the error in header area 1302 of sector 1301e, AND circuit output does not go high within this delay.
    </p>
    <p num="158">
      The first decoder output represents the output from the first decoding circuit 801 in FIG. 10. As described with reference to FIG. 8, the first decoding circuit 801 decodes the read clock synchronized output of the first counter such that the first decoder output goes high when the output from the first counter indicates a specific byte position.
      <br/>
      Because the first counter is synchronized to the timing at which address information can be correctly detected, a high first decoder output is probably offset from the correct byte position in a sector where address information cannot be detected.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      The second decoder output represents the output from the second decoding circuit 802 in FIG. 10. As described with reference to FIG. 8, the second decoding circuit 802 decodes the reference clock synchronized output of the second counter such that the second decoder output goes high when the output from the second counter indicates a specific byte position.
      <br/>
      Like the first counter, the second counter is also synchronized to a timing at which address information can be correctly detected, and a high second decoder output is probably offset from the correct byte position in a sector where address information cannot be detected.
      <br/>
      However, when the disc speed is within a specific range, that is, when the disc rotation state signal is high, and address information is correctly detected in some sector, address information detection can fail in a following sector and the high period will still not deviate significantly from the specified position for a specific number of sectors.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      The sector synchronization state signal is the signal input to the selection control means 1003 in FIG. 10. As described above, the sector synchronization state signal is "00" to indicate the sector synchronization lock-in state until the address information is first detected after tracking is on.
      <br/>
      When the address information is then detected in sector 1301b, the state signal goes "01" indicating a normal sector synchronization state.
      <br/>
      Address information continues to be correctly detected in the following sectors 1301c and 1301d, and the state signal therefore remains "01" to hold the normal sector synchronization state.
      <br/>
      When address information detection fails in sector 1301e, however, the state signal goes to "10", indicating an interpolated sector synchronization state is set.
      <br/>
      When address information is then correctly detected in sector 1301f, the state signal returns to "01", indicating that a normal sector synchronization state is reset.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      The disc rotation state signal is the signal input to selection control means 1003 in FIG. 10. The disc rotation state signal is shown low from when tracking is on until part way into sector 1301d, and then goes high.
      <br/>
      A low disc rotation state signal indicates that the disk speed is changing due to a seek operation.
      <br/>
      The signal going high somewhere in sector 1301d indicates that the disc speed has stabilized to within a specified range.
    </p>
    <p num="162">The read gate represents the output from the selection control means 1003 in FIG. 10. It should be noted that the read gate is active (high) only in the header area of each sector shown in FIG. 13 because the only header area address information is reproduced, and user data is not reproduced from the data recording area of each sector in this example.</p>
    <p num="163">
      The read gate is time-share switched as shown in the figure between the AND circuit output, first decoder output, and second decoder output.
      <br/>
      While passing the header area of sectors 1301a and 1301b, the AND circuit output is passed as the read gate because the sector synchronization lock-in state is set.
      <br/>
      In the header area of sectors 1301c and 1301d, the normal sector synchronization state is set and the disc rotation state signal is low; the first decoder output is therefore selected as the read gate.
      <br/>
      In the header area of sectors 1301e and 1301f, the normal sector synchronization state and interpolated sector synchronization state are respectively set, but the disc rotation state signal is high; the second decoder output is therefore selected as the read gate.

    <p num="167">If the address information could not be read in the previous sector, but was read correctly within a specific number of preceding sectors (the interpolated sector synchronization state is set), read gate output is based on the envelope of the reproduction signal if the disc speed is not within a specific range; if the disc speed is within this range, read gate output is based on the output of the second sector counter 206, synchronized to the reference clock.</p>

      It is therefore possible to set the read gate timing based on a reference enabling the location in a particular sector to be most accurately expressed under all operating conditions.

      The data reproduction operation of other circuit blocks, particularly the reproduction signal digitizer 201 and PLL circuit 202, can therefore be stopped, and unnecessary power consumption can be reduced.

      It will also be obvious that while the present embodiment has been described with reference to a method for generating read gate timing in the header area for address reproduction, it can also be used for determining read gate timing to reproduce data from the user data area.

      It can also be used to determine the timing for any other gate signal where the gate signal level changes according to the sector byte position.

    <p num="209">First, when the address information can be read normally and the normal sector synchronization state is thus set, or the address information could not be read in the previous sector, but was read correctly within a specific number of preceding sectors (the interpolated sector synchronization state is set), ID gate output is based on the output of the first sector counter 402, which is synchronized to the read clock, if the wobble clock is not phase locked to the wobble signal on disc; if the wobble clock is phase locked, ID gate output is based on the output of the second sector counter 403, synchronized to the wobble clock.</p>
    <p num="210">
      The ID gate signal at this time assures a high signal level in the header area and a low signal level in the data recording area in order to ensure reliable selection of the signal separation and detection methods required for reproducing address information in the header area, and recording/reproducing user data in the data recording area.
      <br/>
      As a result, the ID gate goes high timed to ensure that the header area will be covered.
      <br/>
      As noted in the description of the related art above, there are typically gap and buffer areas to which no signals are recorded before and after the data recording area in most common rewritable optical disc formats, and there is therefore a certain tolerance in the timing precision required for the ID gate.
      <br/>
      A certain offset in ID gate synchronization can therefore be tolerated in the interpolated sector synchronization state.
    </p>
    <p num="211">If the address information cannot be read from a specific number of consecutive sectors, and the bit or byte position in a sector cannot be accurately indicated by the output of either first sector counter 402 or second sector counter 403 (the sector synchronization lock-in state is set), the ID gate signal is held active (high) because address reproduction must be continued to locate a sector as soon as possible.</p>
    <p num="212">
      It is therefore possible to set the ID gate timing based on a reference enabling the location in a particular sector to be most accurately expressed under all operating conditions.
      <br/>
      Address and data reproduction can therefore be completed reliably at high speed.
    </p>
    <p num="213">It should be noted that when it is not necessary to read address information, such as in the sector synchronization stopped state, the ID gate can be low or high because it is not necessary to change the signal separation and detection method.</p>

      <br/>
      This gate signal generating circuit 1502 also outputs a write gate to the laser driver 108 to enable emitting at the laser power level required for data recording when recording is requested.

    <p num="225">First, when the address information can be read normally (a normal sector synchronization state is set), and either the wobble clock state signal or disc rotation state signal is high, the write enable signal goes high to enable writing (recording).</p>
    <p num="226">If the address information could not be read in the previous sector, but was read correctly within a specific number of preceding sectors (the interpolated sector synchronization state is set), the write enable signal goes low (a write disabled state) if the wobble clock state signal is low; if the wobble clock state signal is high, the write enable signal can be set high or low to enable writing as desired.</p>
    <p num="227">If the address information cannot be read from a specific number of consecutive sectors, and the bit or byte position in a sector cannot be accurately indicated by the output of either first sector counter 402 or second sector counter 403 (the sector synchronization lock-in state is set), or if it is not necessary to read address information (sector synchronization stopped state), the write enable signal is fixed low.</p>
    <p num="228">
      It is therefore possible to set the write gate active (high in the present embodiment) only when the write enable signal is high.
      <br/>
      It is therefore also possible to permit data recording only when the second counter output accurately represents a precise sector bit or byte position.
      <br/>
      The reliability of data recording operations can thus be improved.
    </p>
    <p num="229">It should also be noted that when the interpolated sector synchronization state is set and the wobble clock state signal is high, the write gate can be set active even when the address information cannot be continuously read correctly by adjusting the level of the write enable signal.</p>
    <p num="230">
      It should be further noted that because the write gate is generated synchronized to the wobble clock when the wobble clock state signal is high, this preferred embodiment as shown in FIGS. 15 and 16 can also enable recording when the disc speed is not within the specified range.
      <br/>
      When the wobble clock state signal is low, the write gate is generated synchronized to the reference clock.
      <br/>
      As a result, recording can also be enabled insofar as the disc speed is within a specified range even if the wobble clock phase is not synchronized.
    </p>
    <p num="231">
      Compared with a device according to the prior art, recording is therefore possible under a wider range of conditions with a timing signal generator 111 according to this preferred embodiment.

      Data recording can therefore occur more quickly, and optical disc drive performance is thus improved.
    </p>
    <p num="232">
      As will be known from the above descriptions of the preferred embodiments, an optical disc drive according to the present invention can measure a specific sector bit or byte position on an optical disc using both a read clock obtained from the reproduction signal, and a reference clock of a specific period.
      <br/>
      It is therefore possible to generate the timing for sector synchronized gate signals insofar as one of the clocks is output at the rated frequency, even if the disc speed is not within a specified range or the read clock quality is poor.
    </p>
    <p num="233">Stable address information reading is therefore possible even when the disc speed deviates from the specified range as a result of a seek operation crossing multiple zones on a ZCLV type disc, or PLL locking is lost due to a disc error and read clock frequency is shifted.</p>
    <p num="234">It will also be obvious that an optical disc drive according to the present invention can monitor address information reading in each sector, determine the sector synchronization state based on the monitored output, and switch the gate signal timing method according to the sector synchronization state and the disc rotation state.</p>
    <p num="235">
      It is therefore possible to consistently set gate timing based on a reference enabling the location in a particular sector to be most accurately expressed under all operating conditions.
      <br/>
      Data recording and reproduction can therefore be completed with high reliability at high speed.
    </p>
    <p num="236">
      The present invention also provides a timing signal generator for generating a write gate signal, and processing and recording data, using a clock reproduced from a wobble groove or clock pits when this clock is phase locked.
      <br/>
      When this clock is not phase locked, a reference clock derived from a quartz oscillator, frequency synthesizer, or other device can be used for generating a write gate signal, and processing and recording data, when the disc speed is within a specified range.
    </p>
    <p num="237">
      It is therefore possible to record data even when the disc speed deviates from a defined disc speed range, and when a clock cannot be reproduced from a wobble groove or clock pits due to disc errors.
      <br/>
      As a result, data recording and reproduction can be completed with high reliability at high speed.
