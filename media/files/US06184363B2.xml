    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has raised fears of an approaching medical catastrophe (Neu, Science, 257, 1064-1073 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Evolutionary selection and genetic transformation have made this problem pressing.
      <br/>
      Most antibiotic drugs are derivatives of naturally occurring bactericides (Davies, Science, 264, 375-382 (1994)), and many resistance mechanisms evolved long ago.
      <br/>
      Human use of antibiotics has refined these mechanisms and promoted their spread through gene transfer (Davies, Science, 264, 375-382 (1994)).
      <br/>
      A resistance mechanism originating in one species of bacteria can be expected to spread throughout the biosphere.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Bacterial adaptations to  BETA -lactam drugs (e.g., amoxicillin, cephalothin, clavulanate, aztreonam) are among the best studied and most pernicious forms of antibiotic resistance.  BETA -lactams target enzymes that are unique to bacteria and are thus highly selective.
      <br/>
      They have been widely prescribed.
      <br/>
      In the absence of resistance,  BETA -lactams are the first choice for treatment in 45 of 78 common bacterial infections (Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (Hardman et al., eds., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996)).
      <br/>
      The evolution of resistance to these drugs has raised the cost of antibiotic therapy and reduced its effectiveness, leading to increased rates of morbidity and mortality.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      BETA -lactam antibiotics inhibit bacterial cell wall biosynthesis (Tomasz, Rev.
      <br/>
      Infect. Dis., 8, S270-S278 (1986)).
      <br/>
      The drugs form covalent complexes with a group of transpeptidases/carboxypeptidases called penicillin binding proteins (PBPs).
      <br/>
      PBP inactivation disrupts cell wall biosynthesis, leading to self-lysis and death of the bacteria.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Bacteria use several different mechanisms to escape from  BETA -lactam drugs (Sanders, Clinical Infectious Disease, 14, 1089-1099 (1992); Li et al., Antimicrob.
      <br/>
      Agents Chemother., 39, 1948-1953 (1995)).
      <br/>
      Probably the most widespread is the hydrolysis of  BETA -lactams by  BETA -lactamase enzymes.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      TEM-1 and AmpC are two  BETA -lactamases from Escherichia coli. E. coli is an important pathogen in its own right.
      <br/>
      It is the most common cause of gram-negative bacterial infection in humans (Levine, New Engl. J. Med., 313, 445-447 (1985)), and is the most prevalent hospital-acquired infection (Thornsberry, Pharmacotherapy, 15, S3-8 (1995)). E. coli that carry TEM-1, or for which AmpC production has been derepressed, are resistant to  BETA -lactam treatment.
      <br/>
      As of 1992, as many as 30% of community-isolated E. coli and 40-50% of hospital-acquired E. coli in the United States were resistant to  BETA -lactams such as amoxicillin (Neu, Science, 257, 1064-1073 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Many of these resistant E. coli are resistant to  BETA -lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      TEM-1 and AmpC are major forms of plasmid-based and chromosomal  BETA -lactamases and are responsible for resistance in a broad host range.
      <br/>
      The versions of TEM and AmpC (Galleni, et al., Biochem. J., 250, 753-760 (1988)) in other bacterial species share high sequence identity to TEM-1 and AmpC from E. coli.
      <br/>
      TEM-1 structurally and catalytically resembles the class A  BETA -lactamase from Staphlococcus aureus.
      <br/>
      The structures of AmpC from Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae have been determined, and they closely resemble the structure of the E. coli enzyme (Usher et al., Biochemistry, 30, 16082-16092 (1998)).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      To overcome the action of  BETA -lactamases, medicinal chemists have introduced compounds that inhibit these enzymes, such as clavulanic acid, or compounds that are less susceptible to enzyme hydrolysis, such as aztreonam.
      <br/>
      Both have been widely used in antibiotic therapy (Rolinson, Rev.
      <br/>
      Infect. Diseases 13, S727-732 (1991)); both are  BETA -lactams.
      <br/>
      Their similarity to the drugs that they are meant to protect or replace has allowed bacteria to evolve further, maintaining their resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Resistance to these new classes of  BETA -lactams has arisen through modifications of previously successful mechanisms.
      <br/>
      Point substitutions in  BETA -lactamases allow the enzymes to hydrolyze compounds designed to evade them (Philippon et al., Antimicrob.
      <br/>
      Agents Chemother., 33, 1131-1136 (1989)).
      <br/>
      Other substitutions reduce the affinity of  BETA -lactam inhibitors for the enzymes (Saves, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270, 18240-18245 (1995)) or allow the enzymes to simply hydrolyze them.
      <br/>
      Several gram positive bacteria, such as Staph. aureus, have acquired sensor proteins that detect  BETA -lactams in the environment of the cell (Bennet and Chopra, Antimicrob.
      <br/>
      Agents Chemotherapy, 37, 153-158 (1993)).  BETA -lactam binding to these sensors leads to transcriptional up-regulation of the  BETA -lactamase.  BETA -lactam inhibitors of  BETA -lactamases, thus, can induce the production of the enzyme that they are meant to inhibit, defeating themselves.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      It is noteworthy that the human therapeutic attack on bacteria has paralleled the path taken in nature.
      <br/>
      Several species of soil bacteria and fungi produce  BETA -lactams, presumably as weapons against other bacteria (although this remains a matter of debate).
      <br/>
      Over evolutionary time, susceptible bacteria have responded to  BETA -lactams with lactamases, among other defenses.
      <br/>
      In turn, soil bacteria have produced  BETA -lactams that resist hydrolysis by  BETA -lactamases or have produced  BETA -lactams that inhibit the  BETA -lactamases.
      <br/>
      Streptomyces clavuligeris makes several  BETA -lactams, including clavulanic acid, a clinically used inhibitor of class A  BETA -lactamases such as TEM-1.
      <br/>
      Chromobacterium violaceum makes aztreonam, a clinically used monobactam that resists hydrolysis by many  BETA -lactamases.
      <br/>
      One reason why bacteria have been able to respond rapidly with "new" resistance mechanisms to  BETA -lactams, and indeed many classes of antibiotics, is that the mechanisms are not in fact new.
      <br/>
      As long as medicinal chemistry focuses on new  BETA -lactam molecules to overcome  BETA -lactamases, resistance can be expected to follow shortly.
      <br/>
      The logic will hold for any family of antibiotic where the lead drug, and resistance mechanisms to it, originated in the biosphere long before their human therapeutic use.
      <br/>
      This includes the aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, the tetracyclines and vancomycin.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      One way to avoid recapitulating this ancient "arms race" would be to develop inhibitors that have novel chemistries, dissimilar to  BETA -lactams.
      <br/>
      These non- BETA -lactam inhibitors would not themselves be degraded by  BETA -lactamases, and mutations in the enzymes should not render them labile to hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      Novel inhibitors would escape detection by  BETA -lactam sensor proteins that up-regulate  BETA -lactamase transcription, and may be unaffected by porin mutations that limit the access of  BETA -lactams to PBPs.
      <br/>
      Such inhibitors would allow current  BETA -lactam drugs to work against bacteria where  BETA -lactamases provide the dominant resistance mechansim.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      It has previously been reported that boric acid and certain phenyl boronic acids are inhibitors of certain  BETA -lactamases.
      <br/>
      See, Kiener and Waley, Biochem. J., 169, 197-204 (1978) (boric acid, phenylboronic acid (2FDB) and m-aminophenylboronate (MAPB)); Beesley et al., Biochem. J., 209, 229-233 (1983) (twelve substituted phenylborinic acids, including 2-formylphenylboronate (2FORMB), 4-formylphenylboronate (4FORMB), and 4-methylphenylboronate (4MEPB)); Amicosante et al., J. Chemotherapy, 1, 394-398 (1989) (boric acid, 2FDB, MAPB and tetraphenylboronic acid).
      <br/>
      More recently, m-(dansylamidophenyl)-boronic acid (NSULFB) has been reported to be a submicromolar inhibitor of the Enterobacter cloacae P99  BETA -lactamase.

      In these figures, BuLi is butyl lithium.
      <br/>
      Rx, Ry and Rz may be any suitable leaving group, such as lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, or phenyl.
      <br/>
      R1 is defined above.

    <p num="38">
      Compounds of formula (1) wherein R is (12) can be synthesized as depicted in FIG. 3 using R7 --N.dbd.O as the starting compound.
      <br/>
      The polystyrene resin, P, can be functionalized as described in Leznoff and Wong, Can. J. Chem., 51:3756-3764 (1973).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, functionalized resins can be purchased from Novabiochem.
      <br/>
      The reaction (b) in FIG. 3 is called the Mills reaction.
      <br/>
      The selectivity of the hydrolysis in the Mills reaction is determined by the temperature, which should be kept low.
      <br/>
      Glacial acetic acid is used in this step when R7 is aryl.
      <br/>
      However, the acidic conditions must be varied depending on the R7 group, and other solvents and mineral acids are used.
      <br/>
      See March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, page 638 (4th ed. 1992) (John Wiley and Sons) and The Chemistry Of Nitro and Nitroso Groups, part 1, pages 278-283 (1969) (Interscience, New York).
      <br/>
      A modification of this reaction is described in Ayyangar et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 30, 7253 (1989) (starting with 3-N-acylphenyl boronic acid instead of 3-aminophenyl boronic acid).

      Finally, FIGS. 4A-B are diagrams of methods of synthesizing compounds of formula (1) wherein R is (11).

      In FIG. 4A, the reaction is preferably carried out using the free boronic acid as shown in FIG. 4A. However, functionalized resins can be used, as illustrated in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The use of such resins reduces the risk of secondary reactions due to steric hindrance.
      <br/>
      However, if the resin is used, the second step (reducing the diazonium salt to the hydrazine) will result in cleavage from the resin.
      <br/>
      In either case, the boronic acid can provide the acidic conditions for the reaction.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4B, U is H, CH3 or R9 CH2 COY.

    <p num="40">
      The compounds of formula (1) may contain an acidic or basic functional group and are, thus, capable of forming pharmaceutically-acceptable salts with pharmaceutically-acceptable acids and bases.
      <br/>
      The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable salts" in these instances refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid and base addition salts of compounds of formula (1).
      <br/>
      These salts can be prepared by reacting the purified compound with a suitable acid or base.
      <br/>
      Suitable bases include the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically-acceptable metal cation, ammonia, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine.
      <br/>
      Representative alkali or alkaline earth salts include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts and the like.
      <br/>
      Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine and the like.
      <br/>
      Representative acid addition salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, napthalate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate, and laurylsulphonate salts and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The compounds of formula (1), and the pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, are inhibitors of  BETA -lactamases.
      <br/>
      Further, the compounds of formula (1) appear to prevent the transcriptional up-regulation of  BETA -lactamases.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      As discussed in the Background, it has previously been reported that boric acid and certain boronic acids are inhibitors of certain  BETA -lactamases.
      <br/>
      These inhibitors are different than the inhibitors of the invention defined by formula (1).
      <br/>
      Moreover, many of the compounds of formula (1) are much more effective inhibitors of  BETA -lactamases than the prior art inhibitors (see the Examples below).
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Assays for the inhibition of  BETA -lactamase activity are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      For instance, the ability of a compound to inhibit  BETA -lactamase activity in a standard enzyme inhibition assay may be used (see, e.g., Example 2 below and M. G. Page, Biochem J. 295 (Pt. 1) 295-304 (1993)).  BETA -lactamases for use in such assays may be purified from bacterial sources or, preferably, are produced by recombinant DNA techniques, since genes and cDNA clones coding for many  BETA -lactamases are known.
      <br/>
      See, e.g., S. J. Cartwright and S. G. Waley, Biochem J. 221, 505-512 (1984).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the sensitivity of bacteria known, or engineered, to produce a  BETA -lactamase to an inhibitor may be determined (see Example 3 below).
      <br/>
      Other bacterial inhibition assays include agar disk diffusion and agar dilution.
      <br/>
      See, e.g., W. H. Traub &amp; B. Leonhard, Chemotherapy 43, 159-167 (1997).
      <br/>
      Inhibition includes both reduction and elimination of  BETA -lactamase activity.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The compounds of formula (1) are also effective against bacteria resistant to  BETA -lactam antibiotics as a result of porin mutations (see, e.g., Example 5 below).
      <br/>
      Porin mutations are mutations in the proteins which form porin channels in bacterial cell walls.
      <br/>
      These mutations reduce the ability of  BETA -lactam antibiotics to enter bacterial cells in which the mutations occur, thereby making the bacteria resitant to these antibiotics.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The compounds of formula (1), or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, can be used to treat  BETA -lactam-antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. " BETA -lactam-antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection" is used herein to refer to an infection caused by bacteria resistant to treatment with  BETA -lactam antibiotics due primarily to the action of a  BETA -lactamase, a porin mutation, or both.
      <br/>
      Resistance to  BETA -lactam antibiotics can be determined by standard antibiotic sensitivity testing.
      <br/>
      The presence of  BETA -lactamase activity can be determined as is well known in the art (see above).
      <br/>
      The presence of a porin mutation can be detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis of porin genes, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of a preparation obtained by mild osmotic shock (e.g., treatment with hypotonic solution containing EDTA, followed by gentle centrifugation and separation of the supernatant) of the bacteria (absence of a protein of the appropriate molecular weight being indicative of a porin mutation), or by determining resistance to infection by bacteriophage TulA (a standard test for OmpF- porin mutations).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, and preferably, the sensitivity of a particular bacterium to the combination of a compound of formula (1), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, and a  BETA -lactam antibiotic can be determined by standard antibiotic sensitivity testing methods.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      To treat a  BETA -lactam resistant bacterial infection, an animal suffering from such an infection is given an effective amount of a compound of formula (1), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, and an effective amount of a  BETA -lactam antibiotic.
      <br/>
      The compound of formula (1), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, and the antibiotic may be given separately or together.
      <br/>
      When administered together, they may be contained in separate pharmaceutical compositions or may be in the same pharmaceutical composition.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Many suitable  BETA -lactam antibiotics are known.
      <br/>
      These include cephalosporins (e.g., cephalothin), penicillins (e.g., amoxicillin), monobactams (e.g., aztreonam), carbapenems (e.g., imipenem), carbacephems (loracarbef), and others.  BETA -lactam antibiotics are effective (in the absence of resistance) against a wide range of bacterial infections.
      <br/>
      These include those caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, for example, bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus (such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis), Streptococcus (such as Streptococcus agalactine, Streptococcus penumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis), Micrococcus (such as Micrococcus luteus), Bacillus (such as Bacillus subtilis), Listerella (such as Listerella monocytogenes), Escherichia (such as Escherichia coli), Klebsiella (such as Klebsiella pneumoniae), Proteus (such as Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris), Salmonella (such as Salmonella typhosa), Shigella (such as Shigella sonnei), Enterobacter (such as Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter facium), Serratia (such as Serratia marcescens), Pseudomonas (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa), Acinetobacter such as Acinetobacter anitratus), Nocardia (such as Nocardia autotrophica), and Mycobacterium (such as Mycobacterium fortuitum).
      <br/>
      Effective doses and modes of administration of  BETA -lactam antibiotics are known in the art or may be determined empirically as described below for the compounds of formula (1).
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      It has also been found that the compounds of formula (1), or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, are antibacterial by themselves, although at higher concentrations than  BETA -lactam antibiotics.
      <br/>
      Indeed, they have shown activity against  BETA -lactam-antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
      <br/>
      Although not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that this antibacterial activity is due to the binding of the inhibitors to PBPs which resemble  BETA -lactamases.
      <br/>
      Since PBPs are found in all bacterial species susceptible to  BETA -lactam antibiotics, it is expected that the compounds of formula (1), or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, will be effective against the same bacteria as the  BETA -lactam antibiotics (see above).
      <br/>
      As with the  BETA -lactam antibiotics, sensitivity of bacteria to the compounds of formula (1), or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, can be determined by standard antibiotic sensitivity testing.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      To treat an animal suffering from a bacterial infection, including  BETA -lactam-antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, an effective amount of a compound of formula (1), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, is administered to the animal, alone or in combination with a  BETA -lactam antibiotic.
      <br/>
      Effective dosage forms, modes of administration and dosage amounts of a compound of formula (1), may be determined empirically, and making such determinations is within the skill of the art.
      <br/>
      It is understood by those skilled in the art that the dosage amount will vary with the activity of the particular compound employed, the severity of the bacterial infection, whether the bacterial infection is resistant to treatment with  BETA -lactam antibiotics, the route of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of the treatment, the identity of any other drugs being administered to the animal, the age, size and species of the animal, and like factors well known in the medical and veterinary arts.
      <br/>
      In general, a suitable daily dose will be that amount which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect.
      <br/>
      The total daily dosage will be determined by an attending physician or veterinarian within the scope of sound medical judgment.
      <br/>
      If desired, the effective daily dose of a compound of formula (1), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses, administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day.
      <br/>
      Treatment of a bacterial infection, including  BETA -lactam-antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, according to the invention, includes mitigation, as well as elimination, of the infection.

      While it is possible for the active ingredient(s) (one or more compounds of formula (1), or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, alone or in combination with a  BETA -lactam antibiotic) to be administered alone, it is preferable to administer the active ingredient(s) as a pharmaceutical formulation (composition).
      <br/>
      The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise the active ingredient(s) in admixture with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and, optionally, with one or more other compounds, drugs or other materials.

      Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of the active ingredient(s) to the body.

      Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving, dispersing or otherwise incorporating the active ingredient(s) in a proper medium, such as an elastomeric matrix material.
      <br/>
      Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the active ingredient(s) across the skin.

      It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like in the compositions.
      <br/>
      In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the active ingredient(s), it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.
      <br/>
      This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility.
      <br/>
      The rate of absorption of the active ingredient(s) then depends upon its/their rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, delayed absorption of parenterally-administered active ingredient(s) is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the active ingredient(s) in an oil vehicle.

    <p num="72">
      Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the active ingredient(s) in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide.

      Depending on the ratio of the active ingredient(s) to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of release of the active ingredient(s) can be controlled.
      <br/>
      Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides).
      <br/>
      Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the active ingredient(s) in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue.

    <p num="76">Identification of Potential  BETA -Lactamase Inhibitors</p>
    <p num="77">
      To target sites on the E. coli TEM-1 and AmpC  BETA -lactamases to which novel inhibitors might bind, the structures of certain enzyme-inhibitor complexes were determined.
      <br/>
      These structures and other known structures of enzyme-inhibitor and enzyme-substrate complexes were used to define the binding sites of the enzymes.
      <br/>
      Additional potential binding sites on AmpC were identified using computational methods.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      TEM-1 and AmpC were chosen because, as discussed above, these two  BETA -lactamases are responsible for resistance to  BETA -lactam antibiotics in E. coli, and the versions of TEM and AmpC in other bacterial species share high sequence identity and are structurally similar to TEM-1 and AmpC from E. coli.
      <br/>
      The high degree of species similarity among the TEM and AmpC  BETA -lactamases suggests that inhibitors discovered for the E. coli enzymes will be active against Types I and II  BETA -lactamases in other bacterial species.
      <br/>
      This is consistent with the antimicrobial data presented below which show that the boronic acid derivatives of the invention are active against bacteria expressing several different type I and type II TEM-1  BETA -lactamases (e.g., the AmpC-like enzyme expressed by Enterobacter cloacae).

      DNA coding for the enzyme was located on a plasmid under the control of a temperature sensitive repressor.
      <br/>
      Cells containing this plasmid were grown in 2 liters of LB broth in a fermentor to log phase.
      <br/>
      Enzyme expression was then induced by temperature shock (heating from 37 (degree)  C. to 41 (degree)  C.), and the cells were allowed to grow overnight.
      <br/>
      AmpC protein was purified from the supernatant over an Affigel-10 aminophenyl boronate affinity column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1000 Alfred Nobel Drive, Hercules, Calif.).
      <br/>
      The enzyme was eluted with 0.5 M boric acid, pH 7.0, and the boric acid was subsequently removed from the enzyme preparation by dialysis against 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The purity of the sample was estimated by HPLC to be 96% or better.

      The amount of enzyme produced was estimated to be 150 mg based on absorbance at 280 nm.

      Protein crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion using a hanging drop method.

      The concentration of protein in the drops was 3-6 mg/ml, and the concentration of the boronic acid inhibitor was 1-10 mM.

      The structure of the MAPB-AmpC complex showed several unexpected interactions.
      <br/>
      Most surprisingly, the putative "oxyanion" of the boronic acid appeared to form a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ala318.
      <br/>
      Clear electron density connected the O GAMMA  of the catalytic Ser64 to the boron atom of the boronic acid, suggesting a covalent bond.
      <br/>
      Atoms within hydrogen-bonding distance of MAPB included the N of Ser64 and the N and O atoms of Ala318, which interact with one of the boronic oxygens (O1).
      <br/>
      An apparent hydrogen bond was also observed between the meta-amino a group of MAPB and the Asn346 side chain.
      <br/>
      The O GAMMA  of Thr316 and the hydroxyl of Tyr150 appeared to make a dipole-quadrupole interactions with the phenyl ring.
      <br/>
      There were also nonpolar contacts between the rings of MAPB and Tyr 150.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      A refined structure of BZBTH2B (2Fo-Fc electron density) showed the inhibitor covalently connected to Ser64.
      <br/>
      The density clearly defined the orientation of this compound in the binding site.
      <br/>
      The crystallographic statistics were good (R-factor 0.179, Rfree 0.229), and all bond and angle values fell within the allowed deviations for a well-refined structure.
      <br/>
      A similar refined structure of 3NPB (2Fo-Fc electron density) showed that this inhibitor was also covalently connected to Ser64.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows key active site residues of the enzyme environment around BZBTH2B.
      <br/>
      Residues displayed were typically within 5 angstroms of BZBTH2B, with the exception of Arg349 and Asn346.
      <br/>
      These last two residues are nevertheless part of a polar network that interacts with the O2 hydroxyl of BZBTH2B through two well-defined water molecules (small spheres).
      <br/>
      The dotted lines indicate hydrogen bond interactions, with atoms within 2.6-3.2 angstroms of each other.
      <br/>
      Prominent among them is a hydrogen bond between the boronic acid O2 atom and Tyr150.
      <br/>
      The boronic acid O1 hydrogen bonds with the "oxyanion hole" backbone nitrogens of Ser64 and Ala318 and with the carbonyl oxygen of Ala318.
      <br/>
      The inhibitor also appeared to form quadrupole-quadrupole interactions with Tyr221 and quadrupole-dipole interactions with Asn152.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, these interactions occur in a region of the  BETA -lactamase that is thought to be specific for the amide group of the R1 side chain of  BETA -lactams.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the BZBTH2B-AmpC complex, the benzothiophene ring has replaced the amide group of the  BETA -lactam side chain.

    <p num="86">
      Using the binding sites defined as described above, other boronic acids were identified as potential inhibitors of  BETA -lactamase. 2-Phenylboronic acid, MAPB, thiophene-2-boronic acid (TH2B), 3NPB, and 4,4'-biphenyldiboronic acid (BIPD) were selected as a representative sample of commercially-available boronic acids for modeling into the AmpC active site.
      <br/>
      Structures and conformational libraries for each compound were created using the Sybyl molecular modeling suite (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, Mo.).
      <br/>
      No internal energy evaluation was performed, and all van der Waals radii were set to 0.5. Only conformers that placed one of the two boronic acid oxygen atoms near (2.4-3.4 anstrom range) the nitrogens of the putative hydroxyl/oxyanion hole (backbone N atoms of Ser64 and Ala318) were scored.
      <br/>
      Two separate systematic searches, one for each boronic acid oxygen atom involved in the distance constraints, were performed for each compound.
      <br/>
      Initial scoring was performed using the DOCK accessory program SCOREOPT2 based on steric criteria from the DISTMAP program (Shoichet, B. K.; Bodian, D. L.; Kuntz, I. D., J. Comp.

      In one "MAPB-like" mode, the boronic acid ligand is oriented similarly to the inhibitor in the MAPB-AmpC structure and is predicted to interact with residues Thr316, Asn346, and Asn289.
      <br/>
      In a second "phosphonate-like" mode, the boronic acid ligand is oriented similarly to the phosphonate ligand in an AmpC-inhibitor complex determined by Lobkovsky, et al. (Lobkovsky, E.; Billings, E. M.; Moews, P. C.; Rahil, J.; Pratt, R. F.; Knox, J. R. Biochemistry, 33, 6762-6772 (1994)) and is predicted to interact with residues Asn152 and Gln120.
      <br/>
      The distribution of orientations in the two modes was generally correlated with the size of the boronic acid ligand, with larger ligands favoring the "phosphonate-like" mode because of steric clashes with the receptor in the "MAPB-like" mode.
      <br/>
      Ligands such as TH2B, which might bind in an "MAPB-like" conformation, would be expected to have specific interactions with features of the AmpC binding site that might improve their potency relative to AmpC.
      <br/>
      Larger ligands, such as BZBTH2B, were expected to bind in the "phosphonate-like" geometry.
      <br/>
      In this latter geometry, ligands such as BZBTH2B and 3NPB would be expected to interact with Gln120, Asn152 and Tyr150.
      <br/>
      The geometries of BZBTH2B and 3NPB in complex with AmpC, determined by x-ray crystallography, were consistent with these predictions (see above).

      Structural modeling was followed by testing for inhibition of enzyme activity and antibacterial activity.
      <br/>
      This was followed by further modeling and testing of additional compounds.
      <br/>
      For testing results, see Examples 2-5.
      <br/>
      This cycle of structural modeling, enzymatic testing and antibacterial evaluation led to the following observations.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      An intriguing feature of the MAPB--AmpC complex is how few obviously favorable interactions are observed between the aryl group of the inhibitor and the enzyme.
      <br/>
      Still, MAPB has a Ki of 7.3.+- 0 (slashed zero) 9  MU M for AmpC.
      <br/>
      One possible explanation for the affinity of MAPB is that the binding of the compound is driven by ligand hydrophobicity.
      <br/>
      To test this, the inhibition of several other hydrophobic boronic acids was measured.
      <br/>
      Both 1-naphthyl- and 9-phenanthrene-boronic acids have two to three-fold worse (higher) dissociation constraints than MAPB.
      <br/>
      These ligands are larger than MAPB, so the effect of hydrophobicity may be complicated by steric constraints. 2-naphthylboronic acid has an affinity (Ki =8.5 +- 1.8  MU M) comparable to MAPB, suggesting that the presence of a larger hydrophobic substituent in the right orientation does not hinder binding.
      <br/>
      Certainly for diphenylboronic acid, which lacks measurable inhibition of AmpC, modeling suggests potential steric conflicts with residues Tyr150 and Lys67.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the smaller and more flexible n-butylboronic acid should have little difficulty fitting into the AmpC site, and yet it also displays no measurable inhibition of AmpC.
      <br/>
      Taken together, these results suggest that boronic acids must have the correct stereochemical arrangement of functionality; hydrophobicity alone is not sufficient to explain affinity.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The differential affinities of the boronic acids for AmpC might be due to activation of the boronic acid group as an electrophile by substituents on the aryl ring.
      <br/>
      The affinities of 2-formyl- and 4-formyl-phenylboronic acids, and those of 3-trifluoro- and 4-trifluoro-phenylboronic acids were compared.
      <br/>
      If affinity was modulated mostly by effects on electrophilicity of the boronic acid group, one might expect electron withdrawing groups at the 2 and 4 positions to be about equal activators, but both to be better than similar groups at the 3 position.
      <br/>
      Instead, it was found that derivatives at the 3 position were more active than ones at 4, and that groups at 2 are much less active than either derivatives at 3 or 4.
      <br/>
      This is consistent with the steric constraints around the 2 position of MAPB and the polar environment around position 3 in the "MAPB-like" orientation.
      <br/>
      It was also found that the (S) and (R) stereoisomers of 3-tetrahydrofuranyl boronic acid differ in affinity for AmpC by an order of magnitude.
      <br/>
      This can only be explained by differential non-covalent interactions with the enzyme, perhaps with the nearby Thr316 residue if these ligands assume a "MAPB-like" binding mode.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      Perturbations that maintained the overall steric disposition of MAPB, but changed its functionality, were next considered.
      <br/>
      In the case of a "MAPB-like" binding mode, hydrogen-bonding groups from Asn289, Asn346, and Arg349 are in proximity to potential ring substituents at the 3- and 4-positions of a MAPB-like compound.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if the boronic acid ligand binds in a "phosphonate-like" orientation, hydrogen-bonding groups from Gln120 and Asn152 lie nearby.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that, with the many approximations used in the boronic acid-based ligand modeling (no allowance for enzyme flexibility, simplistic modeling of ligand electrostatic properties, etc.), these results should only be used as a guide.
      <br/>
      In the case of either binding mode, it seemed reasonable to look for ligand functionality that could be involved in hydrogen bonds with, or at least offer polar complements to, these nearby residues.
      <br/>
      Consistent with these structural considerations, the Ki values of the 3-nitro-, and 3-trifluoro derivatives of phenylboronic acid are in the one to two micromolar range, three- to five-fold better than MAPB.
      <br/>
      However, the 3-carboxy derivative of phenylboronic acid does not display significant affinity for AmpC (Ki &gt;100  MU M).
      <br/>
      This suggests that this compound cannot bind to AmpC in a manner that allows interaction between the m-substituent of the inhibitor and the Arg349 residue of the enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Three regions of the enzyme were of particular interest.
      <br/>
      Assuming a "MAPB-like" binding mode for boronic acid-based ligands, a "canyon" was noted near position 3 of the MAPB ring in the crystallographic complex.
      <br/>
      In addition, a large hydrophilic tunnel, about 15  Angstrom  in length, was noted near the 4-position of MAPB in the crystallographic complex that ran through the surface of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if, as the modeling results suggest, a potential boronic acid ligand may also adopt a "phosphonate-like" binding orientation, the pocket defined by residues Ala318, Tyr221, Gln120, and Asn152 offers the potential for increasing ligand interactions with the target site by changing ligand functionality.
      <br/>
      These residues are thought to be involved in recognition of the R1 sidechains of  BETA -lactams antibiotics.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      The largest 3-derivative tested was NSULFB (Ki =1.3.+- 0 (slashed zero) 1  MU M), and it seems likely to bind in a "phosphonate-like" manner.
      <br/>
      Several smaller 3-derivatives were also best accommodated in this binding orientation.
      <br/>
      For instance, MAPB analogs such as m-nitrophenylboronic acid (3NPB), m-trifluoromethylphenylboronic acid(3TFMB), m-carboxyvinylphenylboronic acid (3CVPB), and m-carboxyphenylboronic acid (3CPB) seem unlikely to bind to AmpC in a "MAPB-like" manner due to steric conflicts with the enzyme.
      <br/>
      However, each should be able to bind in a "phosphonate-like" manner and this binding mode appears to be consistent with the structure-activity relationships observed for these compounds.
      <br/>
      Thus, the m-trifluoromethyl substituent of 3TFMB (Ki =1.1.+- 0 (slashed zero) 3  MU M) appears to fit snugly into the hydrophobic pocket created by Leu119 and Leu293 and the m-nitro group of 3NPB (Ki =1.7  MU M), adopting a slightly different "phosphonate-like" orientation, should be able to interact with Asn152.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the poor activity observed for 3CPB (Ki &gt;&gt;100  MU M) may be due to the lack of nearby Arg or Lys residues to effectively complement its charged carboxylate group.
      <br/>
      The better affinity of the m-carboxyvinyl derivative 3CVPB (Ki =5.9.+- 0 (slashed zero) 3  MU M) relative to its smaller m-carboxy analog 3CPB may be due to the ability of the larger compound to form interactions with more distant residues, such as Gln120, not accessible to 3CPB.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      Assumption of a "phosphonate-like" binding mode would also help explain the activity of many of the p-substituted arylboronic acids studied.
      <br/>
      The region of AmpC which includes residues Ala318, Tyr221, Gln120, and Asn152 is much less sterically restricted than the MAPB binding site and has a variety of functional groups present for potential ligand-receptor interactions.
      <br/>
      This may explain why, in general, p-substituted arylboronic acids are effective AmpC inhibitors.
      <br/>
      A variety of p-substituents are tolerated by AmpC, including carboxy (Ki =2.9.+- 0 (slashed zero) 3  MU M), formyl (Ki =2.9.+- 0 (slashed zero) 9  MU M), trifluoromethyl (Ki =3 0 (slashed zero) +- 0 (slashed zero) 5  MU M), carboxyvinyl (Ki =4.2 +- 1.1  MU M), and boronic acid (Ki =3.9.+- 0 (slashed zero) 2  MU M) groups, with each improving affinity relative to the parent phenylboronic acid (Ki =10.5 +- 2.6  MU M).
      <br/>
      Even larger p-substituents, such as those present in the biphenyl (Ki =0.2.+- 0 (slashed zero) 03  MU M), 2-naphthyl (Ki =8.5 +- 1.8  MU M), and 5-indolyl (Ki =10.9.+- 0 (slashed zero) 6  MU M) compounds are tolerated in this binding mode.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Surprisingly, the 4,4'-biphenyldiboronic acid analog inhibits AmpC potently, with a Ki of 0.18.+- 0 (slashed zero) 02  MU M. Although this derivative may be modeled to fit near the mouth of the tunnel region of AmpC noted earlier, it cannot do so without accommodation on the part of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      If the same mode of binding as MAPB is assumed, without enzyme relaxation, this inhibitor would come into close contact with Ser287, Asp288, Asn289, and Asn346.
      <br/>
      Although modeling results suggest other conformations are possible, none of them make interactions that clearly explain the affinity of this compound.
      <br/>
      The most conservative explanation is that the 4,4'-biphenyldiboronic acid analog maintains the overall disposition of groups suggested by the MAPB-E. coli complex.
      <br/>
      This would lead to interactions with the mouth of the tunnel region, including residues such as Ala292.
      <br/>
      However, in order to do so, residues Asn346 and Ser287 would have to move slightly away from the ligand.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      The proximity of the hydroxyl groups of Tyr150 and Thr316 to ring atoms of MAPB in the crystallogrphic complex suggested that polar or polarizable atoms at positions 2 or 3 might better complement the enzyme than the phenyl ring of MAPB.
      <br/>
      Consistent with this view, thiophene-2-boronic acid was found to have a Ki of 2.5.+- 0 (slashed zero) 4  MU M against AmpC, and (R)-3-tetrahydrofuranyl-boronic acid was found to have a Ki of 1.4.+- 0 (slashed zero) 1  MU M. The thiopene-3-boronic acid, which should be unable to accept a hydrogen bond from Tyr150 in a "MAPB-like" binding orientation, has a much worse affinity for AmpC (Ki =22.1 +- 3.5  MU M).
      <br/>
      The (S)-3-tetrahydrofuranylboronic acid, the heteroatom of which, in a "MAPB-like" binding orientation should be unable to interact with Thr316, has a Ki of 15.8.+- 0 (slashed zero) 8  MU M. On the other hand, the poor affinity of 2-furanylboronic acid (Ki &gt;&gt;100  MU M), which, like the 2-thiophene derivative, should be able to accept a hydrogen bond from Tyr150, is difficult to explain simply based on hydrogen bonding considerations.
      <br/>
      The differential activity of the 2-thiophene derivative relative to the 2-furanyl derivative might reflect subtle differences in polarity and polarizability of an aryl sulfur versus an aryl oxygen.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the difference in activities might reflect the different shapes of the molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      It was also considered that substitutions, including the presence of larger heteroaryl groups, might improve the potency of TH2B.
      <br/>
      Modeling suggested that although ligands containing larger systems like benzo�b�heteroarylboronic acids probably would not fit into the AmpC site in a "MAPB-like" binding mode (based on orientation distributions and assuming no accommodation on the part of the enzyme), these compounds should still be able to bind to the enzyme in other productive orientations.
      <br/>
      Several derivatives of TH2B were tested, the most potent of which was benzo�b�thiophene-2-boronic acid.
      <br/>
      This compound has a Ki of 27 nM for AmpC.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Benzo�b�thiophene-2-boronic acid is approximately 200-fold more active than thiophene-2-boronic acid, suggesting that interactions with the second aryl ring contribute considerably to affinity.
      <br/>
      This inference is supported by the activity of benzo�b�furan-2-boronic acid, which is about 1000-fold more active than the furan-2-boronic acid parent.
      <br/>
      At the same time, a comparison of the activity of BZBTH2B with 2-naphthylboronic acid (Ki =8.5 +- 1.8  MU M), which should place its distal aryl ring in approximately the same area as the benzo�b�thiophene derivative, confirms the importance of the thiophene ring.
      <br/>
      Model building suggests that BZBTH2B may bind to AmpC in the pocket defined by residues Gln120, Asn152, and Tyr218.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      The wide variety of chemical functionality present in the boronic acid compounds tested has allowed mapping of the AmpC binding site and suggested modifications to improve the potency of the agents tested.
      <br/>
      Modeling of these inhibitors suggests that they may be interacting with the enzyme in ways unanticipated by earlier classes of inhibitors.
      <br/>
      At the same time, it must be admitted that such modeling carries with it some ambiguity and key questions regarding the structural bases for activity remain unanswered.

      The cells are spun down and the supernatant, into which the enzyme has been exported, is collected.

      Initial stock solutions of 1-100 mM concentrations of each compound to be tested were prepared in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide).
      <br/>
      Solubility and absorbance profiles were determined by incremental addition of small volumes of DMSO stock solutions to assay buffer (50 mM phosphate, pH 7.0) at 25 (degree)  C. using an HP8543 UV/Visible spectrophotometer with multi-cell transport running HP ChemStation software (version 2.5).
      <br/>
      Enzymatic testing was typically started at an upper concentration limit determined by the solubility and absorbance profile of the compound.

    <p num="105">
      Standard assay conditions for AmpC were as follows: pH 7.0; 100  MU M cephalothin, sodium salt, as substrate; reaction monitored at 265 nm (cephalothin  BETA -lactam absorbance peak); T=25 (degree)  C.; 50 mM phosphate buffer; no incubation of inhibitor with enzyme; cycle times of 10-15 seconds; total reaction volume=1 mL; run time=5 minutes; reaction initialized with addition of 0.06 nM AmpC. The background rate of cephalothin hydrolysis under these conditions was found to be two to three orders of magnitude less than the rate of the enzyme-mediated cephalothin hydrolysis, so no correction for background hydrolysis of substrate was used.
      <br/>
      For TEM-1, 100  MU M 6- BETA -furylacryloylamidopenicillanic acid, triethylammonium salt (FAP), was used as the substrate, the reaction was monitored at 340 nm (FAP  BETA -lactam absorbance peak) and the cycle time was increased to 25 seconds (since this substrate was somewhat light sensitive).
      <br/>
      Due to the light sensitivity of FAP, the background rate of hydrolysis for this substrate was found to be minimal, but not insignificant, so all measured control and inhibited cell rates were corrected by subtraction of the FAP background rate.

      The following strains were used: Enterobacter cloacae cell line with derepressed  BETA -lactamase production (Ent-Der), and Escherichia coli RYC1000 (araD139 D lacU169 rpsL D rib7 thiA gyrA recA56) cell lines, harboring the plasmid pBGS19 (with no  BETA -lactamase), or the  BETA -lactamase containing plasmids pBGAmpC (AmpC  BETA -lactamase from E. coli; Eco-AmpC), or pBGAmpC-MHN (AmpC  BETA -lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae; Eco-AmpCEnt).
      <br/>
      Plasmids pBGAmp-MHN and pBGAmpC were constructed by PCR amplification of the respective E. cloacae and E. coli chromosomal ampC genes and subsequent cloning into pBGS18 (Spratt, B. G.; Hedge, P. I.; Heesen, S.; Edelman, A.; Broome-Smith, J. K. Gene 41, 337-342 (1986)).
      <br/>
      TEM-10 and TEM-24 are mutants of TEM-1.
      <br/>
      TEM-10 and TEM-24 differ from TEM-1 due to the following point substitutions: TEM-10 (R164S, E240K); TEM-24 (L102K, L162S, S235T, A237K).
      <br/>
      TEM-10 and TEM-24 also differ from TEM-1 in being extended spectrum enzymes (i.e., they react with a greater range of substrates than TEM-1).
      <br/>
      Also tested were clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
      <br/>
      All bacterial strains and plasmids are available from Jesus Blazquez and Fernando Baquero, Servicio de Microbiologia, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, National Institute of Health, Madrid, Spain.

      After 2 minutes, a solution of 1-naphthol or 2-naphthol (1 eq, 0.73 mmol; purchased from Aldrich and Fluka) in 10% aqueous NaOH was added dropwise with vigorous stirring to the suspension, which was kept overnight at 0 (degree)  C. After filtration of the mixture, a red precipitate was obtained and characterized by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (eluent-CHCl3 /CH3 OH, 9:1) and NMR spectroscopy.
