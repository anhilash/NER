      <br/>
      In order to extend the measuring range and to reduce the Hook effect in an immunological method of determination of an antigen based on the principle of a sandwich assay it is preferable to use a method which is characterized in that the labelled detection molecule is an oligomer of a binding molecule selected from antibody or/and antibody fragment.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention concerns a method for the immunological determination of an analyte according to the sandwich assay principle and suitable binding substances for this.
      <br/>
      In particular the invention concerns an improvement of such sandwich methods in order to extend the measuring range and to reduce the Hook effect.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The quantitative determination of antigenic substances by means of immunoassays is known.
      <br/>
      A so-called sandwich assay is often used for this in which two antibodies directed towards the same or different epitopes of the analyte are incubated with a sample containing an analyte to be determined.
      <br/>
      In this method a first soluble antibody is directly or indirectly coupled to a signal-generating system i.e. a label whereas a second antibody (in a heterogeneous assay) is present coupled to a solid phase or is provided with a binding component such as e.g. biotin which is capable of binding to an appropriately coated solid phase.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The concentration of a number of diagnostically important proteins can vary within a wide range which means a wide measuring range is desirable or even essential for the analytics.
      <br/>
      Examples of such proteins are e.g. cancer parameters such as  ALPHA  fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and also the pregnancy protein human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG).
      <br/>
      When determining such analytes it is diagnostically important on the one hand to obtain an exact value in high concentration ranges in order to be able to carry out a successful monitoring but on the other hand it must also be possible to carry out an exact determination in the lower concentration range for a qualitatively correct diagnosis (yes/no) which in turn can lead to fundamental therapeutic consequences.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A problem with high analyte concentrations in a sample to be examined is the so-called "Hook effect" which is understood as a decrease of the detectable signal at very high analyte concentrations.
      <br/>
      The reason for this is that normally in a heterogeneous sandwich assay format the soluble antibody and the solid phase antibody are present in an excess relative to the analyte to be determined so that the sandwich complexes can be formed and also detected essentially completely; however, in the case of a high analyte concentration a limited number of antibodies is faced by a very large number of analyte molecules.
      <br/>
      In the extreme case there is a deficit of solid phase antibody so that the analyte is only partially bound and moreover the fraction of analyte bound to the solid phase cannot be completely detected since labelled antibody is captured by the excess of analyte with formation of soluble detection antibodies: analyte complexes.
      <br/>
      This results in a reduction of the measured signal which can lead to a false negative test result.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      One solution to the problem is of course to adequately dilute the sample to be examined.
      <br/>
      However, since in practice it is not known from the start when and to what extent a dilution has to be carried out, this means that several measurements with different concentrations have to be carried out which is undesirable for reasons of costs and because of the increased amount of work.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A further solution to this problem is to increase the concentration of both antibodies used in the sandwich assay.
      <br/>
      This however, results in a number of disadvantages such as for example additional possibilities of interference, a high blank value and an unfavourable shape of the calibration curve.
      <br/>
      Moreover the costs of each individual determination are also increased so that this possibility can also not be regarded as satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Yet a further solution is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,743,542. This patent teaches that the calibration curve can be linearized at high analyte concentrations by addition of unlabelled first or second antibody or of mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      This lowers the sensitivity in the lower measuring range but increases it at higher analyte concentrations resulting in an overall linearization of the calibration curve.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      However, a disadvantage of the method according to U.S. Pat. No. 4,743,542 is the reduction of the sensitivity in the lower measuring range.
      <br/>
      Such a reduction is particularly critical when an accurate test result is essential in the lower measuring range for example in the HCG test in order to determine whether a pregnancy is present or not.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Hence the object of the invention was to provide a method for the immunological determination of an analyte in which the disadvantages of the state of the art are at least partially eliminated and which in particular enables a quantitatively exact determination over a wide measuring range while at the same time obtaining good results in the lower concentration range.</p>
    <p num="10">This object is achieved according to the invention by a method for the immunological determination of an analyte in a sample liquid according to the principle of a sandwich assay in which the sample liquid is incubated in the presence of a solid phase with at least two receptors capable of binding to the analyte to be determined in which the first receptor is soluble and the second receptor (a) is bound to a solid phase or (b) is capable of binding to a solid phase and the analyte is detected by determining the label in the solid phase or/and in the liquid phase which is characterized in that the first receptor is an oligomer of a binding molecule selected from antibodies, antibody fragments and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="11">
      It has surprisingly turned out that the use of a soluble oligomeric antibody enables the Hook effect to be reduced and hence an extension of the measuring range.
      <br/>
      In general the sensitivity in the lower measuring range is retained or even improved.
      <br/>
      The lower limit of detection LLD according to Kayser (Fresenius "Zeitschrift fur analytische Chemie", volume 209, number 1, page 1-18, 1965) is used in the present description as a measure of the sensitivity in the lower measuring range.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The first receptor used according to the invention is an oligomer of a binding molecule selected from antibodies or/and antibody fragments and for the sake of simplicity is referred to as "oligomeric antibody" in the following.
      <br/>
      The prefix "first" or "second" antibody only serves the purpose of distinction in this description and does not for instance refer to an order of addition etc.
      <br/>
      The term "antibody" in the present invention is understood as an antibody with a single specificity such as a monoclonal antibody as well as a mixture of antibodies which are directed towards different epitopes of the same antigen such as a polyclonal antiserum. "Antibody fragment" is understood as any molecule which is derived from a complete antibody while retaining at least one paratope and which can for example be obtained by enzymatic or chemical treatment of an antibody or by genetic engineering.
      <br/>
      In particular an F(ab')2 fragment is understood as an antibody fragment.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The degree of oligomerization relative to a complete antibody or to an F(ab')2 fragment is at least two i.e. the minimum number of paratopes of an oligomeric antibody according to the invention is four.
      <br/>
      The minimum degree of oligomerization is preferably two to three.
      <br/>
      The maximum degree of oligomerization is up to 15, preferably up to 10 and more preferably up to 8.
      <br/>
      The degree of oligomerization is most preferably 2 to 8 and especially preferably 4 to 6.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The oligomeric first receptor is preferably used in a labelled form in the method according to the invention.
      <br/>
      This means that it is coupled directly or indirectly to a labelling group.
      <br/>
      In this connection a direct coupling is understood as a covalent incorporation of a detectable substance or of a molecule which on reaction with a suitable substrate generates a detectable substance.
      <br/>
      An example of the latter would be for example an enzyme which is covalently bound to the receptor optionally via a spacer.
      <br/>
      An indirect coupling denotes a configuration in which the first receptor according to the present invention and a detectable substance or a molecule that generates such a substance are capable of binding to one another via a specific binding pair such as biotin/avidin.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The labelling group in the method according to the invention can be selected from known labels in the state of the art.
      <br/>
      Examples are radiolabels and enzyme labels or luminescent labels.
      <br/>
      Preferred examples of enzyme labels are e.g. alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase and galactosidase.
      <br/>
      Preferred as luminescent labels are photoproteins that can be activated by calcium such as aequorin and electrochemiluminescent labels.
      <br/>
      Labels in which the determination is by means of a luminescent reaction are especially preferred and a luminescent metal chelate labelling group is most preferred as the labelling group.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Luminescent metal chelates are metal chelates which generate a detectable luminescence reaction.
      <br/>
      The detection of this luminescence reaction can for example be by measurement of fluorescence or by electrochemi-luminescence.
      <br/>
      The metal of these metal chelates is for example a transition metal or a rare earth metal.
      <br/>
      The metal is preferably ruthenium, osmium, rhenium, iridium, rhodium, platinum, indium, palladium, molybdenum, technetium, copper, chromium or tungsten.
      <br/>
      Ruthenium, rhenium, iridium and osmium are particularly preferred and ruthenium is most preferred.

    <p num="17">
      The ligands which form the metal chelate together with the metal are usually polydentate ligands i.e. ligands with several coordination positions.
      <br/>
      Polydentate ligands for example comprise aromatic and aliphatic ligands.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Suitable aromatic polydentate ligands include aromatic heterocyclic ligands.
      <br/>
      Preferred heterocyclic ligands are N-containing polyheterocycles such as e.g. bipyrididyl, bipyrazyl, terpyridyl and phenanthrolyl.
      <br/>
      These ligands can for example contain substituents such as alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, carboxylate, carboxyaldehyde, carboxamide, cyano, amino, hydroxy, imino, hydroxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, amidine, guanidinium, ureide, groups containing sulphur, groups containing phosphorus and the carboxylate esters of N-hydroxysuccinimide.
      <br/>
      The chelate can also contain one or several monodentate ligands.
      <br/>
      Examples of monodentate ligands include carbon monoxide, cyanides, isocyanides, halogenides and aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic phosphines, amines, stilbenes and arsines.

    <p num="19">
      The luminescent metal chelate is particularly preferably selected from metal chelates containing bipyridyl or phenanthrolyl ligands.

      Examples of suitable metal chelates and the production thereof are described in EP-A-0 178 450, EP-A-0 255 534, EP-A-0 580 979 and WO 90/05301.

      Reference is hereby made to this disclosure.
      <br/>
      The most preferred metal chelates are ruthenium-(bipyridyl)3 chelates.

    <p num="20">
      The labelled receptor used in the method according to the invention contains one or several labelling groups.
      <br/>
      If several labelling groups are used per molecule of the first oligomeric receptor, it is preferred that the number of labelling groups is 2 to 20 and more preferably more than 2 to 10.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The second receptor used in the method according to the invention is bound to the solid phase or capable of binding to it.
      <br/>
      The term "bound to the solid phase" is understood in this description as an immobilization that takes place before the assay by attachment to a macromolecular carrier such as by adsorption, covalent binding or by means of a specific binding pair.
      <br/>
      Accordingly the term "capable of binding" is understood as an immobilization during the assay by means of the specific interaction of a suitable specific binding pair such as biotin/avidin.
      <br/>
      The second receptor is preferably coupled to the solid phase by means of a specific binding pair.
      <br/>
      The second receptor is particularly preferably biotinylated and the solid phase is coated with avidin or/and streptavidin.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The type of the second receptor is not particularly critical in the method of the present invention and hence the second receptor can be selected from a number of molecules provided that they can specifically bind to the analyte to be determined.
      <br/>
      Examples of substances which are suitable for use as a second receptor are for example oligomeric antibodies within the sense of this invention, antibodies, antibody fragments, cell receptors, enzymes, nucleic acids and other substances which due to a particular spatial structure or chemical affinity are capable of binding the analyte to be determined.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Depending on the exact experimental design conventional solid phases are used as the solid phase in the method according to the invention.
      <br/>
      These for example comprise finely dispersed materials such as polystyrene beads or particulate magnetic material and in general surfaces of reaction vessels such as the wall of a cuvette or a microtitre plate and for special applications chips, sensors or membranes.
      <br/>
      In the presently preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention the solid phase is particulate magnetic material which contains a coating capable of binding to the second receptor.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The exact procedure for the method according to the invention corresponds to known protocols of sandwich assays and is familiar to a person skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      In general a sample containing an analyte to be determined is incubated under suitable conditions and for an adequate time period with a first receptor, second receptor and solid phase in an arbitrary order in order to ensure that an immobilized sandwich complex forms.
      <br/>
      Subsequently the sandwich complex containing the analyte that forms is separated from free labelled antibody and determined qualitatively or quantitatively optionally after addition of a suitable detection substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention the sample to be examined is firstly mixed and incubated with a ruthenium chelate labelled oligomeric antibody and a biotinylated antibody.
      <br/>
      In a second step magnetic beads which are coated with avidin or streptavidin are added and it is further incubated.
      <br/>
      Afterwards the mixture is passed over a magnet, the beads are separated i.e. the complex that forms is separated from the remaining sample and from non-bound labelled antibody and the separated complex is washed again with a solution which contains a reducing agent such as tripropylamine (TPA) and optionally a surface active agent.
      <br/>
      The washing process removes all the ruthenium except for that bound in the sandwich complex.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The measured Ru concentration is thus directly proportional to the analyte concentration.
      <br/>
      When an electrical voltage is applied a luminescence reaction occurs in which the ruthenium and the TPA react.
    </p>
    <p num="27">Optionally when using a labelled first receptor, an unlabelled analyte-specific receptor may be additonally present e.g. an unlabelled monomeric antibody or/and oligomeric antibody.</p>
    <p num="28">According to a further aspect the present invention concerns an oligomeric antibody comprising a conjugate of at least two antibodies, antibody fragments and mixtures thereof wherein the binding molecules are directly covalently linked together and which is characterized in that the degree of oligomerization is 2 to 15.</p>
    <p num="29">
      A direct linkage of the binding molecules means that the antibodies or antibody fragments are either linked together via a simple chemical bond or via a suitable bifunctional linker/spacer molecule.

      A large number of methods of accomplishing this and suitable spacer molecules are known to a person skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example bis(maleinimido)-methyl ester, dimethyl suberimidate, disuccinimidyl suberate, glutardialdehyde, N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate, N-5-azido-2-nitrobenzoylsuccinimide, N-succinimidyl (4-iodacetyl)-aminobenzoate, a combination of maleinimidohexanoyl-succinimidate and S-acetyl-mercaptosuccinic acid anhydride or analogous compounds come into consideration as chemical linkers.

      A luminescent metal chelate label is preferred as the label and particularly preferably the oligomeric antibody is ruthenylated i.e. the metal chelate is a ruthenium chelate.

      The results are shown in Table 1.

      It can be seen that as the degree of cross-linking increases (=molecular weight) the signals of the higher standards increase whereas the blank value (signal of the zero standard a) remains constant.
      <br/>
      Hence the sensitivity of the test increases i.e. the increase in the degree of oligomerization leads to a wider measuring range while retaining the lower limit of detection.

      It was found that the measuring range increases with an increasing amount of unlabelled antibody.

      At the same time the signal of the standard b decreases as well as that of the other human sera whereas that of the standard a (zero serum, blank value) remains essentially constant.

      Consequently there is an increasing worsening of the differentiation in the lower part of the measuring range.
      <br/>
      The quotient standard b/a which should be at least in the range of 1.9 to 2.0 for a reliable diagnosis is already below this value when 2  MU g/ml unlabelled antibody is added.

      The blank value (standard a) as well as the signal level of the other samples (human sera and standards) increase with an increasing AB-BPRU concentration.

      At the same time the measuring range is considerably increased with an increasing AB-BPRU concentration which in the present example runs almost proportional (a doubling of the antibody concentration corresponds approximately to a doubling of the measuring range).
