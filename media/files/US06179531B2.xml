      A portable machine for processing keys, which uses computer-controlled sensors and servo motors to control the position of a bevel scale and the position of a cutting depth scale, so as to accurately control the feeding of a reamer in processing a blank into a key.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a machine for processing keys, and more particularly to a portable machine for processing keys, which greatly shortens the processing time in making a key precisely.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Conventional machines for processing keys commonly use computer-controlled air cylinders to control the angle and stroke of the feeding of a reamer in processing a blank into a key.
      <br/>
      The air cylinders are controlled by a microprocessor, by means of the running of a computer program, to achieve eight different feeding strokes.
      <br/>
      Because a number of air cylinders and servomotors are used, conventional machines for processing keys are commonly bulky and heavy.
      <br/>
      Because air cylinders control the cutting angle and cutting depth of the reamer, it is difficult to achieve the desired cutting operation precisely.
      <br/>
      Further, because the air cylinders must achieve eight different feeding strokes, the design of the computer program is sophisticated.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention uses a computer to control the operation of a set of sensors and motors, so as to further control the movement of a bevel scale and a cutting depth scale, enabling the feeding of the reamer to be accurately controlled.
      <br/>
      According to one aspect of the present invention, a cutting angle control unit and a cutting depth control unit control the cutting angle and cutting depth of the reamer, which are in turn controlled by a set of sensors.
      <br/>
      The cutting angle control unit uses a bevel scale to control the cutting angle of the reamer.
      <br/>
      The cutting depth control unit uses a cutting depth scale to control the cutting depth of the reamer.
      <br/>
      The bevel scale and the cutting depth scale each have a plurality of peripheral notches.
      <br/>
      Through the respective peripheral notches, the sensors respectively detect the amount of movement of the bevel scale and the cutting depth scale.
      <br/>
      According to another aspect of the present invention, respective motors through respective toothed shafts move the bevel scale and the cutting depth scale.
      <br/>
      According to still another aspect of the present invention, a jig is used with the bevel scale to hold a blank, enabling the blank to be accurately processed into a key.
