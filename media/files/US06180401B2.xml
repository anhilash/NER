      <br/>
      A method of producing a polypeptide in fed batch cell culture is provided which involves an initial cell growth phase and a distinct production phase.
      <br/>
      In the initial growth stage, animal cells having nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide are cultured at a starting osmolality of about 280-330 mOsm in the presence of a concentration of glucose controlled throughout the culturing to be within a range between about 0.01 and 1 g/L.
      <br/>
      This is followed by a production phase, where the cultured animal cells of the growth phase are inoculated at a cell seed density of at least 1.0x106 cells/mL and the cells are cultured at a starting osmolarity of about 400-600 mOsm in the presence of a concentration of glucose controlled throughout the culturing to be within a range between about 0.01 and 1 g/L.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the glutamine concentration in the cell culture medium is simultaneously controlled in order to curtail production of lactic acid and ammonia which result from unnecessarily high glutamine concentrations.
      <br/>
      During the growth phase, production of potentially detrimental metabolic waste products, such as lactic acid, is controlled thereby curtailing the increase of osmolality due to accumulation and neutralization of waste products.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cell growth can be improved.
      <br/>
      In the production phase, the cell culture conditions are modified in order to arrest or reduce cell growth and thereby direct nutrient utilization toward production, as opposed to cell growth.
      <br/>
      Overall, it is intended that the method results in an improvement in specific productivity, reduction in production run times and/or an increase in final product concentration.

      I.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This invention relates to a method of improving polypeptide production in animal cell culture.
      <br/>
      In particular, it is directed to a method of culturing mammalian cells under conditions wherein the glucose concentration in the cell culture medium and the osmolality of the medium are controlled, so as to either promote cell growth or to promote recombinant polypeptide production.
    </p>
    <p num="4">II. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      With the advent of recombinant DNA technology the number of polypeptides which are able to be produced in recombinant cell culture has greatly increased.
      <br/>
      While some recombinant DNA techniques rely on bacterial or yeast cells for the production of polypeptides, production of polypeptides in animal cells (especially mammalian cells) is becoming widespread, particularly for the production of mammalian polypeptides.
      <br/>
      Similarly, cell fusion techniques for preparing hybridomas, which may be cultured to produce monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), are widely used.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Accordingly, techniques have been developed for enhancing cell growth and/or polypeptide production by such genetically modified animal cells.
      <br/>
      Several groups have looked at the effects of osmolality on cell growth and polypeptide production.

      Various osmolality ranges for cell growth or polypeptide production are recommended and, generally, the osmolality of the cell culture medium is increased via the addition of NaCl or amino acids.
      <br/>

    <p num="10">
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of controlling fed batch cell culture conditions for growth of animal cells so as to maintain high cell viability or extend the period of rapid cell growth.
      <br/>
      It is a further object to control production of potentially detrimental metabolic waste products, such as lactic acid, during culturing of mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      Also, it is an object to curtail the increase of osmolality, due to accumulation and neutralization of waste products and subsequent replacement of consumed glucose.

      This enables the growth phase of the production culture to be reduced or eliminated, thereby resulting in a concomitant decrease in the time required for optimal production of the polypeptide of interest by the cell culture.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">In accordance with the objects of the invention, a method of growing animal cells in fed batch cell culture is provided which comprises the steps of culturing the cells at a starting osmolality of about 280-330 mOsm and controlling the glucose concentration in the cell culture to be between about 0.01 and 1 g/L throughout the culturing.</p>
    <p num="16">
      In another aspect, the invention relates to a method of producing a polypeptide by animal cells which contain nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide in fed batch cell culture, wherein the starting osmolality of the cell culture is about 400-600 mOsm and the glucose concentration in the cell culture is controlled to be between about 0.01 and 1 g/L throughout the culturing.
      <br/>
      The starting cell density of the cell culture is at least about 1.0 * 106 cells/mL, preferably at least about 3.0 * 106 cells/mL.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In yet a further aspect, a method of producing a polypeptide in fed batch cell culture is provided which involves an initial cell growth phase and a distinct production phase.
      <br/>
      In the initial growth phase, animal cells having nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide are cultured at a starting osmolarity of about 280-330 mOsm in the presence of a concentration of glucose controlled throughout the culturing to be within a range between about 0.01 and 1 g/L.
      <br/>
      This is followed by a production phase, where the cultured animal cells of the growth phase are inoculated at a cell seed density of at least about 1.0 * 106 cells/mL and the cells are cultured at a starting osmolality of about 400-600 mOsm in the presence of a concentration of glucose controlled throughout the culturing to be within a range between about 0.01 and 1 g/L.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Preferably, the glutamine concentration in the cell culture medium is simultaneously controlled in order to control production of lactic acid and ammonia, which results from unnecessarily high glutamine concentrations.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS DEFINITIONS</heading>
    <p num="21">
      The phrase "fed batch cell culture" when used herein refers to a batch culture wherein the animal cells and culture medium are supplied to the culturing vessel initially and additional culture nutrients are fed, continuously or in discrete increments, to the culture during culturing, with or without periodic cell and/or product harvest before termination of culture.
      <br/>
      Fed batch culture includes "semi-continuous fed batch culture" wherein periodically whole culture (including cells and medium) is removed and replaced by fresh medium.
      <br/>
      Fed batch culture is distinguished from simple "batch culture" in which all components for cell culturing (including the animal cells and all culture nutrients) are supplied to the culturing vessel at the start of the culturing process.
      <br/>
      Fed batch culture can be further distinguished from perfusion culturing insofar as the supernate is not removed from the culturing vessel during the process (in perfusion culturing, the cells are restrained in the culture by, e.g., filtration, encapsulation, anchoring to microcarriers etc and the culture medium is continuously or intermittently introduced and removed from the culturing vessel).
      <br/>
      However, removal of samples for testing purposes during fed batch cell culture is contemplated.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The term "animal cells" encompasses invertebrate, non-mammalian vertebrate (e.g., avian, reptile and amphibian) and mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      Examples of invertebrate cells include the following insect cells: Spodoptera frugiperda (caterpillar), Aedes aegypti (mosquito), Aedes albopictus (mosquito), Drosophila melanogaster (fruitfly), and Bombyx mori.
      <br/>

Acad. Sci., 383:44-68 �1982�); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep G2).
      <br/>
      CHO cells are the preferred cell line for practicing the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The invention is also applicable to hybridoma cells.
      <br/>
      The term "hybridoma" refers to a hybrid cell line produced by the fusion of an immortal cell line of immunologic origin and an antibody producing cell.
      <br/>
      The term encompasses progeny of heterohybrid myeloma fusions, which are the result of a fusion with human cells and a murine myeloma cell line subsequently fused with a plasma cell, commonly known as a trioma cell line.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the term is meant to include any immortalized hybrid cell line which produces antibodies such as, for example, quadromas.
      <br/>
      See, e.g., Milstein et al., Nature, 537:3053 (1983).
      <br/>
      The hybrid cell lines can be of any species, including human and mouse.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In the most preferred embodiment however, the mammalian cell is a non-hybridoma mammalian cell which has been transformed with exogenous nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of interest.
      <br/>
      By "exogenous nucleic acid" is meant a nucleic acid sequence that is foreign to the cell, or homologous to the cell but in a position within the host cell nucleic acid in which the nucleic acid is ordinarily not found.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The expression "osmolality" is a measure of the osmotic pressure of dissolved solute particles in an aqueous solution.
      <br/>
      The solute particles include both ions and non-ionized molecules. osmolality is expressed as the concentration of osmotically active particles (i.e., osmoles) dissolved in 1 kg of water (1 mOsm/kg H2 O at 38 (degree)  C. is equivalent to an osmotic pressure of 19 mm Hg). "Osmolarity" refers to the number of solute particles dissolved in 1 liter of solution.
      <br/>
      Solutes which can be added to the culture medium so as to increase the osmolality thereof include proteins, peptides, amino acids, non-metabolized polymers, vitamins, ions, salts, sugars, metabolites, organic acids, lipids, etc.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the concentration of amino acids and NaCl in the culture medium is increased in order to achieve the desired osmolality ranges set forth herein.
      <br/>
      When used herein, the abbreviation "mOsm" means "milliosmoles/kg H2 O".
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The word "glucose" refers to either of  ALPHA -D-glucose or  BETA -D-glucose, separately or in combination.
      <br/>
      It is noted that  ALPHA  and  BETA  glucose forms are interconvertible in solution.
    </p>
    <p num="28">When used herein, the term "glutamine" refers to the amino acid L-glutamine (also known as "Gln" and "Q" by three-letter and single-letter designation, respectively) which is recognized as both an amino acid building block for protein synthesis and as an energy source in cell culture.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The terms "amino acids" and "amino acid" refer to all naturally occurring alpha amino acids in both their D and L stereoisomeric forms, and their analogs and derivatives.
      <br/>
      An analog is defined as a substitution of an atom in the amino acid with a different atom that usually has similar properties.
      <br/>
      A derivative is defined as an amino acid that has another molecule or atom attached to it.
      <br/>
      Derivatives would include, for example, acetylation of an amino group, amination of a carboxyl group, or oxidation of the sulfur residues of two cysteine molecules to form cystine.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As used herein, "polypeptide of interest" refers generally to peptides and proteins having more than about ten amino acids.
      <br/>
      The polypeptides may be homologous to the host cell, or preferably, may be exogenous, meaning that they are heterologous, i.e., foreign, to the host cell being utilized, such as a human protein produced by a Chinese hamster ovary cell, or a yeast polypeptide produced by a mammalian cell.
      <br/>
      Preferably, mammalian polypeptides (polypeptides that were originally derived from a mammalian organism) are used, more preferably those which are directly secreted into the medium.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Examples of bacterial polypeptides include, e.g., alkaline phosphatase and  BETA -lactamase.
      <br/>
      Examples of mammalian polypeptides include molecules such as renin, a growth hormone, including human growth hormone; bovine growth hormone; growth hormone releasing factor; parathyroid hormone; thyroid stimulating hormone; lipoproteins; alpha-1-antitrypsin; insulin A-chain; insulin B-chain; proinsulin; follicle stimulating hormone; calcitonin; luteinizing hormone; glucagon; clotting factors such as factor VIIIC, factor IX, tissue factor, and von Willebrands factor; anti-clotting factors such as Protein C; atrial natriuretic factor; lung surfactant; a plasminogen activator, such as urokinase or human urine or tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA); bombesin; thrombin; hemopoietic growth factor; tumor necrosis factor-alpha and -beta; enkephalinase; RANTES (regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted); human macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1-alpha); a serum albumin such as human serum albumin; mullerian-inhibiting substance; relaxin A-chain; relaxin B-chain; prorelaxin; mouse gonadotropin-associated peptide; a microbial protein, such as beta-lactamase; DNase; inhibin; activin; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); receptors for hormones or growth factors; integrin; protein A or D; rheumatoid factors; a neurotrophic factor such as bone-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3, -4, -5, or -6 (NT-3, NT-4, NT-5, or NT-6), or a nerve growth factor such as NGF- BETA ; platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF); fibroblast growth factor such as aFGF and bFGF; epidermal growth factor (EGF); transforming growth factor (TGF) such as TGF-alpha and TGF-beta, including TGF- BETA 1, TGF- BETA 2, TGF- BETA 3, TGF- BETA 4, or TGF- BETA 5; insulin-like growth factor-I and -II (IGF-I and IGF-II); des(1-3)-IGF-I (brain IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor binding proteins; CD proteins such as CD-3, CD-4, CD-8, and CD-19; erythropoietin; osteoinductive factors; immunotoxins; a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP); an interferon such as interferon-alpha, -beta, and -gamma; colony stimulating factors (CSFs), e.g., M-CSF, GM-CSF, and G-CSF; interleukins (ILs), e.g., IL-1 to IL-10; superoxide dismutase; T-cell receptors; surface membrane proteins; decay accelerating factor; viral antigen such as, for example, a portion of the AIDS envelope; transport proteins; homing receptors; addressing; regulatory proteins; antibodies; and fragments of any of the above-listed polypeptides.

    <p num="32">The most preferred polypeptides of interest are human polypeptides such as deoxyribonuclease (DNase) and transforming growth factor- BETA  (TGF BETA ).</p>
    <p num="33">The terms "cell culture medium" and "culture medium" refer to a nutrient solution used for growing mammalian cells that typically provides at least one component from one or more of the following categories:</p>
    <p num="34">
      1) an energy source, usually in the form of a carbohydrate such as glucose;
      <br/>

      3) vitamins and/or other organic compounds required at low concentrations;
      <br/>
      4) free fatty acids; and
      <br/>
      5) trace elements, where trace elements are defined as inorganic compounds or naturally occurring elements that are typically required at very low concentrations, usually in the micromolar range.
    </p>
    <p num="35">

      The initial osmolality of the culture medium is in the range of about 280-330 mOsm.
      <br/>
      The osmolality can be measured using an osmometer such as that sold by Fischer Scientific, Pittsburg, Pa., under the brand name OSMETTE (tm) , for example.
      <br/>
      In order to achieve an osmolality in this range, the concentration of various constituents in the culture medium can be adjusted.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the culture medium contains excess amino acids (see, e.g., the "Super" medium of U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,469) and the osmolality is adjusted to 280-330 mOsm via the addition of a basal concentration of glucose (in the concentration specified herein) and, optionally, a salt (e.g., NaCl).

      <br/>
      A suitable initial cell seed density for the cell growth phase is in the range 3 * 105 to 1.5 * 106 cells/ml, for example.
      <br/>
      A suitable culturing vessel for cell growth is a pH controlled bioreactor.
      <br/>
      An autoclavable glass fermenter (sold by Applikon, Foster City, Calif.) or stainless steel fermenter (sold by Biolafitte, Princeton, N.J.) are available for use with the invention.
      <br/>
      Other culturing vessels suitable for practicing the invention are well known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      FIG. 1 shows a culturing system which is suitable for practicing the invention set forth herein.
      <br/>
      The main system components are a tangential flow filtration sample device (1) contained within a recycle loop which is aseptically attached to the culturing vessel or bioreactor (2), an analyzer (3) e.g., a flow injection analyzer (FIA) which determines the glucose concentration of a cell-free medium sample provided by the sample device, a process computer or controller (4) capable of turning a glucose feed pump on or off to maintain the desired concentration, and a feed tank (5) containing sterile concentrated glucose solution which is pumped, as required, into the bioreactor (2).
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      As mentioned above, the starting osmolality of the culture medium is about 280-330 mOsm and is preferably maintained at a low concentration near the range of about 280-330 mOsm throughout the culturing.
      <br/>
      Conveniently, it has been found that by controlling the concentration of glucose (the primary energy source) in the culture medium throughout the culturing, the osmolality of the medium can be maintained at about the desirable range specified.
      <br/>
      Controlling the glucose concentration serves to provide adequate carbon source to the cells and simultaneously control the production of lactic acid by the host cells.
      <br/>
      This is advantageous in that it limits the pH decrease in the culture medium which necessitates the addition of a neutralizer (e.g., a base such as Na2 CO3 or NaOH), which causes the osmolality to rise.
      <br/>
      It has been found that such increases in osmolality have a negative effect on cell growth or viability in the culture medium.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In the experiments herein disclosed, it has been found that a suitable overall glucose concentration for the culture medium is in the range 0.01-1 g/L, preferably 0.02-0.5 g/L, and more preferably 0.05-0.2 g/L. In order to monitor and maintain the glucose concentration within the desired range, flow injection analysis (i.e., FIA, disclosed in Huang et al., supra, or Ruzicka and Hanson, in Flow Injection Analysis, 1988, 2nd Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, for example) provides a convenient mechanism for on-line monitoring and control of glucose concentration.
      <br/>
      In an exemplary FIA system, a small quantity of filtered process medium (about 7  MU l) is introduced into a flowing carrier stream (phosphate buffered saline solution, modified by addition of antimicrobial agents and by addition of NaCl to bring its osmolality to a value near the middle of the expected process osmolality range) by a HPLC-type injection valve.
      <br/>
      The sample is diluted about 70-fold as it passes through a diluter on its way to the flow-through detector.
      <br/>
      Detection is accomplished using an electrochemical electrode covered by a membrane containing immobilized glucose oxidase (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, Ohio).
      <br/>
      The signal from the electrode/conditioner is transmitted to the process controller or computer where process signals are compared with stored values obtained with standard glucose solutions; the appropriate signal (on or off) is transmitted to the glucose feed pump.
      <br/>
      FIA is desirable insofar as it provides a system for the real-time measurement and control of glucose concentration in mammalian cell cultures with the potential for frequent sampling and automated sample pretreatment.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Alternatively, intermittent off-line sampling of the culture medium can be carried out.
      <br/>
      The glucose concentration of the culture medium can then be modified by the modulation of a glucose feed solution as required.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      In at least one embodiment of the invention, the glutamine concentration in the culture medium is controlled simultaneously with the glucose concentration.
      <br/>
      Such control is desirable because glutamine is utilized more rapidly by mammalian cells at low glucose concentrations and this leads to the production of waste products such as ammonia and lactic acid which can have direct negative effects on cell growth and/or production and tend to cause the osmolality to increase.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the glutamine concentration is controlled throughout the culturing to be in a range of 0.2 to 2 mM, more preferably 0.5 to 1 mM. Control of the glutamine concentration can be achieved using ;a FIA system discussed above, for example.

      The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (dO2) and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for cell growth, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.
      <br/>
      Generally, the pH is adjusted to a level between about 6.5 and 7.5 using either an acid (e.g., CO2) or a base (e.g., Na2 CO3 or NaOH).
      <br/>
      A suitable temperature range for culturing mammalian cells such as CHO cells is between about 30 to 38 (degree)  C. and a suitable dO2 is between 5-90%.

      In order to isolate the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide of interest, libraries are screened with probes designed to identify the gene encoding the polypeptide or the polypeptide per se.
      <br/>
      For cDNA expression libraries, suitable probes include monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies that recognize and specifically bind to the polypeptide of interest; oligonucleotides of about 20-80 bases in length that encode known or suspected portions of the polypeptide's cDNA from the same or different species; and/or complementary or homologous cDNAs or fragments thereof that encode the same or a similar gene.
      <br/>
      Appropriate probes for screening genomic DNA libraries include, but are not limited to, oligonucleotides, cDNAs, or fragments thereof that encode the same or a similar gene, and/or homologous genomic DNAs or fragments thereof.
      <br/>
      Screening the cDNA or genomic library with the selected probe may be conducted using standard procedures as described in chapters 10-12 of Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989).

      Suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the nucleic acid from the polypeptide, such as DHFR or thymidine kinase.
      <br/>
      The mammalian cell transformants are placed under selection pressure that only the transformants are uniquely adapted to survive by virtue of having taken up the marker.
      <br/>
      Selection pressure is imposed by culturing the transformants under conditions in which the concentration of selection agent in the medium is successively changed, thereby leading to amplification of both the selection gene and the DNA that encodes the polypeptide of interest.
      <br/>
      Amplification is the process by which genes in greater demand for the production of a protein critical for growth are reiterated in tandem within the chromosomes of successive generations of recombinant cells.
      <br/>
      Increased quantities of the polypeptide are synthesized from the amplified DNA.
      <br/>
      Other examples of amplifiable genes include metallothionein-I and -II, preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      For example, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR.
      <br/>
      An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity, prepared and propagated as described by Urlaub and Chasin, Proc.
      <br/>
      Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77:4216 (1980).
      <br/>
      The transformed cells are then exposed to increased levels of methotrexate.
      <br/>
      This leads to the synthesis of multiple copies of the DHFR gene, and, concomitantly, multiple copies of other DNA comprising the expression vectors, such as the DNA encoding the polypeptide of interest.
      <br/>
      This amplification technique can be used with any otherwise suitable host, e.g., ATCC No. CCL61 CHO-K1, notwithstanding the presence of endogenous DHFR if, for example, a mutant DHFR gene that is highly resistant to Mtx is employed (EP 117,060).

      Transcription of a DNA encoding the polypeptide of interest by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector.
      <br/>
      Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about from 10 to 300 bp, that act on a promoter to increase its transcription.
      <br/>
      Enhancers are relatively orientation and position independent, having been found 5' (Laimins et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 78:993 �1981�) and 3' (Lusky et al., Mol. Cell Bio., 3:1108 �1983�) to the transcription unit, within an intron (Banerji et al., Cell, 33:729 �1983�), as well as within the coding sequence itself (Osborne et al., Mol. Cell Bio., 4:1293 �1984�).
      <br/>
      Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin,  ALPHA -fetoprotein, and insulin).
      <br/>
      Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus.
      <br/>
      Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers.

      See also Yaniv, Nature, 297:17-18 (1982) on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters.
      <br/>
      The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5' or 3' to the polypeptide-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5' from the promoter.

      Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA.

      Such sequences are commonly available from the 5' and, occasionally 3', untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs.

      Particularly useful in the practice of this invention are expression vectors that provide for the transient expression in mammalian cells of DNA encoding the polypeptide of interest.
      <br/>
      In general, transient expression involves the use of an expression vector that is able to replicate efficiently in a host cell, such that the host cell accumulates many copies of the expression vector and, in turn, synthesizes high levels of a desired polypeptide encoded by the expression vector.
      <br/>
      Sambrook et al., supra, pp. 16.17-16.22. Transient expression systems, comprising a suitable expression vector and a host cell, allow for the convenient positive identification of polypeptides encoded by cloned DNAs, as well as for the rapid screening of such polypeptides for desired biological or physiological properties.

    <p num="74">3. Polypeptide Production Phase</p>
    <p num="75">
      The cell growth phase is generally followed by a polypeptide production phase, which is distinct therefrom.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the production phase is carried out in a different culturing vessel from the cell growth phase.
      <br/>
      However, the same vessel can be employed for each step.
      <br/>
      For example, it is possible to supply the culture medium of the growth phase with high-osmolality, low-glucose containing medium for production.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, medium-exchange using cell-fluid separation devices available in the art (e.g., cross-flow filtration, rotating screens or fluidized bed microcarriers) enables the same vessel to be used.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The production phase involves inoculating the cultured animal cells of the growth phase at a cell seed density of at least about 1.0 * 106 cells/mL, preferably at least about 3.0 * 106 cells/mL.
      <br/>
      The animal cells are cultured at a starting osmolality of about 400-600 mOsm, more preferably 400-500 mOsm, in a culturing vessel such as that exemplified for the growth phase.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      In order to achieve a culture medium having the osmolality specified, the PS-04, Diesel or Super cell culture media disclosed above can be used, and the osmolality of the culture medium can be increased via the addition of the basal concentration of glucose and a salt (such as NaCl, for example).
      <br/>
      This type of culture medium contains an excess of amino acids in order to provide additional cell nutrients and achieve a high starting osmolality.
      <br/>
      However, as will be readily apparent to the ordinarily skilled practitioner, the concentration(s) of other constituents in the culture medium can be adjusted in order to reach the desired osmolality.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Preferably, the osmolality is maintained at substantially the desirable range throughout the culturing.
      <br/>
      Conveniently, controlling the supply of glucose to the cell culture medium helps to prevent excessive increases in osmolality substantially above the desirable optimum.
    </p>
    <p num="79">Accordingly, the production phase is carried out in the presence of a concentration of glucose controlled; throughout the culturing to be within a range between about 0.01 and 1 g/L, preferably 0.02-0.5 g/L, and more preferably 0.05-0.2 g/L. In order to monitor and control the glucose concentration of the culture medium in the range specified, FIA or other automated on-line control systems are useful.</p>
    <p num="80">Preferably, the glutamine concentration is also controlled throughout the culturing to be in a range of 0.2 to 2 mM, more preferably 0.5 to 1 mM. Control of the glutamine concentration can be achieved using a FIA system similar to that discussed above, for example.</p>
    <p num="81">
      The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, dO2 and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for protein production, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.
      <br/>
      For example, the pH may be adjusted to a range between 6.5 and 7.5 and the temperature for production may be between 30 and 38 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      An advantageous feature of the above invention is that the production cycle can be reduced from the normal time of about 10-15 days or more for recombinant proteins to about 9 days or less, preferably 7 days or less.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments (e.g., where the polypeptide of interest is DNase) the production phase is terminated before the maximum polypeptide titer is obtained.
      <br/>
      This is advantageous as the resultant DNase composition has a reduced percentage deamidation compared to DNase produced in longer runs.
    </p>
    <p num="83">Following the polypeptide production phase, the polypeptide of interest is recovered from the culture medium using techniques which are well established in the art.</p>
    <p num="84">4. Polypeptide Purification</p>
    <p num="85">The polypeptide of interest preferably is recovered from the culture medium as a secreted polypeptide, although it also may be recovered from host cell lysates when directly expressed without a secretory signal.</p>
    <p num="86">
      As a first step, the culture medium or lysate is centrifuged to remove particulate cell debris.
      <br/>
      The polypeptide thereafter is purified from contaminant soluble proteins and polypeptides, with the following procedures being exemplary of suitable purification procedures: by fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns; ethanol precipitation; reverse phase HPLC; chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE; chromatofocusing; SDS-PAGE; ammonium sulfate precipitation; gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75; and protein A Sepharose columns to remove contaminants such as IgG.
      <br/>
      A protease inhibitor such as phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) also may be useful to inhibit proteolytic degradation during purification.
      <br/>
      One skilled in the art will appreciate that purification methods suitable for the polypeptide of interest may require modification to account for changes in the character of the polypeptide upon expression in recombinant cell culture.
