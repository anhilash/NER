      The invention is a method for the production of D-pantothenic acid by the fermentation of microorganisms in which at least the panD gene is enhanced (overexpressed), optionally in combination with the panB and/or panC gene, to provide for the enrichment of the pantothenic acid in the medium or the cells of the microorganisms.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">Pantothenic acid is a commercially significant vitamin which is used in cosmetics, medicine, human nourishment and in animal nourishment.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Pantothenic acid can be produced by chemical synthesis or biotechnologically by the fermentation of suitable microorganisms in suitable nutrient solutions.
      <br/>
      DL-pantolactone is an important intermediate stage in the chemical synthesis.
      <br/>
      It is produced in a multi-stage process from formaldehyde, isobutylaldehyde and cyanide.
      <br/>
      In further method steps the racemic mixture is separated and D-pantolactone condensed with  BETA -alanine and D-pantothenic acid obtained.
      <br/>
      The advantage of the fermentative production with microorganisms resides in the direct formation of the desired stereoisomeric D-form, which is free of L-pantothenic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Various types of bacteria such as, for example, Escherichia coli, Arthrobacter ureafaciens, Corynebacterium erythrogenes, Brevibacterium ammoniagenes and also yeasts such as, for example, Debaromyces castellii can produce D-pantothenic acid in a nutrient solution containing glucose, DL-pantoic acid and  BETA -alanine, as is shown in EP-A 0,493,060.
      <br/>
      EP-A 0,493,060 also shows that the formation of D-pantothenic acid is improved in the case of Escherichia coli by amplification of pantothenic-acid biosynthetic genes from E. coli, which are contained on the plasmids pFV3 and pFV5, in a nutrient solution containing glucose, DL-pantoic acid and  BETA -alanine.
    </p>
    <p num="4">EP-A 0,590,857 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,518,906 describe mutants derived from Escherichia coli strain IFO3547 such as FV5714, FV525, FV814, FV521, FV221, FV6051 and FV5069 which carry resistance genes against various antimetabolites such as salicylic acid,  ALPHA -ketobutyric acid,  BETA -hydroxyaspartic acid, O-methylthreonine and  ALPHA -ketoisovaleric acid and produce D-pantothenic acid in a nutrient solution containing glucose, pantoic acid and in a nutrient solution containing glucose and  BETA -alanine. E-A 0,590,857 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,518,906 also show that after the amplification of the pantothenic-acid biosynthesis genes contained on the plasmid pFV31, in the strains cited above, the production of D-pantoic acid is improved in a nutrient solution containing glucose and that the production of D-pantothenic acid is improved in a nutrient solution containing glucose and  BETA -alanine.</p>
    <p num="5">Moreover, WO97/10340 shows that the production of pantothenic acid can be further increased in strains of Escherichia coli forming pantothenic acid by elevating the activity of the enzyme acetohydroxy-acid synthase II, an enzyme of valine biosynthesis.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">It is an object of the invention to provide novel bases for improved methods for the fermentative production of pantothenic acid.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Pantothenic acid, or Vitamin B3, is a commercially significant product which is used in cosmetics, medicine, human nourishment and in animal nourishment.
      <br/>
      There is therefore general interest in making available novel methods of producing pantothenic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="8">When D-pantothenic acid or pantothenic acid or pantothenate are mentioned in the following text not only the free acid but also the salts of D-pantothenic acid such as, for example, the calcium salt, sodium salt, ammonium salt or potassium salt are meant.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Subject matter of the invention includes, among other things, a method for the fermentative production of D-pantothenic acid using microorganisms which, in particular, already produce D-pantothenic acid and in which the panD gene coding for L-aspartate-1-decarboxylase (E.C. 4.1.1.11) is enhanced, especially overexpressed individually or in combination with the genes panB and/or panC.
      <br/>
      The invention relates to corresponding recombinant DNA sequences like those documented in the claims.
      <br/>
      The invention also includes methods for the fermentative production of D-pantothenic acid which are carried out using the improved microorganisms produced according to the invention which produce D-pantothenic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The concept "enhancement" describes in this connection the elevation of the intracellular activity of one or several enzymes in a microorganism which are coded by the corresponding DNA in that, for example, the copy number of the gene(s) is increased, a strong promoter is used or a gene is used which codes for a corresponding enzyme with a high activity and optionally combines these measures.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The microorganisms constituting the subject matter of the present invention can produce pantothenic acid from glucose, saccharose, lactose, fructose, maltose, molasses, starch, cellulose or from glycerol and ethanol.
      <br/>
      They can be fungi or yeasts or Gram-positive bacteria, for example, of the genus Corynebacterium, or Gram-negative bacteria such as, for example, those of the Enterobacteriaceae.
      <br/>
      In the family of Enterobacteriaceae the genus Escherichlia with the species Escherichia coli is to be cited in particular.
      <br/>
      Within the species Escherichia coli the so-called K-12 strains such as, for example, the strains MG1655 or W3110 (Neidhard et al.: Escherichia coli and Salmonella.
      <br/>
      Cellular and Molecular Biology (ASM Press, Washington, D.C.)) or the Escherichia coli wild-type strain IFO03547 (Institute for Fermentation, Osaka, Japan) and mutants derived from them are to be cited.
      <br/>
      In the genus Corynebacterium especially the species Corynebacterium glutamicum is to be cited, which is known to the skilled artisan for its ability to produce amino acids.
      <br/>
      This species includes wild-type strains such as, for example, Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13032, Brevibacterium flavum ATCC14067, Corynebacterium melassecola ATCC17965 and mutants derived from them.
    </p>
    <p num="12">The present inventors discovered that microorganisms produce pantothenic acid in an improved manner after overexpression of the novel panD gene, especially from Corynebacterium glutamicum, coding for L-aspartate-1-decarboxylase (E.C. 4.1.1.11).</p>
    <p num="13">The inventors discovered in addition that the overexpression of the panD gene has an advantageous effect in strains in which the genes panB and panC coding for ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase and pantothenate synthetase are additionally present in an overexpressed state either individually or together.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In order to achieve an overexpression, the copy number of the corresponding genes can be elevated or the promoter and regulatory region, which is located upstream from the structural gene, can be mutated.
      <br/>
      Expression cassettes which are inserted upstream from the structural gene operate in the same manner.
      <br/>
      It is additionally possible to increase the expression in the course of the fermentative formation of D-pantothenate by inducible promoters.
      <br/>
      The expression is likewise improved by measures for extending the life of m-RNA.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the enzymatic activity is likewise enhanced by preventing the degradation of the enzymatic protein.
      <br/>
      The genes or gene constructs can be present either in plasmids with different copy number or be integrated in the chromosome and amplified.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, an overexpression of the genes concerned can furthermore be achieved by altering the composition of the media and conduction of the culture.

    <p num="16">
      In order to isolate the panD gene or other genes such as, for example, the genes panB and panC from C. glutamicum, at first a gene bank of this microorganism is established in E. coli.
      <br/>
      The establishment of gene banks is documented in generally known textbooks and manuals.
      <br/>
      The textbook of Winnacker: Gene und Klone, Eine Einfuhrung in die Gentechnologie �German--Genes and Clones, An Introduction to Gene Technology� (Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany, 1990) or the manual of Sambrook et al.: Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989) are cited as examples.
      <br/>
      A known gene bank is that of the E. coli K-12 strain W3110 established by Kohara et al. (Cell 50, 495-508 (1987)) in  LAMBDA  vectors.
      <br/>
      Bathe et al. (Molecular and General Genetics, 252:255-265, 1996) describe a gene bank of C. glutamicum ATCC13032 which was established with the aid of the cosmid vector SuperCos I (Wahl et al., 1987, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 84:2160-2164) in the E. coli strain K-12 NM554 (Raleigh et al., 1988, Nucleic Acids Research 16:1563-1575).
      <br/>
      In order to produce a gene bank of C. glutamicum in E. coli, even plasmids such as pBR322 (Bolivar, Life Sciences, 25, 807-818 (1979)) or pUC9 (Vieira et al., 1982, Gene 25: 259-268) can be used.
      <br/>
      Suitable hosts are especially those E. coli strains which are restriction-defective and recombination-defective.
      <br/>
      An example for this is the strain DH5 ALPHA mcr described by Grant et al., (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 87 (1990) 4645-4649).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The gene bank is subsequently inserted into an indicator strain by transformation (Hanahan, Journal of Molecular Biology 166, 557-580, 1983) or electroporation (Tauch et al., 1994, FEMS Microbiological Letters, 123:343-347).
      <br/>
      The indicator strain is distinguished in that it comprises a mutation in the gene constituting the object of interest which causes a detectable phenotype, for example, an auxotrophy.
      <br/>
      In the framework of the present invention the E. coli mutant DV9 (Vallari and Rock, Journal of Bacteriology 1985, 164:136-142), which carries a mutation in the panD gene, is especially interesting.
      <br/>
      Another example of an E. coli mutant needing pantothenic acid is the strain SJ2, which carries a mutation in the panB gene and can be ordered from the Genetic Stock Center of Yale University (New Haven, Conn., USA).
      <br/>
      After transformation of the indicator strain such as, for example, the panD mutant DV9 with a recombinant plasmid which carries the gene constituting the object of interest such as, for example, the panD gene and expression of the gene concerned, the indicator strain becomes prototrophic as regards the corresponding property such as, for example, the need for pantothenic acid.
      <br/>
      The gene or DNA fragment isolated in this manner can be characterized by determination of the sequence as described, for example, in Sanger et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America USA, 74:5463-5467, 1977).
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the degree of identity with known genes contained in data banks such as, for example, the GenBank (Benson et al., 1998, Nucleic Acids Research, 26:1-7) can be analyzed with published methods (Altschul et al., 1990, Journal of Molecular Biology 215:403-410).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In this manner the novel DNA sequence of C. glutamicum coding for the gene panD was obtained, which is a component of the present invention as SEQ ID NO:1.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the amino-acid sequences of the corresponding enzymes were derived from the present DNA sequence with the methods described above.
      <br/>
      The resulting amino-acid sequence of the panD gene product, namely, L-aspartate 1-decarboxylase, is shown in SEQ ID NO:2.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the novel DNA sequence of C. glutamicum coding for the genes panB and panC was obtained in this manner, which DNA sequence is a component of the present invention as SEQ ID NO:3.
      <br/>
      The resulting amino-acid sequence of the panB gene product, namely, ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase, is shown in SEQ ID NO:4 and in SEQ ID NO:5 the resulting amino-acid sequence of the panC gene product, namely, pantothenate synthetase.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Coding DNA sequences resulting from SEQ ID NO:1 and/or SEQ ID NO:3 through the degeneracy of the genetic code are likewise components of the invention.
      <br/>
      In the same manner DNA sequences which hybridize with SEQ ID NO:1 and/or SEQ ID NO:3 are components of the invention.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, in the technical world conservative amino-acid exchanges such as, for example, the exchange of glycine for alanine or of aspartic acid for glutamic acid in proteins are known as sense mutations which do not result in any basic change of the activity of the protein, that is, they are functionally neutral.
      <br/>
      It is furthermore known that changes on the N- and/or C terminus of a protein do not significantly affect its function in an adverse manner or can even stabilize it.
      <br/>
      An expert in the art will find data about this in, among other locations, Ben-Bassat et al., (Journal of Bacteriology 169:751-757 (1987)), in O'Regan et al., (Gene 77:237-251 (1989)), in Sahin-Toth et al., (Protein Sciences 3:240-247 (1994)), in Hochuli et al., (Bio/Technology 6:1321-1325 (1988)) and in known textbooks of genetics and molecular biology.
      <br/>
      Amino-acid sequences resulting in a corresponding manner from SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:4 and/or SEQ ID NO:5 are likewise components of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The gene isolated and characterized in this manner can be subsequently brought to expression individually or in combination with others in a suitable microorganism.
      <br/>
      A known method for expressing or overexpressing genes consists in amplifying them with the aid of plasmid vectors which can be provided in addition with expression signals.
      <br/>
      Those plasmid vectors which can replicate in the corresponding microorganisms can be considered as plasmid vectors.
      <br/>
      For Escherichia coli, for example, the vectors pSC101 (Vocke and Bastia, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 80 (21), 6557-6561 (1983)) or pKK223-3 (Brosius and Holy, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 81, 6929 (1984)), for Corynebacterium glutamicum, for example, the vector pEKEx1 (Eikmanns et al., Gene 102:93-98 (1991)) or pZ8-1 (European patent 0,375,889) can be considered for the present invention.
      <br/>
      Examples of such microorganisms are the C. glutamicum strains ATCC13032/pND-D2 and ATCC13032/pND-DBC2 and the E. coli strain MG1655/pND-D2, which contain the plasmids pND-D2 and pND-DBC2.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pND-D2 is an E. coli-C. glutamicum shuttle vector which is based on the plasmid pZ8-1 and carries the panD gene of C. glutamicum.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pND-DBC2 is an E. coli-C. glutamicum shuttle vector which is based on the plasmid pZ8-1 and carries the panD, panB and panC genes of C. glutamicum.
    </p>
    <p num="21">It is obvious to an expert in the art that chromosomal mutations which bring about resistances against metabolites and antimetabolites or which prevent the reduction of precursors of pantothenic acid can be combined in an advantageous manner with the measures constituting subject matter of the invention.</p>
    <p num="22">
      The microorganisms produced in accordance with the invention can be cultivated continuously or discontinuously in a batch method (batch cultivation) or in a feed batch method or repeated feed batch method for the purpose of producing pantothenic acid.
      <br/>
      A summary of known cultivation methods is described in the textbook by Chmiel (Bioprocesstechnik 1.

      The culture medium to be used must satisfy the demands of the particular microorganisms.
      <br/>
      Descriptions of culture media of various microorganisms are contained in the manual "Manual of Methods for general Bacteriology" of the American Society for Bacteriology (Washington, DC, USA, 1981).
      <br/>
      Sugars and carbohydrates such as, for example, glucose, saccharose, lactose, fructose, maltose, molasses, starch and cellulose, oils and fats such as, for example, soy oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil and coconut fat, fatty acids such as, for example, palmitic acid, stearic acid and lineic acid, alcohols such as, for example, glycerol and ethanol and organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid can be used as carbon source.
      <br/>
      These substances can be used individually or as a mixture.
      <br/>
      Organic, nitrogen-containing compounds such as peptones, yeast extract, meat extract, malt extract, corn steep liquor, soybean meal and urea or inorganic compounds such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate, ammonium carbonate and ammonium nitrate can be used as nitrogen source.
      <br/>
      The nitrogen sources can be used individually or as a mixture.
      <br/>
      Potassium dihydrogenphosphate or dipotassium hydrogenphosphate or the corresponding sodium-containing salts can be used as phosphorus source.
      <br/>
      The culture medium must also contain metal salts such as, for example, magnesium sulfate or iron sulfate, which are necessary for growth.

      Finally, essential growth substances such as amino acids and vitamins can be used in addition to the substances cited above.
      <br/>
      Moreover, precursors of pantothenic acid such as aspartate,  BETA -alanine, ketoisovalerate, ketopantoic acid or pantoic acid and optionally their salts can be added to the culture medium for an additional increase in the production of pantothenic acid.
      <br/>
      The cited substances to be used can be added to the culture in the form of a one-time batch or supplied in a suitable manner during the cultivation.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Basic compounds such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia or acidic compounds such as phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid are added in a suitable manner for controlling the pH of the culture.
      <br/>
      Anti-foaming agents such as, for example, fatty-acid polyglycolester can be added for controlling the development of foam.
      <br/>
      In order to maintain the stability of plasmids, suitable, selectively acting substances, for example, antibiotics can be added to the medium.
      <br/>
      In order to maintain aerobic conditions, oxygen or oxygen-containing gas mixtures such as, for example, air are charged into the culture.
      <br/>
      The temperature of the culture is normally approximately 20 (degree)  C. to 50 (degree)  C. and preferably approximately 25 (degree)  C. to 45 (degree)  C. The culture is continued until a maximum of pantothenic acid has formed.
      <br/>
      This goal is normally achieved within 10 hours to 160 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Strains with a high activity of the enzyme L-aspartate 1-decarboxylase can also be used for the production of  BETA -alanine from L-aspartate.
      <br/>
      Fermentative methods, enzymatic conversion reactions or combinations of both can be used for this.

      Cloning of the panD gene
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Chromosomal DNA from C. glutamicum ATCC13032 was isolated as described in Tauch et al. (1995, Plasmid, 33:168-179) and partially cleaved with the restriction enzyme Sau3A (Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany), product description Sau3A, code No. 27-0913-02).
      <br/>
      DNA fragments in a size range of 7-9 kb were isolated with the aid of the "Nucleotrap Extraction Kit for Nucleic Acids" (Macherey and Nagel, Duren, Germany; cat.
      <br/>
      No. 740584) and ligated into the dephosphorylated BamHI cleavage site of vector pUC19 (Norrander et al., 1982, Gene, 26:101-1-6), which was ordered from the company MBI Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania).
      <br/>
      The ligation was carried out as by Sambrook et al. (1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor), during which the DNA mixture was incubated overnight with T4 ligase (Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany).
      <br/>
      This ligation mixture was subsequently electroporated into the E. coli strain DH5 ALPHA MCR (Grant, 1990, (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 87:4645-4649) (Tauch, 1994, FEMS Microbiological Letters, 123:343-347) and plated out onto LB agar (Lennox, 1955, Virology, 1:190)+100  MU g/ml ampicillin.
      <br/>
      After incubation for 24 hours at 37 (degree)  C. the C. glutamicum gene bank was able to be obtained from the transformants by re-isolation of the plasmid DNA according to the "alkaline lysis method" of Birnboim and Doly (Nucleic Acids Research, 7:1513-1523, 1997).
      <br/>
      Competent cells of the E. coli strain DV9 (Vallari and Rock, 1985, Journal of Bacteriology, 164:136-142), which carries a mutation in the panD gene, were electroporated with this gene bank.
      <br/>
      The electroporation batch was washed twice following the regeneration phase (Tauch et al., 1994, FEMS Microbiological Letters, 123: 343-347) with medium E (Vogel and Bonner, 1956, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 218:97-106).
      <br/>
      The composition of medium E is shown in Table 1. 50 ml medium E+100  MU g/ml ampicillin, which were in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask, were inoculated with these cells and incubated in an air agitator at 250 U/min and 19 (degree)  C. After a two-day incubation the bacterial suspension was diluted and spread out onto LB agar (Lennox, 1955, Virology, 1:190) which had been supplemented with 100  MU g/ml ampicillin.

    <p num="35">
      The plasmid DNA of a DV9 transformant was isolated, designated as pNIC-1.3 and characterized by agarose gel electrophoresis (Sambrook et al.: Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual 1989 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press) and by comparison with standard DNA fragments of a known length.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pNIC-1.3 contains an insertion with a length of 7 kbp.
      <br/>
      The complementation capacity of pNIC-1.3 was checked by renewed transformation of the panD mutant DV9.
      <br/>
      The transformants obtained were again capable of growing in medium E free of  BETA -alanine under the conditions indicated above.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The subcloning of the 7 kb insert took place by cleaving the plasmid pNIC-1.3 with the restriction enzymes BamHI (Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany), product description BamHI, code No. 27-0868-03), EcoRI (Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany), product description EcoRI, code No. 27-0884-03) and Bg1II (Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany), product description Bg1II, code No. 27-0946-02) and subsequent ligation into the appropriately restriction-digested vector pK18mob (Schafer, 1994, Gene, 145:69-73).
      <br/>
      The ligation batch obtained was electroporated into the E. coli panD mutant DV9; the selection for complemented transformants took place as described above and the agar plates contained in this instance 50  MU g/ml kanamycin.
      <br/>
      The plasmids of complemented individual clones were isolated and characterized by means of restriction analyses.
      <br/>
      An EcoRI subclone, called pNIC-10 in the following, with a DNA insert approximately 3 kb in size was selected for the following sequence analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="37">2. Sequencing of the panD gene</p>
    <p num="38">
      The 3 kb fragment of pNIC-10 was cleaved with various restriction enzymes for its double-stranded sequencing and the fragments subcloned into the plasmids pUC19 or pK18mob.
      <br/>
      The plasmid DNA used for the sequencing was isolated according to the instructions of the producer with the "QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit" (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, Calif., USA) and the determination of the plasmid sizes carried out by agarose gel electrophoresis.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The sequencing took place according to the dideoxy chain-terminating method of Sanger et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 74: 5463-5467, 1977) with modifications according to Zimmermann et al. (Nucleic Acids Research, 18:1067, 1990).
      <br/>
      The "Cy5-AutoRead Sequencing Kit" of Pharmacia (product NO. 27-2690-02, Freiburg, Germany) was used.
      <br/>
      The gel electrophoretic separation and analysis of the sequencing reaction took place in a "Long Ranger (tm)  Gel Solution" polyacrylamide gel (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, Me., USA) with the "automatic Laser-Fluorescence (A.L.F.) Express DNA Sequencing Device" of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden).
      <br/>
      The raw sequencing data obtained were subsequently processed using the Staden program packet (Nucleic Acids Research, 14:217-231, 1986) version 97-0.
      <br/>
      All individual sequences of the pNIC-10 clones were assembled to a cohesive contig 3060 bp in length which was designated as contig13.
      <br/>
      The computer-supported coding-range analysis with the program XNIP (Staden, 1986, Nucleic Acids Research, 14:217-231) of the entire DNA fragment resulted in the identification of five open reading frames (ORF's).
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      FIG. 1 shows a restriction map of contig13 as well as the position of the ORF's designated as orf-1 to orf-5.
      <br/>
      Homology analyses were carried out with the "BLAST search programs" (Gish and States, 1993, Nature of Genetics, 3:266-272; Altschul et al., 1990, Journal of Molecular Biology, 215:403-410), which were made available via the online service of the NCBI server of the "National Library of Medicine" (Bethesda, Md., USA).
      <br/>
      The analysis of contig13 showed that orf-3 is the panD-gene.
      <br/>
      Orf-3 is designated in the following as panD.
      <br/>
      The nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment carrying the panD gene is shown as SEQ ID NO:1.
      <br/>
      The amino-acid sequence of the panD gene product resulting with the above methods, namely, L-aspartate 1-decarboxylase, is shown as SEQ ID NO:2.

    <p num="44">
      Chromosomal DNA from C. glutamicum ATCC13032 was isolated as described in Schwarzer and Puhler (Bio/Technology 9 (1990) 84-87) and cleaved with the restriction endonuclease Sau3A.
      <br/>
      After gel electrophoretic separation DNA fragments were extracted in a size range of 3 to 7 kb and 9 to 20 kb and subsequently ligated into the singular BamHI cleavage site of vector pBR322.
      <br/>
      The E. coli strain DH5 ALPHA amcr (Grant et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America USA, 87 (1990) 4645-4649) was transformed with the ligation batches (Hanahan, Journal of Molecular Biology 166 (1983) 557-580).
      <br/>
      Insert-carrying colonies were identified using their tetracycline sensitivity after being inoculated onto LB agar plates containing 10  MU g/ml tetracycline. 8 groups, each of which contained 400 plasmids with an insert size of 9 to 20 kb, and 9 groups, each of which contained 500 plasmids with an insert size of 3 to 7 kb, were isolated by plasmid preparations (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning.
      <br/>
      A Laboratory Manual (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press) from combined clones.
      <br/>
      The E. coli panB mutant SJ2 (Cronan et al. 1982, Journal of Bacteriology 149:916-922) was transformed with this gene bank by electroporation (Wehrmann et al 1994, Microbiology 140:3349-3356).
      <br/>
      The transformation batches were plated out directly onto CGXII medium with 15 m/l agar (Keilhauer et al., Journal of Bacteriology (1993) 175:5595-5603).
      <br/>
      Plasmid DNA was isolated from clones cable of growing without supplementation with pantothenate (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning.
      <br/>
      A Laboratory Manual (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press).
      <br/>
      The ability to complement the panB defect of the E. coli mutant SJ2 in a heterologous manner was able to be corroborated in the case of 8 plasmids by retransformation.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      A restriction mapping was carried out with these 8 plasmids.
      <br/>
      One of the plasmid vectors investigated, called pUR1 in the following, contained an insert of 9.3 kb (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      The transformation of the E. coli panC mutant DV39 (Vallari and Rock 1985, Journal of Bacteriology 164:136-f142) established that the vector pUR1 was likewise able to complement the panC defect of this mutant.

    <p num="46">2. Sequencing of the panB and panC Gene</p>
    <p num="47">
      A 2.2 kb fragment of the insert (FIG. 2) of pUR1 was sequenced according to the dideoxy-chain terminating method of Sanger et al (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America USA (1977) 74:5463-5467).
      <br/>
      For this, subclones were produced at first by exonuclease III which subclones were sequenced with the aid of standard primers (universal and reverse primers of the company Boehringer Mannheim, Germany).
      <br/>
      The gel electrophoretic analysis of the sequence batches took place with the automatic laser fluorescence sequencing device (A.L.F.) of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden).
      <br/>
      The nucleotide sequence obtained was analyzed with the program packet HUSAR (release 4.0, EMBL, Cambridge, GB).
      <br/>
      The nucleotide sequence is shown as SEQ ID NO:3.
      <br/>
      Analysis resulted in the identification of two open reading frames.
      <br/>
      An open reading frame of 813 bp in length, which was identified as panB gene, codes for a polypeptide of 271 amino acids and is shown as SEQ ID NO:4.
      <br/>
      The second open reading frame, which was identified as panC gene, comprises 837 base pairs.

      The pantothenate biosynthesis genes panD from C. glutamicum and E. coli were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as synthetic oligonucleotides.
      <br/>
      The PCR experiments were carried out with the Taq DNA polymerase of the company Gibco-BRL (Eggestein, Germany) in a "PCT-100 Thermocycler" (MJ Research Inc., Watertown Mass., USA).
      <br/>
      A single denaturing step of 2 minutes at 94 (degree)  C. was followed by a denaturing step of 90 seconds at 94 (degree)  C., an annealing step for 90 seconds at a primer-dependent temperature of T=(2AT+4GC)-5 (degree)  C. (Suggs et al., 1981, pp. 683-693, in: D. D. Brown and C. F.

      The E. coli-C. glutamicum shuttle expression vector pZ8-1 (European patent 0.375,889) shown in FIG. 3 was used as base vector for the expression both in C. glutamicum as also in E. coli.
      <br/>
      The amplified products cloned previously into vector pCR.RTM.2.1 were ligated by means of the primer-inserted restriction cleavage sites into the expression vector pZ8-1 treated in the same manner and brought therewith under the control of the tac promoter contained on this plasmid.
