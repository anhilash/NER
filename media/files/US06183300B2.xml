    <p num="5">
      Receptacles which are adapted to be mounted on a PWB are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      The universal serial bus (USB) receptacle, for example, has been proposed for universal use in many computer and computer peripheral applications.
      <br/>
      In the USB there is essentially an insulative member which houses a plurality of contacts which extend horizontally then vertically to engage the PWB.
      <br/>
      A conductive shield has an upper wall which is superimposed over the horizontal section of the insulated insert.
      <br/>
      The conductive shield also has a lower wall adjacent the PWB, and the upper and lower walls are connected with the vertical side walls to form a plug receiving cavity.
      <br/>
      One disadvantage of such receptacles is that they may provide no filtering means.
      <br/>
      There is, therefore, a need for a receptacle having an integral filtering means which is adapted to be mounted on a PWB.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="8">
      Referring to the drawings, the receptacle of the present invention includes an insulative member shown generally at numeral 10.
      <br/>
      As is conventional, this insulative member includes a first vertical section 12 which extends upwardly from a base 14 to an upper side 16.
      <br/>
      The insulative member then extends horizontally in a second horizontal section 18 to a terminal front edge 20.
      <br/>
      This second horizontal section 18 includes longitudinal contact receiving slots 22, 24, 26, and 28.
      <br/>
      The insulative members also have lateral sides 30 and 32 which extend rearwardly, respectively, in rearward lateral ridges 34 and 36.
      <br/>
      On the forward side of the vertical first section there is a conductive shield retaining lip 38 which has a central clasp receiving aperture 40.
      <br/>
      Adjacent the terminal front edge of the horizontal second section 18, there is a front contact retaining lip 42.
      <br/>
      At the opposite end of the horizontal second section of the insulated member there is a rear contact retaining structure 44.
      <br/>
      It will be understood, however, that all these contacts may be signal contacts and that any one of these contacts may be either a power signal or ground contact depending on system configuration.
      <br/>
      As is also conventional, signal contacts 46 and 48 and 50 are inserted in the contact receiving grooves 22, 24 and 26 and ground contact 52 is inserted in contact receiving groove 28.
      <br/>
      Referring particularly to FIG. 5, the signal contacts include a first horizontal section 54 which has a forward terminal end 56 that is engaged by the front contact retaining lip 42.
      <br/>
      This front section also includes a convex bend 58 which extends beneath the contact receiving slot.
      <br/>
      The signal contact 50 also includes a second vertical section 60 which extends downwardly parallel to the first vertical section of the insulative member to a PWB engagement end 62.
      <br/>
      The ground 52 (FIG. 8) also includes a first section 64 which is engaged at forward terminal end 66 by the front contact retaining lip 42 as well as a convex bend 68.
      <br/>
      The ground contacts also have a second vertical section 70 which extend downwardly in parallel relation to the first vertical section of the insulative member to a terminal PWB engagement end 72.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The capacitive filter element is shown generally at numeral 74.
      <br/>
      This filter element has transverse apertures 76, 78, 80 and 82.
      <br/>
      These apertures are surrounded respectively by peripheral conductive members 84, 86, 88 and 90.
      <br/>
      There is also a conductive ground plane electrode 92 and a signal electrode 94.
      <br/>
      A dielectric 96 is interposed between these electrodes to form a capacitor.
      <br/>
      A rear shield 98 is superimposed over the filter 74.
      <br/>
      Resilient ground springs 100 and 102 extend inwardly from the rear shield to bear against the conductive plane 92 on the filter 74 to help retain the filter in place.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Referring particularly to FIGS. 10-12, the conductive shield is shown in greater detail generally at numeral 104.
      <br/>
      This shield includes a top wall 106, a bottom wall 108 and opposed lateral walls 110 and 112.
      <br/>
      The rear shield 98 will preferably be an integral part of the rest of the shield and will be bent downwardly from the top wall 106.
      <br/>
      Between the insulative member and the bottom wall there is a plug receiving space 114.
      <br/>
      The top wall includes a front flange 116, a number of rear aperture as at aperture 118 and longitudinal springs 120 and 122 which have respectively convex bends 124 and 126 that bear against the second section of the insulative member.
      <br/>
      The bottom wall includes a front flange 128 and is divided by a medial split 130 and has a rear clasp 132 which is inserted in the central clasp receiving gap 44 in the insulative member.
      <br/>
      The bottom wall also includes longitudinal springs 134 and 136 which have respectively convex bends 138 and 140 which bear against a plug (not shown) which would be inserted in the plug receiving cavity 114.
      <br/>
      The lateral walls 110 and 112 include, respectively, front flanges 142 and 144.
      <br/>
      They also include longitudinal springs 146 and 148 which have, respectively, convex bends 150 and 152 which bear against the lateral sides of the plug upon inserting as will be explained further below.
      <br/>
      The conductive shield is also equipped with hold downs 154 and 156.
      <br/>
      The lateral walls 110 and 112 of the shield also respectively have aperture 158 and 160.
      <br/>
      A non-conductive glazing 162 surrounds the ground plane electrode 92.
      <br/>
      The entire receptacle is spaced by the PWB by a stand off 164.
    </p>
    <p num="11">It will be appreciated that there has been described a receptacle which is adapted to be mounted on a PWB and which provides an integral filtering means.</p>
