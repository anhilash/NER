      Existing display panels of this type are well adapted to be visible from a distance in public places (public thoroughfares, airports, stations, shopping centres etc.) and to deliver very short advertising messages, limited for example to an image associated with a brand name and/or a slogan.
      <br/>
      However these display panels do not allow more detailed information of the corresponding product or service to be given.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">This invention is particularly intended to compensate for this drawback.</p>
    <p num="6">
      To this end, according to the invention, a display panel of the said type is essentially characterised:
      <br/>
      in that each display comprises in its surface an optically transparent window having a surface area between 5% and 70% of the surface area of the display,
      <br/>
      in that the display panel comprises at least one device for displaying images which includes a reserve of several images for each display of the display panel and which is adapted to display these images in the widow of each display (the said images may, if the need arises, be composed at least in part of text, and they may be still or animated),
      <br/>
      and in that the display panel moreover comprises control means adapted to display successively in the window of each display, by means of the image display device, the images corresponding to this display (in a predetermined order, or randomly, or yet according to the demands of the public if the display panel is made interactive).
    </p>
    <p num="7">These arrangements make it possible to give detailed information of the product or service displayed in large format on the display, this detailed information being visible to people approaching the panel after their attention has been drawn by the large format display and/or by the movement created by the succession of images displayed in the display window.</p>
    <p num="8">
      In preferred versions of the invention use may possibly be made moreover of one and/or other of the following arrangements:
      <br/>
      the surface area of the window is between 10% and 40% or the surface area of the display,
      <br/>
      the window is substantially identical and situated in substantially the same place in the various displays,
      <br/>
      the image display device includes a screen situated to correspond with the place occupied by the window of each display when this display is shown on the display surface, the reserve images of the display device including at least one animated sequence, and the control means being adapted to display this animated sequence on the screen while the corresponding display is shown,
      <br/>
      the reserve images of the image display device include several animated sequences for each display, the control means being adapted to display these animated sequences on the screen while the corresponding display is shown,
      <br/>
      the control means are adapted to display different images from among the images corresponding to each display according to the time of day,
      <br/>
      the control means are connected to an interface allowing the public to choose the images displayed by the image display device from among the different images displayed on the display surface, the control means being adapted to then display these images by means of the image display device,
      <br/>
      the interface also allows the public to choose the display shown on the display surface, the control means being adapted to then show this display on the display surface by means of the display changing device,
      <br/>
      the displays are made up of successive portions of a flexible tape, the display changing device being adapted to run this flexible tape past the display surface in order to selectively show one of the displays on this display surface,
      <br/>
      the display panel comprises sound transmission means, the control means being adapted to transmit sounds corresponding to the images displayed by the image display device by means of these sound transmission means.
    </p>

      and FIG. 4 is a block diagram of the control circuit corresponding to the display panel shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.
    </p>
    <heading>MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="10">In the various figures the same references correspond to identical or similar components.</p>
    <p num="11">FIGS. 1 and 2 show a display panel 1 which is intended to be sited in a public place, for instance in a public thoroughfare, an airport, a station, a shopping centre etc.</p>
    <p num="12">This display panel comprises an outer closed case 2 which may rest on the ground, for example by means of a stand 2a and which has at least one main face provided with a glass panel 3 (this glass panel may if the need arises replaced by a simple recess).</p>
    <p num="13">The case 2 contains a flexible tape 4, made for example of paper, or of transparent or translucent synthetic film, on the length of which several advertising or general information displays are printed or otherwise fixed.</p>
    <p num="14">The tape 4 may be moved in a direction parallel to its length by a driving mechanism 6 which includes, for example, two reels 6a and 6b on which the said tape 4 is wound, this driving mechanism being adapted to selectively place one or other of the displays 5 on the tape 4 in front of the glass panel 3.</p>
    <p num="15">As may be seen in FIG. 3, all the displays 5 on the tape 4 have the same format, and have a surface area greater than 2 m2, for example in a range of 5 to 7 m2.</p>
    <p num="16">
      In the surface of each of the displays 5, the tape 4 has an optically transparent window 7, made for example of transparent film and not printed, forming part of the tape 4.
      <br/>
      As a variant, each optically transparent window 7 could be made by a hole cut in the tape 4.
    </p>
    <p num="17">All the transparent windows 7 of the tape 4 have the same dimensions, and are situated within the corresponding image 5, occupying a surface area of for example between 5% and 70%, and preferably between 10% and 40% of the surface area of the image.</p>
    <p num="18">
      As may be seen in FIG. 2, the display panel 1 moreover comprises a video screen 8 such as a plasma or other screen placed behind the transparent window 7 of the image 5 shown to the public, which displays successive images, and particularly video sequences, corresponding to the display 5 being shown.
      <br/>
      As a variant, the video screen 8 may, if the need arises, be replaced by a small format display system capable of displaying several successive small format displays in the transparent window 7, for each display 5 shown in the aperture 3 of the display panel.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In order to ensure that the images displayed by the screen correspond to the display 5 being shown by the display panel, the display panel preferably comprises means of locating and identifying the display being shown.
      <br/>
      These means may consist for example, for each display 5, of bar codes 9 or other identification codes (see FIG. 3), these codes being read by a decoder 10 placed inside the case 2 (FIG. 2).
    </p>
    <p num="20">To advantage as may be seen in FIG. 1, the display panel 1 also broadcasts sounds (musical and/or spoken) corresponding to the images displayed by the screen 8 by means of loud speakers 11.</p>
    <p num="21">The operation of the display panel 1 is completely automatic and preferably operates by following:</p>
    <p num="22">
      a predetermined display sequence of the displays 5,
      <br/>
      and for each display 5 a predetermined display sequence of the images or video sequences on the screen 8.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Moreover, the display panel 1 may possibly comprise in addition an interface making the operation of the said panel interactive.
      <br/>
      This interface may consist for example of a keyboard 12 linked if the need arises to a small screen 13, the keyboard 12 and the screen 13 being integrated for example in the display panel stand 2a.
    </p>
    <p num="24">As a variant, the interface might also consist of a system of vocal control.</p>
    <p num="25">In addition, it should be noted that the interface 12, 13 may, if the need arises, also be used to enable the public to choose, at least to a certain extent, the display 5 shown by the display panel.</p>
    <p num="26">Finally, the display panel may, if the need arises, be adapted to make the screen 8 show different images from among the images corresponding to each display 5 according to the time of day.</p>
    <p num="27">
      As a non restricted example, FIG. 4 shows an example of a block diagram of the control circuit of the display panel 1, the said circuit includes:
      <br/>
      a central electronic unit 14 including, for example, a microprocessor or microcontroller 15 connected to or incorporating a clock 16 and a memory 17,
      <br/>
      a communication interface 18 which is connected to the microprocessor 15 and which makes it possible to programme the operation of the display panel, particularly during replacement of the tape 4 containing the displays 5, in order to store in the memory 17 the chronological sequence of the displays 5, the correspondence between the displays 5 and the images or video sequences shown by the screen 8, and the chronological display sequence of the images or video sequences corresponding to each display 5.
      <br/>
      the bar code reader 10 or other decoder linked to the microprocessor 15,
      <br/>
      possibly, the keyboard 12 and the screen 13 (or other interface means) connected to the microprocessor 15,
      <br/>
      a control circuit 19 of one or more motors of the driving mechanism 6, this control circuit being linked to the microprocessor 15,
      <br/>
      a video tape 20 or similar, also linked to the microprocessor 15, this video tape being itself linked to the loud speakers 11 and to the video screen 8, the said video tape including a magnetic tape on which images or video sequences to be shown on the screen 8 are recorded.
