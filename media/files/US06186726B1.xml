      <br/>
      An apparatus and related method are provided for converting an open-topped container into a top-emptying container.
      <br/>
      The apparatus preferably includes a cover having ground-engaging feet and a discharge opening able to be opened and closed.
      <br/>
      A coupling device is included on the cover for coupling the cover to the open-topped container.
      <br/>
      A cradle having an entry side and supports provides lateral and back support for a container-cover assembly when the cradle is inverted, in a controlled manner, by a rotationally inverting device.
      <br/>
      The cradle further includes openable end members with a spacing apart when closed, so that end movement of the container-cover assembly in the cradle, during inversion of the cradle, will be substantially eliminated.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention is concerned generally with emptying containers and particularly with placing containers is a state of readiness for emptying.</p>
    <p num="2">
      The invention has been devised with containers in mind of the type which comprise a pallet or base with four upstanding interlocked sides.
      <br/>
      Whilst this the invention has been devised with the above form of container particularly in mind it is not limited to such containers.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      When containers have to be emptied the methods adopted depend to a large extent on the contents of the container.
      <br/>
      In the case of flowable non-liquid material, such as granules, gravitational discharge is the preferred option.
      <br/>
      To facilitate this form of discharge attempts have been made to develop containers which have a bottom discharge means.
      <br/>
      For a number of reasons containers with a bottom discharge incorporated in a base or pallet forming part of the container has not found favour with users.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      An alternative is to tilt the container, usually in a tilting device on which the container is mounted, to the extent required to cause the contents to flow from the container.
      <br/>
      To provide a generally uniform rate of discharge, which is the normal requirement, the tilt of the container has to be continually adjusted.
      <br/>
      This discharge method is labour and/or time intensive and is therefore not favoured.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="9">
      In FIGS. 1 and 2 there is shown a cover 1 which includes a hood 2, of a first form, for mounting over the open top of a container.
      <br/>
      This form of hood has a receiving end 3 separated from a discharge end provided with a central discharge means 4 by a funnel shaped intermediate part 5.
      <br/>
      There is a frame 6 around the hood 1.
      <br/>
      The frame 6 includes legs 7 with feet 8 at first ends of the legs 7 and the other ends of the legs 7 are connected by a mounting ring frame 9.
      <br/>
      The frame 9 is shaped and sized to sit on the top edges of the sides of a container at the open end thereof and to embrace the sides of the container adjacent the top edges of the container sides.
      <br/>
      Braces 10 join the legs 7 adjacent the feet 8 and a pair of parallel receivers 11 respectively join pairs of the legs 7.
      <br/>
      The receivers 11 are shaped and sized to accept the tines of a fork lift truck so allowing the cover to readily raised and positioned on the open top of a container or be removed therefrom.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Clamps indicated 12 are shown diagrammatically as they can be of any suitable type.
      <br/>
      The clamps 12 allow the frame 9 to be clamped to the top of a container, preferably with a gasket between the container and the frame 9.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      FIG. 3 is a hood of the same general configuration as that shown in FIG. 1 except that the funnel part 5 is shaped to provide a side discharge means 4 rather than the centrally located discharge means of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Preferably the discharge means 4 incorporates an adjustable flow control means.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In FIG. 4 a cover 1 has been clamped to a container 13 where the container comprises a pallet base 14 with four sides 15 upstanding from the base 14.
      <br/>
      The container can be of the type where the sides 15 are demountable from the base 14 and are securable to the base and lockable together in the erect condition to provide an open topped container.
      <br/>
      The container can also be of the type where the sides 15 are linked to the base 14 allowing the sides 15 to be collapsed onto the base and raised therefrom to the erect condition shown and interlocked to form an open topped container.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In FIG. 5, the container-cover assembly has been mounted in an inverter 16 which includes a cradle support indicated 17 on which there is mounted a cradle 18 so as to be rotatable about an axis indicated 19.
      <br/>
      There is a drive means indicated 20 whereby the cradle 18 can be rotated though a predetermined arc to invert a container-cover assembly housed in the cradle.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The cradle 18 as shown is a framework generally forming a channel with an open side and open ends.
      <br/>
      The channel bottom (which forms a cradle back side) is indicated 21 and it is disposed opposite the open cradle side.
      <br/>
      The spaced apart remaining sides of the channel are indicated 22.
      <br/>
      The open ends of the cradle 18 are respectively provided with closure members 23 and 24.
      <br/>
      As illustrated the members 23 and 24 are hinged doors like members and they are provided with lock means of suitable form whereby the members 23-24 can be locked closed over the ends of the cradle.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that demountable members 23-24 could be provided as an alternative where the members 23-24 were attachable by quick connection hinge means or members 25 could be slidably mountable over the ends of the cradle.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In preparation for an inversion sequence the closure member 24 of the cradle 18 would be locked closed, as by suitable lock means indicated schematically as 26.
      <br/>
      The cradle 18 would be positioned in the orientation shown in FIG. 5 by operation of the drive means 20.
      <br/>
      In a preferred arrangement the drive means would be manually activated and would be deactivated by cradle position detectors associated with the two operative cradle orientations shown in FIGS. 5 and 6.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The container-cover assembly would be placed as shown with the base 14 resting on the closure member 24 and the assembly against the cradle back 18.
      <br/>
      To facilitate the loading of the assembly the closure member 23 would be at least partially open, as shown.
      <br/>
      A suitable means may be used to maintain a required opening of the closure member 23.
      <br/>
      The degree of opening required for loading the assembly can vary.
      <br/>
      The opening required may be quite small corresponding with a small clearance between the closure member 24 and the bottom of the base pallet 14, as can be achieved by a skilled fork lift truck operator.
    </p>
    <p num="17">The closure member 23 is then locked closed and as the spacing between the closure members 23-24 when locked closed is only marginally greater than the overall height of the container-cover assembly, the assembly will be substantially prevented from end to end movement as the cradle 18 is inverted.</p>
    <p num="18">
      The cradle 18 is then rotated in a clockwise direction to achieve the FIG. 7 condition.
      <br/>
      The rotation of the cradle is always such that the assembly is supported by the cradle back 18 during inversion.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 7 illustrates the next operation which is to release the upper closure member 24 (formerly the lower closure member) and open it as required to allow the removal of the container-cover assembly by means of a fork lift truck.
      <br/>
      The inverted container-cover assembly of FIG. 8 can be transported by the fork lift truck into operational relationship with a machine, or hopper or other use location where discharge from discharge opening 4 can be commenced.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      It is to be noted that at no time is the connection between the container and the hood subjected to lifting stresses.
      <br/>
      To load the hooded container into the inverter (FIG. 4) the lifting is done by engagement of the tines of a fork lift truck with the container base 14.
      <br/>
      From FIG. 6 it will be seen that by using the receivers 11 for the tines of a fork lift truck the container/hood assembly can be raised and removed from the cradle without any load being applied to the couplings between the hood and the container.
      <br/>
      The couplings are thus solely involved in the securement of the hood to the container.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The foregoing is a presently preferred form of the invention.
      <br/>
      It will be understood that the construction described and illustrated could be modified without departing from the inventive concepts herein disclosed.
