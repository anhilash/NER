    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention relates to a vehicle safety apparatus.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention relates to an inflatable vehicle occupant protection device, such as a side curtain assembly, for helping to protect a vehicle occupant in the event of a side impact to a vehicle.
      <br/>
      As representative of the present invention, FIG. 1 illustrates schematically a vehicle safety apparatus 10 for helping to protect an occupant of a vehicle 12.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The safety apparatus 10 includes an inflatable vehicle occupant protection device in the form of a side curtain 14.
      <br/>
      The side curtain 14 is mounted adjacent the side structure 16 of the vehicle 12, including side windows, together with a fill tube 20.
      <br/>
      The side curtain 14 is movable, upon actuation of an inflator 22, from a deflated and stowed condition (not shown) to an inflated condition as illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In its inflated condition, the side curtain 14 can help to protect an occupant of the vehicle 12 in the event of a side impact to the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The fill tube 20 (FIGS. 1 and 3-4) has an elongate configuration including parallel, cylindrical inner and outer surfaces 32 and 34.
      <br/>
      The fill tube 20 is mounted to and extends along the length of the vehicle side structure 16, and has a curved configuration to match the vehicle side structure.
      <br/>
      The fill tube 20 has a first end portion 36 for receiving inflation fluid from the inflator 22.
      <br/>
      A V-shaped notch 38 cut in the end portion 36 defines an inlet 40 into the fill tube 20.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The inflator 22 (FIGS. 3 and 4) preferably contains a stored quantity of pressurized inflation fluid (not shown) in the form of a gas to inflate the side curtain 14.
      <br/>
      The inflator 22 alternatively could contain a combination of pressurized inflation fluid and ignitable material for heating the inflation fluid, or could be a pyrotechnic inflator which uses the combustion of gas-generating material to generate inflation fluid.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The inflator 22 has a tubular configuration including an axially extending, cylindrical side wall 42 having a cylindrical outer surface 44.
      <br/>
      Two sets of inflation fluid outlets 46 and 48 are formed in the side wall 42, on diametrically opposite sides of the inflator 22.
      <br/>
      Lead wires 50 extends from one end of the inflator 22.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The inflator 22 preferably contains a stored quantity of pressurized inflation fluid in the form of gas to inflate the side curtain 14.

    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The vehicle 12 includes known means indicated schematically at 54 (FIG. 1) for sensing a collision involving the vehicle and for actuating the inflator 22 in response to the sensing of a collision.
      <br/>
      The means 54 may include a deceleration sensor and vehicle electric circuitry for actuating the inflator 22 in response to sensing a vehicle deceleration indicative of a vehicle collision having a severity greater than a predetermined threshold value.
      <br/>
      As discussed below, the means 54 provides an electric signal over the lead wires 50 to the inflator 22, when the inflator is to be actuated.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The safety apparatus 10 includes a clamp 60 (FIGS. 2-5) for supporting the inflator 22 on the fill tube 20.
      <br/>
      The clamp 60 includes first and second clamp parts 70 and 80 which are similar to each other in configuration.
      <br/>
      Each one of the first and second clamp parts 70 and 80 fits over one of the sets of inflation fluid outlets 46 or 48 in the inflator 22 and over the inlet 40 of the fill tube 20.
      <br/>
      The clamp parts 70 and 80 cooperate to direct inflation fluid from the inflator 22 to the fill tube 20, as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The first clamp part 70 (FIGS. 2 and 5) is preferably cast from aluminum or another metal.
      <br/>
      The first clamp part 70 could, alternatively, be molded from plastic or machined from metal.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The first clamp part 70 has a side wall 82 which extends over the full height (as viewed in FIGS. 2-5) of the part.
      <br/>
      The side wall 82 of the first clamp part 70 has an upper fastener portion 84, a central portion 86, and a lower fastener portion 88.
      <br/>
      The central portion 86 of the side wall 82 projects outward from the upper and lower fastener portions 84 and 88 of the side wall to form a somewhat C-shaped configuration when viewed in section through both clamp parts 70 and 80, as in FIGS. 4 and 5.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The lower fastener portion 88 of the side wall 82 is formed as a bolting flange having a planar inner side surface 90.
      <br/>
      A bolt hole 92 extends through the flange 88.
      <br/>
      A second bolt hole 94 is formed in the side wall 82, adjacent the upper fastener portion 84 of the side wall.
      <br/>
      The upper fastener portion 84 of the side wall 82 has a sealing lip 85 for engaging a complementary sealing lip 145 on the second clamp part 80 as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The first clamp part 70 also has first and second end walls 100 and 102 which, when the clamp 60 is mounted on the inflator 22, are spaced apart axially along the inflator.
      <br/>
      The end walls 100 and 102 project inward from the side wall 82 to a central plane 110 (FIGS. 4 and 5) of the assembled clamp 60.
      <br/>
      The central plane 110 defines generally the inner boundary of the end walls 100 and 102 and, thus, of the first clamp part 70.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The first end wall 100 (FIG. 2) of the first clamp part 70 has a generally planar configuration.
      <br/>
      An arcuate edge surface 112 on the first end wall 100, adjacent the upper fastener portion 84 of the side wall 82, defines a semi-circular fill tube cutout 114 in the first end wall.
      <br/>
      The fill tube cutout 114 is centered on the central plane 110.
      <br/>
      The diameter of the fill tube cutout 114 is the same as the outer diameter of the fill tube 20.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Another arcuate edge surface 116 on the first end wall 100 defines a semi-circular inflator cutout 118 in the first end wall.
      <br/>
      The inflator cutout 118 is spaced from the fill tube cutout 114 and is centered on the central plane 110.
      <br/>
      The diameter of the inflator cutout 118 is the same as the outer diameter of the inflator 22.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated embodiment, the inflator cutout 118 has a diameter of about 30 mm, and the fill tube cutout 114 has a diameter of about 16 mm.
      <br/>
      The first end wall 100 also includes a sealing lip 120 located between the cutouts 114 and 118.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The second end wall 102 (FIGS. 2 and 5) of the first clamp part 70 is a mirror image of the first end wall 100.
      <br/>
      The second end wall 102 has a generally planar configuration.
      <br/>
      An arcuate edge surface 122 on the second end wall 102, near the upper fastener portion 84 of the side wall 82, defines a semi-circular fill tube cutout 124 in the second end wall.
      <br/>
      The fill tube cutout 124 is centered on the central plane 110 and has the same diameter as the outer diameter of the fill tube 20.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Another arcuate edge surface 126 on the second end wall 102 defines a semi-circular inflator cutout 128 in the second end wall, spaced from the fill tube cutout 124.
      <br/>
      The inflator cutout 128 is centered on the central plane 110 and has the same diameter as the outer diameter of the inflator 22.
      <br/>
      A sealing lip 130 is formed on the second end wall 102, between the cutouts 124 and 128.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The first and second end walls 100 and 102 of the first clamp part 70, and the side wall 82, define a fluid flow area 132 in the first clamp part 70.
      <br/>
      The fluid flow area 132 extends between the inflator cutout 118 and the fill tube cutout 114, at one end of the first clamp part 70, and the inflator cutout 128 and the fill tube cutout 124 at the other end of the first clamp part.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The second clamp part 80 (FIGS. 2 and 5) is identical to the first clamp part 70 except that the second clamp part has sealing lips which are complementary to those of the first clamp part.

      Specifically, the second clamp part 80 has a side wall 142 which extends over the full height (as viewed in FIGS. 2-5) of the second clamp part.
      <br/>
      The side wall 142 of the second clamp part 80 has an upper fastener portion 144, a central portion 146, and a lower fastener portion 148.
      <br/>
      The central portion 146 of the side wall 142 projects outward from the upper and lower fastener portions 144 and 148 of the side wall to form a somewhat C-shaped configuration when viewed in section.
      <br/>
      The lower fastener portion 148 of the side wall 142 is formed as a bolting flange having a planar inner side surface 150.
