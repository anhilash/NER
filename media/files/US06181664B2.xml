    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a disk cartridge, a disk cassette, a disk caddy, a disk half or a disk case for housing a disk-shaped recording medium such as an optical disk, and a disk device using the same.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      A compact disk (hereinafter, referred to as "CD") system, which has been standardized in the so-called "red book", the so-called "yellow book" or the like and in which information is recorded in a disk having a diameter of 120 mm, and which is used mainly for music information has been widely adopted.
      <br/>
      This system has an almost sufficient capacity for handling music in formation, but when recording video information as in a CD-ROM, its capacity becomes insufficient for an increased amount of information, thus resulting in insufficient recording time or degraded image quality.
      <br/>
      Attempts to deal with this problem includes, for example, a digital video disk (hereinafter referred to as "DVD") system and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In the aforementioned CD system, the disk is mainly used on only one side or face for exclusive reproduction.
      <br/>
      Also, the disk is often handled in a bare state, and a tray loading system, in which the disk is mounted on a drawer-shaped tray coming out from a disk device, is mainly used because of its good operability.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, however, a disk cartridge, which is called a CD caddy, as described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 63-153376 and in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 63-47472, capable of taking a disk out and in, is used, and a front loading system for inserting this disk cartridge into the device is also utilized.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In addition, in the aforementioned DVD system, the disk is used on both sides or faces for recording and/or reproduction.
      <br/>
      The disk tends to be housed in an exclusive cartridge primarily for protection from the standpoint of securing the reliability resulting from higher density recording.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Further, in contrast to the CD system, which is mainly used for exclusive reproduction, there has also been announced a PD (Phase-change Disk) system capable of rewriting, as described in Optical Disk System for Multimedia National Technical Report, Vol. 4, No. 6, December 1994, pgs. 129-136. In this PD system, the disk is used on one side for recording and/or reproduction.
      <br/>
      Also, the disk is housed in an exclusive cartridge from the standpoint of securing the reliability resulting from rewriting.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Disks for use with each system of the aforementioned CD, DVD and PD all have a diameter of 120 mm, and cartridges for each system described above are of nearly the same shape, having the same dimensions.</p>
    <p num="8">The problem to be solved by the present invention is to increase the capacity of the CD system or a disk system having nearly the same dimensions as the CD system, and the concept and technical problems for the disk cartridge and disk device using the same to deal with the problem are described below.</p>
    <p num="9">
      1) In order to take measures against scratching, dust and dirt resulting from higher density recording, a state in which a disk has been placed in a cartridge is supposed to be a standard.
      <br/>
      Even in the CD system, there is present a case called a "CD caddy" which is about 135 mm long, about 125 mm wide and about 8 mm thick, but this CD caddy is not used currently.
      <br/>
      Rather, the so-called tray loading system is mainly used.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      2) Allowing both faces of the disk to be recorded.
      <br/>
      The CD is for one side recording and the capacity can be doubled by simple calculation.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      3) Making a disk which is CD compatible and reproducible In a disk device using a new disk cartridge, its sales point is to make the existing CD compatible and reproducible.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is an indispensable condition to enable taking a disk in and out and having a disk for CD system within.
      <br/>
      However, the CD caddy is for one-side recording, and a clamper of the disk is attached on the side of the caddy case.
      <br/>
      The clamper is constructed to be on the side of the disk device because the new disk cartridge is of a both-face recording system.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the CD caddy is mounted to a disk device for the new disk cartridge, two clampers will interfere with each other.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is necessary to prevent the CD caddy from being mounted to the disk device of the new disk cartridge.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      4) Supply of the disk and disk cartridge at a low price.
      <br/>
      In order to reduce the price for general family usage, the disk cartridge including the disk device is required to be constructed at low cost.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Further, when increasing the capacity as described above, the mixed existence of three similar disk cartridges poses the following problems.</p>
    <p num="14">5) Discrimination of disk cartridges for each system</p>
    <p num="15">6) Prevention of erroneous insertion</p>
    <p num="16">7) The system of mounting the cartridge to the device is made applicable to both the front loading system and the tray loading system.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">It is an object of the present invention to solve the above-described problems, and to provide a disk cartridge with increased capacity and capable of discrimination from similar and different disk cartridges, and a disk device using the same.</p>

    <p num="29">11) The first cutout portion is arranged laterally symmetrically with respect to the inserting direction into a disk device.</p>
    <p num="30">Each of the aforementioned items 1) to 11) acts in the following manner as described in 1) to 11), respectively.</p>
    <p num="31">1) Even when the disk cartridge, which is applicable to both faces of the disk, is turned over for insertion to apply it to both faces or sides of the disk, it is made applicable by using one shutter open-and-close mechanism, thus making the disk within the cartridge replaceable.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="44">
      Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are utilized to designate like parts, a first embodiment according to the present invention is described in conjunction with FIGS. 1 to 6, which embodiment corresponds to the so-called front loading system.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1(a)-1(d) show a disk cartridge according to the present invention, with FIG. 1(a) being a partially exploded plan view, and FIGS. 1(b), 1(c) and 1(d) being side cross-sectional views as viewed from below, from the right side and from above, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      A disk cartridge 100 according to the present invention is basically constituted by a disk 1 for recording information, a case formed by case portions 2 and 3 for housing the disk, a shutter 4 for opening and closing windows 2a and 3a in the case two springs 40 and 41 for biasing the shutter 4 and a door 5 for opening a part of the case.
      <br/>
      The disk 1 is capable of recording and reproducing a signal on both faces or sides thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The case is formed divided into two sheets represented as case portions 2 and 3 sheets which are bonded together.
      <br/>
      Each of the case portions is formed with a window 2a or 3a which exposes a part of the disk plane so as to record and reproduce information.
      <br/>
      Dust-proof barrier plates 2p and 3p are formed between the disk 1 and the springs 40 and 41.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The shutter 4 is integrally formed as a U-shaped character with shutter planes 4a and 4b corresponding to the both faces of the disk respectively, and a side portion 4c, which integrally connects both shutter planes.
      <br/>
      Projections 4p and 4q engage with a guide groove 2g linearly formed in the case so that the shutter is linearly slidable in the right and left directions in the figure.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The two springs 40 and 41 may be torsion springs which are in a stretched state or helical tension springs, and exert a biasing force so that the shutter planes 4a and 4b of the shutter 4 maintain the windows 2a and 3a at their closing positions respectively.
      <br/>
      These two springs have the same shape so as not to increase the number of the parts and enabling a cost reduction.
      <br/>
      Each of these springs shown as torsion springs is mounted at two corner regions 50 and 51, respectively, which regions are provided between the two case 2 and 3, and which laterally sandwich the shutter 4 therebetween.
      <br/>
      The leading end of the arm of each of the respective springs is bent at a right angle to the axial direction of the coil portion, and each end 40a or 41a engages with a groove portion 2d or 3d at the case corner.
      <br/>
      Also, each of the other ends 40b or 41b engages with a stopper 3p or 3q having a V-shaped cross-section (see FIG. 3(a)) formed in the case portion 3 so that the springs are positioned with high precision in the up-and-down and the right-and-left directions in the figure because they are in the stretched state as described above.
      <br/>
      In this respect, according to the present invention, the torsion spring is constructed so that both ends thereof directly engage with the case without using other parts therebetween, thus not increasing the number of parts.
      <br/>
      Hooks 4d and 4e are integrally formed with the shutter 4 in coincidence with the above-described up-and-down and right-and-left positions of the torsion springs and with a deviation in height of the disk in the direction of thickness thereof, and innermost recesses in the grooves of the hooks 4d and 4e are positioned respectively.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the shutter 4 is retained at the central position shown in the right-and-left direction, i.e., the sliding direction in the figure.
    </p>
    <p num="49">In this respect, the sides of the case portions 2 and 3 as viewed from the direction of FIG. 1(b) are constructed to be opened, through which it is possible to insert these two springs once in one direction in a bent state for use in the cartridge and representing a very excellent assembly property.</p>
    <p num="50">
      A door 5 pivotally engages with the case 2 at pivot points 5a, 5b to open so that the disk can be taken in and out as shown by dotted lines of 5c and 1a in FIG. 1(c).
      <br/>
      Since the door 5 has a portion extending in a plane in parallel to the disk plane and this portion is opened, the disk has good visibility and good taking-in-and-out property when the door is opened.
      <br/>
      In this respect, the door 5 may be constructed to open at the side of the case in a manner similar to the cartridge for an 8 cm CD-ROM which is currently on the market.
      <br/>
      Also, when a disk such as, for example, a rental disk should not be taken out of the disk cartridge, the door 5 may be eliminated for preventing removal of the disk by a renter.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The operation when the shutter opens and closes the window is described with reference to FIG. 2 and FIGS. 3(a) and 3(b).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, when the disk cartridge 100 is inserted into a disk device 200 (a downward direction in the figure), a shutter opening lever 201 of the disk device 200 is supported by a pivot shaft 202 fixed on the device side, is biased clockwise in the figure by the spring 203, and stands by in contact with a stopper 204 so that the leading end 201a of the shutter opening lever 201 abuts an end 4r of the side portion of the shutter 4.
      <br/>
      When the disk cartridge is further inserted into the interior of the device 200 from this state, the shutter opening lever 201 rotates counterclockwise in the figure so as to cause the shutter 4 to slide toward the left side in the figure.
      <br/>
      When the sliding is started, the right-hand end 40b of the left-hand spring 40 is urged against the groove in the left-hand hook 4d in the shutter, as shown in FIG. 3(a), to engage therewith and to retract from the projection 3p of the case.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, while it is remaining urged against and engaged with the projection 3q of the case, the left-hand end 41b of the right-hand spring 41 in the figure retracts from the right-hand hook 4e in the shutter with the right-hand spring 41 retained as it is.
      <br/>
      With the sliding of the shutter 4, the right-hand end 40b of the left-hand spring 40 linearly moves to be deformed within the corner region 50, as shown in FIG. 3(a).
      <br/>
      On the side portion 4c of the shutter 4, there is provided a discrimination hole 4s (as shown more clearly in FIG. 3(b)), and at the position where the disk cartridge 100 has been inserted to the innermost position, a projection 210 is provided on the side of the disk device 200 correspondingly to the discrimination hole 4s such that the insertion of the disk cartridge 100 can be completed only when the projection 210 fits in the discrimination hole 4s.
      <br/>
      Then, a sensor (not shown) detects that the disk cartridge could be inserted to the completion position, and thereafter the entire disk cartridge 100 is moved toward the revolving shaft for the disk to complete the mounting of the disk so as to enable recording and/or reproduction by the disk device.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      In the case of a CD caddy which does not have the discrimination hole 4s, the corresponding side portion 4c of a shutter 4 and the leading end of the projection 210 of the disk device collide with each other before the completion of insertion, thus preventing completion of the insertion.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the mounting of a CD caddy to the disk device is prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In this respect, according to the present invention, the disk cartridge 100 is constructed laterally symmetrically in the state of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 4(a)-4(c) and FIGS. 6(a)-6(d) are side views showing the external shape of the case portions 2 and 3 and the shutter 4.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4(a), the discrimination hole 4s is formed at the center of the side portion 4c of the shutter 4 to show a point symmetry therein.
      <br/>
      When the disk cartridge 100 is turned over for insertion, the design is such that quite the same operation, as shown in FIG. 2 or FIGS. 3(a) and 3(b), can be performed when recording and reproducing on the rear or opposite plane thereof, and the mechanism on the side of the disk device 200, as shown in FIG. 2 or FIGS. 3(a) and 3(b), is capable of coping with the both faces of the disk only by one mechanism, thus achieving the simplified structure of the device and the reduced cost.
      <br/>
      Although the discrimination hole 4s is rectangular in the present embodiment, as shown in FIG. 4(a), it may be circular or the like, as shown in FIG. 4(b).
      <br/>
      Also, if a point symmetry is shown at the side portion 4c of the shutter 4 as described above, there may be a plurality of holes, as shown in FIG. 4(c).
      <br/>
      Also, on the orthogonal plane on the front edge side of the case portions 2 and 3 in the inserting direction, there may be provided cutout portions 20a and 20b so as to show a point symmetry on the orthogonal plane on the front edge side, as shown in FIGS. 5(a) and 5(b), so that a projection 210a is fitted correspondingly thereto.
      <br/>
      In addition, the cutout portion 20 is sufficient to show a point symmetry, and such layouts, as shown in FIGS. 6(a)-6(d), may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="54">Of the case external dimensions, the width, which is a frontage dimension for insertion into the device, and/or the thickness may be smaller than those of the CD caddy as the cartridge which should be prevented from being inserted.</p>
    <p num="55">For the disk utilized for one-side recording, only one of the cutout portions 20a and 20b which corresponds to the recording surface is formed, whereby it becomes possible to discriminate from both-face recording, and to further specify which face is the recording plane.</p>
    <p num="56">As regards a combination of the cutout portion of a particular shape and a corresponding projection, all detection arrangements including, for example, the following items can be substituted if a layout thereof is arranged to show a point symmetry on the orthogonal plane on the front edge side.</p>
    <p num="57">1) A combination of a light emission diode using an optical arrangement and a light receiving element.</p>
    <p num="58">2) A combination of a MR sensor using a magnetic arrangement and a magnet.</p>
    <p num="59">3) A combination of a ultrasonic wave oscillator using an acoustic arrangement and its receiver.</p>
    <p num="60">4) A combination of a contact switch using an electric arrangement and conductive material.</p>
    <p num="61">In this respect, when the disk cartridge 100 is taken out from the disk device 200, the operation is performed conversely to the foregoing, and in FIG. 1 to FIGS. 3(a) and 3(b), the right-hand end 40b of the left-hand spring 40 returns to a state where it is urged by the projection 3p of the case portion 3.</p>
    <p num="62">The construction using a torsion spring as the biasing arrangement for the shutter in the present embodiment may be such that one helical tension spring is arranged in a region in which no disk is arranged within the case in a manner to the CD caddy which is currently on the market, and which is occupied by the shutter located in a position where the window is closed.</p>
    <p num="63">
      FIG. 7 shows a second embodiment according to the present invention, wherein this embodiment corresponds to a disk device of the tray loading system in addition to the front loading system in the previously described embodiment.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 shows a schematic external shape of the disk cartridge, and its interior and shutter structure are the same as those for the previously described first embodiment, but the disk taking-in-and-out structure is not adopted.
      <br/>
      As the discrimination arrangement and the erroneous insertion prevention arrangement in the front loading system, the cutout portions or grooves 20a and 20b structured in a manner similar to that shown in FIG. 6(a) are formed.
      <br/>
      In addition thereto, for discrimination and erroneous insertion prevention in the tray loading system, a plane parallel to the disk plane of the disk cartridge 100 is opened on both sides, and the cutout portions 302a and 302b, which pass through in its direction of thickness, are laterally symmetrically provided on the both sides correspondingly to the aforementioned cutout portions 20a and 20b respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      FIG. 8 is a perspective view of a conventional CD caddy.
      <br/>
      As shown, the conventional CD caddy 400 has no cutout portions open in a plane parallel to the disk plane.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in FIG. 9, which is a perspective view of a disk cartridge 500 for the PD system, there are additionally provided, in accordance with the present invention, cutout portions 502a and 502b where one side of a plane parallel to the disk plane of the disk cartridge 500 has been opened correspondingly to the side of the recording plane of the one-side recording disk.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 10, reference numeral 200 designates a disk device; 251, a tray thereof; and 250, a draw-in command button for giving a command to start the tray draw-in operation.
      <br/>
      In the tray 251, two projections 252a and 252b are provided at positions and shapes corresponding to the cutout portions 302a and 302b.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      FIGS. 11(a) and 11(b) show a construction in which a disk cartridge according to the present invention is mounted to the disk device with FIG. 11(a) being a plan view and FIG. 11(b) a side cross-sectional view.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 11(a), the two projections 252a and 252b provided in the tray 251 coincide with the cutout portions 302a and 302b provided in the disk cartridge 100 in both position and shape respectively for fitting in, and the tray 251 lowers to the lowest position thereof as shown in FIG. 11(b) to complete the mounting.
      <br/>
      In this state, the front of the draw-in command button 250 is accessible to permit the button to be pressed.
      <br/>
      In this respect, the disk according to the present invention can be used on both faces thereof.
      <br/>
      As described above, the projections 252a and 252b provided in the tray 251 and the cutout portions 302a and 302b provided in the disk cartridge 100 are laterally symmetrically provided respectively, and the cutout portions 302a and 302b are constructed so that the plane parallel to the disk plane of the disk cartridge 100 is opened on both sides to pass through in its direction of thickness, whereby the mounting can be completed in quite the same manner, even when the disk cartridge 100 is turned over to use its reverse side.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The construction in which the disk cartridge for the PD system, as shown in FIG. 9, is mounted is described with reference to FIGS. 12(a) and 12(b) and FIGS. 13(a) and 13(b).

      The disk for the PD system is used only on one side.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 12(a) and 12(b) show the construction when the disk cartridge is properly mounted with respect to the plane for use in the disk device with FIG. 12(a) being a plan view and FIG. 12(b) being a side cross-sectional view.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 12(a), the two projections 252a and 252b provided in the tray 251 coincide with the cutout portions 502a and 502b provided in the disk cartridge 500 in position, shape and height (depth) respectively for fitting in, and the tray 251 lowers to the lowest position thereof as shown in FIG. 12(b) to complete the mounting.
      <br/>
      In this state, the front of the draw-in command button 250 is accessible to permit the button to be pressed.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      On the other hand, FIGS. 13(a) and 13(b) show a construction when the disk cartridge of FIG. 9 has been erroneously mounted to the disk device with its plane for use reversed with FIG. 13(a) being a plan view and FIG. 13(b) being a side cross-sectional view.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 13(a), the two projections 252a and 252b provided in the tray 251 cannot fit into the cutout portions 502a and 502b provided in the disk cartridge 500 so that the upper portion thereof cannot reach the lowest position of the tray 251 in FIG. 13(b).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the mounting cannot be completed.
      <br/>
      In this state, the draw-in command button 250 is arranged so that the front thereof is rendered inaccessible by the disk cartridge 500 to prevent the button from being pressed.
    </p>
    <p num="68">In this manner,</p>
    <p num="69">1) The disk cartridge 500 cannot be accurately mounted.</p>
    <p num="70">2) Since the disk cartridge 500 is constructed to be inclined at this time, it is easy to recognize an abnormality.</p>
    <p num="71">3) The draw-in command button cannot be pressed.</p>
    <p num="72">
      By the foregoing arrangements, the operator is securely notified of the erroneous insertion.
      <br/>
      Also, the discrimination is provided ahead of the disk cartridge 500 in the inserting direction into the disk device 200, it is:
    </p>
    <p num="73">1) easy to recognize that the disk cartridge 500 cannot enter because the side of the disk cartridge near the inlet of the device is raised to deviate from the inlet; and</p>
    <p num="74">2) easy to use it also as a gripper for holding the disk cartridge 500 which is often provided in the same position.</p>
    <p num="75">
      Such effects as described above can be also obtained if in the two corner regions 50 and 51 of the disk cartridge as shown in FIG. 1(a), which are covered by the movement of the shutter 4, there are provided the discrimination arrangement, so that the discrimination arrangement is utilized for both the front loading system and the tray loading system.
      <br/>
      The remaining two corner regions of the disk cartridge can be left opened, and this leads to the effect that they can be utilized effectively and provided with a margin having, for example, a reference hole, a disk taking-in-and-out mechanism, or the like.
      <br/>
      Since the discrimination arrangement is provided at only one side with respect to of the position of the disk center, the discrimination arrangement for the front loading needn't increase the width of the disk cartridge, and this leads to the effect that the disk cartridge can be smaller in size.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      FIGS. 14(a) and 14(b) show a construction when the CD caddy 400 which must not be mounted in the tray loading system has been erroneously mounted to the disk device with FIG. 14(a) being a plan view and FIG. 14(b) being a side cross-sectional view.
      <br/>
      Even if mounted with either side of the plane turned upward, the two projections 252a and 252b provided on the tray 251 in FIG. 14(a) cannot fit in the CD caddy 400, and the mounting cannot be completed in a manner similar to that of FIG. 13(b), thus preventing the draw-in command button 250 from being pressed.
      <br/>
      Such erroneous insertion can be securely avoided.
    </p>
    <p num="77">In this respect, for all the aforementioned three types of disks, it goes without saying that the structure is arranged to prevent the erroneous insertion even when an attempt to mount the disk cartridge is made in a state where it has been rotated by 90 (degree)  or 180 (degree) .</p>
    <p num="78">
      FIGS. 15(a) and 15(b) show approximate outside dimensions of the disk cartridge according to the present invention with FIG. 15(a) being a plan view and FIG. 15(b) being a side view.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 15(a), reference numerals 150 and 151 denote the reference holes of the disk cartridge.
      <br/>
      The letter designations A-L in FIGS. 15(a) and 15(b) have the following dimensions:
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      A=125 mm
      <br/>
      B=137 mm
      <br/>
      C=115 mm

    </p>
    <p num="80">According to the present invention, it is possible to provide a mass storage disk cartridge at low cost in the CD system or the disk system having the substantially same dimensions as it, and there is also provided the effect that it is possible to securely discriminate any disk cartridge of a different type having substantially the same shape.</p>
    <p num="81">While we have shown and described several embodiments in accordance with the present invention, it is understood that the same is not limited thereto but is susceptible of numerous changes and modifications as known to those skilled in the art, and we therefore do not wish to be limited to the details shown and described herein but intend to cover all such changes and modifications as are encompassed by the scope of the appended claims.</p>
