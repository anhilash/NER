      A computer conferencing system is provided with a transmission signal synchronization scheme.
      <br/>
      An Audio signal frame has a synchronization (sync) signal.
      <br/>
      The formatted audio including the sync signal is transmitted, together with the video signal frame and data signal frame, to the remote conferencing system via a communications network, such as a PSTN.
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="11">
      A computer conferencing system can be seen in FIG. 1, for example, in which a conferencing system 100 receives, digitizes, and compresses the analog video signals generated by camera and the analog audio signals generated by a microphone.
      <br/>
      The compressed digital video and audio signals are transmitted to the other conferencing system 100' via a communications network 60, such as PSTN and ISDN, where they are decompressed and converted for play on a monitor and a speaker, respectively.
      <br/>
      In addition, each conferencing system may generate and transmit data signals to the other conferencing system for play on its monitor.
      <br/>
      Detailed hardware and software configurations of the conferencing system can be seen in U. S. Pat. No. 5,434,913 of Tung et al.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Each conferencing system 100 comprises audio board 10, video board 20, host processor 30, and communications board 50.
      <br/>
      The host processor 30 and the boards 10, 20, 50 are interconnected by an ISA bus.
      <br/>
      Reference number 40 denotes a multiplexer/demultiplexer that multiplexes compressed and formatted audio/video/data generated by the audio board 10, video board 20, and host processor 30 with the communications board 50 for transmission to and reception from the remote conferencing system 100' over the communications network 60.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      During conferencing, audio board 10 and video board 20 digitize analog audio signals and video signals received from the microphone and camera, respectively.
      <br/>
      The digital audio and video are stored in memories and they are converted into compressed audio and video format for transmission.
      <br/>
      The formatted audio and video are transmitted to the communication board 50 via the multiplexer 40 for transmission to the remote site.
      <br/>
      Also, the data generated by the host processor 30 is formatted for transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The communication board 50 also receives from the communications network 60 compressed digitally formatted audio/video/data generated by the remote site.
      <br/>
      Each data format is demultiplexed via the demultiplexer 40 and transmitted to the respective boards via ISA bus interface.
      <br/>
      Then, decompression and digital-to-analog conversion of the decompressed data are performed for local playback.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In this system, audio capture/compression and decompression/playback are preferably performed entirely within the audio and communication boards without going through the host processor 30.
      <br/>
      As a result, audio is continuously played during a conferencing session regardless of what other applications are running on host processor 30.
      <br/>
      The formatted audio or audio signal frame consists of a header AH and an audio data AD as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Also, video signal frame consists of a header VH and video data VD, and data signal frame comprises a header DH and data DD.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The audio signal frame is continuously supplied to the multiplexer 40.
      <br/>
      However, the video signal frame is supplied to the multiplexer 40 at a rate of one to five fiames per second, depends on the video processing speed of the host processor and efficiency of the compression/decoding algorithm.
      <br/>
      The data signal frame is a random supplier.
    </p>
    <p num="17">A stream of formatted audio/video/data signals is shown in FIG. 3, as an example, where in the midst of audio signal frames AF0, AF1, AF2, a video signal frame VF0 and two data signal frames DF0, DF1 are transmitted.</p>
    <p num="18">
      Such multiplexed audio, video, and data signal streams are transmitted to the remote site asynchronously via the communications network.
      <br/>
      In case of the PSTN, there occur many errors due to characteristics of the transmission line.
      <br/>
      This may result in discrepancy between the original data and the received data when demultiplexing of the compressed formatted data is performed at the remote site.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Referring to FIG. 4, there is shown a computer conferencing system in which audio, video and data conferencing between two personal computer systems is carried out in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Each personal computer system has a conferencing system, a camera, a microphone, a monitor, and a speaker.
      <br/>
      The conferencing systems communicate via a communications network.
      <br/>
      A conferencing system 100 receives, digitizes, and compresses the analog video signals generated by a camera and the analog audio signals generated by a microphone.
      <br/>
      The compressed digital video and audio signals are transmitted to the other conferencing system 100' via a communications network 160, such as PSTN and ISDN, where they are decompressed and converted for play on a monitor and speaker, respectively.
      <br/>
      In addition, each conferencing system 100 generates and transmits data signals to the other conferencing system for play on a monitor.
      <br/>
      Configuration of the other conferencing system 100' is preferably identical with that of the conferencing system 100.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Each conferencing system 100 comprises audio board 110, video board 120, host processor 130, and communications board 150.

      The host processor 130 and the boards 110, 120, 150 are interconnected by an ISA bus.
      <br/>
      Reference number 140 denotes a multiplexer/demultiplexer that multiplexes compressed and formatted audio/video/data generated by the audio board 110, video board 120 and host processor 130 with the communications board 150 for transmission to and reception from the remote conferencing system 100' over the communications network 160.

    <p num="21">
      A synchronization signal generator 112 is coupled to the compressed audio output of the audio board 110 by way of a mixer 114.
      <br/>
      In addition, a synchronization (sync) control unit 170 is coupled to audio input lines of the multiplexer/demultiplexer 140.
      <br/>
      The sync signal generator 112 generates a sync signal and supplies it to the mixer 114 which adds the sync signal to the audio signal frame generated by the audio board 110.
      <br/>
      The sync control unit 170 enables/disables addition of the sync signal to the audio signal frame.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      If the sync control unit 170 is determined to add the sync signal to the audio signal frame, the resultant audio signal frame can be exemplified by FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      There, audio sync signal AS is interposed between header signal AH and audio data AD, following the header signal AH.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      During conferencing, audio board 110 digitizes analog audio signals received from a microphone.
      <br/>
      The digital audio is stored in memory and converted into compressed audio format for transmission.
      <br/>
      The formatted audio, as shown in FIG. 5, is transmitted to the communication board 150 via the multiplexer 140 for transmission to the remote site.
      <br/>
      Also, analog video signals received from the camera and data generated by the host processor are formatted for transmission.
      <br/>
      A stream of formatted audio, video and data signals is shown in FIG. 6, for example.
      <br/>
      Audio signal frames that include the sync signal AS are denoted by AF'0, AF'1, and AF'2.
      <br/>
      In the midst of the audio signal frames, video signal frame VF0 and data signal frame DF0 are placed.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The communication board 150 also receives, from the communications network 160, the compressed formatted audio/video/data stream generated by the remote site.
      <br/>
      Each data format is demultiplexed via the demultiplexer 140 in synchronization with the sync signal included in the audio signal frame.
      <br/>
      During reception of the data stream, the sync signal of the audio signal frame responds to the sync signal generated by the sync generator 112.
      <br/>
      Demultiplexed audio, video, and data signal are transmitted to the respective boards via ISA bus interface, and then decompression and digital-to-analog conversion of the decompressed data are performed for local playback.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 7 shows another embodiment of the computer conferencing system in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The configuration of the conferencing system is similar to that of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Thus, the same or similar components are denoted by the same reference numerals as those in FIG. 4 and detailed description therefor will be omitted.
      <br/>
      In particular, each of the audio board 110, video board 120, and host processor 130 have their sync signal generator 112, 122, and 132 coupled to signal data output of boards 110, 120, and host processor 130 by way of respective mixers 114, 124, and 134.
      <br/>
      In addition, a sync control unit 180 is coupled to data input lines of the multiplexer/demultiplexer 140.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Each sync signal generator 112, 122, and 132 generates the respective sync signals and supplies them to the mixers 114, 124, and 134 which add the sync signals to the audio, video, and data signal frames generated by the boards 110, 120, and host processor 130 of the conferencing system.
      <br/>
      The sync control unit 180 enables/disables addition of a sync signal to the signal frames as well as gives priority to a sync signal provided by one of the sync generator.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      If the sync control unit 180 is determined to add the sync signal to the audio, video, and data signal frames, the resultant audio, video, and data signal frames AF', VF', DF' can be exemplified by FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      There, audio sync signal AS, video sync signal VS, and data sync signal DS are interposed between their header signal AH, VH, DH and data signal AD, VD, DD, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Further, the sync control unit 180 also controls the multiplexer/demultiplexer 140 to give priority to one of audio sync signal AS, video sync signal VS, and data sync signal DS selectively by a software module which resides and runs on host processor 130.
      <br/>
      The software application may include a table for operator selection of an operation mode for giving priority on the sync signals.
      <br/>
      An example of the mode selection table is shown below:
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      --      TABLE 1
      <br/>
      --      PRIORITY

      --      -n      User Programmable
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The system operator may choose mode number 3 in the table in order to give priority to the data sync signal DS when the data signal frame is considered most important during conferencing.
      <br/>
      The mode number 1 is preferably set to a default value since the audio signal frame normally has the priority over the other signal frames.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      During conferencing, audio board 110 digitizes analog audio signals received from a microphone.
      <br/>
      The digital audio is stored in memory and is converted into compressed audio format for transmission.
      <br/>
      Also, analog video signals received from the camera and data generated by the host processor are formatted for transmission.
      <br/>
      The formatted audio, video, and data signal frames AF', VF', DF' are transmitted to the communication board 150 via the multiplexer 140 for transmission to the remote site over the communications network 160.
      <br/>
      A stream of formatted audio, video, and data signals is shown in FIG. 9, for example.
      <br/>
      In the drawing, audio signal frames that include the sync signal AS are denoted by AF'0.
      <br/>
      Also, video signal frame VF'0 and data signal frame DF'0 that include the video sync signal VS and data sync signal DS, respectively, are followed by the audio signal frame.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The communication board 150 also receives from the communications network 160 the formatted audio/video/data stream generated by the remote site.
      <br/>
      Each data format is reconstructed via the demultiplexer 140 in synchronization with the sync signals included in any of the signal frames.
      <br/>
      During reception of the data stream, the sync signal of a signal frame responds to the sync signal generated by the corresponding sync generator.
      <br/>
      Also, the sync signal of a specific signal frame can selectively respond to the sync signal generated by the sync generator which is set to have the same priority as that in the remote site.
      <br/>
      Demultiplexed audio, video, and data signal are sent to the respective boards via ISA bus interface, and then decompression and digital-to-analog conversion of the decompressed data are performed for local playback.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      As is apparent from the foregoing, the computer conferencing system of the present invention provides for a maximization of the data integrity during conferencing due to synchronization of the most significant formatted signal transmitted over a communications link.
      <br/>
      Further, since priority for a specific formatted signal can be selected at the user level by selecting a sync signal source, user convenience and efficiency in transmission of the sync signal with the formatted signal are provided.
