      A lighting system for use with a vertical growing column (10) for optimally growing a plurality of plants in an indoor environment and enhancing the tonnage per unit area or per unit volume of product harvestable from plants positioned in these columns (10).
      <br/>
      The lighting system for use with a vertical growing column (10) includes a vertical growing column (11) having a plurality of modular planting units (12), a lighting system (104) and an apparatus (108) for carrying the lighting system (104).
      <br/>
      Each of the modular planting units (12) includes a center column (14) having a pair of lateral receptacles (16) projecting from opposed sides of the center column (14) and a mounting flange (18) extending downwardly from a lowermost portion of the center column (14) for being received within an uppermost portion of a center column (14) of another planting unit (12).
      <br/>
      The lighting system (104) utilizes sulfur lighting tubes (106) which are mounted to a vertically adjustable, movable apparatus (108) and sulfur lighting fixtures (122) which are fixably mounted to the walls, beams or related structures of a greenhouse or growing facility to insure the exposure of plants received in the receptacles (16) of the vertical columns (11) to optimal lighting conditions for maximum year-round growth potential.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to the field of vertical planters and more particularly pertains to a lighting system for use with a vertical growing column which optimizes the growth of plants which are cultivated in an indoor environment.
      <br/>
      Such plants include mature plants, seedlings, saplings and other related forms of plant growth.
      <br/>
      Moreover, vertical growing columns as discussed herein include any structure intended to enhance the tonnage per unit area or per unit volume of product harvestable from plants cultivated in these columns.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      In the field of agriculture, it is well known that planters are employed for the purpose of cultivating and supporting plants.
      <br/>
      Vertical growing columns are planters which are especially desirable for cultivating plants in an indoor environment or an outdoor environment in which conventional growing methods are disfavored.
      <br/>
      Among its other advantages, growing columns are used to facilitate volume plant growth in a minimum area.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Despite these advantages, vertical growing columns presently available are unable to achieve an optimum yield from the cultivated plants disposed within them as a consequence of impediments inherent in the construction of these columns.
      <br/>
      Chief among these defects is the overall structure of the columns which discriminates in the type and amount of light to which each plant is exposed.
      <br/>
      The quality and quantity of light to which a plant is exposed is contingent upon its position in the growing column.
      <br/>
      This disparity in light exposure results in a distinct variation in the quality of the product harvested.
      <br/>
      The variation is manifested by the gradual deterioration in product quality as the column is viewed from the top to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As the structure of these columns is essential to both the amount of a grower's growing space and the volume of a grower's crop, it is essential to overcome this critical disadvantage, without structural modification.
      <br/>
      The present invention accomplishes this objective by optimizing the quality and quantity of light received by the plants, regardless of their position in the column, and maximizing the corresponding quantity and quality of the expected yield.

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="33">
      A lighting system for use with a vertical growing column incorporating various features of the present invention is illustrated generally at 10 in the figures.
      <br/>
      The lighting system for use with a vertical growing column 10 is designed to enhance the growth potential of plants cultivated in vertical planters.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in the preferred embodiment the lighting system for use with a vertical growing column 10 is designed to optimize plant growth potential by adjustably furnishing sulfur lighting to plants regardless of disposition within the column and providing nourishment to each individual plant receptacle of the vertical planter via an external fluid dispensing system 58.
      <br/>
      The lighting system for use with a vertical growing column 10 of the present invention includes a vertical growing column 11 having a plurality of modular planting units 12, a lighting system 104 and an apparatus 108 for carrying the lighting system 104.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Each of the planting units 12 is substantially similar in construction and design and is arranged for reception within another center column 14 of another planting unit 12, thereby creating the vertical orientation illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Each planting unit 12 includes a center column 14 having a pair of lateral receptacles 16 which extend from opposed sides of the center column 14.
      <br/>
      Each lateral receptacle defines an opening 17 for receiving plants, growing media and/or plant nourishment.
      <br/>
      The lateral receptacles 16 are in fluid communication with the center column 14.
      <br/>
      The center column 14 and lateral receptacles 16 are preferably hollow to provide for fluid communication between the lateral receptacles 16 with the center column 14 such that a continuous volume of plant growing medium, such as soil or the like, may extend from a first one of the lateral receptacles 16 through the center column 14 to a second one of the lateral receptacles 16.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, each of the planting units 12 further includes a front wall 20 and a rear wall 22 spaced from the front wall 20 in a parallel orientation.
      <br/>
      The front and rear walls 20,22 are substantially identical in shape and each include a rectangular portion 24 and oppositely disposed triangular shaped wings 26, as best illustrated in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The front wall 20 is fixedly secured to the rear wall 22 and supported in the spaced, parallel orientation indicated in FIG. 3 by a plurality of side walls which include a pair of spaced upper side walls 28, a pair of medial side walls 30 and a pair of lower side walls 32.
      <br/>
