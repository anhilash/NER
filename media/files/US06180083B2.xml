      The present invention relates to tropane derivatives having particular use for the in vivo detection of dopamine transporters.These derivatives meet the formulain which R1 is I or Sn (R3)3, R2 is for example the methyl group, and X and Y are various substituents.The derivatives with X=CH3 and Y=H show strong specificity for the dopamine transporter compared with the serotonin transporter (74% inhibition when the transporter is previously saturated with GBR 12909).

    <p num="1">The present invention relates to tropane derivatives which may be radioiodinated and used as iodinated radioligands for SPECT visualization (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) of dopamine transporters at the level of the central nervous system.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which is synthetized at the presynaptic neurone where it is stored.
      <br/>
      When the neurone is stimulated, dopamine is released in the synaptic gap where it diffuses.
      <br/>
      One part interacts with the receptors of the postsynaptic neurone.
      <br/>
      This interaction produces intracellular biochemical reactions which, among others, lead to propagating the nerve signal.
      <br/>
      The major part is received by the presynaptic neurone via a transporter.
      <br/>
      Inhibition of dopamine transport, by cocaine derivatives in particular, leads to an increase in dopamine level at the postsynaptic terminal of the neurone.
      <br/>
      Anomalies in dopaminergic neurotransmission are involved in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.
      <br/>
      Given the important part played by the dopamine transporter in regulating neurotransmission, the development of radioligands emitting gamma rays able to fix themselves onto the dopamine transporter with strong affinity and selectivity is necessary for visualizing this transporter for the purpose of early diagnosis of these diseases and the assessment of :

      Nonetheless, in vitro competition studies with an Nonetheless, in vitro competition studies with an iodinated analogue of GBR 12783 (Foulon 1992) have shown a substantial loss in the affinity for the dopamine transporter.

    <p num="10">Compounds of this type are described in documents WO-A-92/02260(1), WO-A-93/09814(2), WO-A-93/18033(3), WO-A-94/04146(4), WO-A-95/11901(5), J. of Med.

    <p num="11">Among these tropane derivatives, a distinction can be made between a first family of compounds in which X of the above formula represents CH3 and Z represents a phenyl group which may or may not be substituted, and a second family of compounds in which the may be substituted by an iodine atom and Z represents a substituted phenyl group.</p>

      Among these derivatives, those of the first family in which Z represents a phenyl group substituted by an iodine atom, have undergone particular development, for example compound RTI 55 or  BETA -CIT described in WO-A-92/02260(1).

    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The object of the present invention is precisely new derivatives of tropane which have better properties than known compounds, in respect of fixation kinetics in the brain, affinity for dopamine transporters and specificity for these transporters compared with those for serotonin.
      <br/>
      Also, these new derivatives may be used to diagnose diseases such as Parkinson's disease.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Therefore the object of the invention is a compound with the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="16">
      in which:
      <br/>
      R1 represents I, a radioactive isotope of I or a group with the formula Sn (R3)3 in which R3 is an alkyl group;
      <br/>
      R2 represents H ; an alkyl group in C1 to C6 ; a phenyl group; a phenyl group substituted by a halogen atom, a methyl group or a methoxy group; a phenalkyl or phenylalkenyl group whose alkyl or alkenyl group comprises 1 to 6 carbon atoms and whose phenyl group may be substituted by a halogen atom; a cycloalkyl group in C3 to C8 or an alkynyl group;
      <br/>
      X represents H, I, F, Cl, Br, --CH3, --OCH3, --C2 H5, --CF3, --OH, --NH2, --NO2, --CN, --NCS, N3, --NHCOCH3 or --OCOCH3 ; and
      <br/>
      Y represents a hydrogen, chlorine, iodine or bromine atom, or the methyl group, provided that X does not represent F or Cl when Y represents H.
    </p>
    <p num="17">This compound is therefore a derivative of tropane in which the labeller (radioactive isotope of iodine) is fixed via a propenyl group onto the nitrogen atom of the basic tropane structure, the tropane being substituted in addition by a non-substituted phenyl group or substituted by one or two substituents.</p>
    <p num="18">Preferably, in formula (I) given above, R2 represents an alkyl group, in particular the methyl group.</p>
    <p num="19">Again preferably, in formula (I) given above, the phenyl group is non-substituted or substituted in para position by CH3, I, CF3, C2 H5 or NH2.</p>
    <p num="20">
      According to one variant of embodiment of the invention, the phenyl group comprises two substituents of which one is a halogen.
      <br/>
      For example X represents Cl or F and Y represents CH3, or X represents NH2 and Y represents Br or I.
    </p>
    <p num="21">When R1 represents a radioactive iodine atom, the latter may be 125 I, 123 I or 131 I as these isotopes are suitable for in vivo visualization of dopamine transporters at SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) owing to their relatively short radioactive period.</p>
    <p num="22">
      For this study, the compounds of the invention may be used in the form of pure isomers or a mixture of isomers.
      <br/>
      However, better results are obtained when a compound with R1 in position E is used.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      R1 may also represent the group Sn (R3) with R3 being an alkyl group preferably having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, for example the n-butyl group.
      <br/>
      Such derivatives are intermediate products of interest in the preparation of iodinated and radioiodinated derivatives.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The compounds of the invention may be prepared by conventional processes such as that described by Goodman et al in J. Med. Chem., 1994, 37, pages 1535-1542.

      This synthesis corresponds to the reaction diagram illustrated in FIG. 1.

      Owing to their specificity and their affinity for dopamine transporters, the compounds of the invention may be used in pharmaceutical and radiopharmaceutical compositions.
      <br/>
      Such compositions comprise the compound of formula (I) described above in which R1 represents I or a radioactive isotope of I, and R2, X and Y have the signification given above, and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle.
      <br/>
      In radiopharmaceutical compositions, R1 represents a radioactive isotope of I.

    <p num="26">
      These compositions may, in particular, be in the form of injectable solutions comprising from 10-5 to 10-3 mg/l of compound.
      <br/>
      For the in vivo visualization of dopamine transporters in the central nervous system, an appropriate quantity of solution may be injected into the patient to be examined, and the patient may be examined under a SPECT scanner 0.5 to 2 hours after the injection.
      <br/>
      The dose injected may be between 0.005 and 0.5  MU g per kg body weight, i.e. a radioactivity of 35 MBq to 370 MBq per injection.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="29">FIG. 1 shows the possible synthesis diagrams of the compounds of the invention.</p>
    <p num="30">
      In this synthesis diagram, an ester of anhydroecgonine 1 is used, that is caused to react with the arylmagnesium bromide corresponding to the phenyl group of the compound of formula (I) to be prepared.
      <br/>
      In this way compound 2 is obtained which is converted into compound 3 by reaction with trichloroethylchloroformate and treatment with a mixture of acetic acid and zinc chips.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Compound 3 is then converted into compound 5 either directly by reaction with 3-chloro-1-tri-alkylstannyl-prop-1-ene, or in two stages by reaction with 1-bromo-2-propyne to obtain compound 4 which is converted into compound 5 with trialkylstannyl hydride.
      <br/>
      Compound 5 may be converted into non-radioactive compound 6 by reaction with iodine in the presence of chloroform, or into a radioactive compound by reaction with sodium iodide Na125 I in the presence of an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide.

    <p num="64">In table 2 are also given two compounds of the prior art ; IPT described in documents 7 and 11, and the iodoaltropane described in documents 5 and 10.</p>
    <p num="65">EXAMPLE 14</p>
    <p num="66">In this example, in vivo tests in the rat are used to study the affinity and specificity of the compound of example 1, hereinafter called PE21, for the dopamine transporter.</p>
    <p num="67">
      For this purpose 3 batches of male Wistar rats are used using 6 rats per batch.
      <br/>
      Batch number 1 is first given an intravenous injection of GBR 12909 (specific inhibitor of the dopamine transporter produced by RBI Bioblock) at a dose of 5 mg/kg, and 30 minutes later an injection of the compound of example 1 is given by intravenous route, at a dose of 8.10-6 mg/kg.
    </p>
    <p num="68">Batch number 2 first receives an injection of paroxetine (specific inhibitor of the serotonin transporter made by Beecham laboratories) at a dose of 5 mg/kg, and 30 minutes later an injection of the compound of example 1 is given under the same conditions as for batch number 1.</p>
    <p num="69">Batch number 3, or the reference batch, only receives an intravenous injection of the compound of example 1.</p>
    <p num="70">2 hours later, the animals are sacrificed and the doses of radioactivity in the cerebellum, striatum and frontal cortex tissues are determined.</p>
    <p num="71">The results obtained are given in FIG. 2 and are expressed as a % of the dose injected per gram of tissue.</p>
    <p num="72">In this figure, the columns in white relate to batch number 3 (reference), the shaded columns relate to batch number 1 which received GBR 12909 and the dotted columns relate to batch number 2 which received paroxetine.</p>
    <p num="73">
      In this figure it can be seen that the fixation in the striatum of the compound of example 1 in accordance with the invention is prevented by 74% through a preinjection of GBR 12909.
      <br/>
      The compound of the invention is therefore specific to the dopamine transporter since a saturation of this transporter with a specific inhibitor (GBR 12909) prevents its fixation.
    </p>
    <p num="74">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="75">In this example, the same operating mode as in example 14 is followed to conduct the same in vivo brain biodistribution study in the rat, but using the compound of the prior art  BETA -CIT (3b-4-iodo�125 I�phenyl)-tropan-2 BETA -carboxylic acid methyl ester) instead of the compound of example 1.</p>
    <p num="76">The results obtained are shown in FIG. 3 using the same symbols.</p>
    <p num="77">
      In this figure, it can be seen that the fixation of the compound of the prior art in the striatum is only inhibited by 31%.
      <br/>
      This residual fixation of �125 I�- BETA CIT is therefore due to binding at sites that are not dopamine transporters, which is much greater than that obtained with the compound of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Also, in the frontal cortex which is rich in serotonin transporter sites, the fixation of the compound of the prior art �125 I�- BETA CIT is much higher than that of the compound of the invention.
      <br/>
      Also, it is inhibited by 55% through a preinjection of paroxetine.
    </p>
    <p num="79">The compound of the invention is therefore seen to have very strong specificity for the dopamine transporter compared with the serotonin transporter, which is not the case with  BETA -CIT which binds to both these transporters.</p>
    <p num="80">Also, the compound of the invention has a very strong specificity for the dopamine transporter in the striatum at early times (2 hours).</p>
    <p num="81">The non-specific fixation in the striatum determined after saturation with GBR 12909 is approximately 25%, whereas it is in the region of 70% for  BETA -CIT.</p>
    <p num="82">EXAMPLE 15</p>
    <p num="83">In this example, a biodistribution study in the rat is also conducted for the compound of example 1 following the same operating mode as in example 14, but sacrificing the animals at 1/2 hour, 1 hour or 4 hours after injection.</p>
    <p num="84">
      The results obtained are given in table 3.
      <br/>
      In this table, the results obtained in example 14 are also given.
    </p>
    <p num="85">These results show that the product accumulates in preferential manner in the striatum and that the maximum striatum over frontal cortex or cerebellum ratio is obtained for early times (between 0.5 and 1 h after injection).</p>
    <p num="86">EXAMPLE 16</p>
    <p num="87">In this example, in vitro studies are conducted on brain membrane preparations.</p>
    <p num="88">These studies are competition studies between �3 H�-GBR 12935 (dopamine transporter), �3 H�-paroxetine (serotonin transporter), �3 H�-nisoxetine (noradrenaline transporter) and the iodinated derivative of example 1 (PE21).</p>
    <p num="89">The inhibition constants Ki (nM) obtained with the compound of the invention PE21 in competition with the different ligands are given in table 4.</p>
    <p num="90">By way of comparison, table 4 also shows the results obtained with the  BETA -CIT ligand, i.e. 2 BETA -carbomethoxy-3 BETA -(4' iodophenyl)-tropane, and the results given in table I of document 10: J. Nucl. Med., 1996, 37, pages 1197-1202 for tests of the same type conducted with  BETA -CIT and iodoaltropane described in WO-A-95/11901.</p>
    <p num="91">On reading this table it is noticed that the compound of the invention PE21 has better specificity (Ki(5-HT): Ki (DA)=29.4) for dopamine transporters than iodoaltropane (Ki(5-HT): Ki (DA)=25).</p>
    <p num="92">Also, if the affinity of these two compounds is compared with that of  BETA -CIT it will be seen that the Ki ratio: DA (iodoaltropane)/DA ( BETA -CIT) is 6 whereas the Ki ratio: DA (PE21)/DA( BETA -CIT) is 0.63, which shows the better affinity (10 times more affinity) of compound PE21 of the invention.</p>
    <p num="93">Also compound PE21 of the invention has better specificity and better affinity than compound IPI of the prior art (document 11).</p>
    <p num="94">
      In document 11 the affinity constant of IPT for dopamine transporters is seen to be Kd=0.25.+- 0 (slashed zero) 02 nM (table 1) and that this affinity constant for serotonin transporters is Kd=1.2.+- 0 (slashed zero) 02 nM (page 320).
      <br/>
      Therefore a specificity Kd(5-HT)/Kd(DA) of approximately 5 is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="95">With compound PE21 of the invention, this specificity is distinctly greater since Ki(5-HT)/Ki(DA) is 29.4 as can be seen in table 4.</p>
    <p num="96">Therefore, PE21 is 5 times more specific than IPT.</p>
    <p num="97">
      The affinity of compound �125 I)PE21 for dopamine transporters was also determined in vitro, and the following value was obtained:
      <br/>
      Kd=0.09.+- 0 (slashed zero) 01 n.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      By way of comparison, the affinity of compound IPT for dopamine transporters described in document 11 corresponds to:
      <br/>
      Kd=0.25.+- 0 (slashed zero) 02 nM.
    </p>
    <p num="99">It emerges from these results therefore that PE21 has an affinity that is 2.5 times higher than the near compound IPT.</p>
    <p num="100">
      These results show the superiority of compound PE21 of the invention in relation to the nearest compounds of the prior art.
      <br/>
      Yet it was unforeseeable that replacement of a Cl or F atom by a methyl group could lead to such biological superiority.

    <p num="103">The results of this study are given in FIG. 4.</p>
    <p num="104">In this figure it can be seen that the compound of example 1 binds itself in specific manner at the central grey nuclei and that an image of these structures is obtained between 1 hour and 2 hours after injection.</p>
    <p num="105">On the hand, the compound of the prior art  BETA -CIT only starts producing a specific image of these structures after 20 hours.</p>
    <p num="106">The compound of the invention is therefore of great interest for the in vivo visualization of the dopamine transporter system.</p>
    <p num="107">EXAMPLE 18</p>
    <p num="108">
      In this example, the compound of example 1 PE21 was tested in the rat using a model of Parkinson's disease obtained with a unilateral lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway.
      <br/>
      For this purpose Wistar rats were unilaterally perfused in the substantia nigra with 8  MU g of 6-OHDA(6-hydroxy dopamine).
    </p>
    <p num="109">Three weeks later, they were given an intravenous 3.7 MBq injection of �125 I�PE21.</p>
    <p num="110">
      Two hours afterwards, the rats were sacrificed and their brains collected.
      <br/>
      The latter were frozen and coronal sections 20  MU m thick were taken which were exposed on  BETA -max hyperfilm for six weeks.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      The striatum/frontal cortex ratios were calculated after analysis of the films.
      <br/>
      On the lesion side, an average ratio of 0.86.+- 0 (slashed zero) 10 was observed, while this ratio was 7.20.+- 0 (slashed zero) 91 on the intact side.
    </p>
    <p num="112">These results obtained on ex vivo autoradiographs show that PE21 is suitable for the in vivo detection of specific lesions of dopaminergic cells.</p>
