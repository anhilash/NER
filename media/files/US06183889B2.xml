    <p num="8">
      With rapid progress in development of information devices, gauging devices, and control devices, magneto-detective elements, which have a smaller size, higher sensitivity and more rapid response than conventional magnetic-flux type elements, have been required.
      <br/>
      Elements having a magneto-impedance effect, i.e., magneto-impedance elements (hereinafter referred to as MI elements) have attracted attention.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The magneto-impedance effect indicates a phenomenon causing a change in impedance in, for example, a closed circuit as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      When an alternating current Iac having a MHz band is applied to a wire or ribbon magnetic material Mi through an electrical power source Eac while an external magnetic field Hex of several gausses is applied in the longitudinal direction of the magnetic material Mi, a voltage Emi by an impedance inherent in the magnetic material occurs between two ends of the magnetic material Mi, and its amplitude varies within a range of several tens percent in response to the intensity of the external magnetic field Hex.
      <br/>
      Since the MI element is sensitive to an external magnetic field in the longitudinal direction of the element, the sensitivity for detecting a magnetic field does not deteriorate when the length of the sensor head is 1 mm or less.
      <br/>
      The MI element enables fabrication of a very weak magnetic field sensor having a high resolution of 10-5 Oe or more and excitation at several MHz or more, hence a high-frequency magnetic field of 200 MHz to 300 MHz can be used as a carrier for frequency modulation, and thus the cutoff frequency of the magnetic field sensor can be easily set to 10 MHz or more.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the MI element is expected to be used in novel ultra-compact magnetic heads and sensors for very weak magnetic fields.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Known materials having MI effects include, for example, (1) amorphous ribbons of Fe--Si--B type alloys, e.g. Fe78 Si9 B13, and (2) amorphous wires of Fe--Co--Si--B system alloys, e.g. (Fe6 Co94)72.5 Si12.5 B15 (Kaneo Mouri et al., "Magneto-Impedance (MI) Elements", Papers of Technical Meeting on Magnetics, MAG-94 (1994), Vol. 1, No. 75-84, pp. 27-36, IEE JAPAN).</p>
    <p num="11">
      The Fe--Si--B system and Fe--Co--Si--B system alloys have problems when they are used as MI elements.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 6, when an output voltage Emi (mV) to a positive or negative magnetic field is measured, the Fe--Si--B system alloy i has low sensitivity for detecting the magnetic field, and thus a high amplitude of about 100 times is required.
      <br/>
      The element, therefore, cannot be used as a magnetic field sensor with a high sensitivity because of noise generation.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, although the Fe--Co--Si--B system alloy ii has a sufficiently high sensitivity, as shown in FIG. 6, it has a steep increase in the sensitivity within a range from -2 Oe to +2 Oe.
      <br/>
      As a result, it cannot be used as a sensing element for a very weak magnetic field due to non-quantitative measurement within the range.
      <br/>
      Although it can be used in magnetic field regions of 2 Oe or more as the absolute value, a coil must be provided to apply a considerable amount of current which is required for such a large bias magnetic field.

      Recently, further miniaturization and further improvement in recording density have been required in magnetic recording units, such as hard disk drives as external memory units, digital audio tape recorders, and digital video tape recorders.
      <br/>
      Development of high performance magnetic heads is essential for such requirements, and magnetic reproduction heads using magnetoresistive elements (hereinafter referred to as MR elements) have been developed.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Since a magnetic head having a MR element does not have a dependence of a relative velocity to the recording medium, it is suitable for reading recorded signals at a low relative velocity.
      <br/>
      It has a low sensitivity to output signals because of a low change rate in response to a change in the recorded magnetization on the recording medium.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it will be difficult to satisfy future demands for high-density recording.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Under the above-mentioned circumstances, MI elements have recently attracted attention.
      <br/>
      As described above, conventional MR elements have a magneto-detective sensitivity of about 0.1 Oe, whereas the MI elements having magneto-impedance effects can detect a magnetization of 10-5 Oe and are expected to be applied to high-sensitivity magnetic heads.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      A typical conventional magnetic sensor of a magnetic head using the MI element will now be described with reference to the drawings.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 28A and 28B, a magnetic head 201 has a pair of cores 202a and 202b composed of ferrite as a ferromagnetic oxide, and a MI element 205 as a magnetic material which is bonded to the cores 202a and 202b with a bonding glass 203 interposed therebetween.
      <br/>
      The MI element 205 is magnetically coupled with the cores 202a and 202b.
      <br/>
      That is, the ends 205a and 205b in the longitudinal direction of the MI element 205 are bonded to the magnetic circuit connecting faces 203a and 203b of the cores 202a and 202b, respectively.
      <br/>
      An insulating layer is formed on the magnetic circuit connecting faces 203a and 203b.
      <br/>
      The cores 202a and 202b and the MI element 205 thereby form a closed magnetic circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The bonding glass 203 is composed of a nonmagnetic material, prevents direct magnetic coupling between the paired cores 202a and 202b, and is bonded to the lower faces of the cores 202a and 202b.
      <br/>
      A magnetic gap G is provided between the cores 202a and 202b.
      <br/>
      A regulating groove 204 is provided on the magnetic gap G for regulating the track width of the magnetic gap G, and filled with glass which is a nonmagnetic material.
      <br/>
      Conductive films composed of Cu, Au, or the like is deposited to form terminals 206a and 206b on the two ends of the MI element 205 in the longitudinal direction.
      <br/>
      The terminals 206a and 206b are each connected to a lead 207 for extracting output signals and a lead (not shown in the drawings) for applying an alternating current.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The magnetic head 201 operates as follows.
      <br/>
      An external magnetic field by the recorded magnetization on a recording medium not shown in the drawing invades the cores 202a and 202b through the magnetic gap G and is applied to the MI element 205.
      <br/>
      An alternating current having a MHz band has been previously applied to the MI element 205 to generate a voltage between both ends of the MI element 205 by the impedance inherent in the MI element.
      <br/>
      The amplitude of the voltage varies within a range of several tens percent in response to the intensity of the external magnetic field and is extracted as output signals through the lead 207.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The magnetic head 201 using the MI element 205 has a significantly high change in the extracted voltage for a very weak external magnetic field of several gausses which is applied to the MI element 205 from the recording medium, hence the magnetic head 201 can have high sensitivity.
      <br/>
      Further, such high sensitivity permits reduction in the effective cross-sectional area of the magnetic flux in the magnetic circuit, and thus reduction in the size of the cores 202a and 202b, resulting in miniaturization of the magnetic head 201.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Conventional materials used for MI elements are amorphous ribbons composed of Fe--Si--B system alloys, e.g. Fe78 Si9 B13 and amorphous wires composed of Fe--Co--Si--B system alloys, e.g. (Fe6 Co94)72.5 Si12.5 B15. A magnetic head 201 using a MI element 205 composed of the Fe78 Si9 B13 alloy, however, produce a low output voltage from the MI element 205 for the applied external magnetic field.
      <br/>
      Thus, the output signals must be amplified by about 100 times.
      <br/>
      The element, therefore, cannot produce high quality output signals because of noise generation during the amplification.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      On the other hand, a magnetic head 201 using a MI element 205 composed of the (Fe6 Co94)72.5 Si12.5 B15 alloy produces a high voltage from the MI element 205 for the applied external magnetic field, resulting in a low amplification of the output signals.
      <br/>
      The output voltage, however, steeply and nonquantitatively varies within the very weak external magnetic field range from -2 Oe to +2 Oe.
      <br/>
      As a result, the MR element cannot be used as a magnetic field detecting element of the magnetic head.
      <br/>
      Although it can be used in a magnetic field region of 2 Oe or more as the absolute value, a coil must be provided to apply a considerable amount of current which is required for such a large bias magnetic field.
      <br/>
      When the bias magnetic field is applied from a permanent magnet having a magnetization of about 2 Oe, a complicated configuration of the magnetic head 201 is unavoidable.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In the Fe78 Si9 B13 and (Fe6 Co94)72.5 Si12.5 B15 alloys, since a temperature region  DELTA Tx of the supercooling liquid is narrow, these must be quenched at a cooling rate of 105 (degree)  C./second by a single roll process to form amorphous alloys.
      <br/>
      Thus, only a thin ribbon having a thickness of 50  MU m or less is obtainable.
      <br/>
      Fine working is necessary if these alloys are used for magnetic heads, resulting in increased production costs of the magnetic heads.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The present inventors have developed various types of alloys.
      <br/>
      One of them is a glassy alloy.
      <br/>
      Some multi-element alloys are known as glassy alloys having a wide temperature region in the supercooling liquid before crystallization.
      <br/>
      It is also known that glassy alloys can be obtained as a bulk having a thickness which is significantly larger than that of a thin ribbon of the amorphous alloy produced by a known liquid quenching process.
      <br/>
      Known glassy alloys have the following compositions, for example, Ln--Al--TM, Mg--Ln--TM, Zr--Al--TM, Hf--Al--Tm, and Ti--Zr--Be--TM, wherein Ln represents a rare earth element and TM represents a transfer metal.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Although these glassy alloys show a supercooling liquid state, the temperature region  DELTA Tx, that is, the difference (Tx -Tg) between the crystallization temperature (Tx) and the glass transition temperature (Tg) is small.
      <br/>
      Thus, these alloys have poor formability of glassy alloys which is insufficient for practical use.
      <br/>
      An alloy having a wide temperature region of the supercooling liquid state and enabling the formation of a glassy alloy by cooling metallurgically attracts considerable attention, since it can overcome the restriction regarding the thickness in conventional amorphous alloy ribbons.
      <br/>
      An alloy having a large difference  DELTA Tx enables a wide variety of deposition conditions in alloy thin film production processes, such as sputtering, and thus has industrial advantages.
      <br/>
      The alloy must, however, have ferromagnetic characteristics at room temperature before industrial use.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      No glassy alloys having ferromagnetic characteristics at room temperature, however, have been known, hence their industrial application as magnetic materials has been limited.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, development of glassy alloys having ferromagnetic characteristics at room temperature and capable of forming a thick bulk has been in progress.

    <p num="25">Azimuth sensors can measure the direction of the magnetic flux of an external magnetic field such as geomagnetism, and have been widely used as sensors for vehicle compasses and navigation systems which detect the location of vehicles.</p>

      Among the azimuth sensors, since a flux gate sensor shows excellent stability according to its operational principle and a high sensitivity of 10-7 to 10-6 G, it has been widely used.

      <br/>
      The azimuth sensor has a simplified shape and will be easily miniaturized.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      An azimuth sensor using conventional MR elements, however, has a small rate of change in inherent resistance of 3% to 6% to the intensity of the external magnetic field.

      As a result of the trend towards high definition of CAD image information, the pitch of shadow mask holes in a display having a CRT tube (hereinafter referred to as a CRT display) has become finer.

      For example, a CRT display having a screen size of 14 inches has a pitch of 0.28 mm/mask.
      <br/>
      In such a high definition screen, electron beams in the CRT tube deviate from the objective lines by the effect of an external magnetic field such as geomagnetism, resulting in deterioration of image quality, e.g. distorted images, and uneven colors.
      <br/>
      Current CRT displays, therefore, have autocancelers for canceling the effect of the geomagnetism.
      <br/>
      The autocanceler has a canceling coil for applying a magnetic field having the reverse vector to the magnetic field of the geomagnetism, that is, a canceling magnetic field to the CRT tube, and a controller for controlling the vector of the canceling magnetic field.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="74">A glassy alloy constituting a MI element in accordance with the present invention contains the following three essential components.</p>
    <p num="75">A. Basic metal: at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Fe, Co and Ni.</p>
    <p num="76">B. Additional metal (M): at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Zr, Nb, Ta, Hf, Mo, Ti and V.</p>

    <p num="80">
      Accordingly, the composition in accordance with the present invention is represented by the following formula:
      <br/>
      (Fe1-a-b Coa Nib)100-x-y Mx By
    </p>
    <p num="81">wherein M is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Zr, Nb, Ta, Hf, Mo, Ti and V. The formula preferably satisfies 0 &lt;= a &lt;= 0.29, 0 &lt;= b &lt;= 0.43, 5 atomic percent &lt;= x &lt;= 20 atomic percent, and 10 atomic percent &lt;= y &lt;= 22 atomic percent.</p>
    <p num="82">It is preferred that the glassy alloy contains Zr as an essential component and the temperature region of the supercooling liquid  DELTA Tx (=Tx -Tg) be 25 (degree)  C. or more, wherein Tx, and Tg are the crystallization temperature and glass transition temperature, respectively, of the glassy alloy.</p>
    <p num="83">It is more preferable that  DELTA Tx be 60 (degree)  C. or more.</p>
    <p num="84">The formula (Fe1-a-b Coa Nib)100-x-y Mx By more preferably satisfies 0.042 &lt;= a &lt;= 0.29, and 0.042 &lt;= b &lt;= 0.43.</p>
    <p num="85">
      The composition of another embodiment of the glassy alloy in accordance with the present invention is represented by the following formula:
      <br/>
      (Fe1-a-b Coa Nib)100-x-y-z Mx By Tz
    </p>
    <p num="86">wherein M is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Zr, Nb, Ta, Hf, Mo, Ti and V; T is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Cr, W, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt, Al, Si, Ge, C and P; and the formula satisfies 0 &lt;= a &lt;= 0.29, 0 &lt;= b &lt;= 0.43, 5 atomic percent &lt;= x &lt;= 20 atomic percent, 10 atomic percent &lt;= y &lt;= 22 atomic percent, and 0 atomic percent &lt;= z &lt;= 5 atomic percent.</p>
    <p num="87">The formula (Fe1-a-b Coa Nib)100-x-y-z Mx By Tz preferably satisfies 0.042 &lt;= a &lt;= 0.29, and 0.042 &lt;= b &lt;= 0.43.</p>
    <p num="88">The element M may be represented by the formula (M'1-c M"c), wherein M' is at least one of the elements Zr and Hf, and M" is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Nb, Ta, Mo, Ti and V.</p>
    <p num="89">The formula may satisfy 0.2 &lt;= c &lt;= 0.4, or 0 &lt;= c &lt;= 0.2.</p>
    <p num="90">The formula more preferably satisfies 0.042 &lt;= a &lt;= 0.25, and 0.042 &lt;= b &lt;= 0.1.</p>
    <p num="91">
      The glassy alloy in accordance with the present invention may be subjected to heat treatment at 427 (degree)  C. (700 K) to 627 (degree)  C. (900 K).
      <br/>
      The glassy alloy treated within this temperature range has high permeability.
      <br/>
      Since rapid cooling after the treatment causes precipitation of the crystal phase, it is preferable that the cooling rate after the treatment be as low as possible in order to form an amorphous phase.
      <br/>
      Thus, slow cooling or annealing of the glassy alloy after the treatment is preferred.
      <br/>
      In the formula, C may be substituted for 50 atomic percent or less of B.
    </p>
    <p num="92">Grounds of the Limitation of the Composition</p>
    <p num="93">
      In the glassy alloy in accordance with the present invention, a composition containing a larger content of Fe as the main component has a trend towards a larger  DELTA Tx, and optimized contents of Co and Ni in the composition can achieve a  DELTA Tx of 60 (degree)  C. or higher.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that the Co content lies within the range of 0 &lt;= a &lt;= 0.29 and the Ni content lies within the range of 0 &lt;= b &lt;= 0.43 to ensure a  DELTA Tx of 50 (degree)  C. to 60 (degree)  C. It is preferable that the Co content lies within the range of 0.042 &lt;= a &lt;= 0.29 and the Ni content lies within the range of 0.042 &lt;= b &lt;= 0.43 to ensure a  DELTA Tx of 60 (degree)  C. or more.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      The Co content preferably lies within the range of 0.042 &lt;= a &lt;= 0.25 in order to achieve excellent magnetic impedance.
      <br/>
      Also, the Ni content preferably lies within the range of 0.042 &lt;= b &lt;= 0.1 for the same purpose.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      M is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Zr, Nb, Ta, Hf, Mo, Ti and V. These elements are effective for the formation of the amorphous phase.
      <br/>
      The content of the element M is preferably 5 atomic percent or more and 20 atomic percent or less, and more preferably 5 atomic percent or more and 15 atomic percent or less.
      <br/>
      Among these elements, Zr is particularly effective.
      <br/>
      Nb can substitute for a part of Zr within a range which satisfies 0 &lt;= c &lt;= 0.6 in order to achieve a higher  DELTA Tx.
      <br/>
      The Nb content satisfying 0.2 &lt;= c &lt;= 0.4 can achieve a significantly high  DELTA Tx of 80 (degree)  C. or more.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      B (boron) has high formability of the amorphous phase.
      <br/>
      B is added within a range of 10 atomic percent or more and 22 atomic percent or less in the present invention.
      <br/>
      A content of B which is less than 10 atomic percent causes extinction of the  DELTA Tx, whereas a content of B which is higher than 22 atomic percent does not cause the formation of the amorphous phase.
      <br/>
      A content of B which is 16 atomic percent or more and 20 atomic percent or less causes more satisfactory formation of the amorphous phase and more satisfactory magneto-impedance effects.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      The glassy alloy may contain at least one element selected from the group consisting of Cr, W, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt, Al, Si, Ge, C and P. These elements can be added within a range of 0 to 5 atomic percent.
      <br/>
      Although these elements are added for the purpose of improvement in corrosion resistance, the addition over the range causes undesirable deterioration of the formability of the amorphous phase.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Examples of preferred glassy alloys which can be used as MI elements in accordance with the present invention are as follows:
      <br/>
      Fe56 Co7 Ni7 Zr8 Nb2 B20  (1)
      <br/>
      Fe56 Co7 Ni7 Zr6 Nb4 B20  (2)
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      The glassy alloy in accordance with the present invention must have a temperature range of the supercooling liquid  DELTA Tx of 20 (degree)  C. or more and preferably 50 (degree)  C. or more.
      <br/>
      For example, the glassy alloy represented by the formula (1) has a crystallization temperature Tx of 910 (degree)  C., a glass transition temperature Tg of 850 (degree)  C., and thus a temperature region of the supercooling liquid  DELTA Tx (=Tx -Tg) of 60 (degree)  C., wherein these temperatures are determined at a heating rate of 10 (degree)  C./min by a thermal mechanical analyzer (TMA) using a test piece having a length of 10 mm and a cross-section of 0.023 mm2, as shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      The glassy alloy composition satisfying this condition has a sufficiently wide temperature range of the supercooling liquid  DELTA Tx, which is a transitional region between the crystallization temperature Tx and the glass transition temperature Tg and has high formability of the amorphous phase.
      <br/>
      As a result, an amorphous ribbon or bulk having a relatively large thickness or an amorphous wire having a large diameter can be formed by some methods, which will be described later.
      <br/>
      Thus, MI elements having different shapes can be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      For example, a ribbon is formed of a glassy alloy represented by the formula (2) and is mounted as a magnetic material, that is, the magnetic material Mi in the measuring circuit shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      When an external magnetic field Hex is applied in the longitudinal direction of the MI element while an alternating current of 3 MHz is applied, the output voltage (Eme) straightly and symmetrically increases as the external magnetic field increases or decreases from zero.
      <br/>
      Thus, the MI element has magneto-impedance effects with excellent linearity.
      <br/>
      The MI element represented by the formula is more sensitive than a conventional glassy alloy represented by Fe78 Si19 B13, and thus a sensing circuit using the MI element in accordance with the present invention can be used with a low amplification which can suppress noise generation.
      <br/>
      Further, the MI element shows a moderate increase in the output voltage within a very weak magnetic field (-2 Oe to +2 Oe) compared with another conventional glassy alloy represented by (Fe6 Co94)72.5 Si12.5 B16, and is highly quantitative.
      <br/>
      The sensitivity is highly symmetric and linear in response to both positive and negative magnetic fields, a magnetic sensing circuit with a simplified configuration can be fabricated.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the MI element in accordance with the present invention is suitable for a magnetic sensing element.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      A glassy alloy is produced from the above-mentioned composition as follows.
      <br/>
      The powdered constituents are mixed based on a given composition, and the mixture is melted in an arc-melting unit in an inert gas atmosphere of Ar or the like to form a mother alloy having the given composition.
      <br/>
      The mother alloy is heated to a temperature which is higher than the melting point of the alloy and solidified by a single roll process or a melt spinning process.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Since the glassy alloy in accordance with the present invention has a wide temperature range of the supercooling liquid  DELTA Tx of 20 (degree)  C. or more, and preferably 50 (degree)  C. or more, an amorphous solid is obtainable without quenching which is essential for conventional glassy alloys.
      <br/>
      A thin film can also be produced by a conventional quenching process, such as a single roll process.
      <br/>
      In addition, products having a considerable thickness, such as ribbons and wires, can be produced by a casting process or a liquid cooling process.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      In the single roll process, a melt having a given composition is sprayed to quench onto a rotating metallic roll.
      <br/>
      A ribbon glassy alloy is thereby obtained.
      <br/>
      A ribbon having a relatively high thickness is obtained from the glassy alloy composition in accordance with the present invention by employing a moderated cooling rate.
      <br/>
      A wide temperature range of the supercooling liquid  DELTA Tx in the glassy alloy of the present invention enables a forming process by annealing or slow cooling, such as a casting process using a copper mold.
      <br/>
      Other general casting apparatuses such as a continuous casting unit can also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      A MI element wire can be produced using the glassy alloy composition in accordance with the present invention by, for example, a liquid cooling process as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 4-323351. In this process, the alloy composition is melted and continuously sprayed into a cooling liquid to solidify the melt into a wire.
      <br/>
      The liquid cooling processes are classified into a jetting process which jets the cooling liquid, a centrifugal process, and a melt spinning process which will be described later.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      In the jetting process, as shown in FIG. 3, a cooling liquid L in a liquid reservoir 5 is pressurized by a pressurizing pump 6, cooled to a given temperature by a cooler 7, and pressurized to a given pressure by a pressurizing pump 10.
      <br/>
      The pressurized liquid L is jetted through a jetting nozzle 1 at a given rate to form a jet stream 8 towards the liquid reservoir 5.
      <br/>
      The alloy composition 12 is melted in a heating oven 11, fed into a melt jetting unit 2, and jetted from the melt-jetting unit 2 by means of a gaseous argon pressure.
      <br/>
      The jetted alloy stream 9 is rapidly cooled by the jet stream 8 of the cooling liquid from the jetting nozzle 1 to form a MI element wire 3.
      <br/>
      The resulting MI element wire 3 is wound on a winding machine 4.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      In the centrifugal process, as shown in FIG. 4, the alloy composition is fed into a crucible 21 through a feeding port 31 by gaseous argon, and melted in a heating oven while rotating a drum 26 at a given rotation rate by a driving motor not shown in the drawing.
      <br/>
      A cooling liquid L is supplied onto an inner face of the drum 26 through a cooling solution feeding pipe 30 to form a cooling liquid layer 28 by means of a centrifugal force.
      <br/>
      A nozzle 22 of the crucible 21 is lowered so as to approach the surface of the cooling liquid layer 28 and the melt 24 is jetted onto the surface of the cooling liquid layer 28, while feeding an inert gas into the crucible 21 in order to prevent the melted alloy from oxidizing.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      The alloy jetted onto the surface of the cooling liquid layer 28 is solidified to form a MI element wire 33, and is wound along the inner wall of the drum 26 by the jetting force, the rotation of the drum and the centrifugal force.
      <br/>
      After completion of the spinning, the tip of the cooling solution feeding pipe 30 is lowered into the cooling liquid layer 28 to remove the cooling liquid by suction.
      <br/>
      The drum 26 is stopped to remove the MI element wire 33 from the drum 26.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      The following are possible theoretical grounds for illustrating that the glassy alloy forming the MI element of the present invention has high formability of the amorphous phase, but not for limiting the present invention.
      <br/>
      Since the composition is composed of elements having a large difference in atomic diameter and a negative heat of mixing, the liquid state has a highly disordered packing structure.
      <br/>
      As a result, the solid/liquid interfacial energy increases so as to suppress the formation of crystal nuclei in the liquid phase.
      <br/>
      Further, the highly disordered packing structure inhibits long-distance diffusion of atoms which is essential for the formation of the crystal phase.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      The MI element of the glassy alloy in accordance with the present invention has soft magnetism, and is sensitive to a change in the magnetic field in the longitudinal direction of the MI element as in generally used MI elements.
      <br/>
      A coil for a magnetic sensor head prepared using the glassy alloy is excited in the circumferential direction by leading a current, whereas the demagnetizing field caused by a magnetic field in the longitudinal direction of the head is significantly small.
      <br/>
      Thus, the head length can be significantly reduced compared with high-sensitivity magnetic flux detecting type magnetic sensors such as a flux gate sensor.
      <br/>
      Further, the magnetic sensor head has a rate of change in impedance of several tens %/Oe to 100%/Oe, a high resolution of 10-6 Oe, and a cutoff frequency of several MHz.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a magnetic sensor head having high sensitivity and a significantly reduced size can be produced.
      <br/>
      For example, a significantly small head length of 1 mm or less does not cause deterioration of the sensitivity for detecting a magnetic field, and can detect a minimum magnetic field of 10-6 for an alternating current magnetic field of 1 Hz or more.
      <br/>
      Thus, it can clearly detect a surface magnetic field (approximately 0.1 Oe at a position approximately 2 mm distant from the surface) of a ring magnet for a rotary encoder having a diameter of 19 mm and thousand poles (magnetization distance: approximately 60  MU m) at a position 1 mm or more distant from the surface.
      <br/>
      Further, it can readily detect geomagnetism (approximately 0.3 Oe).

      <br/>
      Among magnetoresistive reading heads (MR heads), giant magnetoresistive (GMR) heads using a spin-dependent scattering phenomenon of conductive electrons have been known.
      <br/>
      As an example of the GMR heads, a spin-valve head having high magnetoresistive effects for a weak external magnetic field is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,159,513.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      The MR element shown in FIG. 15 is of a spin-valve type.
      <br/>
      A free ferromagnetic layer 101, a nonmagnetic interlayer 102, a pinned ferromagnetic layer 103 and an antiferromagnetic layer 104 are deposited on a substrate.
      <br/>
      Magnet layers 105 and 105 composed of Co--Pt are provided on both sides of the composite, and electrode layers 106 and 106 are provided thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      In the configuration shown in FIG. 15, a relatively large biasing magnetic field is required for fixation of the magnetization vector in the pinned ferromagnetic layer 103 in the Z direction.
      <br/>
      A higher biasing magnetic field is preferred.
      <br/>
      The biasing magnetic field must be at least 100 Oe to overcome the demagnetizing field in the Z direction and to prevent perturbation of the magnetization vector by the magnetic flux from a recording medium.
      <br/>
      As the biasing magnetic field, an anisotropic exchange coupling magnetic field is used, which is formed by contact of the pinned ferromagnetic layer 103 with the antiferromagnetic layer 104.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      In the configuration shown in FIG. 15, the magnet layers 105 and 105 apply a longitudinal bias that is parallel to the free ferromagnetic layer 101 so that the magnetization vector is oriented in the track direction, while a bias is applied in the Z direction perpendicular to the magnetization vector in the free ferromagnetic layer 101 so that the magnetization vector in the pinned ferromagnetic layer 103 is oriented in the Z direction.
      <br/>
      The longitudinal bias can reduce Barkhausen noise which is caused by the formation of many magnetic domains in the free ferromagnetic layer 101.
      <br/>
      Thus, the resistance smoothly changes in response to the magnetic flux from the magnetic recording medium with reduced noise.
    </p>
    <p num="166">
      The magnetization vector in the pinned ferromagnetic layer 103 must not change by a magnetic flux (in the Z direction in FIG. 15) from the magnetic recording medium, whereas the vector in the free ferromagnetic layer 101 changes within 90 +-  THETA  (degree)  with respect to the magnetization vector in the pinned ferromagnetic layer 103.
      <br/>
      The linear responsiveness of the magnetoresistive effects is achieved in such a manner.
    </p>
    <p num="167">As described above, a spin-valve MR head having excellent linear responsiveness and reduced Barkhausen noise is achieved by using a bias of the pinned ferromagnetic layer, a longitudinal bias of the free ferromagnetic layer, and an anisotropic exchange coupling magnetic field which is generated at the interface between the ferromagnetic layer 103 and the antiferromagnetic layer 104.</p>

      A composite layer S including a free ferromagnetic layer 101, a nonmagnetic interlayer 102, a pinned ferromagnetic layer 103 and an antiferromagnetic layer 104 is interposed between ferromagnetic layers 108 composed of, for example, Ni--Fe.
      <br/>
      An antiferromagnetic layer 109 and an electrode layer 100 are deposited on each ferromagnetic layer 108.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      Unidirectional anisotropy of the antiferromagnetic layer 109 puts the ferromagnetic layer 108 into a single domain.

      Thus, a magnetic flux is applied to the free ferromagnetic layer 101 from the extension 108a of the ferromagnetic layer 108 being in contact with the composite layer S, and a longitudinal bias is applied to the free ferromagnetic layer 101 by magnetic exchange coupling.

      The output leads 117 and 119 are connected to external output leads 117b and 119b, respectively, with output terminals 117a and 119a, respectively, therebetween.
      <br/>
      Both ends of the output lead 118 are connected to the terminal 112a of the first MI element 112 and the terminal 113a of the second MI element 113.
      <br/>
      The output lead 118 is also connected to an external output lead 118b with an output terminal 118 therebetween.

      In addition, both ends 112a and 113a of the first and second MI elements 112 and 113, respectively, are connected to leads (not shown in the drawing) for applying an alternating current.

    <p num="178">
      The operation of the azimuth sensor is as follows.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 17, an alternating current of a MHz band is applied to the first and second MI elements 112 and 113 through leads not shown in the drawing.
      <br/>
      A voltage by the impedance inherent in the element is generated between both ends 112a or 113a of each of the first and second MI elements 112 and 113.
      <br/>
      When a magnetic flux by an external magnetic field having a given vector is applied to the first MI element 112, the impedance between both ends 112a of the first MI element 112 corresponds to a component of the magnetic flux parallel to the longitudinal direction of the first MI element 112 (an X-axis component).
      <br/>
      Similarly, when the magnetic flux is applied to the second MI element 113, the impedance between both ends 113a of the second MI element 113 corresponds to a component of the magnetic flux parallel to the longitudinal direction of the second MI element 113 (a Y-axis component).
      <br/>
      Thus, when the vector of the magnetic flux by the external magnetic field changes to the first and second MI elements 112 and 113, the impedances of the first and second MI elements 112 and 113 change and thus the output voltages from the first and second MI elements 112 and 113 change.
    </p>
    <p num="179">
      Accordingly, the azimuth sensor 111 generates an output current corresponding to the output voltage in response to the X-axis component of the geomagnetism through the output terminals 117a and 118a and an output current corresponding to the output voltage in response to the Y-axis component of the geomagnetism through the output terminals 119a and 118a.
      <br/>
      These output currents are fed into a processing section not shown in the drawing through the external output leads 117b, 118b and 119b.
      <br/>
      The processing section determines the direction of the magnetic flux by the geomagnetism based on the output currents.

    <p num="180">
      The MI element in accordance with the present invention can detect a magnetism of approximately 10-5 Oe, whereas conventional MR elements have a sensitivity of approximately 0.1 Oe. When an alternating current of several to several tens MHz is applied to the first and second MI elements 112 and 113 which are connected to a self-oscillator such as a Colpitts oscillator, the sensor can detect a very weak external magnetic field with a resolution of approximately 10-6.
      <br/>
      Since the sensitivity for the magnetic detection is satisfactorily high even when the impedance of the first and second MI elements 112 and 113 are reduced by their length reduction, the azimuth sensor 111 can be miniaturized.

    <p num="181">
      As described above, the azimuth sensor 111 has coils 115 and 116 for applying a biasing magnetization to the first and second MI elements 112 and 113.

      These MI elements show a change in the output voltage or impedance with the absolute value and an external magnetic field, and the change is symmetrical with respect to an external magnetic field of zero.
    </p>
    <p num="182">
      When a biasing magnetization is not applied to the first and second MI elements 112 and 113, as shown in FIG. 18B, the output voltage from the first MI element 112 decreases as the direction of the magnetic flux by the external magnetic field is changed from 0 (degree)  to 90 (degree)  to the longitudinal direction of the first MI element 112.
      <br/>
      The output voltage from the first MI element 112 increases as the direction of the magnetic flux by the external magnetic field is changed from 90 (degree)  to 180 (degree) . Since the output voltages for 0 (degree)  and 180 (degree) 0 are the same, the direction of the magnetic flux cannot be exactly determined.
    </p>
    <p num="183">In contrast, when a biasing magnetization is applied to the first and second MI elements 112 and 113, as shown in FIG. 18C, the impedance linearly changes within a range of the direction in the external magnetic field from 0 (degree)  to 180 (degree) . Thus, the direction of the external magnetic field can be exactly determined.</p>
    <p num="184">
      It is preferable that the absolute value of the biasing magnetization applied to the first and second MI elements 112 and 113 lies in a range of 0.1 to 2 Oe. For a biasing magnetization out of the range, the impedance does not show a linear change with the external magnetic field.
      <br/>
      As a result, a direct biasing current of several mA is applied to the coils 115 and 116 for applying the biasing magnetization.

      The resulting elements have a thickness and a size which are ten times larger than those of conventional amorphous alloys.

      The soft magnetic glassy alloy in accordance with the present invention has soft magnetism at room temperatures and these characteristics are further improved by heat treatment as described above.

      The first and second MI elements 112 and 113 have a moderate change in the output voltage within a very weak external magnetic field of -2 Oe to +2 Oe.

      <br/>
      Further, a circuit having a simplified configuration can process the output voltage, resulting in production cost reduction of the azimuth sensor 111.

      Further, a circuit having a simplified configuration can process the output voltage, resulting in production cost reduction of the autocanceler 121.
      <br/>
      Since the biasing magnetization is small, that is, at most 2 Oe, a circuit for applying a biasing magnetization has a simple configuration.
