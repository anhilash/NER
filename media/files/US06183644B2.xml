      Dissolved selenium is removed from contaminated water by treating the water in a reactor containing selected endemic and other selenium reducing organisms.
      <br/>
      Microbes may be isolated from the specific water or imported from other selenium contaminated water, The microbes are then screened for ability to reduce selenium under the site specific environmental conditions.
      <br/>
      The selected microbes are optimized for selenium reduction, then established in a high density biofilm within a reactor.
      <br/>
      The selenium contaminated water is passed through the reactor with optimized nutrient mix added as needed.
      <br/>
      The elemental selenium is precipitated and removed from the water.

      The Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This invention relates to a method for removal of selenium from water.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to the use of microbes for use in removal of selenium from water at a particular location containing selenium contamination.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Technical Background</p>
    <p num="5">
      Selenium is the thirtieth (30th) most abundant element.
      <br/>
      Selenium is a naturally occurring metalloid element having atomic number 34 and an atomic weight of 78.96. It lies between sulfur and tellurium in Group 16 and between arsenic and bromine in Period 4 of the periodic table of elements.
      <br/>
      Selenium is widely dispersed in igneous rock.
      <br/>
      In hydrothermal deposits, it is associated isothermally with silver, gold, antimony, and mercury.
      <br/>
      Selenium also appears in large quantities, but in low concentrations, in sulfide and porphyry copper deposits.
      <br/>
      Moreover selenium is widely associated with various types of sedimentary rock.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Inorganic selenium is most commonly found in four oxidation states (Se6+, Se4+, Se0, and Se2-).
      <br/>
      Selenate (SeO42-) and selenite (SeO32-) are highly water soluble.
      <br/>
      Elemental selenium (Se0) is much less soluble in water.
      <br/>
      The most reduced form, hydrogen selenide (H2 Se) occurs as a toxic gas, but is readily oxidized to elemental selenium in the presence of air.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Elemental selenium can be oxidized to selenite by microorganisms or chemically oxidized in alkaline or mildly acidic conditions.
      <br/>
      Further oxidation of selenite results in the conversion to selenate.
      <br/>
      In highly oxidizing environments, such as well-aerated surface waters, especially those with alkaline conditions, the majority of selenium is present as selenate.
      <br/>
      The relative proportions of selenite and selenate depend on water redox potentials and pH.
      <br/>
      Selenite is reduced to elemental selenium under mildly reducing conditions while selenate reduction occurs under stronger reducing conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Selenium forms covalent compounds with most other substances and is necessary in small amounts for most forms of life.
      <br/>
      Selenium is a chemical analog of sulfur and can interfere with normal cellular metabolism.
      <br/>
      Selenium is a teratogen in mammals and birds, contributing to birth defects in several species.
      <br/>
      Data related to selenium poisoning has been extensively published over the last decade.
      <br/>
      Selenium has been reported to cause death and/or mutations in fish and waterfowl.
      <br/>
      A highly publicized case of selenium poisoning occurred in California's Kesterson Wildlife Reservoir, resulting in its closure.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Selenium is a common water contaminant throughout the United States and the world and represents a major environmental problem in at least nine western states.
      <br/>
      Selenium contamination originates from many sources including mining operations, mineral processing, abandoned mine sites, petroleum processing, and agricultural run-off.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The principal sources of selenium contamination in mining are copper and uranium bearing ores and sulfur deposits.
      <br/>
      Selenium is commonly found in these mining wastewaters in concentrations ranging from a few micrograms per liter up to more than 12 mg/L.
      <br/>
      In precious metals operations, waste and process water and heap leachate solutions selenium may be present at concentrations up to 30 mg/L.
      <br/>
      While most of these mining operations are currently zero-discharge facilities, eventual treatment will be necessary to remove selenium to meet discharge and closure requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Additionally, in many areas in the Western United States, natural background selenium concentration in irrigation drainwater and streams may exceed 2.0  MU g/L. Selenium in irrigation drainwater has been a concern for the past two decades because of its adverse effect on aquatic life and waterfowl.</p>
    <p num="12">
      The National Primary Drinking Water Standard maximum containment level (MCL) for selenium is 50  MU g/L and the maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) is 50  MU g/L.
      <br/>
      The current EPA National Ambient Water Quality Criteria, adopted as standards by most Western States for protection of aquatic life is 5.0  MU g/L (chronic) and 20.0  MU g/L (acute).
      <br/>
      However the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has suggested that these standards are inadequate, particularly with regard to protection of fish, waterfowl, and endangered aquatic species.
      <br/>
      Questioning of these standards has arisen because some laboratory and field studies indicate that water borne selenium concentrations as low as 2.0  MU g/L may bio-accumulate in complex aquatic food chains to toxic levels.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Removal of selenium from large volume waters to meet discharge criteria is one of the nation's more complex environmental problems.
      <br/>
      Several methods have been investigated for treating agricultural wastewaters.
      <br/>
      These treatments generally involve the reduction of SeO4-2 to elemental selenium using either chemical reduction with ferrous hydroxide �Fe(OH)2 � or biological reduction using an indigenous bacteria.
      <br/>
      The chemical reduction method requires operating conditions that can be difficult to obtain in large treatment operations such as a pH of about 9 and a large excess of Fe(OH)2. This method has proved to be too costly to sustain on a large scale.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Other treatment processes, such as lime precipitation, chemical reduction, activated alumina adsorption, ion exchange, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, or distillation have been demonstrated to remove a variety of pollutants including selenium from water to below drinking water standards.
      <br/>
      However, these methods are generally expensive and cost prohibitive for the treatment of large volumes of water.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Moreover, lime precipitation and chemical reduction processes can result in a mixed metal waste product that can increase treatment and disposal costs, and generally require some pH adjustment of the influent.
      <br/>
      Additionally, laboratory tests and pilot plant studies have shown that chemical precipitation employing alum, lime, ferrous sulfate or ferric sulfate are substantially ineffective for removing selenium in the selenate oxidation state.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      A process for the removal of selenium from waters using a reactor containing microbial biomass has been investigated.
      <br/>
      However, this method is inadequate because it is intended to treat water that contains at least 0.5 mg/L of selenium and is only capable of lowering the selenium concentration to 10% of the original value.
      <br/>
      In order to achieve the drinking water standard, a polishing step such as ion exchange is needed.
      <br/>
      Additionally, this method is inhibited by anions such as nitrate and sulfate.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Generally, selenium containing waters greatly differ from each other in type of selenium contamination, levels of selenium, types of co-contaminants, levels of co-contaminants, pH, ionic content, etc.
      <br/>
      These factors make the bioremediation of selenium containing waters complex and some what site-specific.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      From the foregoing it will be appreciated that it would be a significant advancement in the art to provide a low-cost method of removal of selenium contamination from water.
      <br/>
      It would be a further advancement to provide a method that would remove selenium contamination to below the MCL.
      <br/>
      It would be an additional advancement to provide a method that would economically remove selenium concentrations to below drinking water standards.
      <br/>
      It would be an further advancement in the art to provide a method that could remove both selenate and selenite.
      <br/>
      It would be a further advancement to provide a method that could remove selenium in concentrations ranging from below 0.5 mg/L to greater than 100 mg/L.
      <br/>
      It would be a further advancement to provide a method of bioremediation that could remove selenium from widely varying waters.
      <br/>
      It would be a further advancement in the art to provide a method of bioremediation that could remove selenium from widely varying waters using retention times ranging from 4+.24 hours.

    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="20">
      The present invention provides a method for reducing oxidized selenium and removing the selenium contamination from water.
      <br/>
      The method is not limited to a specific type of wastewater and can be used with industrial, mining, and agricultural waters.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the method may be used to optimize selenium removal at any given site.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      One step of the method of the present invention is to isolate endemic microbes from the selenium contaminated water.
      <br/>
      These microbes are then screened along with other known selenium reducers for their ability to reduce selenium under site-specific conditions.
      <br/>
      The microbes are also screened for their potential to interfere with selenium reduction.
      <br/>
      The endemic and other selenium reducing microbes may include Pseudomonas species, Alcalaqines species, E. coli, and sulfate reducing bacteria.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Cultures of selenium reducing microorganisms are selected and optimized for selenium reduction and growth in a bioreactor or in some cases, in situ application.
      <br/>
      The optimized cultures are selected on contaminant reduction parameters and required nutrient amendments.
      <br/>
      A high-density biofilm of the selected organisms is established within the reactor or in situ environment.
      <br/>
      The reactor may be a single chamber bioreactor or have a series of reactors connected together.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As the organisms grow within the reactor a nutrient mix can be supplied to maintain optimal selenium reduction.
      <br/>
      In one presently preferred embodiment, the nutrients may include mixes of sugars, whey, waste food products, protein mixtures, yeast extract, phosphate and other vitamins and minerals.
      <br/>
      Under certain environmental conditions the selenium reduction may be optimized with sugar mixtures or waste food products and other vitamins and minerals at concentrations ranging from 0.25 g/L to 5.0 g/L and a phosphate concentration of about 50 mg/L.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The selenium contaminated water passes through the reactor along with the nutrient mix.
      <br/>
      The water is retained in the reactor for a period of about 4 hours to about 24 hours.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments the retention period may be short, for example from about 4 to about 8 hours.
      <br/>
      In certain other embodiments the retention period is from about 12 to about 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The method of the present invention is capable of reducing both selenate and selenite to elemental selenium.
      <br/>
      As the elemental selenium forms it precipitates from the solution.
      <br/>
      The precipitate may be removed in a variety of solid/liquid separation methods such as flushing, back flushing, agitation, separation in a hydrocyclone, and tangential filtration.
      <br/>
      Elemental selenium is a valuable substance and may be sold on the open market, thus recovering some of the costs of the removal process.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The reactor or reactors contain a matrix for establishing a biofilm thereon.
      <br/>
      Various materials may support the biofilm including gravel, charcoal, pumice, continuous-release microbe-containing agar based beads, a mixture of bio-solids, carbon/agar-based matrices, and combination thereof.
      <br/>
      Other types of biofilm establishment are within the knowledge of those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      A method for screening microbes for selenium reduction is also presented.
      <br/>
      Microbes are first isolated from a selenium-contaminated environment.
      <br/>
      The isolated microbes are characterized according to colony morphology, gram stain, and metabolic profiles.
      <br/>
      Microbes are then incubated in a nutrient selected solution containing selenium.
      <br/>
      The solution is then in turn analyzed for selenium reduction.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Microbes for use at a specific site once selected based on endemic and other selenium reducing microbes, endemic non-selenium reducing microbes, growth and selenium reduction in site waters, and utilization of economical nutrient mixtures.</p>

      <br/>
      Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the method of the present invention, as represented in FIGS. 1 through 9, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention.
      <br/>

      The illustrations are merely representative of certain, embodiments of the invention.
      <br/>
      Those embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Those of ordinary skill in the art will, of course, appreciate that various modifications to the details of the Figures may easily be made without departing from the essential characteristics of the invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, the following description of the Figures is intended only as an example, and simply illustrates embodiments that one consistent with the invention as claimed.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      A process for removing selenium from aqueous streams including industrial process wastewater and agricultural runoff is described.
      <br/>
      Laboratory and field testing of numerous process solutions containing from less than 0.05 to 33.0 mg/L selenium has produced effluents to meet drinking water criteria and field discharge criteria.
      <br/>
      The technology uses enhanced site-specific custom microbial cultures combined with selected indigenous selenium-reducing bacteria to economically remove selenium.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The processes of this invention make it economically feasible to significantly reduce the selenium level in industrial process and wastewaters, agricultural waters, and other drinking waters.
      <br/>
      The process can be configured to operate in anaerobic or micro-aerophilic conditions under either of two regimes: (1) a process configured to remove up to 97% of selenium from waters/solutions containing high levels of selenium using low (4 to 8 hr) retention times; and (2) a process configured to remove selenium to drinking water criteria using longer (12 to 24 hr) retention times.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The invention uses enhanced site-specific custom microbial cultures and indigenous selenium-reducing bacteria, to economically remove selenium.
      <br/>
      The process will operate in anaerobic or micro-aerophilic conditions.
      <br/>
      Key features of the reactor system are: (1) screening indigenous and other selected microbes for selenium reduction under expected environmental conditions; (2) establishment of the selected microbial population, based on metabolic profiles, as a high density biofilm on reactor media; (3) operation of the reactor using dissolved oxygen levels, redox conditions, and solution retention times as determined in the screening tests; and (4) using a separate nutrient feed stream based on metabolic profiles and selenium reduction tests. for each staged reactor.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      A site-specific optimization is an essential component of bioprocess development in order to achieve economical removal efficiencies at realistic retention times and operating costs.
      <br/>
      The end results of this bioprocess optimization is the development of a site-specific microbial cocktail, confirmed to efficiently and economically remove selenium to below site target criteria using actual site waters using retention times of about 4 to 24 hours.
      <br/>
      This optimized microbial cocktail consists of site-endemic, and other naturally occurring, non-pathogenic microbes, including previously tested Pseudomonas species.
      <br/>
      MIDI fatty acid profiles were generated for all selected microbes in order to track the population through bioprocess implementation.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Overall, nutrient costs are a primary contributor to the long-term operating costs of any heterotrophic bioprocess.
      <br/>
      Nutrient costs can be reduced with through careful microorganism selection, nutrient optimization, and attention to bioreactor microbial density.
      <br/>
      The result of this biotreatability testing indicates that efficient selenium reduction can be obtained with an inexpensive molasses based nutrient.
      <br/>
      As determined in laboratory and field tests, estimated operating cost for a sugar-based or waste food products-based nutrients biological selenium reduction process are anticipated to be as low as $0.35-$0.50/1000 gallons.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Referring to FIG. 1, a simplified schematic representation of a two-stage anaerobic bioreactor system 10 that would have a retention time of 18 to 24 hours is presented.
      <br/>
      Laboratory and field-testing of numerous process solutions containing from less than 0.05 to 33.0 mg/L selenium has produced effluents to meet drinking water criteria (10  MU g/L).
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Because selenium contaminated waters are complex and differ significantly in selenium concentration and other environmental factors, a microbial screening 12 step allows the method to be employed with any selenium-contaminated water.
      <br/>
      At this step microbes are screened allowing for the selection and establishment of the optimal microbial mix to perform the selenium conversion and subsequent removal from the water.
      <br/>
      Microbes are further screened in order to minimize anion interferences such as nitrate and sulfate, and maximize selenium removal kinetics.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Initially, site water is screened for endemic selenium-reducing microbial cultures, and non-selenium reducers, which could possibly interfere with selenium reduction.
      <br/>
      Other non-endemic microbes are also screened for their ability to reduce selenium under environmental conditions.
      <br/>
      Cultures are selected on their ability to reduce selenium under environmental conditions, their metabolic profiles that will minimize nutrient costs, and to minimize over growth by endemic non-selenium reducers.
      <br/>
      Selected cultures are optimized for selenium reduction through determination of selenium reduction parameters and required nutrient amendments.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      After initial screening/optimization, the desired microbial population is established as a stabilized biofilm on the reactor media within the reactors 18, 22.
      <br/>
      Selenium containing water is passed through the bioreactor 30 containing a select population of suspended and immobilized biofilm microorganisms.
      <br/>
      Nutrient feed 16 is supplied at each of the reactors 18, 22.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments of the invention, the nutrient feed 16 includes nutrient bases composed of agricultural grade sugars and/or waste food products or protein mixes supplied at a concentration of about 2.0 g/L and supplemented with appropriate vitamins and minerals.
      <br/>
      The nutrient feed 16 may also contain yeast extract and/or phosphate may at a concentration of about 50 mg/L.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The reactors 18, 22 contain a matrix suitable for sustaining high concentrations of microbes.
      <br/>
      The matrix may include such materials as gravel, charcoal, continuous-release microbe-containing agar beads, and a mixture of bio-solids, and carbon/agar, or other porous materials.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      As the microbes reduce the selenite and selenate, insoluble elemental selenium precipitates.
      <br/>
      The elemental selenium may either be retained within the reactor or removed by a solid/liquid separation, flocculation/settling, filtration, step 24 such as flushing, tangential (cross-flow) filtration, and hydrocyclone.
      <br/>
      The specific particulate selenium removal step depends on the water chemistry and the microbes selected for selenium reduction.
      <br/>
      The resulting effluent 26 contains levels of selenium reduced to below drinking water criteria or other desired discharge criteria.

    <p num="53">
      Over 48 heterotrophic microorganisms were isolated from nine separate representative site samples.
      <br/>
      Eighteen of these microbes were capable of reducing selenium in laboratory prepared selenium solutions used to select and screen selenium-reducing microbes.
      <br/>
      In addition, several previously collected selenium-reducing Pseudomonas species, and other species and strains were selected based on their original source of isolation (high selenium containing mining and industrial process waters) and their ability to perform a reduction on other oxyanionic contaminants.
      <br/>
      All isolates tested are naturally occurring, non-pathogenic facultative anaerobes.
      <br/>
      Isolates that reduced selenium to below 95% in this screening, were subsequently tested in site waters containing .about.2.0 mg/L selenium for their ability to reduce selenium.
      <br/>
      Tests were conducted in 15 ml tubes under static conditions at ambient temperature for seven days.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 3, results of this screening demonstrate the effect that site waters have on selenium reduction.
    </p>
    <p num="54">Microbes were characterized through plating samples, noting colony morphology, gram stains, metabolic profile analysis, followed by testing selected microbes for their ability to reduce selenium in various economical nutrients.</p>
    <p num="55">
      Microbes were grown for 24 hr in 50 ml culture tubes containing TSB at ambient temperature followed by subsequent dilution or concentration to an OD of 0.800 (cell density of 8.0 * 108 /ml greater than 2.0 * 108 /ml.
      <br/>
      The cells were washed with saline, resuspended in site waters with selected nutrients, and incubated at ambient temperature for six days.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows the effectiveness of selected nutrients for selenium reduction in site water.
      <br/>
      In the site waters tested for this example, molasses and molasses-based nutrients were shown to be most effective for selenium reduction by site and other selected microbes.
      <br/>
      A molasses-based nutrient at about 1.0 g/L with yeast at about 0.25 mg/L were shown to be the most economical combination with good selenium reduction.
      <br/>
      Top performing microbes from this screening were selected for bioreactor testing.
    </p>
    <p num="56">Example 4--Bioreactor/Bioprocess Tests</p>
    <p num="57">
      Microbial support materials evaluated for selenium-reduction at the site included gravel, coconut charcoal screened to +8 mesh, and continuous-release microbe containing agar-based beads.
      <br/>
      Controls were used to determine possible sorption of dissolved selenium to materials used in the proposed testing.
      <br/>
      Sorption tests were conducted with biofilm support materials (50% by volume to approximate reactor conditions) under static conditions at ambient temperature for 2,4, and 8 hr.
      <br/>
      Tests used pre-wetted biofilm support materials, 25-100 ml of actual process water.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Two sets of anaerobic up-flow bioreactors were used to evaluate preliminary biological selenium reduction operating parameters and economics, retention time, flow rate, system kinetics, nutrients, and overall system performance.
      <br/>
      All tests were conducted in one-inch diameter columns operated in single-pass, up-flow mode with retention times ranging from 6 to 24 hr, at ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      The bioreactors used a defined microbial cocktail of Pseudomonas and other site bacteria to provide scale-up estimates for pilot-scale application.
      <br/>
      Controls used carbon, slag, agar-based beads, biosolids and other biofilm support materials without microorganisms.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Reactors tested used agar-based beads configured to evaluate microbial cocktail compositions in the following process (SeO42-) --&gt; (Se0), gravel, and activated carbon.
      <br/>
      Gravel and carbon reactors were treated to enhance biofilm establishment and then inoculated with the top performing microorganisms, FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      Reactors were inoculated in a manner to ensure establishment of this microbial cocktail as the predominant microorganisms in the reactors.
      <br/>
      After a brief conditioning time, the carbon and agar-based bead reactors were removing selenium to well below target levels; reaching low microgram to non-detectable levels.
      <br/>
      Some low-level microgram selenium spikes were observed that were probably due to elemental selenium migrating through the reactors.
      <br/>
      Since the reactor effluent collection vessels were open to the atmosphere, the elemental selenium was dissolving before the filtration step conducted every 24 hrs.
      <br/>
      Keeping the effluent collection flasks in an anaerobic environment will most likely prevent these low-level spikes.
      <br/>
      Control reactors consisted of agar-based beads, gravel, and carbon without microorganisms.
    </p>
    <p num="60">Example 5--Determination of Optimal Microbe and Nutrients</p>
    <p num="61">
      Referring to FIG. 6, a comparison of selenium removal by different microbes, nutrients, and aeration levels in mine water containing 0.62 mg/L selenium at pH 7.96 is presented.
      <br/>
      Tests used 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of filter sterilized wastewater and a 10-fold dilution of log phase microbial cells (2.0 * 108 cells/ml) as an inoculum.
      <br/>
      Optimum aeration levels depend on the microorganism, mining water, and nutrient supplement.
      <br/>
      Under conditions of aeration (shaker flasks- 125 rpm) peptone-glycerol-yeast (PGY) and peptone supplements with P. stutzeri and A. xylosoxydans resulted in significantly lower selenium levels than did ammonium sulfate and dextrose supplements.
      <br/>
      However, when oxygen levels were low (static flasks), the ammonium sulfate and dextrose supplement performed best.
      <br/>
      Selenium reductions to  &lt;= 0.02 mg/L were achieved with P. stutzeri and A. xylosoxydans.
      <br/>
      The microbial consortium, containing A. xylosoxydans, produced less dramatic results.
      <br/>
      Additional quantitative assessments of selenate and selenite reduction by P. stutzeri and other isolates were performed in peptone based media containing 10.0 mg/L selenium and incubated at 24 (degree)  C. with shaking at 125 rpm.
      <br/>
      Stoichiometric reductions of selenate and selenite were observed during late log and early stationary phases of cell growth.
    </p>
    <p num="62">Example 6--Inhibition of Selenium Reduction by Certain Anions</p>
    <p num="63">
      Microbes were screened in a peptone medium (pH 7.6) to investigate inhibition of selenium reduction by nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, and sulfite.
      <br/>
      The results of this screening are shown in Table 1.
      <br/>
      Data for two microorganisms are presented.
      <br/>
      Various microorganisms were incubated in triplicate on a rotary shaker (125-rpm) at 25 (degree)  C. in flasks containing initial selenium concentrations of 50 mg/L.
      <br/>
      Selenate and selenite reduction by various microbes was inhibited to different degrees by the anions.
      <br/>
      It was observed that anion inhibition of P. stutzeri selenate or selenite reduction was microorganism and microbial isolate dependent; only slight inhibition was observed with some isolates.

    <p num="65">Example 7--Comparison of Selenium Reduction by Microbes on Two Mine Waters</p>
    <p num="66">
      Referring to FIG. 7, the data obtained from studies comparing selenium reduction in the presence of mine waters 1 and 2, containing 1.48 and 6.2 mg/L selenate, respectively, different carbon sources, and microorganisms are presented. A. xylosoxydans and the microbial consortium were indigenous to mining water 2, while P. stutzeri was not indigenous to either mining water.
      <br/>
      None of the organisms were indigenous to mining water 1.
      <br/>
      Cell growth and numbers were approximately equal when added to the different carbon sources and mine water 1 at pH 7.9 and mine water 2 at pH 9.2. All microbes were used from cultures in log phase and microbial concentrations were at 2 * 108 or greater after dilution.
      <br/>
      Three replicate samples were tested, without aeration, at 24 (degree)  C., for 24 and 36 hr with the listed carbon source and additives.
      <br/>
      Selenium reduction by a particular microbe or consortia of microorganisms has distinct optimum and of ten different nutrient requirements.

    <p num="67">Example 8--Selenium Reduction</p>
    <p num="68">
      Referring to FIG. 8, selenium reduction by the microorganisms used in FIGS. 6 and 7 is illustrated.
      <br/>
      Dextrose and ammonium sulfate (1 g/L each) nutrients were added to mine water 1.
      <br/>
      All microbes were used from cultures in log phase and microbial concentrations were approximately 2 * 108 or greater after dilution.
      <br/>
      In cultures started with a 10-fold dilution of cells in late log phase, the reduction to elemental selenium was complete within 6 to 18 hr.
      <br/>
      Generally, with higher cell dilutions of 50 or 100 fold, reduction to elemental selenium required 24-36 hr and 36 to 72 hr, respectively.

    <p num="69">Example 9--Bioreactor System to Treat to Below Drinking Water Criteria</p>
    <p num="70">
      Referring to FIG. 2, a bioreactor system was configured to remove selenium from various waters to below drinking water criteria (0.01 mg/l).
      <br/>
      Enhanced biofilms of P. stutzeri have been developed on surfaces by pretreatment of the support material with selected biopolymers.
      <br/>
      Biofilms established in such a manner have supported single microbes and microbial consortia for selenium reduction for periods up to nine months using enhanced/immobilized biofilms of P. stutzeri using a mine water containing 0.62 mg/L selenium as selenate.
      <br/>
      Tests used a single-pass bioreactor with a retention time of 18 hr.
      <br/>
      The enhanced biofilm preparation removed selenium to below 0.01 mg/L for nine months without the addition of supplemental nutrients.
    </p>
    <p num="71">Example 10--Bioreactor for Treating High Levels of Selenium with a Short Retention Time</p>
    <p num="72">
      A bioreactor system was configured to treat waters containing high levels of selenium using short retention times.
      <br/>
      A bench-scale study was conducted in which an E. coli isolate was used to treat a smelter, weak acid effluent containing more than 33 mg/L selenium.
      <br/>
      A rotating biological contractor (RBC) with a 9.2 m2 disk surface and 30-L capacity was used as the bioreactor.
      <br/>
      Initial test results indicated the 97% of the selenium was removed from the contaminated solution with a 4-hr retention time.
      <br/>
      Tests on other mining process waters using a bench scale RBC, P. stutzeri, a molasses-based nutrient (1.0 g/L), and a 6 hr retention time removed 97% of the selenium.
    </p>
    <p num="73">Example 11--Precipitate Analysis</p>
    <p num="74">
      Referring to FIG. 9, the precipitate from the bioreactor is analyzed using a spectrometer.
      <br/>
      Depending on the mining water used and the oxygen content of the water, either red amorphous or dark brown to black crystalline selenium precipitates are formed.
      <br/>
      However, the dark brown to black crystalline selenium precipitates only have been noticed in systems with low dissolved oxygen and low redox readings.
      <br/>
      Preliminary SEM analysis of the selenium precipitates produced in reactors specifically configured for selenium reduction indicate a relatively pure selenium byproduct.
      <br/>
      SEM scans similar to FIG. 9 were obtained from immobilized live of P. pseudoalcaligenes and P. stutzeri used to treat complex mining waters containing uranium, copper, arsenic, and other metals.
      <br/>
      Selenium was the predominant metal/metalloid detected.
      <br/>
      Silicon is from the glass slide mount, and gold was deposited on the sample through the sputter-coating process.
      <br/>
      Calcium present in the sample is from the immobilization polymer.
      <br/>
      This preliminary data indicates the selectivity of these microbes and other naturally occurring microbes for selenium reduction in complex waters.
      <br/>
      Recovery of a high-purity selenium product from wastewaters could partially offset treatment costs.
