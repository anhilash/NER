      The invention relates to the use of oil-soluble oleophilic organic liquid phases-flowable at temperatures of 0 to 10° C.-from the classes of corresponding monocarboxylic and/or polycarboxylic acid esters, carbonic acid esters, fatty alcohols and their oligoalkoxides and/or ethers as the at least predominant part of the liquid phase in storage-stable homogeneous mixtures with guar and/or water-soluble guar derivatives for their use in water-based borehole servicing fluids.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In the field of polymeric carbohydrate compounds based on natural materials, guar and its derivatives, such as hydroxyalkyl guar and/or carboxyalkyl guar, are of considerable importance for many industrial applications.
      <br/>
      The guar-based swelling agents normally used in the form of more or less fine powders are distinguished by their extremely effective thickening when dissolved in aqueous phases.
      <br/>
      There are reliable methods for controlling the viscosity of correspondingly thickened aqueous treatment solutions using both selected products based on guar or its derivatives and, in particular, suitable crosslinking agents which enable viscosity in the aqueous phase to be additionally controlled through nonionic, anionic and/or cationic mechanisms.
      <br/>
      The technical questions involved here are discussed in numerous prior art publications, cf. for example Davidson, Handbook of Water-Soluble Gums and Resins, Chapter 6, McGraw-Hill, London (1980).

      It is known that the class of useful materials of natural origin in question here is characterized by carbohydrate polymer compounds which are made up at least by far predominantly of mannose and galactose units.
      <br/>
      The primary hydroxyl group in the C6 position is particularly suitable for derivatization, although secondary hydroxyl groups of the polymer skeleton may also be derivatized.
      <br/>
      The rheological and other properties of the water-based treatment liquids ultimately required can be controlled very precisely by optional purification of the natural basic material and/or by derivatization in the sense discussed above and optionally by using crosslinking agents.

      So far as industrial-scale operation is concerned, difficulties can lie in the early phase of the interaction between the dry guar-based powder and the aqueous phase.
      <br/>
      An overly rapid interaction between the dry powder and the aqueous phase which is kept in particular at low temperatures results in the formation of solid particles which form gel-like lumps and of which the gel shell prevents further penetration of the aqueous phase into the interior of the lump and is thus a serious obstacle to uniform dissolution and dispersion of the solid material in the aqueous phase.
      <br/>
      Difficulties of this nature arise in particular when, on an industrial scale, considerable quantities of correspondingly thickened aqueous treatment liquids have to be produced in situ and delivered directly to the point of use.
      <br/>
      A typical example of this is the use of guar-thickened treatment solutions in the on-shore and/or off-shore development of natural useful materials, such as petroleum, natural gas, water and the like.
      <br/>
      Aqueous polymer systems are often used in the servicing of boreholes (for example cleaning, periodic stimulation and the like).
      <br/>
      Polymers capable of establishing high and predetermined viscosities are particularly useful for this purpose.
      <br/>
      Guar and guar derivatives or mixtures thereof with other auxiliaries, particularly crosslinking agents are prominent in this regard.
      <br/>
      In chapter 6-10, for example, the literature reference cited above describes the use of correspondingly thickened water-based frac fluids for restoring or increasing the production capacity of corresponding wells.
      <br/>
      The frac fluid system generally involves the use of so-called proppants (in by far the majority of cases sand), the function of the frac fluids pumped into the borehole from below being on the one hand to penetrate into the area around the well bearing useful material and, on the other hand, to introduce the entrained proppants into the new channels opened up in order further to enhance their effect.

      For the use of guar or guar derivatives as a thickener and viscosity generator in water-based treatment liquids for servicing boreholes, a particular form of presentation has been developed for the powders based on guar or guar derivatives which meets the various requirements of this particular application particularly well.
      <br/>
      The guar-based dry powders are mixed with substantially equal quantities of water-insoluble, liquid hydrocarbon compounds to form a high-solids, but flowable or pumpable dispersion.
      <br/>
      Hitherto, diesel oils or at least substantially dearomaticized hydrocarbon fractions of equally low viscosity have hitherto been used as the organic liquid phase.
      <br/>
      This pumpable concentrate may be continuously mixed in during introduction of the water-based treatment fluid into the borehole.
      <br/>
      The guar-based fine-particle useful materials swell after a certain time.
      <br/>
      This ensures that the fine-particle swelling solid is uniformly incorporated in the entire aqueous phase.
      <br/>
      The occurrence of undesirably rapid surface swelling and hence interference with swelling through the system are also eliminated.

    <p num="7">
      The teaching according to the invention starts out from this particular preparation of guar and guar derivatives for the production of water-based treatment solutions of controllable viscosity.
      <br/>
      The problem addressed by the teaching according to the invention was to improve this principle in several respects.
      <br/>
      Liquid hydrocarbon compounds of the type hitherto used for the purpose in question are potential pollutants with only limited degradability, particularly in the off-shore sector.
      <br/>
      Quite apart from this, however, technical effects are also in need of improvement.
      <br/>
      The known highly concentrated mixtures of powder-form guar or corresponding guar derivatives and pure liquid hydrocarbon compounds under discussion here show only limited dispersion stability.
      <br/>
      After storage for several hours with no movement of the multicomponent mixture, the guar solids sink to the bottom of the storage container with simultaneous phase separation into a predominant solid phase and a supernatant liquid phase.
      <br/>
      Resulting errors in the metering of predetermined quantities of the solid phase into the water-based servicing fluid endanger the process as a whole.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the guar dispersions used hitherto require the use of stabilizers and/or thickeners in the oleophilic liquid phase.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The teaching according to the invention as described hereinafter is based on the discovery that substantial improvements and simplifications in many respects can be achieved by replacing the at least predominant part of the organic hydrocarbon-based liquid phase with selected hydrocarbon oils derivatized with polar groups.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      In a first embodiment, therefore, the present invention relates to the use of oil-soluble oleophilic organic liquid phases--flowable at temperatures of 0 to 10 (degree)  C.--from the classes of corresponding monocarboxylic and/or polycarboxylic acid esters, carbonic acid esters, ethers, fatty alcohols and their oligoalkoxides and mixtures thereof with one another as the at least predominant part of the liquid phase in storage-stable homogeneous mixtures with guar and/or water-soluble guar derivatives which are present as a preferably fine-particle solid phase.
      <br/>
      The oleophilic organic liquid phases used in accordance with the invention, as listed above, are additionally characterized by flashpoints of at least 80 (degree)  C. and viscosities (Brookfield RVT viscosities, as measured at 10 (degree)  C.) of at most 100 to 150 mPas.
      <br/>
      The multiphase mixtures of useful materials of the described type are suitable for use in water-based borehole servicing fluids and, by virtue of their content of guar and/or water-water-soluble guar derivatives, lead to adjustable viscosities in the aqueous liquid phase.
    </p>
    <p num="10">In another embodiment, the present invention relates to the multiple-phase mixtures of useful materials of the oleophilic organic liquid phases defined above and the solid fine-particle useful materials based on guar and/or guar derivatives incorporated therein.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      The teaching according to the invention is based on the hitherto unreported discovery that oleophilic liquid phases based on monocarboxylic and/or polycarboxylic acid esters, carbonic acid esters, fatty alcohols and their derivatives and also ethers--and in particular based on selected mixtures of the classes of compounds mentioned--meet the requirements stated at the beginning in the acknowledgement of the prior art better than the hitherto used organic liquid phases based on pure hydrocarbon compounds.
      <br/>
      The organic liquid phases selected in accordance with the invention are distinguished on the one hand by sufficiently large molecule constituents with a hydrocarbon structure.
      <br/>
      This guarantees the element of the oleophilic organic liquid phase.
      <br/>
      However, they are distinguished from the pure hydrocarbon compounds of the prior art by their contents of functional groups of increased polarity, more particularly ester groups, ether groups and/or hydroxyl groups.
      <br/>
      Correspondingly functionalized hydrocarbon oils are distinguished not only by substantially better environmental compatibility and hence in particular by improved degradability through natural degradation processes, it has also been found that the concentrated mixtures of the oil phases selected in accordance with the invention with the dry fine-particle useful materials based on guar or guar derivatives show greatly increased stability to unwanted separation processes.
      <br/>
      By mixing selected components of the oil phase, the liquid/solid concentrates described herein can be optimized in various ways.
      <br/>
      The particular functional groups in the hydrocarbon molecule of the liquid phase would appear to perform various functions in this regard.
      <br/>
      Thus, the interaction between the surface of the guar-based solid particle and the oil phase derivatized in accordance with the invention would appear to be stronger than is the case where pure hydrocarbon oils are used.
      <br/>
      The result is the increased stability of the high concentrated mixture of useful materials to separation.
      <br/>
      However, improvements in effect can also be utilized in practice in addition to and irrespective of the aspect of increased ecological compatibility.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Before the particular characteristics of the individual classes of compounds listed above for the oleophilic liquid phase as defined in accordance with the invention are discussed, preferred generally valid parameters for these liquid phases will be defined.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is preferred in accordance with the invention to use oleophilic liquid phases with flashpoints of at least 100 (degree)  C. and, more particularly, at least 130 (degree)  C. Distinctly higher flashpoints, for example of at least 150 to 180 (degree)  C., can be particularly preferred.
      <br/>
      At the same time, equally valid, preferred parameters for the viscosity behavior of the oleophilic liquid phases have to be taken into account.
      <br/>
      Preferred liquid phases for the purposes of the invention have viscosities, as measured at 10 (degree)  C., of at most about 50 mPas, viscosities of at most and, in particular, below 30 mPas being particularly important.
      <br/>
      The adequate flowability of the oil-based combination of useful materials, even at low temperatures, is a desirable quality for the use of the guar concentrates in water-based borehole servicing fluids.
      <br/>
      In off-shore drilling for example, sea water with its low temperatures is of course used as aqueous phase in the borehole servicing step of the drilling process.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The mixtures according to the invention of oleophilic liquid phase and fine-particle guar-based useful material may be formulated with high concentrations in the same way as the hitherto used mixtures with oils based on pure hydrocarbon compounds.
      <br/>
      Thus, preferred mixing ratios of oleophilic liquid phase to fine-particle solid phase are mixing ratios (parts by weight) of 65:35 to 40:60, more particularly, 55:45 to 45:55.
      <br/>
      Corresponding mixtures containing substantially equal quantities by weight of guar or guar derivative on the one hand and the oleophilic liquid phase sufficiently flowable at low temperatures on the other hand are particularly suitable.
      <br/>
      Mixtures of this type are distinguished by high stability to unwanted separation, as shown in the following Examples.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A particularly relevant parameter in the choice of particularly suitable oil phases for the purposes of the invention is the pour point or softening point of the oleophilic oil or mixed oil phase.
      <br/>
      Preferred components are those which, as such or in the form of mixtures with one another, have pour points of -5 (degree)  C. or lower and, preferably, of -10 (degree)  C. to -15 (degree)  C. or lower.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Accordingly, the oleophilic liquid phases now used in accordance with the invention in conjunction with the guar-based thickeners correspond to a prior art publication which relates generally to oil-based drilling fluids and which, in particular, describes the use of corresponding flowable oils as the continuous oil phase of w/o invert drilling muds.
      <br/>
      Among the numerous prior art publications available in the meantime, reference is made in particular to the disclosures of applicants' following patents: EP 0 386 638 (C1-5 mono-carboxylic acid esters); EP 0 386 636 (C6-11 monocarboxylic acid esters); EP 0 374 672 (saturated C12-16 monocarboxylic acids esters); EP 0 374 671 (monoolefinically and/or polyolefinically unsaturated C16-24 monocarboxylic acid esters); EP 0 382 071 (methyl esters of C6-24 monocarboxylic acids); EP 0 391 251 (water-insoluble ethers of monohydric alcohols of natural and/or synthetic origin containing at least 4 carbon atoms in the alcohol radicals); EP 0 391 252 (at least substantially water-insoluble monohydric and/or polyhydric alcohols of natural and/or synthetic origin which are flowable and pumpable at temperatures of 0 to 5 (degree)  C.); EP 0 532 570 (oleophilic diesters of carbonic acid with the same or different oil-soluble monohydric and optionally polyhydric alcohols); WO 91/19771 (oleophilic polycarboxylic acid esters).
      <br/>
      The following further observations apply in particular to the disclosures of these publications on characteristic representatives of the oleophilic liquid phase defined in accordance with the invention:
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The ethers to be used in accordance with the invention include corresponding oleophilic acetals of the type described, for example, in EP 0 512 501.
      <br/>
      The alcohols, the carboxylic acids or esters formed therefrom, the ethers including the acetals and other components of the classes of suitable compounds mentioned here may be at least partly of natural and/or of synthetic origin.
      <br/>
      Reference is made purely by way of example in this regard to the disclosure of WO 95/15364 which describes esters based on monocarboxylic acids and monohydric alcohols from the oxosynthesis.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The many prior art publications listed in the foregoing on the character of suitable oleophilic liquid phases are also relevant to the problem addressed by the present invention and the technical solution provided by the invention.
      <br/>
      Reference is made in this regard to the disclosures of these prior art publications in connection with the various classes of oleophilic liquid phases suitable for the purposes of the invention and mixtures thereof with guar and guar derivatives.
      <br/>
      These disclosures are hereby specifically included as part of the disclosure of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Other particularly suitable oil phases for the purposes of the invention are esters of monocarboxylic acids which are liquid at low temperatures, more particularly corresponding esters of monocarboxylic acids containing at least 6 to 8 carbon atoms and preferably at least 10 to 12 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Suitable alcohols are both monohydric and lower polyhydric alcohols, for example dihydric or trihydric alcohols, as stated in detail in the cited publications.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Particular significance is attributed in this connection on the one hand to esters of saturated monocarboxylic acids containing 6 to 16 carbon atoms and/or esters of monoolefinically and/or polyolefinically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids containing 16 to 30 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Corresponding esters with monohydric alcohols preferably containing up to 12 carbon atoms are a particularly preferred class of compounds.
      <br/>
      Investigations conducted by applicants have shown that ester oils and, in particular, the ester oils defined therein have a particularly pronounced stabilizing effect in the highly concentrated guar mixtures.
      <br/>
      The interaction between the ester group on the one hand and the highly hydrophilic outer surface of the guar-based solid particle on the other hand would appear to be particularly intensive.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Ester oils of the type in question may be further developed and improved in a predetermined manner by mixing with other components of the classes of compounds mentioned.
      <br/>
      Basically, this principle applies to all compounds or classes of compounds corresponding to the definition according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Mixtures of esters and ethers have proved to be particularly interesting for optimizing oleophilic liquid phases in accordance with the invention.
      <br/>
      Mixed oil phases which contain the ester oils as a major component and the ether oils as a minor component are preferred.
      <br/>
      Thus, at least two thirds of the oil phase may advantageously be formed by an ester oil.
      <br/>
      Mixing ratios of ether to ester of 3:1 to 5:1 and, more particularly, of the order of 4:1, for example, have proved to be extremely effective and optimal in many respects.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Monocarboxylic acid ester oils particularly suitable in this very connection are also described in the above-cited EP 0 386 636, EP 0 374 672 and EP 0 374 671.
      <br/>
      Particularly suitable ethers are the subject of EP 0 391 251.
      <br/>
      To complete the disclosure of the present invention, certain determining elements of these particularly suitable ethers are summarized briefly in the following:
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Water-insoluble ethers of monohydric alcohols of natural and/or synthetic origin containing at least 4 carbon atoms and preferably at least 6 carbon atoms in the alcohol radicals, which have flashpoints above 80 (degree)  C., are particularly suitable.
      <br/>
      The ethers should be flowable and pumpable at temperatures of 0 to 5 (degree)  C. and should have a Brookfield RVT viscosity at temperatures in this range of, in particular, below 50 mPas and, more particularly, at most about 30 mPas.
      <br/>
      Corresponding ethers of certain selected alcohols, more especially monohydric alcohols, are as suitable for use as the ether phase as mixed ethers and/or ether mixtures of alcohols, more especially monohydric alcohols, containing up to 24 carbon atoms which may even be at least partly olefinically unsaturated.
      <br/>
      Ethers, mixed ethers and/or ether mixtures of alcohols containing 8 to 18 carbon atoms, which may be linear and/or branched, are particularly suitable components.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As mentioned above, however, other suitable oleophilic liquid phases in the context of the teaching according to the invention--or rather mixture components for this liquid phase--are oleophilic alcohols, more particularly the oleophilic alcohols according to EP 0 391 252.
      <br/>
      These oleophilic components may be used as such and/or in the form of their at least substantially water-insoluble oligoalkoxide compounds.
      <br/>
      The monohydric and/or polyhydric alcohols preferably flowable and pumpable at temperatures of 0 to 5 (degree)  C. may be of natural and/or synthetic origin.
      <br/>
      Particularly suitable are monohydric and/or dihydric oleophilic alcohols and/or corresponding partial ethers of polyhydric, more especially dihydric, alcohols which are preferably free from aromatic molecule constituents and which are derived in particular from linear and/or branched hydrocarbon chains which may also be olefinically unsaturated.
      <br/>
      Monohydric alcohols containing at least 6 to 8 carbon atoms which, if desired, may also be at least partly olefinically unsaturated and may contain up to 36 carbon atoms are characteristic representatives.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In one modification of the teaching according to the invention, the oleophilic oils defined in accordance with the invention may also be mixed with pure hydrocarbon oils, more particularly of the type used hitherto.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, the oil phase is preferably formed at least predominantly by one or more of the oils defined in accordance with the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The known disclosures of the prior art apply to the other components of the guar-based multicomponent mixtures defined in accordance with the invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, reference is made to the literature reference cited at the beginning, Davidson, chapter 6, in connection with the character of the guar-based solid.
      <br/>
      Suitable guar derivatives are, in particular, corresponding compounds which have been formed by etherification or esterification of hydroxyl groups on the guar molecule.
      <br/>
      Commercial important derivatives are, in particular, hydroxyalkylated compounds, such as hydroxyethyl and/or hydroxypropyl guar, and carboxymethylated derivatives obtained, for example, by reaction of the starting material with monochloroacetic acid.
      <br/>
      The interaction between hydrated minerals and the guar derivative may be influenced in known manner, for example by hydroxyalkylation.
      <br/>
      Electrolyte compatibility is also distinctly improved by hydroxyalkylation of the guar.
      <br/>
      The same applies to the solubility and clarity of the aqueous guar solutions.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Information on the use of crosslinking reactants (crosslinkers) can also be found in the relevant prior art publications cited at the beginning.
      <br/>
      In this respect, the oleophilic liquid phases selected in accordance with the invention do not entail any basic departures from relevant technical knowledge.
      <br/>
      This applies in particular to all the liquid oils defined in accordance with the invention which contain polar, but non-reactive groups incorporated in the hydrocarbon molecule, i.e. for example to the corresponding ethers and esters.

    <p num="27">
      Potentially interesting liquid oil components which may be used together with the oleophilic oil phases defined in accordance with the invention are the so-called linear  ALPHA -olefins (LAO) and/or the corresponding poly- ALPHA -olefins (PAO).

      The teaching according to the invention encompasses the use of such components.
      <br/>
      Preferred representatives of these olefins correspond in their physical parameters to the values mentioned above for oil phases suitable for the purposes of the invention.
