      A VCO has n inverters connected to each other in a ring, wherein the inverters have a depletion-mode FET.
      <br/>
      A selector control circuit produces a select signal based upon a threshold voltage of a selector depletion-mode FET to select one of an output derived from a (n-i)-th inverter, or another output signal derived from the n-th inverter.
      <br/>
      Because the selector FET and the inverter FETs are made using the same process steps and thus have the same device parameters, the selector FET has the same threshold voltage variation as the inverter FETs.
      <br/>
      Based upon the variation in the FET threshold voltage, the selected output is provided to an input of a first inverter.
      <br/>
      The VCO operates at a constant frequency by changing the total number of inverters in the ring to compensate for the variation in the threshold voltage of the depletion-mode FETs in the inverters, as determined by the depletion-mode FET in the selector circuit.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention generally relates to a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit and a voltage-controlled oscillating method, capable of changing an oscillating frequency in response to an externally supplied control voltage.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention is directed to a technique suitable for realizing a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit by employing a phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventionally, this sort of voltage-controlled oscillator circuit is known as, for instance, a circuit shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      This conventional voltage-controlled oscillator circuit is described more in detailed, for example, in "3 GHz GaAs PLL clock pulse generator" written by T. OKUYAMA and T. ENOMOTO, Shingaku-Giho No. ED93-152 published by the institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers in JAPAN.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As indicated in FIG. 1, the conventional voltage-controlled oscillator circuit has inverters 1011 to 1013.
      <br/>
      These inverters 1011 to 1013 invert a polarity of a signal entered from an input terminal TI, and output the polarity-inverted signal from an output terminal TO.
      <br/>
      In general, such a circuit is referred to as a "ring oscillator".
      <br/>
      This ring oscillator is constituted by connecting the odd number (three inverters in FIG. 1) of inverters in a ring shape.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      That is, the first inverter 1011 is constituted by an enhancement-mode field-effect transistor (E-FET) QE1, a first depletion-mode field-effect transistor (D-FET) QD1, and a second depletion-mode field-effect transistor QD2.
      <br/>
      A source electrode S of the E-FET QE1 is connected to the ground potential, and a gate electrode G thereof is connected to the input terminal TI.
      <br/>
      A gate electrode G of the first D-FET QD1 is connected to a drain electrode of the E-FET QE1, and a source electrode S of this first D-FET QD1 is connected to this drain electrode of the E-FET QE1, and also a drain electrode D thereof is connected to a power supply Vd.
      <br/>
      A source electrode S of the second D-FET QD2 is connected to the drain electrode D of the E-FET QE1, and a drain electrode D of this second D-FET QD2 is connected to the power supply Vd.
      <br/>
      Both a drain electrode D of the E-FET QE1 and a source electrode S of the first D-FET QD1 are connected to the output terminal TO, and a gate electrode G of the second D-FET QD2 is connected to a voltage control terminal Tc.
      <br/>
      A control voltage Vc used to vary an oscillating frequency is applied to this voltage control terminal Tc.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the structures of the inverters 1012 and 1013 are identical to the structure of the above-explained inverter 1011.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In this ring oscillator circuit arrangement, the E-FET QE1 among the respective structural elements of the inverter 1011 is operable as a driver circuit for driving the next-staged inverter 1012, and the first D-FET QD1 constitutes a load of this E-FET QE1.
      <br/>
      The load current flowing through the inverter 1011 may be controlled by connecting the second D-FET QD2 in parallel to this load transistor, namely the first D-FET QD1.
      <br/>
      In this inverter 1011, a current established by summing a constant current flowing through QD1 with a variable current (variable by control voltage Vc) flowing through QD2 will flow.
      <br/>
      This summed current may determine the propagation delay time "tpd" of the inverter 101.

      Since the oscillating frequency of the voltage-controlled oscillator circuit is varied in response to the propagation delay time of the overall circuit arrangement, this oscillating frequency can be controlled based upon the control voltage Vc.
      <br/>
      For instance, when the current flowing through the second D-FET QD2 is decreased by lowering this control voltage Vc, the pull-up ability of QD2 with respect to the power supply Vd is weakened.
      <br/>
      As a result, the propagation delay time tpd of each of the inverters is increased, so that the oscillating frequency of the voltage-controlled oscillator circuit is lowered.

      Conversely, when the current flowing through the second D-FET QD2 is increased by increasing the control voltage Vc, the pull-up ability thereof with respect to the power supply Vd is strengthened.

      An abscissa of the graphic representation shown in FIG. 2 indicates a threshold voltage �V� of the D-FET, whereas an ordinate thereof represents an oscillating frequency �GHz� (VCO oscillating frequency) of this voltage-controlled oscillator circuit.

      In other words, FIG. 2 represents a simulation result of a permitted variation range for various threshold voltages at which the conventional voltage-controlled oscillator can be oscillated in various frequencies, while varying the control voltage from 0.1V to 0.8V. In this simulation, as with this conventional voltage-controlled oscillator circuit, a ring oscillator arranged by 9 sets of inverters with employment of GaAs D-FETs and GaAs E-FETs is employed.

      There are some possibilities that the threshold voltage Vt of the D-FET is shifted, or deviated from the designed value, because of fluctuations occuring when this D-FET is manufactured.
      <br/>
      In this case, while the gate-to-source voltage Vgs of the first D-FET QD1 which constitutes the inverter is a constant voltage (=0�V�), since the value of the current flowing through the first D-FET QD1 is varied, the oscillating frequency is shifted from a desirable frequency.

      A voltage-controlled oscillator circuit is mainly employed in a loop of a PLL circuit, and is required to be oscillated at a preselected frequency (for example, 1�GHz�) in response to an input voltage.

      However, there is a certain possibility that when the above-explained voltage-controlled oscillator circuit is employed in a PLL circuit, since the permitted variation range of the threshold voltage Vt of the D-FET is narrow, this voltage-controlled oscillator cannot be oscillated under stable condition.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">The present invention has been made to solve the above-described problem of the conventional techniques, and therefore, has an object to provide a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit and a voltage-controlled oscillating method, capable of extending a permitted variable range of a threshold voltage of a depletion-mode field-effect transistor, in which the voltage-controlled oscillator can be oscillated at a desirable frequency.</p>
    <p num="20">To achieve the above-described object, a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit, according to a first aspect of the present invention, is featured by comprising:</p>
    <p num="21">
      n (n is an odd positive integer) inverters connected to each other in a serial connection;
      <br/>
      a selector control circuit containing a field-effect transistor as a selector field-effect transistor, for producing a select signal based on a threshold voltage of the selector field-effect transistor; and
      <br/>
      a selector for selecting one of an output signal from an (n-i)-th one (i is an positive integer and smaller than n) of the n inverters and another output signal from an n-th one of the n inverters in response to the select signal produced from the selector control circuit, to supply the selected signal to a first one of the n inverters.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In the voltage-controlled oscillator circuit according to the first aspect, the selector control circuit produces the select signal in such a manner that the threshold voltage of the selector field-effect transistor is smaller than or equal to a preselected value, the selector selects the output signal from the (n-i)-th one of n inverters, and such that when the threshold voltage of the selector field-effect transistor is larger than the preselected value, the selector selects the output signal from the n-th one of n inverter.
      <br/>
      Also, the selector field-effect transistor contained in the selector control circuit is preferably manufactured by a process which is the same as a process of manufacturing field-effect transistors contained in the n inverters.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Concretely speaking, the selector control circuit includes:
      <br/>
      the selector field-effect transistor, a drain electrode of which is connected to a power supply;
      <br/>
      a resistor having two ends, one end of which is connected to a gate electrode of the selector field-effect transistor and a source electrode thereof, and the other end of which is grounded; and
      <br/>
      a flip-flop to which a voltage signal applied from the one end of the resistor is set in synchronism with an externally supplied reset signal, and which supplies the set voltage signal as the select signal to the selector.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Otherwise, the selector control circuit includes:
      <br/>
      the selector field-effect transistor, a drain electrode of which is connected to a power supply;
      <br/>
      another field-effect transistor, a source electrode of which is connected to a ground potential, and a gate electrode and a drain electrode of which are connected to the gate electrode and the source electrode of the field-effect transistor; and
      <br/>
      a flip-flop for setting a voltage signal from the drain electrode of the other field-effect transistor in synchronism with an externally-supplied reset signal, and for supplying the set voltage signal as the select signal to the selector.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The voltage-controlled oscillator circuit, according to the present invention, is featured as follows.
      <br/>
      The selector is provided within the ring counter formed by n inverters.
      <br/>
      The selector control circuit is operated as follows in such a case that the threshold voltage of the depletion-mode field-effect transistor which constitutes the load for the output side of each of the inverters is decreased from the designed value.
      <br/>
      That is, this selector control circuit causes the selector to select the signal entered into one input terminal.
      <br/>
      Conversely, when the above-described threshold voltage is increased from the designed value, this selector control circuit causes the selector to select the signal entered into the other input terminal.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Now, in such a case that the threshold voltage of the selector depletion-mode field-effect transistor is shifted such that this threshold voltage becomes smaller than or equal to a preselected value (designed value), thus propagation delay time of each of the n inverters is thus prolonged to lower the oscillating frequency, and since the output signal from the (n-i)-th one of n inverters is selected by the selector, a total number of inverters for constituting the ring oscillator is thereby decreased, and this ring oscillator is operated to increase the oscillating frequency.</p>
    <p num="27">On the other hand, in such a case that the threshold voltage of the selector depletion-mode field-effect transistor is shifted such that this threshold voltage becomes larger than a preselected value (designed value), the propagation delay time of each of the n inverters is thus shortened to increase the oscillating frequency, and since the output signal from the nth one of the n inverter is selected by the selector, a total number of inverters for constituting the ring oscillator is thereby increased, and this ring oscillator is operated to decrease the oscillating frequency.</p>
    <p num="28">As a consequence, variation in the oscillating frequency caused by changing the threshold voltage of the selector depletion-mode field-effect transistor can by mitigated.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Similarly, to achieve the above-described object, a voltage-controlled oscillating method, according to a second aspect of the present invention, is featured by comprising:
      <br/>
      (a) providing n (n is an odd positive integer) inverters connected to each other in a serial connection;

    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In this voltage-controlled oscillating method according to the second aspect, the (b) step includes:
      <br/>
      (d) judging whether or not the threshold voltage of the selector field-effect transistor is smaller than or equal to a preselected value;
      <br/>
      (e) producing the select signal such that the output signal from the (n-i)-th one of n inverters is selected when a judgement result of the (d) step is made that the threshold voltage of the selector field-effect transistor is smaller than or equal to the preselected value; and
      <br/>
      (f) producing the select signal such that the output signal from the n-th one of n inverters is selected when a judgment result of the (d) step is made that the threshold voltage of the selector field-effect transistor is larger than the preselected value.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In this case, the above-described (d) step includes:
      <br/>
      (g) producing a voltage corresponding to the threshold voltages of each of the n inverters; and
      <br/>
      (h) judging whether or not the threshold voltage of the selector field-effect transistor is smaller than or equal to the preselected value, based on the voltage produced in the (g) step.

      Similarly, to achieve the above-described object, a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit, according to a third aspect of the present invention, is featured by comprising:
      <br/>
      n (n is an odd positive integer) inverters connected to each other in a serial connection;
      <br/>
      select signal producing means containing a field-effect transistor as a selector field-effect transistor, for producing a select signal based on a threshold voltage of the selector field-effect transistor; and
      <br/>
      selecting means for selecting one of an output signal from an (n-i)-th one (i is an positive integer and smaller than the n) of the n inverters and another output signal from an n-th one of n inverters in response to the select signal produced in the select signal producing means, to supply the selected signal to a first one of the n inverters.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In this voltage-controlled oscillator circuit according to the third aspect, the select signal producing means includes:

    <p num="53">
      When the threshold voltage Vt (absolute value) of the first D-FET QD1 contained in each of the inverters is shifted, or deviated so as to increase from the designed value in the above-explained circuit arrangement, the current flowing through this D-FET QD1 is increased.
      <br/>
      As a result, the propagation delay time tpd of each of these inverters is shortened, thereby the oscillating frequency of the voltage-controlled oscillator circuit becomes higher than a desirable frequency.
      <br/>
      In this case, since the sixth D-FET QD6 is manufactured by the same processes as those of the first D-FET QD1, the threshold voltage Vt is increased from the designed value similar to that of the first D-FET QD1.
      <br/>
      As a result, since the current flowing through the sixth D-FET 6 is similarly increased, the current flowing through the resistor R is increased, so that the voltage at the data input terminal D of the flip-flop 31 is increased.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Conversely, in such a case that the threshold voltage Vt (absolute value) of the first D-FET QD1 contained in each of the inverters is decreased from the designed value direction in the above-explained circuit arrangement, the current flowing through this D-FET QD1 is decreased.
      <br/>
      As a result, the propagation delay time tpd of each of these inverters is prolonged, thereby the oscillating frequency of the voltage-controlled oscillator circuit becomes lower than a desirable frequency.
      <br/>
      In this case, since the current flowing through the sixth D-FET 6 is similarly decreased, the current flowing through the resistor R is decreased, so that the voltage at the data input terminal D of the flip-flop 31 is decreased.

      As a result, the selector 2 selects the first input signal IN1.

      As previously explained, since the selector 2 is formed by adding the third E-FET QE3 to the circuit arrangement of the inverter, the propagation delay time tpd of the selector 2 corresponds to two sets of these inverters.

      As a consequence, the overall propagation delay time of the ring oscillator is prolonged by two stages of these inverters, as compared with such a case that the threshold voltage Vt is decreased.

      <br/>
      It should be understood that since the flip-flop 31 is set only when the reset signal Rs is entered, the timing for entering the reset signal Rs is properly selected, it is possible to avoid such a state that the stage number of the ring oscillator is switched while the ring oscillator is being operated.

In other words, FIG. 5 represents a simulation result of a permitted variation range for various threshold voltages at which the below-mentioned voltage-controlled oscillator can be oscillated at various frequencies, while varying the control voltage from 0.1V to 0.8V. In this simulation, the voltage-controlled oscillator circuit employs a ring oscillator.
      <br/>
      This ring oscillator is arranged by 11 sets of inverters (including two sets of inverters for constituting a selector) with employment of GaAs D-FETs and GaAs E-FETs.

As a result, this variable range (0.62V) can be improved by approximately 55%, as compared with the conventional variable range (0.40V).

      Eventually, it is possible to obtain a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit whose permitted variable range for the threshold voltage of the D-FET is widened, as compared with that of the conventional voltage-controlled oscillator circuit.

    <p num="65">Arrangement of Second Voltage-Controlled Oscillator Circuit</p>
    <p num="66">
      Referring now to a drawing, a second embodiment of the present invention will be explained.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 is a circuit diagram for showing an arrangement of a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit according to the second embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this voltage-controlled oscillator circuit according to the second embodiment, a depletion-mode field-effect transistor (D-FET) is employed instead of the resistor R of the selector control circuit according to the first embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      As indicated in FIG. 6, the selector control circuit 4 according to this second embodiment is arranged by a seventh depletion-mode field-effect transistor QD7, an eighth depletion-mode field-effect transistor QD8, and a flip-flop 41.
      <br/>
      A drain electrode D of this eighth D-FET QD8 is connected to the power supply Vd, and both a gate electrode G thereof and a source electrode S thereof are connected to a gate electrode G of the seventh D-FET QD7 and a drain electrode D thereof.
      <br/>
      A source electrode S of the seventh D-FET QD7 is connected to the ground potential.
      <br/>
      The flip-flop 41 is constructed of a D type flip-flop.
      <br/>
      A data input terminal D of this flip-flop 41 is connected to the gate electrode G/source electrode S of the eighth D-FET QD8, and also to the gate electrode G/drain electrode D of the seventh D-FET QD7.
      <br/>
      An output terminal Q of the flipflop 41 is connected to a select terminal S of the selector 2, and then outputs the select signal SEL.
      <br/>
      A reset signal Rs from a control circuit (not shown) is entered into a clock input terminal C of the flip-flop 41.
    </p>
    <p num="68">Operations of Second Voltage-Controlled Oscillator</p>
    <p num="69">Also, in the above-described circuit arrangement of the second embodiment, since the seventh D-FET QD7 can have a similar function as that of the resistor R employed in the first embodiment, it is possible to achieve a similar effect to that of the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="70">Furthermore, since the voltage-controlled oscillator circuit arrangement of this second embodiment no longer requires such a resistor R, the manufacturing process for the resistor can be omitted, resulting in a reduction of manufacturing cost.</p>
    <p num="71">
      With employment of the above-described circuit arrangement, the voltage-controlled oscillator circuits according to the present invention can provide the following advantages.
      <br/>
      That is, this voltage-controlled oscillator circuit contains the selector employed in the ring oscillator, and the selector control circuit.
      <br/>
      In this selector, the output signal derived from (n-2)th inverter is entered into one input terminal of this selector, the output signal derived from n-th inverter is entered into the other input terminal thereof, and any one of these output signals is outputted in response to the select signal.
      <br/>
      The selector control circuit is operated as follows.
      <br/>
      In such a case that the threshold voltage of the depletion-mode field-effect transistor which constitutes the load for the output side of each of the inverters is decreased from the designed value, this selector control circuit causes the selector to select the signal entered into one input terminal.
      <br/>
      Conversely, when the above-described threshold voltage is increased from the designed value, this selector control circuit causes the selector to select the signal entered into the other input terminal.
      <br/>
      As a result, the variation in the oscillating frequency, which is caused by changing the threshold voltage of the depletion-mode field-effect transistor, can be mitigated.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to obtain such a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit having a wide permitted variable range for the threshold voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Also, the selector control circuit includes the flip-flop, the second depletion-mode field-effect transistor, and the third depletion-mode field-effect transistor.
      <br/>
      When the reset signal is inputted to the flip-flop, this flip-flop acquires the voltage applied to the data input terminal, and outputs the select signal in response to this input voltage.
      <br/>
      The source electrode of this second depletion-mode field-effect transistor is connected to the ground potential, and both the gate electrode thereof and the drain electrode thereof are connected to the data input terminal of the flip-flop.
      <br/>
      The source electrode and the drain electrode of the third depletion-mode field-effect transistor are connected to the gate electrode and the drain electrode of the second depletion-mode field-effect transistor, respectively.
      <br/>
      The drain electrode of this third depletion-mode field-effect transistor is connected to the power supply, and further this transistor is manufactured by the same process of the second depletion-mode field-effect transistor.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, the resistor is no longer required, and therefore, since the manufacturing processes for this resistor can be omitted, the total manufacturing cost can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      In particular, the inverter circuit, the first NOR circuit, the second NOR circuit, and the third NOR circuit, which constitute the selector, are arranged by employing the depletion-type field-effect transistors and the enhancement-mode field-effect transistors.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, the voltage-controlled oscillator circuit can be manufactured in the integrated circuit form.
