      A coupling device can connect two cryogenic fluid conduits in fluid communication without creating a temperature change.
      <br/>
      The coupling device includes a fluid flow path extending therethrough having a substantially constant cross-sectional area.
      <br/>
      The coupling device is designed to be easy to connect and disconnect and to provide a secure connection, in particular at low temperature.

      Field of Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to a cryogenic fluid conduit coupling device for connecting two cryogenic fluid conduits to allow fluid communication therebetween.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A cryogenic fluid is a fluid capable of producing very low temperatures.
      <br/>
      Cryogenic fluids, such as, for example, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, have very low sublimation and/or boiling points.
      <br/>
      They are capable of absorbing very large amounts of heat to produce very low temperatures in adjacent materials when they change from one state to another, for example, from a liquid or solid state to a gaseous state.
      <br/>
      In addition, when a compressed gaseous cryogenic fluid is allowed to expand, its temperature decreases and the cryogenic fluid is capable of cooling adjacent materials by absorbing heat from the materials as the compressed fluid expands.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Cryogenic fluids can be useful, for example, in heat exchange apparatus, such as that disclosed in simultaneously filed co-pending U.S. application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/039,443.
      <br/>
      However, a coupling device is often necessary in order to couple the conduit of the cryogenic fluid source to the heat exchange apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Many coupling devices are known for coupling two fluid conduits.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 1,117,762 to Barcus discloses a device for connecting a section of a hose or conduit to another section or to a hydrant.
      <br/>
      The device includes cylindrical outer coupling part 1, which receives a tapered end portion 2" of cylindrical inner coupling part 2.
      <br/>
      The flow path of the coupling part 1 includes an expansion chamber within which a spring 20 is disposed.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,566,489 to Knapp et al. discloses a hydraulic coupling apparatus for connecting fluid lines of a fluid handling system.
      <br/>
      The coupling apparatus includes a male coupler 12 and a female coupler 14.
      <br/>
      Sleeve portion 16 of the female coupler 14 receives tip portion 17 of the male coupler 12 to assemble the couplers together.
      <br/>
      An expansion chamber is formed within sleeve 16 as a result of engagement of a pair of flanges 31 and 32 provided on the outer surface of the tip portion 17 of the male coupler and stop surfaces 41, 42.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,566,723 to Schulze et al. discloses a coupler for hose lines of high-pressure cleaning equipment and high-pressure spraying equipment.
      <br/>
      The coupler includes a hose nipple 2 connected to a hose and surrounded by a sleeve 7.

      The method may be implemented by a device which preferably includes a first coupling portion including a contact face and a fluid path extending therethrough with an opening at the contact face, and a second coupling portion including a contact face and a fluid path extending therethrough with an opening at the contact face.
      <br/>
      When the contact face of the first coupling portion is brought into contact with the contact face of the second coupling portion, the first coupling portion and the second coupling portion are self-guiding with respect to each other to align the respective openings thereof, whereby fluid communication is provided between the first and second coupling portions without creating a temperature change in a cryogenic fluid flowing therethrough.

      <br/>
      As the mating part 14 is inserted into the fluid flow path entrance 54, the protrusions 12 pass through the cut-outs 52a contacting the slide plate 55.
      <br/>
      The slide plate 55 pushes against and compresses the spring 57 as the outer casing 59 and the support members 52, 58 move forward, as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Rotating the male connector portion so that the protrusions 12 are no longer aligned with the cut-outs 52a secures the male connector portion 10 to the female connector portion 50.
