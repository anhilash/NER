      A method for repairing a defect in cartilage, comprising the provision of apertures in the cartilage by drilling holes at the base of the cartilage defect, which holes may enter the mesenchymal depot, introducing a porous scaffold material containing a plurality of magnetic particles into the apertures, and subsequently and sequentially injecting magnetically-tagged cartilage growth promoting materials such as various growth factors or chondrocytes into the area of the defect.
      <br/>
      The magnetically tagged growth promoting material is then drawn into the apertures by magnetic attraction of the magnetic particles contained in the porous scaffold material, either by virtue of the particles being permanently magnetic, or by the imposition of an external magnetic field.
      <br/>
      The present application claims the biodegradable porous scaffold material containing the plurality of magnetic particles.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to the repair of joints of the human body, and is more particularly concerned with a method for repairing damaged cartilage and with means, especially the particular biodegradable scaffolding, utilized in carrying out the method.</p>
    <heading>PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The inability of adult articular cartilage for repair has been well recognized and has stimulated major interest in orthopaedic research.
      <br/>
      Even though considerable progress has been made in the field of articular reconstructive surgery, successful management of large chondral and osteochondral defects and degenerative lesions is still a challenge to the orthopaedic surgeon.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Current treatment is directed at replacement of articular surfaces with total joint reconstructions when sufficient destruction has occurred.
      <br/>
      A far more preferable approach would be to remedy or replace the articular cartilage defects before progressive and debilitating arthritis has occurred.
    </p>
    <p num="5">The number of individuals with symptomatic, identifiable, and potentially treatable cartilage defects is at least an order of magnitude greater than those who currently undergo some form of total joint arthroplasty.</p>
    <p num="6">
      For example, extrapolation of the published research findings for arthroscopic surgery of the knee in the United States would lead to an estimate of significant cartilage damage of the knee in over 250,000 patients.
      <br/>
      Numbers far greater than this are treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID) until their disease has progressed to the stage that a total joint arthroplasty is justifiable.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Multiple research centers in industry and academia are currently involved in pursuing a successful treatment for full thickness cartilage lesions.
      <br/>
      While some approaches are promising, there are currently no commercially viable treatment alternatives to date.
      <br/>
      The current approaches can be summarized into a few basic categories:
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      1.
      <br/>
      Abrasion arthroplasty
      <br/>
      2.
      <br/>

      <br/>

      Perichondrium transplants
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Previous studies have shown that chondrocytes from an allogenic source cultured in a composite collagen gel/fibrillar matrix could be used successfully to repair cartilage surface defects in a rabbit knee joint model (Grande et al; 1987).
      <br/>
      However, it would be clinically superior to be able to repair these defects by mobilizing the intrinsic repair response to push stem cells toward a chondrogenic lineage by the use of growth factors known to be mitogenic to such cells.
      <br/>
      Recent studies have shown that both periosteum and bone marrow have cellular populations that can be isolated in tissue culture and can form cartilage both in vivo and in vitro (Nakahara et al; 1990).
      <br/>
      Miura et al. (1992) have shown that exposure of periosteal tissue to transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) in culture enhances chondrogenesis.
      <br/>
      Additional studies have shown the potent effect of fibroblast growth factor on connective tissue.
      <br/>
      The temporal sequence and bioavailability of growth factors in a wound repair model of articular cartilage are poorly understood.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In the publication, TREATMENT OF DEEP CARTILAGE DEFECTS IN THE KNEE WITH AUTOLOGOUS CHONDROCYTE TRANSPLANTATION, Brittberg et al. disclose the performance of autologous chondrocyte transplantation in 23 people with deep cartilage defects in the knee.
      <br/>
      Healthy chondrocytes obtained from an uninvolved area of the injured knee during arthroscopy were isolated and cultured in the laboratory for 14 to 21 days.
      <br/>
      The cultured chondrocytes were then injected into the area of the defect.
      <br/>
      The defect was covered with a sutured periosteal flap taken from the proximal medial tibia.
      <br/>
      Patients were followed for 16 to 66 months.
      <br/>
      Two years after transplantation 14 of the 16 patients studied with temporal condylar transplants had good to excellent results, with two of the patients requiring a second operation because of severe central wear in the transplants.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The idea that a magnetic field may have application to chondrogenesis or repair of a cartilage defect or treatment of arthritis is not new.
      <br/>
      However, to date, despite considerable research, no current approach is actually being used clinically for treatment of cartilage defects.
      <br/>
      The applications of magnetically related patents may be grouped into the following categories:
    </p>
    <p num="12">(1) The use of opposing magnets to act as an artificial joint.</p>
    <p num="13">(2) Application of a fluctuating magnetic field to induce chondrogenesis.</p>
    <p num="14">(3) Application of a magnetic field to influence the release of an active agent from a scaffolding.</p>
    <p num="15">(4) Creation of magnetic microspheres for intravascular delivery of a tagged agent, most commonly a chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of cancer.</p>
    <p num="16">(5) Contrast agents for NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) imaging enhancement.</p>
    <p num="17">Magnetic means have previously been utilized in the laboratory technique of the prior art.</p>

      This approach built on his previous patents U.S. Pat. No. 4,303,636 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,136,683 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,106,488. This series of patents deals with NMR image improvement and particles which are administered intravenously, the goal being to define metabolic diseases or malignant states.
      <br/>
      Gordon has an additional patent, 1988 U.S. Pat. No. 4,735,796 in which he proposes the use of ferromagnetic, diamagnetic or paramagnetic particles useful in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.

      <br/>
      This approach seeks to create an artificial joint by a series of tack-like structures composed of artificial materials similar to an artificial knee replacement.

      <br/>
      Specifically, his approach requires a capillary bed.

      In Widder U.S. Pat. No. 4,247,406 (1981) the agent is described as intravascularly administered but more specifically described as a biodegradable carrier comprised of micro-spheres formed from an amino acid polymer matrix with magnetic particles embedded therein.

      This patent requires the external culturing and isolation of cells.
      <br/>
      He proposes the formatting of the cells in carriers constructed of collagen or fibrin.

    <p num="47">The foregoing and other objects, advantages, and characterizing features of the invention will become apparent from the following description of certain illustrative embodiments thereof considered together with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals signify like elements throughout the various figures.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="48">
      According to the invention, a clinically viable therapy for osteochondral defects include the implantation of ferromagnetic dipoles in such defects and subsequent staged intra-articular injections of magnetically tagged growth factors.
      <br/>
      The growth factors migrate into the defect and promote chondrogenesis and subsequent repair.
      <br/>
      Successful chondrogenesis is thus achieved in a cascade fashion similar to osteogenesis and clotting.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Clinical application of these principles is achieved by localization of the chondrogenic effect utilizing magnetically directed chondrogenesis.
      <br/>
      The magnetically targeted particles are directed to the cartilage defect through the implantation of ferromagnetic material in the cartilage defect area, which may involve a supplementary external magnetic field.
      <br/>
      This, while more cumbersome, offers the advantage of improved modulation of the process and pulsatile control of the implantation.

    <p num="52">Experimental Design and Methods</p>
    <p num="53">General Methods</p>
    <p num="54">
      Isolation of periosteal culture: Periosteal tissue is isolated from the distal femora and proximal tibia of NZW rabbits.
      <br/>
      In a sterile laminar flow hood, the periostea are placed into a 100 mm. petri dish and with a No. 15 scalpel and forceps are diced into small (1 mm2) pieces.
      <br/>
      The pieces are then transferred into a 60 mm petri dish as explants and prepared for three dimensional culture.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Isolation of marrow mesenchymal stem cells: After periostea have been isolated from the bone surface, the diaphysis of the femora are resected and the marrow cavity is flushed from one end with an injection of Tyrodes balanced salt solution.
      <br/>
      The resulting marrow plug is then prepared into a single cell suspension by successively drawing the tissue through increasingly narrower syringe gores, starting with an 18 gauge syringe and ultimately ending with a 22 gauge.
      <br/>
      The final cell suspension is then passed through a 20  MU m nylon filter.
      <br/>
      Cells are then counted, tested for viability, and then prepared for suspension culture.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Chondrocyte Isolation: Articular cartilage samples obtained from donor rabbits are treated as follows to isolate free chondrocytes.
      <br/>
      The articular cartilage specimens are transferred to a sterile 60 mm petri dish and diced into pieces of approximately 1 mm3 and then transferred to a glass spinner flask.
      <br/>
      To this flask 15 ml of RPM-1640 medium with 25 Mm HEPES buffer (MA Bioproducts) containing clostridial collagenase (Sigma, type 1A 0.37 mg/ml), deoxyribo-nuclease (DNASE) (Worthington, Activity:133 U/mg, 15 mg/ml), testicular hyaluronidase (Sigma, type IS;10 mg/m 1), and penicillin-streptomycin (5,000 u/5000 u; 1% v/v) is added.
      <br/>
      This enzyme-medium mixture is filter-sterilized (0.45 micrometers, nylon membrane) and the samples are spun on a magnetic stirrer at 370 C for 4-6 hours.
      <br/>
      To harvest the cells, extracellular matrix debris is removed by passing the entire medium-cell mixture through a sterile 120  MU m nylon mesh (Nitex Corp.).
      <br/>
      This is followed by centrifuging at 1500 rmp for 5 minutes.

      Referring to FIG. 3, an amalgam containing a metabolically-porous scaffolding material, such as collagen or synthetic alternatives, is added to a magnetically active pellet.
      <br/>
      This cylindrical mass 22 is then injected into the drill holes.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      As shown in FIG. 4, the entire holes may be filled with the porous scaffolding material and magnetic material 22.
      <br/>
      A series of growth factors 32 attached to magnetic particles 26 are then injected into the joint in a timed sequence.
      <br/>
      Continuous passive motion or controlled range of motion exercises and limited weight bearing are applied to the surface, the scaffolding serving to protect the chondrogenesis.

      Sequential injections of various growth factors or chondrocytes which are magnetically tagged may be made at various time intervals.

    <p num="83">
      Referring to FIG. 5, a joint 34 is diagrammatically shown having cartilage defects which have been implanted with magnetic particle-containing scaffolding 36, to which an external magnetic field 38 is applied.
      <br/>
      The magnetic field 38 magnetizes the magnetic particles and causes them to attract the growth factors attached to the magnetically tagged particles which are subsequently injected into the joint in a timed sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="84">Alternatively, the external magnetic field may be utilized to direct the magnetically tagged growth factor to the proper geometric position in the desired sequence in place of the magnetically active pellet which is incorporated in the scaffolding material.</p>

      The magnetic particles implanted at the site of the cartilage defect may be energized by an external magnetic field with a differential effect on the selected growth factors.

      Among the materials which stimulate repair of cartilage are cartilage derived growth factor (CDGF), a cationic polypeptide which stimulates the proliferation of cultured mouse fibroblasts, as well as chondrocytes and endothelial cells, transforming growth factor Beta (TGF-beta), a multi-functional peptide, which regulates the proliferation and differentiation of many cell types.
      <br/>
      Other growth factors are connective tissue activating peptides (CTAP), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).

    <p num="87">
      According to the invention, it has been demonstrated in the laboratory that growth factors can be tagged with a magnetically active particle, and maintain their activity.
      <br/>
      This is the first time that chondrogenic and osteogenic growth factors have been so tagged and the factors demonstrated to be active.
      <br/>
      Specifically, a Partisome particle has been attached to bFGF and to TGF-Beta, and it has been experimentally proved that the growth factor remains biochemically active.

      A polymer has been constructed in the laboratory impregnated with ferromagnetic iron particles.

      It has been further demonstrated that one can attach the Partisome particle to a chondrocyte itself.

      The chondrocyte remains viable, and maintains viability indefinitely.

      Furthermore, it has been shown that the chondrocyte can be localized to a desired area by use of an external magnet, ferromagnetic particles embedded in a biodegradable polymer, and an external magnetic field.

      The magnetic particles which are being employed herein are supplied by Bioquest, Inc. (formerly Molecular Bio-Quest, Inc.) of Atkinson, N.H. The material is disclosed in a patent to Chagnon et al, 1993 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,282) entitled "Biodegradable Magnetic Microcluster Comprising Non-Magnetic Metal or Metal Oxide Particles Coated With a Functionalized Polymer," and forms the basis of the ability to tag the growth factors and the chondrocytes.
      <br/>
      This work builds on a previous patent of same assignee Chagnon et al, 1991 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,071,076) "Method For Producing Magnetic Microparticles From Metallocenes", Chagnon, 1992 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,147,573) "Super-paramagnetic Liquid and Colloids".

      Also related is a patent of Daniel Grande entitled "Technique For Healing Lesions In Cartilage", 1989 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,846,835).
      <br/>
      He proposed at that time that the chondrocytes would be seeded in a three dimensional collagen matrix which served as the graft material.
      <br/>
      The graft would be held in place by a periosteal flap.
      <br/>
      The disclosures of these patents are hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      The Swedish researchers referred to above built on this approach, but did not use any scaffolding.
      <br/>
      It now appears to be the case that the scaffolding, which is present in the actual cartilage defect, interferes with needed chondrogenesis and may not be needed or appropriate.
      <br/>
      The present scaffolding sits in a series of cylinders below the defect and seeks to attract the growth factors or chondrocytes to the site.
