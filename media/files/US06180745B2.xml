    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to moisture-curable compositions containing (cyclo)aliphatically-bound isocyanate groups and succinyl urea groups, which can be cured in the presence of moisture to form coatings, adhesives and sealants.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      It is known that polyisocyanate resins are curable in the presence of atmospheric moisture to form polyurea coatings.
      <br/>
      During the curing mechanism an isocyanate group reacts with moisture to form an amino group, which then reacts with another isocyanate group to form a urea group.
      <br/>
      One of the disadvantages of these moisture-curable resins is that the curing mechanism is relatively slow.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It has been suggested in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,420,800 and 3,567,692 that the curing rate of moisture-curable polyisocyanates can be increased by incorporating either aldimines or ketimines.
      <br/>
      It is stated that the reaction of moisture with an aldimine or ketimine to form the corresponding amine is faster than the reaction of moisture with an isocyanate group to form an amine.
      <br/>
      A disadvantage of the use of aldimines and ketimines to accelerate the cure of polyisocyanates is that it requires the preparation of an additional component and requires some type of metering equipment to ensure that the two components are blended in the proper proportions.
    </p>
    <p num="6">It is an object of the present invention to increase the curing rate of moisture-curable polyisocyanates without the need for a co-reactant.</p>
    <p num="7">
      This object may be achieved with the compositions according to the present invention which contain isocyanate groups and succinyl urea groups as described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      The succinyl urea groups may be formed by the reaction of isocyanate groups with aspartate groups.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Copending applications, U.S. Ser. No. 09/172,751, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,047 and Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/172,584, disclose polyisocyanates that have been modified to contain alkoxysilane groups incorporated through amino or aspartate groups in order to improve the cure rate of the polyisocyanates.
      <br/>
      It is disclosed that the faster curing rates are surprising because alkoxysilane groups, which are also curable in the presence of moisture, cure more slowly than polyisocyanates.
      <br/>
      However, when both isocyanate groups and alkoxysilane groups are present, a faster curing rate is obtained.

    <p num="31">
      The NCO prepolymers, which may also be used as the polyisocyanate component in accordance with the present invention, are prepared from the previously described monomeric polyisocyanates or polyisocyanate adducts, preferably monomeric diisocyanates, and organic compounds containing at least two isocyanate-reactive groups, preferably at least two hydroxy groups.
      <br/>
      These organic compounds include high molecular weight compounds having molecular weights of 500 to about 10,000, preferably 800 to about 8,000, and more preferably 1800 to 8,000, and optionally low molecular weight compounds having molecular weights below 500.
      <br/>
      The molecular weights are number average molecular weights (Mn) and are determined by end group analysis (OH and/or NH number).
      <br/>
      Products obtained by reacting polyisocyanates exclusively with low molecular weight compounds are polyisocyanates adducts containing urethane groups and are not considered to be NCO prepolymers.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Examples of the high molecular weight compounds are polyester polyols, polyether polyols, polyhydroxy polycarbonates, polyhydroxy polyacetals, polyhydroxy polyacrylates, polyhydroxy polyester amides and polyhydroxy polythioethers.

    <p num="33">
      Examples of suitable high molecular weight polyhydroxyl compounds include polyester polyols prepared from low molecular weight alcohols and polybasic carboxylic acids such as adipic acid, sebacic acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid, maleic acid, the anhydrides of these acids and mixtures of these acids and/or acid anhydrides.
      <br/>
      Polylactones having hydroxyl groups, particularly poly- EPSILON -caprolactone, are also suitable for producing the prepolymers.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Also suitable for preparing the prepolymers are polyether polyols, which may be obtained in known manner by the alkoxylation of suitable starter molecules.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable starter molecules include polyols, water, organic polyamines having at least two N--H bonds and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="35">Other suitable polyols include polycarbonates having hydroxyl groups, which may be produced by the reaction of diols with phosgene or diaryl carbonates such as diphenyl carbonate.</p>

      The NCO prepolymers are produced by reacting the diisocyanates with the polyol component at a temperature of 40 to 120 (degree)  C., preferably 50 to 100 (degree)  C., at an NCO/OH equivalent ratio of 1.3:1 to 20:1, preferably 1.4:1 to 10:1.
      <br/>
      If chain extension via urethane groups is desired during the preparation of the isocyanate prepolymers, an NCO/OH equivalent ratio of 1.3:1 to 2:1 is selected.
      <br/>
      If chain extension is not desired, an excess of diisocyanate is preferably used, corresponding to an NCO/OH equivalent ratio of 4:1 to 20:1, preferably 5:1 to 10:1.
      <br/>
      The excess diisocyanate may optionally be removed by thin layer distillation when the reaction is completed.

      In one process at least a portion, preferably all of the isocyanate groups, of the polyisocyanate component are reacted with a compound containing aspartate groups to form a compound containing succinyl urea groups and optionally unreacted isocyanate groups.
      <br/>
      These compounds are then blended with the previously described monomeric polyisocyanates, polyisocyanate adducts or NCO prepolymers to obtain compositions containing the required amount of succinyl urea groups.
      <br/>
      An advantage of this embodiment is that different polyisocyanate components can be used to prepare the compounds containing the succinyl urea groups and for the moisture-curable portion of the composition.

      In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention a portion of the isocyanate groups of the polyisocyanate component are reacted with the compounds containing aspartate groups such that the resulting reaction products contain the required amount of succinyl urea groups and unreacted isocyanate groups.
      <br/>
      No further addition of a polyisocyanate component is necessary with this embodiment.
