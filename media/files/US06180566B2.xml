      No. 08/464,863 filed Sep. 8, 1995 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,795,847, which is a national stage of PCT/DK94/00094, filed Mar. 8, 1994.
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to concentrated herbicide preparations comprising at least one herbicide being fine-grained and suspended in an aqueous electrolyte solution, said herbicide comprising at least one primary, secondary or tertiary amino group and at least one carboxylic acid group and at least one phosphor containing acid group, a process for producing it and an activating, concentrated additive for application in combination with said herbicides.</p>
    <p num="3">
      It is customary to produce herbicide preparations as suspensions in water.
      <br/>
      But normally the content of electrolytes in the aqueous phase is low, since a high content of electrolytes in water has a tendency to lower the solubility of the additives being necessary to stabilize the herbicide suspension.
      <br/>
      Amongst these additives, the surfactants are particularly important, said surfactants being necessary to ensure the wetting in connection with the grinding of the suspended herbicide, and being often desirable in connection with the intrusion of the herbicides in the weeds.
      <br/>
      Often only a few surfactants are suitable to ensure, in an appropriately broad temperature interval from -10 (degree)  C. to approximately 50 (degree)  C., that the suspension is effectively wetted and also flows satisfactorily.
      <br/>
      Additionally the suspensions almost always contain soluble, viscosity regulating compounds, ensuring that the viscosity in a broad temperature interval does not fall below a certain low value in order to avoid precipitation of the suspended herbicide.
      <br/>
      A too high content of electrolytes in the aqueous phase might lead to the gelatination or precipitation of the viscosity regulating compounds.
      <br/>
      The surfactants as well as the viscosity regulating compounds and eventually a certain amount of a dissolved glycol component can ensure, that the suspension after freezing and subsequent unfreezing thaws out again as a flowable, not gritty suspension.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In published european patent application EP 388.239 A1 pesticide suspensions are described, in which a certain amount of electrolytes is desirable.
      <br/>
      The suspension of finely ground pesticides in a concentration from 10-70% by weight in aqueous, structured systems of surfactants is described.
      <br/>
      The following pesticides are mentioned explicitly: ethofumesate, phenmedipham, dazomet, mancozeb, methylene bisthiocyanate, amitraz and triforine.
      <br/>
      None of these pesticides contains both an acid and an amino group.
      <br/>
      The wording "structured systems of surfactants" is intended to mean aqueous systems, in which the surfactants form mesophases comprising structures larger than conventional spherical micelles and mutually interacting to form thixotropy in the aqueous medium.
      <br/>
      The structure comprises multilayers of spherulites or lamellae dispersed or emulsified as rods or discs in an outer aqueous phase, the size being normally 0.5-20  MU m. In the 14 examples of the application the not surface active electrolytes are present in an amount of 1.2-6.4% by weight of the total composition.
      <br/>
      It is a characteristic feature of this system, that the surfactant and the electrolyte must be adapted to each other as regards composition and amount to obtain the desired, stable structure.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Hungarian patent HU 200076 discloses, how the sedimentation tendency of aqueous suspensions may be avoided by addition of electrolytes to the suspensions.
      <br/>
      According to the patent lumps of surfactant will be formed when an electrolyte is added, causing the liquid to be turbid as the stabilisation takes place.
      <br/>
      It is not clearly evident from the patent whether the stabilisation is caused by crystallisation of surfactant on the surface of the suspended pesticide or by crystallisation of surfactant as a new phase (compare EP 388.239), or by the viscoelasticity caused by the precipitation.
      <br/>
      The improved stability is evaluated by centrifugation through indication of the not sedimented part.
      <br/>
      Only one of the samples (table 7) is subjected to normal long term storage.
      <br/>
      The preferred electrolyte is diammonium hydrogen phosphate.
      <br/>
      According to the patent 5-10% diammonium hydrogen phosphate provides optimal effect.
      <br/>
      It is not surprising that addition of electrolyte increases the stability of an aqueous suspension, the viscosity normally being increased and frequently causing the suspension to gelatinate.
      <br/>
      It is contrarily surprising, that the patent does not indicate the viscosity of the evaluated suspensions.
      <br/>
      All the examples comprise glycol, frequently about 10%.
      <br/>
      This addition counteracts the salting-out caused by the electrolyte.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The adjustment of the viscosity of a suspension by changing an eventual content of electrolyte, surfactant and glycol being well-known, this technic, however, is almost never practiced at the final adjustment of viscosity, because the effect is very dependent of temperature and difficult to reproduce.
      <br/>
      Centrifugal tests are notoriously of no relevance for the long term stability of suspensions.
      <br/>
      HU 200076 does not disclose that the amount of emulsifier necessary for sufficient wetting of the suspended pesticide may be reduced when an electrolyte is added.
      <br/>
      Similarly it is not disclosed in HU 200076, that the surfactant or the viscosity regulating polysaccharide may be omitted following the addition of an electrolyte.
      <br/>
      There is a certain overlap between the intervals of added electrolyte in HU 200076 and in the present invention, but the optimal amount of electrolyte in the present invention is above the most effective in HU 200076.
      <br/>
      The described pesticides are atrazine, isoproturon, bensultap, fluomethuron, lindane, thiophanat-methyl and elementary sulfur.
      <br/>
      None of these pesticides comprises a carboxylic acid group or a phosphor containing acid group.

    <p num="7">
      It is well known that ammonium sulphate acts synergistically on the biological effect of glyphosate and glufosinate.
      <br/>
      For instance the patent literature contains many examples of combinations of glyphosate and ammonium sulphate, and in practice the farmer usually adds supplementary ammonium sulphate when diluting the glyphosate for use.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Danish patent application no. 2348/88 describe liquid, aqueous solutions of glyphosate with ethoxylated monoamines as surfactants.
      <br/>
      The possibility of dissolving additional ammonium sulphate exists, but this will lead to a lowering of the dissolvable quantity of glyphosate.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the maximum amount of glyphosate in a solution containing 280 g/l ammonium sulphate is approximately 120 g/l.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      UK patent application GB 2.233.229 A describes a similar system, the ethoxylated monoamines being replaced by ethoxylated diamines.
      <br/>
      The typical, aqueous solutions contain 200 g/l ammonium sulphate and 75 g/l of glyphosate as its isopropylammonium salt.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      UK patent application GB 2.245.170 A claims solutions of glyphosate containing ethoxylated phosphate esters as surfactants.
      <br/>
      In the examples, where ammonium sulphate has been added supplementary to the formulation in amounts of 200-300 g/l, the glyphosate constitutes 75 g/l corresponding to 100 g/l of the isopropylammonium salt.

    <p num="11">
      In European patent application EP 441.764 A1 is mentioned, that alkoxylated, quaternary ammonium compounds especially coethoxylated-propoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds, is environmentally more acceptable and less skin and eye irritating than ethoxylated fatty amines.
      <br/>
      It is stated, that aqueous solutions of glyphosate in combinations with said surfactants also can contain ammonium sulphate, but no examples with such formulations are given.
      <br/>
      On the other hand two solid compositions containing ammonium sulphate are described.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In European patent application EP 498.785 A1 glyphosate formulations are mentioned, which contain esters of sorbitol and fatty acids as surfactants in combination with another surfactant.

      It is mentioned, that these formulations whether aqueous solutions or solid, finely distributed formulations may also contain ammonium sulphate or other inorganic ammonium salts.
      <br/>
      The system, however, seems to be best suited for solid formulations.
    </p>
    <p num="13">European patent application EP 498.145 A1 describes solid compositions containing glyphosate as free acid or salt, an inorganic ammonium salt (preferably ammonium sulphate) and alkyl-glycoside or alkylpolyglycoside as surfactant.</p>

      The formulations shown besides comprise surfactants and frequently ammonium sulphate.

      <br/>
      Furthermore the composition may comprise ammonium sulphate, which is characterized as an adjuvant.
      <br/>
      The form of the ammonium sulphate of the composition is not apparent from the description, but in the 5 examples of the application, the ammonium sulphate together with the glyphosate compound seems to be totally suspended or dissolved only to a limited extent in the liquid phase.

      The application does not mention herbicidal suspensions in relation to the present invention.
      <br/>
      No description is found, neither in the patent description nor in the examples, of significant amounts of glyphosate being at any time suspended in an electrolyte solution and certainly not in a stable form.
      <br/>
      The principles of the present invention for formulating glyphosate, seem never to have been considered.

      Advantageously the formulation is as concentrated as possible.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As far as liquid, dissolved formulations are concerned, the ammonium sulphate has a salting-out effect on the dissolved salts of glyphosate and glufosinate, as well as on the dissolved surfactants, and an upper limit exists of the concentration of the solution dependent on the actual surfactant.
      <br/>
      Environmental requirements on the detergents, for instance as to biodegradability, poor toxicity towards fishes and low skin and eye irritation may reduce still further the number of relevant wetting agents.
      <br/>
      Besides, the various surfactants differ significantly in their promotion of the biological effect of glyphosate and glufosinate.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Therefore, the trend in recent developments is towards solid, finely dispersed and non-dusty formulations.
      <br/>
      Although the solubility of ammonium sulphate in water is big, the speed of dissolution of ordinary, commercial, crystalline ammonium sulphate in water in practice is hardly acceptable.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the crystalline ammonium sulphate frequently needs to be grinded before being mixed with glyphosate or glufosinate or preferably a salt thereof, the selected surfactant(s) and additive(s) being subsequently added.
      <br/>
      Amongst the additives adhesives, absorbing fillers or anticaking agents should be mentioned, which are necessary to obtain a finely dispersed, non-caking and easily flowing, solid formulation of adequate storage stability.
      <br/>
      For these processes an expensive formulation equipment is necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Despite the availability of these new types of highly sofisticated solid formulations, for example micro granulates or finely extruded materials, many users prefer to have liquid formulations.
      <br/>
      One of the reasons is the easier measuring-out of how much of the composition to use, when the formulation is a liquid one.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Besides suppliers of spraying equipment are developing new types of equipment, in which the automatic mixing with the diluent water takes place immediately before spraying, said method being advantageous of several reasons.
      <br/>
      For instance, all the farmer has to do is to fill the water tank with water and place the concentrated pesticide preparation in the spraying equipment, the desired dilution automatically being made when driving.
      <br/>
      In such spraying systems the dosage of liquid formulations will be easier than that of solid formulations.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">The present invention is based on the surprising fact, that a stable suspension can be attained by grinding a powdered herbicide with at least one amino group, at least one carboxylic acid group and at least one phosphor containing acid group in a bead mill in a higly concentrated solution of an electrolyte, which is not a surfactant per se, even if no surfactant is present.</p>
    <p num="27">In order to explain in greater detail the reasons for the above fact being surprising, a number of requirements normally to be met when producing a stable suspension concentrate of a herbicide in a liquid phase--a so-called "flowable"--are listed below.</p>
    <p num="28">
      1) The herbicide must be very poorly soluble in the actual liquid, for instance water, because when soluble to a certain extent in the liquid, the dissolved part of the herbicide, by cooling of the liquid, will precipitate, mainly on the biggest of the fine, solid particles present in the preparation, leading to crystal growth.
      <br/>
      When reheated mainly the smallest crystals of herbicide will dissolve and so on.
      <br/>
      At constantly fluctuating temperatures, which is normally the case in practice, this means a continuous crystal growth and an increased sedimentation tendency.
      <br/>
      This will normally give rise to serious storage problems.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      2) It is necessary to add a surfactant to ensure optimal wetting of the suspended particles of herbicide in the liquid.
      <br/>
      If the wetting is unsufficient, the suspension will become thick and consequently impossible to grind in wet condition in a bead mill.
    </p>
    <p num="30">3) It is necessary to add a viscosity regulating agent in order to stabilize the final two-phased preparation.</p>
    <p num="31">
      4) It is necessary to add dissolved additives, which ensure that the product after drastic cooling and possibly freezing again thaws into a stable and homogenous form without forming gritty lumps.
      <br/>
      This can be obtained by adding electrostatically acting dispersion agents, polymers (acting sterically hindering) and glycol compounds (lowering the freezing point of the liquid).
      <br/>
      Frequently a combination of these additives is used.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILS</heading>
    <p num="32">Herbicides with at least one primary, secondary and/or tertiary amino group, at least one carboxylic acid group and at least one phosphor containing acid group normally have a relatively high solubility in water: about 0.1 corresponding to 1000 ppm or more, preferably at least 0.4% corresponding to 4000 ppm; by way of example the solubility of glyphosate is approximately 1% by weight in pure water at 20 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="33">
      By addition of an electrolyte during suspension in an aqueous phase crystal growth of suspended herbicide is prevented, in fact a salting out of the herbicide takes place.
      <br/>
      However, as mentioned above, a high content of electrolyte prevents the usual addition of additives mentioned under items 2, 3 and 4 above, apart from the freezing point lowering glycol compounds, said additives being normally regarded as absolutely necessary for forming stable herbicide suspensions.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      According to the invention, the wet grinding of a compound, which is almost insoluble in the liquid phase, seems to take place without serious viscosity problems, even if no surfactant is added.
      <br/>
      This is very untypical.
      <br/>
      The reason could be, that the herbicide molecule contains an amino group as well as two acid groups.
      <br/>
      This explanation is made probable by the fact, that the surfactants being most difficult to salt out in electrolyte solutions, are those containing both negatively and positively charged hydrophilic groups.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The fact, that the grinding can take place without viscosity problems, even when no surfactant is added, is probably an essential condition for realising the invention.
      <br/>
      Even if a surfactant were added, the salting out from the electrolyte of the compound would generally be so extensive, that the wetting effect of the insignificant amount still dissolved in the water phase would be too small to influence significantly on the grinding.
      <br/>
      The surfactant, however, is still desirable.
      <br/>
      As mentioned above said surfactant is necessary to ensure the optimum, biological effect of the formulation, and it might contribute to the stabilization of the final formulation, i.e. ensure that the formulation remains homogenous and does not separate.
      <br/>
      Apparently the finely grinded suspended herbicide and the added, finely distributed surfactant mutually interact to produce a mixture of an advantageous pseudoplastic or thixotropic character.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to produce stable formulations comprising as the sole components water with dissolved electrolyte, suspended glyphosate and surfactant.
      <br/>
      It is even possible to produce stable suspensions using no surfactants at all.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      When a surfactant is included in the suspension the surfactant mainly appears to be uniformly distributed on the finely grinded herbicide particles.
      <br/>
      This fact might contribute further to the stabilization of compositions, inter alia the coating causes the density differences between the suspended and the liquid phase to be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="37">There is some overlap regarding type of formulation and possible components between the present invention and French patent application 2.661.315. It is therefore relevant to explain the differences between the two systems.</p>
    <p num="38">
      In the French application the liquid phase mainly comprises an organic solvent, while the present invention particularly uses water, which economically and usually environmentally is the most advantageous solvent.
      <br/>
      But that difference is not the decisive one.
      <br/>
      The fact that the electrolyte according to the present invention is not suspended in the liquid phase, but normally totally dissolved in it, is far more important.
      <br/>
      It leads to the following advantages:
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      a) The grinding of the ammonium sulphate is avoided (it is difficult to describe this advantage, but the ammonium sulphate is so hard and difficult to grind, and these difficulties can really only be understood through practical experience in the laboratory).
      <br/>
      After all it seems correct to conclude, that even if the ammonium sulphate is pregrinded in dry condition, the final grinding on the bead mill gives rise to great problems regarding material tear, low production speed and risk of production stop.
      <br/>
      b) An adjustment of the density of the grinded herbicide and the density of the electrolyte solution in order to minimize the difference is possible, whereby the separation tendency in the suspension becomes very low.
      <br/>
      By coating the surfactant on the suspended herbicide further variations can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In French application 2.661.315, the herbicide as well as the electrolyte has to be suspended in the liquid phase, and there is accordingly no such possibility of adjusting the density of the liquid phase or of coating the suspended particles with the surfactants.
      <br/>
      c) By dissolving the electrolyte in a liquid phase a desirable lowering of the solubility of the suspended herbicide is obtained.
      <br/>
      Hereby a greater long term stability is obtained, because the risk of crystal growth is reduced (a generally accepted fact regarding suspension preparations).
      <br/>
      d) In suspension preparations the amount of suspended solid material in a liquid phase must be below a certain upper limit.
      <br/>
      Normally the practical limit is about 500 g/l suspension.
      <br/>
      In glyphosate preparations containing ammonium sulphate the desired content of ammonium sulphate as well as that of glyphosate is high, and this is not possible to obtain if both compounds are to be suspended.
      <br/>
      When the ammonium sulphate is dissolved in the water phase and the glyphosate only is dispersed herein, it is possible to increase the amounts of ammonium sulphate as well as glyphosate.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Consequently the present invention differs from the description and the 5 examples in French application 2.661.315 by having at least 5% by weight of electrolyte dissolved in the liquid, continuous phase.
      <br/>
      Example 5 of the present application shows differences between the two systems and clarifies the advantages of having the electrolyte dissolved in the liquid phase.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The herbicide preparations being stable means, that the suspended herbicide in concentrated form does not precipitate or separate into solid lumps, which on shaking of the preparation in the commercial packing can not be resuspended in the liquid.
      <br/>
      Moreover the herbicide preparations must be able to stand storage in the commercial packing for at least 12 year under normal storage conditions.
      <br/>
      The preparations being on concentrated form means, that the product is in a commercial packing and that a dilution must take place before use.
    </p>
    <p num="42">The invention accordingly relates to stable, concentrated herbicide preparations comprising at least one herbicide in an amount of 5-58% by weight, said herbicide being fine-grained and suspended in a liquid aqueous phase, and said herbicide containing at least one primary, secondary or tertiary amino group, at least one carboxylic acid group and at least one phosphor containing acid group, said herbicide preparations being characterized by comprising at least 5% by weight of an electrolyte, which is dissolved in the liquid, aqueous phase and, which is not a surfactant.</p>
    <p num="43">If nothing else is stated, the indication "% by weight" or "%" in the present application means % by weight of the total composition.</p>
    <p num="44">
      For economical reasons it is advantageous, that the suspensions are as concentrated as possible.
      <br/>
      On the other hand the solubility properties of the electrolytes determines the minimum of the water content.
      <br/>
      The lower limit for the water content is low, because a part of the water theoretically can be substituted by an organic, water miscible solvent, which is also able to dissolve the electrolyte.
      <br/>
      In the preferred suspensions of the invention, the water content is max. 65%, preferably max. 60%, especially max. 55%, particularly max. 50% and specially max. 45%, compare claim 2; in the suspensions the water content is generally min. 12%, preferably min. 15%, especially min. 20%, particularly min. 25% and specially min. 30%, i.e. intervals of for instance 12-65%, preferably 15-60%, especially 20-55%, particularly 25-50% and specially 30-45%.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The liquid, aqueous phase should be continuous regarding water, but can contain water miscible, organic solvents.
      <br/>
      The amount of water in the continuous solvent phase will normally constitute at least 52%, preferably at least 55%, especially at least 60%, particularly at least 67% and specially at least 75% calculated as % by weight of the total amount of solvent in the liquid and continuous, aqueous phase (compare claim 3). (Water is calculated as solvent).
    </p>
    <p num="46">Said suspended herbicides with at least one amino group, at least one carboxylic acid group and at least one phosphor containing acid group will frequently be such, where the phosphor containing acid group is selected from amongst phosphonic acids and phosphinic acids.</p>
    <p num="47">Specially preferred herbicides are glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)-glycine), glufosinate (4-(hydroxy(methyl)phosphinoyl)-DL-homoalanine), bilanafos (4-hydroxy(methyl)phosphinoyl)-L-homoalanyl-L-alanyl-L-alanin) and/or glyphosine (N,N-bis(p-hosphionomethyl)glycine), compare claim 4.</p>
    <p num="48">
      The actual suspended herbicides of the invention are applicable as such, i.e. in their free, non-neutralized form, or they can be reacted with acid or base into completely or partly neutralized salts, compare claim 5.
      <br/>
      Amongst the acidic salts, hydrochlorides and sulfuric acid salts should be mentioned.
      <br/>
      Salts formed by reaction with base are for instance alkanolamine salts, amine salts, sodium salts and potassium salts and especially ammonium salts.
      <br/>
      Amongst the more special salts, trimethylsulfonium and trimethylsulfoxonium salts should be mentioned.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Preferably the suspended herbicide is present in its free, non-neutralized form or as a mixture of a salt and free, non-neutralized form comprising max. 80%, preferably max. 70%, especially max. 60% and specially max. 50% of the herbicide transformed into a salt or, as a third possibility, comprising min. 50%, preferably min. 60%, especially min. 70% and specially min. 80% of the herbicide transformed into a salt like an ammonium salt or a metal salt (by "%" is meant mole percents).
      <br/>
      Since the herbicide contains two or more acid groups, the transformation into salt is to be calculated for the most acidic acid group only, the other groups being not included in the calculation.
    </p>
    <p num="50">Specially preferred suspensions are those, in which the herbicides are in their free, non-neutralized form or completely or partly reacted with ammonia into the respective ammonium salts, compare claim 6.</p>
    <p num="51">The amount of the suspended herbicide in the compositions of the invention is preferably min. 10%, especially min. 14%, particularly min. 18% and specially min. 21%; on the other hand the suspended herbicide constitutes max. 51%, especially max. 44%, particularly max. 38% and specially max. 33% so, i.e. intervals of for instance preferably 10-51%, especially 14-44%, particularly 18-38% and specially 21-33%, compare claim 7.</p>
    <p num="52">
      The described herbicide suspensions are generally characterized by the fact that said herbicides, when dissolved in water (1 part concentrate to 99 parts of water, eventually to 499 parts of water) dissolves completely in the diluent water.
      <br/>
      The pH in a 1% solution in water is min. 1, preferably min. 1.5, especially min. 2 and specially min. 2.5. The pH will normally be max. 7, preferably max. 6, especially max. 5 and specially max. 4.4 so, i.e. intervals of pH of for instance 1-7, preferably 1.5-6, especially 2-5 and specially 2.5-4.4.
    </p>
    <p num="53">If desired, different herbicides in combination can be used in the herbicide suspensions of the invention.</p>
    <p num="54">The invention also relates to stable, activating additives (adjuvants) on concentrated form, said adjuvants being active when admixed with glyphosate- and/or glufosinate preparations for combatting weeds, and said additives comprising at least one surfactant in an amount of 4-58% by weight, said surfactant being emulsified, suspended and/or dissolved in a liquid, aqueous phase; the composition of the adjuvant being further characterized by comprising at least one undissolved, fine-grained, not biologically active viscosity regulating filler acting to prevent separation of the surfactant, said viscosity regulating filler comprised in an amount of min. 0.3% by weight, and said liquid, aqueous phase being characterized by comprising an electrolyte, which is dissolved in the liquid, aqueous phase and, which is not a surfactant, in an amount of min. 5%, compare claim 19.</p>
    <p num="55">Such a stable, activating additive is in a way an intermediate Lor the production of a concentrated suspension of glyphosate and/or glufosinate according to the invention, since the herbicide suspension can be produced from the additive simply by admixing finely grinded herbicide.</p>
    <p num="56">
      To produce the herbicidal solution/suspension for use, the farmer may make use of the additive, too.
      <br/>
      He just has to mix it with a glyphosate- or a glufosinate preparation.
      <br/>
      The form of the herbicide is of minor importance in this connection, for instance a finely grinded powder, a solid granulate, a solution in an appropriate solvent or even a suspension may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The wording "electrolyte", whether used in connection with the herbicide preparations or the additive according to the invention, is intended to mean a single salt or a single salt or a mixture of two or more salts.

    <p num="64">
      Furthermore the composition may comprise limited amounts of undissolved electrolyte.
      <br/>
      But usually this undissolved electrolyte will be undesirable, because of stability and succeeding solubility problems.
      <br/>
      A content of undissolved electrolyte might result from a separation at low temperatures.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Under certain special conditions, however, it is desirable for the composition to comprise undissolved electrolyte (salt).
      <br/>
      This will be the case, if the undissolved salt is coated and therefore can not dissolve before the composition is mixed with water before the spraying in the field.
      <br/>
      Under such conditions crystal growth of the salt is prevented, and the extra content of coated and dispersed salt can enhance the biological effect of the preparation.

      Even though the presence of a surfactant in the herbicide suspension of the invention is desirable for biological reasons, a suspension comprising no surfactant has commercial interest, because of the possibility of adding separately the surfactant at the admixing stage of said suspension with the diluent water.
      <br/>
      The surfactant might be formulated as an activating additive according to the invention.
      <br/>
      The advantage of this system is, that the farmer may adjust individually the surfactant to the amount of herbicide.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      It is possible to adjust the suspension to enable most surfactants to physically enter it.
      <br/>
      The suspended herbicide helps preventing the surfactant from separating out.
      <br/>
      The surfactant is generally present in the suspension in a non-structured form.
      <br/>
      Therefore in most of the described herbicide suspensions comprising a surfactant, the surfactant will separate as an independent, liquid phase or as solid particles in case the suspended herbicide and solid additives, if any, are removed from the suspensions.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      The present invention does not relate to the final dilutions made at the user level.
      <br/>
      The invention relates to concentrates only, being herbicide preparations or activating additives, which according to the invention are formulated in a new and more advantageous way.
      <br/>
      Since dilutions of use, made from the concentrates to a certain extent are well known, because they can be obtained by separate addition of ammonium sulphate to known products, and they are known to posses a particularly satisfying biological effect, it seems redundant to proove the effect of the described compositions.
      <br/>
      There might be differences in the pH-values of the dilutions.
      <br/>
      For instance the pH-value of the herbicide preparations according to the invention is frequently low, because the glyphosate is preferably used in its non-neutralized form, but this fact is known to be of no biological importance.
      <br/>
      Reference is made in this connection to Danish patent application 6490/89, specially dealing with glyphosate on non-neutralized form.

      At low electrolyte concentration, the viscosity regulating compound might be a water soluble polymer being completely or partly dissolved (swelled) in the water phase.

      The herbicide suspension according to the invention is usually produced by a process, where the herbicide and eventually other components are grinded and admixed with the other components.

      The grinding and possibly the admixing may preferably take place in a bead mill, compare claim 17, for instance at a temperature in the interval of 0-50 (degree)  C. In order to maintain the temperature in this interval cooling of the bead mill with water or ice water will usually be necessary.
      <br/>
      If the surfactant has a higher melting point, it might be desirable to raise the temperature of the mill to 50-60 (degree)  C. for a period.
      <br/>
      This may be effected by temporarily stopping the cooling water.
      <br/>
      The surfactant is added in the molten state at the higher temperature, and finely grinded filler, if any, is usually added before the cooling with cooling water is resumed.

      To this solution either acid or base is added to precipitate the herbicide in completely or partly free non-salt form; the electrolyte solution is formed from the rest of the salt initially having formed salt with the herbicide, and the added amount of acid or base, and the precipitation is controlled so as to produce particles of a sufficiently small size to reduce or preferably leave out the subsequent grinding on the bead mill.
      <br/>
      In order for the herbicide particles to become of a sufficiently small size, the addition of acid or base preferably takes place as controlled as possible, which normally means, that the addition takes place during simultaneous cooling and/or vigorous stirring and/or through a suitable injector system.

      Experiments 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25 and 26-29 in the tables B, C, D, E, and F describe glyphosate compositions comprising various surfactants in varying amounts.
      <br/>
      The ratio glyphosate/surfactant is about 2/1 corresponding to the usual ratio in most commercial products.
      <br/>
      The amount of finely distributed fillers varies from 0 to 2% by weight.
      <br/>
      In all of the experiments the amount of the electrolyte ammonium sulphate is varying from app. 20 to 27% by weight.
      <br/>
      The grinding is performed in a mini-mill as described for the samples 3-5 in table A, the sulfuric acid addition, however, being omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="128">The melting points of Marlipal 1618/25 and Radiasurf 7417 are about 55 (degree)  C. Therefore, the mixtures in experiments 26 and 27 were heated to 50-55 (degree)  C. during the addition of Marlipal and Radiasurf.</p>
    <p num="129">Evaluation and conclusion:</p>
    <p num="130">
      No tendency to separate sticking sediments was observed in any of the examples.
      <br/>
      After shaking the flowing properties seem acceptable.
      <br/>
      A subsequent re-evaluation of the experiments revealed that air bubbles by mistake under the microscope had been regarded as oil drops.
      <br/>
      No separate oil layers were seen.
      <br/>
      The speeds of dissolution in water are generally very good.
    </p>
    <p num="131">No relevant comparison with other suspension preparations can be made, because of the aqueous suspension preparations, dissolving in the diluent water, being an unusual type of formulation.</p>

      Experiments 36-40 (table H) show the use of potassium thiocyanate, sodium bromide and ammonium acetate as electrolyte.
      <br/>
      In the experiments 36 and 37, one of the acid groups in glyphosate is transformed into the sodium salt.
      <br/>
      In experiment 38, a little amount only of glyphosate is transformed into the sodium salt.
      <br/>
      In experiments 39 and 40, one of the acid groups in glyphosate is transformed into its ammonium salt.
      <br/>
      The experiments 41-45 (table I) relate to compositions comprising viscosity regulating, hygroscopic compounds.
      <br/>
      These are glycerine, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and lactic acid.
      <br/>
      Obviously the addition of these to the aqueous phase caused no tendency to separation of undissolved electrolyte.
      <br/>
      Experiments 46 and 47 relate to compositions further comprising oil.
      <br/>
      Experiment 48 and 49 relate to compositions comprising herbicide suspended in an electrolyte solution and small amounts of a viscosity regulating filler, but no surfactant.
    </p>
    <p num="139">The grinding is performed in a mini-mill as described above for the samples 3-5 in table A, the sulfuric acid addition being omitted.</p>
    <p num="140">In experiment 40 the composition comprising Marlipal 1618/25 was temporarily heated.</p>
    <p num="141">Evaluation and conclusion.</p>
    <p num="142">
      After shaking, the flowing properties seem satisfactory.
      <br/>
      The speeds of dissolution of the samples of experiments 34 and 35 comprising no surfactant, are inferior to those of the other samples, but acceptable anyhow.
      <br/>
      Generally speaking the speeds of dissolution are very good.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      In the experiments 46 and 47, the oils apparently do not disperse onto the grinded glyphosate, unlike the surfactants.
      <br/>
      This conclusion is based partly on the microscopy and partly on the experiment 46, in which the sample, which had been stored at varying temperatures, at the end of the experiment had separated two upper, clear phases.
      <br/>
      This was not observed in experiment 47.
      <br/>
      In both samples, the oil was uniformly re-distributed in the compositions after shaking.
    </p>
    <p num="144">All samples from these experiments are at least acceptable.</p>

    <p num="159">EXAMPLE 5</p>
    <p num="160">The purpose of the example is to illustrate the difference between the present invention and French application 2.661.315.</p>
    <p num="161">
      In the French application, the most hydrophilic solvent mixture and the mixture comprising the most water, is the mixture in example 1, comprising 250 g water and 300 g propylene glycol per liter.
      <br/>
      This mixture, therefore, is able to dissolve the most ammonium sulphate. 5% by weight of the weight of 1 liter product (1192 g) is 59.6 g. In experiment 56 (table M) this amount of ammonium sulphate is dissolved in the actual amount of water (250 g) followed by addition of the cited amount of propylene glycol (300 g) (both per liter product).
      <br/>
      A fast precipitation of ammonium sulphate is observed.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      The actual surfactant of the French example 1, a derivative of an ethoxylated fatty amine, is not commercially available, and is synthesized from ethylene oxide (extremely poisonous).
      <br/>
      Experiments 57 and 58 are intended to show, that compounds being comparable to this surfactant do not solubilize the ammonium sulphate.
      <br/>
      Consequently the amount of dissolved ammonium sulphate in example 1 in FR 2.663.315 can not exceed 5% w/w.
      <br/>
      Genamin S 25 is the most ethoxylated of the commercially available ethoxylated fatty amines.
      <br/>
      In experiment 57 Genamin S 25 is admixed with propylene glycol, before the mixture is added to the ammonium sulphate solution.
      <br/>
      PEG 400 is polyethylene glycol comprising on an average 8 moles of ethylene glycol.
      <br/>
      Since this compound does not comprise any hydrophobic group, it is more hydrophilic than ethoxylated fatty amines, and therefore probably has a greater impact on the solubility of ammonium sulphate.
      <br/>
      In experiment 58 PEG 400 is admixed with the propylene glycol, before the mixture is added to the ammonium sulphaate solution.
      <br/>
      Both example 57 and 58 show a precipitation of ammonium sulphate following the addition of the propylene glycol mixtures to the aqueous ammonium sulphate solutions.
    </p>
    <p num="163">Conclusion.</p>
    <p num="164">None of the compositions in the examples of FR 2.661.315 comprises 5 w/w or more of dissolved ammonium sulphate.</p>

      The viscosity was measured at 20 (degree)  C. by means of a Brookfield RVF-viscosimeter (gear 20).
      <br/>
      The much higher viscosity in experiment 60, comprising only half as much ammonium sulphate as experiment 59, is caused by the fact, that the ammonium sulphate in experiment 59 is totally dissolved in the liquid, aqueous phase, whereas the ammonium sulphate in experiment 60 is predominantly dispersed in the 50% w/w propylene glycol-/water phase.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      At normal temperatures an ammonium sulphate solution comprises approximately 40% ammonium sulphate.
      <br/>
      In experiment 61 20 g ammonium sulphate was dissolved in the water phase followed by addition of propylene glycol, causing a precipitation of ammonium sulphate.
      <br/>
      Another 20 g ammonium sulphate was finely grinded in a blender with a view to adding it slowly during grinding before the addition of glyphosate, before the addition of Genapol and after the addition of Genapol, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="171">
      In practice, the grinding showed up to be impossible, because the crystals of ammonium sulphate were too hard to grind and stopped the filter, keeping the pearls in the mill.
      <br/>
      Accordingly it was impossible to grind the ammonium sulphate in experiment 62, where no water was present to dissolve part of the ammonium sulphate.
    </p>
    <p num="172">Experiments 61 and 62 show, that ammonium sulphate precipitated as fine crystals from an aqueous solution by addition of a water-miscible, organic solvent gives rise to no problems, whereas finely grinded crystals of ammonium sulphate are difficult to grind further on a bead-mill.</p>
