    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates a dial programming switch comprises, especially, a switch structure which can be connected to a pin bank connector, and manufactured easily.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cost is reduced greatly.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The prior art dial programming switch includes a seat, an upper cover, a plurality of push button, and terminal sets.
      <br/>
      The terminal sets include a first terminal and a second terminal.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a conductive terminal is installed on the push button.
      <br/>
      By the pushing of the push button, the conductive terminal may selectively control the conduction of the first terminal and second terminal for determining the ON and OFF states of a switch.
      <br/>
      Such kinds of patent can refer to Taiwan Patent Publication Nos. 291180, 311730, 308350, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, in the prior art dial programming switch, each push button needs to assemble with a conductive terminal with much working time and hours.
      <br/>
      Thus the manufacturing process is complex so that the cost is high.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      The push button 30 can move forwards and backwards above the receiving groove 11.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, by the matching of the positioning grooves 33 and 34 of the push button 30 and the positioning spots 22 and 23 of the upper cover 20, an elastic stage in moving the push button 30 is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Each terminal set 40 includes a first terminal 41 and a second terminal 42.
      <br/>
      The first terminal 41 and the second terminal 42 are made of conductive material.
      <br/>
      The first terminal 41 has a first body 43 with a U shape cross section.
      <br/>
      The first body 43 is fixed in a first terminal receiving hole 12 of the seat 10.
      <br/>
      Two sides of the lower end of the first body 43 are extended with two cambered clamping portions 44.
      <br/>
      The upper end of the first body 43 is connected to a first contact portion 45 extended horizontally.
      <br/>
      The middle portion of the first contact portion 45 slightly protrudes with a convex portion 49.
      <br/>
      The first contact portion 45 is installed in the receiving groove 11 of the seat 10.
      <br/>
      The second terminal 42 has a second body 46 with an approximately U shape cross section.
      <br/>
      The second body 46 is fixed in the second terminal receiving hole 13 of the seat 10.
      <br/>
      The two sides of the lower end of second body are extended with two cambered clamping portions 47.
      <br/>
      The upper end of the second body 46 has an approximately horizontal second contact portion 48 which is installed at the receiving groove 11 of the seat 10.
      <br/>
      The second contact portion 48 is positioned below the first contact portion 45 with a proper distance.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      After the push button 30 and the terminal set 40 are assembled to the seat 10, the upper cover 20 can cover the upper end of the seat 10.
      <br/>
      The lower ends of the four sides of the upper cover 20 are located on the flange 14 at the four sides of the seat 10, and it can be buckled with the buckling hole 24 of the upper cover 20 by the buckling body 15 of the seat 10.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, supersonic wave welding serves to weld the contact surface therebetween and the protrusion 32 of each push button 30 protrudes from the groove 21 of the upper cover 20.
      <br/>
      The pushing portion 35 of the push button 30 ejects against the top of the first contact portion 45 of the first terminal 41.
      <br/>
      Thereby, a dial programming switch is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In the present invention, by moving the protrusion 32 of the push button 30, the push button 30 can be driven to be moved forwards and backwards above the receiving groove 11 of the seat 10.
      <br/>
      Thereby, by the pushing portion 35 at the bottom of the push button seat 31, it may selectively contact with the convex portion 49 of the first terminal 41.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, as the push button 30 moves backwards, the pushing portion 35 of the push button 30 will separate from the convex portion 49 on the first contact portion 45 of the first terminal 41.
      <br/>
      The first contact portion 45 of the first terminal 41 will not contact with the second contact portion 48 of the second terminal 42.
      <br/>
      Now, the switch is off.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 5, as the push button 30 moves forwards, the pushing portion 35 of the push button 30 will eject against the convex portion 49 on the first contact portion 45 of the first terminal 41 so as to push the first contact portion 45 to move downwards.
      <br/>
      Thus, the first contact portion 45 of the first terminal 41 will make contact with the second contact portion 48 of the second terminal 42.
      <br/>
      Then, the switch is on.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the present invention, by the integrally formed first contact portion 45 of the first terminal 41 and the convex portion 49 to move upwards and downwards, the contact between the first contact portion 45 of the first terminal 41 and the second contact portion 48 of the second terminal 42 is controlled so as to select the switch to be in an OFF or ON state.
      <br/>
      The first terminal 41, second terminal 42, and convex portion 49 are integrally formed.
      <br/>
      It can be manufactured easily.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cost is reduced greatly.
      <br/>
      The conductive terminal assembled in a push button for controlling the conduction of the first terminal and the second terminal as that in the prior art technology need not be used in the present invention.
    </p>
