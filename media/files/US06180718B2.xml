      A process for the attachment of aromatic or heteroaromatic rings to a polymeric support via a silyl ether linkage is described.
      <br/>
      Such process involves the synthesis of a chlorodialkyl aryl or heteroarylsilane which is then coupled to a polymeric support via a hydroxyl functionality to form a polymer-bound silyl ether.
      <br/>
      Further modification provides a polymer-bound small organic molecule that is cleaved from the polymeric support under mild conditions to give an aryl or heteroaryl silanol or a compound in which the aryl or heteroaryl carbon-silicon bond is replaced with a carbon-hydrogen, carbon-halogen, carbon-hydroxyl, carbon-sulfur, or carbon-carbon bond.
      <br/>
      Such methods are useful for the preparation of a library of diverse aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds by both manual and automated synthesis.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention pertains to processes in solid-supported organic synthesis which have utility in the construction of libraries of molecules bearing aromatic or heteroaromatic functionality that are to be screened for biological activities which would render them useful as pharmaceuticals or agrochemicals.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it pertains to the use of aryl- and heteroaryl-silyl ethers in linking synthetic intermediates to a solid-support during an organic synthesis, methods for attaching starting materials and methods for cleaving final products.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Combinatorial chemistry and automated organic synthesis have proven to be highly effective means for the generation of multiplicities of novel molecules known as libraries.
      <br/>
      As the size of such a library grows, so does the likelihood that it will contain individual molecules with useful biological activities which may be employed in the treatment of human, animal, and plant diseases.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      One strategy for increasing the speed at which novel libraries can be generated is to attach a synthetic starting material, also known as a synthon, to a solid-support.
      <br/>
      Subsequent synthetic transformations are carried out on the solid-supported synthon to elaborate it into the molecules of interest which are either tested for biological activity while still attached to the support or cleaved from the support prior to biological evaluation.
      <br/>
      Efficiency is introduced into the syntheses relative to traditional solution methods because tedious and time consuming purifications at each intermediate synthetic step are reduced to a simple filtration and rinsing of the polymer supported intermediate.
      <br/>
      Solid-supported methodologies, combined with automation can dramatically increase the rate at which a library of synthetic molecules may be prepared.
      <br/>
      While the disciplines of solid-supported peptide and nucleic acid chemistry are well known and have been widely practiced, the solid-supported synthesis of small organic molecules with pharmaceutical and agrochemical utility is a burgeoning science.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Since an overwhelming majority of pharmaceutical and agrochemical agents bear at least one aromatic or heteroaromatic ring, flexible processes for attachment of aromatic and heteroaromatic synthons to solid supports have tremendous value to those interested in generating libraries of molecules with pertinent biological activities.
      <br/>
      Cleavage of carbon-silicon bonds by ipso-desilylation is a strategy by which an aromatic or heteroaromatic ring may be cleaved from a silicon ether linkage to a polymeric support.
      <br/>
      A major advantage of this method is that it is possible to have no trace of the linker remain in the target molecule, unlike the amide and ester linkages commonly used in solid-supported peptide chemistry, which leave a portion of the linker functionality, typically acid, ester, amide, amine or phenol behind.
      <br/>
      Proto-ipsodesilylations will provide pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals in which the carbon-silicon bond is replaced with a carbon-hydrogen bond.
      <br/>
      By using other ipso-desilylation reactions, it is also possible to incorporate desirable functionality which is unrelated to the linker by replacing the carbon-silicon bond with carbon-oxygen, carbon-sulfur, carbon--carbon or carbon-halogen bonds in the course of cleavage from the solid-support.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      WO 95/16712 describes silicon-based polymer resins and silane linkers, methods for their preparation and their use in the synthesis of libraries of aromatic carbocycles to be screened as pharmaceutical agents.
      <br/>
      Plunkett and Ellman describe "A Silicon-Based Linker for Traceless Solid-Phase Synthesis in The Journal of organic Chemistry, 1995, 60, 6006-6007.
      <br/>
      Both of these disclosures pertain to the use of silane linkers in solid-supported organic synthesis which involve chemically distinct processes for attachment and cleavage of molecules to and from solid-supports from the instant invention which involves silyl ether linkers.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      This disclosure involves the use of silicon bearing polymers to which sugar molecules are attached and cleaved via silicon-oxygen forming and breaking reactions which is also chemically distinct from the instant invention wherein molecules are attached to a solid support by silicon-oxygen bond formation and cleaved by silicon-carbon bond breaking.
      <br/>

    <heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">Accordingly, the present invention is a process for preparing pharmaceuticals or agrochemicals comprising:</p>
    <p num="8">
      a) An aryllithium or heteroaryllithium reagent is first reacted with a dichlorosilane forming a silicon-carbon bond;
      <br/>
      b) The resulting aryl-chlorosilane is reacted in one or more synthetic steps with a solid-supported hydroxyl group to form a silicon-oxygen bond (silyl ether) which thereby links the aromatic or heteroaromatic synthon to the solid support;
      <br/>
      c) The solid-supported aromatic or heteroaromatic synthon is elaborated, in one or more synthetic steps, into solid-supported molecules which, when detached from the support, afford pharmaceuticals or agrochemicals.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      Specifically, the instant invention pertains to the use of silyl ethers in the attachment of molecules bearing aromatic and heteroaromatic rings to solid-supports for the purpose of engaging in solid-supported organic synthesis of libraries of small organic molecules.
      <br/>
      The use of silyl ethers in this fashion requires methods for forming silicon-carbon bonds between the aromatic or heteroaromatic ring and a dichlorosilane, methods for formation of a silicon-oxygen bond between the resulting aryl-chlorosilane and a solid-supported hydroxyl group, knowledge of the range of compatible solid-supports to which this hydroxyl group is attached, and methods for selective cleavage of a silicon-carbon bond that will liberate the desired product from the solid-support.

      <br/>
      The resin-bound silyl ether is prepared by reacting the chlorodialkylarylsilane with hydroxymethyl resin (available from Bachem Calif., 1.00 meq/g) in the presence of an acid scavagner, such as imidazole, in DMF.
      <br/>
      Resin-bound silyl ethers analogous to 3 in Scheme I can be prepared from the properly substituted chloro or sulfonyl dialkylsilane and any solid-support containing a reactive hydroxyl functionality.
      <br/>
      The aryl-chlorosilane can also be first converted to an aryl-hydroxysilane and then activated by treatment with diethylazodicarboxylate and triphenylphosphine before reacting with a solid-supported hydroxyl group to generate a silyl-ether linkage.
      <br/>
      Preferably for the instant invention hydroxymethyl resin and Wang resin, however the following may also be used: a solid-supported hydroxyl group derived from HO(CH2)n X(CH2)m -polystyrene wherein: X is O, S, C(.dbd.O)NH, NHC(.dbd.)O, N(Me)C(.dbd.O), C(.dbd.O)O, or OC(.dbd.O); n is an integer from 1 to 6 and m is zero or one, a solid-supported hydroxyl group derived from HO(CH2)n X-polyethyleneglycol-polystyrene composite polymer wherein: X is O, S, C(.dbd.O)NH, NHC(.dbd.)O, N(Me)C(.dbd.O), C(.dbd.O)O, or OC(.dbd.O) and n is an integer from 1 to 6, a solid-supported hydroxyl group derived from HO(CH2)n C(.dbd.O)-MBHA resin or HO(CH2)n C(.dbd.O)--BHA resin and n is an integer from 1 to 6, a solid-supported hydroxyl group derived from (4-hydroxyphenyl)--(CH2)p X(CH2)m -polystyrene wherein: X is O, S, C(.dbd.O)NH, NHC(.dbd.)O, N(Me)C(.dbd.O), C(.dbd.O)O, or OC(.dbd.O); p is an integer from 0 to 6 and m is zero or one or a solid-supported hydroxyl group derived from (4-hydroxyphenyl)-(CH2)p X-polyethyleneglycol-polystyrene composite polymer wherein: X is O, S, C(.dbd.O)NH, NHC(.dbd.)O, N(Me)C(.dbd.O), C(.dbd.O)O, or OC(.dbd.O) and p is an integer from 0 to 6.

      The reaction is carried out in the presence of an acid scavanger (such as, but not limited to, imidazole, pyridine, 2,6-lutidine or DMAP) in an aprotic solvent (such as, but not limited to, DMF, DMA or DMSO).  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)

    <p num="18">Cleavage of the silicon-oxygen bond is illustrated in Scheme I.

      It will be obvious to one skilled in the art, that derivatization of the resin-bound aryl silyl ethers is not limited to the chemical reactions shown in Schemes II-V and that other conventional chemistries can be applied to the intermediates disclosed herein.

      Scheme II depicts derivatization of resin-bound aryl silyl ether intermediate.

      Thus, treatment of resin-bound silyl ether 1 (3-Scheme I) with n-butyllithium in the presence of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylene diamine in diethyl ether followed by quenching with dry dimethylformamide gives the resin-bound silyl ether intermediate 2.
      <br/>
      Preparation of resin-bound intermediates similar to 2 in Scheme II can be formed from an appropriately substituted dialkyl aryl or heteroaryl silyl ether with a strong base (such as, but not limited to n-BuLi, t-BuLi, LDA, or LiTMP) and quenching with a suitably reactive reagent (such as, but not limited to, aldehydes, amides, acid chlorides, alkyl halides or carboxylic esters) in a suitable solvent (such as, but not limited to THF or diethyl ether).

      Reaction of resin-bound silyl ether intermediate 2 in Scheme II with the aryllithium generated from para-methoxybromobenzene and n-butyllithium in THF, provides the resin-bound silyl ether intermediate alcohol 3.

      Again, it will be obvious to one skilled in the art, that analogues of 3 can be formed by reacting an alternative aryllithium or heteroaryllithium, generated from an arylbromide or properly substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic compound with a strong base (such as, but not limited to, n-BuLi, t-BuLi or LDA) in a suitable solvent (such as, but not limited to THF or diethyl ether).

      Scheme III illustrates cleavage of the carbon-silicon bond of the resin-bound silyl ether.

      Proto-ipsodesilylation of resin-bound silyl ether was carried out using tetrabutylammonium fluoride or TAS-F in DMF or another aprotic solvent or a mixture of aprotic solvents at 65 (degree)  C.

      Alkylation of the resulting resin-bound phenol with 1-bromo-3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone in the presence of diisopropylethylamine and NMP at 80 (degree)  C. provides resin-bound silyl ether intermediate 3.  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="24">Reaction of the resin-bound phenol can be carried out with other reactive species (such as, but not limited to, alkyl halides, alkyl sulfonates, acid chlorides or carboxylic esters) in the presence of a base (such as, but not limited to, Et3 N, or LiHMDS) in an aprotic solvent (such as, but not limited to DMF, THF, NMP or DMSO).</p>
    <p num="25">
      Scheme V depicts annulation of the resin-bound silyl ether 3 (1-Scheme V).
      <br/>
      Treatment of resin-bound silyl ether intermediate 1 with DBU in NMP gives the resin-bound benzofuran.
      <br/>
      A similar transformation could be carried out using an alternative base (such as, but not limited to, LiHMDS, LDA or LiTMP) in an appropriate solvent such as THF or diethyl ether.  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The resin-bound benzofuran is finally cleaved from the resin using tetrabutylammonium fluoride or TAS-F in DMF or another polar-aprotic solvent at 65 (degree)  C. Alternatively, the carbon-silicon bond could be cleaved using molecular bromine or iodine in dichloromethane or chloroform which would result in the formation of a carbon-halogen bond.
      <br/>
      The carbon-silicon bond could also be cleaved to form a carbon-oxygen bond by treatment of 2 in Scheme V with tetrabutylammonium fluoride and an oxidizing agent (such as, but not limited to, hydrogen peroxide or peracetic acid) or an electrophilic sulfur reagent (such as , but not limited to, dialkyldisulfide).
      <br/>
      And finally, the carbon-silicon bond could be cleaved to form a carbon--carbon bond by treatment with TAS-F in DMF or another polar-aprotic solvent followed by quenching with a reactive species (such as, but not limited to, alkyl halides of alkyl sulfonates).
