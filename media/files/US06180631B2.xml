    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The following description of the background of the invention is provided to aid in understanding the invention but is not admitted to be prior art to the invention.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Cellular signal transduction is a fundamental mechanism whereby external stimuli regulating diverse cellular processes are relayed to the interior of cells.
      <br/>
      One of the key biochemical mechanisms of signal transduction involves the reversible phosphorylation of proteins, which enables regulation of the activity of mature proteins by altering their structure and function.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The best characterized protein kinases in eukaryotes phosphorylate proteins on the alcohol moiety of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues.
      <br/>
      These kinases largely fall into two groups, those specific for phosphorylating serine and threonine, and those specific for phosphorylating tyrosine.
      <br/>
      Some kinases, referred to as "dual specificity" kinases, are able to phosphorylate on tyrosine as well as serine/threonine residues.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Protein kinases can also be characterized by their location within the cell.
      <br/>
      Some kinases are transmembrane receptor proteins capable of binding ligands external to the cell membrane.
      <br/>
      Binding the ligands alters the receptor protein kinase's catalytic activity.
      <br/>
      Others are non-receptor proteins lacking a transmembrane domain.
      <br/>
      Non-receptor protein kinases can be found in a variety of cellular compartments from the inner-surface of the cell membrane to the nucleus.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Many kinases are involved in regulatory cascades where their substrates may include other kinases whose activities are regulated by their phosphorylation state.
      <br/>
      Ultimately the activity of a downstream effector is modulated by phosphorylation resulting from activation of such a pathway.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The serine/threonine kinase family includes members that regulate many steps of signaling cascades, including cascades controlling cell growth, migration, differentiation, gene expression, muscle contraction, glucose metabolism, cellular protein synthesis, and regulation of the cell cycle.</p>
    <p num="8">
      An example of a non-receptor protein kinase that phosphorylates protein targets on serine and threonine residues is RAF.
      <br/>
      RAF modulates the catalytic activity of other protein kinases, such as the protein kinase that phosphorylates and thereby activates mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK).
      <br/>
      RAF itself is activated by the membrane anchored protein RAS, which in turn is activated in response to ligand activated tyrosine receptor protein kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR).
      <br/>
      The biological importance of RAF in controlling cellular events is underscored by the finding that altered forms of RAF can cause cancer in organisms.
      <br/>
      Evidence for importance of RAF in malignancies is provided in Monia et al., 1996, Nature Medicine 2: 668, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety including all figures and tables.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In an effort to discover novel treatments for cancer and other diseases, biomedical researchers and chemists have designed, synthesized, and tested molecules that inhibit the function of protein kinases.
      <br/>
      Some small organic molecules form a class of compounds that modulate the function of protein kinases.
      <br/>
      Examples of molecules that have been reported to inhibit the function of protein kinases are bis monocyclic, bicyclic or heterocyclic aryl compounds (PCT WO 92/20642), vinylene-azaindole derivatives (PCT WO 94/14808), 1-cyclopropyl-4-pyridyl-quinolones (U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,992), styryl compounds (by Levitzki, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,217,999, and entitled "Styryl Compounds which Inhibit EGF Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase, Lyon &amp; Lyon Docket No. 208/050), styryl-substituted pyridyl compounds (U.S. Pat. No. 5,302,606), certain quinazoline derivatives (EP Application No. 0 566 266 A1), seleoindoles and selenides (PCT WO 94/03427), tricyclic polyhydroxylic compounds (PCT WO 92/21660), and benzylphosphonic acid compounds (PCT WO 91/15495).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The compounds that can traverse cell membranes and are resistant to acid hydrolysis are potentially advantageous therapeutics as they can become highly bioavailable after being administered orally to patients.
      <br/>
      However, many of these protein kinase inhibitors only weakly inhibit the function of protein kinases.
      <br/>
      In addition, many inhibit a variety of protein kinases and will therefore cause multiple side-effects as therapeutics for diseases.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Despite the significant progress that has been made in developing compounds for the treatment of cancer, there remains a need in the art to identify the particular structures and substitution patterns that form the compounds capable of modulating the function of particular protein kinases.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The present invention is directed in part towards methods of modulating the function of serine/threonine protein kinases with 5-azaquinoxaline-based compounds.
      <br/>
      The methods incorporate cells that express a serine/threonine protein kinase, such as RAF.
      <br/>
      In addition, the invention describes methods of preventing and treating serine/threonine protein kinase-related abnormal conditions in organisms with a compound identified by the methods described herein.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the invention pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds identified by methods of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="13">I. Methods for Screening Compounds that Modulate Serine/Threonine Protein Kinase Function</p>
    <p num="14">
      The methods of the present invention provide means for modulating the function of both receptor and cytosolic serine/threonine protein kinases.
      <br/>
      These methods provide means of modulating the enzymes both in vitro and in vivo.
      <br/>
      For in vitro applications, the methods of the invention relate in part to method of identifying compounds that modulate the function of serine/threonine protein kinases.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Thus, in a first aspect, the invention features a method of modulating the function of a serine/threonine protein kinase with an azabenzimidazole-based compound.
      <br/>
      The azabenzimidazole compound is optionally substituted with organic groups.
      <br/>
      The method comprises contacting cells expressing the serine/threonine protein kinase with the compound.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The term "function" refers to the cellular role of a serine/threonine protein kinase.
      <br/>
      The serine/threonine protein kinase family includes members that regulate many steps in signaling cascades, including cascades controlling cell growth, migration, differentiation, gene expression, muscle contraction, glucose metabolism, cellular protein synthesis, and regulation of the cell cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The term "catalytic activity", in the context of the invention, defines the rate at which a protein kinase phosphorylates a substrate.
      <br/>
      Catalytic activity can be measured, for example, by determining the amount of a substrate converted to a product as a function of time.
      <br/>
      Phosphorylation of a substrate occurs at the active-site of a protein kinase.
      <br/>
      The active-site is normally a cavity in which the substrate binds to the protein kinase and is phosphorylated.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The term "substrate" as used herein refers to a molecule phosphorylated by a serine/threonine protein kinase.
      <br/>
      The substrate is preferably a peptide and more preferably a protein.
      <br/>
      In relation to the protein kinase RAF, preferred substrates are MEK and the MEK substrate MAPK.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The term "activates" refers to increasing the cellular function of a protein kinase.
      <br/>
      The protein kinase function is preferably the interaction with a natural binding partner and most preferably catalytic activity.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The term "inhibit" refers to decreasing the cellular function of a protein kinase.
      <br/>
      The protein kinase function is preferably the interaction with a natural binding partner and most preferably catalytic activity.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The term "modulates" refers to altering the function of a protein kinase by increasing or decreasing the probability that a complex forms between a protein kinase and a natural binding partner.
      <br/>
      A modulator preferably increases the probability that such a complex forms between the protein kinase and the natural binding partner, more preferably increases or decreases the probability that a complex forms between the protein kinase and the natural binding partner depending on the concentration of the compound exposed to the protein kinase, and most preferably decreases the probability that a complex forms between the protein kinase and the natural binding partner.
      <br/>
      A modulator preferably activates the catalytic activity of a protein kinase, more preferably activates or inhibits the catalytic activity of a protein kinase depending on the concentration of the compound exposed to the protein kinase, or most preferably inhibits the catalytic activity of a protein kinase.

    <p num="29">In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to the method of modulating the function of a serine/threonine protein kinase, where the protein kinase is RAF.</p>
    <p num="30">
      The RAF protein kinase phosphorylates protein targets on serine or threonine residues.
      <br/>
      One such protein target is the protein kinase (MEK) that phosphorylates and consequently activates mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK).
      <br/>
      RAF itself is activated by the membrane-bound guanine triphosphate hydrolyzing enzyme RAS in response to mitogen-stimulated receptor protein tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR).

    <p num="31">
      The methods of the present invention can detect compounds that modulate the function of the RAF protein kinase in cells.
      <br/>
      RAF phosphorylates a protein kinase (MEK) which in turn phosphorylates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
      <br/>
      Assays that monitor only the phosphorylation of MEK by RAF are not sensitive because the phosphorylation levels of MEK are not significant.
      <br/>
      To overcome this sensitivity dilemma, the phosphorylation of both MEK and MAPK are followed in the assays of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The MAPK phosphorylation signal amplifies the MEK phosphorylation signal and allows RAF-dependent phosphorylation to be followed in assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays.

      Methods of Preventing or Treating Abnormal Conditions
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      In another aspect, the invention features a method of preventing or treating an abnormal condition in an organism.
      <br/>
      The method comprises the following steps: (a) administering a compound of the invention, as specified herein by formula I with any of the constraints provided herein, to an organism; and (b) promoting or disrupting the abnormal interaction.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The term "organism" relates to any living entity comprising at least one cell.
      <br/>
      An organism can be as simple as one eukaryotic cell or as complex as a mammal.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, an organism refers to humans or mamals.
    </p>
    <p num="59">The term "preventing" refers to the method of the invention decreasing the probability, or eliminating the possibility, that an organism contracts or develops the abnormal condition.</p>
    <p num="60">The term "treating" refers to the method of the invention having a therapeutic effect and at least partially alleviating or abrogating the abnormal condition in the organism.</p>
    <p num="61">
      The term "therapeutic effect" refers to the inhibition of cell growth causing or contributing to an abnormal condition (e.g. cancer).
      <br/>
      The term "therapeutic effect" also refers to the inhibition of growth factors causing or contributing to the abnormal condition.
      <br/>
      A therapeutic effect relieves to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the abnormal condition.
      <br/>
      In reference to the treatment of a cancer, a therapeutic effect refers to one or more of the following: (a) a reduction in tumor size; (b) inhibition (i.e., slowing or stopping) tumor metastasis; (c) inhibition of tumor growth; and (d) relieving to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the abnormal condition.
      <br/>
      Compounds demonstrating efficacy against leukemias can be identified as described herein, except that rather than inhibiting metastasis, the compounds may instead slow or decrease cell proliferation or cell growth.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The term "abnormal condition" refers to a function in the cells or tissues of an organism that deviates from their normal functions in that organism.
      <br/>
      An abnormal condition can relate to cell proliferation, cell differentiation, or cell survival.
    </p>
    <p num="63">Aberrant cell proliferative conditions include cancers such as fibrotic and mesangial disorders, abnormal angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, wound healing, psoriasis, diabetes mellitus, and inflammation.</p>
    <p num="64">Aberrant differentiation conditions include, but are not limited to neurodegenerative disorders, slow wound healing rates, and tissue grafting techniques.</p>
    <p num="65">
      Aberrant cell survival conditions relate to conditions in which programmed cell death (apoptosis) pathways are activated or abrogated.
      <br/>
      A number of protein kinases are associated with the apoptosis pathways.
      <br/>
      Aberrations in the function of any one of the protein kinases could lead to cell immortality or premature cell death.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival are phenomena simply measured by methods in the art.
      <br/>
      These methods can involve observing the number of cells or the appearance of cells under a microscope with respect to time (for example, days).
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The term "administering" relates broadly to the provision to an organism and more specifically to a method of incorporating a compound into cells or tissues of an organism.
      <br/>
      The abnormal condition can be prevented or treated when the cells or tissues of the organism exist within the organism or outside of the organism.
      <br/>
      Cells existing outside the organism can be maintained or grown in cell culture dishes.
      <br/>
      For cells harbored within the organism, many techniques exist in the art to administer compounds, including (but not limited to) oral, parenteral, dermal, injection, and aerosol applications.
      <br/>
      For cells outside of the organism, multiple techniques exist in the art to administer the compounds, including (but not limited to) cell microinjection techniques, transformation techniques, and carrier techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="68">In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method of preventing or treating an abnormal condition in an organism, where the 5-azaquinoxaline-based compound has a structure set forth in formula I as defined herein or any of the subgroups thereof set forth herein.</p>
    <p num="69">In other preferred embodiments, the invention relates to a method of preventing or treating an abnormal condition in an organism, where the 5-azaquinoxaline-based compound, having a structure set forth in formula I, is selected from the group consisting of SAQAR compounds.</p>
    <p num="70">In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method of preventing or treating an abnormal condition in an organism, where the organism is a mammal.</p>
    <p num="71">The term "mammal" refers preferably to such organisms as mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and goats, more preferably to monkeys and apes, and most preferably to humans.</p>
    <p num="72">In yet another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method of preventing or treating an abnormal condition in an organism, where the abnormal condition is cancer or a fibrotic disorder.</p>
    <p num="73">In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method of preventing or treating an abnormal condition in an organism, where the cancer is selected from the group consisting of lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, brain cancer, intra-axial brain cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, sarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, melanoma, and glioma.</p>
    <p num="74">In still another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method of preventing or treating an abnormal condition in an organism, where the method applies to an abnormal condition associated with an aberration in a signal transduction pathway characterized by an interaction between a serine/threonine protein kinase and a natural binding partner.</p>
    <p num="75">
      The term "signal transduction pathway" refers to the propagation of a signal.
      <br/>
      In general, an extracellular signal is transmitted through the cell membrane to become an intracellular signal.
      <br/>
      This signal can then stimulate a cellular response.
      <br/>
      The term also encompases signals that are propagated entirely within a cell.
      <br/>
      The polypeptide molecules involved in signal transduction processes are typically receptor and non-receptor protein kinases, receptor and non-receptor protein phosphatases, nucleotide exchange factors, and transcription factors.
    </p>
    <p num="76">The term "aberration", in conjunction with a signal transduction process, refers to a protein kinase that is over- or under-expressed in an organism, mutated such that its catalytic activity is lower or higher than wild-type protein kinase activity, mutated such that it can no longer interact with a natural binding partner, is no longer modified by another protein kinase or protein phosphatase, or no longer interacts with a natural binding partner.</p>
    <p num="77">
      The term "promoting or disrupting the abnormal interaction" refers to a method that can be accomplished by administering a compound of the invention to cells or tissues in an organism.
      <br/>
      A compound can promote an interaction between a protein kinase and natural binding partners by forming favorable interactions with multiple atoms at the complex interface.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a compound can inhibit an interaction between a protein kinase and natural binding partners by compromising favorable interactions formed between atoms at the complex interface.
    </p>
    <p num="78">In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method of preventing or treating an abnormal condition in an organism, where the serine/threonine protein kinase is RAF.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="138">
      The present invention is directed in part towards methods of modulating the function of serine/threonine protein kinases with 5-azaquinoxaline-based compounds.
      <br/>
      In addition, the invention relates in part to methods for identifying compounds that modulate the function of serine/threonine protein kinases.
      <br/>
      The methods incorporate cells that express a serine/threonine protein kinase, such as RAF.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      RAF is a non-receptor protein kinase that is recruited to the cell membrane when it binds to activated RAS, a guanine triphosphate hydrolyzing enzyme.
      <br/>
      RAS is activated when an activated receptor protein tyrosine kinase, such as EGFR or PDGFR, bind to an adaptor protein, GRB2, and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, SOS.
      <br/>
      SOS removes guanine diphosphate from RAS, replaces it with guanine triphosphate, and thereby activates RAS.
      <br/>
      RAS then binds RAF and consequently activates RAF.
      <br/>
      RAF may then phosphorylate other protein targets on serine and threonine residues, such as the kinase (MEK) that phosphorylates and consequently activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
      <br/>
      Thus, RAF serves as an intermediary controlling factor in mitogen-activated signal transduction.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      Due to the important regulatory role of RAF in cells, modifications to the amino acid sequence of RAF can alter its function and consequently modify cellular behavior.
      <br/>
      RAF's role in cell proliferation is underscored by the observation that mutations to RAF's amino acid sequence have been associated with tumors and cancers.
      <br/>
      Because the mutations to RAF that give rise to cancer in cells lead to RAF molecules that display unregulated catalytic activity, inhibitors of RAF may alleviate or even abrogate the cell proliferation that leads to cancer in these cells.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      Methods of the present invention can detect compounds that modulate the function of the protein kinase RAF in cells.
      <br/>
      RAF phosphorylates a protein kinase (MEK) which in turn phosphorylates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
      <br/>
      Assays that monitor only the phosphorylation of MEK by RAF are not sensitive because the phosphorylation levels of MEK are not significant.
      <br/>
      To overcome this sensitivity dilemma, the phosphorylation of both MEK and MAPK are followed in the assays of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The MAPK phosphorylation signal amplifies the MEK phosphorylation signal and allows RAF-dependent phosphorylation to be followed in enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays.
      <br/>
      In addition, the assay of the invention is preferrably performed in a high throughput format such that many compounds can be rapidly monitored in a short period of time.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      The methods of the present invention have identified compounds that inhibit the function of RAF protein kinase.
      <br/>
      These compounds are 5-azaquinoxaline-based derivatives.
      <br/>
      Although 5-azaquinoxaline-based derivatives have been tested for their ability to inhibit enzymes involved with nucleotide synthesis in bacteria, many of these compounds have not yet been significantly explored with respect to protein kinase inhibition.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      Because RAF exhibits significant amino acid homology to other serine/threonine protein kinases, the 5-azaquinoxaline-based compounds of the invention may likely inhibit serine/threonine protein kinases other than RAF.
      <br/>
      Thus, the methods of the invention also relate to serine/threonine protein kinases other than RAF, including receptor and non-receptor serine/threonine protein kinases.
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      The methods of the invention also pertain to other compounds that modulate RAF function in cells as the high throughput aspect of the methods allows a wide array of molecules to be tested in a short period of time.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the methods of the invention can identify existing molecules not disclosed in the present invention that modulate RAF function.

    <p num="146">
      5-azaquinoxaline-based compounds of the present invention were tested for their ability to inhibit RAF protein kinase function.
      <br/>
      The biological assays and results of these inhibition studies are reported herein.
      <br/>
      The methods used to measure 5-azaquinoxaline-based compound modulation of protein kinase function are similar to those described in PCT WO 98/07695 A1 by Tang et al., and entitled "Indolinone Combinatorial Libraries and Related Products and Methods for the Treatment of Disease," (Lyon &amp; Lyon Docket No. 221/187), filed Aug. 23, 1996, with respect to the high throughput aspect of the method.

    <p num="147">II. Target Diseases to be Treated by 1,4,5-Triazanaphthalene-Based Compounds</p>
    <p num="148">
      The methods, compounds, and pharmaceutical compositions described herein are designed to inhibit cell proliferative disorders by modulating the function of the RAF protein kinase.
      <br/>
      Proliferative disorders result in unwanted cell proliferation of one or more subsets of cells in a multicellular organism resulting in harm to the organism.
      <br/>
      The methods, compounds, and pharmaceutical compositions described herein may also be useful for treating and preventing other disorders in organisms, such as disorders related to premature cell death (i.e., neurological diseases) or inflammation.
      <br/>
      These disorders may be a result of RAF molecules that function inappropriately or a result of RAF-related protein kinase molecules that function inappropriately.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      Alterations in the function of the RAF protein kinase or protein kinases related to RAF can lead to enhanced or decreased cell proliferative conditions evident in certain diseases.
      <br/>
      Aberrant cell proliferative conditions include cancers, fibrotic disorders, mesangial disorders, abnormal angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, wound healing, psoriasis, restenosis, and inflammation.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      Fibrotic disorders relate to the abnormal formation of the cellular extracellular matrix.
      <br/>
      An example of a fibrotic disorder is hepatic cirrhosis.
      <br/>
      Hepatic cirrhosis is characterized by an increased concentration of extracellular matrix constituents resulting in the formation of a hepatic scar.
      <br/>
      Hepatic cirrhosis can cause diseases such as cirrhosis of the liver.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      Mesangial cell proliferative disorders occur due to the abnormal proliferation of mesangial cells.
      <br/>
      Mesangial proliferative disorders include various human renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes, transplant rejection, and glomerulopathies.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      Preferred types of cancers that may be treated by the methods and compounds of the invention are lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, brain cancer, intra-axial brain cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, melanoma, and glioma.
      <br/>
      Evidence that the compounds and methods of the invention can effectively be utilized to stem and reverse the proliferation of cancer cells is provided herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      Angiogenic and vasculogenic disorders result from excess proliferation of blood vessels.
      <br/>
      Blood vessel proliferation is necessary in a variety of normal physiological processes such as embryonic development, corpus luteum formation, wound healing and organ regeneration.
      <br/>
      However, blood vessel proliferation is also essential in cancer tumor development.
      <br/>
      Other examples of blood vessel proliferative disorders include arthritis, where new capillary blood vessels invade the joint and destroy cartilage.
      <br/>
      In addition, blood vessel proliferative diseases include ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, where new capillaries in the retina invade the vitreous, bleed and cause blindness.
      <br/>
      Conversely, disorders related to the shrinkage, contraction or closing of blood vessels, such as restenosis, are also implicated in adverse regulation of protein kinases.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      Moreover, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are associated with the growth of malignant solid tumors and metastasis.
      <br/>
      A vigorously growing cancer tumor requires a nutrient and oxygen rich blood supply to continue growing.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, an abnormally large number of capillary blood vessels often grow in concert with the tumor and act as supply lines to the tumor.
      <br/>
      In addition to supplying nutrients to the tumor, the new blood vessels embedded in a tumor provide a gateway for tumor cells to enter the circulation and metastasize to distant sites in the organism.

    <p num="155">
      Inappropriate RAF activity can stimulate cell proliferative disorders.
      <br/>
      Molecules specifically designed to modulate the function of the RAF protein kinase have been shown to inhibit cellular proliferation.
      <br/>
      Specifically, antisense nucleic acid molecules, which are designed to both bind to message RNA encoding the RAF protein kinase and block translation from that message, effectively reversed transformation of A549 cells in vitro.
      <br/>
      Monia et al., 1996, Nature Medicine 2: 688, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety including all figures and tables.
      <br/>
      A549 cells are human malignant cells.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      These RAF-targeted antisense studies provide evidence that the 5-azaquinoxaline molecules of the invention, which modulate the function of the RAF protein kinase, can stem, and likely reverse, the proliferation of malignant cells in an organism.
      <br/>
      These 5-azaquinoxaline compounds can be tested in the in vitro methods provided herein by example.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the 5-azaquinoxaline compounds may be tested for their effect upon tumor cells in vivo by the xenograft methods also provided herein by example.
    </p>
    <p num="157">There exist at least two ways in which inappropriate RAF activity can stimulate unwanted cell proliferation of a particular type of cells: (1) directly stimulating growth of the particular cell, or (2) increasing vascularization of a particular area, such as tumor tissue, thereby facilitating growth of the tissue.</p>
    <p num="158">
      The use of the present invention is facilitated by first identifying whether the cell proliferation disorder is RAF driven.
      <br/>
      Once such disorders are identified, patients suffering from such a disorder can be identified by analysis of their symptoms using procedures well known to physicians or veterinarians of ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      Such patients can then be treated as described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      Determining whether the cell proliferation disorder is RAF driven may be accomplished by first determining the level of RAF activity occurring in the cell or in a particular location in a patient's body.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case of cancer cells the level of one or more RAF activities may be compared for non-RAF driven cancers and RAF driven cancers.
      <br/>
      If the cancer cells have a higher level of RAF activity than RAF driven cancers, preferably equal to or greater than RAF driven cancers, then they are candidates for treatment using the described RAF-modulating methods and compounds of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      In the case of cell proliferative disorders arising due to unwanted proliferation of non-cancer cells, the level of RAF activity is compared to that level occurring in the general population (e.g., the average level occurring in the general population of people or animals excluding those people or animals suffering from a cell proliferative disorder).
      <br/>
      If the unwanted cell proliferation disorder is characterized by a higher RAF level than occurring in the general population then the disorder is a candidate for treatment using the described RAF modulating methods and compounds of the invention.

    <p num="162">
      Methods of preparing pharmaceutical formulations of the compounds, methods of determining the amounts of compounds to be administered to a patient, and modes of administering compounds to an organism are disclosed in PCT WO98/07695 A1 by Tang et al., and entitled "Indolinone Combinatorial Libraries and Related Products and Methods for the Treatment of Disease," (Lyon &amp; Lyon Docket No. 221/187), filed Aug. 23, 1996, and International patent publication number WO 96/22976, by Buzzetti et al., and entitled "Hydrosoluble 3-Arylidene-2-Oxindole Derivatives as Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors," published Aug. 1, 1996, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, including any drawings.
