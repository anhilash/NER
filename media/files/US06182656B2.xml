      An artificial respirator employs rotating chambers to modulate pressure from a unidirectional fluid source.
      <br/>
      The chambers are defined by a core rotating in a shell.
      <br/>
      The core includes an internal divider and a back wall.
      <br/>
      The core also includes a shaft coupled to a motor.
      <br/>
      The motor is mounted on the shell via screws.

      <br/>
      No. 60/065,795 of Ovadia Sagiv filed Nov. 14, 1997 for DEVICE ENABLING TO TRANSFORM A CONSTANT AND UNIDIRECTIONAL FLOW TO AN OSCILLATING FLOW, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates generally to control of fluid flow from a unidirectional source and, more particularly, to control of air pressure in a respirator employing a unidirectional air pressure source.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Artificial respirators are known.
      <br/>
      One type of respirator induces breathing by forcing pressurized air down the patient's trachea, using an intubation tube.
      <br/>
      Although intubation is commonly employed, intubation tends to be traumatic.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Another type of respirator induces breathing by varying air pressure outside the patient's chest, while leaving the patient's mouth and nose at ambient pressure.
      <br/>
      Decades ago, this type of respirator was known as an "Iron Lung" and employed a tank in which the entire body except the head was enclosed.
      <br/>
      Since then, more portable and generally practical devices have been proposed.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,621,621 discloses a respirator jacket assembly, a source of vacuum pressure, and a valve assembly.
      <br/>
      A motor, shaft, lifter, and rocker arm cooperate to move a movable conduit to be coaxial with a fixed conduit, to put the jacket assembly in fluid communication with the vacuum source, thereby creating a negative pressure around the torso of the user, causing air to rush into the lungs.
      <br/>
      When the movable conduit is in the displaced position, the pressure within the jacket returns to ambient pressure, thereby permitting the user to exhale.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,930,498 purports to disclose a ventilator having valve that may be used to provide alternately low and high pressures.
      <br/>
      This valve is connected to separate sources of gas pressure and vacuum.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,982,735 discloses a system including a blower that supplies alternately negative and positive pressure to a dome attached to the chest of the patient.
      <br/>
      The blower is part of a circuit including an air suction valve, an air exertion valve, a release valve, two bypass valves, a negative pressure regulator, and a positive pressure regulator.
    </p>
    <p num="8">These prior systems may be characterized by either a lack of versatility or a complex construction.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">It is an object of the present invention to provide a versatile pressure control mechanism that may employ a relatively simple pressure source in a respirator.</p>
    <p num="10">To achieve this and other objects of the present invention, in a system including a compartment and a person in contact with the compartment having an interior, an artificial respiration system comprises a device for moving fluid, the device including a fluid exit port and a fluid entrance port; a first housing defining a first hole in communication with the exit port, a second hole in communication with the interior of the compartment, a third hole in communication with the entrance port, and a fourth hole; a second housing in the first housing, the second housing defining a first chamber with a first hole, and a second hole, and a second chamber with a third hole, and a fourth hole; a driver for varying the angular displacement of the second housing relative to the first housing; a user interface for generating a first signal indicating a first pressure, a second signal indicating a second pressure, and a third signal indicating a period; and a controller that generates a driver control signal to effect a first angular displacement of the second housing depending on the first signal, and to effect a second angular displacement of the second housing depending on the second signal.</p>
    <p num="11">
      According to another aspect of the present invention, there is a method for a system including a compartment and a person in contact with the compartment having an interior, a device for moving fluid, the device including a fluid exit port and a fluid entrance port; a first housing defining a first hole in communication with the exit port, a second hole in communication with the interior of the compartment, a third hole in communication with the entrance port, and a fourth hole; and a first cell with a first hole, and a second hole.
      <br/>
      The method comprises generating a first signal indicating a first pressure, a second signal indicating a second pressure, and a third signal indicating a period; generating a control signal to effect a first angular displacement of the first cell, relative to the first housing, depending on the first signal, and to effect a second angular displacement of the first cell depending on the second signal; and rotating the first cell in response to the control signal.

      As shown in FIG. 6B, an angle of 90 (degree)  is defined by a line 91 normal to hole 81 and a line 92 normal to hole 82.

    <p num="31">
      Further, lines 92 and 93 also define a 90 (degree)  angle; shell hole 61 is perpendicular to shell hole 62, and core hole 82 is perpendicular to core hole 83.
      <br/>
      Lines 91 and 94 define a 90 (degree)  angle; shell hole 64 is perpendicular to shell hole 63, and core hole 81 is perpendicular to core hole 84.
    </p>
    <p num="32">When core 80 is rotatably mounted inside shell 60, holes 81, 82, 83, and 84 of core 80 may overlap holes 61, 62, 63, 64, respectively, of Shell 60, as shown in FIG. 6B.</p>
    <p num="33">Core's (and Shell's) four round holes diameter (d) are made to fit their common contact diameter (D) to achieve either positive flow or suction (never together), because D &gt;= d (core)/sin ( PI /8), where D is the external diameter of the core and d (core) is the diameter of each of holes 81, 82, 83, and 84.</p>
    <p num="34">Further d (core)  &gt;= d (shell), so that each angular displacement of core 80, relative to shell 60, tends results in a different amount of overlap between holes 81, 82, 83, 84, and holes 61, 62, 63, 64.</p>
    <p num="35">In the exemplary system, D is approximately 80 mm, d(core) is approximately 25 mm, and d(shell) is approximately 25 mm.</p>
    <p num="36">Thus, the size of all four "effective" passages is controlled by this arrangement in core 80 where a pair of perpendicular round holes is leading to each of its two chambers, enabling a complete balanced cycle every 90 (degree) , to control pressure and/or flow for all four passages by the amount of overlap between core's and shell's holes.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Further, this arrangement ensures that, regardless of the current angular displacement of core 80, the effective passages in chamber 85 will have a common size, and the two effective passages in chamber 86 will have a common size, helping to suppress noise and whistles that might exist if the effective passages had different sizes.
      <br/>
      In other words, the four effective passage ways will vary in size.
      <br/>
      Further, the four effective passageways will have a common size at any particular point in time.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In summary, using the relationship of holes 61, 62, 63, and 64 to holes 81, 82, 83, 84, respectively as an example, an extent of overlap of hole 81 with hole 61 is a first function of the angular displacement of core 80, and an extent of overlap of hole 82 with hole 62 is the first function.
      <br/>
      In other words, any effective passage way created by an overlap of holes 81 and 61 will have these same size, at a certain point in time, as any passageway created by overlap of holes 82 and 62.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Further, an extent of overlap of hole 83 with hole 63 is a second function of the angular displacement of the core 80, and an extent of overlap of hole 84 with hole 64.
      <br/>
      In other words, any effective passage way created by an overlap of holes 83 and 63 will have the same size, at a certain point in time, as the passageway created by an overlap of holes 84 and 64.
    </p>
    <p num="40">Further, the first and second functions are substantially the same, meaning that the common pair of passageway size (resulting from the hole 81-61 and hole 82-62 overlap) will also be common with the common passageway size effected by the hole 83-62 overlap and the hole 84-64 overlap.</p>

      Controller 100 receives various input signals from keyboard 30.

      These signals include a respiration frequency 102, and inspiration time to expiration time ratio 104, an inspiration pressure 106, and an expiration pressure 110.
      <br/>
      Pressure sensor 7 generates signal 101, indicating an actual pressure inside compartment 6.
      <br/>
      In response to signals 101, 102, 104, 106, and 110, controller 100 generates motor control signal 112 to cause motor 46 to rotate, and motor control signal 114 to control direction of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise).

      Responsive to signals 112 and 114, motor 46 turns core 80 relative to shell 60.

      Both the pressure effected to induce expiration (PE), and the pressure effected to induce inspiration (PI), may be controlled by controller 100's changing the speed (output) of blower 40 and the angular displacement of core 80.

      The total period (T) of the preferred system is composed of Exp time (tE) and Insp time (tI).
    </p>
    <p num="44">Because of the size and position of holes 81, 82, 83, and 84, of core 80, compartment 6 receives either positive flow or suction (never together), in an amount depending on the time that holes 81, 82, 83, 84 coincide with holes 61, 62, 63, and 64.</p>

      One side (exit or entrance at each half cycle) of blower 40 may be properly vented to the ambient medium, in order not to block its operation and ensuring the constant flow.

      FIG. 8 shows some angular displacements in the preferred system.

      At a time t0, controller 100 sets the angular displacement to -45 (degree)  as shown in FIG. 6B. After waiting for an interval tI at time t1 controller 100 generates pulses in motor control signal 112, to set the angular displacement to 0 (degree)  as shown in FIG. 6A and at a time t2 controller 100 generates pulses in motor control signal 112, to set the angular displacement the current value of  varies as E. The first time through the loop,  varies as E will be 45 (degree)  as shown in FIG. 6C. In this example, 45 (degree)  results in a pressure that is more than the programmed expiration pressure at which time controller 100 decreases the angular displacement by 0.9 at a time t4.
      <br/>
      After waiting for the interval tE, at time t5 controller 100 generates pulses in motor control signal 112, to set the angle to 0 (degree) , and at t6 generates pulses in motor control signal 112, to set to an angle of -45 (degree) .
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The actual pressure is still greater than the programmed expiration pressure and at t7 controller 100 again generates pulses in motor control signal 112, to reduce the angular displacement by 0.9. The expiration pressure is now equal to the programmed expiration pressure.
      <br/>
      In other words, the angle of 43.2 (degree)  shown in FIG. 6D results in the appropriate passage way size to achieve this programmed expiration pressure.
