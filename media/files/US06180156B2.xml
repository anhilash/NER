      In particular, the N-alkylated aspartame derivative, N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, is known as an extremely potent sweetening agent since its sweetening potency, on a weight basis, has been reported to be at least 50 times that of aspartame and about 10,000 times that of sucrose.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Since sweetening agents are often employed in aqueous solutions and beverages, it is important that they have an acceptable dissolution rate and an effective level of solubility to be commercially practicable. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,029,701 and 4,031,258 describe inorganic salts of dipeptides that provide improved solubility in aqueous solution while maintaining the sweet property of the dipeptide. U.S. Pat. No. 4,448,716 describes certain dipeptide sweetener-metal complexes that provide improved dissolution and solubility. U.S. Pat. No. 4,153,737 describes concentrated solutions of dipeptide salts in a non-aqueous system (concentrated liquid low calorie sweetener). N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethyl-butyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, however, is not disclosed or suggested.</p>
    <p num="7">Structurally, N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester and aspartame differ in that, in N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, a bulky neohexyl substituent is present on the amine nitrogen.  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="8">
      This structural difference results in dramatic differences in the physical and chemical properties of these compounds.
      <br/>
      For example, the melting point of N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester is 80 (degree)  C., while that of aspartame is 248 (degree)  C. In addition, N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester has much higher solubility in organic solvents than aspartame, and a much lower solubility in water.
      <br/>
      It is also known that N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester has a higher stability than aspartame under some pH conditions, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,480,688. The pronounced difference in sweetness between the two compounds is further evidence of their chemical dissimilarity.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Moreover, it is also known that a primary amino group such as the one on aspartame (pKa 7.7) generally has a different pKa than those from a secondary amino group such as the one on N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester (pKa 8.1).
      <br/>
      Moreover, the pKa's of an amino acid are known to have a profound impact on food applications (Labuza, T. P. and Basisier, M. W., 1992, "Physical Chemistry of Foods", H. G. Schwartzber and R. W. Hartel (Eds.), Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York).
      <br/>
      It is also well known that a secondary amine group can not form Schiff base type compounds with carbonyl compounds while a primary amine may.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester exhibits physiologically different behavior than aspartame as exemplified by the dramatic difference in sweetness.
      <br/>
      These differences are clearly indicative that the characteristics and properties of one can not be said to suggest those of the other.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      While N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester is a highly potent sweetener, it is sparingly soluble in water and can give rise to dusting problems.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a need for N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester derivatives that have good dissolution and solubility properties in aqueous systems, and avoid dusting problems often encountered with fine powders.

      <br/>
      The invention is also related to a liquid low calorie sweetener containing the acid salts of this invention.

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading>
    <p num="13">The FIGURE is a graph comparing the aqueous dissolution of N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester at a target concentration of 0.05% by weight with equivalent neotame concentrations, i.e., the concentration of the neotame delivered in each case is the same, of the phosphate and citrate salts of N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      This invention is directed to salts of N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, i.e., salts of neotame. U.S. Pat. No. 5,480,668, U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,508 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,862, which describe the preparation of N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester are incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth.
      <br/>
      Thus, the starting material may be readily prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The acid salts of this invention may be prepared by first slurrying the N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester in a solvent or mixture of solvents.
      <br/>
      Exemplary solvents may include water, methanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran and the like.
      <br/>
      The slurry is stirred and an equimolar amount of the desired acid is slowly added to dissolve the N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester and form the salt of this invention.
      <br/>
      The salt may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent, freeze drying or spray drying the resulting solution.
      <br/>
      The order of the addition of sweetener to acid has not been found to be of consequence and can be readily determined by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Acid salts of N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester prepared under these conditions do not show any racemization.
      <br/>
      Addition of excess of acid (more than 1 equivalent) does cause hydrolysis of the methyl ester.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The acids employed in the preparation of the salts of this invention are typically selected from compounds that have a pKa effectively lower than the pKa of the secondary amine of N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester to result in the formation of the desired salt.
      <br/>
      Such compounds include, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, gluconic acid and carbonic acid.
      <br/>
      As such, X- is a physiologically acceptable anion selected from the group consisting of Cl-, HSO4-, H2 PO3-, citrate-, HCO3-, furmarate, malate, maleiate, tartarate, acetate, benzoate or gluconate.
      <br/>
      These ions can be used alone or in combination.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Particularly preferred salts of this invention include the hydrochloride, phosphate, sulfate, citrate, hydrobromide and carbonic salts of N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-1-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester.</p>
    <p num="18">
      It is believed that the acid salts of this invention provide a number of improved properties over those of N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester.
      <br/>
      In particular, the aqueous solubility is increased and the dissolution rate of the composition is greatly improved.
      <br/>
      These acidic salts of neotame are sweet and it is also believed that these salts have improved taste.
      <br/>
      Thus, these salts of N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester will be particularly useful in beverage systems, particularly since additional methods or mechanical preparations are diminished or not necessary to provide for quick dissolution such as desired in a table top sweetener.
      <br/>
      The salts of this invention may be admixed with known bulking agents to prepare tablets, powdered or granular sweetener using methods well known to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      These salts may also be used to prepare a liquid, low-calorie sweetener by dissolving a high concentration of the salt of this invention in an aqueous or alcoholic system, e.g., water, ethanol, water/ethanol, propylene glycol or propylene glycol/water.
      <br/>
      Such a liquid, low-calorie sweetener may find utility in such foodstuffs as gelatin desserts, fruit flavored beverages, cereal, cake mixes, fruit juices, syrups, salad dressings, pet foods, carbonated soft drinks, table top sweeteners and the like.
      <br/>
      Such utilities are not restrictive since other applications may include cough medicines, tonics and the like.
      <br/>
      One embodiment of this invention of particular interest contemplates a liquid table top sweetener as a replacement for sucrose and other known sweeteners.
      <br/>
      The liquid low calorie sweetener generally will contain up to about 40% by weight of the salt of N-ï¿½N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- ALPHA -aspartylï¿½-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, the concentration depending of course on the desired end use.
