      <br/>
      A transparent vessel containing a fluid and a life-like full scale human brain inserted into the fluid is used for novelty purposes.
      <br/>
      The vessel is open on its top and sealed on its bottom, and is mounted on a base portion of the device.
      <br/>
      Air bubbles are produced from an air pump attached to the side of the base portion.
      <br/>
      A tube connected to the air pump and an outlet port is positioned inside of the vessel, immersed in the liquid to supply air.
      <br/>
      The transparent, water-tight brain vessel is lit from underneath by a lamp.
      <br/>
      To enhance an effect of a scientific fiction experiment, the novelty is placed on a stand and has one or more decorative perforated tubes attached for visual effect.
      <br/>
      The tank is preferably covered with a dome-shaped lid.

      Murray, Jr., U.S. Pat. No. 5,313,727 describes a decorative kinetic device which includes a transparent hollow dome containing a fluid and a plurality of small particles.
      <br/>
      The dome is open on its bottom and is mounted on a base having a pumping chamber formed therein.
      <br/>
      The top of the pumping chamber, which serves as the bottom of the dome, includes an intake hole and an outlet hole to provide flow paths between the dome and the pumping chamber.
      <br/>
      A pump impeller is positioned within the pumping chamber to circulate the fluid and the particles, the impeller being rotated by a motor positioned in the base below the pumping chamber.
      <br/>
      An extension member is attached to and extends vertically upward from the pump impeller into the dome and is adapted to receive a decorative object.
      <br/>
      A transport tube having an intake port and an outlet port is positioned in the dome such that the intake port is connected to the outlet hole of the pumping chamber and the outlet port of the transporting tube is positioned near the top of the dome.
      <br/>
      Rotation of the impeller causes the fluid and the particles to be drawn through and out of the pumping chamber into and through the transport tube, out of the transport tube near the top of the dome and down through the dome to the pumping chamber again.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously, the rotating extension member is caused to rotate.

      A pedestal supports the display tube and includes a light-transmitting top plate on which the base of the display tube is seated.
      <br/>
      An impeller within the display tube rotates the liquid within the tube.
      <br/>
      The pedestal contains a reversible motor for driving the impeller, lights for lighting the contents of the display tube through the light-transmitting base and top plate, and air pumps for forcing air into the liquid within the display tube.

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading>
    <p num="17">
      The accompanying drawing illustrates the present invention. In this drawing:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the present invention.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">
      The above-described drawing figures illustrate the invention, a novelty apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a perspective view illustrating the present invention.
      <br/>
      The apparatus 10 comprises a stand 11 providing a tank support base 12 made of wood, steel, aluminum, plastic or other structural material, and an air pump 13.
      <br/>
      The base 12 includes an outer 22 and an inner 23 concentric annular skirts which are connected by a horizontal top annular surface 24.
      <br/>
      Horizontal top annular surface 24 extends inwardly from the outer skirt 22 to the inner skirt 23 and forms with the inner skirt 23 an opening 25 in the center of the base 12.
      <br/>
      A transparent water tank 14 is received by the opening 25 formed by the inner annular skirt 23 of the base 12 and is positioned for viewing an interior of the water tank 14.
      <br/>
      The water tank 14, made of glass or plastic, has an open top and a closed bottom and is filled with water.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the water tank 14 is filled with other clear or colored fluid.
      <br/>
      The air pump 13 is supported by the outer annular skirt 22 of the base 12 and is attached to the outer annular skirt by a suitable means, such as a screw or any other fastening means.
      <br/>
      An air hose 15, engaged with the air pump 13, delivers air into the transparent water tank 14 to create a continuous bubbling effect.
      <br/>
      A replica of a human brain 16 made of rubber, plastic or other suitable material is positioned within the water tank 14 through the open top thereof and is supported therein by a brain supporting means, such as plastic tubing 17 to suggest the appearance of a science fiction experiment.
      <br/>
      A lamp enclosure 18 made of steel, aluminum, plastic or other structural material, is engaged with the tank support base 12 and positioned to direct a light beam 26 through opening 25 into the water tank 14 for creating a lighting effect therein.
      <br/>
      The light beam 26 is produced by various lighting means suitable for such effect when placed within the lamp enclosure 18.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The combination of the tank support base 12, air pumpl3, water tank 14, air hose 15, brain replica 16, and lamp enclosure 18 creates an amusement effect suggesting the appearance of a science fiction experiment.
      <br/>
      Additionally, it may have a soothing effect from bubbling sounds and the view of the moving water.
      <br/>
      The water tank may also be used as a fish tank.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Additionally, the invention to additionally includes a set of legs 19 for mounting the water tank base 12 and for supporting it in an elevated position.</p>
    <p num="21">Additionally, the invention further comprises a flexible hose 20 extending from an exterior surface 22 of the lamp enclosure 23 to an exterior surface 24 of the water tank 14 for further suggesting a science fiction experiment.</p>
    <p num="22">The invention further includes a dome shaped water tank cover 21 adapted for covering the open top 27 of the water tank 14 for aesthetic purposes, to direct and support the various tubes of the invention, and to enhance the appearance of the invention.</p>
    <p num="23">
      While the invention has been described with reference to at least one preferred embodiment, it is to be clearly understood by those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited thereto.
      <br/>
      Rather, the scope of the invention is to be interpreted only in conjunction with the appended claims.
