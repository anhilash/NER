      A process for producing packaged products from a film roll includes the steps of detecting whether an elongate film is defective or not, detecting whether a spool is defective or not, detecting whether an assembled cartridge is defective or not, and detecting whether a case is defective or not.
      <br/>
      Various defective products detected in these steps are removed without being fed to subsequent steps.
      <br/>
      By thus detecting various defects in the process for producing packaged products from a film roll, high-quality packaged products can efficiently be manufactured.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a method of and a system for winding a film of given length, cut from a film roll, winding the film on a spool, placing the wound film into a film cartridge, and inserting the film cartridge into a case, thereby to manufacture a packaged product.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">For producing and packaging a photographic photosensitive film, it has been customary to perform various steps including the steps of producing a film of given length, winding the film, placing the wound film into a film cartridge, and inserting the film cartridge into a case.</p>
    <p num="6">These various steps are carried out by a station comprising a film supply unit for unwinding a film roll and cutting the unwound film to a film of given length, a film coiling unit for coiling the film of given length on a spool thereby to produce a film coil, a cartridge producing unit for staking a cap on an end of a tubular cartridge blank sheet thereby to produce a cartridge with one open end, an assembling unit for inserting the film coil into the cartridge and staking another cap on the open end of the cartridge thereby to produce an assembled cartridge, and an encasing unit for placing the assembled cartridge into a case and attaching a case cap on an open end of the case thereby to produce a packaged product.</p>
    <p num="7">
      As described above, the various steps are carried out by the above station in order to manufacture packaged products from a film roll.
      <br/>
      However, the station effects no defect inspection in each of the manufacturing steps.
      <br/>
      If something defective is produced in any one of the steps, it is delivered successively through the subsequent steps, resulting in an increased ratio of defective packaged products.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it is not possible to carry out an efficient process of manufacturing packaged products, and high-quality packaged products cannot be manufactured efficiently.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      According to one solution disclosed in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 6-266059, photosensitive film magazines are successively supplied from a photosensitive film magazine assembling unit through a predetermined path covered with a light shield tunnel that extends over a distance required to place the photosensitive film magazine assembling unit essentially in a dark room condition.
      <br/>
      The supplied photosensitive film magazines are inspected one by one in a non-dark room condition, and then supplied successively through a given path to a container storing unit.
      <br/>
      In the container storing unit, only those photosensitive film magazines which are judged as accepted by the inspection process are stored in a photosensitive film magazine container.
    </p>
    <p num="9">In the above disclosed process, since photosensitive film magazines are inspected in a non-dark room condition, if something defective occurs prior to the production of a cartridge in the cartridge producing unit, e.g., if a defective film coil is produced by the film coiling unit in a dark room, it is not possible to inspect the defective film coil.</p>
    <p num="10">
      When the defective film coil is introduced into the cartridge producing unit, operation of the cartridge producing unit may be interrupted because the defective film coil may not be inserted into a cartridge, or if the defective film coil is inserted into a cartridge, then a ratio of defective assembled cartridges is increased.
      <br/>
      Since the cartridges are considerably expensive, the production of many defective assembled cartridges is uneconomical because they are usually thrown away.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The film coiling unit includes a spool supply unit which contains a predetermined number of spools.
      <br/>
      After the spools are successively discharged from the spool supply unit, new spools are automatically supplied to the film coiling unit by a feeder such as a conveyor or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Spools are made of synthetic resin, and have thin-walled large-diameter tubular members on opposite axial ends thereof.
      <br/>
      Inasmuch as a thin-walled large-diameter tubular member tends to be cracked or broken with ease, a spool with a defective large-diameter tubular member may be delivered to the film coiling unit.
      <br/>
      When a film of given length is wound on such a spool with a defective large-diameter tubular member, a defective film coil is produced.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the yield of accepted packaged products cannot be increased, and an efficient and economical process of producing and packaging films cannot be carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      A case for accommodating an assembled cartridge therein is usually in the form of a bottomed cylindrical case molded of synthetic resin.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the case is liable to be flexed or otherwise deformed.
      <br/>
      When an assembled cartridge is placed in a deformed case, a defective packaged product results.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 4-217511 discloses a pipeline transportation system including an aligning container for controlling the orientation of cylindrical bodies (cases) accommodated therein, a sorter for drawing and sorting out cylindrical bodies, and a transportation pipe smoothly joined to the sorter for delivering under suction those sorted-out cylindrical bodies which have a normal shape.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The sorter is positioned at a suction port of the aligning container, and is constricted into a diameter smaller than the inside diameter of the transportation pipe and slightly greater than the outside diameter of cylindrical bodies.
      <br/>
      When a deformed cylindrical body is sent to the suction port of the aligning container, the deformed cylindrical body is prevented from entering the transportation pipe by the sorter.
      <br/>
      However, because the deformed cylindrical body which is blocked by the sorter remained undelivered in the sorter, subsequent normal cylindrical bodies cannot smoothly be delivered into the transportation pipe.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, the pipeline transportation system is apt to suffer a cylindrical body delivery failure.

      <br/>
      The openable and closable guide 124 is retractable out of the film feed path.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, a discharge receptacle 136 of the defective film discharger 43a is disposed below the openable and closable guide 124 for discharging a defective film.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      As shown in FIGS. 4 and 6, the discharge receptacle 136 is movable into and out of the film feed path in directions perpendicular to the sheet of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The discharge receptacle 136 is connected to an end of a discharge chute 138 in the form of a pipe of a synthetic resin such as vinyl chloride, for example.
      <br/>
      The other end of the discharge chute 138 extends from the dark room 44 into the bright room 45 where it communicates with an accumulation chamber 142 (see FIG. 6) within a discharge box 140.

Specifically, the confronting pairs of infrared photosensors comprise an upper pair of first and second light-emitting elements 156a, 158a for emitting respective rays of infrared radiation and a lower pair of first and second light-detecting elements 156b, 158b for detecting the respective rays of infrared radiation emitted from the first and second light-emitting elements 156a, 158a.</p>
    <p num="39">The first and second light-emitting elements 156a, 158a, which are positioned above the path S, are spaced a given distance from an end face (end face of the trailing end 16c) 159 where the elongate film F is to be cut off by the cutter 80, and also spaced a predetermined distance from the first and second light-detecting elements 156b, 158b, which are positioned below the path S. If the elongate film F is positioned accurately with respect to the cutter 80, then inspecting rays (infrared radiation) emitted from the respective first and second light-emitting elements 156a, 158a pass through respective perforations 74 to the respective first and second light-detecting elements 156b, 158b, which then issue respective ON signals.</p>
    <p num="40">
      The first and second light-detecting elements 156b, 158b are electrically connected to a decision unit 161.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The winding length abnormality detector 185 operates before and after a sized film 16 is wound in the winding station ST5.
      <br/>
      Specifically, before a sized film 16 is wound in the winding station ST5, the winding length abnormality detector 185 decides whether the trailing end 16c of the sized film 16 has a sufficient length, i.e., whether the trailing end 16c is properly introduced in the guide 187.
      <br/>
      After a sized film 16 is wound in the winding station ST5, the winding length abnormality detector 185 detects whether the trailing end 16c of the sized film 16 has been wound to a desired length.

The pressure of the air ejected from the air nozzle 416 is set to 0.01 (kgf/cm2 G).
      <br/>
      Consequently, the difference between the air pressure detected by the pressure sensor 418 when a normal spool 20 is inspected and the air pressure detected by the pressure sensor 418 when a spool 20 with a defective large-diameter flange 398a or 398b is inspected is large enough to inspect spools 20 reliably with the accuracy of the resolution of the pressure sensor 418.

      If the inspected spool 20 is judged as normal, then the spool 20 is supplied from the first tube 492 of the feed path switching mechanism 424 into the first feed path 420.

      The normal spool 20 is then fed through the first feed path 420 to the film coiling unit 22.

      As shown in FIG. 29, a plurality of cases 38 are filled in the hopper 508 in the case supply unit 56.

      A predetermined number of cases 38 are supplied from the hopper 508 to the bucket 512, which is then lifted along the parts lifter 510 to supply the cases 38 to the aligning feeder 514.
      <br/>
      The aligning feeder 514 is actuated to deliver the cases 38 successively onto the feed path 516, from which the cases 38 are delivered to the discharging device 515 (see also FIG. 30).

      In the discharging device 515, as shown in FIGS. 31 and 32, the passage member 530 is disposed in the feed position P1.

      <br/>
      The through hole 528 includes the deformed case engaging surface 534 tapered in the direction indicated by the arrow K. The diameter d2 of the exist region of the deformed case engaging surface 534 is slightly greater than the outside diameter of the cases 38.

      In the film producing and packaging system 10, various defective products produced after an elongate film F is unwound from a film roll 14 until packaged products 12 are manufactured are individually discharged without being processed in subsequent processes.
      <br/>
      Specifically, a support film base is coated with a photosensitive layer to produce a blank film before a film roll is produced from the blank film and processed by the film producing and packaging system 10.
      <br/>
      Information about defective regions on the blank film which are caused by the process of applying the photosensitive layer is stored in the computer 570.

    <p num="160">
      When a defective region of the film roll 14 unwound by the feeder 70 is fed to the cutter 80 and a leading end of the defective region is cut by the cutter 80, the openable and closable guide 124 is displaced away from the film feed path, and the discharge receptacle 136 of the defective film discharger 43a is moved over the film feed path.
      <br/>
      Then, when the air blower 146 (FIG. 6) is actuated, a defective film Fa is attracted by the discharge receptacle 136 with the entire length of the defective region being continuously attracted, and the trailing end of the defective region is cut off by the cutter 80.

      The defective film Fa is now drawn through the discharge chute 138 into the accumulation chamber 142 in the discharge box 140.

      In the film coiling unit 22, the sized film 16 may not sufficiently be wound on the spool 20, resulting in a defective film coil 32a.
      <br/>
      When such a defective film coil 32a is produced, as shown in FIG. 10, the defective film coil 32a is discharged into the discharge chute 204 of the defective film roll discharger 43b positioned near the second transfer unit 190.

      The cap height and torque detecting station ST9a on the index table 202 detects the resistance to the pulling of the trailing end 16c of the sized film 16 that projects from the assembled cartridge 34, detects the height of the assembled cartridge 34, detects the length of the trailing end 16c, and detects whether there is a cap 26b or not.
      <br/>
      When an assembled cartridge 34a judged as defective based on the detected results is fed to the second feed path 48, since the cartridge loading unit 328 is not operated, the defective assembled cartridge 34a is discharged into the discharge chute 324 of the defective cartridge discharger 43c.

      Accordingly, the defective assembled cartridge 34a will not be delivered to the encasing unit 42.
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      In the encasing unit 42, an assembled cartridge 34 may not be reliably loaded into a case 38.

      When this happens, no case cap 40 is mounted on a defective case 38a in the case cap inserting station ST5b, and the defective case 38a is delivered to the defective packaged product discharging station ST8b.
      <br/>
      Then, the defective case 38a with the assembled cartridge 34 accommodated therein is discharged into the discharge chute 344 of the defective case discharger 43d, and will not be delivered to the conveyor 62.

      Therefore, various defective products can be detected after an elongate film F is unwound from a film roll 14 until packaged products 12 are manufactured, and will not be processed in subsequent processes.

      The film position detector 150 can detect whether perforations 74 are positionally displaced or not to prevent the end face 159 of the sized film 16 from lying over perforations 74.
      <br/>
      If perforations 74 are positionally displaced, then a film feed system makes positional adjustments to correct the perforations 74 out of the positional displacement.
      <br/>
      The full length detector 152 ensures that a sized film 16 is cut to a desired length, and the splicing detector 154 functions to prevent a splicing tape 86 from existing in a sized film 16.

      Therefore, it is possible to manufacture high-quality packaged products efficiently.

    <p num="169">
      In this embodiment, since various defective products are individually discharged without being processed in subsequent processes, these defective products are prevented from being delivered to subsequent processes and hence from being undesirably processed.

      A defective film coil 32a is not fed to the index table 202 of the assembling unit 36.

      In the film producing and packaging system 10 according to the above embodiment, a predetermined number of sample products 12a for each film roll 14 are periodically extracted.

      Furthermore, if it is necessary to extract a sample product 12a because of a failure or maintenance of the film producing and packaging system 10, then the computer 570 instructs the film producing and packaging system 10 to extract a sample product 12a.
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      The operator may operate the control console 66 to extract a sample product 12a from each of certain blocks.

      These blocks may comprise the film supply unit 18, the film coiling unit 22, and the assembling unit 36, or may comprise smaller components including the turntable 172, the first transfer unit 188, and the second transfer unit 190.
      <br/>
      The operator may designate a sized film 16 existing in either one of these blocks to remove a packaged product 12 which contains the designated sized film 16 as a sample product 12a, and place the sample product 12a into the sample product accumulating unit 341.
    </p>
    <p num="173">Accordingly, it is possible to extract any desired packaged product 12 easily and reliably as a sample product 12a, for inspecting how defective a sized film 16 recognized as a defective film is, for example.</p>
    <p num="174">Furthermore, spools 20 fed by the belt conveyor 405 in the direction indicated by the arrow E are delivered one at a time by the spool introducing mechanism 406, and dropped into the tube 404 with the shorter end 396b facing downwardly (forwardly) by the spool orienting mechanism 408.</p>
    <p num="175">Then, while the spool 20 is being held in the inspecting station 410 by the holder mechanism 412, air is introduced into the space 414 defined between the large-diameter flanges 398a, 398b of the spool 20 and the inner wall surface 404a of the tube 404, and the air pressure in the space 414 is detected by the pressure sensor 418 to detect whether the large-diameter flanges 398a, 398b are defective or not.</p>
    <p num="176">
      Therefore, each of the spools 20 that are successively fed from the spool supply unit 50 can quickly and accurately be inspected for defects, making it possible to prevent defective spools 20 from being delivered to the film coiling unit 22 and hence to prevent defective packaged products 14 from being manufactured.

      Consequently, the rate of defective packaged products 14 is effectively reduced.

      In this embodiment, moreover, a spool 20 judged as accepted in the inspecting station 410 is delivered from the first tube 492 through the first feed path 420 to the film coiling unit 22, and a spool 20 judged as defective in the inspecting station 410 is automatically discharged from the second tube 494, which is positioned below the block 460 by the feed path switching mechanism 424, through the second feed path 422 to the discharging position.

      If the case 38 is judged as an undeformed case 38, then it is fed through the through hole 528 in the passage member 530 and delivered from the second tube 556 to the encasing unit 42.
      <br/>
      If the case 38 is judged as a deformed case 38a, then it is displaced, together with the passage member 530 to the removal position P2, from which the deformed case 38a is automatically delivered into the discharge tube 546 by the transfer mechanism 522.
