    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      A variety of diseases and clinical disorders are treated by the administration of a pharmaceutically active peptide.
      <br/>
      One such example is prostate cancer, which is a sex hormone dependent cancer and which can be treated by administration of a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue that disturbs the production of luteinizing hormone (LH), which regulates the synthesis of male hormones.
      <br/>
      In particular, to decrease LH production, peptidic analogues of LHRH that act as superagonists of the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone receptor, such as leuprolide and goserelin, have been used.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In many instances, the therapeutic effectiveness of a pharmaceutically active peptide depends upon its continued presence in vivo over prolonged time periods.
      <br/>
      To achieve continuous delivery of the peptide in vivo, a sustained release or sustained delivery formulation is desirable, to avoid the need for repeated administrations.
      <br/>
      One approach for sustained drug delivery is by microencapsulation, in which the active ingredient is enclosed within a polymeric membrane to produce microparticles.
      <br/>
      For example, LHRH superagonists, such as leuprolide and goserelin, typically are encapsulated within a microparticle comprising a poly-lactide/poly-glycolide copolymer to prepare formulations suitable for depot injection that provide sustained delivery of the superagonist over several weeks to months (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,675,189; 4,677,191; 5,480,656 and 4,728,721).
    </p>
    <p num="4">Additional sustained delivery formulations for administering pharmaceutically active peptides in vivo continuously for prolonged time periods are needed.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a stable water-insoluble complex composed of a peptidic compound (e.g., a peptide, polypeptide, protein, peptidomimetic and the like), preferably a pharmaceutically active peptidic compound, and a carrier macromolecule that allow for sustained delivery of the peptidic compound in vivo upon administration of the complex.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the complex of the invention can permit continuous delivery of a pharmaceutically active peptidic compound to a subject for prolonged periods of time, e.g., one month.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the association of the peptidic compound and the carrier macromolecule in a tight, stable complex allows for loading of high concentrations of the peptidic compound into the formulation.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The complex of the invention is formed by combining the peptidic compound and the carrier macromolecule under conditions such that a substantially water-insoluble complex is formed, e.g., aqueous solutions of the peptidic compound and carrier macromolecule are mixed until the complex precipitates.
      <br/>
      The complex may be in the form of a solid (e.g., a paste, granules, a powder or a lyophilizate) or the powdered form of the complex can be pulverized finely enough to form stable liquid suspensions or semi-solid dispersions.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In a preferred embodiment, the peptidic compound of the water-insoluble complex is an LHRH analogue, more preferably an LHRH antagonist, and the carrier macromolecule is an anionic polymer, preferably carboxymethylcellulose.
      <br/>
      The complex of the invention is suitable for sterilization, such as by gamma irradiation or electron beam irradiation, prior to administration in vivo.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Method for treating a subject for a condition treatable with an LHRH analogue by administering to the subject an LHRH-analogue-containing composition of the invention are also provided.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the treatment methods of the invention are used in the treatment of prostate cancer.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      This invention pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a stable water-insoluble complex composed of a peptidic compound (e.g., a peptide, polypeptide, protein, peptidomimetic and the like) and a carrier macromolecule, methods of making such compositions and methods of using such compositions.
      <br/>
      The advantages of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include the ability for delivery of a pharmaceutically active peptidic compound, either systemically or locally, for prolonged periods (e.g., several weeks, one month or several months) and the ability to load high concentrations of peptidic compound into the complex.
    </p>
    <p num="11">In order that the invention may be more readily understood, certain terms are first defined.</p>
    <p num="12">
      As used herein, the term "peptidic compound" is intended to refer to compounds composed, at least in part, of amino acid residues linked by amide bonds (i.e., peptide bonds).
      <br/>
      The term "peptidic compound" is intended to encompass peptides, polypeptide and proteins.
      <br/>
      Typically, a peptide will be composed of less than about 100 amino acids, more typically less than about 50 amino acid residues and even more typically, less than about 25 amino acid residues.
      <br/>
      The term "peptidic compound" is further intended to encompass peptide analogues, peptide derivatives and peptidomimetics that mimic the chemical structure of a peptide composed of naturally-occurring amino acids.
      <br/>
      Examples of peptide analogues include peptides comprising one or more non-natural amino acids.
      <br/>
      Examples of peptide derivatives include peptides in which an amino acid side chain, the peptide backbone, or the amino- or carboxy-terminus has been derivatized (e.g., peptidic compounds with methylated amide linkages).
      <br/>
      Examples of peptidomimetics include peptidic compounds in which the peptide backbone is substituted with one or more benzodiazepine molecules (see e.g., James, G. L. et al. (1993) Science 260:1937-1942), "inverso" peptides in which all L-amino acids are substituted with the corresponding D-amino acids, "retro-inverso" peptides (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,752 by Sisto) in which the sequence of amino acids is reversed ("retro") and all L-amino acids are replaced with D-amino acids )"inverso") and other isosteres, such as peptide back-bone (i.e., amide bond) mimetics, including modifications of the amide nitrogen, the  ALPHA -carbon, amide carbonyl, complete replacement of the amide bond, extensions, deletions or backbone crosslinks.
      <br/>
      Several peptide backbone modifications are known, including  PSI �CH2 S�,  PSI �CH2 NH�,  PSI �CSNH2 �,  PSI �NHCO�,  PSI �COCH2 �, and  PSI �(E) or (Z) CH.dbd.CH�. In the nomenclature used above,  PSI  indicates the absence of an amide bond.
      <br/>
      The structure that replaces the amide group is specified within the brackets.
      <br/>
      Other possible modifications include an N-alkyl (or aryl) substitution ( PSI �CONR�), backbone crosslinking to construct lactams and other cyclic structures, and other derivatives including C-terminal hydroxymethyl derivatives, O-modified derivatives and N-terminally modified derivatives including substituted amides such as alkylamides and hydrazides.
    </p>
    <p num="13">As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically active peptidic compound" is intended to refer to a peptidic compound that exhibits pharmacologic activity, either in its present form or upon processing in vivo (i.e., pharmaceutically active peptidic compounds include peptidic compounds with constitutive pharmacologic activity and peptidic compounds in a "prodrug" form that have to be metabolized or processed in some way in vivo following administration in order to exhibit pharmacologic activity).</p>
    <p num="14">
      As used herein, the terms "multivalent cationic peptidic compound" and "multivalent anionic peptidic compound" are intended to refer to peptidic compounds comprising a multiplicity of positive or negative charges, respectively.
      <br/>
      A "bivalent cationic" or "bivalent anionic" peptidic compound is intended to refer to a peptidic compound comprising two positive or negative charges, respectively.
      <br/>
      A "trivalent cationic" or "trivalent anionic" peptidic compound is intended to refer to a peptidic compound comprising three positive or negative charges, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      As used herein, the term "LHRH analogue" is intended to encompass peptidic compounds that mimic the structure of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone.
      <br/>
      An LHRH analogue may be an LHRH agonist or an LHRH antagonist.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As used herein, an "LHRH agonist" is intended to refer to a compound which stimulates the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone receptor (LHRH-R) such that release of luteinizing hormone is stimulated, or an "LHRH antagonist", which refers to a compound that inhibits LHRH-R such that release of luteinizing hormone is inhibited.
      <br/>
      Examples of LHRH agonists include leuprolide (trade name: Lupron.RTM.; Abbott/TAP), goserelin (trade name: Zoladex.RTM.; Zeneca), buserelin (Hoechst), triptorelin (also known as Decapeptyl, D-Trp-6-LHRH and Debiopharm.RTM.; Ipsen/Beaufour), nafarelin (trade name" Synarel.RTM.; Syntex), lutrelin (Wyeth), cystorelin (Hoechst), gonadorelin (Ayerst) and histrelin (Ortho).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      As used herein, the term "LHRH antagonist" is intended to refer to a compound that inhibits the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone receptor such that release of luteinizing hormone is inhibited.
      <br/>
      Examples of LHRH antagonists include Antide, Cetrorelix, compounds described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,947 to Folkers et al.; PCT Publication No. WO 89/01944 by Folkers et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,413,990 to Haviv; U.S. Pat. No. 5,300,492 to Haviv; U.S Pat. No. 5,371,070 to Koerber et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,296,468 to Hoeger et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,835 to Janaky et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,003,011 to Coy et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,431,635 to Coy; U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,421 to De et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,851,385 to Roeske; U.S. Pat. No. 4,801,577 to Nestor, Jr. et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,396 to Roeske et al. and compounds disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/480,494, entitled "LHRH Antagonist Peptides", and a corresponding PCT application thereof (PCT Application No. PCT/US96/09852), also entitled "LHRH Antagonist Peptides", the entire contents of both of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      An especially preferred LHRH antagonist comprises the structure: Ac-D-Nal1, 4-Cl-D-Phe2, D-Pal3, N-Me-Tyr5, D-Asn6, Lys(iPr)8, D-Ala10 -LHRH, referred to herein as PPI-149.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As used herein, the term "carrier macromolecule" is intended to refer to a macromolecule that can complex with a peptidic compound to form a water-insoluble complex.
      <br/>
      Prior to complexing with the peptidic compound, the carrier macromolecule typically is water-soluble.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the macromolecule has a molecular weight of at least 5 kDa, more preferably 10 kDa.
      <br/>
      The term "anionic carrier macromolecule" is intended to include negatively charged high molecular weight molecules, such as anionic polymers.
      <br/>
      The term "cationic carrier macromolecule" is intended to includes positively charged high molecular weight molecules, such as cationic polymers.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As used herein, the term "water-insoluble complex" is intended to refer to a physically and chemically stable complex that forms upon appropriate combining of a peptidic compound and carrier macromolecule according to procedures described herein.
      <br/>
      This complex typically takes the form of a precipitate that is produced upon combining aqueous preparations of the peptidic compound and carrier macromolecule.
      <br/>
      Although not intending to be limited by mechanism, the formation of preferred water-insoluble complexes of the invention is thought to involve (i.e., be mediated at least in part by) ionic interactions in situations where the peptidic compound is cationic and the carrier molecule is anionic or vice versa.
      <br/>
      Additionally or alternatively, the formation of a water-insoluble complex of the invention may involve (i.e., be mediated at least in part by) hydrophobic interactions.
      <br/>
      Still further, formation of a water-insoluble complex of the invention may involve (i.e., be mediated at least in part by) covalent interactions.
      <br/>
      Description of the complex as being "water-insoluble" is intended to indicate that the complex does not substantially or readily dissolve in water, as indicated by its precipitation from aqueous solution.
      <br/>
      However, it should be understood that a "water-insoluble" complex of the invention may exhibit limited solubility (i.e., partial solubility) in water either in vitro or in the aqueous physiological environment in vivo.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As used herein, the term "sustained delivery" is intended to refer to continual delivery of a pharmaceutical agent in vivo over a period of time following administration, preferably at least several days, a week or several weeks.
      <br/>
      Sustained delivery of the agent can be demonstrated by, for example, the continued therapeutic effect of the agent over time (e.g., for an LHRH analogue, sustained delivery of the analogue can be demonstrated by continued suppression of testosterone synthesis over time).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, sustained delivery of the agent may be demonstrated by detecting the presence of the agent in vivo over time.
    </p>
    <p num="21">As used herein, the term "subject" is intended to include warm-blooded animals, preferably manunals, more preferably primates and most preferably humans.</p>
    <p num="22">As used herein, the term "administering to a subject" is intended to refer to dispensing, delivering or applying a composition (e.g., pharmaceutical formulation) to a subject by any suitable route for delivery of the composition to the desired location in the subject, including delivery by either the parenteral or oral route, intramuscular injection, subcutaneous/intradermal injection, intravenous injection, buccal administration, transdermal delivery and administration by the rectal, colonic, vaginal, intranasal or respiratory tract route.</p>
    <p num="23">
      As used herein, the term "a condition treatable with an LHRH analogue" is intended to include diseases, disorders and other conditions in which administration of an LHRH agonist or LHRH antagonist has a desired effect, e.g., a therapeutically beneficial effect.
      <br/>
      Examples of conditions treatable with an LHRH analogue include hormone-dependent cancers (including prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer and testicular cancer), benign prostatic hypertrophy, precocious puberty, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, infertility (through in vitro fertilization) and fertility (i.e., contraceptive uses).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      One aspect of the present invention pertains to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a water-insoluble complex of a pharmaceutically active peptidic compound and a carrier macromolecule.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, formation of the water-insoluble complex is mediated at least in part by ionic interactions between the pharmaceutically active peptidic and the carrier macromolecule.
      <br/>
      In these embodiments, either the pharmaceutically active peptidic compound is cationic and the carrier macromolecule is anionic or the pharmaceutically active peptidic compound is anionic and the carrier macromolecule is cationic.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, formation of the water-insoluble complex is mediated at least in part by hydrophobic interactions between the pharmaceutically active peptidic compound and the carrier macromolecule.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the peptidic compound used in the complex is a multivalent cationic peptidic compound, such as a bivalent or trivalent cationic peptidic compound and the carrier macromolecule is an anionic macromolecule.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention permit sustained delivery of the peptidic compound to a subject in vivo after administering the composition to the subject, wherein the duration of the sustained delivery can be varied depending upon the concentration of peptidic compound and carrier macromolecule used to form the complex.
      <br/>
      For example, in one embodiment, a single dose of the water-insoluble complex provides sustained delivery of the peptidic compound to a subject for at least one week after the pharmaceutical composition is administered to the subject.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, a single dose of the water-insoluble complex provides sustained delivery of the peptidic compound to a subject for at least two weeks after the pharmaceutical composition is administered to the subject.
      <br/>
      In yet another one embodiment, a single dose of the water-insoluble complex provides sustained delivery of the peptidic compound to a subject for at least three weeks after the pharmaceutical composition is administered to the subject.
      <br/>
      In still another embodiment, a single dose of the water-insoluble complex provides sustained delivery of the peptidic compound to a subject for at least four weeks after the pharmaceutical composition is administered to the subject.
      <br/>
      Formulations that provide sustained delivery for longer or shorter durations are also encompassed by the invention, such as formulations that provide continuous delivery for 1 day, 1-7 days, one month, two months, three months, and the like.
      <br/>
      Continuous delivery of the peptidic compound for a period of several months can be accomplished, for example, by repeated monthly dosages, each of which provide sustained delivery of the peptidic compound for approximately one month (see e.g., Example 14).

      Any size peptidic compound may be suitable for use in the complex as long as the peptidic compound has the ability to form a water-insoluble noncovalent complex with the carrier macromolecule upon combination of the peptidic compound and carrier macromolecule.

      The term "small polar moiety" refers to a moiety which has small steric bulk and is relatively polar.
      <br/>
      Polarity is measured as hydrophilicity by the P scale.
      <br/>
      The partition coefficient, P, between 1-octanol and water has been used as a reference for measuring the hydrophilicity of a compound.
      <br/>
      Hydrophilicity can be expressed as log P, the logarithm of the partition coefficient (Hansch et al., Nature 194:178 (1962); Fujita et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 86:5175 (1964)).
      <br/>
      Standard tables of hydrophilicity for many molecules, and lipophilicity (hydrophobicity) substituent constants (denoted  PI ) for many functional groups, have been compiled (see, e.g., Hansch and Leo, "Substituent Constants for Correlation Analysis in Chemistry and Biology," Wiley, New York, N.Y., (1979)).
      <br/>
      The hydrophilicity of a vast range of candidate hydrophilicity moieties can be quite accurately predicted with the aid of these tables.
      <br/>
      For example, the measured log P (octanol/water) of naphthalene is 3.45. The substituent constant p for --OH is -0.67. Therefore, the predicted log P for  BETA -naphthol is 3.45 +(-0.67)=2.78. This value is in good agreement with the measured log P for  BETA -naphthol, which is 2.84. As used herein, the term "small polar moiety" refers to moieties that have a log P between -1 and +2 and a steric bulk that is less than the steric bulk of Trp.

      providing a peptidic compound and a carrier macromolecule;
      <br/>
      combining the peptidic compound and the carrier macromolecule under conditions such that a water-insoluble complex of the peptidic compound and the carrier macromolecule forms; and
      <br/>
      preparing a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the water-insoluble complex.

      For example, a solution of the peptidic compound and a solution of the carrier macromolecule are combined until a water-insoluble complex of the peptidic compound and the carrier macromolecule precipitates out of solution.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, the solutions of the peptidic compound and the carrier macromolecule are aqueous solutions.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if the peptidic compound or the carrier molecule (or both) is not substantially water soluble prior to combination the two, then the peptidic compound and/or carrier macromolecule can be dissolved in a water-miscible solvent, such as an alcohol (e.g., ethanol) prior to combining the two components of the complex.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment of the method of preparing the water-insoluble complex, the solution of the peptidic compound and the solution of the carrier macromolecule are combined and heated until a water-insoluble complex of the peptidic compound and the carrier macromolecule precipitates out of solution.

      The amounts of peptidic compound and carrier macromolecule necessary to achieve the water-insoluble complex may vary depending upon the particular peptidic compound and carrier macromolecule used, the particular solvent(s) used and/or the procedure used to achieve the complex.
      <br/>
      Typically, however, the peptidic compound will be in excess relative to the carrier macromolecule on a molar basis.
      <br/>
      Often, the peptidic compound also will be in excess on a weight/weight basis, as demonstrated in the Examples.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, the carrier macromolecule, preferably carboxymethylcellulose sodium, and the peptidic compound, preferably PPI-149, are combined at a ratio of 0.2:1 (w/w) of carrier macromolecule:peptidic compound.

      The recovered paste then can be dried (e.g., in vacuo or in a 70 (degree)  C. oven) and the solid can be milled or pulverized to a powder by means known in the art (e.g., hammer or gore milling, or grinding in mortar and pestle).

      Other suitable parental routes include intravenous injection, buccal administration, transdermal delivery and administration by the rectal, vaginal, intranasal or respiratory tract route.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that when a formulation that provides sustained delivery for weeks to months by the i.m or s.c./i.d. route is administered by an alternative route, there may not be sustained delivery of the agent for an equivalent length of time due to clearance of the agent by other physiological mechanisms (i.e., the dosage form may be cleared from the site of delivery such that prolonged therapeutic effects are not observed for time periods as long as those observed with i.m or s.c./i.d. injection).

      A non-limiting range for a therapeutically effective amount of an LHRH analogue is 0.01 to 10 mg/kg.
      <br/>
      A preferred dosage of the LHRH analogue PPI-149 for sustained reduction of plasma testosterone levels for 28 days is approximately 0.1-10 mg/kg, more preferably 0.3-1.2 mg/kg (expressed as free peptide) in a liquid suspension volume of approximately 1 mL or less.

      Approximately 40 mg of each of two separate PPI-149-CMC lots was packed separately (under an air headspace) in to a number of Type 1 Glass vials, sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum seals.

      Vials were then subjected to a variety of nominal doses of gamma-irradiation.

      A second study utilizing higher doses of gamma exposure was performed on an additional laboratory lot of PPI-149-CMC.

    <p num="83">
      A particle size method using laser light scattering was developed, that is applicable to sizing studies of PPI-149-CMC.
      <br/>
      To illustrate the utility of the method, a preformulation experiment is presented, which was performed to investigate the effect of gamma-irradiation on the particle size of PPI-149-CMC.
      <br/>
      This experiment was conceived with the prior understanding that amorphous solid materials may be predisposed to particle consolidation, upon storage.
      <br/>
      Two samples of a laboratory lot of PPI-149-CMC were packed in type I glass vials, closed with gray butyl rubber stoppers and sealed with aluminum seals.
      <br/>
      Particle evaluation was performed prior to and following exposure to a gamma irradiation dose of 15.5 KGy. Particle evaluation was performed by laser light scattering (utilizing a Malvern Mastersizer S (tm)  equipped with a reverse fourier lens). 20 mg samples for particle size analysis by laser light scattering were dispersed in approximately 0.5 mL deionised water by vigorous shaking, then sonicated in a bath at ambient temperature for 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      After running a background count, a method qualification experiment was performed.
      <br/>
      Sample dispersion was added drop-wise to the continuous feed reservoir (approximately 60 mL nominal volume) until approximately 20% obscuration was obtained.
      <br/>
      The mixer rotation speed was held at 2700 rpm throughout the experiment (plus background check).
      <br/>
      At this speed no vortex-induced bubbles were generated, but an adequately stable dispersion was maintained.
      <br/>
      Eight scans were performed, analysis of acquired data indicated a standard deviation of &lt;0.03% as the extreme of any data point taken.
      <br/>
      When the sample dispersion was held in the reservoir for 15 minutes and then re-run, no significant change resulted, indicating the absence of particle dissolution over the course of the experiment.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Samples were analyzed using the experimental parameters given above.
      <br/>
      Eight scans were performed and mean particle diameter data was determined.
      <br/>
      Two distinct size distributions were noted, and all had a clean cut-off at the high-end particle size, indicating the absence of particle aggregation.
      <br/>
      One lot of PPI-149-CMC had apparently lower mean volume diameter prior to gamma irradiation than the sample post-irradiation.
      <br/>
      This preformulation study would seem to indicate some particle consolidation occurred during the sterilization process.

    <p num="89">
      In a subsequent study, a 60 mg sample of PPI-149-CMC (post gamma-irradiation) was placed in a type I glass vial and placed in a pre-equilibrated constant humidity incubator at 50 (degree)  C./75% Relative Humidity for 5 days.
      <br/>
      Immediately after withdrawal from the incubator, the sample container was closed with a gray butyl rubber stopper and sealed with an aluminum seal.
      <br/>
      The X-ray powder diffractogram of this stressed sample was then compared to another sample of the same lot that had been held at room temperature in a closed container.
      <br/>
      The samples were analyzed using a Siemens D500 automated Powder Diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator and a Cu ( LAMBDA =1.54  Angstrom ) X-Ray source operated at 50 kV, 40mA.
      <br/>
      The two-theta scan range was 4-40 (degree)  using a step scan window of 0.05 (degree) /1.2 second step.

      Beam slits were set at No. (1) 1 (degree) , (2) 1 (degree) , (3) 1 (degree) , (4) 0.15 (degree)  and (5) 0.15 (degree)  widths.
      <br/>
      Two-theta calibration was performed using an NBS mica standard (SRM 675).

      The samples were analyzed using a zero background sample plate.

    <p num="90">
      The data indicated that prior to gamma irradiation, PPI-149-CMC had no apparent crystalline or pseudo-crystalline structure.
      <br/>
      In fact, it gave an X-ray powder diffraction pattern characteristic of an amorphous solid (a broad hump between 2-20 (degree)  20, with no significant peaks in the diffractogram).
      <br/>
      The PPI-149-CMC sample post-irradiation generated a very similar diffraction pattern to the non-irradiated sample, indicating that gamma-irradiation processing (at doses up to and including 19 KGy) does not apparently induce a solid-state polymorphic transition within the material.
      <br/>
      In a similar manner, the temperature/humidity stressed sample of PPI-149-CMC generated a very similar diffraction pattern to both the non-irradiated sample and the irradiated sample, which strongly suggests that PPI-149-CMC is not unduly prone to induction of solid-state polymorphic transitions within the material.

    <p num="92">
      Preformulation studies on PPI-149-CMC (post-irradiation) were performed to determine the equilibrium moisture uptake (measured by weight gain) at constant temperature (25 (degree)  C.) under various conditions of relative humidity.

      Analysis of the equilibrium moisture (% water) as a function of relative humidity (% RH) indicated that moisture content gradually increased up to approximately 80% relative humidity.
      <br/>
      At high relative humidity (95% RH) PPI-149-CMC was capable of significant moisture sorption.
      <br/>
      At relative humidities at or below 80% RH, significant precautions in terms of protection from moisture are deemed unnecessary; thus certain manufacturing steps may be undertaken under ambient humidity conditions (provided humidity extremes are avoided).

      All three samples gave ostensibly a similar peptide equilibrium solubility.

    <p num="99">
      This study was designed such that the efficacy of PPI-149-CMC at an initial dose in different vehicles was assessed during the first month of treatment.
      <br/>
      During the second month on-study, the dogs received lower doses of PPI-149-CMC in an attempt to determine an efficacious "maintenance" dose.
      <br/>
      The third month was scheduled to evaluate the long term safety and efficacy characteristics of PPI-149-CMC.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      IM or SC doses of PPI-149-CMC formulated in one of the reconstitution vehicles, or IM doses of control article, were administered on each dosing day into the upper flank of the right hind limb (IM) or in the mid-scapular region (SC).
      <br/>
      Material was drawn into a icc tuberculin syringe with a 23 g short bevel needle.
      <br/>
      The injection site was wiped with an alcohol swab immediately prior to dosing.
      <br/>
      The volume injected was based on a specific dose of peptide/kg body weight.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that all doses refer to the amount of PPI-149 peptide administered.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      Each animal was observed at least twice daily during the entire study for overt signs of toxic or pharmacologic effect and changes in general behavior and appearance.
      <br/>
      All abnormal clinical observations were recorded.
    </p>
    <p num="102">Blood was collected prior to administration of the first dose and at various times following dosing, for complete blood counts (CBC), serum chemistry analysis, and determination of PPI-149 and testosterone concentrations twice weekly by radioimmunoassays.</p>
    <p num="103">
      After three months on-study, nine animals were sacrificed and their tissues collected for gross pathological and histopathological analysis.
      <br/>
      Animals were selected for sacrifice from the vehicle control group, one of the IM dosing groups and one of the SC dosing groups.
      <br/>
      The tissues collected for gross pathology and histopathology at the 3 month sacrifice were: administration Site (SC or IM), adrenal glands, aorta, bone, bone marrow, brain, diaphragm, epididymis, esophagus, eyes with optic nerve, heart, kidneys, large intestine (cecum, colon), liver with gall bladder, lungs with bronchi, lymph nodes, pancreas, pituitary gland, prostate gland with urethra, salivary glands, sciatic nerve, skeletal muscle, skin, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), spinal cord, spleen, stomach, testes, thymus, thryoid gland with parathyroid, tongue, trachea, urinary bladder and gross lesions.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      There were no significant changes in hematology or blood chemistry from baseline during the study for either treated or control animals.
      <br/>
      Gross and histological evaluation at the three month sacrifice showed no apparent differences between PPI-149-CMC treated dogs and control (vehicle-treated) animals, with the exception of changes in the testes and prostate, as expected with this LHRH antagonist.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Regarding PPI-149-CMC pharmacokinetics, all dogs treated with 1.2 mg/kg PPI-149-CMC resuspended in a variety of reconstitution vehicles and administered IM or SC showed similar plasma PPI-149 pharmacokinetic profiles, with plasma concentration peaking within the first 2 days and then decreasing slowly in an exponential manner over the following month.
      <br/>
      PPI-149-CMC gave similar plasma distribution of PPI-149 when suspended in any of the three reconstitution vehicles used in the study.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      Regarding PPI-149-CMC endocrine efficacy, castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;0.6 ng/mL) were observed within 24 hours of initiation of PPI-149-CMC dosing in all dogs, and levels generally remained in the castrate range throughout the first month regardless of the route of administration or choice of reconstitution vehicle.
      <br/>
      Twenty-six (26) of 35 dogs (75%) had castrate levels of testosterone in a blood sample obtained immediately prior to administration of the second dose of PPI-149-CMC on Day 29.
      <br/>
      These results indicate that an initial dose of 1.2 mg/kg in dogs successfully induces a rapid, long-lasting suppression (&gt;28 days) in plasma testosterone.
      <br/>
      In the second month of dosing, when the efficacy of a "maintenance" dose (a dose lower than the initial dose) was investigated, the results indicated that administration of 0.3 or 0.6 mg/kg of PPI-149-CMC maintained castrate levels of testosterone for more than 20 days in 30 out of 35 dogs.
      <br/>
      At the end of the second month of treatment (Day 57), 21 of 35 dogs (60%) remained castrate, while 14 animals had testosterone in the normal range (&gt;0.6% ng/mL).
      <br/>
      A dose of 1.2 mg/kg was administered in the beginning of the third month.
      <br/>
      Plasma concentrations of PPI-149 were sustained for the following twenty-eight day period while plasma levels of testosterone were again "castrate." By the end of the third month (Day 85), plasma levels of testosterone were shown to be in the castrate range in 30 of 35 PPI-149-CMC-treated dogs.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      In summary, thirty-five (35) dogs received 1.2 mg/kg PPI-149-CMC on Day 1, 0.3 or 0.6 mg/kg PPI-149-CMC on Day 29 and 1.2 mg/kg PPI-149-CMC on Day 57, using IM or SC dosing with a variety of reconstitution vehicles.
      <br/>
      Of these 35 dogs, 19 animals (54%) had plasma testosterone levels which remained in the castrate range throughout the entire course of therapy.
      <br/>
      Thus, administration of PPI-149-CMC at 28 day intervals was able to result in complete suppression of plasma testosterone which is rapid (all animals had castrate levels within 24 hours) and long-lasting (maintained throughout the course of administration).
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      A similar study to that described above was conducted for six months in dogs to further evaluate the long term safety and efficacy characteristics of PPI-149-CMC.
      <br/>
      Animals received an initial dose of 1.2 mg/kg PPI-149-CMC either IM or SC and five subsequent doses (at a concentration of either 0.3 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg) at 28 day intervals.
      <br/>
      Plasma testosterone and PPI-149 levels were evaluated by radioimmunoassay at regular intervals.
      <br/>
      Representative results are shown in FIG. 4 (for SC treatment) and FIG. 5 (for IM treatment), which illustrate plasma testosterone levels (open boxes) and PPI-149 levels (closed boxes).
      <br/>
      The particular dosages used at each administration of PPI-149-CMC are shown on the graphs.
      <br/>
      The results illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5 further demonstrate that administration of PPI-149-CMC at 28 day intervals was able to result in complete suppression of plasma testosterone which is rapid and long-lasting, with reduced plasma testosterone levels being maintained for as long as six months.
