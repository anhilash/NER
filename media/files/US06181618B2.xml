    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device having dynamic type RAM (DRAM) cells integrated and arranged, more specifically, to a semiconductor memory device capable of realizing a low power consumption, an enlarged operation margin and a high speed operation of a sense amplifier, a high reliability and a high current driving ability of a transistor by a transmission gate comprising a P-type MOS transistor.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Recently, according to the increase of the demand for portable apparatus, smaller appliances mounted with a semiconductor device are demanded.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the mounted semiconductor device is required to be highly integrated and to consume low power so as to prolong the time to be used with a battery.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Among semiconductor memory devices, since a memory cell has a comparatively simple structure in a semiconductor memory device such as DRAM, a high integration has been achieved.
      <br/>
      According to the high integration, patterns and elements have been even minute to deteriorate the pressure resistance, and the like so that a lower voltage is needed for the power source voltage for driving according to the scaling rule so as to ensure the reliability and a lower power consumption.
    </p>
    <p num="4">For example, in a 16 M bit DRAM, the power source voltage is being shifted from the conventional Vcc=5V to Vcc=3.3V. Further, in a 256 M bit DRAM, the power source voltage to be supplied is considered to become Vcc=2.5V.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Furthermore, as a minimum processing size, about 0.15  MU m is considered to be necessary.
      <br/>
      In a 1 G bit DRAM, a low power source voltage of about Vcc=1.8V is expected.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In these DRAMs, since a signal charge amount stored in a memory cell as data is minute, a highly sensitive bit line sense amplifier is needed for detecting, amplifying and reading it to the outside.
      <br/>
      Since the signal amount read out from the memory cell to be detected and amplified by the bit line sense amplifier is proportional to the power source voltage, when the power source voltage is scaled and lowered as mentioned above, the read signal amount decreases proportionally.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In general, as the bit line sense amplifier, a dynamic type differential amplifying circuit comprising an N-type sense amplifier where two sets of NMOS transistors (hereinafter NMOS is referred to as N-type) are connected by cross-coupling, and a P-type sense amplifier where two sets of PMOS transistors (hereinafter PMOS is referred to as P-type) are similarly connected by cross-coupling is used.</p>
    <p num="8">As shown in FIG. 28, as a precharge voltage of a bit line, which serves as the input terminal to the sense amplifier, the Vcc/2 precharge method, which is 1/2 of the power source voltage is used.</p>
    <p num="9">
      To explain the Vcc/2 precharge method simply, in a precharge cycle where the outside control signal RAS bar (hereinafter bar represents a reverse signal -) is at the "H" level, a bit line pair is precharged to Vcc/2.
      <br/>
      When the RAS bar signal shifts from the "H" to the "L" level to be in a state where the DRAM can read and write (active mode), the bit line precharge/equalize circuit is shut off so that the bit line precharged to be Vcc/2 becomes floating so that the word line WL selected by the external input address is driven, and data are read from the memory cell to the bit line.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The bit line sense amplifier is activated so that a minute signal read out to the bit line is detected and amplified.</p>
    <p num="11">
      More specifically, the "L" level side of the bit line pair is discharged to a ground voltage (Vss) by the above-mentioned N-type sense amplifier.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the "H" level side of the bit line pair is charged to the power source voltage (Vcc) by the P-type sense amplifier.
      <br/>
      After completing the reading operation, the bit line is equalized and precharged to the Vcc/2 voltage again.
    </p>
    <p num="12">As a method for achieving a low power source voltage in a semiconductor memory device such as the above-mentioned DRAM, a method of reducing the bit line discharge current by having a smaller bit line voltage amplitude has been advocated conventionally.</p>
    <p num="13">
      However, in the case with a small amplitude for the bit line voltage amplitude, since the voltage difference between a gate and a source of the transistor comprising the flip flop type sense amplifier becomes small, a problem of deterioration of the operation speed of the sense amplifier is involved.
      <br/>
      In a semiconductor memory device having a memory capacity of the G bit level, since the power source voltage Vcc becomes extremely small as 1.8V or less, a voltage between the gate and the source necessary for the sense amplifier transistor operation, that is, a voltage not less than the threshold voltage of the sense amplifier transistor cannot be obtained between the gate and the source of the sense amplifier transistor to disable the sense operation, and thus it is problematic.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      That is, in the case of a DRAM using the above-mentioned Vcc/2 precharge method, due to the lower source voltage, in the sense amplifier operation, the voltage between the gate and the source (Vcc/2) to be applied to the transistor comprising the sense amplifier itself inevitably lowers.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, there is a risk that the sense operation is drastically delayed or the sense operation cannot be implemented.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      For example, in the case of the source voltage Vcc=1.8V, only Vcc=0.9V is applied between the gate and the source of the sense amplifier transistor.
      <br/>
      Actually, the voltage is lowered by the resistance of the common source wiring of the sense amplifier transistor, in particular, in the initial sensing time, the value can be further smaller.
    </p>
    <p num="16">On the other hand, the absolute value .vertline.Vth.vertline. of the threshold voltage of the sense amplifier transistor (it is a positive voltage in an N-type sense amplifier, but a negative voltage in a P-type sense amplifier) needs to be at least 0.3V to 0.5V in order to guarantee the threshold value irregularity and the cut off characteristic.</p>
    <p num="17">
      At the time of the initial sensing, the substantial .vertline.Vth.vertline. is further raised in combination with the back gate effect of the sense amplifier transistor.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the voltage between the gate and the source of the sense amplifier transistor and the threshold voltage are extremely close at the time of the initial sensing so that the initial sensing is drastically delayed.
      <br/>
      And thus a serious problem is involved in terms of the high speed operation of the DRAM.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Among the transistors used in the DRAM, a highest voltage (boosting voltage) is applied to the gate electrode of the memory cell transistor.
      <br/>
      This is because the "H" level needs to be written in the memory cell.
      <br/>
      The gate voltage needed therefor is represented by VBLH+Vth'. Herein VBLH represents the "H" level voltage, and Vth' represents the threshold voltage of the memory cell transistor where a negative voltage is applied to the back gate (substrate) of the memory cell transistor and the source voltage is VBLH.
    </p>
    <p num="19">In order to maximize the charge to be accumulated in the memory cell capacitor in general, VBLH is equal to the source voltage in the chip (Vdd).</p>
    <p num="20">
      In general, since the gate oxide film of the same thickness is used for all the transistors in the chip for the production cost reduction, a transistor, of which gate electrode is not applied with the boosting voltage inevitably uses the thick gate oxide film the same as the memory cell transistor.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the transistors used in the DRAM have a problem in that their performance such as the current driving ability is low compared with a transistor of a logical semiconductor, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In order to improve the transistor performance by having a thinner gate oxide film, the boosting voltage can be lowered to reduce the voltage to be applied to the gate oxide film of the memory cell transistor.
      <br/>
      However, in that case, the source voltage in the chip inevitably becomes low so that since only 1/2 Vdd can be applied between the gate and the source of the transistor comprising the sense amplifier at most in the general 1/2 Vdd precharge method, a problem is involved in that the sense amplifier cannot function.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In general, an equalize circuit is provided in a bit line pair, a data line pair, a sense amplifier driving line, and the like.
      <br/>
      For example, a bit line equalize circuit conventionally comprises only N-type transistors as shown in FIG. 29.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Since a large capacity is aimed at in a semiconductor memory these days, the redundancy technique for saving a defect memory cell generated in the production is in dispensable.
      <br/>
      However, even if it is saved, the defect cannot be eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      For example, in the case a defect is generated in the short circuit between the bit line and the word line shown in FIG. 30, the memory cell is replaced (saved) by the redundancy technique.
      <br/>
      However, as mentioned above, since the defect remains as it is, at the time of operating the equalize circuit, through current flows in the route shown by the dot line in the figure, that is, VBL --&gt; PRCH --&gt; bit line --&gt; word line --&gt; row decoder.
    </p>
    <p num="25">When the through current is large, or a large number of short circuit defects are generated between the bit line and the word line, although the memory cell can be saved with the redundancy technique, since the current consumption becomes larger than the standard range, the chip becomes "defect".</p>
    <p num="26">
      In order to restrain the through current, a method of inserting a current limiting circuit between the precharge circuit and the precharge voltage supply line as shown in FIG. 31 is proposed.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that the current limiting circuit comprises a P-type transistor.
      <br/>
      At the time, problems are involved in that (1) the sense amplifying area is enlarged due to the necessity of the well separation with respect to the equalize/precharge circuit portion, and (2) a wiring is required for connecting the precharge circuit and the current limiting circuit.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="31">Hereinafter embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanied drawings.</p>
    <p num="32">A dynamic type RAM (DRAM) having a block configuration as shown in FIG. 1 is used in a semiconductor memory device of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="33">
      In the configuration, by having the voltage amplitude of pairs of bit lines BL1, BL1 bar, BL2, BL2 bar, (hereinafter bar denotes the reverse signal-), which serve as complementary lines with respect to a memory cell array portion 1, smaller than the range of the power source voltage Vcc, a small power consumption is to be realized.
      <br/>
      In addition to that, by having the voltage amplitude between the bit lines in a sense amplifier portion 2 larger than the voltage amplitude of the bit lines of the memory cell array portion 1, and having the precharge voltage of the bit lines of the sense amplifier portion 2 and the precharge voltage of the bit lines of the memory cell array portion 1 different, the voltage difference between the gate and the source of the transistor comprising the sense amplifier can be large so that a high speed and secure sense amplifying operation can be realized even when the voltage amplitude of the bit lines of the memory cell array portion 1 is small.
    </p>
    <p num="34">By connecting the sense amplifier portion 2 to the memory cell array portion 1 via a P-type transfer gate 3 comprising a PMOS transistor (hereinafter PMOS is referred to as P-type), a large bit line voltage amplitude in the sense amplifier portion 2 is converted to a small bit line amplitude in the memory cell array portion 1 without the need of adding a new circuit.</p>
    <p num="35">In an embodiment later described, by connecting a P-type sense amplifier comprising a P-type transistor and an N-type sense amplifier comprising an NMOS transistor (hereinafter NMOS is referred to as N-type) to the memory cell array portion via an N-type transfer gate comprising an N-type transistor and a P-type transfer gate, the same effect can be achieved.</p>
    <p num="36">Further, an ordinary column selector 4, a bit line equalizer 5, a column decoder (not shown), and a row decoder 7 are provided.</p>
    <p num="37">
      FIG. 2 shows an equivalent circuit of the memory cell array portion and the sense amplifier portion in a DRAM according to a first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Herein only the characteristic part from the configuration of FIG. 1 is presented for explaining the operation.
    </p>
    <p num="38">In the circuit configuration, a memory cell array portion 11 is connected to a sense amplifier portion 14 with a bit line pair BL, BL bar via P-type transfer gates 12, 13.</p>
    <p num="39">
      In the memory cell array portion 11, for example, a plurality of memory cells are arranged two-dimensionally.
      <br/>
      Word lines WL0, WL1 are connected to the memory cells 15, 16 as representatives thereof in the row direction.
      <br/>
      A bit line pair BL (array), BL (array) bar is connected in the column direction orthogonal thereto, with P-type transfer gates 12, 13 connected to one end thereof.
      <br/>
      The P-type transfer gates 12, 13 are driven by a control signal  PHI T to be inputted to a transfer gate control line 19 later described.
      <br/>
      In embodiments described hereinafter, although the memory cell array portion comprises a plurality of memory cells, only a representative memory cell will be referred to in order to simplify the explanation.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The sense amplifier portion 14 comprises an N-type sense amplifier 17 comprising N-type transistor pair and a P-type sense amplifier 18 comprising a P-type transistor connected by cross-coupling.
      <br/>
      One of gates of each sense amplifier is connected to a bit line BL (S/A) and the other is connected to BL (S/A) bar. The N-type sense amplifier 17 is connected to an N-type sense amplifier driving line SAN bar in the row direction, and the P-type sense amplifier 18 is connected to a P-type sense amplifier connecting line SAP in the row direction.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      When the sensing operation is conducted, and the voltages of the bit lines BL (S/A) and BL (S/A) bar in the sense amplifier portion are VBLH (bit-line voltage high) and VBLL (bit-line voltage low) in this configuration, since the bit lines BL (array) and BL (array) bar are connected to the bit lines BL (S/A) and BL (S/A) bar via the P-type transfer gates 12, 13, respectively, the voltage of BL (array) becomes VBLH (the same as the power source voltage Vcc), and the voltage of BL (array) bar becomes VBLL+.vertline.Vthp.vertline. owing to the so-called threshold value drop effect.
      <br/>
      Herein Vthp represents the threshold voltage of the P-type transistor comprising the transfer gate.
    </p>
    <p num="42">The sensing/restoring operation will be explained in detail with reference to the voltage wave form of the bit line of the memory cell array portion and the voltage wave form of the bit line of the sense amplifier portion in FIG. 3.</p>
    <p num="43">The voltage levels shown in FIG. 3 represent the boosting voltage Vpp as the high level of the word line WL, the power source voltage Vcc, the precharge voltage of the bit line VBL, the GND voltage Vss, the bit line voltage of the low level of the memory cell array portion VBLL, the bit line voltage of the high level VBLH, and the threshold voltage of the transfer gate comprising the P-type transistor Vthp.</p>
    <p num="44">The voltage wave forms represent the voltage wave form of the word line WL, the voltage wave form of the bit line BL (array) of the memory cell array portion, the voltage wave form of the bit line BL (array) bar of the memory cell array portion, the voltage wave form of the bit line BL (array) bar of the memory cell array portion to be paired up with the above-mentioned bit line BL (array), the voltage wave form of the bit line BL (S/A) of the sense amplifier portion, and the voltage wave form of the bit line BL (S/A) bar to be paired up with the bit line BL (S/A).</p>
    <p num="45">In the initial state before implementing the sensing/restoring operation, that is, in the precharge period, the voltage of the bit lines (BL (array), BL (array), BL (S/A), BL (S/A) bar) to be connected to the memory cell array portion 11 and the sense amplifier portion 14, and the voltage of the sense amplifier driving lines (SAN bar, SAP) are precharged to the bit line precharge voltage VBL.</p>
    <p num="46">The voltage of the word lines WL0, WL1 are set to the GND voltage Vss, and the transfer gate control line 19 is inactivated.</p>

      This embodiment is an example with a configuration of FIG. 2, where the precharge voltages are different in the voltage wave form of the bit line of the memory cell array portion ad the voltage wave form of the bit line of the sense amplifier portion as shown in FIG. 5.

      In this embodiment, in the precharge period before the sensing/restoring operation, the precharge voltage of the bit lines BL (array), BL (array) bar side to be connected to the memory cell array portion 11 is precharged to a Vcc voltage, which is higher than the precharge voltage of the bit lines BL (S/A), BL (S/A) bar side of the sense amplifier portion.
      <br/>
      The word lines WL0, WL1 are activated so that information is transferred from the memory cell to the bit line of the memory cell array portion, then the transfer gate control line 19 is activated.

    <p num="72">
      In this embodiment, the available setting range of the precharge voltage VBL (S/A) for the bit lines BL (S/A), BL (S/A) bar of the sense amplifier portion 14 is:

    <p num="74">
      When the transfer gate control line 19 is activated in the precharge state with the precharge voltage difference of Vcc and VBL, the precharge voltage Vcc of the bit lines BL (S/A), BL (S/A) bar lowers, and the precharge voltage of the bit lines BL (/A), BL (S/A) bar rises as shown in FIG. 5.

      The voltage ( DELTA V) where the voltages coincide rises according to the capacity ratio of the bit line capacity of the bit line of the sense amplifier portion and the bit line of the memory cell array portion.
    </p>
    <p num="75">For example, with the premise that the bit line capacity of the sense amplifier portion is CB (S/A), the bit line capacity of the memory cell array portion is CB (array), the voltages of the bit lines of the memory cell array portion and the sense amplifier portion before activating the transfer gate control line 19 are V array, V S/A, respectively, the increased voltage can be sought for the bit line of the sense amplifier portion ( DELTA VSA) and for the bit line of the memory cell array portion ( DELTA Varray) by:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>

      Since the voltage difference can be generated at the low voltage side between the memory cell array portion 11 and the sense amplifier portion 14 by the threshold voltage Vthp of the P-type transistor comprising the transfer gate 19, the voltage difference can always be ensured for the threshold voltage Vthp even if the higher voltage (power source voltage Vcc) side becomes lower so that a secure sensing/restoring operation can be enabled.
