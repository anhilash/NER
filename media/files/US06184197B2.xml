    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to polymeric compounds comprising one or more active alcohols.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it relates to amino functional polymeric compounds comprising one or more active alcohols suitable for use in laundry and cleaning products.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Cleaning and laundry products are well-known in the art.
      <br/>
      However, consumer acceptance of cleaning and laundry products is determined not only by the performance achieved with these products but also the aesthetics associated therewith.
      <br/>
      The perfume components are therefore an important aspect of the successful formulation of such commercial products.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Accordingly, formulation of compounds which provide a delayed release of the perfume over a longer period of time than by the use of the perfume itself have been provided.
      <br/>
      Disclosure of such compounds may be found in WO 95/04809, WO 95/08976 and pending application EP 95303762.9. The latter describes betaine ester compounds of perfume alcohols which provide release of the perfume components over a long period of time.
    </p>
    <p num="4">The Applicant has now found that polymers containing one or more nitrogen atoms to which an ester function is linked, so as to provide an N-polymeric betaine ester and/or amino ester of an active alcohol, also provide a delayed release of the active alcohol such as a perfume.</p>
    <p num="5">Another advantage of the present invention is that the polymeric group provides sufficient stabilisation of the ester function so that the release of the active alcohol upon storage in product is limited, without hindering the release of the active alcohol upon use of the product.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">The present invention relates to a polymer containing at least one nitrogen atoms, wherein at least one of the nitrogen atoms is linked to an ester group of formula:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="7">wherein each R'1, R'2, independently, is selected from hydrogen, hydroxyl, alkyl group, alkylene group, aryl group, alkylaryl, or any other chain containing at least 1 carbon atom, wherein n3 is an integer lying in the range from 1 to 3, and wherein R is an organic chain of an active alcohol.</p>
    <p num="8">The present invention also encompasses laundry and cleaning compositions incorporating said polymeric compound.</p>
    <p num="9">In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for providing a delayed release of an active alcohol which comprises the step of contacting materials to be treated with an aqueous medium comprising a compound or composition of the invention.</p>
    <p num="10">In a further aspect of the invention, a process is provided for preparing a polymeric ester compound of the invention, by reacting a polyaminofunctional polymer with a bromoacetate and/or chloroacetate of an active alcohol in the presence of a non hydroxylated solvent.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">Polymeric Compound</p>
    <p num="12">The essential component of the invention is a polymer containing at least one nitrogen atom, wherein at least one of the nitrogen atoms is linked to an ester group of formula:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="13">wherein each R'1, R'2, independently, is selected from hydrogen, hydroxyl, alkyl group, alkylene group, aryl group, alkylaryl group, or any other chain containing at least 1 carbon atom, wherein n3 is an integer lying in the range from 1 to 3, preferably n3 is an integer of value 1, and wherein R is an organic chain of an active alcohol.</p>
    <p num="14">The different groups for R'1, R'2 can be substituted or unsubstituted.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Preferably, each R'1, R'2, independently, is selected from hydrogen, alkyl group, aryl group, --(CH2)m --COOH, --(CH2)m --COOR, --(CH2)m,--OH, --(CH2)m,--O(O)CR' wherein each m, independently, is an integer of value 0, 1 or 2, and each m', independently, is an integer of value 1, 2 or 3, and R' is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 19 carbons.

      For example, it is known to those skilled in the art that ethanolamine may be used as an "initiator" in the synthesis of polyethyleneimines; therefore, a sample of polyethyleneimine that comprises one hydroxyethyl moiety resulting from the polymerization "initiator" would be considered to comprise a homogeneous polyamine backbone for the purposes of the present invention.

    <p num="45">For the purpose of the invention, mixtures of the above polymeric compounds comprising one or more active alcohols may also be used.</p>
    <p num="46">Mechanism of Release</p>
    <p num="47">
      By the present invention, a delayed release of an active alcohol is obtained.
      <br/>
      Not to be bound by theory, the release is believed to occur by the following mechanism:
      <br/>
      where the nitrogen atom is in a protonated form so as to form a betaine ester, the release of the active alcohol is obtained by hydrolysis of the betaine ester such as upon contact with water or ambient humidity;
      <br/>
      where the nitrogen bearing the ester of an active alcohol is in an unprotonated form, the nitrogen atom converts to a protonated form upon a pH drop so as to convert into a betaine and then provides a release of the active alcohol.
      <br/>
      The pH drop may occur, for example, by dilution of the compound in water.
    </p>
    <p num="48">Accordingly, when the polymeric compound contains both protonated nitrogen atoms bearing the ester of an active alcohol and unprotonated nitrogen atoms bearing the ester of an active alcohol, such as that occurs when the polymeric is a partially quarternised polymer, different delayed rate of release may be obtained: the betaine releasing first its active alcohol while the amino acid releasing its active alcohol only after conversion into its betaine form.</p>
    <p num="49">Process</p>
    <p num="50">Preparation of the component is made as follows in the Synthesis Examples.</p>
    <p num="51">
      A preferred process for preparing the polymeric compounds comprising one or more active alcohol is by reacting an amino-functional polymer such as a polyamine component with a bromoacetate and/or chloroacetate of an active alcohol in the presence of a non hydroxylated solvent such as chloroform, acetonitrile, acetone, ethyl acetate, or mixtures thereof, preferably chloroform and/or ethyl acetate.
      <br/>
      One advantage of the present process is that transamidation and/or even transesterification when the polymeric compound is partially ethoxylated is limited.
      <br/>
      Indeed, transesterification/transamidation is one of the problem which occurs during preparation of the polymeric compounds of the invention.
      <br/>
      Such a transesterification/transamidation leads to the breakdown of some perfume alcohol ester bonds and to the subsequent liberation of free perfume alcohol during the course of the reaction process.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, by using a non-hydroxylated solvent, the extent to which these side reactions occur are limited.
      <br/>
      For example, when using the present process, by reacting polyethyleneimine MW1800, ethoxylated with 0.5 mole of ethylene oxide, and geranyl bromoacetate in chloroform, the transesterification is limited to less than 20%, preferably less than 10% by mole of the starting material geranyl bromoacetate.
    </p>
    <p num="52">It will also be apparent to the skilled person in the art that when a PEI is reacted with a bromoacetate of an active alcohol only transamidation is seen as a side reaction.</p>
    <p num="53">
      Another process, which can be suitable for use herein, for preparing the polymeric compounds of the invention is to first prepare a polyamino methyl ester or a polyamino ethyl ester.
      <br/>
      The polyamino methyl ester or polyamino ethyl ester can be prepared by reacting a bromo ester or a chloro ester (such as methyl bromoacetate or methyl chloroacetate, methyl bromopropanoate or methyl chloropropanoate) with a polyamino-functional polymer.
      <br/>
      In a second step, this polyamino methyl ester (such as polyglycine methyl ester or polybetaine methyl ester) or polyamino ethyl ester is transesterified with an active alcohol (such as a perfume alcohol) in the presence of a catalytic to stoechiometric amount of sodium methoxide or sodium.
      <br/>
      For example, a polyglycine ester of geraniol can be prepared by reacting first methyl chloroacetate with a polyethylenimine and then transesterifying the intermediate polyglycine methyl ester with geraniol, using a catalytic amount of sodium methoxide.

      Indeed, it influences the stability of the quaternary ammonium or amine precursors compounds, especially in prolonged storage conditions.
      <br/>
      The pH, as defined in the present context, is measured in the neat compositions at 20 (degree)  C. For optimum hydrolytic stability of these compositions, the neat pH, measured in the above-mentioned conditions, must be in the range of from 2.0 to 4.5. Preferably, where the liquid fabric softening compositions of the invention are in a concentrated form, the pH of the neat composition is in the range of 2.0 to 3.5, while if it is in a diluted form, the pH of the neat composition is in the range of 2.0 to 3 0 (slashed zero)  The pH of these compositions herein can be regulated by the addition of a Bronsted acid.

      A preferred enzyme for use herein is a cellulase enzyme.
      <br/>
      Indeed, this type of enzyme will further provide a color care benefit to the treated fabric.
      <br/>
      Cellulases usable herein include both bacterial and fungal types, preferably having a pH optimum between 5 and 9.5. U.S. Pat. No. 4,435,307, Barbesgoard et al, Mar. 6, 1984, discloses suitable fungal cellulases from Humicola insolens or Humicola strain DSM1800 or a cellulase 212-producing fungus belonging to the genus Aeromonas, and cellulase extracted from the hepatopancreas of a marine mollusk, Dolabella Auricula Solander.

      Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.01%-1% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation.
      <br/>
      In the particular cases where activity of the enzyme preparation can be defined otherwise such as with cellulases, corresponding activity units are preferred (e.g. CEVU or cellulase Equivalent Viscosity Units).
      <br/>
      For instance, the compositions of the present invention can contain cellulase enzymes at a level equivalent to an activity from about 0.5 to 1000 CEVU/gram of composition.
      <br/>
      Cellulase enzyme preparations used for the purpose of formulating the compositions of this invention typically have an activity comprised between 1,000 and 10,000 CEVU/gram in liquid form, around 1,000 CEVU/gram in solid form.

    <p num="97">
      Concentrated compositions of the present invention may require organic and/or inorganic concentration aids to go to even higher concentrations and/or to meet higher stability standards depending on the other ingredients.
      <br/>
      Surfactant concentration aids are typically selected from the group consisting of single long chain alkyl cationic surfactants; nonionic surfactants; amine oxides; fatty acids; or mixtures thereof, typically used at a level of from 0 to 15% of the composition.

    <p num="98">
      Inorganic viscosity control agents which can also act like or augment the effect of the surfactant concentration aids, include water-soluble, ionizable salts which can also optionally be incorporated into the compositions of the present invention.
      <br/>
      A wide variety of ionizable salts can be used.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable salts are the halides of the Group IA and IIA metals of the Periodic Table of the Elements, e.g., calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, potassium bromide, and lithium chloride.
      <br/>
      The ionizable salts are particularly useful during the process of mixing the ingredients to make the compositions herein, and later to obtain the desired viscosity.
      <br/>
      The amount of ionizable salts used depends on the amount of active ingredients used in the compositions and can be adjusted according to the desires of the formulator.
      <br/>
      Typical levels of salts used to control the composition viscosity are from 20 to 20,000 parts per million (ppm), preferably from 20 to 11,000 ppm, by weight of the composition.
      <br/>
      Alkylene polyammonium salts can be incorporated into the composition to give viscosity control in addition to or in place of the water-soluble, ionizable salts above.
      <br/>
      In addition, these agents can act as scavengers, forming ion pairs with anionic detergent carried over from the main wash, in the rinse, and on the fabrics, and may improve softness performance.
      <br/>
      These agents may stabilize the viscosity over a broader range of temperature, especially at low temperatures, compared to the inorganic electrolytes.

      <br/>
      The level of water in the liquid carrier is preferably at least 50%, most preferably at least 60%, by weight of the carrier.
      <br/>
      Mixtures of water and low molecular weight, e.g., &lt;200, organic solvent, e.g., lower alcohols such as ethanol, propanol, isopropanol or butanol are useful as the carrier liquid.

      Detergent builders can optionally be included in the compositions herein to assist in controlling mineral hardness.
      <br/>
      Inorganic as well as organic builders can be used.

      <br/>
      Liquid formulations typically comprise from 5% to 50%, more typically 5% to 30%, by weight, of detergent builder.
      <br/>
      Granular formulations typically comprise from 1% to 80%, more typically from 5% to 50% by weight, of the detergent builder.

    <p num="108">
      Inorganic or P-containing detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates (exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta-phosphates), phosphonates, phytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesquicarbonates), sulphates, and aluminosilicates.
      <br/>
      However, non-phosphate builders are required in some locales.
      <br/>
      Importantly, the compositions herein function surprisingly well even in the presence of the so-called "weak" builders (as compared with phosphates) such as citrate, or in the so-called "underbuilt" situation that may occur with zeolite or layered silicate builders.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metal silicates, particularly those having a SiO2 :Na2 O ratio in the range 1.0:1 to 3.2:1 and layered silicates, such as the layered sodium silicates described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,839. NaSKS-6 is the trademark for a crystalline layered silicate marketed by Hoechst (commonly abbreviated herein as "SKS-6").
      <br/>
      Unlike zeolite builders, the Na SKS-6 silicate builder does not contain aluminum.
      <br/>
      NaSKS-6 has the delta-Na2 SiO5 morphology form of layered silicate.
      <br/>
      It can be prepared by methods such as those described in German DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043.
      <br/>
      SKS-6 is a highly preferred layered silicate for use herein, but other such layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSix O2x+1.yH2 O wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1.9 to 4, preferably 2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0 can be used herein.
      <br/>
      Various other layered silicates from Hoechst include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the alpha, beta and gamma forms.
      <br/>
      As noted above, the delta-Na2 SiO5 (NaSKS-6 form) is most preferred for use herein.
      <br/>
      Other silicates may also be useful such as for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crispening agent in granular formulations, as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.
      <br/>
      Examples of carbonate builders are the alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in German Patent Application No.2,321,001 published on Nov. 15, 1973.

    <p num="112">
      Useful aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are commercially available.
      <br/>
      These aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally-occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived.
      <br/>
      A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,985,669, Krummel, et al, issued Oct. 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite MAP and Zeolite X. In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula:

    <p num="113">Na12 �(AIO2)12 (SiO2)12 �.xH2 O</p>
    <p num="114">
      wherein x is from 20 to 30, especially 27.

    <p num="115">
      Organic detergent builders suitable for the purposes of the present invention include, but are not restricted to, a wide variety of polycarboxylate compounds.
      <br/>
      As used herein, "polycarboxylate" refers to compounds having a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates.
      <br/>
      Polycarboxylate builder can generally be added to the composition in acid form, but can also be added in the form of a neutralized salt.

    <p num="118">
      Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their biodegradability.
      <br/>
      Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicate builders.
      <br/>
      Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      Also suitable in the detergent compositions of the present invention are the 3,3-dicarboxy-oxa-1,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,566,984, Bush, issued Jan. 28, 1986. Useful succinic acid builders include the C5 -C20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof.
      <br/>
      A particularly preferred compound of this type is dodecenylsuccinic acid.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of succinate builders include: laurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like.

      Then, the white precipitate of pyridinium chloride was filtered off and the reaction mixture was washed with distiled water (3 * 150 ml), dried over MgSO4 and the solvent removed under reduced pressure, yielding a dark brown oil which is a mixture of dihydromyrcenyl bromoacetate (70 mole %) and dihydromyrcenol (30 mole %).
      <br/>
      The dihydromyrcenyl bromoacetate is separated as a colourless oil by distillation under reduce pressure (bp 106 (degree)  C./3 mm Hg).

    <p num="154">
      The synthesis of other alcoyl bromoacetate such as linalyl bromoacetate, phenoxanyl bromoacetate or geranyl bromoacetate was also made following the above synthesis example by replacing the dihydromyrcenol by the required alcohol, i.e. linalool, phenoxyethanol, or geraniol.
      <br/>
      For primary and tertiary alcohols the yield under such conditions are generally greater than 95%.

      <br/>
      The linalyl chloroacetate is separated as a colourless oil by distillation under reduce pressure (bp 104 (degree)  C./2 mm Hg).

      <br/>
      The solvent used was dichloromethane rather than toluene.
      <br/>
      The conditions of reaction were 2 h30 at room temperature and the reaction yielded a slightly brown oil which is about 95% pure linalyl chloroacetate.
      <br/>
      This can be purified even further by distillation under reduced pressure as above.
