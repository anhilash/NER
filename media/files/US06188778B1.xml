      The present invention measures traffic congestion by utilizing a video camera to capture images of vehicles travelling on a road and analyzing sample points that are assigned to different aspects of the images.
      <br/>
      For example, presence and movement sample points correspond to the expected location and motion of the vehicles respectively.
      <br/>
      The sample points adjacent to one another from either movement or congestion blocks.
      <br/>
      The blocks that have a ratio of movement sample points to all other sample points within the block greater than a predetermined level are moveable blocks.
      <br/>
      The remaining presence sample points in the image signify congestion sample points and form congestion blocks.
      <br/>
      Congestion blocks have a ratio of congestion sample points to all other sample points within the block greater than a predetermined level.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the state of traffic congestion is measured based upon the resultant movement and congestion blocks.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to method and apparatus for measuring a state of traffic congestion on a road on the basis of brightness levels of sample points which are set in a motion picture representing the road and vehicles coming and going on the road.
      <br/>
      The present invention also relates to image processing method and apparatus for setting sample points in an image and processing the image.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      There are a wide variety of systems for measuring a state of traffic congestion for the purpose of smoothing traffic on roads.
      <br/>
      Such traffic congestion measuring systems include two well known measuring systems, one of the two measuring systems being of a supersonic type and the other of the two measuring systems being of a loop-coil type.
      <br/>
      The supersonic type of traffic congestion measuring system adopts a supersonic sensor as means for sensing the presence and movement of vehicles, while the loop-coil type of traffic congestion measuring system adopts a loop-coil as means for sensing the presence and the movement of the vehicles.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The supersonic type of traffic congestion measuring system uses the supersonic sensor, which is positioned above the road at a predetermined height, to detect the presence and velocity of a passing vehicle.
      <br/>
      Based on results of the detection by the supersonic sensor, the state of traffic congestion is measured.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the loop-coil type of traffic congestion measuring system uses the loop-coil, which is buried under the road, to detect the presence and the velocity of the vehicle passing above the loop-coil on the basis of the variation in magnetism above the loop-coil caused by the passing vehicle.
      <br/>
      Based on results of the detection by the loop-coil, the state of traffic congestion is measured.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the supersonic sensor type and loop-coil type of traffic congestion measuring systems thus designed, the supersonic sensor and the loop-coil are merely operated to obtain information of only the vehicles lying directly under the supersonic sensor and directly above the loop-coil, respectively.
      <br/>
      In point of fact, the supersonic sensor type and the loop-coil type of traffic congestion measuring systems are merely operated to indirectly measure the state of traffic congestion on the basis of the number of the passing vehicles during a certain period or the velocities of sampled vehicles corresponding to extremely small part of the vehicles passing over the supersonic sensor and the loop-coil, respectively.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the supersonic sensor and the loop-coil of traffic congestion measuring systems have difficulty in automatically measuring, in real time, traffic congestion ranges with high accuracy.
      <br/>
      For instance, if the supersonic sensor type and loop-coil type of traffic congestion measuring systems are adopted for the purpose of controlling traffic signals in accordance with the length of a traffic queue extending from an intersection, a drawback is encountered in that the supersonic sensor type and loop-coil type of traffic congestion measuring systems have difficulty in controlling the traffic signals so as to quickly relieve the traffic congestion.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      There are also two traffic congestion measuring systems adopting video cameras, which are superior to the supersonic sensor type and loop-coil type of traffic congestion measuring systems in that the state of traffic congestion is measured in real time with high accuracy.
      <br/>
      One of the traffic congestion measuring systems is disclosed in "INPACTS: A New TV Image Processing System for Monitoring Traffic Conditions," by Wootton Jeffreys CONSULTANTS or European Patent publication No. 0403193. In the disclosed measuring system, an image of a road taken by a video camera is divided into a plurality of blocks for each traffic lane.
      <br/>
      The size of each block is roughly equal in length to each of the vehicles represented in the image.
      <br/>
      By processing the image, the blocks are classified into three different block groups.
      <br/>
      The first block group includes blocks in which no vehicle is detected.
      <br/>
      The second block group includes blocks in which a moving vehicle is detected.
      <br/>
      The third block group includes blocks in which a stationary vehicle is detected.
      <br/>
      According to the arrangement of the three different type blocks, the state of traffic congestion is measured indicating, for instance, conditions substantially stationary, slowly moving, and smoothly moving.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Other traffic congestion measuring systems are disclosed in Kitamura et al., "Traffic Congestion Measuring System Using Image Processing", Annual Conference sponsored by The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan, Industry Application Society, 1991.
      <br/>
      The traffic congestion measuring system operates in a manner which comprising the steps of abstracting three different feature values representative of the density of vehicles, the movement quantities of vehicles and the brightness of a road surface, respectively, from images taken by video camera, inputting the feature values into an input layer partially forming a neural network, calculating an output value stepwise varied between "0" and "1" by 0.2, and detecting, on the basis of the output value, the state of traffic congestion.
      <br/>
      The state of traffic congestion is any of five different conditions; a first condition that there is no traffic, a second condition that the vehicles are smoothly moving, a third condition that the vehicles are moving but crowded, a fourth condition that there is produced a slight traffic congestion, and fifth condition that there is produced a serious traffic congestion.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The conventional traffic congestion measuring systems using the video camera, however, also encounter drawbacks.
      <br/>
      In the former traffic congestion measuring system adopting the video camera, a correlation of the arrangement pattern of the blocks classified into three types and the state of traffic congestion in each of measurement points is required to be previously learned.
      <br/>
      In addition, the former traffic congestion measuring system must perform a process of dividing each of the traffic lanes into the blocks.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the traffic congestion occurring over two or more traffic lanes cannot be detected and, as a result, the state of traffic congestion cannot be measured with accuracy.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the size of the vehicle represented in the image becomes smaller as a distance from the video camera to the vehicle becomes larger.
      <br/>
      The block size is, therefore, adjusted with difficulty to the size of vehicle spaced apart from the video camera at a long distance.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the former traffic congestion measuring system adopting the video camera cannot measure the state of traffic congestion over a long distance.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the traffic congestion measuring system adopting the video camera, the traffic congestion measuring system is limited in forming the neural network based on a large amount of data for the sake of learning.
      <br/>
      The process of forming the neural network takes much time and labor and is a difficult task.
      <br/>
      In addition, the neural network must be re-formed whenever road circumstances are changed.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the whole image is processed in the lump in order to measure the state of traffic congestion, so that detailed traffic information for each part of the image cannot be detected.
      <br/>
      The detailed traffic information includes, for instance, information pertain to traffic queue length expressed as "there is a traffic congestion of y meter length extending from point X1 to point X2 on the road".
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The above traffic congestion measuring systems which use the video cameras encounter the foregoing drawbacks and, for this reason, are put to practical use with difficulty.
      <br/>
      In the view of the foregoing surroundings, the present invention is made and has an objective of providing a traffic congestion measuring method and apparatus capable of reducing the previous learning, detecting the traffic congestion traversing two or more traffic lanes, stably measuring the state of traffic congestion independently of the changes in circumstances such as changes of measurement points and periods, weather and traffic quantity, and detecting the traffic queue length.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The present invention has another objective of providing a traffic congestion measuring method and apparatus capable of accurately measuring the state of traffic congestion produced by a group of vehicles which are moving at a speed lower than 20 km/h, and also suitable for measurement in a highway or an expressway, in addition to the foregoing capabilities of the method and apparatus provided for the purpose of attaining the first object of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="12">The present invention has a further objective of providing an image processing method and apparatus that utilize processing techniques adopted by the foregoing traffic congestion measuring method and apparatus provided for the purpose of attaining the first object of the present invention.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="36">&lt;First Embodiment&gt;</p>
    <p num="37">Referring to FIGS. 1 to 19 of the drawings, a first preferred embodiment of a traffic control system adopting traffic congestion measuring method and apparatus according to the present invention will be described in detail hereinafter.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The traffic control system is shown in FIG. 1 and includes video cameras 11 to 14, traffic congestion measuring units 21 to 24, traffic signals 31 to 34, signal control units 41 to 44 and a repeating installation unit 50.
      <br/>
      All of these units and devices are located in the neighborhood of an intersection IS.
      <br/>
      The traffic control system further comprises a central control unit 60 that is located in a traffic control center built in remotely spaced relationship to the intersection IS.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the video cameras 11 to 14 are spaced apart from a road surface near the intersection IS, for example, at 10 meters, and set to shoot a road area Y covering three traffic lanes and each extending from a certain position in the neighborhood of the intersection over a distance of 150 meters.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, each of the video cameras 11 to 14 is positioned on the downstream side of each of the roads and directed toward the upstream side of each of the roads.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The traffic congestion measuring units 21 to 24 are designed to measure not only traffic quantity but also traffic congestion ranges or traffic queue lengths on the basis of the number, the velocities and the types of vehicles that are approaching the intersection IS.
      <br/>
      Each of the traffic congestion measuring units 21 to 24 is shown in FIG. 3 and includes a CPU 2, an image memory 3, an input device 4, a display unit 5, a data storage unit 6, a transmitting unit 7, a RAM (Random Access Memory) 8 and a ROM (Read-only Memory) 9.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      When each of the video cameras 11 to 14 are operated to obtain image data, the image data are transmitted to the CPU 2 of each of the traffic congestion measuring units 21 to 24.
      <br/>
      The image data is further transmitted from the CPU 2 and stored in the image memory 3.
      <br/>
      The ROM 9 previously stores various programs to be read and executed by the CPU 2.
      <br/>
      When the programs are executed by the CPU 2, the RAM 8 serves as a work area and outputs the required image data from the image memory 3.
      <br/>
      Based on the required image data, various calculations are carried out and, finally, the following measurement results pertinent to the state of traffic congestion are calculated.
      <br/>
      The calculation values produced during the execution of the programs are temporarily stored in the image memory 3.
      <br/>
      The measurement results pertinent to the state of traffic congestion are transmitted to the display unit 5, the data storage unit 6 and the transmitting unit 7.
      <br/>
      The display unit 5 displays the inputted measurement results pertinent to the state of traffic congestion on its own screen.
      <br/>
      The data storage unit 6 is operated to store therein the inputted measurement results pertinent to the state of traffic congestion.
      <br/>
      The transmitting unit 7 transmits the inputted measurement results pertinent to the state of traffic congestion to the central control unit 60 in the traffic control center shown in FIG. 1 by way of the repeating installation unit 50.
      <br/>
      The input device 4 serves as an input means for allowing set values and threshold values to be inputted therein and allowing the present values to be replaced with new values.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Returning back to FIG. 1 of the drawings, the central control unit 60 in the traffic control center is adapted to transmit signal control patterns, which are produced on the basis of the measurement results of the traffic congestion measuring units 21 to 24, to the signal control units 41 to 44 through the repeating installation unit 50.
      <br/>
      If, for instance, the traffic congestion measuring units 21 and 23 receiving the image data from the video cameras 11 and 13 detects traffic congestion ranges respectively having lengths which are longer than those by the traffic congestion measuring units 22 and 24 receiving the image data from the video cameras 12 and 14, the central control unit 60 is operated to transmit, to the signal control units 41 to 44, the signal control patterns indicating that green light periods in the signal control units 31 and 32 are longer than those in the signal control units 33 and 34, thereby relieving the traffic congestion on the roads shot by the video cameras 11, and 13.
    </p>
    <p num="42">The traffic congestion measuring method performed by the traffic congestion measuring units thus constructed is described hereinlater with reference to FIG. 4 showing a flowchart and formed by steps S1 through S8.</p>
    <p num="43">
      In step S1, a plurality of sample points are set in a series of the images taken by the video camera.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 6, assuming that the video camera takes an image 71 the sample points are denoted by ".circle-solid.". In step S2, the sample points, which are set in the image taken at time tn and at each of which the vehicle is expected to be present, are detected as presence sample points.
      <br/>
      In step S3, the sample points, which are set in the image taken at the time tn and at each of which the vehicle in motion is expected to be present, are detected as movement sample points.
      <br/>
      In step S4, rectangular blocks each formed by the sample points adjacent to one another are detected as movement blocks.
      <br/>
      Each of the detected movement blocks includes the movement sample points.
      <br/>
      A ratio of the movement sample points to all of the sample points contained in each of the movement blocks is larger than a predetermined level.
      <br/>
      In step S5, the presence sample points which are excluded from the movement blocks are detected as congestion sample points.
      <br/>
      In step S6, rectangular blocks each formed by the sample points adjacent to one another are detected as congestion blocks.
      <br/>
      Each of the detected congestion blocks includes the congestion sample points.
      <br/>
      A ratio of the congestion sample points to all of the sample points contained in each of the congestion blocks is larger than a predetermined level.
      <br/>
      In step S7, the state of traffic congestion in the measurement area at the time tn is measured depending upon the congestion blocks.
      <br/>
      In step S8, n is replaced n+1 and the control is returned from step S8 to step S2.
      <br/>
      Note that n is a positive integer and that .vertline.tn+1 -tn.vertline. is constant.
      <br/>
      Steps S2 through S7 are repeated at regular time intervals.
    </p>

      FIG. 5 summarily shows relationships between results of the calculation and the detection in steps S1 through S7.
      <br/>
      The results of the calculation and the detection will be apparent from the following detailed explanations of steps S1 through S7.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Step S1 of setting the sample points is described in detail hereinlater.</p>
    <p num="46">
      The image 71 shown in FIG. 6 has a lower portion representing an area portion near the video camera and an upper portion representing an area portion remote from the video camera.
      <br/>
      The image 71 represents three traffic lanes with the vehicles as rectangles shown by solid lines.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 6, the sample points on each line perpendicular to a direction in which the road extends are positioned in the image to correspond to actual locations aligned at regular actual space intervals on the road.
      <br/>
      The reason why the sample points are thus positioned is that distortions in each line perpendicular to the direction in which the road extends is small and that a distance in the image between two sample points aligned on the line perpendicular to the direction in which the road represented in the image extends can be transformed into an actual distance with ease.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      On the other hand, the sample points on each line parallel to the direction in which the road extends are aligned at space intervals.
      <br/>
      The space interval between two adjoining sample points aligned on each line parallel to the direction becomes smaller as two actual locations on the road respectively corresponding to the two adjoining sample points are more remote from the video camera.
      <br/>
      The reason why the sample points on each line parallel to the direction in which the road extends are thus aligned is described below.
      <br/>
      In an image area corresponding to an actual area near to the video camera, the image of the vehicle is large.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the travel condition of the vehicle can be detected with ease even if the sample points are sparsely arranged.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, in an image area corresponding to an actual area remote from the video camera, the image of the vehicle is small.
      <br/>
      For this reason, it is difficult to detect the vehicle's travel condition if sample points are sparsely arranged.
      <br/>
      For example, in a faraway image area corresponding to an area most remote from the video camera, the space interval between two sample points aligned in a direction in which the vehicle is travelling is corresponding to that between two adjoining picture elements in the image.
      <br/>
      In the image areas nearer to the video camera, as two actual locations corresponding to the two sample points are nearer to the video camera, the space interval between the two sample points becomes larger to the extent that the travel condition of the vehicle can be detected.
      <br/>
      In this case, the space intervals of the sample points may be determined depending upon a predetermine limit value indicative of the total number of the sample points.
      <br/>
      By determining the space intervals of the sample points in this way, not only can be detected the travel conditions of the vehicles remote from the video camera, but the required processing time can be reduced.
      <br/>
      When the measuring system ensures that the detection capability in the measurement area most remote from the video camera is increased to the upper limit level indigenous to the input image, and when the total number of the sample points are restricted, the measuring system is capable of enhancing the detection process in speed and performing the detection process without expensive specific hardware.
      <br/>
      If the resolution of the video camera in the measuring system is set to a constant value, other video cameras having various resolutions can be adopted with ease.
      <br/>
      When the sample points are set, the data storage unit 6 stores, in a distance table formed in its own memory area, distance values and space intervals.
      <br/>
      The distance values are indicative of an actual route distance along each traffic lane from the video camera to an actual location on the road corresponding to each of the sample points.
      <br/>
      The space intervals are indicative of the actual space interval between the two adjoining sample points aligned along each traffic lane.
    </p>
    <p num="48">The process of detecting the presence sample points performed in step S2 shown in FIG. 4 is described in detail hereinlater with reference to FIG. 7 showing a flowchart formed by steps S2a through S2g.</p>
    <p num="49">
      In step S2a, threshold levels TH1 are utilized for binarizing brightness level of each of the sample points.
      <br/>
      The binarization manner is determined in accordance with distance values that are indicative of an actual route distance from the video camera to an actual location on the road corresponding to a position of each of the sample points in the image.
      <br/>
      In step S2b, a sample point image represented by only picture elements corresponding to the sample points is formed.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 shows an example of the sample point image.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 8, the sample point image is formed by mapping the sample points in the image at the time tn into a rectangular coordinate system.
      <br/>
      The sample points forming the sample point image are stored in the form of a two-dimensional data format corresponding to the arrangement of the sample points shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Each of the brightness levels of the picture elements corresponding to the sample points is represented in the form of 8 bit data format.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Step S2b leads to step S2c in which a difference image is calculated by calculating brightness difference values which are each indicative of a difference in brightness level between each of the sample points in the sample point image and each of the sample points in a criterion brightness image corresponding in position to each other.
      <br/>
      The criterion brightness image used in the initial control flow shown in FIG. 7 may represent a background with respect to the vehicles and be taken by the video camera on the same condition as the initial measurement.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the firstly formed criterion brightness image may represent no vehicles within the measurement area.
      <br/>
      However, the most preferable criterion brightness image can be scarcely formed because of the fact that the brightness level in the image is varied every minute in accordance with the weather and the elapsed time.
      <br/>
      Practically, the criterion brightness image may be an image having picture element data approximate to that of the most preferable image representing no vehicles even if the image represents several vehicles.
      <br/>
      Similarly to the aforesaid sample point image, the criterion brightness image is represented by only picture elements corresponding to the sample points, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="51">In step S2d, the criterion brightness image which is utilized for calculating the difference image with respect to the sample point image at time tn+1 is renewed by the following equation on the basis of the difference image calculated in step S2c.</p>
    <p num="52">Bn+1 =Bn + ETA  * (Xn -Bn)  (i)</p>
    <p num="53">
      wherein Xn is a brightness level of each of sample points forming the sample point image taken at time tn.
      <br/>
      Bn is a brightness level of each of sample points forming the criterion brightness image which is utilized for calculating the difference image with respect to the sample point image taken at time tn.
      <br/>
      Bn+1 is a brightness level which is utilized for calculating the difference image with respect to the sample point image taken at time tn+1.  ETA  is a variable coefficient decreased in proportion as .vertline.Xn -Bn.vertline. becomes large and as traffic congestion level on the road is increased.
      <br/>
      The reason why  ETA  is inversely proportional to .vertline.Xn -Bn.vertline. is that a possibility that the vehicle is present is increased in proportion as the variation in brightness is increased.
      <br/>
      In this case,  ETA  is set for each of the sample points.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in order to prevent the brightness level of the vehicle caught by the traffic congestion from being inputted into the system,  ETA  is decreased in proportion to the increase in the traffic congestion level on the road.
      <br/>
      In this case,  ETA  is set for each of the traffic lanes or each of predetermined areas in the image.
      <br/>
      The traffic congestion level is determined depending upon traffic congestion ranges described below.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Because the criterion brightness image is renewed in accordance with the equation (i) described hereinbefore, the criterion brightness image can be automatically varied in accordance with the variation in weather and the variation of the sunlight due to elapsed-time.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the criterion brightness image is renewed in accordance with the equation (i), "Xn -Bn " calculated in step S2c can be appropriated for the renewal of the criterion brightness image, thereby making it possible to reduce the calculations in quantity.
      <br/>
      If the calculation is increased, the criterion brightness image is renewed by another equation describe as follows:
      <br/>
      Bn+1 =Bn + ETA  * (Xn+1 -Bn)  (ii)
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In step S2e, the difference image is spatially differentiated with so-called Sobel operators.
      <br/>
      Step S2e is followed by step S2f in which each of the differentiation values of the sample points in the differentiated difference image is binarized or thresholded with each of the threshold levels TH1 determined in step S2a.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the sample points in the differentiated difference image each has a level of "0" or "1".
      <br/>
      In step S2g, the sample points having the level of "1" are detected as the presence sample points because of the fact that, on each of the sample points having the level of "1", the vehicle is expected to be present.
      <br/>
      The arrangement of the presence sample points thus detected is, by way of example, shown in FIG. 9.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Each of the threshold levels TH1 may be determined in step S2a as follows.
      <br/>
      The smaller of the threshold levels TH1 used for judging each of the sample points becomes smaller as an actual route distance from the video camera to a location on the road corresponding to a position of each of the sample points in the image becomes larger.
      <br/>
      The reason why the threshold levels TH1 are thus set is that the image representing an actual area remote from the video camera grows dimmer in comparison with that representing an actual area in the neighborhood of the video camera and accordingly that a difference in brightness between the vehicles and the background is decreased.
      <br/>
      Because each of the threshold levels is set for each of the sample points in accordance with the actual route distance from the video camera to the actual location on the road corresponding to the position of each of the sample points, the presence sample points in any position can be detected on an accurate level with one another.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The process of detecting the movement sample points performed in step S3 shown in FIG. 4 is described in detail hereinlater with reference to FIG. 10 showing a flowchart formed by steps S3a through S3m.
      <br/>
      The process will be understood with ease, provided that FIGS. 11 and 12 are referred to in each step.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      In step S3a, the sample point image is divided into a plurality of image zones, the number of which is designated by "M".
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, the sample point image is divided into three different image zones consisting of a faraway image zone which corresponds to an actual area remote from the video camera, a neighboring image zone which corresponds to an actual area near to the video camera, an intermediate image zone located between the faraway image zone and the neighboring image zone.
      <br/>
      M is, therefore, equal to 3 in the present embodiment.
      <br/>
      Step S3b determines time intervals  ALPHA m and  BETA m that are used for judging the mth image zone and threshold levels TH1 and TH2 that are used for the following binarization process.
      <br/>
      Note that the time intervals  ALPHA m and  BETA m are positive,  ALPHA 1 &lt; ALPHA 2 &lt; ALPHA 3, and  BETA 1 &lt; BETA 2 &lt; BETA 3.
      <br/>
      The reason why the time intervals  ALPHA m and  BETA m are thus determined is described hereinlater.
      <br/>
      In appearance, the velocity of the vehicle represented in an image zone corresponding to an actual area near to the video camera is higher than that of the vehicles represented in an image zone corresponding to an actual area remote from the video camera.
      <br/>
      For this reason, in the image zone near to the video camera, the velocity of the vehicle can be detected with easy by comparing the sample point images taken at different times between which there is a short time interval.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the time intervals  ALPHA m and  BETA m used for selecting the sample points in the neighboring image zone corresponding to the actual area near to the video camera may be short.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the faraway zone corresponding to the actual area remote from the video camera, the velocity of the vehicle can be scarcely detected by comparing the sample point images taken at different times between which there is a short time interval.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the time intervals  ALPHA m and  BETA m use for selecting the sample points in the faraway image zone corresponding to the actual area remote from the video camera may be long.
      <br/>
      The time intervals  ALPHA m and  BETA m may be different from each other however, the time intervals  ALPHA m and  BETA m are preferably equal to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      When step S3b leads to step S3c, the sample point images are formed from the images taken at times tn, tn - ALPHA m and tn + BETA m. Step S3d calculates a first difference image zone indicative of a difference in brightness between the mth image zone of the sample point image taken at the time tn and the mth image zone of the sample point image taken at the time tn - ALPHA m. The first difference image zone is binarized with the threshold level TH1 determined in step S3b to calculate a first feature abstractive image zone in step S3e.
      <br/>
      This results in the fact that each of the sample points in the first feature abstractive image zone has a level of "0" or "1".
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Step S3f calculates a second difference image zone indicative of a difference in brightness between the mth image zone of the sample point image taken at the time tn and the mth image zone of the sample point image taken at the time tn + BETA m. Step S3f leads to step S3g in which the second difference image zone is binarized with the threshold level TH2 determined in step S3b to calculate a second feature abstractive image zone.
      <br/>
      This means that each of the sample points in the second feature abstractive image zone has a level of "0" or "1".
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      By virtue of steps S3h and S3i following step S3g, steps S3b through S3g are repeated until m is equal to M. Accordingly, three first feature abstractive image zones and three second feature abstractive image zones are calculated.
      <br/>
      In step S3j, all of the first feature abstractive image zones are combined to form a first feature abstractive image.
      <br/>
      Likewise, in step S3k, all of the second feature abstractive image zones are combined to form a second feature abstractive image.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      In step S3l, a product image is formed by calculating a product of the first feature abstractive image and the second feature abstractive image.
      <br/>
      The sample points each having the level indicated by "1" are detected as the movement sample points in step S3m.
      <br/>
      FIG. 12 shows the relationships between the product image and the first and second feature abstractive images.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The reason why the movement sample points are detected on the basis of the sample point image taken at the time tn and the two sample point images respectively taken before and after the time tn is described below.
      <br/>
      If the movement sample points are detected on the basis of the sample point image taken at the time tn and only one of two sample point images taken before and after the time tn, the sample points indicative of the moving vehicle not represented in the sample point image at the time tn remain in the feature abstractive image as will be understood from the first or second feature abstractive image shown in FIG. 12. This means that the movement sample points cannot be detected on the basis of only one of the first and second feature abstractive images.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      If the time intervals  ALPHA m and  BETA m are appropriately controlled in the process of detecting the movement sample points, it is possible that the sample points indicative of the low speed moving vehicle, which is moving at 20 km/h or lower, are prevented from being detected as the movement sample points.
      <br/>
      The present embodiment, therefore, can be applied to measurement for the traffic congestion caused by the low speed vehicles by appropriately controlling the time intervals  ALPHA m and  BETA m.

      In step S4a, a calculation start point is set to the sample point located at the top left-hand corner of the sample point image.

      It is assumed that candidate blocks which might be detected as the movement blocks are rectangular blocks each partially forming the sample point image and formed by a plurality of sample points adjacent to one another and arranged in the form of a matrix array.
      <br/>
      In step S4b, the size of each of the candidate blocks and a threshold level TH1 utilized for binarizing the sample points in each of the candidate blocks are determined in accordance with an actual route distance from the video camera to an actual location on the road corresponding to a position of each of the candidate blocks in the image.
      <br/>
      Step S4c calculates a ratio of the movement sample points included in the candidate block to all of the sample points contained in the same candidate block.
      <br/>
      In step S4d, a judgment is made upon whether the ratio of the movement sample points to all of the sample point in the candidate block is larger than the threshold level TH1 determined in step S4b.
      <br/>
      If the answer in step S4d is an affirmative "YES", step S4d leads to step S4e in which the candidate block is detected as the movement block.

      If the answer in step S4d is a negative "NO", step S4d leads to step S4f.
      <br/>

      In step S7b, the traffic congestion ranges per traffic lane is transformed to actual traffic queue lengths on the road with reference to the foregoing distance table.
      <br/>
      In step S7c, the abrupt variations of the traffic congestion ranges in position are eliminated as noises on the basis of a profile indicating the positions of past traffic congestion.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the positions of the current traffic congestion are corrected through smoothing process.
      <br/>
      As a result, the traffic congestion ranges are corrected and outputted as conclusive measurement results.

      According to the aforesaid embodiment, not all of the picture elements contained in the image but the sample points corresponding to part of the picture elements contained in the image are processed, so that data produced in the calculation process can be extremely decreased in quantity.
      <br/>
      Hence, the traffic congestion measuring apparatus can be simplified in hardware and reduced in cost.
      <br/>
      In addition, the traffic congestion measuring apparatus can process the image at high speed and, accordingly, measure the state of traffic congestion in real time.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the measurement result can be outputted within one or two seconds, i.e., (the longest time interval)+(processing time).
      <br/>
      The present invention is, therefore, extremely suitable for the present embodiment of the traffic control system designed to control the green or yellow light of the traffic signals.
      <br/>
      As will be appreciated from the foregoing description of the embodiment, it is possible that the traffic congestion measuring apparatus starts to measure the state of the traffic congestion without the previously learning and with accuracy immediately after the setup of the apparatus is completed.
      <br/>
      In addition, the traffic congestion measuring apparatus can be stably operated to measure the state of the traffic congestion independently of the variations in circumstances such as locations, time, weather and traffic densities.
      <br/>
      The traffic congestion measuring apparatus can also measure the traffic queue length with ease.

    <p num="82">
      Each of the various parameters serving as criterion levels in the various judgments is varied in accordance with an actual route distance from the video camera to a location on the road corresponding to a position of each of the sample points, so that the resulting measurement is extremely enhanced in accuracy.
      <br/>
      Since the various parameters are automatically determined in accordance with the actual route distance from the video camera to the location on the road corresponding to position of each of the sample points, the traffic control system is managed with great facility.
      <br/>
      There is no need for the traffic congestion measuring apparatus to consider the traffic lanes until the final output timing.
      <br/>
      The vehicle which is present over both of two traffic lanes can be detected as a vehicle caught up in the traffic congestion, so that the traffic congestion measuring apparatus is stably operated to measure the state of the traffic congestion.
      <br/>
      Based on the detected movement sample points and the detected congestion sample points, a moving vehicle and a vehicle caught up in the traffic congestion are detected as the movement block and the congestion block, respectively.
      <br/>
      Hence, the movement sample point and the congestion sample point respectively excluded from the movement block and the congestion block are eliminated as noises with facility.
      <br/>
      When a plurality of video cameras and a plurality of traffic congestion measuring units are arranged along the road and when the adjoining video cameras spaced apart from each other at a distance covered by the video camera, the traffic control system can be operated to measure the state of traffic congestion over a long distance range.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, the state of traffic congestion in the whole measurement area is not estimated from measurement results in a local part of the measurement area but directly measured, thereby enabling the traffic control system to quickly detect various accidents such as traffic accidents or vehicular accidents.

    <p num="113">Referring to FIGS. 20 to 45 of the drawings, a second preferred embodiment of a traffic control system adopting traffic congestion measuring method and apparatus according to the present invention will be described in detail hereinafter.</p>
    <p num="114">
      The second embodiment of the traffic control system is shown in FIG. 20 as comprising video cameras 81, traffic congestion measuring units 82, an information display board 91, a display control unit 92 and a central control unit 100 that is located in a traffic control center.
      <br/>
      The video cameras 81 are positioned above a highway in spaced relationship to each other at a certain distance.

      This means that each of the video cameras 81 is intended to shoot rear side portions of the vehicles.

      Because the video cameras are thus fixed in the present embodiment, the traffic control system is able to measure the tail position of the traffic congestion range with accuracy.
      <br/>
      If, reversely, the traffic control system is intended to measure the head position of the traffic congestion range with accuracy, the video camera may be directed from the downstream side of the highway toward the upstream side of the highway, i.e., the video camera may be fixed so as to shoot front side portions of the vehicles.

      In the traffic flow measurement area F, the traffic congestion measuring unit is operated not only to detect the vehicles which are present in the area F but also to detect the number, the velocities, the lengths and the types of the vehicles which crosses a sense line DL.
      <br/>

      In step P4b, a judgment is made upon whether a brightness difference value of the mth sample point on the kth sample line is larger than the positive threshold level TH1 or not.

      The reason why the positive threshold value TH1 and the negative threshold value TH2 are thus determined is that an image area corresponding to an actual area remote from the video camera grows dimmer in comparison with that near to the video camera and, consequently, that a difference in brightness between the vehicle and the background represented in the image is decreased.
      <br/>
      Because the positive and negative threshold values TH1 and TH2 utilized for judging each of the sample lines are determined in accordance with the actual route distance from the video camera to the location on the road corresponding to the position of each of the sample lines in the image, all of the presence sample lines can be detected on an accuracy level with one another.
      <br/>
      The positive integer threshold level TH3 may be determined in step P4a as described below.
      <br/>
      The positive integer threshold value TH3 used for judging each of the sample lines becomes smaller as the actual route distance from the video camera to the location on the road corresponding to the position of each of the sample lines becomes larger, i.e., as a difference in brightness between the adjoining sample points on the sample line becomes smaller.

      <br/>
      The correction process based on the arrangement of the difference sample lines is intended to eliminating the presence sample lines which are detected by mistaking shadows of the vehicles and buildings for the vehicles.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the difference sample lines are simply detected depending upon a difference in brightness between the sample point image taken at the time tn and the criterion brightness image, so that image areas representing the shadows of the vehicles and the shadows of the buildings suddenly produced due to a sharp variation of sunlight are liable to be detected as the presence sample lines.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the presence sample lines mistakenly detected owing to the shadows of the vehicles and buildings are required to be corrected on the basis of the arrangement of the difference sample lines.

      The reason why the line groups including no edge sample line are required to be detected is described below.
      <br/>
      In general, edges in the image areas representing shadows can be scarcely detected.
      <br/>
      In addition, brightness levels of the sample points positioned in the image areas representing shadows are relatively small.
      <br/>
      As a result, no edge sample line is usually detected in the image areas representing shadows.

      In step P9b, a threshold level TH1 used for judging the kth sample line is determined on the basis of an actual route distance from the video camera to a location on the road corresponding to a position of the kth sample line.
      <br/>
      In step P9c, the movement sample points on the kth sample line are counted.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      Step P9c is followed by step P9d in which a judgment is made upon whether the counted number of the movement sample points exceeds the threshold level TH1 or not.
      <br/>
      If the answer in step P9d is an affirmative "YES", step P9d leads to step P9e in which the kth sample line is detected as the movement sample line.
      <br/>
      If the answer in step P9d is a negative "NO", step P9d leads to step P9f.
      <br/>
      Steps P9f and P9g cause steps P9b through P9e to be repeated until k is equal to K. The repetition of steps P9b through P9e has the effect of detecting all of the movement sample lines contained in one of the traffic lanes within the measurement area.

    <p num="168">
      The threshold level TH1 in step P9b may be determined as follows.
      <br/>
      The threshold level TH1 for judging each of the sample lines may become smaller as an actual route distance from the video camera to a location on the road corresponding to a position of each of the sample lines becomes larger.
      <br/>
      If the threshold level TH1 is thus varied in accordance with the position of each sample line, the movement sample lines in any position can be detected on an accurate level with one another independently of the actual route distance from the video camera to the location on the road corresponding to the position of each of the sample lines.

      An example of the process of correcting the presence sample lines performed in step P10 of FIG. 22 in accordance with the arrangement of the movement sample lines will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to FIG. 33 showing a flowchart formed by steps P10a through P10g.
      <br/>
      The correction process based on the arrangement of the movement sample lines is performed with the intention of compensating the presence sample lines which are omitted in steps P7a through P7f shown in FIG. 29 and which are located within an image area representing a vehicle body.
      <br/>
      If, more specifically, there is a vehicle on the road having a body image which forms a small contrast with the criterion brightness image and within which the variation in brightness is small, the presence of the vehicle can be scarcely detected as the difference sample lines or edge sample lines.
      <br/>
      The omitted detection cannot be compensated through the foregoing steps P7a to P7f.
      <br/>
      Because there is a possibility that the presence of the vehicle thus omitted can be detected as the movement sample lines, the omitted present sample lines are compensated on the basis of the arrangement of the movement sample lines.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      In step P10a, threshold levels TH1 and TH2 for judging the kth and (k+1)th presence sample lines are determined depending upon at least one of two actual route distances, one of the two actual route distances being from the video camera to a location on the road corresponding to a position of the kth presence sample line in the image, and the other of the two actual route distances being from the video camera to a location on the road corresponding to a position of the (k+1)th presence sample line in the image.
      <br/>
      Note that TH1&lt;TH2 and that the threshold level TH1 in step P10a may be equal to that in step P7a shown in FIG. 29. If both the threshold levels TH1 are equal to each other, an object of the compensation through steps P10a to P10g can be limited to the omitted presence sample lines which cannot be compensated through steps P7a to P7f, thereby making it possible to prevent useless correction processes from being performed and prevent essential correction processes from being omitted.

      Step P10b counts the sample lines between the kth and (k+1)th presence sample lines.
      <br/>
      In step P10c, a judgment is made upon whether the counted number of the sample lines is equal to or larger than the threshold level TH1 or not and smaller than the threshold level TH2 or not.
      <br/>
      If the answer in step P10c is an affirmative "YES", step P10c leads to step P10d.
      <br/>
      If the answer in step P10c is a negative "NO", step P10c leads to step P10f.

      Step P10c leads to step P10d in which a judgment is made upon whether there is at least one movement sample line between the kth and (k+1)th presence sample lines or not.

      If the answer in step P10d is an affirmative "YES", step P10d leads to step P10e.
      <br/>
      In step P10e, the sample lines interposed between the kth and (k+1)th presence sample lines and comprising the movement sample line are newly detected as the presence sample lines and added to the previously detected presence sample lines.
      <br/>
      If the answer in step P10d is a negative "NO", step P10d leads to step P10f.
      <br/>
      By virtue of steps P10f and P10g, steps P10a through P10e are repeated until k is equal to K. The repetition of steps P10a through P10e has the effect of correcting all of the presence sample lines in one of the traffic lanes located within the measurement area, on the basis of the arrangement of the movement sample lines.

      The presence sample lines and the movement sample line obtained in steps P8 and P9 are positioned as shown in FIG. 34(a).

      <br/>
      There is no sample line between any two adjoining presence sample lines of the first or uppermost through the seventh presence sample lines.
      <br/>
      There are three sample lines between the seventh and eighth presence sample lines, i.e., in a range denoted by "L7".
      <br/>
      There is no sample line between any two adjoining presence sample lines of the eighth through tenth presence sample lines.
      <br/>
      There are six sample lines between the tenth and eleventh presence sample lines, i.e., in a range denoted by L8.
      <br/>
      There is no sample line between any two adjoining presence sample lines of the eleventh through fourteenth presence sample lines.
      <br/>
      In the meantime, there is one movement sample line in the range L7 and there is no movement sample line in the range L8.
      <br/>
      If, therefore, the threshold level TH1 is determined to be equal to 3 and be constant and threshold level TH2 is determined to be equal to 5 and be constant, the sample lines in the range L7 are newly detected as the presence sample lines as shown in FIGS. 34(a) and 34(b).
    </p>
    <p num="174">
      In step P10a, the threshold levels TH1 and TH2 may be determined to be equal to the number of the sample lines corresponding to a quarter and a half, respectively, of the length of an average vehicle represented in the image.
      <br/>
      As a result, the threshold levels TH1 and TH2 used for judging the sample lines between the kth and (k+1)th presence sample lines may become smaller as an actual route distance from the video camera to a location on the road corresponding to a position of the kth or (k+1)th of the presence sample line becomes larger.
      <br/>
      The reason is that the vehicle represented in the image becomes smaller as an actual route distance from the video camera to the vehicle becomes larger.
      <br/>
      While, the threshold levels TH1 and TH2 may become larger as the actual route distance from the video camera to the location on the road corresponding to the position of the kth or (k+1)th of the presence sample line becomes smaller.
      <br/>
      The reason is that the vehicle represented in the image becomes larger as the actual route distance from the video camera to the vehicle becomes smaller.
      <br/>
      If the threshold levels TH1 and TH2 are determined in this way, the omitted presence sample lines can be newly detected on an accuracy level with one another independently of the actual route distance from the video camera.

      FIG. 35 shows the mesh sections into which the measurement area divided in step P11 shown in FIG. 22. Each of the mesh sections may become larger in longitudinal length as an actual route distance from the video camera to a location on the road corresponding to a position of each of the mesh sections in the image becomes smaller.
      <br/>
      If the size of each of the mesh sections is thus determined depending upon the actual route distance from the video camera to the location on the road corresponding to the position of each of the mesh sections, the mesh sections respectively represents actual road sections which are substantially equal in size to one another.

      The spatial density of the mesh section denoted by M1 is 33%, the spatial densities of the mesh sections respectively denoted by M2, M3 and M4 are 100%, the spatial density of the mesh section denoted by M5 is 75%, the spatial density of the mesh section denoted by M6 is 0% and the spatial density of the mesh section denoted by M7 is 80%.

      In step P14 of FIG. 22, the inter vehicle gaps of the vehicles are calculated as follows.

      The inter vehicle gaps of the vehicles can be scarcely measured directly depending upon the image information from the video camera.
      <br/>
      For this reason, in practice the velocities of the vehicles or the number of the passing vehicles per predetermined time are substituted for the inter vehicle gaps because of the fact that the velocities of the vehicle or the number of the passing vehicles per predetermined time are expected to be in proportion to the inter vehicle gaps.

      In step P15 of FIG. 22, the spatial densities are corrected depending upon the ratio of the large-sized vehicles to all of the vehicles and the inter vehicle gaps in the following manner.

      In addition, the correction coefficient Re thus calculated may be used for correcting the measurement result in part of the spatial measurement area E that does not lap on the traffic flow measurement area F. In the traffic flow measurement area F, since the length of each individual vehicle can be directly measured, the correction coefficients may be calculated for each individual vehicle.

      According to the second embodiment, not all of the picture elements contained in the image but the sample points corresponding to part of the picture elements contained in the image are processed, so that data produced during the calculation processes can be extremely decreased in quantity.
      <br/>
      Hence, the traffic congestion measuring apparatus can be simplified in hardware and reduced in cost.
      <br/>
      In addition, the traffic congestion measuring apparatus can process the image at high speed and, accordingly, measure the state of traffic congestion in real time.

    <p num="240">
      Because the presence and the movement of the vehicle is detected by processing brightness per sample line, the spatial velocity and the spatial density in each of the mesh sections can be detected.
      <br/>
      If the traffic congestion measuring apparatus is regulated so as to result in the fact that an area occupied by the vehicle which is moving at 40 km/h or lower is detected as a traffic congestion range, the traffic congestion measuring apparatus can directly measure, in real time, the velocities and the density of the vehicles lying in the measurement area, thereby making it possible to produce the detailed traffic information.

      The second embodiment has a great advantage in traffic control system for highways.

    <p num="241">
      It is possible that the traffic congestion measuring apparatus starts to measure the state of the traffic congestion without the previously leaning and with accuracy immediately after the setup of the apparatus is completed.

      In addition, the traffic congestion measuring apparatus can be stably operated to measure the state of the traffic congestion independently of the variations in circumstances such as locations, time, weather and traffic densities.

      The traffic congestion measuring apparatus can also measure the traffic queue length with ease.

      Each of the various parameters serving as criterion levels in the various judgments is varied in accordance with an actual route distance from the video camera to a location on the road corresponding to a position of each of the sample points, so that the results of the measurement is enhanced in accuracy.

      Since the various parameters are automatically determined in accordance with the actual route distance from the video camera to the location on the road corresponding to the position of each of the sample points, the traffic control system is managed with great facility.

    <p num="243">
      If a large number of video cameras and traffic congestion measuring apparatuses are arranged along the road at regular space intervals each corresponding to the length of the measurement area of each video camera, the state of traffic congestion can be measured over long distance.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, the state of traffic congestion in the whole measurement area is not estimated from measurement results in a local part of the measurement area but directly measured, thereby enabling the traffic control system to quickly detect various accidents such as traffic accidents or vehicular accidents.
