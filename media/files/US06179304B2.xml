      An apparatus for controlling pivoting the rear axle of a forklift.
      <br/>
      The forklift includes forks, which are lifted and lowered relative to a body frame.
      <br/>
      A locking mechanism, which includes a hydraulic damper and an electromagnetic valve, locks the rear axle to stabilize the body frame.
      <br/>
      A controller controls the locking mechanism to lock the rear axle when the fork height is at least as great as a predetermined height threshold value and the weight of a load on the fork is at least as great as a predetermined weight threshold value.
      <br/>
      The controller also controls the locking mechanism to lock the rear axle when the lateral acceleration is at least as great as a predetermined threshold value.
      <br/>
      Further, the controller changes the threshold value of the lateral acceleration in accordance with the fork height.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to an apparatus that controls pivoting of an axle in an industrial vehicle such as a forklift.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention pertains to an axle pivot control apparatus for locking an axle, which is pivotally supported by a vehicle's body frame
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      A typical industrial vehicle such as a forklift includes a rear axle that pivots relative to the body frame.
      <br/>
      The rear axle pivots such that all the wheels always contact the ground even if the vehicle runs over bumps and dips on the road surface.
      <br/>
      This structure improves comfort, handling and stability of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 58-211903 describes a forklift that has a locking mechanism for locking the rear axle against pivoting when lateral acceleration acting on the forklift exceeds a predetermined threshold value.
      <br/>
      Even if a great lateral force acts on the forklift, tilting of the forklift body frame is minimized.
      <br/>
      The forklift thus turns in a stable manner.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 58-167215 describes a forklift that has a locking mechanism that locks the rear axle against pivoting when the weight of a load on forks and the height of the forks exceed predetermined threshold values.
      <br/>
      When the load is heavy and the forks are high, the center of gravity of the forklift is raised, which destabilizes the forklift.
      <br/>
      However, the mechanism of the publication No. 58-167215 locks the rear wheels in such cases.
      <br/>
      The forklift therefore turns or loads and unloads in a stable manner.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The mechanism according to the publication No. 58-167215 determines whether to lock the rear axle in accordance with the weight of the load on the forks and the height of the forks regardless of the magnitude of the lateral acceleration acting on the body frame.
      <br/>
      However, even if the forks remain at a certain height, changes in the lateral acceleration change the side-to-side stability of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the mechanism of the publication No. 58-167215 requires that the threshold value regarding the fork height be relatively small so that the side-to-side stability of the vehicle is unaffected by a great lateral acceleration.
      <br/>
      When the fork height is greater than the threshold value, the rear axle is locked even if there is little or no lateral acceleration acting on the body frame, that is, even if the vehicle would be stable without locking the rear axle.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      If the functions of the mechanisms of the publications No. 58-211903 and No. 58-167215 are combined, a threshold value regarding the lateral acceleration is employed as well as the threshold values regarding the load weight and the fork height.
      <br/>
      The rear axle is locked when the lateral acceleration is greater than the threshold value and when the threshold values of the load weight and the fork height are exceeded.
      <br/>
      Such a combination allows the threshold value of the fork height to be maximized.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the rear axle is not unnecessarily locked.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      However, a greater threshold value regarding the fork height requires that the threshold value of the lateral acceleration be smaller such that the vehicle is stable when turning with the forks held relatively high.
      <br/>
      When the lateral acceleration is greater than the threshold value, the rear axle is locked even if the forks are relatively low, that is, even if the vehicle would be stable without locking the rear axle.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the threshold value of the fork height cannot be increased without considering the threshold value of the lateral acceleration.
      <br/>
      As a result, combining the functions of the two publications does not eliminate unwanted locking of the rear axle.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Unnecessary locking of the rear axle is contrary to the goal of improving the comfort, stability and handling of the vehicle by allowing the rear axle to pivot.
      <br/>
      For example, the center of gravity of the forklift is relatively close to the rear wheels when there is no load on the forks.
      <br/>
      In this state, if the rear axle is locked based on the lateral acceleration, running over bumps and dips on the road surface raises one of the front wheels.
      <br/>
      If the front wheels are driving wheels, decreased ground contact pressure causes the wheel to spin.
      <br/>
      The center of gravity is relatively close to the front wheels when the forklift carries a relatively heavy load.
      <br/>
      If the rear axle is locked in this state and one of the rear wheels runs over a bump, the other rear wheel loses contact with the road surface.
      <br/>
      Since the rear wheels are steered wheels, this reduces the steering effectiveness.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      If the rear axle is locked, the rear portion of the forklift is raised by a greater amount when one of the rear wheels runs over a bump compared to the case where the rear axle is not locked.
      <br/>
      Locking of the rear axle therefore may destabilize the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Further, locking the rear axle makes the body frame react to the road surface, which reduces the riding comfort of the forklift.
      <br/>
      It is therefore imperative to reduce unnecessary locking of the axle.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide an axle pivot control apparatus that reduces unnecessary locking of an axle.</p>
    <p num="11">
      To achieve the foregoing and other objectives and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, an axle pivot control apparatus for an industrial vehicle having an axle pivotally supported on a frame and a carrier for carrying a load is provided.
      <br/>
      The carrier is lifted and lowered relative to the frame.
      <br/>
      The apparatus includes a locking mechanism, a detector for detecting a value indicative of the traveling state of the industrial vehicle, a locking mechanism, a height detector, a weight detector, a first controller and a second controller.
      <br/>
      The locking mechanism restricts pivoting of the axle to stabilize the frame.
      <br/>
      The height detector detects a value indicative of the height of the carrier.
      <br/>
      The weight detector detects a value indicative of the weight of a load on the carrier.
      <br/>
      The first controller controls the locking mechanism based on whether the detected height value is at least as great as a predetermined height threshold value and the detected weight value is at least as great as a predetermined weight threshold value.
      <br/>
      The second controller independently controls the locking mechanism based on whether the value indicative of the traveling state of the industrial vehicle is at least as great as a predetermined travel threshold value.
      <br/>
      The apparatus also includes a changer for changing the travel threshold value in accordance with the detected height value.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The present invention also provides an axle pivot control method for an industrial vehicle having a pivotal axle and a carrier for carrying a load.
      <br/>
      The method includes the steps of reading a value indicative of the traveling state of the vehicle, reading a value indicative of the height of the carrier, reading a value indicative of the weight of a load on the carrier, judging whether the height of the carrier is at least as great as a predetermined height threshold value based on the carrier height value, judging whether the weight of the load is at least as great as a predetermined weight threshold value based on the load weight value, restricting pivoting of the axle based on whether the detected height value exceeds a predetermined height threshold value and while the height value exceeds a predetermined weight threshold value, independently restricting pivoting of the axle based on whether the traveling state value exceeds a predetermined travel threshold value, and changing the travel threshold value in accordance with the detected height value.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      A forklift 1 according to a first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 1-6. As shown in FIG. 3, the forklift 1 has driven front wheels 7 and steered rear wheels 11.
      <br/>
      A pair of outer masts 2 are arranged on the front of the forklift 1.
      <br/>
      A pair of inner masts 3 are arranged between the outer masts 2.
      <br/>
      A fork 4 is coupled to each inner mast 3 by a chain and a sprocket (neither is shown).
      <br/>
      The outer masts 2 are coupled to a body frame 1a by tilt cylinders 5, which tilt the masts relative to the body frame 1a.
      <br/>
      A lift cylinder 6 is located on each outer mast 2.
      <br/>
      The lift cylinders 6 vertically move the inner masts 3 thereby lifting and lowering the forks 4.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Each front wheel 7 is connected to an engine 9 by a differential ring gear 8 (see FIG. 1) and a transmission (not shown).
      <br/>
      Thus, the front wheels 7 are driven by the engine 9.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a rear axle 10 extends through the lower rear portion of the body frame 1a.
      <br/>
      The rear axle 10 is secured to the body frame 1a by a center pin 10a and pivots about the center pin 10a.
      <br/>
      The rear wheels 11, which are steered to turn the vehicle, are coupled to the ends of the rear axle 10.
      <br/>
      A steering cylinder (not shown) is located in the rear axle 10.
      <br/>
      The steering cylinder includes a pair of piston rods each coupled to one of the rear wheels 11.
      <br/>

      As shown in FIG. 2, a damper (hydraulic cylinder) 13 connects the rear axle 10 to the body frame 1a.

      The damper 13 includes a housing 13a and a piston 13b housed in the housing 13a.
      <br/>
      The housing 13a is coupled to the body frame 1a, and the piston 13b includes a piston rod 13c extending therefrom.
      <br/>
      The distal end of the piston rod 13c is coupled to the rear axle 10.
      <br/>
      The piston 13b defines a first chamber R1 and a second chamber R2 in the housing 13a.

    <p num="18">
      The damper 13 is connected to an electromagnetic valve 14 by first and second passages P1, P2.

      The first and second passages P1, P2 are connected with the first and second chambers R1, R2, respectively.
      <br/>
      The control valve 14 is a normally closed, two-way switch valve that has two ports.
      <br/>
      The valve 14 also includes a spool, a solenoid 14a for actuating the spool and a spring 14b.
      <br/>
      The spool has a connection position 16 for communicating the first passage P1 with the second passage P2 and a disconnection position 15 for disconnecting the first passage P1 from the second passage P2.
      <br/>
      The second passage P2 is coupled to an accumulator 17 by a third passage P3 and a check valve 18.
      <br/>
      The accumulator 17 stores hydraulic oil and compensates for hydraulic oil leakage from the damper 13.
      <br/>
      The second passage P2 includes a throttle 19.
      <br/>
      The damper 13 and the valve 14 lock the rear axle 10.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      When the solenoid 14a is de-excited, the disconnection position 15 of the spool is located between the passages P1, P2 as shown in FIG. 2 thereby disconnecting the passages P1, P2 from each other.
      <br/>
      The spool thus prohibits oil flow between the chambers R1, R2.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the damper 13 is locked.
      <br/>
      As a result, the rear axle 10 is locked to the body frame 1a.

      When the solenoid 14a is excited, the connection position 16 of the spool is located between the passages P1, P2 as shown in FIG. 2 thereby connecting the passages P1, P2 with each other.
      <br/>
      The spool thus permits oil flow between the chambers R1, R2.
      <br/>
      As a result, the piston 13b is movable in the housing 13a and the rear axle 10 is pivotable.

    <p num="20">
      Pivoting of the axle 10 is limited by a pair of stoppers 1b formed on the bottom of the frame 1a.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the stoppers 1b limit pivoting of the axle 10 within a range of  +- 4 (degree) . The control valve 14 is controlled by a controller 20, which is mounted on the front of the frame 1a as shown in FIG. 3.

      As shown in FIG. 1, the forklift 1 includes a yaw rate sensor 21, a vehicle speed sensor 22, a first fork height sensor 23, a second fork height sensor 24, a pressure sensor 25 and an axle angle sensor 26.
      <br/>
      The yaw rate sensor 21 includes, for example, a gyroscope and is located in the front portion of the body frame 1a together with the controller 20.

      The yaw rate sensor 21 detects the yaw rate Y (rad/sec) of the body frame 1a.
      <br/>
      The gyroscope of the sensor 21 may be a piezoelectric type, a gas-rate type or an optical type.
      <br/>
      The vehicle speed sensor 22 detects the rotational speed of the gear 8, which is proportional to the vehicle speed V of the forklift 1.

    <p num="22">
      The fork height sensors 23, 24 are located on one of the outer masts 2 at predetermined heights.

      The first height sensor 23 is turned off when the height of the forks 4 is smaller than two meters and is turned on when the fork height is two meters or greater.

      The height sensor 24 is turned off when the fork height is smaller than four meters and is turned on when the fork height is four meters or greater.

      Thus, the height sensors 23, 24 divide the fork height into three height ranges, or a low height range (zero to two meters), a middle height range (two to four meters) and a high height range (four meters and higher).

      Referring to signals from the height sensors, 23, 24, the controller 20 judges which range the forks 4 are in.

      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the axle angle sensor 26 is located on a side of the body frame 1a for detecting the pivot angle (axle angle)  THETA  of the rear axle 10.

      The sensor 26 includes, for example, a potentiometer and is coupled to the rear axle 10 by a link mechanism 27.
      <br/>
      The link mechanism 27 converts pivot motion of the axle 10 relative to the body frame 1a into rotational motion, and transmits the motion to the sensor 26.
      <br/>
      The axle angle  THETA  is the angle of the rear axle 10 relative to a horizontal plane that is fixed relative to the frame 1a.
      <br/>
      The horizontal plane includes the pivot axis of the axle 10.
      <br/>
      The axle angle  THETA  is zero degrees when the rear axle 10 is parallel to the horizontal plane of the frame 1a, and the range of the pivot angle is minus four degrees to plus four degrees (-4 (degree)  &lt;=  THETA  &lt;= 4 (degree) ).

      The CPU 34 computes the yaw rate Y, the vehicle speed V, the weight W and the axle angle  THETA  based on signals from the sensors 21, 22, 25, 26.

      The lateral acceleration Gs refers to a centrifugal acceleration laterally acting on the forklift 1 when the forklift 1 is turning.
      <br/>
      The rate of change  DELTA Y/ DELTA T of the yaw rate Y, or yaw acceleration, refers to changes, over time, of the yaw rate Y. The lateral acceleration Gs is computed by multiplying the vehicle speed V by the yaw rate Y (Gs=V * Y).
      <br/>
      When either of the values  DELTA Y/ DELTA T and Gs exceeds a corresponding threshold value Y0 and G0, the CPU 34 locks the rear axle 10.

      Independently of the lateral acceleration and the yaw acceleration judgements, the CPU 34 judges that a first locking condition is satisfied when the fork height is four meters or greater and the weight W on the forks 4 is equal to or greater than a threshold value W0.

      However, even if the first locking condition is satisfied, the rear axle 10 is not locked if the absolute value of the pivot angle  THETA  exceeds two degrees.

      In other words, a second locking condition is satisfied when the axle pivot angle  THETA  is within the lock region of FIG. 6.

      The rear axle 10 is therefore prevented from being locked when one of the rear wheels 11 runs over a step or a bump.

      <br/>
      Assuming the axle pivot angle is within the lock region, the rear axle 10 is locked when the fork height H is equal to or greater than the threshold value H0 (four meters) and the weight W on the forks 4 is equal to or greater than the threshold value W0.

      Independently, the axle 10 is locked if the lateral acceleration threshold is exceeded, regardless of the axle pivot angle  THETA .

      The lateral acceleration Gs has two threshold values (G0).
      <br/>
      When the fork height H is less than two meters, the threshold value G0 is set, for example, at 0.18N (Newtons).
      <br/>
      When the fork height is equal to or greater than two meters, the threshold value G0 is set, for example, at 0.08N. The threshold values G0, Y0 are determined based on road tests or are theoretically calculated such that the rear axle 10 is locked if the forklift 1 requires stabilization.

    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The CPU 34 then determines whether to lock the rear axle 10 referring to the map M1 of FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      As shown in the map M1, the rear axle 10 is locked when the fork height H is greater than the threshold value (four meters) and the weight W is greater than the threshold value W0 (assuming the axle pivot angle  THETA  is within the lock region).
      <br/>
      Independently, the axle is locked if the threshold value of the lateral acceleration or the yaw acceleration is exceeded (regardless of the axle pivot angle  THETA ).
      <br/>
      When the fork height H is low (zero to two meters), the threshold value G0 of the lateral acceleration is set at 0.18N. The value G0 is set at 0.08N when the fork height H is equal to or greater than two meters.
      <br/>
      The rear axle 10 is locked when the lateral acceleration Gs is greater than the threshold value (0.08N or 0.18N) or when the rate of change  DELTA Y/ DELTA T of the yaw rate Y is greater than the threshold value Y0.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The second height sensor 24 is used for determining whether the fork height H satisfies the locking condition, or whether the height H is equal to or greater than the threshold value H0 (four meters).
      <br/>
      The first height sensor 23 is used for determining which of the values (0.08N or 0.18N) should be used as the threshold value G0 of the lateral acceleration Gs.
      <br/>
      Since the threshold value G0 is varied between two values in accordance with the fork height H, unwanted locking of the rear axle 10 is prevented during turning of the forklift 1.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      If the acceleration Gs has only one threshold value G0, the smaller value (0.08N) must be used so that the vehicle is stable when turning with the forks 4 at or higher than two meters.
      <br/>
      Therefore, although the vehicle would remain stable until the lateral acceleration Gs reaches 0.18N, the rear axle 10 is locked if the lateral acceleration Gs reaches 0.08N when the forks 4 are lower than two meters.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment of FIGS. 1-6, however, the threshold value G0 is 0.18N when the fork height H is low (H&lt;2 m).
      <br/>
      The rear axle 10 is therefore not unnecessarily locked due to the lateral acceleration Gs.

    <p num="37">
      Changing the threshold value G0 of the lateral acceleration Gs in accordance with the fork height H allows the threshold value H0 of the fork height H to be maximized.

      When the fork height H is great, a small lateral acceleration Gs would destabilize the vehicle.
      <br/>
      However, when the fork height H is two meters or greater, the threshold value G0 is set at a smaller value.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the fork height H is great, the rear axle 10 is locked with a relatively small lateral acceleration Gs acting on the vehicle.
      <br/>
      This improves the stability of the vehicle thereby allowing the threshold value H0 of the fork height 4 to be maximized.

      The rear axle 10 is therefore not unnecessarily locked.

      <br/>
      As a result, the apparatus of FIGS. 1-6 improves fore-and-aft stability and comfort of the forklift 1.
      <br/>
      Further, the apparatus prevents the front wheels 7 from being raised thereby preventing the wheels of the forklift 1 from spinning.

    <p num="39">
      When the absolute value of the axle angle  THETA  is greater than two degrees, the rear axle 10 is not locked even if the fork height H is greater than the threshold value H0 and the weight W on the forks 4 is greater than the threshold value W0.
      <br/>
      That is, when the absolute value of the axle angle  THETA  is greater than two degrees, one of the rear wheels 11 is very likely to be running over a bump or a step.
      <br/>
      In this state, locking the rear axle 10 causes one of the wheels 7, 11 to lose contact with the road surface when the forklift 1 moves to a flat road surface.
      <br/>
      If the absolute value of the angle  THETA  is less than two degrees, locking of the rear axle 10 does not hinder the contact between the four wheels 7, 11 and the road surface.
      <br/>
      Further, even if the absolute value of the axle angle  THETA  is greater than two degrees, the rear axle 10 is locked when at least one of the lateral acceleration Gs and the rate of change  DELTA Y/ DELTA T of the yaw rate Y is greater than the corresponding threshold value G0 and Y0.

    <p num="40">
      When the rear axle 10 is locked based on the lateral acceleration Gs during turning of the forklift 1, the CPU 34 stores the height H of the forks 4 in the ROM 35.

      That is, the CPU 34 causes the ROM 35 to memorize which of the high, middle and low height ranges the forks 4 are in when the axle 10 is locked.
      <br/>
      If the fork height H is changed during the turn, the threshold value G0 of the lateral acceleration is determined based on the greater of the current fork height H and the fork height H at the time of locking the rear axle 10.
      <br/>
      For example, if the fork height H is changed from a position at or higher than two meters to a position lower than two meters during turning of the forklift 1, the threshold value is maintained at 0.08N and is not changed to 0.18N. Therefore, even if the forks 4 are lowered during turning of the forklift 1, the rear axle 10 is not unlocked due to lowering of the forks 4.
      <br/>
      The forklift 1 thus turns in a stable manner with the rear axle 10 locked.

    <p num="41">
      When the forklift 1 finishes turning, the lateral acceleration Gs becomes smaller than the current threshold value G0 and the rear axle 10 is unlocked.

      At this time, the threshold value G0 is determined again based on the current fork height 4.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      When the forklift 1 starts turning, the rate of change  DELTA Y/ DELTA T of the yaw rate Y first exceeds the threshold value Y0 and the rear axle 10 is locked, while still unpivoted, before the lateral acceleration Gs increases.

      If the forklift 1 changes direction, the steering wheel 12 is rotated and the lateral acceleration Gs becomes zero during the direction change.
      <br/>
      However, the value  DELTA Y/ DELTA T is maintained equal to or greater than the threshold value Y0 while the steering wheel 12 is being rotated.
