    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a coating liquid for forming a transparent conductive coating, a substrate with transparent conductive coating, a process for producing the same and a display device having a front panel composed of the substrate with transparent conductive coating.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention is concerned with a coating liquid for forming a transparent conductive coating which is excellent in, for example, antistatic, electromagnetic shielding and anti-reflection properties, a substrate having such an excellent transparent conductive coating, a process for producing the same and a display device having a front panel composed of the above substrate with transparent conductive coating.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">It is common practice to form a transparent coating film having antistatic and anti-reflection capabilities on a surface of any of transparent substrates such as display panels of, for example, a cathode ray tube, a fluorescent character display tube and a liquid crystal display for the purpose of effecting the reductions of static electricity and reflection at such a surface.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Recently, attention has been drawn to the influence on human health of electromagnetic waves emitted from, for example, a cathode ray tube.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is desired to not only take the conventional antistatic and anti-reflection measures but also shield the above electromagnetic waves and the electromagnetic field produced by the emission of electromagnetic waves.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      One method of shielding, for example, the above electromagnetic waves comprises forming a conductive coating film for shielding electromagnetic waves on a surface of a display panel of, for example, a cathode ray tube.
      <br/>
      However, although it is satisfactory for the conventional antistatic conductive coating films that the surface resistivity is at least about 107  OMEGA /.quadrature., the conductive coating film for electromagnetic shielding must have a surface resistivity as low as 102 to 104  OMEGA /.quadrature.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      When it is intended to form the above conductive coating film of low surface resistivity with the use of the conventional coating liquid containing a conductive oxide such as Sb doped tin oxide or Sn doped indium oxide, the thickness thereof must inevitably be larger than that of the conventional antistatic coating film.
      <br/>
      However, the anti-reflection effect can be exerted only when the thickness of the conductive coating film is in the range of about 10 to 200 nm.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the use of the conventional conductive oxide such as Sb doped tin oxide or Sn doped indium oxide involves such the problem that it is difficult to obtain a conductive coating film which has low surface resistivity and is excellent in electromagnetic shielding and anti-reflection properties.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another method of forming a conductive coating film of low surface resistivity comprises applying a coating liquid for forming a conductive coating film which contains fine particles of a metal such as Ag to thereby form a coating film containing the fine metal particles on a substrate surface.
      <br/>
      In this method, a dispersion of colloidal fine metal particles in a polar solvent is used as the coating liquid for formation of a coating film which contains fine metal particles.
      <br/>
      In this coating liquid, the surface of fine metal particles is treated with an organic stabilizer such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatin in order to improve the dispersibility of the colloidal fine metal particles.
      <br/>
      However, the conductive coating film formed from the above coating liquid for formation of a coating film which contains fine metal particles has a drawback in that fine metal particles contact each other through the organic stabilizer in the coating film to thereby tend to have large interparticulate resistance with the result that the surface resistivity of the coating film cannot be low.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is needed to conduct heating at temperatures as high as about 400 (degree)  C. after the formation of the coating film to thereby decompose and remove the organic stabilizer.
      <br/>
      However, the heating at high temperatures for decomposition and removal of the organic stabilizer encounters the problem that fusion and aggregation of fine metal particles occur to thereby deteriorate the transparency and haze of the conductive coating film.
      <br/>
      Further, with respect to, for example, a cathode ray tube, the problem is encountered that quality deterioration is caused by exposure to high temperatures.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Moreover, the conventional transparent conductive coating film containing fine particles of a metal such as Ag involves the problem that the metal is oxidized, particulate growth is caused by ionization and occasionally corrosion occurs with the result that the conductivity and light transmittance of the coating film are deteriorated to thereby lower the reliability of the display device.</p>
    <p num="9">An object of the present invention is to resolve the above problems of the prior art and to provide a coating liquid for forming a transparent conductive coating which has surface resistivity as low as about 102 to 104  OMEGA /.quadrature.. and is excellent not only in antistatic, anti-reflection and electromagnetic shielding properties but also in reliability, a substrate having such an excellent transparent conductive coating, a process for producing the same and a display device including the above substrate with transparent conductive coating.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="24">The present invention will now be described in detail.</p>
    <p num="25">Coating Liquid for Forming a Transparent Conductive Coating</p>
    <p num="26">The coating liquid for forming a transparent conductive coating according to the present invention will first be described below.</p>
    <p num="27">The coating liquid for forming a transparent conductive coating according to the present invention comprises fine particles of a composite metal having an average particle size of 1 to 200 nm and a polar solvent.</p>
    <p num="28">�Fine Particles of Composite Metal�</p>
    <p num="29">The terminology "fine particles of a composite metal" used herein means fine particles composed of at least two kinds of metals.</p>
    <p num="30">
      At least two kinds of metals constituting the composite metal particles may be in the form of any of an alloy in a state of solid solution, an eutectic not in a state of solid solution and a combination of an alloy and an eutectic.
      <br/>
      In these composite metal particles, the metal oxidation and ionization are inhibited, so that, for example, the particulate growth of composite metal particles is inhibited.
      <br/>
      Thus, the reliability of the composite metal particles is high in that, for example, their corrosion resistance is high and the deterioration of their conductivity and light transmittance is slight.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Examples of such composite metal particles include those composed of at least two kinds of metals selected from among metals such as Au, Ag, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Cu, Fe, Ni, Co, Sn, Ti, In, Al, Ta and Sb.
      <br/>
      Preferred combinations of at least two types of metals include, for example, Au-Cu, Ag-Pt, Ag-Pd, Au-Pd, Au-Rh, Pt-Pd, Pt-Rh, Fe-Ni, Ni-Pd, Fe-Co, Cu-Co, Ru-Ag, Au-Cu-Ag, Ag-Cu-Pt, Ag-Cu-Pd, Ag-Au-Pd, Au-Rh-Pd, Ag-Pt-Pd, Ag-Pt-Rh, Fe-Ni-Pd, Fe-Co-Pd and Cu-Co-Pd.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In the present invention, it is preferred that the composite metal particles be composed of an alloy of a plurality of metals.
      <br/>
      Also, it is preferred that the composite metal particles comprise fine metal particles or fine alloy particles covered by a metal having a standard hydrogen electrode potential higher than that of the metal or alloy metal.
    </p>
    <p num="33">These composite metal particles can be produced by the following conventional processes.</p>
    <p num="34">
      (i) One process comprises simultaneously or separately reducing a plurality of metal salts in a mixed solvent of an alcohol and water.
      <br/>
      In this process, a reducing agent may be added according to necessity.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable reducing agents include ferrous sulfate, trisodium citrate, tartaric acid, sodium borohydride and sodium hypophosphite.
      <br/>
      Heat treatment may be conducted in a pressure vessel at about 100 (degree)  C. or higher.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      (ii) The other process comprises providing a dispersion of fine metal particles or fine alloy particles and causing fine particles or ions of a metal having a standard hydrogen electrode potential higher than the fine metal particles or the fine alloy particles to be present in the dispersion to thereby precipitate the metal of higher standard hydrogen electrode potential on the fine metal particles and/or the fine alloy particles.
      <br/>
      Further, a metal of higher standard hydrogen electrode potential may be deposited on the thus obtained composite metal particles.
    </p>
    <p num="36">The difference of standard hydrogen electrode potential between individual metals composing the above composite metal particles (when using at least three metals, difference between the maximum standard hydrogen electrode potential and the minimum standard hydrogen electrode potential) is preferably at least 0.05 eV and still preferably at least 0.1 eV. The metal exhibiting the maximum standard hydrogen electrode potential is preferably present in the composite metal particles in a weight ratio (metal exhibiting the maximum standard hydrogen electrode potential/composite metal) ranging from 0.05 to 0.95. When this weight ratio is less than 0.05 or exceeds 0.95, it may occur that the oxidation and ionization inhibiting effect of the composite metal is too slight to contribute toward a reliability enhancement.</p>
    <p num="37">
      It is preferred that the above metal exhibiting the maximum standard hydrogen electrode potential be abundant in the surface layer of the composite metal particles.
      <br/>
      The presence in abundance of the metal exhibiting the maximum standard hydrogen electrode potential in the surface layer of the composite metal particles inhibits the oxidation and ionization of the composite metal particles to thereby enable suppressing the particulate growth attributed to, for example, ion migration.
      <br/>
      Further, these composite metal particles have high corrosion resistance, so that the deterioration of conductivity and light transmittance can be suppressed.
