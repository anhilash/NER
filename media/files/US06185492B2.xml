      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a vehicle steering control apparatus and, more particularly, to a vehicle steering control apparatus which assists a steering effort so that a moving line of the vehicle matches a target moving line.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventionally, as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 7-104856, an apparatus for generating a steering force, when an actual moving line of a vehicle deviates from a previously determined moving line (hereinafter referred to as a predetermined line), so that the vehicle is moved in a direction in which the actual moving line is shifted closer to the predetermined line.
      <br/>
      The above-mentioned conventional apparatus has a mechanism for detecting a range of a lane on which the vehicle is moving and a mechanism for detecting a range of area in which the vehicle is moving in the lane.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the above-mentioned apparatus has a mechanism for generating a steering torque so as to return the vehicle to a middle of the lane when the vehicle is shifted toward a side of the lane.
      <br/>
      Hereinafter, this steering torque is referred to as a returning steering torque.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      According to the above-mentioned apparatus, when the moving line of the vehicle deviates from the predetermined line, such a situation can be conveyed to a driver of the vehicle by generating a returning steering torque.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the driver of the vehicle provided with the above-mentioned conventional apparatus can easily return the vehicle to the predetermined line by being assisted by the returning steering torque.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to the above-mentioned conventional apparatus, the vehicle can be easily and safely maintained to move on the predetermined line
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Generally, a moving line which provides a comfortable feel to a driver differs from driver to driver.
      <br/>
      However, in the above-mentioned conventional apparatus, a fixed line is always set without consideration of such difference among individuals.
      <br/>
      In the above-mentioned conventional apparatus, the returning steering torque may act to resist a steering effort by the driver when a moving line desired by the driver does not match the predetermined line.
      <br/>
      In this respect, the above-mentioned conventional apparatus is not always optimum in assisting a steering effort by a driver.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Additionally, the above-mentioned conventional apparatus can alert the driver by automatically generating a returning steering torque when the vehicle is shifted to a side of the-lane on which the vehicle is moving due to some reasons.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to the above-mentioned conventional apparatus, the vehicle is prevented from deviating from the lane in which the vehicle should be maintained.
      <br/>
      However, there may be an obstacle such as a motorcycle on the lane.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the vehicle must move a side of the lane so as to avoid the obstacle.
      <br/>
      However, the above-mentioned conventional apparatus generates a returning steering torque so as to return the vehicle to the middle of the lane.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the driver of the vehicle is required to make a steering effort to resist the returning steering force when an attempt is made to move along a side of the lane so as to avoid an obstacle.
      <br/>
      Thus, the above-mentioned conventional apparatus may provide a difficulty in maintaining movement of a vehicle along a side of a lane when the vehicle must move the side of the lane so as to avoid an obstacle.
    </p>
    <p num="8">As mentioned above, the conventional apparatus has a problem in that a driver cannot control a vehicle to move a desired line within a lane in which the vehicle is moving since the conventional apparatus always generates a steering torque to maintain the vehicle on a fixed line or always generates a steering torque proportional to a distance between the fixed line and the vehicle.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">It is a general object of the present invention to provide a vehicle steering control apparatus in which the above-mentioned problems are eliminated.</p>
    <p num="10">A more specific object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle steering control apparatus which controls a steering torque to move the vehicle toward a line desired by a driver or appropriate for circumstances of the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="11">Another object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle steering control apparatus which controls a steering torque to provide a good steering characteristic vehicle when a driver attempts to move the vehicle on a side of a lane on which the vehicle is moving while preventing the vehicle from deviating from the lane.</p>
    <p num="12">In order to achieve the above-mentioned objects, there is provided according to one aspect of the present invention a vehicle steering control apparatus recognizing a lane on which a vehicle is moving and controlling a steering torque of the vehicle so that the vehicle moves along the lane, the vehicle steering control apparatus comprising:</p>
    <p num="13">
      reference line setting means for setting a plurality of reference lines which extend along the lane and are arranged parallel to each other in a direction of a width of the lane;
      <br/>
      target moving line selecting means for selecting a target moving line from among the plurality of reference lines in accordance with a state of movement of the vehicle; and
      <br/>
      returning steering torque generating means for generating a steering torque for shifting a moving line of the vehicle toward the target moving line.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      According to the present invention, the steering torque is controlled so that the moving line of the vehicle matches the target moving line.
      <br/>
      The target moving line is determined to be one of the plurality of reference lines set on the lane, which target moving line is optimum for a state of movement of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in the present invention, the steering torque is controlled so that the vehicle moves on the moving line most appropriate for the state of movement of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="15">In the above-mentioned invention, the target moving line selecting means may select one of the reference lines which approximates a steering operation line achieved by a steering effort performed by a driver of the vehicle as the target moving line.</p>
    <p num="16">Accordingly, the target line is determined to be one of the reference lines which approximates the steering operation line, that is, a line on which the driver attempts to move the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Additionally, the vehicle steering control apparatus according to the present invention may further comprise:
      <br/>
      deviation preventing area setting means for setting a deviation preventing area on a side of the lane; and

    </p>
    <p num="18">
      According to the above-mentioned invention, if the moving line of the vehicle is shifted to a side of the lane, the moving line may overlap the deviation preventing area.
      <br/>
      This generates a torque (hereinafter referred to as a deviation preventing torque) which moves the vehicle toward the middle of the lane.
      <br/>
      According to the deviation prevention torque, the vehicle is effectively prevented from deviating from the lane.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Additionally, the vehicle steering control apparatus according to the present invention may further comprise:
      <br/>
      circumstances recognizing means for recognizing circumstances of a moving path of the vehicle; and
      <br/>
      control gain changing means for changing a magnitude of the steering torque generated by the deviation preventing torque generating means in accordance with the circumstances of the moving path.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In this invention, the magnitude of the deviation preventing torque is changed in accordance with the circumstances of a moving path of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The circumstances of the moving path of the vehicle includes one which allows deviation of the vehicle from the lane and one which cannot allow deviation of the vehicle from the lane.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the deviation preventing torque is set to be larger as the necessity of prevention of deviation is increased.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, deviation of the vehicle can be positively prevented under a condition in which the necessity of prevention of deviation is high.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a flexibility of steering effort can be maintained under a condition in which the necessity of prevention of deviation is low.

      Additionally, the above-mentioned invention may further comprise:
      <br/>
      circumstances recognizing means for recognizing circumstances of a moving path of the vehicle,
      <br/>
      wherein the deviation preventing area setting means includes area width setting means for setting a width of the deviation preventing area in accordance with the circumstances of the moving path.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In this invention, the magnitude of the deviation preventing torque is changed in accordance with the circumstances of a moving path of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The circumstances of the moving path of the vehicle includes one which allows deviation of the vehicle from the lane and one which cannot allow deviation of the vehicle from the lane.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the width of the deviation preventing area is set to be larger as the necessity of prevention of deviation is increased.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, deviation of the vehicle can be positively prevented under a condition in which the necessity of prevention of deviation is high.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a flexibility of steering effort can be maintained under a condition in which the necessity of prevention of deviation is low.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Further, the above-mentioned invention may further comprise:
      <br/>
      steering operation line learning means for learning a steering operation line with respect to each circumstance of the moving path, the steering operation line being achieved by a steering effort performed by a driver of the vehicle,
      <br/>
      wherein the area width setting means includes learning result reflecting means for reflecting a result of learning of the steering operation line learning means in the width of the deviation preventing area.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      According to the above-mentioned invention, the steering operation line is learned for each circumstances of the moving path.
      <br/>
      According to this learning a moving line which the driver attempts to lead the vehicle can be detected for each circumstance of the moving path.
      <br/>
      In other words, an area to which the driver does not desire to move the vehicle can be detected for each circumstance of the moving path.
      <br/>
      The area to which the driver does not desire to move the vehicle corresponds to an area where the vehicle enters when the vehicle moves a moving line which is not intended by the driver.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in such an area, the vehicle should be moved toward the middle of the lane.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the result of the learning is reflected so that the area to which the driver does not attempt to lead the vehicle is set as the deviation preventing area.
      <br/>
      If the deviation preventing area is set as mentioned above, deviation of the vehicle toward the area which is not usually used by the driver can be effectively prevented while a flexible operation can be maintained in an area which is usually used by the driver.

      <br/>
      intention determining means for determining whether or not a driver of the vehicle intentionally moves the vehicle to the control area; and
      <br/>
      returning steering torque restricting means for restricting generation of the returning steering torque when it is determined that the driver intentionally moves the vehicle to the control area.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      According to this invention, the control area is provided in a side area of the lane area.
      <br/>
      When the vehicle enters the control area, the returning steering torque is generated for directing the vehicle toward the middle of the lane area.
      <br/>
      If the returning steering torque is generated when the vehicle is shifted to a side area of the lane area, the vehicle is prevented from deviating from the lane area unless the driver of the vehicle intends to move the vehicle outside of the lane area.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      There may be a case in which the driver intentionally moves the vehicle to a side area of the lane area so as to avoid an obstacle in the lane area.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, when the vehicle is intentionally moved to the control area, the generation of the returning steering torque is prohibited.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a good steering operation can be achieved when the vehicle moves to a side area of the lane area.
    </p>
    <p num="28">In the above-mentioned invention, the intention determining means may include continuous time measuring means for measuring a continuous time during which the vehicle moves in the control area, and the returning steering torque restricting means may include first prohibition means for prohibiting generation of the returning steering torque when the continuous time reaches a predetermined time.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Accordingly, if the driver does not intend to move the vehicle to the side area of the lane area, when the vehicle unintentionally enters the control area, the vehicle may exit the control area in a short time.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the continuous time during which the vehicle moves in the control area is longer than the predetermined threshold value, it can be determined that the driver intentionally moves the vehicle to the side area of the lane area.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to this invention, the intention of the driver can be accurately recognized.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Additionally, in the above-mentioned invention, the intention determining means may include prohibition condition determining means for determining whether or not the vehicle is moved to a prohibition area which is provided outside the control area, and the returning steering torque restricting means may include second prohibition means for prohibiting generation of the returning steering torque when the vehicle enters the prohibition area.</p>
    <p num="31">
      In this invention, if the driver does not intend to move the vehicle to the side area of the lane area, when the vehicle unintentionally enters the control area, the vehicle may exit the control area in a short time.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if the vehicle reaches the prohibition area which is provided outside the control area, it can be determined that the driver intentionally moves the vehicle to the side area of the lane area.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to the present invention, intention of the driver can be accurately recognized.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Additionally, there is provided according to another aspect of the present invention a vehicle steering control apparatus comprising:

      a lane area detecting mechanism detecting a lane area extending in front of a vehicle provided with the vehicle steering control apparatus; and
      <br/>
      returning steering torque generating means for generating a returning steering torque which directs the vehicle toward a middle of the lane area when the vehicle moves to a control area provided in a side area of the lane area,
      <br/>
      wherein the returning steering torque generating means generates the returning steering torque for a predetermined period after the vehicle enters the control area.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      According to the above-mentioned invention, if the vehicle enters the control area, the returning steering torque is generated for the continuous period.
      <br/>
      The driver feels the returning steering torque via the steering wheel, and recognizes that the vehicle has entered the control area.
      <br/>
      After the returning steering torque is canceled, a good steering operation can be performed.
      <br/>
      If the vehicle unintentionally enters the control area, the driver may make a steering effort to return the vehicle toward a middle of the lane area after the driver feels the returning steering torque.
      <br/>
      If the vehicle intentionally enters the control area, the driver makes a steering effort to move the vehicle in the side area of the lane area.

    <p num="34">Additionally, the vehicle steering control apparatus according to the present invention may further comprise deviation preventing means for generating a deviation preventing steering torque which directs the vehicle toward a middle of the lane area when the vehicle moves in a deviation preventing area provided outside the control area.</p>
    <p num="35">
      According to this invention, the deviation preventing area is provided outside the control area.
      <br/>
      If the vehicle enters the deviation preventing area beyond the control area, the deviation preventing torque is generated so as to move the vehicle toward a middle of the lane area.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the vehicle is effectively prevented from deviating from the lane area.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Additionally, there is provided according to another aspect of the present invention a vehicle steering control apparatus comprising:
      <br/>
      guide line recognizing means for recognizing a guide line provided on a road on which a vehicle provided with the vehicle steering control apparatus is moving;
      <br/>
      steering control means for controlling a steering operation of the vehicle by detecting a positional state of the vehicle with respect to the guide line recognized by the guide line recognizing means;
      <br/>
      alarm torque providing means for attracting the attention of a driver of the vehicle by providing a torque to a steering mechanism of the vehicle in accordance with a positional state of the vehicle with respect to the guide line;
      <br/>
      tracking torque providing means for setting a target position on the road in accordance with a result of recognition of the guide line, and providing a torque to the steering mechanism so that the vehicle traces the target position;

      moving condition detecting means for detecting a condition of movement of the vehicle; and
      <br/>
      target position correcting means for correcting the target position in accordance with the condition of movement detected by the moving condition detecting means.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      According to the above-mentioned invention, since the torque provided to the steering mechanism is varied in accordance with the positional state of the vehicle with respect to the guide line, the driver can recognize how far the vehicle is located from the guide line by the torque which is transmitted to the driver via the steering mechanism.
      <br/>
      Additionally, since the torque is provided to the steering mechanism so that the vehicle traces the target position, the driver can easily maintain the vehicle to trace the target position which results in the vehicle being prevented from deviating from the road.
      <br/>
      Further, since the target position is corrected in accordance with the moving condition of the vehicle, the target position can be changed to a desired position, resulting in a stable movement of the vehicle without a sense of incongruity.

    </p>
    <p num="48">A description will now be given, with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, of a basic operation of the steering control apparatus according to the present embodiment.</p>
    <p num="49">
      FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a vehicle 40 provided with the steering control apparatus according to the present embodiment and a road 42 extending in front of the vehicle 40.
      <br/>
      White lines 44 and 46 are drawn on the road 42 for indicating boundaries of lanes.
      <br/>
      The video camera 12 provided in the vehicle 40 takes an image of the white lines 44 and 46 in front of the vehicle 40.

      The ECU 10 recognizes the positions of the white lines 44 and 46 based on the data regarding the white lines 44 and 46 in front of the vehicle, the data being supplied by the image processing device 14.
      <br/>
      Then, the ECU recognizes an area between the white lines 44 and 46 as a lane 48 on which the vehicle 40 is moving.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the ECU 10 assumes a moving line of the vehicle 40 based on a state of the vehicle 40 such as a vehicle speed V or a yaw rate  GAMMA  and a steering angle  THETA .
      <br/>
      Hereinafter, this moving line is referred to as an "assumed moving line".
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The ECU 10 detects an area of the lane 48 where the assumed moving line exists a predetermined distance Lo ahead of the vehicle 40.
      <br/>
      Then, the ECU 10 renders the motor 36 to generate a motor torque TM for correcting the steering angle  THETA  so that the assumed moving line matches a target moving line.
      <br/>
      Hereinafter, this motor torque TM is referred to as a "returning steering torque".
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a virtual surface 50 of the road 42 and a virtual sphere 52 provided on the virtual surface 50.
      <br/>
      The road 42 actually has a flat surface over the entire width.
      <br/>
      The steering control apparatus according to the present embodiment generates the returning steering torque TM so that a behavior of the vehicle 40 is similar to a behavior of the virtual sphere 52 on the virtual surface 50 when the vehicle 40 moves on the road 42.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In FIG. 3, a control area 54 is set in the middle of the lane 48 and deviation preventing areas 56 and 58 are set on each side of the lane 48.
      <br/>
      A plurality of grooves 60 are set in the control area 54, each of the grooves extending along the lane 48 parallel to each other in a direction of the width of the lane 48.
      <br/>
      The grooves 60 can be represented by grooves provided on the flat control area 54 in the virtual surface 50.
      <br/>
      Additionally, in the virtual surface 50, the deviation preventing areas 56 and 58 can be represented by a configuration in which the surface is raised from an inner side of the lane 48 toward each side of the lane 48.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The virtual sphere 52 provided on the virtual surface 50 moves so as to acquire a stable position in the lane 48.
      <br/>
      The virtual sphere 52 on the virtual surface 50 is set to a stable state when the virtual sphere 52 is located in the control area 54 rather than located in one of the deviation preventing areas 56 and 58.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the virtual sphere in the control area 54 is set to a stable state when the virtual sphere 52 is engaged with one of the grooves 60.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the sphere 52 on the virtual surface 50 tends to move on the road 42 while maintaining an engagement with one of the grooves 60.
    </p>
    <p num="55">In the present embodiment, the ECU 10 sets the control area 54 and the deviation preventing areas 56 and 58 in the lane 48 detected by the video camera 12, and sets a predetermined number of grooves 60 in the control area 54.</p>
    <p num="56">
      The ECU 10 selects one of the grooves 60 as a target moving line, and generates the returning steering torque for matching the assumed moving line of the vehicle 40 with the selected target moving line.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the ECU 10 generates the returning steering torque TM corresponding to a difference between the assumed moving line and the target moving line when the assumed moving line of the vehicle 40 enters one of the deviation preventing areas 56 and 58.
      <br/>
      Hereinafter, this returning steering torque is referred to as a "deviation preventing torque TM".
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      According to the above-mentioned process, the vehicle 40 moves on the road 42 as if the vehicle 40 traces one of the grooves 60 (hereinafter referred to as a selected groove) which is selected as the target moving line.
      <br/>
      Additionally, when the moving line of the vehicle 40 is shifted toward one of the sides of the road 42, the deviation preventing torque TM is generated so that a deviation of the vehicle 40 from the lane 48 is prevented.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to the steering control apparatus of the present embodiment, the behavior of the vehicle 40 moving on the road 42 can be similar to that of the virtual sphere 52 moving on the virtual surface 50.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The moving line which provides a comfortable feel to a driver of the vehicle moving on the road 42 is not always the same.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there may occur a difference between the selected groove and a line (hereinafter referred to as a steering operation line) along which the driver attempts to move the vehicle 40.
      <br/>
      If there is such a difference between the steering operation line and the selected groove, the returning steering torque TM generated by the steering control apparatus is a force which resists the steering effort of the driver.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if the selected groove is fixed to the same groove among the grooves 60, an assist function for tracing a moving line desired by the driver cannot be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      In order to eliminate the above-mentioned problem, the steering control apparatus according to the present embodiment has a feature in that one of the grooves 60 which approximates the steering operation line is selected as a new selected groove when a difference occurs between the steering operation groove and the selected groove.
      <br/>
      A description will be given below, with reference to FIG. 4, of the above mentioned feature.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example of a control routine performed by the ECU 10 so as to achieve the above-mentioned function.
      <br/>
      The routine shown in FIG. 4 is repeatedly started when the process of the routine is completed.
      <br/>
      When the routine shown in FIG. 4 is started, the process of step S100 is performed first.
    </p>
    <p num="61">In step S100, one of the grooves 60, which was stored as the selected groove by the ECU 10 by a previous process or a factory delivery setting, is read.</p>
    <p num="62">
      In step S102, a deviation angle  DELTA  THETA  is calculated.
      <br/>
      The deviation angle  DELTA  THETA  is a steering angle required for matching the moving line of the vehicle 40, that is, the line (steering operation line) along which the driver attempts to move the vehicle 40, with the selected groove.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      In step S104, it is determined whether or not the absolute value .vertline.
      <br/>
      DELTA  THETA .vertline. of the deviation angle  DELTA  THETA  is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold value TH THETA .
      <br/>
      The threshold value TH THETA  is a value for determining whether the driver intends to achieve the steering operation line which does not match the selected groove.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if it is determined, in step S104, that .vertline.
      <br/>
      DELTA  THETA .vertline. &gt;= TH THETA  is not established, it can be determined that the driver does not intend to achieve the steering operation line which does not match the selected groove.

      In this case, the process of step S106 is performed next.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      In step S106, it is determined whether or not the deviation angle  DELTA  THETA  is equal to "0".
      <br/>
      If  DELTA  THETA =0 is established, it can be determined that the moving line of the vehicle 40 matches the selected groove, that is, the target moving line.
      <br/>
      In this case, the present routine is ended without performing any process thereafter.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if it is determined that  DELTA  THETA =0 is not established, the process of step S108 is performed next.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      In step S108, a returning steering torque TM is output for rendering the deviation angle  DELTA  THETA  to be equal to "0", that is, for matching the moving line of the vehicle 40 with the target moving line.
      <br/>
      After the process of step S108 is completed, a condition which is preferable to perform a steering effort to match the moving line of the vehicle 40 with the target moving line is established.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to the above-mentioned process, the vehicle 40 can be easily and safely moved along the target moving line.
      <br/>
      After the process of step S108 is completed, the present routine is ended.

      If it is determined, in step S104 of the present routine, that .vertline.
      <br/>
      DELTA  THETA .vertline. &gt;= TH THETA  is established, it can be determined that the driver leads the vehicle to trace a line different from the target moving line.
      <br/>
      In this case, the process of step S110 is performed subsequent to step S104.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      In step S110, it is determined whether or not the condition of step S104 continues for a predetermined time period t0.
      <br/>
      As a result, if it is determined that the condition of step S104 continues for a predetermined time period t0, it can be determined that the driver intentionally leads the vehicle 40 on a line different form the selected groove, that is, the driver attempts to achieve a steering operation line different from the selected groove.
      <br/>
      In this case, the process of step S102 is performed next so as to change the selected groove to one which matches the steering operation line.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if it is determined that .vertline.
      <br/>
      DELTA  THETA .vertline. &gt;= TH THETA  does not continue for the predetermined time period t0, the driver's intention cannot be determined.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if such a determination is made in step S110, the process of step S106 is performed next.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      In step S112, the output of the returning steering torque TM is stopped.

      After the process of step S112 is performed, the driver can easily achieve a steering operation line which does not match the selected groove.
    </p>
    <p num="69">In step S114, one of the grooves 60 which approximates the moving line of the vehicle 40 is detected.</p>
    <p num="70">
      In step S116, it is determined whether or not one of the grooves 60 detected in step S114 is fixed to a specific one of the grooves 60.

      If it is determined that the predetermined time to has not passed after the vehicle 40 entered the one of the control areas 62 and 64, the process of step S254 is performed again.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if it is determined that the predetermined time t0 has passed after the vehicle 40 entered the one of the control areas 62 and 64, the present routine is ended immediately.
      <br/>
      According to the present routine, when the vehicle 40 entered one of the control areas 62 and 64, the generation of the returning steering torque TM is continued until the predetermined time to has passed and the generation of the returning steering torque TM is stopped immediately after the predetermined time t0 has passed.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      Normally, the driver of the vehicle 40 positively returns the vehicle 40 to the middle of the lane 48 after the returning steering torque TM is transmitted to the steering wheel 26 except for a case in which the driver intentionally moves the vehicle 40 to the side area of the lane 48.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if it is determined, in step S262, that a duration of the vehicle 40 being maintained in one of the control areas 62 and 64 reaches the predetermined time t0, it can be determined that the driver is intentionally moving the vehicle 40 to the side area of the lane 48.

    <p num="130">
      Thus, according to the steering control apparatus of the present embodiment, when the vehicle 40 enters one of the control areas 62 and 64 against the driver's will, deviation of the vehicle 40 from the lane 48 can be positively prevented by generating the returning steering torque TM.
      <br/>
      Additionally, when the driver intentionally moves the vehicle 40 to the side area of the lane, a good steering characteristic can be achieved by canceling the returning steering torque TM.

      The steering control apparatus according to the seventh embodiment of the present embodiment is achieved by having the ECU perform a control routine shown in FIG. 13 in the system structure shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>

      FIG. 12 shows a virtual cross section of the road 42 (hereinafter referred to as a virtual cross section (VI)).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 12, parts that are the same as the parts shown in FIG. 9 are given the same reference numerals, and descriptions thereof will omitted.
      <br/>
      The steering control apparatus according to the seventh embodiment has a feature in that the vehicle 40 performs a steering characteristic the same as that performed when the vehicle 40 moves on a road having the virtual cross section (VI).
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      In the present embodiment, the road 42 has a first lane 66 and a second lane 68.
      <br/>
      The first lane 66 is defined by the white lines 44 and 46.
      <br/>
      The first lane is separated from the second lane by the white line 44.
      <br/>
      The first lane 66 is provided with a left-side control area 72 on a side area on the white line 44 side, and is provided with a right-side control area 74 on the white line 46 side.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a prohibition area 76 is provided between the white line 44 and the left-side control area 72, and a prohibition area 78 is provided between the white line 46 and the right-side control area 74.
      <br/>
      The second lane 68 is also provided with left-side and right-side control areas and prohibition areas similar to the first lane.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      The virtual cross section (VI) is configured so that a middle portion and the prohibition areas 76 and 78 area flat and the control areas 72 and 74 are raised as they approach the respective white lines 44 and 46.
      <br/>
      A cross-section of the second lane 68 has the same configuration as the cross-section of the first lane 66.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      A returning steering torque which directs the vehicle 40 toward the middle of the first lane 66 is input to wheels of the vehicle 40 moving on a road having the virtual cross section (VI) when the vehicle 40 enters one of the left-side control area 72 and the right-side control area 74.
      <br/>
      The thus-generated returning steering torque is canceled when the vehicle 40 enters the prohibition area 76 from the left-side control area 72 or when the vehicle 40 enters the prohibiting area 76 from the right-side control area 74.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, after the driver of the vehicle 40 moves the vehicle 40 to one of the prohibition areas 76 and 78 by resisting the returning steering torque, a normal steering operation is performed in the vehicle 40.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      The vehicle 40 moving on the road having the virtual cross section (VI) can be more easily deviated outwardly from the left-side control area 72 or the right-side control area 74 as a width of the control area 72 or 74 is decreased.
      <br/>
      The width of each of the control areas 72 and 74 is set to be smaller than the width of each of the control areas 62 and 64 of the sixth embodiment.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the vehicle 40 moving on the road having the virtual cross section (VI) can easily exit the control area 72 or 74 outwardly.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      In the virtual cross section (III) shown in FIG. 9, the left-side and right-side control areas 62 and 64 are provided adjacent to the respective white lines 44 and 46.
      <br/>
      If such a construction is adopted to a road having a plurality of lanes, a control area of one lane is adjacent to a control area of the adjacent lane.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      If control areas of the different lanes are adjacent to each other, a vehicle exiting from one control area immediately enters another control area of the adjacent lane.
      <br/>
      A direction of the returning torque generated in one control area is opposite to a direction of the returning steering torque generated in another control area adjacent to the one control area.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when a vehicle moves from one control area to another control area as mentioned above, a large change is generated in the returning steering torque.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      However, the virtual cross section (VI) is provided with the prohibition areas 76 and 78 on the outer side of each of the control areas 72 and 74.
      <br/>
      In the prohibition areas 76 and 78, a returning steering torque is not generated and transmitted to the wheels to be steered.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in the vehicle moving on the road having the virtual cross section (VI), there is no large change in the returning steering torque when the vehicle exits one control area.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      FIG. 13 is a flowchart of an example of a control routine performed by the ECU 10 so as to achieve a steering characteristic the same as that of a vehicle moving on the road having the virtual cross section (VI).

      The routine shown in FIG. 13 is repeatedly started every time the process of the routine is completed.
      <br/>
      When the routine shown in FIG. 13 is started, the process of step S280 is performed.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      In step S280, it is determined whether or not the vehicle 40 has entered one of the left-side and right-side control areas 72 and 74 during a period from the immediately preceding cycle to the present cycle.

      In step S280, it is determined that the above-mentioned condition is established when the vehicle 40 has entered one of the control areas 72 and 74 from the inner side of each of the lanes 66 and 68.

      In step S282, it is determined whether or not a control prohibition flag is turned on.
      <br/>
      The control prohibition flag is turned on when the vehicle 40 enters one of the prohibition areas 76 and 78.
      <br/>
      If it is determined, in step S282, that the control prohibition flag is turned on, steps S284 to S292 are skipped and the process of step S294 is performed.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      In step S284, a control angle  THETA  including a plus or minus sign is calculated.
      <br/>
      The control angle  THETA  is an angle which should be provided to the steering shaft 28 so that the assumed moving line of the vehicle 40 matches the center of the lane 48.
    </p>
    <p num="146">In step S286, a drive current I is calculated which is to be supplied to the motor 36 in response to a magnitude of the control angle  THETA .</p>

      In step S288, the process for driving the motor 36 by the drive current I is performed.
      <br/>
      When the process of step S288 is performed, the motor 36 generates the returning steering torque TM when the control prohibition flag is turned off after the vehicle 40 has entered one of the control areas 72 and 74.

    <p num="148">
      In step S290, it is determined whether or not the vehicle 40 has entered one of the prohibition areas 76 and 78 during a period from the immediately preceding cycle to the present cycle.

    <p num="149">
      In step S292, the control prohibition flag is turned on.

      If the process of step S292 Is performed, it is determined, in step S282 of the subsequent cycle that the prohibition flag is turned on.
      <br/>
      According to the above-mentioned process, the generation of the returning steering torque TM can be prohibited after the vehicle 40 enters one of the prohibition areas 76 and 78.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      In step 294, it is determined whether or not the vehicle 40 has exited one of the prohibition areas 76 and 78.
      <br/>
      As a result, if it is determined that the vehicle 40 has exited one of the prohibition areas 76 and 78, the process of step S296 is performed.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      Thus, according to the above-mentioned process, a condition, in which the returning steering torque TM can be generated after the vehicle 40 exits one of the prohibition areas 76 and 78, can be rapidly established.

    <p num="152">
      In step S298, it is determined whether or not the vehicle 40 has exited one of the control areas 72 and 74.

      <br/>
      If it is determined that the vehicle 40 has not exited the control areas 72 or 74, the process of step S282 and subsequent steps are performed again.

    <p num="153">As mentioned above, according to the steering control apparatus of the present invention, the following functions can be achieved:</p>
    <p num="154">
      1) generating an appropriate returning steering torque TM when the vehicle 40 is shifted from a middle of the lane to a side area of the lane;

      The torque provided to the steering means M3 is transmitted to the driver of the vehicle, and thereby the driver can recognize a positional state of the vehicle with respect to the guide line.
    </p>
    <p num="237">
      Additionally, the attention of a driver strongly attracted when the vehicle is deviated outwardly in a curve by varying the torque in accordance with the radius R of the curve.
      <br/>
      That is, the torque is increased in an area adjacent to the guide line on an outer side of the curve.
    </p>
    <p num="238">
      FIG. 30 is a flowchart of another steering control operation, as the steering control means M2, performed by the ECU 230.
      <br/>
      This steering control operation is repeatedly performed at a predetermined interval.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 30, the ECU 230 reads, in step S442, the offset amount E(n), the present transverse offset amount e and the radius R output from the guide line recognizing device 236.
      <br/>
      Then, in step S444, it is determined whether or not the guide line of the road can be recognized by the guide line recognizing device 236.
      <br/>
      If the guide line can be recognized, the offset amount E(n) is within a predetermined range.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the guide line cannot be recognized, the offset amount E(n) is set to a specific value outside the predetermined range.
    </p>
    <p num="239">
      If the guide line can be recognized, the routine proceeds to step S446.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the guide line cannot be recognized, the routine is ended.
      <br/>
      In steps S446 and S448, the present transverse offset amount e obtained from the guide line recognizing device 236 is compared with the predetermined values L1 and L2.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 31, the predetermined value L1 is a value for determining whether or not the vehicle is located adjacent to the middle of the road.
      <br/>
      The predetermined value L1 is, for example, about a few tens of centimeters.
      <br/>
      The predetermined value L2 is a value for determining whether or not the vehicle is located adjacent to a guide line of the road.
      <br/>
      The predetermined value L2 is, for example, about one meter and a few tens of centimeters.
    </p>
    <p num="240">
      If it is determined, in step S446, that .vertline.e.vertline. &lt;= L1, the routine proceeds to step S450 to set kpa to the position control gain kp and set kta to the torque control gain kt.
      <br/>
      If it is determined, in step S446 and step S448, that L1 &lt;= .vertline.e.vertline. &gt;= L1+L2, the routine proceeds to step S452 so as to set kpb to the position control gain kp and set ktb to the torque control gain kt.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if it is determined that L1+L2&lt;.vertline.e.vertline., the routine proceeds to step S454 so as to set kpc to the position control gain kp and set kt1 to the torque control gain kpc.
    </p>
    <p num="241">The above-mentioned values for position control gain kp and the torque control gain kt have the following relationships.</p>

    <p num="243">
      As mentioned above, the control gains are set so that attention of the driver is attracted more strongly as the vehicle move closer to the guide line.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the process of step S450 corresponds to a tracking torque providing means, and the process of step S454 corresponds to an alarming torque providing means.
    </p>
    <p num="244">
      After the process of one of steps S450, S452 and S454 are performed, the routine proceeds to step S456 so as to calculate the steering control amount  THETA c and the steering torque T by the following equations (8) and (9).
      <br/>
      THETA c=(kp * e)+(kd * de)  (8)
      <br/>
      T=kt * C  (9)
    </p>
    <p num="245">In the above, C is a predetermined value.</p>
    <p num="246">
      Thereafter the routine proceeds to step S458.
      <br/>
      In step S458, the drive circuit 240 is activated based on the steering control amount  THETA c and the steering torque T. Thereby, the electric motor 221 is driven so as to operate the front wheels FW1 and FW2, and the routine is ended.
    </p>
    <p num="247">
      As mentioned above, when the vehicle is moving in the middle of the road or lane, a steering control (lane tracking) is performed so that the vehicle does not deviate from the middle of the road or lane.
      <br/>
      Thus, a stable movement of the vehicle is achieved.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the steering operation of the vehicle is not performed by an automatic steering control but a manual control, and thereby the steering control operation by the steering control apparatus according to the present embodiment can be overcome by a steering effort performed by the driver.
    </p>
    <p num="248">
      It should be noted that the torque control gain kt can be varied in accordance with a steering angle and a steering angle velocity (or a yaw rate).
      <br/>
      That is, the value ktc for the torque control gain kt is increased when the steering angle and the steering angle velocity (differential value of the steering angle with respect to time) are smaller than the respective threshold values.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the value ktc for the torque control gain kt is decreased when the steering angle and the steering angle velocity are greater than the respective threshold values.
    </p>
    <p num="249">
      FIG. 32 is a flowchart for achieving the above-mentioned process.
      <br/>
      This process is interruptedly started at every predetermined time.
      <br/>
      In step S460, the steering angle  THETA  and the steering angle velocity  DELTA  THETA  are read.
      <br/>
      Then, in step S462, it is determined whether or not the steering angle is greater than a threshold value  ALPHA  or whether or not the steering angle velocity  DELTA  THETA  is greater than a threshold value  BETA .
      <br/>
      If  THETA &gt; ALPHA  or  DELTA  THETA &gt; BETA , the routine proceeds to step S464 so as to decrease the value ktc for the torque control gain kt.
      <br/>
      If  THETA  &lt;=  ALPHA  and  DELTA  THETA  &lt;=  BETA , the routine proceeds to step S466 so as to increase the value ktc for the torque control gain kt.
      <br/>
      Thereby, when the steering angle and the steering angle velocity of the vehicle 270 are large, a lane change can be easily performed so that the vehicle 270 can move to an adjacent lane as indicated by a dotted arrow and 270A in FIG. 33. On the other hand, if the steering angle and the steering angle velocity are small, the vehicle 270 can be maintained within the lane as indicated by 270B in FIG. 33.
    </p>
    <p num="250">
      Alternatively, the position control gain kp and the torque control gain may be varied in accordance with a position of the vehicle (the present transverse offset amount).
      <br/>
      That is, if the left turn steering operation is detected when the vehicle is moving on the left side of a road or lane, both the value kpc of the position control gain kp and the value ktc of the torque control gain kt are increased.
      <br/>
      Similarly, if the left turn steering operation is detected when the vehicle is moving on the right side of a road or lane, both the value kpc of the position control gain kp and the value ktc of the torque control gain kt are increased.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that a left turn steering can be recognized when a value obtained by subtracting the present steering angle from the immediately preceding steering angle is positive.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a right turn steering can be recognized when a value obtained by subtracting the present steering angle from the immediately preceding steering angle is negative.
    </p>
    <p num="251">
      FIG. 34 is a flowchart for achieving the above-mentioned process.
      <br/>
      This process is interruptedly started every predetermined time.
      <br/>
      In step 470, the present transverse offset amount e, the immediately preceding steering angle  THETA (k-1) and the present steering angle  THETA (k) are read.
      <br/>
      In step S472, it is determined whether a left turn steering or a right turn steering is being performed by determining whether a difference  THETA (k-1)- THETA (k) is positive or negative.
      <br/>
      If the difference is positive, the routine proceeds to step S474 in which the left turn steering is recognized.
      <br/>
      If the difference is negative, the routine proceeds to step S476 in which the right turn steering is recognized.
    </p>
    <p num="252">
      Thereafter, in step S478, whether or not the vehicle is moving on the left side of the road is obtained.
      <br/>
      If it is determined that the vehicle is moving on the left side, the routine proceeds to step S480.
      <br/>
      In step S480, it is determined whether or not the left turn steering is being performed.
      <br/>
      If it is determined that the left turn steering is being performed, the routine proceeds to step S482 so as to increase the value kpc for the position control gain kp and the value ktc of the torque control gain kt.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if it is determined that the left turn steering is not being performed, that is, if the right turn steering is being performed, the routine proceeds to step S484 so as to set the normal value kpc to the position control gain kp and the normal value kpt to the torque control gain kp.
    </p>
    <p num="253">
      On the other hand, if it is determined, in step S478, that the vehicle is not moving on the left side, that is, if the vehicle is moving on the right side, the routine proceeds to step S486.
      <br/>
      In step S486, it is determined whether or not the left turn steering is being performed.
      <br/>
      If it is determined that the left turn steering is not being performed, that is, if the right turn steering is being performed, the routine proceeds to step S482 so as to increase the value kpc for the position control gain kp and the value ktc of the torque control gain kt.

      <br/>
      According to the above-mentioned process, vehicles 271 and 272 shown in FIG. 35 can be provided with a good capability to maintain moving within the current lane.
    </p>
    <p num="254">Additionally, if the vehicle is moving within a range L1+L2, and when an absolute value of the steering angle  THETA  is smaller than a predetermined value  THETA 0 for a predetermined period t0 (for example, a few tens of seconds), the predetermined value L1 may be shifted leftwardly or rightwardly by an average value of the present transverse offset values e so as to change a moving line of the vehicle from the middle of the lane to a presently moving position as shown in FIG. 36.</p>
    <p num="255">
      FIG. 37 is a flowchart for achieving the above-mentioned process.
      <br/>
      This process is interruptedly started at every predetermined time.
      <br/>
      In step S490, the present transverse offset amount e and the steering angle  THETA  are read.
      <br/>
      Then, in step S492, it is determined whether or not an absolute value of the present transverse offset amount e is smaller that the predetermined value L1+L2.
      <br/>
      Additionally, it is determined, in step S494, whether or not an absolute value of the steering angle  THETA  is smaller than the predetermined value  THETA 0.

      If the condition of one of steps S492 and S494 is not satisfied, the routine proceeds to step S496 so as to set a timer t to "0".
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the conditions of both steps S492 and S494 are satisfied, the routine proceeds to step S498 so as to count up the timer t. Then, in step S500, it is determined whether or not the timer t exceeds the predetermined value t0.
      <br/>
      If the timer t exceeds the predetermined value t0, the routine proceeds to step S502 so as to shift the predetermined value L1 leftwardly or rightwardly by the average value of the present transverse offset values e, and the routine is ended.
