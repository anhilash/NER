    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to force adjusting devices, and more particularly relates to a force adjusting device that is easily adjustable to vary a biasing force, but that locks after adjustment to maintain an adjusted biasing force.
      <br/>
      Further, the present invention concerns a chair that incorporates the force adjusting device into an adjustable lumbar support arrangement on a back of the chair.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Force adjusting devices are sometimes used in mechanical assemblies to provide a biasing force to accomplish a desired result.
      <br/>
      A problem is that where significant biasing force is desired, these mechanisms can become expensive, unacceptably large in size, and unacceptably complex.
      <br/>
      Complexity can further result in quality and warranty problems.
      <br/>
      Another problem is that there often are conflicting requirements for such devices.
      <br/>
      For example, it is desirable to provide an adjusting motion that is easily accomplished, but that provides significant change in biasing force with only a small amount of adjustment effort and motion.
      <br/>
      Further, when used in retail consumer products, the adjusting motion must preferably operate smoothly and provide a luxurious feel to the user, while using low cost and easily assembled components.
      <br/>
      It is difficult to simultaneously achieve such a result.
      <br/>
      Still further, the adjusting motion must be intuitively obvious so that users will know how to adjust the device without having to read an instruction manual, yet the adjusting device must have an aesthetically acceptable appearance and only take up a minimum of space.
      <br/>
      Also, assembly of the force adjusting device to the component being biased preferably must be easily accomplished with low labor requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="3">Accordingly, a force adjusting device is desired that is reliable, relatively non-complex, solves the aforementioned problems, and has the aforementioned advantages.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="11">
      A force adjusting device 50 (FIG. 1) embodying the present invention is shown in a lumbar biasing device on a chair 20.
      <br/>
      The chair 20 includes a base 21 and a reclineable back 22 pivoted to the base 21.
      <br/>
      The back 22 includes a back frame 30 pivoted at pivot 25, and a flexible back shell 31 pivoted to the back frame 30 at top pivots 32 and at a bottom pivot 33.
      <br/>
      The back shell 31 has relatively stiff thoracic and pelvic sections 27 and 28, but a relatively flexible lumbar section 29 connecting the thoracic and pelvic sections 27 and 28.
      <br/>
      Despite the flexibility of lumbar section 29, the back shell 31 comprises a sheet that is relatively stiff along a surface or "plane" of the back shell 31.
      <br/>
      The lumbar section 29 protrudes forwardly to define a forwardly concave shape in its at-rest position in the chair 20.
      <br/>
      A belt bracket 34 is attached along a bottom of the back shell 31.
      <br/>
      The belt bracket 34 has forwardly extending flanges 35 that include the bottom pivot 33.
      <br/>
      The combination of the belt bracket 34 with flanges 35, the flexible lumbar section 29, and the stiff thoracic and pelvic sections 27 and 28 cause the back shell 31 to flex along a predetermined path as the pelvic section 28 rotates about bottom pivot 33.
      <br/>
      The force adjusting device 50 is mounted at pivot 33 to back frame 30 and is configured to rotationally bias the flange 35 of belt bracket 34, so that the lumbar section 29 is biased forwardly to posturally and comfortably support a seated user's lower back.
      <br/>
      The force adjusting device 50 provides an adjustable biasing force on the back shell 31 that provides optimal, yet adjustable, lumbar support to a seated user.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The above description of chair 20 is believed to be sufficient for an understanding of the present combination that includes the novel force adjusting device 50.
      <br/>
      Nonetheless, a more detailed description of the chair 20, and in particular of the back shell 31 and its flexible lumbar region, can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,871,258, issued Feb. 16, 1999, entitled Chair with Novel Seat Construction, and also in U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/957,473, filed Oct. 24, 1997, entitled Chair Including Novel Back Construction, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that a scope of the present invention includes using the force adjusting device 50 in combination with an adjustable force lumbar support arrangement as shown in the illustrated chair, but it is also to be understood that the present invention includes other uses of the force adjusting device 50.
      <br/>
      For example, the force adjusting device can be used in other applications on a chair requiring force adjustment, or in other non-chair type furniture, such as desks, cabinets, and tables requiring an adjustable biasing device, or even in non-furniture situations, where a first component must be adjustably biased relative to a second component with an easily adjustable but a secure and well-packaged force adjusting device.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The lumbar force adjusting device 50 (FIG. 3) includes a housing 52 that attaches to a rigid component, e.g., the back frame 30 on the chair 20, and is configured to bias a movable component, e.g., the flange 35 of the belt bracket 34 on the chair 20, about the pivot 33.
      <br/>
      The housing 52 snappingly attaches to the base 51 and retains a torsional spiral spring 53, a spring hub 54, a sun gear 55, and planet gears 56 therebetween.
      <br/>
      The planet gears 56 engage a ring gear 56' (FIG. 4) inside a concavity of the housing 52.
      <br/>
      The spring 53, sometimes referred to as a "biasing member" herein, includes an inner end 57 that engages a slotted protrusion on the spring hub 54, and an outer end 58 that engages a protrusion 59 (FIG. 3) on the belt bracket flange 35.
      <br/>
      The protrusion 59 extends through an arcuate slot 59' in the back frame 30.
      <br/>
      The sun gear 55 extends through the housing 52 and engages a center of a sprague clutch 60.
      <br/>
      A drive ring 61 secured to knob 66 has protrusions that engage L-shaped legs 62 of the sprague clutch 60 at locations spaced from its center axis.
      <br/>
      The "elbow" 63 that joins inner and outer sections 64 and 65 of the L-shaped legs 62 operably engages detents in a recess on the top of the housing 52.
      <br/>
      The knob 66 and housing 52 aesthetically cover the arrangement and, in combination with housing 52, provide a compact package.
      <br/>
      The knob 66 and the drive ring 61 make up an adjuster that is operably connected to the gear arrangement 55/56/56' and to the clutch 60.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      More specifically, the base 51 (FIG. 4) includes a panel body 75 with hook-shaped tabs 76 configured to fit into mating apertures 77 (FIG. 3) in the lower section 78 of the back frame 30.
      <br/>
      The hook-shaped tabs 76 are shaped to attach upon rotation of the base 51 to temporarily attach the force adjusting device 50 to the back frame 30.
      <br/>
      A hex-shaped projection 76' (FIG. 4) on base 51 extends into hole 77' (FIG. 3) in the lower section 78 and is configured to be turned by a socket wrench to assist with the assembly or disassembly.
      <br/>
      Attachment tabs 79 (FIG. 3) extend perpendicularly from panel body 75 and include barbs 80 on their ends.
      <br/>
      The panel body 75 defines an arcuate slot or space 93 for receiving the protrusion 59 on the belt bracket flange 35.

      The outer sections 65 extend from the elbows 63 circumferentially but also radially inwardly, so that the outer ends 99 of the outer sections 65 are close to but spaced radially inward from the detent undulations 97.
      <br/>
      The outer ends 99 include holes 100 for receiving protrusions 101 on the drive ring 61.
      <br/>
      The drive ring 61 (FIG. 4) includes a panel body 102 that interconnects and supports the protrusions 101.
      <br/>
      A ribbed hole 103 in the panel body 102 of the drive ring 61 engages the ribbed outer surface 104 of a protrusion 94 on the knob 66.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The force adjusting device 50 operates as follows.
      <br/>
      The force multiplier including the gear arrangement is primarily located between or on housing 52 and base 51, while the clutch arrangement is located between or on handle knob 66 and housing 52.
      <br/>
      A biasing force in the spring 53 generates torque on the force adjusting device 50 for biasing the protrusion 59 of the belt bracket 34 toward a forward position where the lumbar section 29 protrudes forwardly.
      <br/>
      Also, when a person presses a lumbar portion of their lower back rearwardly in the chair 20, the protrusion 59 moves along slot 59' and additional torque is generated by the belt bracket flange 34' on the spring 53.
      <br/>
      The spring 53 is allowed to rotated within an angular rotation of about 90 degrees, as limited by the arcuate slot 59'. This lumbar-caused spring tension combines with biasing force in the spring 53 to torsionally bias the sun gear 55 that in turn applies a rotation force to the clutch 60.
      <br/>
      However, the clutch 60 does not slip because the torsional force of the spring 53 is communicated by the sun gear 55 to the clutch 60 at the clutch's center, which in turn is communicated by the inner section 64 of the legs 62 to the housing 52.
      <br/>
      The angle of the inner sections 64 to the depressions 67 in the housing 52 causes the clutch 60 to lock up, preventing unwanted rotation and "unwinding" of the spring 53.
      <br/>
      However, the force adjusting device 50 can be easily adjusted to increase or reduce pretension in the spring 53, because, when the knob 66 is rotated, a torsional force is applied through the drive ring 61 at locations spaced radially from a center of the clutch 60 at an angle that releases the clutch and lets the knob 66 rotate.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the adjusting force by the knob 66 is applied to the outer sections 65 of the legs 62.
      <br/>
      This adjusting force is applied at a different "flatter" angle, resulting in the clutch 60 allowing the clutch 60 and the sun gear 55 to rotate to selectively adjust the tension of the spring 53.
      <br/>
      The result is that the force adjusting device 50 can be easily adjusted in either direction by rotating the knob 66, yet the clutch withstands the torsional force generated by the spring 53 itself when in a selected position or by the spring in combination with torsional forces from movement of forwardly extending flanges 35 due to flexure of the lumbar section 29.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The knob 66 includes a first stop 70 (FIG. 4) and the housing, 52 includes a second stop 71 (FIG. 3) that slip past each other during rotation of the knob 66.
      <br/>
      However, an interference member 72 is shaped to ride along a shelf 73 on the sidewall 82 of housing 52 until it engages both stops 70 and 71.
      <br/>
      By this arrangement, the knob 66 can be turned rotationally almost two times completely around (i.e., about 700 degrees).
      <br/>
      The reason is because the interference member 72 engages adjacent sides of the stops 70 and 71, but then does not re-engage the other sides of the stops 70 and 71 until the knob 66 has been rotated almost completely around twice.
      <br/>
      This double rotation in combination with the gear arrangement of gears 55, 56, and 56' provides excellent mechanical advantage, making movement of the knob 66 to adjust a tension of the spring 53 relatively easy.
