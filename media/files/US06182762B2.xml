      A method and apparatus for temporarily storing the lower portion of a string of drill pipe in a well which has a cased portion wherein a packer, installed between a storm valve located below the packer and an actuator located above the packer, is set in the annulus between the drill pipe and the well casing, the actuator being designed to close the valve upon initial axial movement of the upper portion of the drill pipe, and then to become disengaged from the lower portion of the set drill pipe allowing the remaining surface suspended drill pipe and actuator to be retrieved as in the case of a floating drill ship or set aside for reconnection and reopening of the storm valve after a storm has passed.

    <heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
    <p num="1">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/059,809 filed Sep. 24, 1997.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention is related in general to offshore well drilling, and in particular to a storm valve that closes a passage of a string of drill pipe, allowing the drill pipe to be stored within a cased portion of a well during a storm.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      In offshore drilling, if a severe storm alert occurs, it may be necessary to evacuate the platform.
      <br/>
      If a well is being drilled, it is preferable to store the string of drill pipe within the cased portion of the hole, rather than pulling the string to the surface and leaving it on the drilling rig.
      <br/>
      In doing so, the drill string must be pulled up sufficiently high so that it is fully contained within the cased portion of the well.
      <br/>
      A packer will be set in the annulus surrounding the drill pipe.
      <br/>
      A valve in the drill string closes the passage.
      <br/>
      The packer has a hanger mechanism that supports the weight of the drill string in the well.
      <br/>
      The portion of the drill string above the valve is retrieved.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      While this technique is workable, the valve must be open while the drill string is run into the well, then closed.
      <br/>
      Closing the valve in the drill string can be a problem, particularly with floating drilling vessels.
    </p>

      <br/>
      Retainer pin 39 extends into a slot 41 that is elongated axially to allow limited upward and downward movement of mandrel upper portion 23 relative to collet member 35.
      <br/>
      In the position shown in FIG. 2B, retainer pin 39 will not allow any upward movement of mandrel upper portion 23 relative to collet member 35, but will allow downward movement.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A lock member 43 is located in head 37 above retainer pin 39.

      In the position shown in FIG. 2B, lock member 43 is held in an outer position due to engagement with a land 46 located between slot 41 and lock recess 47.
      <br/>
      When mandrel upper portion 23 moves downward relative to collet member 35, lock member 43 will snap into lock recess 47 as shown in FIG. 3B. In this position, collet member 35 and mandrel upper portion 23 are no longer axially moveable relative to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Collet member 35 has a plurality of inward biased depending fingers 49.
      <br/>

      Fingers 49 have a set of external threads 51 that engage threads 53 located in the interior of an upper housing portion 55.
      <br/>
      While in engagement with threads 53, fingers 49 lock collet member 35 to upper housing portion 55.
      <br/>
      Fingers 49 are moveable to a disengaged position out of engagement with threads 53 as shown in FIG. 3B. A plurality of torque members 50 are formed integrally on mandrel upper portion 23.
      <br/>
      Slots (not shown) are located between torque members 50 for slidably receiving portions of fingers 49.
      <br/>
      Rotating drill pipe 13 and thus mandrel upper portion 23 will cause fingers 49 to rotate to unscrew from threads 53.
      <br/>
      Preferably torque members 50 are utilized only in the event of an emergency.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Mandrel upper portion 23 has a set of external threads 57 on its lower end, shown in FIG. 2B, which secure it to a mandrel intermediate portion 59.

      Mandrel intermediate portion 59 has an external conical cam surface 61 on its upper end.
      <br/>
      Cam surface 61 engages a mating cam surface in the interior of collet fingers 49.
      <br/>
      In the position shown in FIG. 2B, cam surface 61 prevents fingers 49 from disengaging threads 53.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3B, the lower position of mandrel intermediate portion 59 places cam surface 61 farther from the mating cam surface on fingers 49, allowing fingers 49 to spring away from threads 53, detaching collet 35 from upper housing portion 55.
      <br/>
      Mandrel intermediate portion 59 has a shoulder 62 which lands on a mating shoulder 64 in the bore of upper housing portion 55.

      Outer sleeve portion 73 has external threads 75 that engage internal threads on the lower end of lower housing portion 67.
      <br/>
      Outer valve sleeve 73 has a flow port 77 in its side wall which communicates with an annulus 79 or flowby passage.
      <br/>
      Annulus 79 is located between the outer diameter of outer valve sleeve 73 and an inner diameter of intermediate housing portion 69.
      <br/>
      Annulus 79 also communicates with drill pipe internal passage 15 (FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      A plug 81 is secured to the bottom of outer valve sleeve 73 by threaded retainer pin 83.
      <br/>
      Plug 81 blocks an interior passage 82 that extends continuously through outer valve sleeve 73, mandrel lower portion 63, mandrel intermediate portion 59, mandrel upper portion 23 and into drill pipe passage 15 (FIG. 1) above storm valve 21.
      <br/>
      An inner valve sleeve 85 is slidingly carried within outer valve sleeve 73.
      <br/>
      Inner valve sleeve 85 has a flow port 87 through its side wall that will register with flow port 77 while inner valve sleeve 85 is in the open position as shown in FIG. 2D. While in the open position, drill pipe passage 15 below storm valve 21 communicates with passage 15 above storm valve 21 (FIG. 1) by way of annulus 79 (FIG. 2D), flow ports 87, 77 and valve flow passage 82.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Inner valve sleeve 85 has a valve connector on its upper end made up of a set of collet fingers 89 extending upward from it.
      <br/>
      Collet fingers 89 are biased outwardly and have enlarged heads at the upper ends.
      <br/>
      The enlarged heads of fingers 89 locate within an annular groove 91 formed in the outer diameter of mandrel lower portion 63.
      <br/>
      The radial thickness of each head 90 is greater than the radial clearance between outer diameter 95 of mandrel lower portion 63 and inner diameter 93 of intermediate housing portion 67.
      <br/>
      This traps heads 90 within groove 91, preventing inner valve sleeve 85 from moving downward with outer valve sleeve 85 the inner valve sleeve moves upward to the position shown in FIG. 3D. As shown in FIG. 2C, a retainer, such as recess 97 is located at the junction between intermediate housing portion 67 and upper housing portion 55.
      <br/>
      Recess 97 has a greater inner diameter than inner diameter 93, allowing heads 90 of fingers 89 to spring farther outward as shown in FIGS. 3C and 3D. In the outer position, the inner diameters of heads 90 will be spaced slightly outward from outer diameter 95 of mandrel lower portion 63.
      <br/>
      This allows mandrel lower portion 63 to move upwardly relative to inner valve sleeve 85 as fingers 89 will be disengaged.

    <p num="16">
      In operation, if it is necessary to store drill pipe 13 in casing 11 due to an approaching storm, the operator will pull drill pipe 13 up to a point that leaves a length of drill pipe in the well which is less than the length of casing 11.
      <br/>
      The operator installs into drill string 13 a conventional packer 19 of a type that sets by rotating.
      <br/>
      The operator installs storm valve 21 above packer 19.
      <br/>
      Storm valve 21 will be in an open position as shown in FIGS. 2A-2D. The operator lowers the assembly in the well on drill pipe 13 until storm valve 21 is located at a selected depth within casing 11.
      <br/>
      The operator then sets packer 19 by rotation.
      <br/>
      Once packer 19 is set, it will support the weight of drill string 13.
      <br/>
      The operator then slacks off the tension on drill string 13 above packer 19.
      <br/>
      Drill string 13 above packer 19 will begin moving downward.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 2B, mandrel portion 23 moves downward but housing 55 remains stationary as it will be supported by packer 19.
      <br/>
      The downward movement positions recess 47 adjacent lock member 43, causing lock member 43 to snap into recess 47 as shown in FIG. 3B. In the lower position, shoulder 62 will be resting on shoulder 64 as shown in FIG. 3B.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      During this downward movement, mandrel portions 59 and 63 will also move downward.
      <br/>
      Inner valve sleeve 85 will also move downward as groove 91 will push collet fingers 89 downward.
      <br/>
      In the lower position, shown in FIG. 3B, inwardly biased collet fingers 49 spring inward, disengaging from threads 53.
      <br/>
      The operator then picks up the drill string 13.
      <br/>
      This lifts collet 35 as well as moving inner valve sleeve 85 upward through the connection between collet fingers heads 90 and groove 91.
      <br/>
      Valve sleeve 85 will move to the closed position shown in FIG. 3D. Collet finger heads 90 will spring out into recess 97, disengaging inner valve sleeve 85 from mandrel lower portion 63.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The operator continues pulling upward, retrieving the portion of drill string 13 located above storm valve 21.
      <br/>
      Storm valve 21 will be closed with inner valve sleeve 85 and plug 81 blocking any flow up the drill string 13.
      <br/>
      Mandrel portions 23, 59 and 63 will be retrieved along with the drill string 13 located above storm valve 21.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the event that fingers 49 fail to disengage from threads 53 due to slacking off weight, the operator may release fingers 49 by rotating drill string 13.
      <br/>
      Threads 51, 53 are left-hand threads.
      <br/>
      Right hand rotation causes torque members 50 to rotate fingers 49 relative to upper housing portion 55, unscrewing threads 51 from threads 53.
      <br/>
      The operator then picks up the drill pipe and sleeve valve 85 will close in the same manner as previously described.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      When it is desired to resume drilling, the operator will remove lock member 43 and lower drill pipe 13 with mandrel portions 23, 59 and 63 on the lower end.
      <br/>
      Collet fingers 49 will stab into upper housing portion 55 adjacent threads 53.
      <br/>
      Mandrel lower portion 63 contacts finger heads 90, pushing inner sleeve 85 downward to open valve 21.
      <br/>
      Collet fingers 49 will move downward with mandrel upper portion 23 and engage cam surface 61.
      <br/>
      The operator rotates drill pipe 13 to the left to screw fingers 49 back into threads 53.
      <br/>
      The operator releases packer 19 (FIG. 1) and pulls drill string 13, along with storm valve 21.
      <br/>
      Cam surface 61 prevents threads 51 from disengaging from threads 53.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The invention has significant advantages.
      <br/>
      The invention allows an operator to store a sting of drill pipe within the cased portion of a hole, rather than pulling the entire drilling string to the surface.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the invention provides a way to easily close a valve within a drill string.
