    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to novel and water-soluble anthracycline derivatives which exhibit an excellent anticancer or antitumor activity at a low dosage thereof and which have 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl group as the sugar moiety.
      <br/>
      This invention also relates to processes for the preparation of said novel anthracycline derivatives and further to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same as an active ingredient.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl)daunomycinone and 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl)-adriamycinone or their acid addition salts as the novel and water-soluble anthracycline derivatives having an anticancer or antitumor activity and a low toxicity.
      <br/>
      This invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing the novel anthracycline derivative or an acid addition salt thereof.
      <br/>
      Further, this invention relates to processes for the preparation of these novel anthracycline derivatives.
      <br/>
      Yet further, this invention relates to a novel compound useful as an intermediate for the synthesis of these novel anthracycline derivatives.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">As antibiotics of the anthracycline type are known daunomycin which is also named daunorubicin in the specification of U.S. Pat. No. 3,616,242, as well as adriamycin which is also named doxorubicin in the specification of U.S. Pat. No. 3,590,028. These compounds have broad anticancer spectra against experimental tumors and have widely been utilized for clinical purposes as a chemotherapeutic anticancer agent.</p>
    <p num="3">
      While, daunomycin and adriamycin can exhibit a somewhat strong anticancer or antitumor activity against various kinds of cancers or tumors, but are not necessarily satisfactory as the anticancer agent or antitumor agent.
      <br/>
      That is, daunomycin and adriamycin have been utilized widely as a chemotherapeutic anticancer agent for clinical treatment of cancer-bearing patients, but they are also known to bring about serious side-effects such as leukocytopenia, alopecia, myocardiopathy and others, in many instances.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Therefore, it has hitherto been attempted to produce newly a variety of novel daunomycin-related compounds with the intention of providing such novel daunomycin-related compounds which would have a much enhanced anticancer or antitumor activity but with exhibiting a low toxicity.
      <br/>
      As some outcome of the attempts hitherto made, there have been proposed several compounds, for example, those known as aclacinomycins A and B; 4'-O-tetrahydropyranyl-adriamycin; N-monobenzyl- or N-dibenzyl-adriamycin.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Besides, U.S. Pat. No. 4,427,664 specification discloses 7-O-(3,4-di-O-acetyl-2,6-dideoxy-2-iodo- ALPHA -L-manno-hexopyranosyl)daunomycinone and 7-O- (3,4-di-O-acetyl-2,6-dideoxy-2-iodo- ALPHA -L-talo-hexopyranosyl)daunomycinone.</p>
    <p num="6">
      We, the present inventors, proceeded with our investigations in an attempt to provide novel derivatives of daunomycin and adriamycin which will exhibit a higher anticancer or antitumor activity than those of daunomycin or adriamycin but with a low toxicity.
      <br/>
      As a part of our investigations, we have already synthesized some derivatives of daunomycin and adriamycin in which the sugar moiety of daunomycin and adriamycin has been chemically modified.
      <br/>
      For example, the present inventors already reported 4'-O-tetrahydropyranyl-daunomycin or -adriamycin as well as 3'-deamino-3'-morpholino-daunomycin or -adriamycin.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Further, the present inventors succeeded in synthesizing such anthracycline derivatives having antitumor activities which are represented by the following general formula (A)  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="8">wherein Ra stands for a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, that is, 7-O-(2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl)-daunomycinone and 7-O-(2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl)-adriamycinone, which possess an anticancer or antitumor activity (see Japanese Patent Publication "Kokoku" Hei 6-31298 and European Patent No. 0230013).</p>
    <p num="9">The present inventors also succeeded in synthesizing such anthracycline derivatives having antitumor activities which are represented by the following general formula (B)  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="10">wherein R' stands for a group --(CH2)m --H where m is an integer of 1.about.6,or R' stands for a group --(CH2)n --COOH where n is an integer of 1.about.10 (see Japanese Patent Publication "Kokoku" Hei 7-42304 and European Patent No. 0275431).</p>
    <p num="11">The present inventors further succeeded in synthesizing such anthracycline derivatives having antitumor activities which are represented by the following general formula (C)  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="12">
      wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, R2 is a methoxy group or a hydrogen atom, and A and B each stand for a hydrogen atom or A and B as taken together form a chain of formula --CH2 --CH2 --O--CH2 --CH2 -- (see Japanese Patent Application First Publication "Kokai" Sho-64-203397).
      <br/>
      As examples of the anthracycline derivatives of the general formula (C), there may be mentioned 7-O-(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl)daunomycinone; 7-O-(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone; 7-O-(2,3,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro-3-morpholino- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone and others.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      7-O-(2,6-Dideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone, as one of the anthracycline derivatives of the general formula (A) given above, exhibits a remarkable antitumor activity, but is barely soluble in water, so that it had a difficulty in formulating into injection preparations.
      <br/>
      Then, the anthracycline derivatives of general formulae (B) and (C) above have been synthesized in an attempt to give such anthracycline derivatives which have an improved solubility in water.
      <br/>
      Amongst the derivatives of the general formula (C), 7-O-(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone is soluble in water, but the antitumor activity thereof has not been recognized to be remarkably higher than that of adriamycine, even though the former has the antitumor activity a little higher than that of the latter.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The present inventors further have continued our investigations in various ways with the intention of producing such novel anthracycline derivatives which can exhibit higher anticancer or antitumor activities than those of daunomycin, adriamycin and the antitumor anthracycline derivatives of the general formulae (A), (B) and (C) above, even at a low dosage, and which are of satisfactory solubility in water and of low toxicity.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The anticancer or antitumor activities of the anthracycline derivatives of the general formulae (A) and (B) above are, in fact, noticeably superior to those of daunomycin and adriamycin, but are not yet satisfactorily high enough.
      <br/>
      All of the anthracycline derivatives of the general formula (C) above are soluble in water, but most of those derivatives exhibit only an anticancer or antitumor activity substantially as high as or lower than that of adriamycin.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Therefore, there still exists a desire for providing such novel anthracycline derivatives which can exhibit higher anticancer or antitumor activities than those of the known anthracycline derivatives.
      <br/>
      Further, in general, it is always convenient for clinical applications to administer the anticancer or antitumor compounds in the form of injectable preparations.
      <br/>
      Thus, for the purpose of therapeutic treatments of a variety of cancers and tumors, a demand always exists in the art to provide and explore such novel anticancer or antitumor agents having a nature that they can exhibit a strong anticancer or antitumor activity but with low toxicity and also they are highly soluble in water.
    </p>
    <p num="17">In order to solve the problems above-mentioned, the present inventors have proceeded with our further investigations in an attempt to synthesize novel anthracycline derivatives having a new fluorinated amino-sugar moiety.</p>
    <p num="18">As a result of these further investigations, we have now succeeded in synthesizing 1-O-acetyl derivative of 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-mannopyranose and 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-mannopyranosyl bromide or their 3,4-di-O,N-protected derivatives as new compounds through a multi-step method with starting from methyl 4-O-benzyl-2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranoside which has been obtained in the synthesis of the anthracycline derivative of the general formula (A) shown hereinbefore (see the specification of Japanese patent application No. Hei-7-179621 filed Jun. 23, 1995 which is corresponding to PCT application No. PCT/JP96/01697 filed Jun. 19, 1996, now published under International publication No. WO 97/00880).</p>
    <p num="19">Then, by utilizing these 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-mannopyranose derivatives as synthesized for the first time and by taking such a method which comprises condensing the 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-mannopyranosyl group with the 7-hydroxyl group of daunomycinone or adriamycinone, we have earlier succeeded in synthesizing such novel daunomycinone derivative and adriamycinone derivative which are represented by the following general formula (D)  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="20">
      wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group or an acid addition salt thereof, as such anthracycline derivatives which bear as the sugar moiety a 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-mannopyranosyl group where the amino group at the 4-position of this sugar moiety is of the equatorial direction.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, we have found that the novel anthracycline derivatives of the general formula (D) above are soluble in water, that they exhibit a high anticancer or antitumor activity even when they are administered to test animals at low dosages, and that development of acute toxicity does not take place in the test animals having received the administration of the anthracycline derivative of the formula (D) at the low dosages which can give high anticancer or antitumor effects in the test animals so treated (see the aforesaid Japanese patent application No. Hei-7-179621).
    </p>
    <p num="21">The daunomycinone or adriamycinone derivative of the general formula (D) contains the equatorically directed amino group at the 4-position of the sugar moiety thereof, and particular examples thereof include Compound (a) and Compound (b) of the following formulae (D-a) and (D-b), respectively.</p>
    <p num="22">(1) Compound (a): 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-mannopyranosyl)daunomycinone of the following formula  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="23">(2) Compound (b): 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-mannopyranosyl)adriamycinone of the following formula  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="24">
      It has been confirmed through "in vivo" tests that, among the anthracycline derivatives of the general formula (D) above, 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-mannopyranosyl)adriamycinone of the formula (D-b) exhibits a remarkably high antitumor activity against experimental tumors in animals and has a remarkably improved antitumor activity against mouse Leukemia L-1210 cell over adriamycin even when the compound of the formula (D-b) is administered at low dosages.
      <br/>
      While, it has also been found that althoguh the compound of the formula (D-b) is soluble in water and exhibits the above-mentioned excellent antitumor activity against mouse Leukemia L-1210 cell, this compound as tested in "in vitro" tests remains to exhibit against various human cancer cells such anticancer activities which are substantially as high as those of adriamycin.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Accordingly, one of the objects of this invention is to provide and explore new anticancer anthracycline derivatives having such properties that they can exhibit an excellent anticancer or antitumor activity and especially exhibit a stronger anticancer activity against various human cancer cells than adriamycin but they have a low toxicity and a high solubility in water.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">In order to achieve the above objects of this invention, the present inventors have continued further investigations in an attempt to synthesize and provide such novel anthracycline derivatives which are able to have the above-mentioned excellent properties and contains a fluorinated amino-sugar moiety.</p>
    <p num="27">As a result of our further investigations above, the present inventors have now succeeded in synthesizing as new compounds, protected derivatives of 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro-L-talopyranose having the axially directed 4-amino group, as well as 3,4-di-O,N-protected derivatives of 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranocyl bromide through a multi-staged process with starting from 3,4-di-O-acetyl-2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl bromide which is a known compound described in the "Carbohydrate Research" Vol. 169, pages 69-81 (1987).</p>
    <p num="28">
      The present inventors also have now succeeded in synthetizing as a novel anthracycline derivative 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl)daunomycinone having the axially directed amino group at the 4-position of the sugar moiety thereof, by means of a process which comprises utilizing the above-mentioned derivatives of 4-amino-2,4,6-tridoexy-2-fluoro-L-talopyranose synthetized now newly as above, and condensing a 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl group with the 7-hydroxyl group of daunomycinone.
      <br/>
      The present inventors have now succeeded also in synthetizing as a novel anthracycline derivative 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone from the new daunomycinone derivative mentioned just above.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the present inventors have now found that the two particular, novel anthracycline derivatives now synthetized and specified just above have a high solubility in water to such extent that these novel two anthracycline derivatives can dissolve in amounts of 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively, per 1 ml of water, that these novel two anthracycline derivatives may be formulated into an aqueous injection preparation, and that these novel two anthracycline derivatives as administered even at low dosages are not only able to exhibit an antitumor activity against mouse Leukemia L-1210 cell to a degree substantially equal to or higher than that of adriamycin but also are able to exhibit remarkably improved anticancer activities against various human cancer cells in "in vitro" tests, in comparison with adriamycin.
      <br/>
      On the basis of these findings obtained by the present inventors, this invention has now been accomplished.
    </p>
    <p num="29">In a first aspect of this invention, therefore, there is provided a daunomycinone or adriamycinone derivative represented by the following general formula  (Chemical Structure image '8' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="30">wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof.</p>
    <p num="31">As examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the daunomycinone or adriamycinone derivative of the general formula (I), there are mentioned such acid addition salts which may be formed by reacting the 4'-amino group of said derivative with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, methanesulfonic acid in a usual manner.</p>
    <p num="32">Examples of the daunomycinone or adriamycinone derivatives of the general formula (I) include the under-mentioned Compound (a) and Compound (b) of this invention:</p>
    <p num="33">(1) Compound (a): 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl)daunomycinone (see Example 1 hereinafter given) represented by the following formula  (Chemical Structure image '9' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="34">(2) Compound (b): 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- ALPHA -L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone (see Example 2 hereinafter given) represented by the following formula  (Chemical Structure image '10' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="35">Now, some Test Examples are given to illustrate the antitumor activities of Compound (a) of formula (Ia) and Compound (b) of formula (Ib) shown above, which are embraced by the anthracycline derivatives of the general. formula (I) according to the first aspect of this invention.</p>
    <p num="36">TEST EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="37">In this Example, some tests were made to demonstrate antitumor activities of the compounds of this invention shown against leukemia in CDF1 mice as induced by a mouse leukemia, Leukemia L-1210 cells.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Thus, to evaluate the antitumor effects of the novel compounds of this invention against experimental tumors in animals, CDF1 mice (four mice per group) were intraperitoneally inoculated with cells of Leukemia L-1210 at an amount of 1 * 105 cells/mouse.
      <br/>
      Since an elapse of 24 hours from the inoculation of the leukemia cells, a test compound of this invention was administered intraperitoneally to the mice under test once a day for consecutive 9 days, with the test compound being given as its hydrochloride in the form of a solution in a physiological saline.
      <br/>
      The mice so treated were observed for 60 days after the administration of the test compound.
      <br/>
      In the meanwhile, mice of the control group (the untreated group) were administered only with physiological saline after the inoculation of the L-1210 cells.
      <br/>
      During the observation period, the number of the surviving mice was counted for both the treated group and the control group, and the mean survival days of mice of both the treated group and the control group were calculated.
      <br/>
      Then, the percentages (%) of the increase in the life-span of the treated mice was estimated, as T/C (%), in terms of the mean survival day (C) of the untreated mice of the control group and the mean survival day (T) of the treated mice of the treated group.
      <br/>
      For comparison purposes, similar tests were effected using daunomycin (as hydrochloride) and adriamycin (as hydrochloride).
      <br/>
      The test results are shown in Table 1 below.
      <br/>
      The mean survival day of mice of the control group (the untreated group) was 8 to 9 days, and the mean survival day of mice of the comparative groups having received the administration of daunomycin or adriamycin usually varied dependently on the dosage of the compound tested.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In Table 1 below, the symbol "&gt;" indicates that, among the four mice under test which were inoculated with the tumor cells and then administered with the compound under test, there existed at least one mouse which could be cured and survived for 60 days or longer by the administration of the test compound in spite of their received inoculation of tumor cell.
      <br/>
      Incidentally, in respect of the fractional numbers parenthesized below the numerical values of increase (%) in the life-span, the denominator of the fraction denotes the number of mice tested in one test group but the numerator of the fraction denotes the number of mice which survived for 60 days or longer.

      In the "in vivo" tests as described above, the daunomycinone derivative of general formula (I) according to the first aspect of this invention, namely Compound (a) of this invention as given at a dosage in a range of 0.6.about.1.25 mg/kg was able to exhibit antitumor activities higher than those of daunomycin.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, it is found that Compound (b) of this invention, namely the adriamycin derivative as given at a low dosage in a range of 0.3 mg/kg.about 0 (slashed zero) 6 mg/kg was able to exhibit such remarkably high antitumor activities that the percentage of the increase in the life-span (T/C), %) was as high as a value of greater than 400% to a value of greater than 403% and that the number of the mice surviving for 60 days (the mice as fully cured from the leukemia) amounted to two in eight.
      <br/>
      This indicates that Compound (b) given at a dosage of 0.3.about 0 (slashed zero) 6 mg/kg was able to exhibit markedly enhanced anticancer or antitumor activities, as compared with those of adriamycin as given at a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg.about 0 (slashed zero) 6 mg/kg.
      <br/>
      It is also found that Compound (b) of this invention as given at the low dosage of 0.3 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg did not involve the development of toxicity.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is found that Compound (b) of this invention as given at a low dosage of 0.15 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg was able to exhibit remarkably enhanced anticancer or antitumor activities in terms of percentages of the increase in the life-span of the treated mice (T/C, %), in comparison with daunomycin.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Daunomycin or adriamycin used as the comparative drug in the above Test Example 1 is an anticancer agent which has been used clinically and practically administered to human beings at a dosage in the range of 0.4 mg/kg.about.2 mg/kg in dependent upon the nature of cancers to be treated.
      <br/>
      When daunomycin or adriamycin is administered at a dosage ranging from 2.5 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day to such mice as inoculated with the L-1210 cancer cells, daunomycin or adriamycin exhibits an anticancer or antitumor activities which amount to percentages of increase in the life-span (T/C, %) of 138%.about.273% or of about 330% at maximum, respectively, with being accompanied by the development of toxicity.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      It is to be noticed that, in contrast to daunomycin or adriamycin, the adriamycinone derivative of the formula (Ib), namely Compound (b) of this invention, when administered at a proper low dosage in the range of 0.3.about 0 (slashed zero) 6 mg/kg/day to the mice as inoculated with the L-1210 cancer cells, is able to exhibit such extremely excellent antitumor effects that the development of toxicities is not involved, while the attainable values of percentages of increase in the life-span (T/C, %) are markedly higher than those attainable by daunomycin or adriamycin, and that particularly, the percentages of increase in the life-span can amount to about 400% or higher with involving a complete cure.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, Compounds (a) and (b) of this invention, particularly Compound (b), have such advantage that significant antitumor effects can be expected to be attained by them even when they are administered at a not too high dosage to the cancer-bearing patients for clinical treatments.
