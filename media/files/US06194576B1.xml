      The present invention relates to new nucleotide analogues.
      <br/>
      Particularly, it is concerned with the use of 2-phosphonate-nucleotide analogues in the treatment of viral infections.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is recognized as an important pathogen in patients with AIDS.
      <br/>
      The virus often contributes to the immunosuppression observed in such patients and may cause disseminated disease involving the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, or eyes.
      <br/>
      CMV retinitis is recognized as an important cause of blindness in patients with AIDS.
      <br/>
      Also, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is a major cause of death in AIDS patients.
      <br/>
      Currently, there are only two approved drugs, ganciclovir and foscarnet, for its treatment.
      <br/>
      Ganciclovir has exhibited bone marrow suppression as a serious side effect and resistant strains have also been isolated.
      <br/>
      Foscarnet presents side effects that are associated with its administration such as reversible renal dysfunction, thrombophlebitis at the infusion site, headaches and anemia.
      <br/>
      Also, foscarnet is not orally bioavailable, limiting its utility in clinical treatment.
      <br/>
      It is poorly soluble, and large doses are required because of its relatively low potency.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the development of a potent and non-toxic anti-CMV agents is highly desired.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      All human herpesviruses have a worldwide distribution and are amongst the most difficult human pathogens to control.
      <br/>
      Currently, considerable efforts are being directed towards the development of vaccines and antiviral agents that will be active against herpesviruses, particularly Herpes Simplex viruses HSV-1 and HSV-2.
      <br/>
      A number of nucleoside and nucleotide derivatives are active against primary and recurrent HSV infection; of these, acyclovir is the most used drug.
      <br/>
      However, among patients with AIDS, acyclovir-resistant HSV-2 may lead to chronic progressive infections.
      <br/>
      There is therefore a need for development of a potent and non-toxic agent against HSV-1 and HSV-2.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Since their discovery in 1986, the acyclic phosphonate nucleotide analogs have generated considerable attention as broad spectrum antiviral agents.
      <br/>
      The guanine analogues HPMPG and PMEG, the adenine analogues HPMPA, and the cytosine analogue HPMPC have been shown to exhibit good anti-HCMV activity and HSV activity.
      <br/>
      PMEA has also demonstrated in vitro activity against retroviruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as DNA viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), and in vivo activity against murine cytomegalovirus (CMV).  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)

      The steps illustrated in Scheme 3 can be briefly described as follows:
      <br/>
      a) Both hydroxy groups of compound (IX) were sequentially converted to form compound (IVa) where W' and W" are similar or different functional groups;
      <br/>
      b) The W' functionality of compound (IVa) was then converted to a 2-dialkylphosphonate derivative (IIe) under Arbuzov conditions by treatment with trialkyl phosphite with or without the presence of a Lewis acid (such as TiCl4) as a catalyst.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, when W' is a displaceable group, the coupling reaction may be carried out under Michaelis-Becker conditions using O.dbd.P(ORv)2- M.sym. wherein M is a metal (such as Li, Na, or K);
      <br/>
      - At this stage, the compound of formula (IIc) may be optionally separated to its cis and trans isomers before further steps were carried out;
      <br/>
      c) After the function W' had been modified to a displaceable group W (if necessary), the compound (IIe) is condensed with a purine or pyrimidine base, modified or not, derivative or analogue thereof (R2'), to yield (Ii) which is an ester of the compound of formula (I).
      <br/>
      - At this stage, R2 can be converted to another R2 if necessary.
      <br/>
      Also, if R15 ' and R16 ' are W', they may be independently deprotected to R15 and R16.
      <br/>
      d) Once made, esters (Ii) are converted to the corresponding phosphonate derivative of formula (Ij) as described in Schemes 1 and 2.
