    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This application is to further precisely defining the variation and enhancement of U.S. patent application No. 08/812,530 filed Mar. 8, 1997.</p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates generally to apparatus for facilitating a user to select, coordinate, appraise and harmonize garment clothing without actually putting on the garment.</p>
    <p num="4">
      The prior art reveals many garment hangers having a facial drawing combined with a garment hanger for store display purposes.
      <br/>
      For example only, attention is directed to the following U.S. Pat. Nos:
    </p>
    <p num="5">Des. 253,447 1,096,018 3,126,237 4,739,911</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention is firstly directed to an apparatus especially configured to encourage children to produce and display handicraft works while also encouraging them to properly care for their articles of clothing, as disclosed in applicant's issued U.S. Pat. No. 5,649,651. The embodiments of the invention include a frame member defining a display region configured for removably accommodating a child's handicraft.
      <br/>
      In a first preferred embodiment, the frame member is especially configured for accommodating a substantially planar, i.e., two dimensional, handicraft in the display region.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In accordance with the preferred embodiments, first and second elongate arms extend in opposite directions from the frame member for supporting articles of clothing.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a hook member extends from the frame member for vertically suspending the frame member from a horizontally oriented support surface, e.g., on a stationary hook, a door top, or a rod.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In accordance with the first embodiment, the frame member defines the periphery of a display area for accommodating a substantially planar handicraft having a decorative front face of a person or a cartoon character.
      <br/>
      The handicraft may include different forms of presentation such as a picture, drawing, painting, photograph or needlework.
      <br/>
      The concept of handicraft includes the formation of art, picture, facial illustrations with the support of computers, computer software, computer printer as means to form the personalized handicraft.
      <br/>
      The frame member preferably includes a backing panel and a transparent display panel.
      <br/>
      The display panel is preferably configured for removable mounting on the frame member thus allowing the handicraft to be placed between the backing and display panels with its decorative front face visible through the transparent display panel.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      An enhancement of this prior art may be in the form of a photograph representing the life-size visual representation of a particular user's face.
      <br/>
      Such apparatus can be especially featured to provide an unusual application so as to assist the user in selecting clothing articles which coordinate to form an attractive outfit for that user.
      <br/>
      It is known in the art to provide facilities in tourist spots to capture user's facial illustration by photographic techniques and print the facial image in reduced size on a plate, mug or T-shirt for souvenir purpose.
      <br/>
      The concept of the invention can be readily extended to provide a garment hanger equipped with a life-size facial illustration of the user in these tourist spots so as to provide a more meaningful and useful souvenir.
      <br/>
      Another application of the invention is for an apparel retail shop to instantly capture the life size facial image of the preferred customer and print it on the medial portion of a garment hanger.
      <br/>
      The customer then make use of this special apparatus to support and coordinate their selected apparel and has a quick appraisal of the harmony effect with his/her face on it without actually putting on the apparel.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In accordance of a third embodiment, the invented apparatus can be configured to receive a regular garment hanger supporting an apparel.
      <br/>
      This design enables the customer to have an instant viewing of the apparel to see if it matches with his/her face without removing the garment from its hanger and put it onto the first embodiment for displaying with a facial image of the user.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In accordance of another preferred embodiment, the frame member is configured in the form of a stand.
      <br/>
      A display region is formed proximate to the top of the stand for the displaying a personalized facial image.
      <br/>
      Receiver means such as hooks or receiver slots are provided behind the display region to receive the hook of a garment hanger.
      <br/>
      For a user to coordinate or appraise the look with particular garment, the garment supported on regular hanger is attached to one of the receiver means to suspend the garment such that the garment looks to be wear by the user.
      <br/>
      The receiver means can be configured to enable vertical position adjustment so that the relative position of the garment from the facial image of the user can be adjusted to a proper location.
      <br/>
      A simple way to enable vertical adjustment is to offer more than one receiver hooks, one on top of another.
      <br/>
      For the apparatus to be used in a fashion store, in order to facilitate changing the facial image for different customers, the facial image is recommended to be printed onto a cardboard instead of printing directly onto the display region.
      <br/>
      This cardboard is then attached with the display member by attachment means such as double side tape or magnetic materials.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In order to provide a personalized facial image for a customer, the fashion store is equipped with a camera, the facial image of the customer is captured and digitized into electronics data.
      <br/>
      A code word is assigned to distinguish the digital image of one customer from another.
      <br/>
      Instead of interchangeably displaying the facial image onto the display apparatus, this facial image can be permanently printed onto a garment hanger having an adequately large display region located on top of the garment hanger and make it a personalized coordination apparatus.
      <br/>
      This personalized coordination apparatus is an invaluable hospitality facility for a frequent customer than the floor standing version.
      <br/>
      The customer may carry the personalized hanger around different areas of the store, and try different desirable apparel without actually putting on the apparel on.
      <br/>
      The set up increase the efficiency for customers to check the matching of apparel and encourage them to try more different designs without actually putting the apparel on.
      <br/>
      As a result a store with limited space can handle a greater customer flow because the time spent by a customer to complete the transaction is reduced.
      <br/>
      The number of changing rooms required the customer's shopping requirements is also reduced.
      <br/>
      The room efficiency is particular important for stores having a limited floor space.
      <br/>
      Another advantage is that some garment of special nature such as T-shirt of delicate material is not recommended to be tested as they tend to be deformed by customers.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The term personalize is important to distinguish the invention with the prior art having a hanger and a facial drawing displayed at the medial portion of the hanger, such as Tully, U.S. Design Pat.
      <br/>
      No. 253,447. In addition to the photo facial image of the user, this garment coordination apparatus is differentiated from the prior art with an important personalized nature.
      <br/>
      That is, the hanger created for one person may not be suitable for another person.
      <br/>
      A personalized coordination apparatus is a process with which a consumer has the right of choice which real person face image to be put onto the display region, most situations the facial image selected is that of the consumer, relatives, friends or other specifically selected person.
      <br/>
      The personalized process is defined by any of the following characteristics when compared with a commercial display hanger having a facial drawing.
      <br/>
      In a first situation, the facial image of the coordination apparatus is owned by the owner of the coordination apparatus, or it belongs to the person known to the consumer, such as relatives and known friends.
      <br/>
      Secondly, mostly one or two pieces of the coordination apparatus is required per owner; this property is distinctive with commercial displaying hangers having the same unique beautifully designed face made in high number of quantity.
      <br/>
      The image of choice is another characteristic of the subject invention.
      <br/>
      Consumer has a desire to possess the coordination apparatus because it has the facial image of choice.
      <br/>
      Commercial displaying hanger does not provide choice of facial image for the consumer.
      <br/>
      Fourthly, a personalized coordination apparatus invented will be fully utilized by it's owner, no matter if the facial image displayed is not outstanding, or not beautiful as judged by the common standard.
      <br/>
      Only beautifully designed facial image will be used for commercial displaying hangers.
      <br/>
      Fifthly, regarding to the location of use, the coordination apparatus is used by the owner at the store and also at home.
      <br/>
      This is significantly different when compared with commercial display hanger which is used only in stores.
      <br/>
      The sixth characteristic is that commercial display hanger are used to support the displaying garment hanger for an extended period of time whereas the personalized coordination apparatus is used only for short moments when it is used for coordination or appraising the matching effect of a garment.
      <br/>
      The seventh characteristic is that a special set up kiosk is required to be set up around a point of sale for a store to offer the invented personalized coordination service to all the customers.
      <br/>
      Commercial display hanger does not required a servicing kiosk because only one most pleasant looking face is required to be selected.
      <br/>
      The number eight characteristic is that proper coding system about the facial image is required by the subject invention to distinguish one face from another.
      <br/>
      As only the most desirable facial image is selected for the commercial display hanger, coding number is not required to represent the face selected.
      <br/>
      Another characteristic is that consumer usually may be required to pay for the personalized coordination apparatus while commercial display hanger is usually not for sale in a store.
      <br/>
      Any of these process characteristics defines the nature of the term "personalize" of the invented coordination apparatus, and distinguishes the subtle differences from a commercial display hanger.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Structurally, although a traditional garment hanger hook is applicable to carry the apparatus, a flat and comfortable handle is a more preferable design.
      <br/>
      In order to provide a friendly personalized service for different people, an efficient photo imaging process is required at a point of sale.
      <br/>
      A typical set up providing this service starts with a photo imaging device such as camera.
      <br/>
      Facilities to chroma-key and digitize the facial image such as scanner and also special photo treating software are also required.
      <br/>
      Alternatively digital camera can be used to replace the regular camera and scanner combination.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In a different embodiment, the display member is enhanced to a display monitor, such as a computer monitor with thin border.
      <br/>
      A thin profile LCD monitor is particularly suitable for this application.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, garment-supporting arms are positioned just below the computer monitor which displays the facial image of the customer.
      <br/>
      In another preferred embodiment receiver means is provided behind the computer monitor to receive the hook of a garment hanger which supports the garment to be viewed.
      <br/>
      Since computer monitors are expensive and bulky to be carried around, it is preferable to have the monitor mounted on a floor stand.
      <br/>
      A preferred process to make use of this facility is as follow:
      <br/>
      (1) Provide a facial image capture set up at a point of sale.
      <br/>
      (2) Facial image of customers are collected with this setup.
      <br/>
      (3) The facial image is digitized into electronics data represented by numbers of 1 and 0; and stored in a file.
      <br/>
      (4) A code word or file name is assigned to each file to identify the facial image of one customer from another.
      <br/>
      (5) The file is decoded and displayed on the computer monitor mounted on top of the garment displaying stand.
      <br/>
      (6) Input device such as key pad, joystick, mouse or other point device and even voice recognition device are used to identify which facial image is to be displayed and also to provide adjustment, options selection and modification of the facial image or the relative position of the image to be displayed.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Various facial image modification software are available in the market to change the color balance, provide visual effect and touch up deficiencies in the photo taking process.
      <br/>
      With more investment, multiple facial images of the customer from different viewing angles can be collected.
      <br/>
      In this situation, the display stand requires rotation means for the viewing garment to be rotated when the orientation of the facial image is changed.
      <br/>
      If multiple facial images are collected at a high frame rate such as 25 frames per second while the viewing angle is continuously changing, the playback of the facial image at the monitor will provide a movie like movement result.
      <br/>
      To fully match with the movie play back effect, such as a head is turning left or right, the garment displaying mechanism is required to be moved in the same direction and in synchronization with the head turning motion displayed.
      <br/>
      The overall result becomes an animated presentation of the garment coordination matching with the user.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Once a customer registered his/her facial image at a face image capturing facility, this image file identified by a code word can be sent to a remote computer by a communication channel.
      <br/>
      A network or communication channel refer to any means connecting two computing devices together, including internet, intranet, extranet, ISDN, DSL and LAN.
      <br/>
      The communication channel can be provided by wired lines such as cable, optical lines or telephone lines.
      <br/>
      It can be connected to the computer by any commercially format of communication such as COM port, parallel port and USB port.
      <br/>
      The communication channel can be furnished by wireless channel such as RF and infra red channels as well.
      <br/>
      A fashion store may also set up a library of images representing its garment collection at the remote computer.
      <br/>
      Garment images can be created by the same process to capture the electronics image file of a facial image; partially or completely created by image drafting software commercially available.
      <br/>
      With this service, customers may access the web site of the fashion store from the internet or the world wide web to fetch the file representing their facial images and/or the images of the garment to be selected.
      <br/>
      With the support of a proper software, the facial image of the customer and the garment can be combined and displayed on the computer monitor located at the home of the potential customer.
      <br/>
      Personalized animated fashion show is also possible if multiple facial images and the garment are provided.
      <br/>
      This service gives customers greater confidence before they placed mail orders and avoid returns.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, customers may preview their preferred garment, and coordinated with their facial image.
      <br/>
      After customers record their preference, they either place a mail order or go to a store to actually try their short listed preferences and then confirm their purchase.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="20">
      Attention is initially directed to FIG. 1 which depicts an exploded view of a first embodiment 10 in accordance with the invention particularly configured to encourage a child to create and display a handicraft while also encouraging that child to properly care for his/her articles of clothing.
      <br/>
      The apparatus 10 is comprised of a frame member 12.
      <br/>
      The frame member 12 is formed by a substantially rigid peripheral member 14 which frames a display area 16.
      <br/>
      The peripheral member 14 is bridged by a backing panel 18.
      <br/>
      Holes 20 are preferably formed in the backing panel 18 to facilitate the removable mounting of a handicraft 24 in the display area 16 overlaying the backing panel 18.
      <br/>
      A suspension or hook member 90 extends radially outward from the frame member 12 for vertically suspending the structural member from a horizontally oriented supporting surface (not shown) such as a wall mounted hook, a door top, or a horizontal rod.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The handicraft 24 can comprise any of various planar structures having a front face 26 bearing a decorative pattern 28.
      <br/>
      The invention contemplates a great variety of decorative patterns and techniques for their formation.
      <br/>
      For example only, the handicraft 24 can comprise a picture, drawing, painting, photograph or needlework dimensioned to fit within the periphery defined by peripheral member 14.
      <br/>
      In perhaps its simplest form, the pattern 28 can be a hand drawing formed on a blank piece of paper.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, as will be discussed hereinafter, the pattern can be formed by various other art or craft techniques such as cutting out preprinted elements and adhering them to a base sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As will be discussed hereinafter, it is intended that the handicraft 24 to be displayed be mounted against the backing panel 18 within the periphery defined by peripheral member 14.
      <br/>
      A transparent display panel 34 is provided and is intended for mounting on the frame member 12, sandwiching the handicraft 24 between the display panel 34 and backing panel 18, with the front face 26 of the handicraft 24 visible through the transparent display panel 34.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The display panel 34 is preferably provided with radially extending tabs 38 dimensioned and located to be removably received within mating slots 40 defined between the backing panel 18 and the peripheral member 14.
      <br/>
      The frame member 12 is configured for attachment to a device 50 for supporting clothing articles.
      <br/>
      The device 50 essentially is comprised of first and second arms 52, 54 which extend outwardly in opposite directions from a medial member 56.
      <br/>
      More particularly, arm 52 has a first end 58 secured to medial member 56 and a second substantially free end 60.
      <br/>
      Similarly, arm 54 has a first or inner end 62 secured to medial member 56 and a second free end 64.
      <br/>
      Ends 60 and 64 are preferably bridged by a bar 66 carrying spring urged clips 68, 70 suitable for holding a lower garment such as a skirt or trousers.
      <br/>
      Extender members 72 and 74 are respectively mounted on arms 52 and 54 for extending the effective width of the device 50 to enable the device to grow with a child as the child's clothing size increases.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the device 50 is an embodiment to represent means to support a garment.
      <br/>
      Any realistic structure suitable for supporting a garment for display such as a frame is also include in the definition of the garment supporting means.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The frame member 12 is provided with a mounting member 76 for attaching the frame member to the device 50.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the mounting member 76 comprises a bifurcated stud 78 extending radially outward from the peripheral member 14.
      <br/>
      The stud is bifurcated by slot 80 which forms portions 82, 84 which can be resiliently urged together to enable them to pass into a slot (not shown) formed in medial member 56 for securing frame member 12 to device 50.
      <br/>
      A hook member 90 having a shaft 92 also extends radially from the peripheral member 14, substantially diametrically displaced from the mounting stud 78.
      <br/>
      When the embodiment is used to display life size human face photograph of the user to coordinate or appraise selection of apparel, the frame member (display member) 12 and the garment supporting device 50 are preferably to be separated parts to be attached together for use.
      <br/>
