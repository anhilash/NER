    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a liquid crystal device, especially to a reflection type liquid crystal device and a transflective type liquid crystal device.
      <br/>
      The present invention further relates to portable telephones, watches and information processing devices equipped with this liquid crystal device.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      While most of the conventional refection type liquid crystals devices display a black image on a white background, a black (or other colors such as blue) display on a clearly colored background is desired depending on its use.
      <br/>
      For example, it is well known that a black display on an yellow background is more recognizable than a black display on a white display, which is utilized in traffic signs.
      <br/>
      Display images such as black on a green background, black on a blue background, black on a pink background, blue on an yellow background and blue on a dark background are also appreciated mainly for the convenience of design.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that these background colors have brilliant luster.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Many method have been proposed to obtained color display images as described above.
      <br/>
      These methods utilize, for example, birefringent interference of ECB and STN, colored polarizers, diachronic dye and selective reflection of cholesteric liquid crystals.
      <br/>
      These conventional methods are described in the seventh chapter of "Handbook of Liquid Crystal Device (published by Nikkan Kogyo Shinbun Co.)" in detail.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      These methods for displaying color images by the conventional liquid crystal devices have not been widely used by the reasons that the display images becomes dark, colors of the display images are limited, the reliability of display images are deteriorated or the production of the display devices is difficult.
      <br/>
      Besides, it was another problem that the reflective display images becomes dark when the transflective type display is performed by the conventional display device.
    </p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a reflective and a transflective liquid crystal device for practical use that can display bright and brilliant colors.</p>
    <p num="6">The liquid crystal display according to the present invention comprises a liquid crystal panel comprising a pair of substrates between which a liquid crystal is inserted; a first polarizer provided at one side of the liquid crystal panel, not transmitting light having the first predetermined polarization components and transmitting light having predetermined polarization components being different than said first predetermined polarization components; and a reflective polarizer provided on the opposite side to the first polarizer relative to the liquid crystal panel, reflecting light having second predetermined polarization components at limited wavelength range within visible light, and transmitting light having predetermined polarization components being different than said second predetermined polarization components, and light having said second predetermined polarization components at wavelength range outside of said limited wavelength range within said visible light.</p>
    <p num="7">
      According to such construction, the colored images are displayed in case that light at limited wavelength range which is included in ambient light entering liquid crystal display is reflected by reflective polarizer, then transmit the first polarizer, and same color images as the background color of the reflective polarizer are displayed in case that ambient light entering liquid crystal display transmits the reflective polarizer.
      <br/>
      When a light absorption layer is provided at the back of the reflective polarizer, black images are displayed since the light transmitting the reflective polarizer is absorbed by the light absorption layer.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The wavelength range of the visible light is generally defined to be, as described in "wavelength limit of the visible radiation" in JIS Z 8113-1988, between 360 nm and 400 nm in the short wavelength side and between 760 nm and 830 nm in the long wavelength side.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the limited wavelength range of the visible light means a part of the range from 360 nm to 400 nm or from 760 nm to 830 nm, approximately several tens nm to several hundreds nm.
      <br/>
      The limited wavelength range does not have to be a continuous wavelength range.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      By selecting the wavelength region described above, it is possible to provide a bright and brilliant colors display with the liquid crystal device according to the present invention, since the light with the above wavelength region is recognized as specific colors by human's eyes.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal device according to the present invention has a high reliability since the device is able to make use of conventional TN modes and STN modes, being also advantageous in that the production technology of these TN mode and STN mode liquid crystals have been already established.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The first predetermined polarization components and the second predetermined polarization components as mentioned herein may be either different or the same.</p>
    <p num="11">The liquid crystal device according to the present invention comprises a light source on the opposite side to the liquid crystal panel relative to the reflective polarizer.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In such construction, while the light source is turned on, in other words, while the transmissive display is performed, bright images are displayed when the light emitted from the light source transmits the first polarizer, and dark images are displayed when the light emitted from the light source is absorbed by the first polarizer.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, during the light source is turned off, in other words, the reflective display is performed, colored images are displayed in case that light at limited wavelength range which is included in ambient light entering liquid crystal display is reflected by reflective polarizer, then transmit the first polarizer, and same color images as the background color of the reflective polarizer are displayed in case that ambient light entering liquid crystal display transmits the reflective polarizer.
    </p>
    <p num="13">This means that a transflective liquid crystal device that is able to switch from the reflective display to the transmissive display or vice versa in accordance with turning on or off of the light source can be realized.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In providing the light source as hitherto described, it is required that the light source has dark surface when the light source is turned off.
      <br/>
      Such light source is obtainable by placing a translucent film or a black film perforated with fine holes over the light guide, or by placing a black film under the transparent light guide.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Though the light source as used herein denotes is, in a narrow sense, a luminous body such as a cold cathode ray tube or a LED, it corresponds to the entire back-light provided with a light guide, etc. in a wide sense.
      <br/>
      Any of the light sources described above are available in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="16">It is preferable that a second polarizer is provided between the reflective polarizer and the light source when a light source is provided on the opposite side to the liquid crystal panel relative to the reflective polarizer.</p>
    <p num="17">In the liquid crystal device including the foregoing reflective polarizer between the light source and liquid crystal panel, light at wave length region outside of the wavelength region which reflective polarizer reflects can transmit the reflective polarizer even polarization components of the light is equal to the reflective axis of the reflective polarizer.</p>
    <p num="18">
      Therefore, the dark images displayed in the transmissive display turns into colors at wave length region outside of the wavelength region which reflective polarizer reflects, in other words, becomes the complementary colors of the wavelength region which the reflective polarizer reflects.
      <br/>
      As the result, the contrast of the transmissive display deteriorates so lower that it is unsuitable for making use of depending on the use.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      When a second polarizer is provided between the reflective polarizer and light source as described in the present invention, light having the same polarization components as the reflection axis of the reflective polarizer in which the light is included in the emitted light of the light source can be absorbed by the second polarizer.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the dark color images displayed in the transmissive display can be prevented from being the complementary color in the reflection wavelength region of the reflective polarizer.
    </p>
    <p num="20">It is preferable that the absorption axis of the second polarizer is approximately aligned with the reflection axis of the reflective polarizer when the second polarizer is provided between the reflective polarizer and light source.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Aligning the absorption axis of the second polarizer with the reflection axis of the reflective polarizer enable to more efficiently absorb the light having the same polarization direction as the reflection axis of the reflective polarizer which emitted from the light source by the second polarizer.
      <br/>
      Further, aligning the absorption axis of the second polarizer with the reflection axis of the reflective polarizer necessarily make the polarization axis of the second polarizer align with the polarization axis of the reflective polarizer, consequently the transmittance with a maximum efficiency of the light along the polarization axis direction of the reflective polarizer which is emitted from the light source is realized, thereby the images in the transmissive display become bright.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The liquid crystal device according to the present invention comprises a film that absorbs the light having an wavelength outside of the wavelength range of the reflective polarizer between the reflective polarizer and the light source.</p>
    <p num="23">
      Providing with a film that absorbs the light having an wavelength outside of the wavelength range of the reflective polarizer between the reflective polarizer and the light source as described in the present invention allows the light with an wavelength outside of the reflection wavelength range of the reflective polarizer out of the light emitted from the light source to be absorbed, and consequently, the dark images displayed in the transmissive display can be prevented from being the complementary color in the reflection wavelength region of the reflective polarizer.
      <br/>
      As the result, the contrast in the transmissive display is improved.
      <br/>
      Besides, when the film described above is constructed so that a constant amount of light is absorbed in the entire wavelength region of the visible light, the dark display images in the reflective display becomes darker to improve the contrast.
    </p>
    <p num="24">It is preferable that the wavelength of the light emitted from the light source is within wavelength range capable of being reflected by said reflective polarizer.</p>
    <p num="25">
      When wavelength of light emitted from the light source is within wavelength range capable of being reflected by the reflective polarizer, the light emitted from the light source does not contain any light with an wavelength outside of the wavelength region which reflective polarizer reflects.
      <br/>
      This means that, since there is no light that reaches to the liquid crystal panel after transmitting the reflection axis of reflective polarizer, the light emitted from the light source and enters to the liquid crystal panel consists of only predetermined orientation.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the dark display becomes darker to improve the contrast in the transmissive display because the polarization components of the light emitted from the light source and transmits the liquid crystal panel, can be aligned along one direction to allow the light to be absorbed by the first polarizer.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The forgoing reflective polarizer is characterized by containing a film comprising a layer with an anisotropic refraction index and a layer without any anisotropic refraction index alternately laminated with each other.
      <br/>
      It is advantage to laminate the plurality of films which reflection axis are aligned each other, and each film reflect light having different wavelength ranges.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      By using the reflective polarizer comprising of the films laminated with each other, the liquid crystal devices having different display colors can be easily produced only by changing the combination of these films.
      <br/>
      Further, the above mentioned reflective polarizer also enable to produce a liquid crystal device having a plurality of display color regions with different display colors, so that the variations of the products using the liquid crystal device is expanded.
      <br/>
      An electronic device including a liquid crystal device as a display part, wherein said liquid crystal device comprising:
    </p>
    <p num="28">a liquid crystal panel comprising a pair of substrates between which a liquid crystal is inserted; a first polarizer provided at one side of said liquid crystal panel, not transmitting light having first predetermined polarization components and transmitting light having polarization components being different than said first predetermined polarization components; and a reflective polarizer provided on the opposite side to said first polarizer relative to said liquid crystal panel, reflecting light having second predetermined polarization components at a limited wavelength range within visible light, and transmitting light having polarization components being different than said second predetermined polarization components, and transmitting light having said second predetermined polarization components at wavelength range outside of said limited wavelength within said visible light.</p>
    <p num="29">According to the above mentioned structure, an electronic appliance capable of displaying bright and brilliant color images either under the direct sunlight or in the dark, being fashionable and consuming low electricity can be realized.</p>

      In FIG. 1, 101 is a polarizer, 102 is a retardation film, 103 is a upper glass substrate, 104 is a transparent electrode, 105 is liquid crystal layer, 107 is a bottom side glass substrate, 108 is a light scattering plate, 109 is a reflective polarizer and 110 is a light absorption layer.
      <br/>
      The polarizer 101 and the retardation film 102, the retardation film 102 and the upper glass substrate 103, the bottom side glass substrate 107 and the light scattering plate 108, the light scattering plate 108 and the reflective polarizer 109, and the reflective polarizer 109 and the light absorption layer 110 are bonded with each other respectively with a paste.
      <br/>
      Although the space between the upper and bottom side transparent electrodes 104 is drawn widely apart for clear recognition of the drawing, they are actually confronted with each other with a narrow gap of several  MU m to several tens  MU m. Though the elements such as liquid crystal orientation films, insulation films, anti-glare films, spacer balls, driver IC's and driving circuits are essential other than the construction elements shown in the drawing, they are omitted since they are not especially needed to explain the present invention.

      The polarizer 101 has a function to absorb a predetermined given linear polarized light component and transmit the remaining polarized light components.
      <br/>
      This is a most commonly used type of the polarizer produced by allowing halogens such as iodine or dichromic dyes to absorb on a polymer film.

    <p num="34">
      The retardation film 102 is a uniaxial oriented film made of, for example, polycarbonate that is utilized for compensating coloring of the display of the STN type liquid crystal device.
      <br/>
      This film is often omitted in the TN type liquid crystal device.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The liquid crystal layers 105 are composed of a STN nematic liquid crystal composition twisted by an angle of 180 (degree)  to 270 (degree) . A TN liquid crystal composition with a twist angle of 90 (degree)  may be used when the display capacity is small.
      <br/>
      The twist angle is determined by the direction of the orientation treatment on the surface of the upper and bottom side glass substrates and the quantity of a chiral agent to be added in the liquid crystal.

    <p num="36">
      A embossed plastic plate or a beads dispersed plastic plate maybe used for the light scattering plate 108.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to adhere the bottom side glass substrate 107 to the reflective polarizer 109 directly and mix beads into the adhesion layer to use the adhesion layer containing beads instead of the light scattering plate.
      <br/>
      The light scattering plate 108 is disposed for the purpose of adequately dispersing the reflected light from the reflective polarizer having a nearly specular reflection.
      <br/>
      However, it is possible to perform display without the light scattering plate 108.
      <br/>
      The position of the light scattering plate 108 may come in contact with 105, may be between 102 and 103 or may be on the top face of 101, besides the position between the bottom side glass substrate 107 and the reflective polarizer 109.

      The light absorption layer 110 is prepared by adhering black vinyl sheets or black paper, or by giving a black paint directly on the layer.

      A birefringent dielectric multi-layer film was used for the reflective polarizer 109.

      This birefringent dielectric multi-layer film has a function to reflect light having predetermined linear polarized light component and to transmit the remaining polarized light component.
      <br/>
      Such reflective polarizers are disclosed in the published international patent applications (international application numbers WO 95/17303, WO 95/17691, WO 95/17692, WO 95/17699, WO 95/27919, WO 96/19347, WO 97/01439, WO 97/01440, WO 97/01610, WO 97/01726, WO 97/01774, WO 97/01778, WO 97/01780, WO 97/01781, WO 97/01788, WO 97/01789 and WO 97/07653).

      The construction and function of the reflective polarizer will be described referring to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a drawing showing the birefringent dielectric multi-layer film comprising two kinds of polymer layers 201 and 202 alternately laminated with each other.
      <br/>
      One of the two kinds of polymers is selected from a material having a large photoelastic coefficient and the other material is selected form a material having a low photoelastic coefficient, with paying attention so that the refractive index of ordinary rays of the both films becomes nearly equal.
      <br/>
      For example, PEN (2,6-polyethylene naphthalate) and coPEN (70-naphthalate/30-terephthalate copolyester) can be selected as a material with a large photoelastic coefficient and a material with a small photoelastic coefficient, respectively.
      <br/>
      When both kind of films are alternately laminated and appropriately oriented along the x-axis direction of the rectangular coordinate system 203 in FIG. 2, the refractive index along the x-axis direction were 1.88, in the PEN layer and 1.64, in the coPEN layer, respectively.
      <br/>
      The refractive index along the y-axis direction was about 1.64 either in the PEN layer or in the coPEN layer.
      <br/>
      When a light is entered into this laminated films from the normal line direction, the light component vibrating along the y-axis direction transmits the film as it is, which is termed as a polarization axis.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the light component vibrating along the x-axis direction is reflected, only in the case when the PEN layer and coPEN layer satisfy a predetermined condition, which is termed as a reflection axis.
      <br/>
      The predetermined conditions mean that the sum total of the optical path length of the PEN layer (the product of the refractive index and film thickness) and the same of the coPEN layer (the product of the refractive index and film thickness) is equal to one half of the light wavelength.
      <br/>
      When such PEN layers and coPEN layers are laminated by several tens layers for each, or several hundreds layers for each if possible, almost all the light components vibrating along the x-axis direction can be reflected.
      <br/>
      It is needless to say that, since this condition is only valid for the light having a narrow wavelength range, a light-polarizing ability can be generated only in the light of limited colors.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The reflective polarizer having a polarization ability in a broader wavelength region is constructed as shown in FIG. 3.

      Films 301, 302 and 303, each of which comprising PEN layer and coPEN layer laminated each other, correspond to the birefringent dielectric multi-layer films in FIG. 2, respectively.
      <br/>
      The optical path length of each layer is adjusted so as to reflect the predetermined linearly polarized light of blue light, green light or red light, respectively.
      <br/>
      The film thickness of each layer is about 25  MU m. The dielectric multi-layer films 301, 302 and 303 are laminated so that their polarization axes (reflection axes and transmittance axes) are in a parallel relation with each other.

      FIG. 4 is a graph showing the polarization characteristics of the foregoing blue polarized light reflection film 301, green polarized light reflection film 302 and red polarized light reflection film 303.

      <br/>
      While 411, 412 and 413 correspond to the reflection spectra in the same direction of the polarization axis direction of the dielectric multi-layer films 301, 302 and 303, respectively.
      <br/>
      The reflection wavelength regions of each 401, 402 and 403 are overlapped with each other.
      <br/>
      When such dielectric multi-layer films 301, 302 and 303 are laminated with their polarization axes aligned, a polarization ability throughout the entire wavelength region of the visible light can be generated.
      <br/>
      When one or two layers of them are laminated, the polarization ability is generated for a specific color only.
      <br/>
      According to the construction as described above, the reflective polarizer for each six colors of blue, green, red, yellow cyanogen and Magenta can be obtained.

      The reflective polarizer in FIG. 5 comprises only the green color polarized light reflection film having a function to reflect the linearly polarized light in the wavelength range of 500 to 590 nm (green light range) but not to reflect (namely, to transmit) the light outside of this range.

      The function of the reflective liquid crystal device according to the first embodiment will be described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      A green polarized light reflection film shown in FIG. 5 is used in the following descriptions.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, the retardation and the twist angle of the liquid crystal layers 105, the retardation and the direction of the optical axis of retardation film 102, and the direction of the polarized light axis both of the absorption type polarizer 101 and reflective polarizer 109 are adjusted so that the luminous display is performed when the liquid crystal device is in a non-selective state while the dark display is performed when the liquid crystal device is in a selective state.
      <br/>
      Such selection allows a green display is performed in the non-selective state in accordance with the reflection characteristics of the reflective polarizer, while a black display is performed in the selective state since all the light is absorbed by the light absorption layer 110 after transmitting the reflective polarizer.
      <br/>
      Thereby a black display on a green background is realized.
      <br/>
      This green display is very bright and clear besides having high visibility because the reflective polarizer has a high refraction index and the wavelength selectivity is superior.
      <br/>
      Further, since reflection itself from the reflective polarizer 109 is a specular reflection, a glitter and lustrous display can be performed by adjusting the scattering characteristics of the light scattering plate 108.
      <br/>
      Besides, on the contrary, when the liquid crystal device is adjusted so as to perform dark display in the non-selective state and to perform luminous display in the selective state, a green display on a black background is realized.

      Any colors other than the colors hitherto described can be displayed by changing the reflection wavelength range of the reflective polarizer and the colors of the light absorption layer in various manners.

      The green polarized light reflection film having the characteristics shown by 905 in FIG. 5 was used in the subsequent descriptions.
      <br/>
      In the figures, "A" denotes the green light, "B" denotes Magenta light that is a complementary color of "A" and "Total" (ZEN) denotes a sum total of "A" and "B", namely white light.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Firstly, the case when the light source 906 is not luminous, namely the case of the reflective display is described below.
      <br/>
      The external lights of 911 and 912 entered from the upper side are converted into a linearly polarized light by the polarizer 901.
      <br/>
      After then, though the light experiences various modulation through the retardation film and liquid crystal panel, the light is approximately reverted to the linearly polarized light when the light enters into the reflective polarizer 905.
      <br/>
      However, the light after passing through the non-selective region and the light after passing through the selective region of the liquid crystal are orthogonal with each other.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the reflective polarizer is previously arranged so as to reflect the light after passing through the non-selective region and to transmit the light after passing through the selective region.
      <br/>
      In the non-selective region, the green color component out of the linearly polarized light entering into the polarizer is reflected while the Magenta color component, which is a complementary color of said green color component is transmitted.
      <br/>
      The reflected green color component is projected out upward through the same light path as described above, on the other hand, the transmitted Magenta color component is absorbed by the light source or by the light absorber placed at the front or rear of light source.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the non-selective region corresponds to the bright green display.
      <br/>
      While, the selective region corresponds to the dark display since all the linearly polarized light entering into the reflective polarizer is transmitted and then absorbed by the light source or by the absorber placed at the front of rear of light source.

    <p num="55">
      The case when the light source 906 is luminous, in other words the case of the transmissive display, will be discussed hereinafter.

      <br/>
      Therefore, the external lights 911 and 912 are neglected herein.
      <br/>
      The green color component out of the one linearly polarized light of the lights 913 and 914 emitted from the light source 906 is reflected by the reflective polarizer 905 while the remaining Magenta color component and the other linearly polarized light are transmitted.
      <br/>
      This light component is modulated by the liquid crystal panel and the retardation film, and only the Magenta light component transmits in the non-selective region owing to the polarizer 901, thereby a relative dark Magenta color display is obtained.
      <br/>
      On the other hands, a bright white display can be obtained in the selective region by allowing the white light to transmit.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      As hitherto described, a black display on the green background in the reflective display and a white display on the Magenta color background in the transmissive display can be respectively obtained in the liquid crystal device according to the second embodiment.

    <p num="63">
      The case when the light source 1107 is luminous, in other words, the case of the transmissive display, will be discussed hereinafter.

      FIG. 12 is the drawing showing the major part of the structure of the liquid crystal device according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The construction will be described at first.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 12, 1201 is a polarizer, 1202 is a retardation film, 1203 is a upper glass substrate, 1204 is a transparent electrode, 1205 is liquid crystal layer, 1206 is a seal, 1207 is a bottom side glass substrate, 1208 is a light scattering plate, 1209 is a reflective polarizer, 1210 is a color film, 1211 is a light guide plate and 1212 is a light source.
      <br/>
      The polarizer 1201 and the retardation film 1202, the retardation film 1202 and the upper glass substrate 1203, the bottom side glass substrate 1207 and the light scattering plate 1208, the light scattering plate 1208 and the reflective polarizer 1209, and the reflective polarizer 1209 the color film 1210 are respectively adhered with each other with a paste.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Each construction element will be then described in orders.
      <br/>
      The same construction elements as those used in the second embodiment were also utilized in this embodiment as the polarizer 1201, the retardation film 1202, the liquid crystal layer 1205, the light scattering plate 1208, the reflective polarizer 1209, the light guide plate 1211 and the light source 1212.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The color film 1210 mainly has characteristics to absorb predetermined light in the entire wavelength region of the visible light along with absorbing the light outside of the reflection wavelength region of the reflective polarizer 1209.
      <br/>
      For example, when the green polarized light reflection film shown in FIG. 5 was utilized for a reflective polarizer, a deep green color film having a transmittance characteristics to absorb mainly the light in the Magenta color wavelength region as shown in FIG. 14 can be used.
      <br/>
      Since this film also has a absorption band in the green wavelength region, it can be used instead of the half light-absorption film 810 in FIG. 8 in the second embodiment or the half light-absorption film 1011 in FIG. 10 in the third embodiment, exhibiting an effect to enhance the contrast in the reflective display.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      The principle of display of the liquid crystal device according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 13, 1301 is a polarizer, 1302 is a retardation film, 1303 is a upper glass substrate, 1304 is a bottom side glass substrate, 1305 is a reflective polarizer, 1306 is a color film, 1307 is a light source, 1308 is a liquid crystal in the non-selective region, and 1309 is a liquid crystal in the selective region.
      <br/>
      The green polarized light reflection film having the characteristics as shown in FIG. 5 is utilized as 1305, the deep green color film having the characteristics as shown in FIG. 14 is utilized as 1306 and a white light source were utilized as 1307, respectively, in the following description.
      <br/>
      In the drawing, "A" denotes the green color light, "B" denotes Magenta color light that is a complementary color of "A" and "Total" ("ZEN")denotes a sum total of "A" and "B", namely a white color light.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Nextly, the case when the light source 1307 is not luminous, in other words, the case of the reflective display is described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      The external lights 1311 and 1312 entered from the upper side are converted into a linearly polarized light by the polarizer 1301.
      <br/>
      After then, though the light experiences various modulation through the retardation film and liquid crystal panel, the light is reverted to the approximate linearly polarized light when the light is enters the reflective polarizer 1305.
      <br/>
      However, the light after passing through the non-selective region and the light after passing through the selective region of the liquid crystal panel are orthogonal with each other.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the reflective polarizer 1305 is previously arranged so as to reflect the light after passing through the non-selective region and to transmit the light after passing through the selective region.
      <br/>
      In the non-selective region, the green color component out of the linearly polarized light entering into the reflective polarizer 1305 is reflected while the Magenta color component, which is a complementary color of said green color component is transmitted.
      <br/>
      The reflected green color component is projected out upward through the same light path as described above, on the other hand, the transmitted Magenta color component is absorbed by the color film 1306.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the non-selective region corresponds to the bright green color display.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, the selective region corresponds to the dark display since all the linearly polarized light entering into the reflective polarizer 1305 is transmitted and then absorbed by the color film 1306 or in front or rear of the light source.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The case when the light source 1307 is luminous, in other words, the case of the transmissive display, will be discussed hereinafter.
      <br/>
      In the circumstances where the transmissive display is used in the transflective liquid crystal device, the environment is supposed to be sufficiently dark.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the external lights 1311 and 1312 are neglected herein.
      <br/>
      Only the green color component out of the lights 1313 and 1314 projected from the light source 1307 transmits the color film 1306, which is then converted into linearly polarized lights by the reflective polarizer 1305.
      <br/>
      This light is modulated by the liquid crystal panel and retardation film and shows a dark display in the non-selective region and a luminous display in the selective region by means of the polarizer 1301.
