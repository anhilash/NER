      Field of Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a signlight system, and more particularly to an auxiliary auto signlight system that provides an innovative auxiliary lighting in an automotive in order to highly increase the liability of driving.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Arts</p>
    <p num="4">
      Thousands of accidents occur everyday because of the drivers' careless.
      <br/>
      Accidents usually occur when drivers want to cut lane on the road or back up in the parking lot without a significant signal so that collisions may happen between vehicles.
      <br/>
      Moreover, when the driver is in danger such as being chased or the vehicle suddenly broken down on the freeway, an emergency light on the vehicle should be significantly switched on to awake people in the surroundings.
      <br/>
      So, a panel of signlight such as turn, brake, and hazard warning signlight is important to a vehicle for attracting people's attention by the designated signals.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Referring to FIG. 1 of the drawing, a conventional auto signlight system is illustrated.
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIG. 2 of the drawing, an auxiliary auto signlight system 1 according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated.
      <br/>
      The auxiliary auto signlight system 1 is installed at an upper portion of an interior rear windshield 6 in such a manner that the auxiliary auto signlight system 1 will not block the rear view from the driver while driving.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the auxiliary auto signlight system 1 is adapted for equipping with the conventional signlight system of an existing vehicle without any alteration.
      <br/>
      So, for example, both right turn signal lights on the auxiliary auto signlight system 1 and the conventional signlight system will switch on or off at the same time.
    </p>
    <p num="17">The auxiliary auto signlight system 1 for a vehicle comprises a strobe module 10 mounted on the upper portion of the interior of rear windshield 6, a plurality of strobes 20 each having a replaceable lighting element base 21 serially mounted on the strobe module 10, a plurality of lighting elements 30 such as light bulb or LED replaceably mounted on the lighting element bases 21 inside the strobes 20 respectively, and a connecting means 40 for electrically connected between the strobe 20 of the strobe module 10 and a power outlet of the vehicle for conducting electricity.</p>
    <p num="18">
      At least nine strobes 20 are mounted on the strobe module 10, arranging from two outermost ends are a pair of turn signal lights 11, two interior ends next to the turn signal lights are a pair of taillights 12, two interior ends next to the taillights are a pair of brake signal lights 13, and two interior ends next to the brake signal lights are a pair of back-up signal lights 14 respectively and a center strobe having a SOS logo printed thereon represents an emergency light 15.
      <br/>
      The emergency light 15 has a size bigger than other strobes is adapted for strongly signifying the emergency signal.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Furthermore, the conventional signlight system installed in the vehicle has different illuminated colors to indicate different signal such as turn signal light having a flashing yellow illuminator.
      <br/>
      The auxiliary auto signlight system 1 has the same configuration of the conventional signlight system, wherein a flashing yellow illuminator for the turn signal light 11 is indicated when the turn signal switch is turned on, a white illuminator is indicated for the taillight 12, a red illuminator for the brake signal light 13 will be brightened when the driver hit the brake paddle, a white illuminator for the backup signal light 14 will be brightened when the vehicle is in reverse gear, and a purple illuminator is flashing when the emergency signal light 15 is switched on.
      <br/>
      It is worth to mention that the emergency signal light 15 having a SOS logo will be flashed when the switch is on and the SOS signal will significantly notice people in the surrounding that the driver is in emergency.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the auxiliary auto signlight system 1 further comprises the signal device 50 mounted inside a side mirror housing 60 wherein the signal device 50 has at least a colored lighting element 30 detachably mounted thereon and connected to the connecting means 40 which comprises electrical wires.
      <br/>
      A transparent cap 55 having a ring shaped is mounted at a back portion of the side mirror housing 60 to provide a peripheral light passage to encircle the, as shown in FIG. 3 side mirror 61.
      <br/>
      So, when the lighting element 30 inside the signal device 50 is flashing or brightened, the lighting element light will pass around the side mirror 61 and through the transparent cap 55 to outside and give a signal to other vehicle at the side which is unable to catch the signal at the rear portion of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Also, the signal device 50 may have more lighting elements 30 to illuminate different colors such as yellow and red for indicating different signals such as turn and brake corresponding to the configuration of the strobe 20 light of the auxiliary auto signlight system 1.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring to FIG. 3 of the drawing, a supplementary emergency light 70 having a "SOS" logo mounted on each of an upper and front portion of the side mirror housing 60, wherein the supplementary emergency light 70 is adapted for noticing the emergency signal to the people at the front and side view of the vehicle while the "SOS" emergency light 15 is adapted for noticing the emergency signal to the people at the back and side view of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      So, people at every view of the vehicle are able to notice the emergency signal.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Furthermore, a plurality of switches 151, as shown in FIG. 4, for turning on both the "SOS" emergency light 15 and the supplementary emergency light 70 are installed at designated places inside the vehicle such as the dashboard or armrest for easy reaching so that the driver and passengers are able to turn on the "SOS" emergency light 15 and the supplementary emergency light 70 immediately when necessary.

      <br/>
      In order to turn off the emergency lights, the hood in the front of the vehicle must be open first and then turn on and off the switch 152 under the hood.
      <br/>
      In other words, people cannot turn off the emergency lights inside the vehicle.
      <br/>
      So, the driver and the passengers will not be threatened to turn off the emergency which may save their lives.
    </p>
    <p num="23">A parallel power cord 80 is extended from the wire 40 in order to supple electricity for further usage of the electrical products such as a small refrigerator or a mini-television adapted for installing in the vehicle by easily plugging in to the parallel power cord 80.</p>
