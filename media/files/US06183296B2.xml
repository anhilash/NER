      The electrical connector may include a housing, a contact, a secondary lock, a grommet, a backplate, a bolt, a contact removal tool, and a splash guard.
      <br/>
      The housing includes openings which receive the contacts.
      <br/>
      The grommets are positioned in cavities at the rear of the housing.
      <br/>
      The housing and backplate are designed so that the grommets are subjected to compressive forces in order to enhance the sealing characteristic of the grommets.
      <br/>
      As the contact is inserted, a locking tab engages an opening in the contact and prevents the contact from being removed from the housing.
      <br/>
      The secondary locks will increase the retention of the contact in the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      In addition, the secondary lock may include a feature which permits the partial insertion and retention of the secondary lock prior to insertion of the contact.
      <br/>
      The secondary lock also assures that the contacts have been properly inserted.
      <br/>
      The electrical connector may also include a splash guard which would assist in deflecting water from the rear of the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      The electrical connector may also include a removal tool which may be used to remove contacts from the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      The removal tool can be stored in the backplate or the housing.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to an electrical connector and more particularly to an electrical connector which can be used in exterior environmental conditions.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Electrical connectors are used in exterior environments to connect wires with various devices.
      <br/>
      The exterior environments may include agricultural equipment, construction equipment or other vehicles which may be exposed to the weather, such as, moisture and temperature extremes.
      <br/>
      In addition, such electrical connectors are subjected to vibration from the engine or the movement of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Thus, the electrical connector should withstand these operating conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In addition, it is necessary to attach the electrical connector to the individual wires.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the individual wire is attached to an electrical contact.
      <br/>
      The electrical contact with the attached wire is then assembled into the housing for the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      This process may be performed by an individual and therefore, can be relatively expensive.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      A general object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector which can withstand environmental conditions for the particular application.
      <br/>
      Another object of the invention is to provide an electrical connector which reduces the manufacturing and assembly costs.
      <br/>
      An additional object of the invention is to provide an electrical connector which minimizes the number of components for the electrical connector.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another object of the invention is to provide alignment features for each of the components so that the components can be assembled in only one specific orientation.
      <br/>
      A further object of the invention is to provide higher contact retention so that the contact cannot be unintentionally removed from the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      Another object of the invention is to provide a secondary lock which confirms that the contact is properly positioned and also improves the retention of the contact in the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      Another object of the invention is to provide a secondary lock with a first position which retains the secondary lock in a partially inserted position and a second position which locks the contact into the insulator after the contact has been inserted.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A further object of the invention is to reduce the amount of insulator material used in the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      An additional object of the invention is to provide a contact removal tool which is included in the electrical connector and can be used by a repair person in a remote location.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Also, an object of the invention is to provide a backplate which prevents the grommet from being disassembled when a wire and contact are removed from the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      An additional object is to provide a backplate which assists the grommet in maintaining an environmentally resistant seal.
      <br/>
      Another object of the invention is to provide a backplate which orients the contact for proper insertion.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      An additional object is to provide an electrical connector with "push to seat" contacts versus "pull to seat" contacts.
      <br/>
      A further object is to provide an electrical connector which includes a water shield.
      <br/>
      A further object is to provide an electrical connector which is available in different sizes depending upon the number of contacts which are required.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon reading the following description and upon reference to the drawings.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      The electrical connector may include a housing, a contact, a secondary lock, a grommet, a backplate, a bolt, a contact removal tool, and a splash guard.
      <br/>
      The housing includes openings which receive the contacts.
      <br/>
      The contact is crimped onto the wire to create the contact and wire assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The grommets are positioned in cavities at the rear of the housing.
      <br/>
      The grommets form a relatively weather resistant seal.
      <br/>
      The electrical connector may also include the backplate.
      <br/>
      The housing and backplate are designed so that the grommets are subjected to compressive forces in order to enhance the sealing characteristic of the grommets.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As the contact is inserted, a locking tab is deflected upward when the contact engages the ramp.
      <br/>
      The ramp engages an opening in the contact and prevents the contact from being removed from the housing.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Although the locking tab will prevent the contact from being removed, the secondary locks will increase the retention of the contact in the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      In addition, the secondary lock may include a feature which permits the partial insertion of the secondary lock prior to insertion of the contact and wire assembly.
      <br/>
      The secondary lock also assures that the contacts have been properly inserted.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The electrical connector may also include a splash guard which would assist in deflecting water from the rear of the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      The electrical connector may also include a removal tool which may be used to remove contacts from the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      The removal tool can be stored in the backplate.

    <p num="20">
      The grommets 40, 42 are positioned in cavities at the rear of the housing 32.
      <br/>
      The grommets 40, 42 include apertures 62 which correspond with the openings 52 in the housing.
      <br/>
      The apertures 62 are chamfered on each side of the grommet.
      <br/>
      The grommets 40, 42 may also include ribs 64 which will engage the housing 32 to form a relatively weather resistant seal.
      <br/>
      The grommets 40, 42 include a recess 66 which engages a mating post 67 (FIGS. 4-5) on the housing 32.
      <br/>
      The recess 66 and post 67 assure the proper orientation of the grommet with the housing.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The electrical connector may also include the backplate 44.
      <br/>
      The backplate 44 includes openings 68 which correspond with the array or configuration of the aperture 62 and openings 52.
      <br/>
      The backplate 44 also includes aperture 70 to receive bolt 46.
      <br/>
      The flanges 72, 73 and openings 74 are used to attach the backplate to the housing.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 2, 4A and 9, the housing includes protrusions 76, 77 which engage the flanges 72, 73 and openings 74 to hold the backplate in position.
      <br/>
      The housing 32 and backplate 44 are designed so that the grommets 40, 42 are subjected to compressive forces in order to enhance the sealing characteristics of the grommets.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The spacing between the upper protrusions 76 is slightly less than the spacing between the lower protrusions 77.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the spacing between the upper flanges 72 is slightly less than the spacing between the lower flanges 73.
      <br/>
      The spacing of the lower flanges 73 corresponds to the spacing of the lower protrusions 77 and the spacing of the upper flanges 72 corresponds to the spacing of the upper protrusions 76.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the backplate 44 can be assembled to the housing 32 in only one specific orientation.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      After the grommets 40, 42 and backplate 44 have been assembled to the housing 32, the contact and wire assemblies 61 can be inserted into the appropriate opening 68 in the backplate.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 2, 4A and 12, the opening 68 includes grooves 78 similar to grooves 54 in the housing.
      <br/>
      The protrusions 56 on the contact engage the grooves 78 to maintain the proper alignment of the contact 34.
      <br/>
      The grooves 78 are configured so that the contact 34 can be inserted in only one specific orientation.
      <br/>
      The contact 34 is then pushed through the corresponding aperture 62 in the grommet.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, the contact is then inserted into the corresponding opening 52 in the housing.
      <br/>
      As noted above, the openings 52 include grooves 54 on two opposite sides of the rectangular openings 52.
      <br/>
      The protrusions 56 on the contact engage the grooves 54 to assure proper alignment of the contact and to support the contact in the housing.
      <br/>
      The grooves 54 are configured so that the contact 34 can only be inserted in one specific orientation.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      As the contact 34 is inserted to the left in FIGS. 4A and 6, the locking tab 80 is deflected upward when the contact engages the ramp 82.
      <br/>
      As the contact moves to the left in FIG. 6, the ramp 82 engages the opening 58 in the contact 34.
      <br/>
      The opening 58 and the locking tab 80 which includes ramp 82 prevents the contact from being removed from the housing by limiting the movement of the contact to the right in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      In addition, the housing includes a stop 84 which limits the movement of the contact 34 to the left as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The process is then repeated for each contact and wire assembly 61.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      As shown in FIG. 12, the backplate 44 includes indicia 86 to identify the columns and rows.
      <br/>
      The indicia may include letters and numbers.
      <br/>
      This indicia may assist in the proper placement of contacts during assembly or during repair.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, corresponding indicia 88 may be located on housing 32 to facilitate assembly or repair.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Although the locking tab 80 will prevent the contact from being removed, certain uses of the electrical connector may require the use of secondary locks 36, 38.
      <br/>
      The secondary locks will increase the retention of the contact in the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      In addition, the secondary lock may include a feature which permits the partial insertion of the secondary lock prior to insertion of the contact and wire assembly.
      <br/>
      This preload feature permits partial assembly prior to shipment and permits successive assembly operations.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As shown in FIG. 4A, the secondary lock 36 is partially inserted into the housing.
      <br/>
      The secondary lock includes protrusions 96 and the housing 32 includes detents which will engage the protrusions 96.
      <br/>
      The detents and the protrusions hold the secondary lock in the preload position which is shown in FIG. 4A. The secondary lock will remain in this position until a sufficient force is applied to the left or right in FIG. 4A to remove or fully insert the secondary lock.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      After the contact and wire assemblies 61 have been fully inserted into the appropriate positions in the housing, the secondary locks 36, 38 can be fully inserted as shown in FIGS. 4 and 6.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 6 and 13, the secondary lock includes three shelves 98.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 6, the shelves 98 are adjacent to the locking tabs 80 when the secondary lock is fully inserted.
      <br/>
      The shelves 98 prevent the locking tabs 80 from deflecting upward and releasing contact 34.
      <br/>
      Thus, the secondary lock provides additional retention of the contact 34 in the electrical connector.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The secondary lock 36, 38 also assures that the contacts 34 have been properly inserted.
      <br/>
      If a contact has not been fully inserted, then the locking tab 80 will be deflected upward which will prevent the full insertion of the secondary lock.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the secondary lock cannot be fully inserted, the contacts can be checked to determine proper insertion.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The secondary locks also have a feature to lock the secondary locks into the housing.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 2, the secondary locks 36, 38 includes locking tabs 100 with protrusions 102.
      <br/>
      The locking tabs 100 engage detents in the housing 32.
      <br/>
      The locking tabs 100 and detents hold the secondary lock in the fully inserted position as shown in FIGS. 4 and 6.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the secondary locks 36, 38 also include apertures 104 which correspond with the apertures and openings in the housing, grommets and backplate.
      <br/>
      Finally, referring to FIG. 6, the shelves 98 also provide additional insulation between the rows of contacts to prevent contacts from touching each other.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Referring to FIG. 4A, it can now be appreciated that the secondary locks 36, 38 when in the preload position will not interfere with the insertion of the contacts 34.
      <br/>
      Specifically, as the contact 34 is inserted into the aperture 52 the locking tab 80 will be able to deflect without interference from the shelves 98.
      <br/>
      However, depending upon the desired assembly process, the secondary locks would not be inserted into the housing 32 until the contact and wire assembly 61 had been inserted into the connector.
      <br/>
      In addition, the preload feature could be eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, a mating connector or device 106 is mated to the electrical connector.
      <br/>
      The connector or device 106 includes contacts 108 which engage the corresponding contacts 34.
      <br/>
      The contacts 34 include a first cantilever portion 110 and a second cantilever portion 112.
      <br/>
      Prior to insertion of the mating contact 108 the first and second cantilever portions 110, 112 are angled upward.
      <br/>
      Upon insertion of the mating contact 108, the first and second cantilever portions are deflected downward as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Due to the characteristics of the metal, the cantilever portions continue to exert an upward force upon mating contact 108 in order to assure continuous electrical connection.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, as the mating contact 108 is inserted into the contact 34, the first cantilever portion 110 performs a wiping action which removes debris and oxidation from the contact 34 and mating contact 108 to assure a good electrical connection.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      After the contact and wire assemblies 61 are inserted and the secondary locks 36, 38 have been inserted, the bolt 46 may be inserted into the electrical connector.
      <br/>
