      Suction skimming device includes a skimming sleeve elongated body member having a fluid flow passageway disposed proximally contiguous and slidably movable along the vertical axis of an elongated body sleeve guide member having a fluid flow passageway.
      <br/>
      The fluid flow passageway of the skimming sleeve member is in open communication with the fluid flow passageway of the sleeve guide member.
      <br/>
      The suction skimmer is provided with a flotation assembly to buoyantly support the skimming sleeve member thereby positioning the inlet first end of the skimming sleeve member near the surface of a fluid body.
      <br/>
      The flotation assembly is removably engaged to the skimming sleeve member so that the distance between the skimming sleeve inlet and the surface of a fluid body can be preferentially adjusted and engaged over a large array of vertical distances.

    <heading>BACKGROUND--FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This present invention relates generally to suction skimmer systems and, more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to a self leveling suction skimmer which can be adjustably engaged at preferred distances from the surface of a fluid body to separate preferred upper layers of liquid from a carrying layer of liquid in a fluid composition of immiscible liquids.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Liquid mixtures produced by various industrial or natural processes frequently contain substances of differing specific gravity which separate by specific gravity into layers within the body of liquid.
      <br/>
      Skimming devices can be used to separate liquids of lighter specific gravity such as in oil-water mixtures into two components, one having molecules of substantially lighter specific gravity, while the other contains molecules of a substantially heavier specific gravity.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Suction skimmers have been deployed to remove the topmost layers of fluids from these liquid mixtures.
      <br/>
      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,330 by Gary C. Garrett a suction skimming device is described which requires manual adjustment to change skim positions in response to level changes in the liquid body.
      <br/>
      This device skims from only two preferred directions using fixed slot positions and also can not be configured to substantially exclude the topmost fluid layers from the skimmed fluids.
    </p>
    <p num="4">U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,705 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,213 by James A. Glasgow include a floating suction skimmer but this construction requires a complex mechanical sensor which is subject to mechanical failure and failure of operation due to the presence of grit and contaminants in the skimmed fluids.</p>
    <p num="5">From the foregoing, no previous suction skimmer apparatus is self leveling for variable levels in the fluid body, skims adjustably preferred layers near the surface of a fluid body, provides a highly accurate and simple to operate method for setting and controlling variable preferred skim depths near a fluid surface, or which can operate without failure in the presence of grit and contaminants in the skimmed fluids.</p>
    <heading>OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES</heading>
    <p num="6">Accordingly, several objects and advantages of the present invention are offered:</p>
    <p num="7">
      (a) to provide an object which can skim fluids near the surface of a fluid body which is self leveling in response to level changes in the fluid body.
      <br/>
      (b) to provide an object which can skim fluids near the surface of a fluid body which can be easily adjusted so as to skim at preferred variable distances from the surface of a fluid body.
      <br/>
      (c) to provide an object which can skim fluids near the surface of a fluid body whose skimming inlet can be adjustably disposed and engaged over a large array of preferred distances from the surface of a fluid body.
      <br/>
      (d) to provide an object which can skim fluids at preferred distances from the surface of a fluid body which is simple to operate and maintain.
      <br/>
      (e) to provide an object which can skim fluids near the surface of a fluid body which can operate without the need for sensors or mechanical linkages.
      <br/>
      (f) to provide an object which can skim fluids near the surface of a fluid body which can operate without interruption due to the presence of physical contaminants such as grit in the skimmed fluids.
      <br/>
      (g) to provide an object which can skim fluids near the surface of a fluid body which can be adjusted and operated so as to substantially exclude the topmost layer of a fluid body from entering the flow of skimmed fluids.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The present invention is adapted for separating immiscible liquids such as oil and water.
      <br/>
      It may be used for removing spilled oil from bays, rivers, and lakes, etc. or may also be used in a tank or vessel as shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Shown in FIG. 1 is a fluid processing system 10 for selectively withdrawing a preferred upper layer or portion 12 of a fluid body 14 from a vessel 16 which includes a self leveling suction skimmer 18 constructed and operated in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The vessel 16 is provided with a fluid inlet 20 and a fluid outlet 22.
      <br/>
      The processing system 10 further includes a pump 24 and an effluent separation or purification system 26.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The suction skimmer 18 is disposed within vessel 16 substantially as shown and can be connected directly or by a standard pipe coupling (not shown) to the fluid outlet 22 so that fluid communication is established therebetween.
      <br/>
      The fluid outlet 22 is also connected to the suction port (not shown) of the pump 24 via conduit 28 and the discharge port 30 of the pump 24 is connected to the effluent separation or purification system 26 via conduit 32.
      <br/>
      The effluent separation or purification system 26 is then connected to the fluid inlet 20 of the vessel 16 via conduit 34.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      When the fluid body 14 becomes contaminated with hydrocarbon, non-emulsified oils, soils, and or grit such as metal particles, the pump 24 is actuated so that the upper layer 12 of the fluid body 14 is withdrawn from the vessel 16 under substantially laminar flow conditions via the suction skimmer 18 and passed to the effluent separation or purification system 26 via the fluid outlet 22 of the vessel 16, the conduit 28, the pump 24 and the conduit 32.
      <br/>
      After the contaminants have been removed from the fluid body 14 by the effluent separation or purification system 26, the treated liquid, substantially free of contaminants, is passed to the vessel 16 via the conduit 34 and the fluid inlet 20 of the vessel 16.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The fluid body 14 can be an aqueous solution containing a surfactant such as is used in parts washers, or a lubricant such as is used in a milling or drilling machine.
      <br/>
      Thus the nature and type of effluent separation or purification system employed will be dependent upon the nature of the fluid body 14 in the vessel 16, as well as the contaminants in the liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="15">As will be described in more detail hereinafter, the design and operation of the suction skimmer 18 permits the upper layer 12 of the fluid body 14 contained in the vessel 16 to be removed at adjustably preferred distances from the surface of the fluid body 14 under substantially laminar flow conditions while self leveling in response to changes in the fluid level of vessel 16.</p>
    <p num="16">The suction skimmer 18 includes an elongated body skimming sleeve member 36 having a first end 38, a second end 40, an inside diameter 42 (FIG. 3), an outside diameter 44, a fluid flow passageway 46 extending therebetween, an inner peripheral surface 48 and an outer peripheral surface 50.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The suction skimmer 18 further includes a flotation assembly 52 for buoyantly supporting and removably engaging the skimming sleeve member 36.
      <br/>
      The first end 38 of the skimming sleeve member 36 comprises the suction skimmer inlet.
      <br/>
      The flotation assembly 52 comprises a method for removably engaging and adjusting preferred distances between the first end 38 of the skimming sleeve member 36 and the surface of the upper layer 12 of fluid body 14 in vessel 16.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The flotation assembly 52 is provided with support bracket members 54 in the form of elongated plates which can be attached by welding to the elongated body of the skimming sleeve member 36 in a perpendicular alignment with the skimming sleeve member 36.
      <br/>
      Support bracket members 54 are circumfrencially spaced approximately 90 degrees in apposition on the skimming sleeve member 36.
      <br/>
      The support bracket members 54 are provided with a first side 56 and a second side 58.
      <br/>
      The support bracket members 54 are provided with an open aperture 60 between the first side 56 of the support bracket member 54 and the second side 58 of the support bracket 54.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The flotation assembly 52 is further provided with threaded rods 62 disposed through the open apertures 60 of the support bracket members 54.
      <br/>
      The threaded rods 62 are provided with positioning jam nuts 64 located at the first side 56 and the second side 58 of the support bracket members 54 for removably engaging the threaded rods 62 at preferred variable positions.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The flotation assembly 52 is further provided with buoyant flotation members 66 which can have attached internally threaded connectors 68.
      <br/>
      The flotation members 66 are suitably round or cylindrical in shape to prevent debris from accumulating on the surfaces thereof.
      <br/>
      Internally threaded connectors 68 are attached to threaded rods 62 to create removable connections between the flotation members 66 and the threaded rods 62.
      <br/>
      Locking jam nuts 70 are provided to removably affix internally threaded connectors 68 of flotation members 66 to threaded rods 62.
      <br/>
      Positioning jam nuts 64 are provided to removably engage threaded rods 62 engaged with flotation members 66 to support bracket members 54.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The inlet first end 38 of elongated body skimming sleeve member 36 engaged to support bracket members 54 can be adjustably positioned at variable preferred distances from the surface of the fluid body 16 by increasing or decreasing the distance between flotation members 66 and support bracket members 54.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Increasing the distance between flotation members 66 and support bracket members 54, in direct connection with the skimming sleeve elongated body member 36 having an inlet at first end 38, causes an increase in the distance from the surface of the upper fluid layer 12 of the fluid body 14 to the inlet first end 38.
      <br/>
      Decreasing the distance between flotation members 66 and support bracket members 54, in direct connection with the skimming sleeve elongated body member 36 having an inlet at first end 38, causes a decrease in the distance from the surface of the upper fluid layer 12 of the fluid body 14 to the inlet first end 38.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The suction skimmer 18 further includes a sleeve guide member 72 having a first end 74, and a second end 76.
      <br/>
      The sleeve guide member 72 is further provided with an outside diameter 78, an inside diameter 80, an outer peripheral surface 82 and an inner peripheral surface 84.
      <br/>
      The sleeve guide member is further provided with a fluid passageway 86.
      <br/>
      The outside diameter 78 of the sleeve guide member 72 is less than the inside diameter 42 of the skimming sleeve member 36.
      <br/>
      The sleeve guide member 72 is vertically positioned so as to provide substantially vertical alignment for the skimming sleeve elongated body member 36.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The first end 74 of the sleeve guide member 72 is slidably positioned in the fluid flow passageway 46 of the skimming sleeve member 36 so that the inner peripheral surface 48 of skimming sleeve member 36 is disposed about the outer peripheral surface 82 of the sleeve guide member 72.
      <br/>
      Fluid communication under substantially vortical flow conditions is established between the fluid passageway 46 of the skimming sleeve member 36 and the fluid passageway 86 of the sleeve guide member 72.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The second end of the sleeve guide member 76 is connected to the vessel fluid outlet 22 of the vessel 16 by any conventional means as long as a fluid tight connection is formed between the second end 76 of the sleeve guide member 72 and the vessel fluid outlet 22, while maintaining fluid communication between the fluid flow passageway 86 of the sleeve guide member 72 and the fluid outlet 22 of the vessel 16.
      <br/>
      For example, the second end 76 of the sleeve guide member 72 may be provided with externally disposed threads which are adapted to matingly engage internally disposed threads (not shown) in the vessel fluid outlet 22 or standard threaded couplings as needed (not shown) to form a fluid tight connection.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Skimmed fluids from a preferred upper layer 12 of fluid body 14 enter the suction skimmer 18 at the first end 38 of the skimming sleeve member 36 and are withdrawn from fluid body 14 for processing in an effluent separation or purification system 26.</p>
    <p num="27">In one aspect of the present invention the suction skimmer 18 is self-leveling in response to changing levels in the fluid body 14.</p>
    <p num="28">In another aspect of the present invention the suction skimmer 18 can be preferably adjusted to efficiently skim fluids from a large array of variable preferred distances from the surface of the upper layer 12 of the fluid body 14.</p>
    <p num="29">
      In another aspect of the present invention the suction skimmer 18 can be preferably adjusted to substantially exclude the topmost fluid layers of the upper layer 12 of the fluid body 14 by adjusting flotation assembly 52 to position first end 38 of skimming sleeve member 36 above the surface of the upper layer 12 of the fluid body 14.
      <br/>
      In this aspect the inlet to the suction skimmer is the second end 40 of skimming sleeve member 36.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In another aspect of the present invention the suction skimmer 18 can be provided with a restraining means so as to restrict the total movement of the skimming sleeve member 36 to the maximum length of the elongated body of skimming sleeve member 36.
      <br/>
      This aspect insures that the skimming sleeve member 36 does not become disengaged form the sleeve guide member 72 during high fluid level conditions or surface turbulence.
    </p>
