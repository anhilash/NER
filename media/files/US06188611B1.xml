    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a non-volatile semiconductor memory device (EEPROM) capable of electrically rewriting data, which device is constituted by memory cells each having a MOS transistor structure having a charge storage layer and a control gate, and more particularly, to an EEPROM for writing/erasing data in/from each memory cell using a tunnel current.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description or the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In the field of EEPROMs, a memory cell of a MOS transistor structure having a charge storage layer (floating gate) and a control gate is widely used, and there is a growing trend toward higher integration densities.
      <br/>
      This memory cell is capable of electrically writing data by exchanging charges between the floating gate and the semiconductor substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In a device of this type, when a data erase operation is to be performed, a high electric field is applied to the tunnel oxide film of each memory cell between the floating gate and the semiconductor, posing problems in terms of dielectric breakdown and leakage current.
      <br/>
      In a data write operation, a high electric field is applied to the tunnel oxide film, and hence a great stress is applied thereto.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the tunnel oxide film of each memory cell deteriorates after the device is used for a predetermined period of time.
      <br/>
      This deterioration in the tunnel oxide film will reduce the resistance of cell data to a stress acting on each cell in a cell data read operation, and shorten the service life of cell data.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      As one of the above EEPROMs, a NAND-type EEPROM which allows a high integration density is known.
      <br/>
      In a NAND-type EEPROM, a plurality of memory cells are connected in series such that the respective adjacent memory cells share sources and drains.
      <br/>
      These memory cells are connected, as a unit, to a bit line.
      <br/>
      Each memory cell generally has an FET structure in which a charge storage layer and a control gate are stacked on each other.
      <br/>
      A memory cell array is integrally formed in a p-type well formed in a p- or n-type substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The drain and source sides of a NAND cell are respectively connected to a bit line and a source line (reference potential line) via selection gates.
      <br/>
      The control gates of the respective memory cells are continuously connected to each other in the row direction to constitute a word line.
      <br/>
      In general, a set of cells connected to the same word line is called a page, and a set of pages between a pair of selection gates on the drain and source sides is called a NAND block or simply a block.
      <br/>
      In general, one block is the minimum unit which can be independently erased.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The NAND-type EEPROM is operated as follows.</p>
    <p num="9">
      A data erase operation is performed with respect to the memory cells in one NAND block at once.
      <br/>
      All the control gates of a selected NAND block are set at VSS, and a high voltage Vpp (e.g., 20 V) is applied to the p-type well and the n-type substrate.
      <br/>
      With this operation, electrons are discharged from the floating gates of all the memory cells, and the threshold value of each memory cell shifts in the negative-value direction (normally, this state is defined as a "1" state).
      <br/>
      A chip erase operation is performed by setting all the NAND blocks in a selected state.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A data write operation is sequentially performed from the memory cell located farthest from the bit line.
      <br/>
      A high voltage Vpp (e.g., 20 V) is applied to a selected control gate in a NAND block, and an intermediate potential VM (e.g., 10 V) is applied to the remaining non-selected control gates.
      <br/>
      A potential VSS or VbitH (8 V) is applied to the bit line in accordance with data.
      <br/>
      When the potential VSS is applied to the bit line ("0" write operation), the potential is transferred to the selected memory cell, and electrons are injected into the floating gate.
      <br/>
      As a result, the threshold value of the selected memory cell shifts in the positive-value direction (normally this state is defined as a "0" state).
      <br/>
      When the potential VbitH is applied to the bit line ("1" write operation), since no electrons are injected into the memory cell, the threshold value of the memory cell does not change and remains negative.
      <br/>
      The potential VM is applied to the drain-side selection gate to transfer the bit line potential.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      A data read operation is performed as follows.
      <br/>
      The control gate of a selected memory cell in a NAND block is set at VSS, and the remaining control gates and the selection gates are set at VCC.
      <br/>
      In this state, it is checked whether a current flows in the selected memory cell.
      <br/>
      The readout data is latched in a sense amplifier/data latch circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="12">A write verify cycle will be described below.</p>
    <p num="13">
      After write data is input, a set voltage (e.g., 20 V) is applied to selected control gates for a set time (e.g., 40  MU sec), Thereafter, a read operation is performed to confirm the completion of the write operation.
      <br/>
      If there are any memory cells which have undergone an insufficient write operation, a write operation is performed again with respect to these memory cells by applying a voltage of 20 V thereto for 40  MU sec.
      <br/>
      At this time, with respect to memory cells which have undergone a sufficient write operation, the potential VbitH is applied to the bit line to prevent further electron injection.
      <br/>
      That is, the write operation with a voltage of 20 V and a writing time of 40  MU sec is repeated until the data is completely written in all the memory cells.

    <p num="16">In the above write method of verifying data in units of blocks (or chips), a method of writing data while increasing the voltage (high voltage Vpp) applied to each control gate so as to shorten the programming time is known (to be referred to as a chip-by-chip verify voltage increasing method hereinafter).</p>
    <p num="17">
      This write method will be described below with reference to FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In the method, a program is written by the following procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      There are variations in process and threshold value among the respective memory cells.
      <br/>
      For example, in this case, the threshold value of a memory cell having the minimum threshold value (i.e., a hardest cell M2 to write thereto) is set to be Vth =-4 V (A0 in FIG. 1); a memory cell having the maximum threshold value (i.e., an easiest memory cell M1 to write thereto) is set to be Vth =-1 V (B0 in FIG. 1); and the threshold value of a memory cell in which "0" is written is set to fall within the range of 0.5 V to 2 V.
    </p>
    <p num="19">A page (or a chip) is selected first.</p>
    <p num="20">The potential VSS (e.g., 0 V) for "0" write operation or the potential VbitH (e.g., 10 V) for "0" write operation is applied to the bit line connected to each memory cell of the selected page in accordance with data to be written.</p>
    <p num="21">Thereafter, the first write operation is performed by applying the high voltage Vpp (e.g., 18.5 V) to each selected word line (i.e., the control gate of each selected memory cell).</p>
    <p num="22">
      Upon completion of the first write operation, it is checked whether the threshold value Vth of each memory cell has reached a completion determination level (verify operation).
      <br/>
      At this time, the threshold value Vth of the memory cell M1 is 0 V (B1), and the threshold value Vth of the memory cell M2 is -3 V (A1).
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Since both the threshold values Vth of the memory cells M1 and M2 are lower than a predetermined value, it is determined that the write processing is not completed.
      <br/>
      As a result, a constant voltage Vpp (e.g., 19.5 V) higher than the voltage applied in the first write operation is applied to each selected word line, thus performing the second write operation.
      <br/>
      With the second write operation, the threshold value Vth of the memory cell M1 becomes 3 V (B3), and hence falls within the predetermined range.
      <br/>
      However, the threshold value Vth of the memory cell M2 is -0.5 V (A3), and hence falls outside the predetermined range.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is determined that the write processing is not completed.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In order to perform a write operation with respect to the memory cell M2, a constant voltage Vpp (e.g., 20.5 V) higher than the voltage applied in the second write operation is applied to each selected word line, thus performing the third write operation.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, verify and write operations are performed, while the voltage of the selected word line is gradually increased, until the write processing with respect to the hardest memory cell M2 to write thereto is completed (the threshold value falls within the predetermined range).

      <br/>
      That is, data is written in all memory cells by using the same voltage Vpp.

    <p num="27">
      The programming time, therefore, can be shortened.

      A voltage of 10 V is applied to bit lines connected to memory cells (not shown) for which no write operation is to be performed and memory cells for which data processing is completed, and a voltage of 0 V is applied to a bit line connected to memory cells for which write processing is not completed.
      <br/>
      In addition, the same voltage Vpp (18.5 V) as that applied in the first write operation is applied to each selected word line for a slightly longer period of time than in the first write operation.

    <p num="39">
      In the above method, since data is verified in units of memory cells, over-programming with respect to memory cells can be prevented.

      <br/>
      All the memory cells on a selected page are programmed by the same voltage Vpp (18.5 V).
      <br/>
      Since a memory cell exhibiting a low programming speed (a hard memory cell to write thereto) and a memory cell exhibiting a high programming speed (an easy memory cell to write thereto) are programmed by the same voltage, it takes much time to completely program all the memory cells.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="40">It is an object of the present invention to provide a non-volatile semiconductor memory device which can prevent a dielectric breakdown of a tunnel oxide film and an increase in leakage current in data erase and write operations, and can improve the reliability of each memory cell.</p>
    <p num="41">It is another object of the present invention to provide a non-volatile semiconductor memory device having a write verify scheme which can suppress an increase in writing time even if cell characteristics vary.</p>
    <p num="42">It is still another object of the present invention to provide an EEPROM which can ensure a sufficient writing voltage Vpp margin, can reduce the width of the threshold value distribution of memory cells, and can perform electron injection at high speed.</p>
    <p num="43">
      The gist of the present invention is to program with the optimal program condition by bit during a page programming.
      <br/>
      This technology is named as bit by bit program voltage selected page programming method.
      <br/>
      A specific embodiment is to gradually increase a writing voltage Vpp (or gradually decrease a voltage VCC of a selected gate) while a write operation/bit-by-bit verify operation cycle is repeated.
      <br/>
      The writing voltage Vpp is increased by  DELTA  Vpp for every cycle, and a writing time  DELTA  t for one write operation is made constant.
      <br/>
      In addition, the values  DELTA  Vpp and  DELTA  t are set such that the width of a threshold value distribution after a "0" write operation becomes the value  DELTA  Vpp.
    </p>
    <p num="44">The characteristic features of the present invention will be described in more detail below.</p>
    <p num="45">A non-volatile semiconductor memory device according to the first aspect of the invention is characterized by comprising: a semiconductor substrate; a memory cell including source and drain regions formed in a surface region of the semiconductor substrate, and a first gate insulating film, a charge storage layer, a second gate insulating film, and a control gate sequentially stacked on the semiconductor substrate, the memory cell being capable of electrically rewriting data by exchanging charges; and means for applying a high potential to the semiconductor substrate and an intermediate potential to the control gate in a first data erase operation, and applying a high potential to the semiconductor substrate and a low potential to the control gate in second and subsequent data erase operations, thereby removing electrons from the charge storage layer.</p>
    <p num="46">A non-volatile semiconductor memory device according to another first aspect of the invention is characterized by comprising: a semiconductor substrate; a plurality of memory cells, each including source and drain regions formed in a surface region of the semiconductor substrate, and a first gate insulating film, a charge storage layer, a second gate insulating film, and a control gate sequentially stacked on the semiconductor substrate, the memory cells being capable of electrically rewriting data by exchanging charges between the charge storage layers and the semiconductor substrates and being arranged in the form of a matrix; and means for applying a high potential to the semiconductor substrate and the control gate of each non-selected memory cell and applying an intermediate potential to the control gate of a selected memory cell in a first data erase operation, and applying a high potential to the semiconductor substrate and the control gate of each non-selected memory cell and applying a potential lower than the intermediate potential to the control gate of the selected memory cell in second and subsequent data erase operations, thereby removing electrons from the charge storage layer.</p>
    <p num="47">
      According to the first aspect of the present invention, before a data write operation is performed, the data in each memory cell is data "1" or "0".
      <br/>
      In this case, the threshold value of a memory cell having data "0" is higher than a reference potential.
      <br/>
      That is, many electrons are injected into the charge storage layer.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, a high potential is applied to the substrate to discharge the electrons from the charge storage layer to the substrate, thereby erasing the data.
      <br/>
      When data "0" is stored, since electrons are present in the charge storage layer, a higher electric field is applied to the tunnel oxide film.
    </p>
    <p num="48">In the first aspect, the high potential is a boosted potential, the intermediate potential is a power supply potential, and the low potential is a ground potential.</p>
    <p num="49">
      According to the present invention, in the first erase operation, a high potential (to be referred to as, for example, an "H"-level potential) is applied to the substrate, and an intermediate potential (to be referred to as, for example, an "M" level) is applied to the control gate.
      <br/>
      In practice, a voltage applied between the gate and the substrate corresponds to the difference between the "H"- and "M"-level potentials, and the peak electric field applied to the tunnel oxide film is reduced.
      <br/>
      At this time, the threshold value shifts in the negative-value direction, and the number of electrons in the charge storage layer decreases.
      <br/>
      In the second erase operation, for example, an "H"-level potential is applied to the substrate, and a low potential (to be referred as an "L"-level potential) or a potential lower than the "M"-level potential is applied to the control gate.
      <br/>
      With this operation, although a higher voltage is applied, the peak electric field applied to the tunnel oxide film can be suppressed because electrons are removed from the charge storage layer, and its potential is decreased.
      <br/>
      In this case, a potential of the control gate and the substrate thereof may be inversely set and may use during the program.
    </p>
    <p num="50">In the above-described manner, the peak electric field applied to the tunnel oxide film is suppressed, and the problems of a dielectric breakdown and an increase in leakage current can be solved.</p>
    <p num="51">A non-volatile semiconductor memory device according to the second aspect of the invention is characterized by comprising: a memory cell array including a plurality of memory cells, which are arranged in matrix, capable of electrically rewriting and erasing data and connected in series such that the memory cells share drains and sources; a plurality of bit lines coupled to the drain of the memory cells; a plurality of word lines which are control gates of the memory cells; write means for, when a page write operation is to be performed, applying a first writing potential to a selected word line, applying a first bit line potential to a bit line which is connected to the selected word line and to which a memory cell a memory cell in which data is to be written is connected, and applying a second bit line potential to a bit line which is connected to the selected word line and to which a memory cell in which no data is to be written is connected; and rewrite means for reading out data written by the write means, causing the write means to perform a write operation again if there is a memory cell which has undergone an insufficient write operation, and sequentially increasing the first writing potential in accordance with the number of times of write operations.</p>
    <p num="52">The rewrite means is characterized by including means for variably setting the first and second bit line potentials.</p>
    <p num="53">
      According to the second aspect of the present invention, a writing voltage Vpp applied to each selected control gate of a selected block, a bit line potential transfer potential VM applied to each non-selected control gate of the selected gate, a bit line potential VbitH applied to each cell in which "1" is to be written, and the like are controlled in accordance with the number of times of verify write operations.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a predetermined number of times of write operations is detected, and these voltages are increased within predetermined ranges.
      <br/>
      For example, in a conventional scheme, the same Vpp pulse voltage is repeatedly applied (20 V-20 V-20V).
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the Vpp pulse voltage is sequentially increased from 19 V to 21 V at a rate of 1 V (19 V-20 V-21 V-21V).
      <br/>
      In addition, the set voltage is increased in accordance with a predetermined relationship between the potentials VM and VbitH.
      <br/>
      As described above, terminating potential of Vpp (e.g., 21 V) is determined by a rated potential of the device.
    </p>
    <p num="54">With the above arrangement, the following effects can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="55">
      First, an effect obtained by decreasing the first writing potential will be described.
      <br/>
      The first writing voltage is lower than that in the conventional scheme.
      <br/>
      If a limiter exhibits a variation in the direction of higher voltages (+0.5 V), a voltage of 20.5 V is output with respect to a set voltage of 20 V in the conventional scheme.
      <br/>
      As a result, the easiest memory cell to write thereto with a 40- MU sec pulse reaches 2 V which is the upper limit of a threshold value distribution.
      <br/>
      This pulse width determines the minimum pulse width.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      In the present invention, even if a limiter exhibits a variation in the direction of higher voltages, since the first writing voltage is set to be lower than that in the conventional scheme by 1 V, the threshold value of even the easiest memory cell to write thereto exceeds 2 V with a 200- MU sec pulse.
      <br/>
      That is, with a 40- MU sec pulse, even if the output voltage of the limiter shifts in the direction of higher voltages, the threshold value does not exceed the upper limit of a threshold value distribution.
      <br/>
      As a result, process control of the limiter is facilitated to improve the yield.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Second, an effect obtained by increasing the writing voltage in the second and third operations will be described.
      <br/>
      Consider a case wherein the limiter exhibits a variation in the direction of lower voltages.
      <br/>
      In the conventional scheme, a voltage of 19.5 V is output with respect to a set voltage of 20 V. In this case, a writing time of 400  MU sec is required to write data in the easiest memory cell to write thereto up to a lower limit of 0.5 V. In the above case with the minimum pulse width being 40  MU sec, write and verify operations must be repeated 10 times at maximum.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      According to the present invention, since the writing voltage is gradually increased, the voltage of the first write pulse is lower than that in the conventional scheme.
      <br/>
      However, the writing voltage is increased in the second and third operations.
      <br/>
      Even if, therefore, the voltage in the third and subsequent operations is fixed, data is written in the memory cell up to the threshold value lower limit (0.5 V) with five writing operations using a 40- MU sec write pulse.
      <br/>
      The writing time is shortened to 1/2 the writing time in the conventional scheme.
      <br/>
      The writing time is shortened more as the threshold value distribution (calculated as q1 V in the above case) without a verify operation expands.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Third, the reliability of a memory cell will be described.
      <br/>
      It is known that a deterioration in a memory is greatly associated with the maximum electric field applied to the tunnel oxide film in a write operation.
      <br/>
      Consider the easiest memory cell to write thereto in a case wherein a limiter exhibits a variation in the direction of higher voltages in a conventional method.
      <br/>
      Before the first write operation, each memory cell is in an erased state and has a negative threshold value.
      <br/>
      In general, an easy memory cell to write thereto is a memory cell which can be easily erased, and hence has a large negative value.
      <br/>
      When a writing voltage exhibiting a variation in the direction of higher voltages is applied to this memory cell, a very high electric field is applied to the tunnel oxide film, resulting in a deterioration in the memory cell.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      According to the present invention, since the writing voltage for the first write operation is set to be low, only a low electric field is applied to the tunnel oxide film as compared with the conventional method.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a deterioration in the memory cell can be suppressed.
    </p>
    <p num="61">Fourth, consider a case wherein the bit line potential transfer voltage VM applied to each non-selected control gate of a selected block and the bit line potential VbitH applied to each cell in which "1" is written are increased with an increase in Vpp.</p>
    <p num="62">
      Vpp and VbitH are respectively applied to the control gate and source/drain of each memory cell in which "1" is written and each memory cell in which "0" is completely written so as not to inject electrons therein any more.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a write error can be prevented by increasing VbitH with an increase in Vpp.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the voltage VM of each non-selected gate is increased to transfer VbitH.
      <br/>
      Since each memory cell connected to a non-selected control gate is subjected to a weak write mode in which VM and VSS are respectively applied to the gate and the source/drain, Vpp and VbitH need to be increased proportionately to prevent a write error.
    </p>
    <p num="63">As described above, according to the present invention, an improvement in the reliability of each memory cell and a high-speed write operation can be achieved at the same time.</p>
    <p num="64">A non-volatile semiconductor memory device according to the third aspect of the invention is characterized by further comprising means for setting a rise time of a first write pulse to be longer than a rise time of second and subsequent pulses in a data write operation using a plurality of pulses in addition to the device of the first aspect.</p>
    <p num="65">
      The effects of the third aspect of the present invention will be described below.
      <br/>
      Consider an EEPROM in which a data write or erase operation is performed by supplying an F-N tunnel current to the entire gate insulating film of a memory cell to store negative or positive charges in the charge storage layer.
      <br/>
      It is known that in general, as the F-N tunnel current flows in the gate insulating film, a leakage current on the low-electric-field side increases, and the data holding characteristics deteriorate.
      <br/>
      It is also known that the degree of this deterioration in the gate insulating film depends on an electric field applied to the gate insulating film, and can be suppressed by reducing the electric field.
    </p>
    <p num="66">In a memory cell, letting C1 be the capacitance of a capacitor constituted by the substrate and the charge storage layer, C2 be the capacitance of a capacitor constituted by the charge storage layer and the control gate, Vpp is the potential applied to the control gate in a write operation, V1 is the potential difference applied to the capacitance C1, Q be the charges stored in the charge storage layer, and Tox be the thickness of the gate insulating film, an electric field Eox applied to the gate insulating film can be given by</p>
    <p num="67">
      In an EEPROM using n-channel cell transistors, a write operation is performed by injecting electrons into a charge storage layer to store negative electrons therein.
      <br/>
      It is, therefore, apparent that the electric field Eox decreases as write processing progresses.
      <br/>
      In this case, injection of electrons is performed by using the F-N tunnel current, and the intensity of the F-N tunnel current is highly proportional to the electric field Eox applied to the gate (tunnel) insulating film.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a decrease in the electric field Eox with the progress of write processing is equivalent to a degradation in electron injecting efficiency with the progress of write processing.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Similar to the first aspect of the present invention, a high voltage as the voltage Vpp is required when write processing progresses to a certain extent, but a sufficient injecting efficiency can be obtained by using a relatively low voltage as the voltage Vpp in the initial period of the write processing.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the maximum value of the electric field Eox applied to the gate insulating film can be suppressed to a low value by decreasing the voltage Vpp in the initial period of the write processing, thereby reducing a deterioration in the gate insulating film.
      <br/>
      More specifically, this effect can be obtained by prolonging the rise time of the first pulse of a plurality of pulses in a write operation.
      <br/>
      As the rise time is prolonged, a greater effect is expected.
      <br/>
      However, in consideration of a writing speed, it is not practical to prolong the rise time too much.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      In a write operation using the second and subsequent pulses, since a certain amount of charges are stored in the charge storage layer, even if the pulse rise time is prolonged, the effect for the deterioration in the gate insulating film cannot be expected as much as in the first write operation.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the pulse rise time need not be prolonged any more.
      <br/>
      The extent to which the rise time of the first pulse is prolonged is determined in consideration of a writing speed.
      <br/>
      However, if at least the rise time of the first pulse is set to be longer than a normal rise time (the rise time of the second and subsequent pulses), a deterioration in the gate insulating film can be suppressed as compared with that in a normal write operation.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      According to the first to third aspects of the present invention, since the peak electric field applied to a tunnel oxide film in a data erase or write operation can be suppressed, a dielectric breakdown of the tunnel oxide film and an increase in leakage current can be prevented, thus improving the reliability of each memory cell.
      <br/>
      A write verify scheme can be realized, in which even if cell characteristics vary, the prolongation of the writing time can be suppressed by controlling the writing potential in accordance with the number of times of write operations.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="81">Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="82">
      The gist of the present invention is to gradually increase a writing voltage Vpp (or gradually decrease a voltage VCC of a selected gate) while a write operation/bit-by-bit verify operation cycle is repeated.
      <br/>
      First, the features of the invention will be explained.
    </p>
    <p num="83">The features of the present invention will be described below with reference to FIGS. 3 to 5.</p>
    <p num="84">The present invention will be described with reference to FIG. 3.</p>
    <p num="85">In this case, a memory cell having the minimum threshold value (i.e., a hardest memory cell M2 to write thereto) is set to be Vth =-4 V (E0 in FIG. 3); a memory cell having the maximum threshold value (i.e., an easiest memory cell M1 to write thereto) is set to be Vth =-1 V (F0 in FIG. 3); and the threshold value Vth of a memory cell in which "0" is to be written is set to fall within the range of 0.5 V to 2 V.</p>
    <p num="86">A given page (or a chip) is selected.</p>
    <p num="87">
      A potential VSS (e.g., 0 V) for a "0" write operation or a potential VbitH (e.g., 10 V) for a "1" write operation is applied to a bit line connected to each memory cell of the selected page in accordance with data to be written.
      <br/>
      In this case, there are process variations among the respective memory cells and variations in threshold value depending on the used states of the memory cells (i.e., Vpp is applied to a selected page).
    </p>
    <p num="88">The first write operation is performed by applying a high voltage Vpp (=18.5 V) to each selected word line (i.e., the control gate of each selected memory cell).</p>
    <p num="89">
      Upon completion of the first write operation, it is checked whether the threshold value Vth of each memory cell has reached a completion determination level (verify operation).
      <br/>
      In this case, the threshold value Vth of the memory cell M1 is 1 V (E1), and hence falls within the predetermined range.
      <br/>
      However, the threshold value Vth of the memory cell M2 is -2 V (F1), and hence falls outside the predetermined range.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is determined that the write processing is not completed.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      A voltage of 10 V is applied to bit lines connected to memory cells (not shown) for which no write operation is to be performed and memory cells for which data processing is completed, and a voltage of 0 V is applied to a bit line connected to memory cells for which write processing is not completed.
      <br/>
      In addition, a constant voltage Vpp (19.5 V) higher than that applied in the first write operation is applied to each selected word line, thus performing the second write operation.
      <br/>
      With the second write operation, the threshold value Vth of the memory cell M1 becomes 3 V (F3), and hence falls within the predetermined range.
      <br/>
      However, the threshold value Vth is -0.5 V (E3), and hence falls outside the predetermined range.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is determined that the write processing is not completed.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      In order to write data in the memory cell M2, a constant voltage Vpp (e.g., 20.5 V) higher than the voltage applied in the second write operation is applied to the selected word line, thus performing the third write operation.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, verify and write operations are performed while the voltage applied to the selected word line is gradually increased until the write processing with respect to the hardest memory cell M2 to write thereto is completed (the threshold value falls within the predetermined range).
      <br/>
      Therefore, since memory cells having slow program characteristics is programmed by 20.5 V, and memory cells having fast program characteristics is programmed by 19.5 V, memory cells are programmed by optimal Vpp.
      <br/>
      The inventors calls this method as a bit-by-bit Vpp (program voltage) selected page program method (technology).
    </p>
    <p num="92">With the above processing, no memory cell is subjected to over-programming as in the bit-by-bit verify fixed voltage method, and the prolongation of the programming time as in the chip-by-chip verify voltage increasing method can be prevented.</p>
    <p num="93">
      FIG. 4 is a graph showing the relationship between the programming time and the width of the threshold value distribution of the respective memory cells after write processing.
      <br/>
      In this graph, the ordinate indicates the programming time, and the abscissa indicates the range of threshold voltage variations.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 4, a curve A indicates the case of the chip-by-chip verify voltage increasing method; a curve B, the case of the bit-by-bit verify fixed voltage method; and a curve C, the case of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="94">In the case of the chip-by-chip verify voltage increasing method, the width of the threshold value distribution of the respective memory cells cannot be corrected by a program, and does not depend on the programming time.</p>
    <p num="95">
      In the case of the bit-by-bit verify fixed voltage method, as variations in the threshold values of the respective memory cells after write processing are to be made small, a longer writing time is required.
      <br/>
      For example, if the width of the threshold value distribution is 2 V, the writing time is about 500  MU sec.
      <br/>
      If, however, the width of the threshold value distribution is 1 V, the writing time is prolonged about three times.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      As compared with the above two methods, in the present invention, if the threshold value variation is set to be 0.5 V, the writing time is about 300  MU sec.
      <br/>
      That is, write processing can be performed with a small threshold value variation without requiring a long writing time.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      FIG. 5 is a graph showing the relationship between the maximum electric field (peak electric field) and the coupling factor.
      <br/>
      In this graph, the ordinate indicates the maximum electric field; and the ordinate, the coupling factor.
      <br/>
      Since the types of curves in FIG. 5 are the same as those in FIG. 4, a description thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Referring to FIG. 5, curves A and C have almost the same characteristics.
      <br/>
      A curve B indicates that as the coupling factor increases, the maximum electric field increases (if, for example, the coupling factor is 0.5, the maximum electric field is about 1.2 times that indicated by the curves A and C).
      <br/>
      Therefore, the peak electric field applied to a tunnel oxide film increase, and problems are posed in terms of dielectric breakdown and leakage current.

      As described above, in the data erase mode, in the first erase pulse applying operation, a voltage of "M" level is applied to the word lines to change the threshold value while an electric field applied to the tunnel oxide film is kept low.

      In the second and subsequent operations, a high electric field is applied to the tunnel oxide film to suppress a peak electric field applied to the tunnel oxide film.

    <p num="129">Table 2 shows a case wherein the writing voltage is increased to two levels from 19 V to 20 V and 21 V. In this case, when the writing voltage is increased by 2 V, the bit line potential and the selection gate SGD potential are increased by 1 V.</p>
    <p num="130">Table 3 shows a case wherein as the writing voltage is increased, the bit line potential and the selection gate potential VM are increased.</p>
    <p num="131">
      Each of the above voltages is not limited to the value in the embodiment but may be properly changed.
      <br/>
      For example, in each of the above cases, the voltage is increased 1 V at a time.
      <br/>
      However, this voltage may be increased 0.5 V or 2 V at a time.
      <br/>
      In addition, the voltage need not be increased regularly.
      <br/>
      For example, the increase may be gradually decreased in the following manner: 19 V-20 V-20.5 V-20.7 V. In contrast to this, the increase may be gradually increased.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      In the first embodiment, the voltage is changed for each operation.
      <br/>
      However, for example, the voltage may be changed for every other operation in the following manner: 19 V-19 V-20 V-20 V-21 V-21 V. Alternatively, the voltage may be increased for each of set operations in the following manner: 19 V-20V-20 V-21 V-21 V-21 V. Similarly, a high degree of freedom is allowed in methods of increasing bit line potentials VbitH and VM.
      <br/>
      As is apparent, the two potentials may be fixed if there is a sufficient voltage margin for write errors.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      The timings of increasing the potentials need not is coincide with the timing of increasing the writing voltage, as in the above embodiment, but may be independently controlled.
      <br/>
      In the above embodiment, VPP is gradually increased.
      <br/>
      However, in order to increase the potential difference between the control gate and the source-drain path, the bit line potential may be decreased while the writing voltage is fixed.
      <br/>
      As shown in Table 4, the bit line potential may be decreased stepwise.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      Both the potentials VbitH and VM need not be increased.
      <br/>
      For example, only the potential VbitH may be increased while the potential VM is fixed (Table 5).
      <br/>
      In this case, however, the increased potential VbitH must be transferred to a selected memory cell.
      <br/>
      The potentials VbitH and VM may be equal to each other.
      <br/>
      In this case, since a voltage drop by the threshold value occurs at the drain-side selection gate, a voltage corresponding to the drop by the threshold value is transferred to the bit line.
      <br/>
      In contrast to this, the potential VM applied to the selection gate line SGD may differ from the potential VM applied to a non-selected memory cell.

    <p num="135">A write verify scheme will be described with reference to the sense amplifier/data latch circuit (FF) shown in FIG. 15.</p>
    <p num="136">
      As shown in FIG. 15, the sense amplifier/data latch circuit (FF) is constituted by a CMOS flip-flop.
      <br/>
      The first output of this circuit is connected to a bit line BLi via an E type n-channel MOS transistor Qn7 which is controlled by a signal  PHI F. E type n-channel MOS transistors Qn8 and Qn9, which are respectively controlled by the first output of the flip-flop FF and a signal  PHI V, are connected in series between the bit line BLi and VCC.
      <br/>
      An E type p-channel MOS transistor Qp5 for precharging the bit line and an E type n-channel MOS transistor Qn10 for discharging the bit line are connected to the bit line.
      <br/>
      A sense line VDTC is connected to VSS via a detection transistor Qn11 for receiving the second output from the flip-flop FF.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      In the write mode, when a "1" write operation is to be performed, the bit-line-side node of the flip-flop FF is latched at "H" level, and an intermediate potential is transferred to the bit line.
      <br/>
      When a "0" write operation is to be performed, the bit-line-side node of the flip-flop FF is latched at "L" level, and the potential VSS is transferred to the bit line.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      In a write verify operation, while the transistor Qn7 is kept on, a precharge signal  PHI PB is set at "L" level to precharge the bit line to VCC.
      <br/>
      In this state, write data is held in the flip-flop FF.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the selection and control gates are driven.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the cell data is of a D type, the bit line discharged to VSS.
      <br/>
      If the cell data is of an E type, the bit line is held at "VCC " level.
      <br/>
      After the selection and control gates are reset, and a verify signal  PHI V is set at "H" level.
      <br/>
      As a result, the bit line in which data "1" is held is charged to VCC -Vth.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, a CMOS inverter constituting the flip-flop FF is inactivated, and the transistor Qn7 is turned on.
      <br/>
      With this operation, the potential of the bit line is sensed, latched, and used as data to be written again.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      Each bit line in which "1" is written is latched at "H" level, and each bit line in which "0" is written and for which a write operation is sufficiently performed is latched at "H" level.
      <br/>
      In addition, each bit line in which "0" is written and for which a write operation is not sufficiently performed is latched at "L" level.
      <br/>
      The write operation is continued until the bit-line-side nodes of all the flip-flops FF are latched at "H"0 level.
    </p>
    <p num="140">Written states are detected in the following manner.</p>
    <p num="141">
      The detection transistors of all the flip-flops FF are connected to a sense line SL.
      <br/>
      The sense line VDTC is connected to a p-channel transistor QPK.
      <br/>
      After a latch operation, the transistor QPK is activated for a predetermined period of time.
      <br/>
      If write processing with respect to all the bits has been completed at this time, all the detection transistors are in an OFF state.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the sense line VDTC is charged to VCC.
      <br/>
      If cells which have undergone an insufficient write operation are left, since the detection transistors corresponding to the bit lines of these cells are in an ON state, the potential of the sense line VDTC decreases to VSS.
      <br/>
      Therefore, by detecting the potential of the sense line VDTC the completion of the write operation can be detected at once (unlike the case wherein all the bits are read out by changing the address).
      <br/>
      If the write processing is not completed, a write operation is performed again.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      FIG. 16 shows a limiter circuit for realizing the above write operation.
      <br/>
      In this case, a reverse-biased diode D is connected to the output of a step-up circuit 29 via a p-type transistor Mp.
      <br/>
      The breakdown voltage of the diode D is set to be 9.5 V per step.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      Assume that signals  PHI 1 and  PHI 2 are set at VSS in the first write operation.
      <br/>
      In this case, since nodes N1 and N3 are short-circuited via p-type transistors Mp3 and Mp4, 19 V is output as Vpp.
      <br/>
      In the second write operation, the signals  PHI 1 and  PHI 2 are respectively set at Vpp and VSS.
      <br/>
      In this case, although a node N2 and the node N3 are short-circuited, the voltage between the nodes N1 and N2 drops by a threshold value Vth of a p-type transistor Mp1.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the threshold value of this p-type transistor is 1 V, the output Vpp is 20 V. Similarly, in the third write operation, both the signals  PHI 1 and  PHI 2 are set at Vpp.
      <br/>
      Consequently, 21 V is output as the output Vpp in accordance with a two-step voltage drop corresponding to the threshold values Vth.
    </p>
    <p num="144">A desired voltage can be obtained by controlling the limiter circuit upon detection of the number of times of write operations in the above-described manner.</p>
    <p num="145">
      The circuit shown in FIG. 16 uses the two p-type transistors.
      <br/>
      However, this arrangement may be variously modified.
      <br/>
      For example, transistors having different threshold values may be arranged to change the increased voltage, or three or more transistors having the same threshold value may be arranged to be divided into two transistors and one transistor.
      <br/>
      In addition, p- and n-type transistors may be coupled.
      <br/>
      A step-up circuit for VM and VbitH may be formed by a similar arrangement.

    <p num="146">A write/verity cycle may be automatically controlled within a chip or may be externally controlled.</p>
    <p num="147">
      When the cycle is to be automatically controlled within the chip, a counter circuit for storing the number of times of a write operation is arranged, and the set voltage of a set-up circuit limiter is switched in accordance with an output signal from the counter circuit or the like.
      <br/>
      A ready/busy pin is set in a busy state during a write/verify cycle, and completion of the write operation is confirmed by a verify read operation.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if the write processing is not completed after the write/verify operation is repeated a predetermined number of times, the ready/busy pin is restored to a ready state, and, for example, information indicating whether the verify operation is completed is output to a specific I/O pin.
      <br/>
      As is apparent, when or after the ready/busy pin is restored to the ready state, the counter circuit is reset at a predetermined timing by, for example, inputting a reset signal.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      When the write/verify cycle is to be controlled outside the chip, a data input command, a write command, a verify command, and the like are prepared.
      <br/>
      When a write operation is completed, a verify command is input.
      <br/>
      If the write operation is not completed, a write command is input again.
      <br/>
      At this time, a CPU or the like outside the chip stores the number of times of write operations.
      <br/>
      In such a control operation, for example, three types of write commands are prepared, to which output voltages from the step-up circuit are caused to correspond.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, the writing voltage can be controlled in accordance with the number of times of write operations.
    </p>
    <p num="149">With this write verify operation, the following effects can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="150">
      Since the writing voltage at the first operation is set to be lower than that in the conventional system, even if the threshold value of the limiter varies in the high-voltage direction, the threshold value does not exceed the upper limit of the threshold value distribution, thus facilitating the process control of the limiter.
      <br/>
      The number of times of verify operations can be reduced by gradually increasing the writing potential.
      <br/>
      This shortens the writing time.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the writing potential at the first operation in which the highest electric field is applied to the tunnel oxide film is set to be low, a deterioration in the tunnel oxide film can be prevented, and an improvement in the reliability of each memory cell can be realized.
    </p>
    <p num="151">Another write verify operation will be described below.</p>
    <p num="152">
      A memory cell array block in which data is to be written is selected.
      <br/>
      The data in the memory cells of all the NAND cells in the selected block are erased before a data write operation with respect to the block is performed.
      <br/>
      In a data erase operation, 0 V is applied to all the control gate lines (word lines) CG.
      <br/>
      At this time, the erase potential VE is applied to the selection gate lines SGS and SGD, the bit and source lines, and the p-type substrate (or the p-type well) on which the memory cell array is formed.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the erase potential is applied to the control gate lines of the non-selected blocks.
      <br/>
      By keeping this biased state for, e.g., 10 ms, electrons are discharged from the floating gates of all the memory cells in the selected blocks, and the threshold value of each memory cell is changed in the negative-value direction.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      An erase verify operation is then performed to check whether the threshold value of each erased memory cell has become a sufficiently negative value.
      <br/>
      The control gates of the memory cells in all the selected NAND cells are set at 0 V. The selection gates SGS and SGD are set at, e.g., 5 V, and a read potential of, e.g., 1.5 V is applied to the bit lines.
      <br/>
      The source lines and the p-type substrate (or the p-type well) are set at 0 V. At this time, the time during which the selection gates SGS and SGD are kept at 5 V is set such that data "0" can be read out if the threshold value of each erased memory cell becomes a negative value to a certain degree.
      <br/>
      If data "0" cannot be read out within this set time, a data erase operation is performed again, and a verify operation is repeated until the condition is satisfied.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      Subsequently, a data write operation is performed.
      <br/>

      A high potential Vpp is applied to a control gate, and a verify operation is performed upon application of a Vpp pulse.

      The pulse width is a predetermined time  DELTA  t. The values  DELTA  t and  DELTA  Vpp are set such that a maximum change amount  DELTA  Vth of the threshold value of the memory cell in one electron injecting operation becomes equal to the value  DELTA  Vpp.

      When a drain voltage Vd is decreased to 0 V, a control gate voltage Vcg is increased by Vd0, and Vd is increased from Vd0.

      <br/>
      If the bit line BL and the source line are electrically connected to each other after a "0" write operation, it indicates that the threshold value of the selected memory cell is lower than the verify potential, and the "0" write operation is insufficient.

      A p-channel MOS transistor Qp12, an n-channel MOS transistor Qn9, and an n-channel D type MOS transistor QD2 constitute a circuit for setting the node N1 at VGH or VCC.

      When a signal  PHI 4 is set at "H" level, the node N1 is set at VGH.

      When the signal  PHI 4 is set at "L" level, the node N1 is set at VCC.

      The voltage VGH is normally 0 V and is set to be a verify voltage VVRFY (.about 0 (slashed zero) 5 V) in a verify operation.

When the signals  PHI 3 and  PHI 3B are respectively set at "H" level and "L" level, and a node N2 is set at Vpp, the gate of the transistor Qp15 is set at Vpp -2VtP (VtP is the threshold value of the p-channel MOS transistor).

      The voltage Vpp is increased from Vpp1 by VtP every time a write/verify operation is repeated.

      In a write operation, when the signal  PHI 4 is set at "L" level, the node N1 is set at VCC.

      The bit line BL is set at VCC when a "1" write operation is to be performed.

      During the write operation, the selection gate SG2 is kept at 0 V. When the signal  PHI 1 is set at "H" level, the control gates CG1 to CG8, the selection gate SG1, and the bit line BL in which "1" is written are set at VM.

      If it is detected that the threshold value of each memory cell in which "0" is to be written exceeds the verify potential VVRFY, a "1" write operation is performed when a write operation is performed again, thus preventing an excessive "0" write operation.

      If it is detected that the threshold value of each memory cell in which "0" is to be written does not exceed the verify potential VVRFY, a "0" write operation is performed again when a write operation is performed again.

      In the second and subsequent write operations, after the selected control gate CG4 is charged to VM, the signal  PHI 2 is output to quickly charge the selected control gate CG4 to the maximum selected control gate voltage in the previous write operation.

      In addition, the signal  PHI 3 is set at "H" level, so that the selected control gate voltage is controlled/increased by VtP in the time  DELTA  t. For example, in the second write operation, the voltage is controlled/increased from Vpp1 to Vpp2 (Vpp2 =Vpp1 +VtP).

      The value (Vpp1 -VM)/ DELTA  t0 in the first write operation is set to be almost equal to the value VtP / DELTA  t in the second and subsequent write operations.

      These values are set such that the threshold value of the fastest memory cell to write "0" therein is set to be lower than the maximum value of a threshold value distribution, on which the threshold value after the "0" operation should converge, in the first write operation, and the threshold value of each memory cell in which "0" is to be written shifts at a rate of  DELTA  Vpp ( DELTA Vpp is the increase rate of Vpp, which is VtP in this case) in the second and subsequent write operations (FIG. 34).

      FIGS. 35 and 36 show another embodiment of the control gate driver 23B.

      This driver includes first and second first Vpp step-up circuits 47 and 48 for generating outputs respectively denoted by reference symbols VppA and VppB.
      <br/>
      A fourth switching circuit 49 performs control as to whether the output VppA from the first Vpp step-up circuit 47 is connected to a node N1.

      The outputs VppA and VppB are set to be the same voltage Vpp1 in the first write operation; and VppB =VppA + DELTA  Vpp in the second and subsequent write operations.
      <br/>
      Voltages other than VppA and VppB are the same as those shown in FIG. 20. In this embodiment, setting of  DELTA  Vpp is easier than that in the embodiment shown in FIGS. 30 and 31.

      FIGS. 38A and 38B show an electron injection scheme according to the eighth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Three states (data "0", "1", and "2") are stored in one memory cell.
      <br/>
      Although the Vpp pulse waveforms are the same as those shown in FIGS. 25A to 25D, the voltage applied to a memory cell in which "2" is written is different from the voltage applied a memory cell in which "1" is written by  DELTA  VppB.
      <br/>
      In a verify operation, of all the memory cells in which "2" is to be written, memory cells whose threshold values have not reached a desired threshold value (VVRFY2) yet are detected.
      <br/>
      In addition, of all the memory cells in which "1" is to be written, memory cells whose threshold values have not reached a desired threshold value (VVRFY1) yet are detected.
      <br/>
      With respect to only these memories, "2" and "1" write operations are respectively performed again.
      <br/>
      At this time, dVpp2 /dt=dt=dVpp1 /dt= DELTA  VppA is set, and  DELTA  VppA is made equal to a threshold value change amount dVth /dt.
    </p>
    <p num="214">
      With this operation, a threshold value distribution  DELTA  Vth after the "2" and "1" write operations becomes  DELTA  VppA.
      <br/>
      The value  DELTA  VppB is made equal to the value obtained by adding the width  DELTA  Vth of the threshold value distribution to a threshold value margin  DELTA  Vmargin between the threshold value distributions obtained after "2" and "1" write operations ( DELTA  VppB = DELTA  Vth + DELTA  Vmargin or  DELTA  VppB =VVRFY2 -VVRFY1).
      <br/>
      As a result, "2" and "1" write operations are independently and parallelly performed to realize a high-speed read operation.
      <br/>
      As is apparent, the maximum voltage applied to the tunnel oxide film of each memory cell is minimized.
    </p>
    <p num="215">For independent, parallel processing of "2" and "1" write operations and a high-speed write operation, it is effective to set a difference between the voltage applied to a memory cell in which "2" is written and the voltage applied to a memory cell in which "1" is written by  DELTA  VppB regardless of Vpp pulse waveforms.</p>
    <p num="216">
      According to the gist of the above description, the present invention can be equally applied to multivalue (quaternary or more) storage.
      <br/>
      The electron injection scheme has been described with reference to FIGS. 38A and 38B.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention can be equally applied to an electron discharge scheme by inverting the polarity of a control gate relative to a p-type well.
    </p>
    <p num="217">
      The present invention is basically characterized in that an increase in the intensity of an electric field applied to each oxide film portion in which electrons (holes) move under the floating gate owing to the potential Vpp which is gradually increased is canceled by a change in the potential of the floating gate owing to electron (hole) injection or discharge.
      <br/>
      Therefore, according to the gist of the above description, in addition to the scheme of injecting or discharging electrons (holes) by using a tunnel current flowing via the entire channel surface as in the above embodiments, the present invention can be applied to other schemes to obtain the same effects, e.g., a scheme of performing electron injection or discharge by using a tunnel current flowing between a drain or a source and a floating gate and a scheme of using hot electrons or hot holes.
