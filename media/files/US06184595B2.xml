      An interlock for first and second circuit breaker switch mechanisms which respectively have first and second operating handles thereon oriented such that the direction of operation is transverse in relation to the other.
      <br/>
      The interlock includes an interlock mechanism disposed between the first and second switch mechanisms and includes a support, a first interlock member interconnected with the first operating handle, and a second interlock member interconnected with the second operating handle.
      <br/>
      The first and second interlock members are mounted to the support for movement relative to each other along with the respective first and second operating handles.
      <br/>
      The interlock members include interference structure to prevent the second switch mechanism from being in an ON position when the first switch mechanism is in its ON position and likewise to prevent the first switch member from being in an ON position when the second switch member is in its ON position.
      <br/>
      The interlock mechanism allows both switch mechanisms to be in an OFF position simultaneously.
      <br/>
      The interlock mechanism may be used to prevent simultaneous delivery of electrical power from two alternate sources.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention is generally related to an interlock for circuit breaker switches and, more particularly, pertains to a circuit breaker linkage assembly interlocking two opposing circuit breaker handles and preventing both circuit breakers from being ON at the same time.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In today's electrical supply systems, there are occasions when alternate sources of electrical power are necessary or desirable.
      <br/>
      For example, the capability of switching from utility power to emergency generator power is very important for many businesses, hospitals and industries, and is also being employed in residential applications.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In certain applications, it is desirable for separate electrical circuits or even separate groups of electrical circuits to be arranged so that when one group of circuits is switched to a conductive state, another group of circuits is switched to a non-conductive state in alternating fashion.
      <br/>
      In some arrangements, it may be desirable to alternately switch a common load between separate power sources so that, as one power source is disconnected from the load, the second power source is connected to prevent interruption of power to the load.
      <br/>
      In order that the alternate switching may be effective essentially simultaneously, a need has been recognized to employ a coupling mechanism which functions to switch one circuit OFF as the other circuit is switched ON.
      <br/>
      Prior art interlocking systems provide an interlock for first and second aligned circuit breakers having first and second external operating handles oriented thereon such that the operating handles are parallel and disposed away from each other when the switches are OFF, and towards each other when the switches are ON.
      <br/>
      The interlock includes a linkage arrangement disposed across the face of the circuit breaker switches for applying a linear force between the first operating handle and the second operating handle.
      <br/>
      The linkage arrangement is formed such that pushing the first operating handle from an OFF position to an ON position pushes the second operating handle from an ON position to an OFF position.
      <br/>
      An example of an interlock of this type is disclosed in Flegel U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,646 issued Jul. 15, 1997.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The above-described interlock functions satisfactorily for switches which have parallel handles and which move along a common axis between their ON and OFF positions.
      <br/>
      However, it is common to feed utility or primary power to a load center through a main circuit breaker which is oriented perpendicularly to the branch circuit breakers.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, the switch handle of the main circuit breaker moves between its ON and OFF positions in a direction perpendicular to the direction of movement of the branch circuit breaker switch handles.
      <br/>
      This construction prevents use of known prior art interlocks with the main circuit breaker, since known interlocks can only be used with aligned switch handles which move along a common axis.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is thus desirable to provide an interlock mechanism which prevents two circuit breakers in nonparallel relation to each other, and possibly of different sizes, from being turned ON simultaneously.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable that the interlock mechanism permits both of the circuit breakers to be switched OFF at the same time.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a circuit breaker interlock which is useable when the circuit breakers have switches operational in transverse directions.
      <br/>
      A further object of the invention is to provide an interlock that prevents two power sources from supplying power to an electrical panel simultaneously.
      <br/>
      Yet another object of the invention is to provide an interlock that allows the circuit breakers to reside simultaneously in an OFF position so that no power is supplied to the electrical panel.
      <br/>
      Yet another object of the invention is to provide an interlock that is easily adaptable to commonly available circuit breakers and electrical panels.
      <br/>
      Yet another object of the invention is to provide an interlock which is relatively simple in its components and construction, and adaptable to other switching applications.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention advantageously provides an interlock for circuit breakers installed in a standard electrical load center panel for the purpose of providing a safe and simple arrangement for providing power to the selected circuits from an alternate power source, such as a portable generator, during a utility power outage.
      <br/>
      The present invention enables the use of standard, off-the-shelf circuit breakers that, due to differences in size, construction and orientation when installed, cannot be arranged so that their handles more in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In one aspect of the invention, an electrical panel has a first switch mechanism that is movable in a first direction, and a second switch mechanism movable in a second direction, non-parallel to the first direction.
      <br/>
      Both switches are operable between an ON and an OFF position, and are preferably associated with circuit breaker mechanisms which control the supply of electrical power to the electrical panel from a first or second power source, respectively.
      <br/>
      An interlock mechanism is interconnected between the first switch mechanism and the second switch mechanism to prevent movement of the second switch mechanism to an ON position when the first switch mechanism is in its ON position.
      <br/>
      The interlock mechanism also prevents movement of the first switch mechanism to its ON position when the second switch mechanism is in its ON position.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the first and second switch mechanisms include first and second manually operable switch handles, and the interlock mechanism is interconnected between the first and second switch handles.
      <br/>
      In a preferred form, each switch mechanism is adapted for removable mounting to the electrical panel.
      <br/>
      The interlock mechanism includes a support structure adapted for engagement with the first and second switch mechanisms.
      <br/>
      A first interlock member is movably mounted on the support structure, and is engaged with the first switch handle for movement therewith in the first direction.
      <br/>
      A second interlock member is also movably mounted to the support structure, and is engaged with the second switch handle for movement therewith in the second direction.
      <br/>
      The first and second interlock members include interference structure to prevent movement of the second switch member to an ON position when the first switch member is in its ON position, and for preventing the movement of the first switch member to an ON position when the second switch member is in its ON position.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The interference structure of the first and second interlock members preferably includes structure defining a notch.
      <br/>
      The notch is formed in one of the interlock members, hereafter referred to as the notched interlock member, and extends in a direction transverse to the direction of movement of the notched interlock member.
      <br/>
      The other interlock member is preferably in the form of an engagement interlock member having corresponding interference structure adapted to be selectively received within the notch.
      <br/>
      When the first switch member, to which the notched interlock member is mounted, is moved to its OFF position, the notch is aligned with the interference structure of the engagement interlock member.
      <br/>
      This enables movement of the second switch member, to which the engagement interlock member is mounted, to its ON position.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the notched interlock member defines an interference surface adjacent the notch which is in alignment with the interference structure of the engagement interlock member.
      <br/>
      Movement of the second switch member to its ON position is prevented by the interference structure when the first switch member, to which the notched interlock member is mounted, is in its ON position.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The support structure preferably includes a support plate configured to engage a shoulder defmed by each of the first and second switch mechanisms adjacent to the first and second switch members, respectively.
      <br/>
      A post member is engaged with and extends from the support plate, and the first and second interlock members each include a slot extending in the direction of its movement.
      <br/>
      The post member is received within the slots for providing movement of the first and second interlock members relative to the support plate.
      <br/>
      Each interlock member is preferably formed of a planar member slidably mounted to the support plate for movement relative to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Another aspect of the invention involves an improvement in an electrical panel including a first switch mechanism having a first switch member or handle movable in a first direction between an ON and an OFF position for controlling the supply of electrical power from a first source.
      <br/>
      The improvement contemplates a second switch mechanism having a second switch member or handle movable in a second direction, transverse to the first direction, for controlling the supply of power from a second power source, and an interlock mechanism for controlling movement of the first and second switch members or handles.
      <br/>
      Details of this aspect of the invention are substantially as summarized above.
    </p>
    <p num="12">The invention further contemplates a method of preventing movement of a first switch mechanism to an ON position when an adjacent second interlock mechanism is in an ON position, substantially in accordance with the foregoing summary.</p>
    <p num="13">Various other features, objects and advantages of the invention will be made apparent from the following description taken together with the drawings.</p>

    <p num="39">
      In operation, interlock mechanism 12 functions as follows to prevent primary and secondary switch handles 26 and 30 from being in the ON position at the same time.
      <br/>
      With reference to FIG. 8, switch handles 26 and 30 are both illustrated as being in the OFF position.
      <br/>
      In this position, recess 112 in notched interlock member 38 is in axial alignment with engagement member 152 of engagement interlock member 40, such that secondary switch handle 30 can be moved to its ON position as shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      When secondary switch handle 30 is moved to its ON position in this manner, movement of engagement interlock member 40 is enabled by the provision of slot 142 in base 138 of engagement interlock member 40, and engagement member 152 is received within recess 112 of notched interlock member 38.
      <br/>
      With secondary switch handle 30 in its ON position of FIG. 9, engagement member 152 is located in close proximity to side edge 116 of recess 112 in notched interlock member 38.
      <br/>
      Movement of primary switch handle 26 away from its OFF position is prevented by engagement of side edge 116 with engagement member 152, such that primary switch handle 26 cannot be moved to its ON position.
      <br/>
      Engagement member 152 thus defines interference structure in the path of movement of notched interlock member 38 and its associated recess 112, to prevent movement of primary switch handle 16 to its ON position as long as secondary switch handle 26 is in its ON position.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      When it is desired to move primary switch handle 26 to its ON position, secondary switch handle 30 must first be moved to its OFF position as shown in FIG. 8, which moves engagement member 152 out of recess 112 in notched interlock member 38.
      <br/>
      Such movement of engagement member 152 out of recess 112 enables movement of notched interlock member 38 along with primary switch handle 26 to its ON position, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Movement of notched interlock member 38 along with primary switch handle 26 is enabled by the provision of slot 120 in notched interlock member 38, and results in the positioning of end edge outer section 110 of notched interlock member 38 in alignment with engagement member 152.
      <br/>
      End edge outer section 110 thus defines interference structure in the path of movement of engagement member 152, to prevent movement of secondary switch handle 30 to its ON position as long as primary switch handle 26 is in its ON position.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      It can thus be appreciated that interlock mechanism 12 provides a simple and efficient mechanism for preventing two switches which are movable in perpendicular directions from being in an ON position at the same time.
      <br/>
      The components of interlock mechanism 12 are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and assemble, and take advantage of the existing switch body and handle structure to secure the components of interlock mechanism 12 to each other and to the switches.
      <br/>
      Interlock mechanism 12 can either be installed during original assembly of electrical panel assembly 10 or can be retrofit after assembly if an existing electrical panel is being outfitted with a secondary source of power.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      While interlock mechanism 12 has been shown and described with respect to switch handles which move in a direction perpendicular to each other, it is understood that interlock mechanism 12 can be easily adapted to accommodate arrangements in which the direction of movement of the switch handles includes any transverse component, i.e. when the switch handles do not move along the same or parallel axes.
      <br/>
      Further, while interlock mechanism 12 has been shown and described with respect to an electrical panel assembly, it should be understood that interlock mechanism 12 could be used in any other application in which it is desired to interlock two switches or switch handles which are oriented relative to each other such that movement of the switch handles is non-parallel.
