      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to a portable power operated surface preparation device and more particularly to an adapter having a surface treating disk attached to one end and a power unit attached to the other end.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Power tools for sanding, grinding or buffing are well-known in the art.
      <br/>
      When a sanding pad is attached to a disk of power sander or grinder, there is a tendency for the tool to walk away from the operator requiring extra effort by the operator to keep the tool touching a particular area until the operator decides to move the tool to another area.
      <br/>
      This results in the operator tiring quicker compared to an operator only providing force to guide the power tool from one area to another.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In U.S. Pat. 1,653,108 issued Dec. 20, 1927 to Otto A. Koenig a power operated surface machine is described which is hand manipulated and by which the surfacing is accomplished with a rotary motion or a rotary motion plus a reciprocatory motion hand applied.
      <br/>
      The machine comprises a housing which is cup-shaped opened at the lower end.
      <br/>
      A shaft runs through the center of the cup and has a hollow lower end for housing a central cushion spring.
      <br/>
      A flange abutment plate is secured under the shaft section and a larger cushion spring encircling the shaft.
      <br/>
      The central spring serves to exert downward pressure at the center of a flexible disk attached to the bottom of the shaft and the cushion spring exerts pressure on the peripheral portions of the flexible disk.
      <br/>
      These two springs provide surface conforming contact of the disk with the surface being worked on.
      <br/>
      However, the disk is rotated at only 1800 RPM.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In U.S. Pat. 1,643,882 issued Sep. 27, 1927 to M. A. Faireo, a meat block cleaver is described comprising an electric motor in a housing with a lower member and cleaning brush attached to the housing by compression springs which encircle 4 bolts equally spaced and extend through a circular plate.
      <br/>
      An operator moves the device across the surface of the meat block to be scraped and cleaned.
      <br/>
      Typically two hands are required by the operator to control this power tool.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In U.S. Pat. 1,681,648 issued Aug. 21, 1928 to Chandler S. Root a rubbing machine is described for polishing automobile bodies and woodwork of various kinds.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIG. 1 a perspective view of a portable power unit 10 is shown comprising the invention of an adapter 18.
      <br/>
      A first end attaches to a threaded shaft 13 extending from and driven by an electric motor 12.
      <br/>
      A disk 16 having a threaded stud 17 attaches to the second end of the adapter 18.
      <br/>
      Attached to the underside of disk 16 is sandpaper or other material 19 depending on a user's application.
      <br/>
      For example, in polishing applications a soft cloth material is provided on the disk 16.
      <br/>
      Although the adapter 18 is shown in FIG. 1 attached to the motor 12 of the portable power unit 10, the adapter 18 may be attached to a motor on a floor sander carriage (not shown) and obtain improved performance as with the portable hand power unit 10.
      <br/>
      An operator only has to provide force to guide the portable power unit 10 from one area to another, and not provide force, as needed with prior art portable power units, to keep the tool end touching a particular work area when using with the adapter 18.
      <br/>
      The adapter 18 may be operated by the electric motor 12 at speeds up to 10,000 RPMs.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Referring to FIG. 1. and FIG. 2., FIG. 2 shows a side elevational view of the spring 22 of FIG. 1 prior to insertion in caps 14 and 20.
      <br/>
      The adapter 18 comprises an upper cap 14, a lower cap 20 and a spring 22.
      <br/>
      One end of spring 22 is secured within the upper cap 14 and the other end of spring 22 is secured within the lower cap 20.
      <br/>
      The upper cap 14 and lower cap 20 are made by injection molding of plastic which is well known to those skilled in the art, and the spring 22 is made of 1/8 inch stainless steel.
      <br/>
      Other size springs may be used depending on the application requirement.
      <br/>
      The caps 14 and 20 with an end of the spring 22 secured in each cap may be fabricated by less automated techniques well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      The distance between upper cap 14 and lower cap 20 is typically approximately 3/8 inches.
      <br/>
      This spacing allows for approximately a twenty degree tilt angle by upper cap 18 relative to lower cap 20 while the lower cap 20 remains flush on the surface being worked on.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring now to FIG. 3. and FIG. 4, FIG. 3 is a cut away perspective view of the upper cap 14 showing a 5/16 inch threaded wing nut 24 embedded in the upper surface of cap 14.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 is a cut away perspective view of the lower cap 14 showing a 5/16 inch threaded wing nut 25 embedded in the lower surface of cap 20.
      <br/>
      Other size nuts may be equally applicable depending on the size of the motor shaft 13 and disk stud 17.
      <br/>
      The upper cap 14 receives the threaded shaft 13 from the motor 12 and the lower cap 20 receives the threaded shaft 17 from the disk 16.
      <br/>
      The size of the threaded nuts 24, 25 may vary depending on the particular brand of motor 12 or disk 16 used with the adapter 18.
      <br/>
      The upper cap 14 and the lower cap 20 are filled with an epoxy material 28, 30 which may be embodied by epoxy or body filter made by Dynatron Bondo Company of Atlanta, Georgia.
      <br/>
      The epoxy holds the wing nuts in the center of the outer surface of each cup 14, 20.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Referring now to FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B, FIG. 5A is a side elevational view of the power unit 10 with the adapter 18 attached showing the upper cap 14 and the lower cap 20 parallel to each other when the power unit shaft 13 is perpendicular to the disk 16.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5B is a side elevational view of the power unit 10 with the adapter 18 attached showing the position of the power unit upper cap 14 tilted with respect to the lower cap 20 and the disk 16 which are flush and parallel to the surface 21 during operation.
      <br/>
      This is a significant feature of the invention.
      <br/>
      When the disk 16 is placed in contact with a surface being operated on, whether sanding, grinding or buffing, the disk tends to remain stationary until an operator moves the power unit to another area.
      <br/>
      The power unit is not pulled away by centrifugal force as has been so common with the prior art.
      <br/>
      This feature is particularly useful when working on curved objects.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Referring now to FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, FIG. 6 shows a perspective view of an alternate embodiment of the invention comprising an adapter 30.
      <br/>
      The adapter 30 includes upper cap 32 and lower cap 34 interconnected by four equally spaced springs 36, 38, 40, 42.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6. shows one of the springs 38 prior to being embedded in caps 32, 34 which may be embodied by a commonly available spring with Part No. 181 obtainable at Sears Hardware Stores.
      <br/>
      The adapter 30 may be operated with a motor 12 at speeds up to 3,600 RPMs.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring again to FIG. 1, the motor 12 may be embodied by a motorized hand tool such as Model No. 900.277230, manufactured by Sears, Roebuck and Co. of Hoffman Estates, Ill.
      <br/>
      The spring 22 may be embodied by Part No. 407 manufactured by Spring Mfg.
      <br/>
      Co. of Tewksbury, Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
