    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention comprises a DNA sequence that encodes deacetoxycephalosporin C synthetase and deacetylcephalosporin C synthetase activities.
      <br/>
      Deacetoxycephalosporin C synthetase (DAOCS) catalyzes the reaction in which deacetoxycephalosporin C (DAOC) is formed from penicillin N and is often referred to as expandase.
      <br/>
      Deacetylcephalosporin C synthetase (DACS) catalyzes the formation of deacetylcephalosporin C (DAC) from DAOC, a hydroxylation reaction.
      <br/>
      These reactions are critical steps in the biosynthesis of important antibiotics, such as cephalosporins from Cephalosporium acremonium and 7 ALPHA -methoxycephalosporins from Streptomyces clavuligerus.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The DNA compounds of the present invention encode the DAOCS and DACS in a single open reading frame.
      <br/>
      Transcription of this open reading frame, followed by translation of the resulting mRNA, yields a single polypeptide chain that possesses both DAOCS and DACS activities.
      <br/>
      Because of this dual nature of the compounds of the present invention, the terms "DAOCS/DACS," "DACS/DAOCS," "expandase/hydroxylase," and "EXP/HYD" are used to denote that a given gene, coding sequence, and enzyme possesses both DACS and DAOCS attributes.
      <br/>
      The linkage of these activities is not universally observed; for example, cephamycin-producing species of Streptomyces utilize two different polypeptides to express the DAOCS and DACS activities.
      <br/>
      Although concomitant expression of the DAOCS and DACS activities is convenient, and usually most preferred, it is not a critical aspect of the invention.
      <br/>
      Genetic engineering techniques, as exemplified herein, provide a ready means to separate the genetic information encoding DAOCS from DACS and so separately express either the DAOCS or DACS activity.
      <br/>
      Thus, the dual nature of the illustrative compounds, vectors, and enzymatic activities of the invention is not a limitation, for the invention also comprises single nature molecules: those that demonstrate only DACS or DAOCS attributes.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The DNA compound that encodes the DACS/DAOCS activities was isolated from Cephalosporium acremonium genomic DNA and used to construct recombinant DNA expression vectors.
      <br/>
      Three types of these expression vectors are especially useful: the first drives high-level expression of the DAOCS/DACS activities in E. coli; the second in C. acremonium; and the third in Penicillium chrysogenum.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The E. coli-produced DAOCS/DACS activities catalyze the formation of DAOC from penicillin N and DAC from DAOC.
      <br/>
      Crude cell extracts of these E. coli transformants of the invention exhibited DAOCS/DACS activities without any prior activation treatment.
      <br/>
      These E. coli expression vectors and transformants provide an efficient means for obtaining large amounts of active DAOCS/DACS enzyme.
      <br/>
      The DAOCS/DACS enzyme is useful not only for the production of DAOC and DAC but also for the expansion of penicillins other than penicillin N and hydroxylation of cephalosporins other than DAOC to form novel antibiotics.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The Cephalosporium vectors of the present invention are useful for purposes of constructing strains for use by the pharmaceutical industry.
      <br/>
      Cephalosporium is an economically important organism used to produce penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics.
      <br/>
      Transformation of Cephalosporium with the expression vectors of this invention results in higher intracellular levels of DAOCS and DACS in the transformants.
      <br/>
      These transformants can be used to increase the efficiency of, and yield of antibiotic in, industrial fermentation.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The Penicillium vectors of the present invention are most useful to introduce cephalosporin synthesizing activities into high-level penicillin producing Penicillium strains.
      <br/>
      The DAOCS activity is useful for conversion of the various penicillins to cephalosporins, either alone or in conjunction with other activities, such as DACS or epimerase.
      <br/>
      For example, concomitant expression of isopenicillin N epimerase activity (from, e.g., Cephalosporium acremonium) and DAOCS activity in Penicillium leads to production of DAOC, a heretofore unknown metabolite in Penicillium.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention also provides an improved method for introducing recombinant DNA molecules to Penicillium species.
      <br/>
      This novel transformation system utilizes the amdS gene of Aspergillus nidulans.
      <br/>
      Using acetamide (CH3 CONH2) as the sole carbon or nitrogen source on transformation plates, one can select Penicillium host cells transformed with a vector containing the amdS gene from their untransformed counter-parts, which are unable to grow on the plates because wild-type Penicillium express no acetamidase activity.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The DNA compounds encoding DAOCS/DACS are readily modified to construct expression vectors that increase the efficiency and yield of fermentations involving other organisms, such as Paecilomyces and Streptomyces, especially S. clavuligerus.
      <br/>
      Although the DACS/DAOCS-encoding DNA of the present invention was isolated from Cephalosporium acremonium, this DNA can be used to construct vectors that drive expression of DACS/DAOCS in a wide variety of host cells, as illustrated by the E. coli expression vectors described above.
      <br/>
      The construction protocols utilized for the E. coli, Cephalosporium, and Penicillium vectors of the invention can be followed to construct analogous vectors for other organisms, merely by substituting, if necessary, the appropriate regulatory elements.
      <br/>
      Most organisms that produce penicillins and cephalosporins utilize the common precursor penicillin N, a substrate for DAOCS.
      <br/>
      The DACS/DAOCS-encoding DNA compounds of the present invention can be used to construct expression vectors useful for improving the efficiency and yield of fermentations involving a wide variety of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotic-producing organisms.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The DNA compounds of the present invention are derived from genomic DNA of Cephalosporium acremonium and are significantly homologous in nucleotide sequence to the DNA compounds encoding DAOCS and/or DACS activity in other cephalosporin-producing organisms, such as Streptomyces clavuligerus.
      <br/>
      Because of this homology, the DACS/DAOCS-encoding DNA compounds of the present invention can be labelled and used to screen genomic libraries of organisms that produce cephalosporin C or similar compounds for the presence of either DACS or DAOCS-encoding DNA.
      <br/>
      Many organisms comprise DACS/DAOCS activity-encoding DNA that can be identified and isolated using the DNA compounds of the present invention, and the present invention comprises these equivalent, homologous DNA compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The DACS/DAOCS-encoding DNA compounds of the present invention were isolated in conjunction with the regulatory sequences that control transcription and, ultimately, expression of the Cephalosporium acremonium DAOCS/DACS activities.
      <br/>
      The present invention comprises these novel regulatory sequences, which can be used, as disclosed herein, to drive transcription, translation, and expression of any gene product in Cephalosporium.
      <br/>
      These regulatory sequences are especially preferred for use in C. acremonium.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The present invention also comprises the regulatory signals of the DACS/DAOCS gene located at the 3' end of the coding strand of the coding region of the Cephalosporium acremonium DACS/DAOCS gene.
      <br/>
      These 3' regulatory sequences encode the transcription termination and mRNA polyadenylation and processing signals of the DACS/DAOCS gene.
      <br/>
      Placing these signals at the 3' end of the coding strand of the coding region of the gene to be expressed enhances expression of the desired gene product in Cephalosporium.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="78">
      The present invention comprises DNA compounds and recombinant DNA cloning and expression vectors that encode DAOCS and DACS activity.
      <br/>
      These compounds provide for the expression of a single protein that expresses both activities or for a protein that expresses only one of the two activities.

      The DNA sequence shown above is .about.63% in G and C content and encodes a polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 36,462 daltons and an observed molecular weight of about 40,000 daltons.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that the DNA sequence depicted above is an important part of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The above sequence can be conventionally synthesized by the modified phosphotriester method using fully protected deoxyribonucleotide building blocks.
      <br/>
      Such synthetic methods are well known in the art and can be carried out in substantial accordance with the procedure of Itakura et al., 1977, Science 198:1056 and Crea et al., 1978, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 75:5765.
      <br/>
      In addition, an especially preferred method is disclosed in Hsiung et al., 1983, Nucleic Acid Research 11:3227 and Narang et al., 1980, Methods in Enzymology 68:90.
      <br/>
      In addition to the manual procedures referenced above, the DNA sequence can be synthesized using automated DNA synthesizers, such as the Systec 1450A or ABS (Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, Calif. 94404) 380A DNA Synthesizers.

      Due to the degenerate nature of the genetic code, which results from there being more than one codon for most of the amino acid residues and translation stop signal, the amino acid residue sequence of DACS/DAOCS enzyme depicted above can be encoded by a multitude of different DNA sequences.
      <br/>
      Because these alternate DNA sequences would encode the same amino acid residue sequence of the present invention, the present invention further comprises these alternate sequences.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Due to the diverse number of Cephalosporium species and even of different strains within the same species there are genetic variants of the DACS/DAOCS-encoding DNA of the present invention.
      <br/>
      These genetic variants share substantial DNA and amino acid residue sequence homology with the compounds of the present invention and encode proteins with similar, if not for all practical purposes identical, activity, but differ somewhat from the actual compounds of the present invention.
      <br/>
      These genetic variants are also equivalent to the compounds of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      The DACS/DAOCS activity-encoding DNA compounds of the present invention were isolated from a strain of Cephalosporium acremonium commonly known as the Brotzu strain that is available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md., under the accession number ATCC 11550.
      <br/>
      A genomic library of the total genomic DNA of the Brotzu strain was constructed in the bifunctional cosmid vector pKC462A (available in E. coli K12 SF8 under NRRL B-15973) and examined for the presence of sequences homologous to a set of 32 different deoxyribooligonucleotides.
      <br/>
      This set of 32 different deoxyribooligonucleotides was constructed in accordance with information obtained from a partial amino acid sequence of the C. acremonium DACS/DAOCS enzyme and knowledge of the genetic code.
      <br/>
      A variety of vectors were identified that were homologous to one or more of the 32 different deoxyribooligonucleotides.
      <br/>
      DNA sequencing revealed which vectors encoded the C. acremonium DACS/DAOCS enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      After the vectors that encoded the DACS/DAOCS enzyme were identified, an .about.7.0 kb BamHI restriction fragment comprising the DACS/DAOCS gene was isolated and inserted into commercially available plasmid pUC8 to yield plasmid pIT503, which was then transformed into E. coli K12 JA221 host cells.
      <br/>
      The E. coli K12 JA221/pIT503 transformants have been deposited and made part of the stock culture collection of the Northern Regional Research Laboratories (NRRL), Peoria, Ill. 61604, under the accession number NRRL B-18170.

      Plasmid pIT503 can be isolated from E. coli K12 JA221 by the procedure described in Example 1 and used to construct the E. coli DACS/DAOCS expression vectors of the invention.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pIT503 was used as starting material to construct plasmid pIT507, which drives high-level expression of DACS/DAOCS activity in E. coli.
      <br/>
      The construction protocol for plasmid pIT507 is presented in Example 2 (see 2K) and involves ligating the .about.2.2 kb SstI-BamHI, DACS/DAOCS-encoding restriction fragment of plasmid pIT503 to the .about.5.8 kb NdeI-BamHI fragment of pCZR336 and an .about.60 bp SstI-NdeI synthetic fragment.

      Plasmid pCZR336 comprises a  LAMBDA pL-derived promoter, translational activating sequence, the  LAMBDA pL operator encoded by the c1857 repressor gene, a first "cistron" encoding a small peptide that precedes the gene of interest, and a DNA sequence encoding an hGH derivative.
      <br/>
      At low temperatures of about 30 (degree)  C., the cI857 protein encoded on plasmids pCZR336 and pIT507 is active and able to repress activity of the  LAMBDA pL promoter, but when the temperature is raised to about 42 (degree)  C., the cI857 protein is inactivated, and the  LAMBDA pL promoter drives transcription of large amounts of mRNA encoding hGH (pCZR336) or DACS/DAOCS (pIT507).

      <br/>
      The .about.2.2 kb SstI-BamHI restriction fragment of plasmid pIT503 comprises the majority of the coding sequence for DACS/DAOCS, and the remainder of the coding sequence is contained on an .about.60 bp NdeI-SstI synthetic fragment, with slight modifications from the wild-type DNA sequence to facilitate future work.

      At temperatures of about 42 (degree)  C., E. coli K12 JM109/pIT507 express DACS/DAOCS activity at high levels, approaching .about.15% of the total cell protein.
      <br/>
      Crude cell extracts from these E. coli K12 JM109/pIT507 transformants are able to catalyze the conversion of penicillin N into DAOC and DAC, whereas cell extracts from non-transformed E. coli K12 JM109 cells cannot catalyze this conversion.

      The method of assay and results of the assay for the conversion reaction are presented in Example 3.

      Many E. coli K12 strains contain an endogenous penicillinase activity, probably encoded by the ampC locus.
      <br/>
      For this reason it is desirable to effect a partial purification of the DAOCS/DACS polypeptide so that optimal DAOCS/DACS activity is observed.
      <br/>
      For these purposes, purification of the enzyme through DEAE-Trisacryl is sufficient to separate the endogenous E. coli penicillinase activity from the desired DAOCS/DACS activity.
      <br/>
      An example of this type of partial purification is summarized below in Example 3.
      <br/>
      An alternative to the use of partial purification to overcome the deleterious effects of the penicillinase is to use a strain defective in the production of this activity.

      One such strain, E. coli K12 A85892, is available from the Northern Regional Research Center under the accession number NRRL B-18096.

      Plasmids pIT507 and pIT511 (described below) provide an efficient means of producing large amounts of DACS/DAOCS in E. coli.
      <br/>
      Because E. coli/pIT507 express DACS/DAOCS at levels approaching 15% of total cell protein, and because culturing E. coli is less complex than culturing organisms that naturally produce DAOCS and/or DACS, E. coli/pIT507 transformants can be used to produce recombinant DACS/DAOCS more efficiently and economically than non-recombinant or "natural" DACS/DAOCS producers.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      DAOCS can be used to produce DAOC from penicillin N in a cell-free system as described in Example 3.
      <br/>
      DAOC is not only a useful antibiotic, but also can be used as the starting material for the production of such important antibiotics as cephalexin and other cephalosporins (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,307,192).
      <br/>
      Perhaps the most important use of DACS/DAOCS is the use of the enzyme to transform penicillins other than penicillin N into novel cephalosporin derivatives.

    <p num="97">
      Cell-free extracts of penicillin and cephalosporin-producing organisms can be used to synthesize unnatural (not produced in nature)  BETA -lactams.
      <br/>
      The E. coli expression vectors of the present invention provide an inexpensive and efficient method of obtaining DACS/DAOCS, which can be used in vitro to transform penicillins that do not naturally occur in nature to form novel antibiotics or antibiotic core structures.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Plasmid pIT507 is especially preferred for driving expression of DACS/DAOCS in E. coli not only because of the high expression levels achieved when using the plasmid but also because of the selectable marker present on the plasmid.
      <br/>
      Many recombinant DNA vectors encode a  BETA -lactamase, so that cells containing the vector can grow in the presence of certain  BETA -lactam antibiotics, such as ampicillin.
      <br/>
      However, if one desires to use a cell-free extract containing DACS/DAOCS for purposes of constructing  BETA -lactams, one does not want the extract to contain  BETA -lactamase activity.
      <br/>
      Thus, plasmid pIT507 does not encode a  BETA -lactamase for a selectable marker but rather employs a tetracycline resistance-conferring gene, which encodes a protein that does not react with  BETA -lactams.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      The DACS/DAOCS expression vectors of the present invention are not limited to a particular selectable marker.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art recognize that many selectable markers are suitable for use on DACS/DAOCS expression vectors.
      <br/>
      Such selectable markers include genes that confer kanamycin resistance, genes that confer chloramphenicol resistance, or other antibiotic resistance-conferring genes.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      The search for unnatural penicillins that will serve as substrates for DACS/DAOCS can be complemented by a search for mutant DACS/DAOCS enzymes that will accept penicillins other than penicillin N as substrate.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides the starting material for such a search for a mutant DACS/DAOCS and comprises DNA compounds derived through mutagenesis of a DACS/DAOCS coding sequence. E. coli is the best host for mutational cloning experiments, and the E. coli expression vectors of the present invention can be readily mutated by procedures well known in the art, such as, for example, treatment with radiation (X-ray or UV) or chemical mutagens (such as ethylmethanesulfonate, nitrosoguanidine, or methyl methanesulfonate) or site-specific mutagenesis, to obtain mutant enzymes that recognize unnatural penicillins as substrate and catalyze the conversion of those unusual and/or unnatural penicillins to unnatural cephalosporins.

    <p num="101">
      Example 4 describes the construction protocol for another expression vector, designated pIT511, identical to plasmid pIT507 except that all but about 120 bp of 3' noncoding (downstream of the translation termination signal) information has been eliminated from the expression vector.
      <br/>
      This vector is a superior starting material for mutagenesis work because the DACS/DAOCS coding region is a larger percentage of the total vector.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      As those skilled in the art will recognize, the present invention allows one to change the codons for the DACS/DAOCS gene at will.
      <br/>
      Given the DNA sequence for the DACS/DAOCS gene, only routine procedures are required to generate mutant DACS/DAOCS enzymes that vary from the natural DACS/DAOCS enzyme at any number of amino-acid residue positions.
      <br/>
      Such mutant enzymes would be encoded by mutant DACS/DAOCS coding sequences, including sequences in which amino-acid codons have been deleted from or inserted into the natural DACS/DAOCS coding sequence.
      <br/>
      Such mutant DACS/DAOCS enzymes are within the scope of the present invention, because even if one cannot absolutely predict whether a given mutation will destroy activity of the encoded DACS/DAOCS, one need merely express the mutant sequence, as exemplified herein, to ascertain the effect on DACS/DAOCS activity.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Examples of production of mutant forms of DACS/DAOCS are given in Examples 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      Example 5 describes a deletion of the coding information for 10 amino acids from near the amino terminus of the DACS/DAOCS by deletion of the corresponding 30 bp in the coding sequence and the expression of the mutant polypeptide in E. coli.
      <br/>
      This mutant DACS/DAOCS is expressed from plasmid pIT512, as exemplified by E. coli K12 JM109/pIT512 transformants.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      Besides alteration of the amount of genetic information (thereby causing insertion or deletion of amino acids in the resulting protein) the specific DNA sequence can be altered, thereby altering the encoded amino acid sequence.
      <br/>
      One way of accomplishing this site-directed mutagenesis is described in Example 6.
      <br/>
      The DACS/DAOCS protein contains a cysteine residue at position 100; Example 6 describes a procedure for changing this residue to a serine in the DACS/DAOCS coding region of the expression vector plasmid pIT513.
      <br/>
      This general method can be used to change any residue to any of the other 19 naturally-encoded amino acids.
      <br/>
      In vitro splicing of mutant genes created by such a method allows production of proteins with combinations of mutations.

    <p num="105">
      The present invention is not limited to the particular vectors exemplified herein.
      <br/>
      Instead, the present invention comprises DNA compounds that encode any DAOCS and/or DACS activity.
      <br/>
      The DNA compounds of the present invention can be used to construct expression vectors that drive expression of DACS/DAOCS activity in any host cell in which the expression vector replicates or integrates and in which the promoter and translational activating sequence used to express the DACS/DAOCS activity functions.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      Therefore, although the E. coli expression vectors exemplified herein utilize a two cistron construction whose transcription is driven by  LAMBDA pL in E. coli, the present invention comprises any E. coli expression plasmid or vector that drives expression of DACS/DAOCS in E. coli.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention comprises expression vectors that drive expression of DACS/DAOCS and utilize a replicon functional in E. coli, such as, for example, a replicon from such plasmids as pBR322, pACYC184, F, ColV-K94, R1, R6-5, or R100.
      <br/>
      Nor is the present invention solely limited to plasmid vectors, for the present invention also comprises expression vectors that express DACS/DAOCS activity and utilize integration or viral replication to provide for replication and maintenance in the host cell.

      The present invention is not limited to a particular promoter and translational activating sequence to drive expression of the DACS/DAOCS synthetase activity-encoding DNA.
      <br/>
      The present invention comprises the use of any promoter and translational activating sequence that functions in E. coli and is used to express DACS/DAOCS in E. coli.
      <br/>
      Many promoter and translational activating sequences functional in E. coli are known and are suitable for driving expression of DACS/DAOCS activity in E. coli.
      <br/>
      Such transcriptional and translational activating sequences include, but are not limited to, the lpp, lac, trp, tac,  LAMBDA pL, and  LAMBDA pR promoter and translational activating sequences.

    <p num="108">
      In addition to the various E. coli transcriptional and translational activating sequences exemplified above, transcriptional and translational activating sequences from other organisms can be ligated to the present DAOC synthetase-encoding DNA compounds to form expression vectors that drive expression of DAOC synthetase activity in host cells in which the activating sequence functions.
      <br/>
      Although E. coli is the host best suited for DACS/DAOCS production and subsequent purification for in vitro use, vectors that drive expression of DAOC synthetase activity in host cells other than E. coli are also useful, especially for purposes of increasing the cephalosporin antibiotic-producing ability and efficiency of a given organism.

      Plasmid pPS56 is a Cephalosporium expression vector of the invention.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS55 (FIG. 25) is an intermediate in the construction of plasmid pPS56 (FIG. 26).
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS55 is constructed from the HindIII backbone of plasmid pMLC12 (FIG. 19) and the .about.2.3 kb HindIII fragment from plasmid pPS34 (FIG. 20) that contains the C. acremonium IPS promoter fused to the hygromycin B phosphotransferase coding sequence (see Example 7).
      <br/>
      The .about.7 kb, DACS/DAOCS gene-containing, BamHI fragment from plasmid pIT503 (FIG. 1) is fused to partially BamHI-digested plasmid pPS55 to yield plasmid pPS56 as described in Example 7B.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      The Cephalosporium acremonium promoter and translational activating sequence encoded on plasmid pIT503 is correctly positioned to drive expression of the DACS/DAOCS synthetase activity-encoding DNA, because in the construction of plasmid pIT503 no deletions or insertions affecting the promoter and translational activating sequence were introduced in the DNA flanking the 5' end of the coding strand of the DACS/DAOCS activity-encoding DNA.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pIT503 and derivatives that contain the intact DACS/DAOCS gene can therefore be used to increase the antibiotic-producing ability and efficiency of Cephalosporium and related host cells in which the C. acremonium promoter and translational activating sequence functions.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS56 is preferred for this purpose, but plasmids pIT503 and pPS52 can also be used.
      <br/>
      This increased antibiotic-producing ability and efficiency results from increased levels of DACS/DAOCS activity, which in turn results from the presence of additional, expressed copies of the DACS/DAOCS gene.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS56 also comprises a hygromycin resistance-conferring gene that functions in C. acremonium and allows for selection of C. acremonium/pPS56 transformants.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      Once the Cephalosporium acremonium/pPS56 transformants are selected (Example 21), however, there is no need to maintain the pressure of selection, hygromycin B, in the growth medium.
      <br/>
      Selective pressure is not required, because the C. acremonium/pPS56 transformants are very stable.
      <br/>
      This stability is believed to result from the plasmid pPS56 transforming C. acremonium via chromosomal integration.
      <br/>
      The present invention, however, is not limited to plasmids that drive expression of DACS/DAOCS synthetase activity in C. acremonium and transform via chromosomal integration but also includes extrachromosomally replicating DACS/DAOCS expression vectors (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,492,758).
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      The promoter of the Cephalosporium acremonium DACS/DAOCS might also function in Penicillium (see the discussion of plasmid pPS52 below), but the optimal Penicillium expression vectors utilize a promoter derived from a Penicillium gene.
      <br/>
      The Penicillium IPS promoter from plasmid pLC1 (NRRL B-18181 and FIG. 33) is linked with the backbone of plasmid pMLC12 with the aid of a synthetic linker to produce plasmid pPS53 (FIG. 23), as described in Example 10.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS53 is an intermediate in the construction of several other cloning vectors and expression plasmids (FIG. 34).
      <br/>
      The .about.1.0 kb, promoter-containing BamHI fragment of plasmid pPS53 is fused with the .about.4.3 kb BamHI, HmR coding sequence-containing fragment of plasmid pPS55 to create plasmid pPS57 (FIG. 27), as described in Example 12.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      Plasmid pPS57 is an intermediate in the construction of Penicillium expression vector pPS62 (FIG. 34).
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS62 contains a selectable marker (HmR) and a hybrid DACS/DAOCS gene, with both the DACS/DAOCS and HmR coding sequences under the control of the promoter (2 copies) of the Penicillium IPS gene.
      <br/>
      The construction protocol for plasmid pPS62 is described in further detail below (see also Example 17).
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      A Penicillium DACS/DAOCS expression vector without a selectable marker was constructed by inserting the .about.1.0 kb BamHI, promoter-containing fragment of plasmid pPS53 into the BglII site of E. coli DACS/DAOCS expression vector pIT511 to yield plasmid pPS60 (FIG. 30), as described in Example 13.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS60 contains the Penicillium IPS promoter near, but not positioned optimally for expression of the DACS/DAOCS coding sequence.
      <br/>
      The proper alignment is achieved by first deleting two small XbaI restriction fragments from plasmid pPS60, creating plasmid pPS58 (FIG. 28), as described in Example 14.
      <br/>
      Then a synthetic linker is inserted into the XbaI site to create a more preferred alignment of the Penicillium IPS promoter and DACS/DAOCS coding sequence to yield plasmid pPS59, as described in Example 15.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS59 is useful for expressing DACS/DAOCS activity in cells in Penicillium and other cells in which the Penicillium IPS promoter functions.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      Plasmid pPS59 is also an intermediate for illustrative Penicillium DACS/DAOCS expression vectors pPS62 and pPS61.
      <br/>
      In both cases, an .about.2.1 kb BamHI-NruI restriction fragment from plasmid pPS59, made blunt-ended with Klenow enzyme, is used as a source of the DACS/DAOCS coding sequence fused to the Penicillium IPS promoter.
      <br/>
      Plasmids pPS61 and pPS62 both contain selectable markers for Penicillium.
      <br/>
      Example 17 describes the fusion of the .about.2.13 kb fragment of plasmid pPS59 with the HindIII-cleaved, Klenow-treated backbone of plasmid pPS57 to create plasmid pPS62 (FIG. 32).
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS62 is a preferred vector for expressing DACS/DAOCS activity in Penicillium, especially P. chrysogenum host cells.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS62 is most useful in cells that can additionally be selected using the HmR gene on plasmid pPS62.
      <br/>
      Illustrative examples of this method for selecting Penicillium transformants are described in Example 18.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      However, Penicillium strains are naturally somewhat resistant to hygromycin; optimal transformation conditions for using HmR as a selectable marker require the addition of hygromycin-sensitizing agents.
      <br/>
      A preferred method for selecting Penicillium transformants, which comprises an important aspect of the present invention, comprises (1) introducing a recombinant DNA vector comprising an acetamidase gene into a Penicillium host cell; and (2) culturing said host cell produced in step (1) in growth media that contains acetamide as the sole source of carbon or nitrogen.
      <br/>
      A preferred source of an illustrative acetamidase (amdS) gene, from Aspergillus nidulans, that can be used in the method is plasmid p3SR2 (NRRL B-18182).
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      A useful intermediate vector of the invention, designated as pPS51 (FIG. 21), is composed of the amds gene from plasmid p3SR2 fused to the backbone of plasmid pMLC12, as described in Example 8.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS51 was linearized with HindIII, treated with Klenow, and ligated to the .about.2.13 kb blunt-ended, hybrid DACS/DAOCS gene-containing fragment from plasmid pPS59 to create plasmid pPS61 (FIG. 31), as described in Example 16.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS61 is useful for expressing DACS/DAOCS activity in Penicillium, especially P. chrysogenum.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS61 is especially useful for transforming cells that can be subjected to growth on acetamide as a selection method.
      <br/>
      A description of this method for identifying Penicillium transformants using the amdS gene is described in Example 20.

      Plasmid pPS51 is used as a convenient source of the acetamidase gene in other constructions (FIG. 34).

      Example 9 describes the construction protocol for plasmid pPS52, which contains the DACS/DAOCS gene on an .about.7 kb BamHI fragment (from plasmid pPS51) and a synthetic linker.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pPS52 (FIG. 22) is useful for expressing DACS/DAOCS activity, especially for cells in which both the Cephalosporium DACS/DAOCS promoter functions and the amdS can be used to select for transformants.

      Plasmid pPS54 (FIG. 24) is a useful plasmid for expressing IPS activity, especially in cells in which both the Penicillium IPS promoter functions and the amdS gene can be used to select transformants, as described above.

      The construction protocol for plasmid pPS54 is described in Example 11.

      Nos. 895,008, filed Aug. 8, 1986, and 801,523, filed Nov. 25, 1985, and incorporated herein by reference) as well as the DACS/DAOCS gene allow many useful combinations of genes and recipients.
      <br/>
      For example, the Penicillium IPS gene can be introduced into high producing strains of Penicillium to increase the titer of penicillins produced in a fermentation, as exemplified by the use of plasmid pPS54 and the methods of Examples 18, 19, and 20.
      <br/>
      Another example is the introduction of the DACS/DAOCS gene into Penicillium via the use of plasmids pIT503, pPS52, pPS56, pPS58, pPS59, pPS60, pPS61, or pPS62 and the methods of Examples 18, 19, and 20, thereby facilitating the unprecedented production of cephalosporins in Penicillium.

      A particularly useful aspect of the present invention is the in vivo conversion of penicillin G and penicillin V to the corresponding cephalosporins via the action of the DACS/DAOCS or a modified version thereof in Penicillium.

      The desired fermentation products, cephalosporin G and cephalosporin V, are organic extractable.
      <br/>
      The present invention comprises a method for making a cephalosporin in a Penicillium host cell.

      The invention described herein is not restricted to the coding sequence of the DACS/DAOCS gene.
      <br/>
      Because plasmid pIT503 comprises over 3 kb of the genomic DNA that was located upstream of the DACS/DAOCS-encoding DNA in the Cephalosporium acremonium genome, plasmid pIT503 necessarily comprises the promoter and translational activating sequence of the DACS/DAOCS gene.
      <br/>
      Most promoters and associated translational activating sequences are encoded upstream of the DNA to be activated. (Some rRNA-encoding DNA sequences are activated by promoters that are not located upstream of the coding sequence.) "Upstream" is a word used in the art of molecular biology and, in the present context, refers to DNA in the 5' direction from the 5' end of the coding strand of the DACS/DAOCS sequence.

      Plasmids pIT503, pPS52, and pPS56 comprise the Cephalosporium acremonium promoter and translational activating sequence of the DACS/DAOCS gene.

      Although the sequence data on the C. acremonium promoter and translational activating sequence is limited, the activating sequence is believed to be encoded on the .about.440 bp SstI-HindIII restriction fragment located immediately upstream of and adjacent to the DACS/DAOCS coding sequence.
      <br/>
      Any restriction fragment that comprises the aforementioned .about.440 bp SstI-HindIII restriction fragment necessarily comprises the C. acremonium promoter and translational activating sequence.

      To further clarify how the activating sequence is oriented in plasmid pIT503, the sequence is illustrated with the HindIII cleavage site marked at the 5' (upstream) end and with the "ATG" that encodes the amino-terminal methionine of the DACS/DAOCS gene at the 3' end (the aforementioned SstI site is 60 bp into the coding sequence).

    <p num="137">This sequence, and larger sequences comprising the 3' regulatory sequences of the DACS/DAOCS gene, can be incorporated into recombinant DNA expression vectors.</p>
    <p num="138">
      The present invention is a pioneering invention in that it represents the first cloning and genetic engineering of a DNA sequence that encodes the DAOCS enzymatic activity, often called expandase activity, necessary to transform a penicillin into a cephalosporin.
      <br/>
      Many organisms other than Cephalosporium acremonium express a substantially similar, if not identical, expandase activity.
      <br/>
      The similarity of expandase activity in antibiotic-producing organisms of different genera results from a corresponding similarity of the amino acid sequence of the different expandases and of the DNA sequence encoding the expandase activity.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      The present invention provides both an amino acid and a DNA sequence for an expandase enzyme, specifically the DAOC synthetase of Cephalosporium acremonium, and thus can be used to isolate expandase enzyme-encoding DNA from  BETA -lactam-producing organisms.
      <br/>
      The present invention thus comprises any DAOCS-encoding DNA compound that can be isolated on the basis of its homology to any portion of the DACS/DAOCS coding sequence of C. acremonium.
      <br/>
      For instance, the present DNA sequences can be used to prepare labelled probes that can, in turn, be used to find expandase-encoding DNA sequences in the aforementioned 62 -lactam-producing organisms.
      <br/>
      The high G and C content of the present DAOCS-encoding DNA, .about.63%, makes the present DNA compounds especially useful for isolating DAOCS-encoding Streptomyces DNA, especially from S. clavuligerus.
      <br/>
      Streptomyces DNA is known to have high G and C content, often approaching 70%, so the high G and C content of the DNA of the present invention makes the present DNA compounds especially useful for isolating homologous S. clavuligerus or other streptomycetes DAOCS-encoding DNA sequences.
      <br/>
      This same homology of DNA sequence allows the DNA compounds of the invention to be used to identify compounds that encode DACS activity or both DACS and DAOCS activity.
      <br/>
      These homologous compounds comprise an important aspect of the present invention.

    <p num="151">
      The isolation of the .about.5.1 kb XbaI-BamHI restriction fragment of plasmid pKEN021 (106 in FIG. 4) is set forth in this Example section.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pKEN021 is a derivative of plasmid pKEN111 (101 in FIG. 2 and further described in Lee et al., 1981, J. Bact. 146: 861-866 and Zwiebel et al., 1981, J. Bact. 145: 654-656).
      <br/>
      Plasmid pKEN111 can be obtained from the Northern Regional Research Center (NRRL), Agricultural Research Service, Peoria, Ill. 61604, in E. coli CC620 under the accession number NRRL 15011.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pKEN111 has an .about.2.8 kb EcoRI restriction fragment that contains the E. coli lpp gene (see Nakamura and Inouye, 1979, Cell 18: 1109-1117).
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      In plasmid pKEN021, the 650 bp EcoRI-SalI restriction fragment of plasmid pBR322 has been replaced by E. coli lpp gene sequences.
      <br/>
      The lpp gene sequences include a 462 bp AluI fragment located upstream from the first triplet of the lpp coding sequence.
      <br/>
      This 462 bp fragment contains the promoter, 5' untranslated region, and ribosome binding site.
      <br/>
      A unique XbaI restriction site is located within the ribosome binding site 16 bp before the translation-initiating methionine codon.
      <br/>
      A PvuII restriction site located 105 bp upstream from the translation termination codon of the lpp coding sequence was changed to a BamHI restriction site by the addition of a synthetic DNA linker (5'-CCGGATCCGG-3', Collaborative Research Inc., 128 Spring Street, Lexington, Mass. 02173).
      <br/>
      The coding sequence for the last thirty-five amino acids of lipoprotein, the translation termination signal, and the sequence corresponding to the 3' untranslated region of the messenger RNA follow the BamHI site.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pKEN021 also includes some 850 bp of extraneous sequences located downstream of the lpp gene in the E. coli chromosome.

      Plasmid pCZR336 is an hGH expression vector constructed from the XbaI-BamHI backbone of plasmid pCZR111 (Example 2H) and the two-cistron, hGH construction from plasmid p1103 (Example 2D and FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      About 50  MU g of plasmid p1103 are incubated in 250  MU l of 1 * high-salt buffer containing .about.50 units each of BamHI and XbaI restriction enzyme for 2 hours at 37 (degree)  C. The .about.650 bp XbaI-BamHI fragment containing the first cistron and hGH coding sequence gene is isolated and purified from an acrylamide gel.

    <p num="209">
      Plasmid pCZR336 is an expression vector that utilizes the  LAMBDA pL promoter.
      <br/>
      To join the DACS/DAOCS to the  LAMBDA pL promoter in plasmid pCZR336, it was necessary to utilize a synthetic DNA linker.
      <br/>
      This linker joins the NdeI site of plasmid pCZR336 to the SstI site in the DACS/DAOCS coding sequence and has the structure depicted below:  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="210">
      This linker was synthesized on an automated DNA synthesizer as two separate single strands using conventional procedures.
      <br/>
      This linker has several differences from the native Cephalosporium sequence, none of which affect the protein encoded by the resulting coding sequence.
      <br/>
      These changes include: 1) creation of an NdeI site containing the translation initiation site; 2) a C to A change in the third position of codon 10, which remains a leucine codon as CTC and CTA are equivalent, to create an XbaI site; and 3) a C to T change in the third position of the fifth codon, which remains a valine codon as GTC and GTT are equivalent.
    </p>
    <p num="211">
      To facilitate future cloning efforts, the linker is first cloned into plasmid pUC19 (New England Biolabs).
      <br/>
      About 5  MU g of plasmid pUC19 are dissolved in 50  MU l of 1 * SstI buffer (50 mM NaCl; 50 mM Tris.HCl, pH=7.5; and 10 mM MgCl2) containing .about.10 units of SstI enzyme (BRL).
      <br/>
      The reaction is incubated for 2 hours at 37 (degree)  C. The NaCl concentration of the reaction mixture is then increased to 150 mM by adding 1  MU l of 5 M NaCl.
      <br/>
      About 2  MU l (10 units) of NdeI enzyme are added and the mixture incubated another 2 hours at 37 (degree)  C. The DNA is then precipitated and collected by centrifugation.

      About 100 nanograms of the SstI-NdeI-digested plasmid pUC19 are mixed with 1 picomole of the synthetic linker in ligase buffer with T4 DNA ligase.

      DAC and DAOC are preferably separated by a radially-packed, compressed microBondpak-NH4 column (0.8 * 10 cm) (Waters Assoc.) with a mobile phase of 2% acetic acid; 0.4% methyl alcohol; 6-7% acetonitrile; 87-92% water; and pH=3.8. The flow rate is 1.5-2.0 ml/min, and detection is at 260 nm (cephalosporin chromophore).

      For each transforming plasmid, an .about 0 (slashed zero) 1 ml suspension of osmotically fragile Penicillium chrysogenum cells (approximately 2 * 107 cells) is supplemented with 10  MU l of 50 mM CaCl2, 25  MU g of plasmid DNA in 5-15  MU l of TE buffer, and 0.9 ml of a solution of freshly dissolved polyethylene glycol 4000 (Baker, 40% weight/volume in osmotically stabilized buffer).

      <br/>
      To measure the total number of viable cells present in transformation mixtures, aliquots from the transformation mixture are plated on medium in which the acetamide is replaced with an equimolar amount of ammonium sulfate.
      <br/>
      Seven to ten days after transformation, transformant colonies of sufficient size to subculture are present on the acetamide medium.
      <br/>
      Abortive transformants are easily distinguished from stable transformants, because abortive transformants fail to grow upon subculture to fresh acetamide medium.
      <br/>
      Cells transformed with a plasmid containing the acetamidase gene form visible colonies in four to five days after transformation.

    <p num="349">
      Penicillium chrysogenum/p3SR2, P. chrysogenum/pPS52, and P. chrysogenum/pPS54 transformants express an acetamidase activity not detected in extracts of the untransformed recipient P. chrysogenum strain (e.g., ATCC 9480).
      <br/>
      This activity results in the ability of the transformed strains to grow using the ammonia released by acetamide hydrolysis when no other nitrogen sources are available.
      <br/>
      The ability of the transformants to grow on acetamide as sole nitrogen source indicates the functionality of the Aspergillus nidulans acetamidase gene in P. chrysogenum.
    </p>
    <p num="350">
      Stable transformants carry the transforming DNA in their high molecular weight DNA.
      <br/>
      Probes, e.g., plasmid pBR322 or fragments of Aspergillus DNA that contain the acetamidase gene, hybridize to the high molecular weight DNA from these transformants even after multiple passage on non-selective medium (ammonia as nitrogen source).
      <br/>
      The transforming phenotype (ability to grow on acetamide as sole nitrogen source) is also maintained by the transformants after passage on non-selective medium.
    </p>
    <p num="351">
      Plasmids containing the acetamidase gene are particularly useful as vectors for inserting genes into Penicillium chrysogenum, because no special recipient strain, such as an auxotroph, need be constructed, owing to the natural inability of P. chrysogenum to grow on acetamide as sole nitrogen source.
      <br/>
      Transformation systems based on complementation of auxotrophic markers by a gene in the transforming plasmid do not share this advantage.
      <br/>
      Frequently, pleiotropic mutations are associated with the introduction of an auxotrophic marker into a P. chrysogenum strain highly developed for penicillin production.
      <br/>
      Such mutations usually result in lower penicillin production (MacDonald et al., 1963, J. Gen. Microbiol. 33: 365-374).

      Plasmid pPS54 contains the Penicillium chrysogenum IPS gene.

      Plasmid pPS54 and derivatives of plasmid pPS54 that differ by replacement of the promoter of the Aspergillus nidulans acetamidase gene with the promoter from the the P. chrysogenum IPS gene can be used to generate Penicillium strains with higher penicillin V titers than their untransformed parents, owing to the greater production of IPS in the transformants.
      <br/>
      IPS functions in the biosynthetic pathway to penicillin V. The relative effectiveness of the plasmids in constructing overproducing strains for IPS and penicillin V depends on the parent plasmid: derivatives of plasmid pPS54 that differ from plasmid pPS54 by replacement of the promoter of the A. nidulans acetamidase gene with the promoter from the the P. chrysogenum IPS gene can produce transformants at higher frequency than does plasmid pPS54.

      <br/>
      After the petri plates are incubated at 15 (degree)  C. for 24 hours, 4 ml of liquified Noble agar (0.50% w/v at 42 (degree)  C.) containing 1.0 M KCl and enough hygromycin B to achieve a final plate concentration of 250-500  MU g/ml are added to each petri dish.
      <br/>
      After the overlay has solidified, the petri plates are incubated at 25 (degree)  C. in a humidified chamber.
      <br/>
      To measure the total of viable cells present in the transformation mixture, aliquots from the transformation mixture are plated on base medium with no overlays.
      <br/>
      Fourteen to twenty one days after transformation, transformant colonies of sufficient size to subculture are present on selective medium (base medium with hygromycin B overlay).
      <br/>
      Abortive transformants are easily distinguished from stable transformants, because abortive transformants fail to grow upon subculture to base medium supplemented with 250-500  MU g/ml of hygromycin B. Cells transformed with a plasmid containing the hybrid HmR gene (utilizing the pIPSp promoter) form visible colonies in seven to ten days after transformation.

      This activity results in the ability of the transformed strains to grow in the presence of toxic concentrations of hygromycin B (with entry of hygromycin B into the fungal cells facilitated by exposure to cadmium ion and trifluoroperizine �TFP�).
      <br/>
      The ability of the transformants to grow in the presence of toxic concentrations of hygromycin B (potentiated by cadmium and TFP) indicates that the hybrid HmR gene functions gene in P. chrysogenum.
      <br/>
      The higher transformation frequencies obtained with plasmid pPS57, as compared to plasmid pPS55, indicate that the promoter and 5' regulatory sequences of the P. chrysogenum IPS work better in P. chrysogenum than do the promoter and 5' regulatory sequences of the Cephalosporium acremonium IPS gene, present in the hybrid HmR genes carried by plasmid pPS55.

      This digestion procedure produces a heterogenous population of protoplasts with respect to size.
      <br/>
      The largest protoplasts regenerate cell walls and transform at a higher frequency than smaller protoplasts.
      <br/>
      A population of protoplasts enriched for large protoplasts is harvested by centrifugation at 100 * g for 2 minutes in a table-top clinical centrifuge.
      <br/>
      The supernatant is discarded, and the pelleted protoplasts are washed by resuspension in the osmotically stabilized buffer (pH=7.0) and harvested by centrifugation (550 * g for 6 minutes).
      <br/>
      The washing procedure is repeated two times.
      <br/>
      The washed protoplasts are resuspended in a sufficient amount of 0.8 M NaCl to achieve a concentration of 2 to 3 * 109 protoplasts per ml, by hemacytometer count.
    </p>
    <p num="384">F. Transformation Procedure</p>
    <p num="385">
      For each plasmid to be transformed, a 0.1 ml suspension containing 1 to 5 * 107 protoplasts of Cephalosporium in 0.8 M NaCl and 80 mM CaCl2, is used.
      <br/>
      About 20  MU g of plasmid and polyethylene glycol 4000 are added, as described in Example 18, to the suspension of protoplasts to achieve a transformation mixture volume of 1.1 ml. The mixture is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature and then centrifuged at 100 * g for 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      The protoplasts are then vortexed back into suspension in the same liquid.
      <br/>
      Aliquots (0.1 ml) are delivered to the surface of Trypticase-Soy Agar medium (BBL) that has been enriched with 10.8% sucrose to osmotically stabilize the protoplasts.
      <br/>
      After incubation of the petri plates at 15 (degree)  C. for 24 hours, 4 ml of liquified agar (0.41% w/v, at 42 (degree)  C.) containing 0.8 M NaCl and sufficient hygromycin B to achieve a final concentration of 100  MU g/ml are added to each petri plate. C. acremonium strains exhibiting slow growth rates due to extensive mutagenesis are subjected to a reduced level of hygromycin B during the selection procedure (i.e., 10  MU g/ml final concentration).
      <br/>
      After the overlay has solidified, the petri plates are incubated at 25 (degree)  C. in a humidified chamber.
      <br/>
      Transformant colonies of sufficient size to subculture are present after four to five days incubation; however, slower growing transformants may take as long as 8 days to develop.
      <br/>
      Abortive transformants are easily distinguished from stable transformants, because abortive transformants fail to grow upon subculture to fresh medium containing the original selective level of hygromycin B.
    </p>
    <p num="386">G. Analysis of Cephalosporium acremonium/pPS56 Transformants</p>
    <p num="387">
      Stable Cephalosporium acremonium/pPS56 transformants carry the transforming DNA in their high molecular weight DNA.
      <br/>
      The transforming phenotype of such transformants (the ability to grow in the presence of concentrations of hygromycin B that kill the untransformed recipient C. acremonium strain) is maintained after growth on non-selective medium.
    </p>
    <p num="388">
      Plasmid pPS56 is particularly effective in inserting multiple copies of the DACS/DAOCS gene into the Cephalosporium acremonium high molecular weight DNA, because it contains a hybrid HmR gene that functions as a dominant selectable marker in C. acremonium.
      <br/>
      No special recipient strains, such as auxotrophs, need to be used as parent strains in transformations employing pPS56, owing to the natural inability of C. acremonium to grow in the presence of hygromycin B as specified above.
      <br/>
      No additives, e.g., cadmium ion or trifluoroperizine, need be added to enhance sensitivity of C. acremonium to hygromycin B.
    </p>
    <p num="389">
      Plasmid pPS56 can be used to generate strains of Cephalosporium acremonium with cephalosporin C titers higher than untransformed strains, due to extra copies of the DAOCS/DACS gene.
      <br/>
      The extra gene copies cause higher DAOCS/DACS activities, which promote increased synthesis of cephalosporin C. Strains of C. acremonium producing large amounts of cephalosporin C and significant amounts of penicillin N are particularly useful parent strains for transformations employing plasmid pPS56 to obtain transformants that more efficiently convert penicillin N into cephalosporin C. The desired C. acremonium/pPS56 transformants bear the transforming DNA as inserts in regions neutral with respect to growth and antibiotic production so that only the effect of increased DAOCS and DACS on cephalosporin C synthesis occurs. C. acremonium/pPS56 transformants with improved cephalosporin C production are useful in the manufacture of clinically significant cephalosporin antibiotics, such as cephalothin sodium, cefamandole nafate, and cefazolin sodium.
    </p>
    <p num="390">
      The CAT gene present on plasmid pPS56 is an important facet of the utility of plasmid pPS56 in transformations designed to create strains that exhibit increased cephalosporin C production.
      <br/>
      Large amounts of the plasmid may be conveniently obtained from E. coli transformed with plasmid pPS56 and selected for resistance to chloramphenicol.
      <br/>
      In addition, the CAT gene product is suitable for obtaining Cephalosporium acremonium transformants that overproduce  BETA -lactam antibiotics.
      <br/>
      Although bacterial regulatory signals are usually not expressed in eucaryotic cells, there have been reports of low level expression of some bacterial genes, in particular  BETA -lactamase genes, in eucaryotic cells.
      <br/>
      Unlike  BETA -lactamases, the CAT gene product does not destroy  BETA -lactam antibiotics.
      <br/>
      Hence the use of the CAT gene as a selectable marker is preferred.
