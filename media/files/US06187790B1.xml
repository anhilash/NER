    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to methods for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in males and females (including but not limited to erectile dysfunction in males).</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Impotence or erectile insufficiency is a widespread disorder that is thought to affect about twelve percent of adult men under age forty-five, about twenty percent of men at age sixty, and about fifty-five percent of men at age seventy-five.
      <br/>
      Similar to male sexual dysfunction, the prevalence of female sexual dysfunction has been shown to increase with age and be associated with the presence of vascular risk factors and the development of menopause.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      There is more than one cause of erectile dysfunction.
      <br/>
      For example, erectile dysfunction can be psychological, resulting from anxiety or depression, with no apparent somatic or organic impairment.
      <br/>
      Such erectile dysfunction, which is referred to as "psychogenic", is responsible for about fifteen to twenty percent of cases of impotence.
      <br/>
      In other cases, the erectile dysfunction is associated with atherosclerosis of the arteries supplying blood to the penis; such dysfunction is referred to as "arteriogenic" or "atherosclerotic." About forty to sixty percent of cases of impotence are arteriogenic in origin.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In still other cases, there is leakage from veins in the penis such that sufficient pressure for an erection can be neither obtained nor maintained.
      <br/>
      This dysfunction is referred to as "venous leakage," or "abnormal drainage".
      <br/>
      This condition is often exacerbated by the presence of some arteriogenic dysfunction whereby the supply of blood to the penis is impaired.
      <br/>
      In still other cases, the dysfunction is associated with a neuropathy, such as nerve damage arising from, for example, surgery or a pelvic injury, in the nervous system affecting the penis.
      <br/>
      Such a dysfunction is referred to as "neurogenic" and this accounts for about ten to fifteen percent of cases of impotence.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      There is also a high incidence of erectile insufficiency among diabetics, particularly those with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
      <br/>
      Erectile dysfunction in diabetics is often classified as "diabetogenic," although the underlying dysfunction is usually neurogenic associated with neuropathy, but may be arteriogenic or neurogenic and arteriogenie.
      <br/>
      About half of diabetic males suffer from erectile insufficiency, and about half of the cases of neurogenic impotence are in diabetics.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Additionally, erectile insufficiency is sometimes a side effect of certain drugs, such as beta-blockers that are administered to reduce blood pressure in persons suffering from hypertension, or drugs administered to treat depression or anxiety.
      <br/>
      Excessive alcohol consumption has also been linked to erectile insufficiency.
      <br/>
      These forms of erectile insufficiency may be regarded as a subset of neurogenic or psychogenic insufficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A number of methods to treat impotence are available.
      <br/>
      These treatments include pharmacological treatments, surgery and, in cases of psychogenic dysfunction, psychological counseling is sometimes effective.
      <br/>
      Psychogenic impotence often can be cured by counseling coupled with a demonstration to the patient that he is capable of having a full erection by inducing such an erection once or a few times in the patients.
      <br/>
      Insufficiency due to excessive alcohol consumption is sometimes cured by reducing or elimination such consumption.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In rare cases, where the insufficiency is physical because of venous leakage, surgery can usually be employed to repair the venous lesion and thereby either cure the insufficiency or, if there remains an erectile insufficiency after repair of the venous lesion, render the insufficiency amenable to treatment by pharmacological methods.
      <br/>
      Also, penile implants, which provide a mechanical means to produce an erection sufficient for vaginal penetration, are widely used to treat impotence.
      <br/>
      In recent years, implants have been employed, especially in cases where pharmacological intervention is ineffective, which are usually cases of severe atherogenic impotence.
      <br/>
      Treatment of impotence with penile implants, however, entails serious disadvantages.
      <br/>
      Such treatment requires surgery and necessitates total destruction of the erectile tissues of the penis, forever precluding normal erection.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Pharmacological methods of treatment are also available.
      <br/>
      Such methods, however, have not proven to be highly satisfactory and can be accompanied by severe side-effects.
      <br/>
      Papaverine is now widely used to treat impotence, although papaverine is ineffective in overcoming impotence due, at least in part, to severe atherosclerosis.
      <br/>
      Papaverine is effective in cases where the dysfunction is psychogenic or neurogenic and severe atherosclerosis is not involved.
      <br/>
      Injection of papaverine, a smooth muscle relaxant, or phenoxybenzamine, a non-specific blocker and hypotensive, into a corpus cavernosum has been found to cause an erection sufficient for vaginal penetration.
      <br/>
      Also, in cases where severe atherosclerosis is not a cause of the dysfunction, intracavernosal injection of phentolamine, an  ALPHA -adrenergic blocker, causes an erection sufficient for vaginal penetration.
      <br/>
      The resulting erection is one of significantly shorter duration than that induced by intracavernosal injection of papaverine or phenoxybenzamine and is of such short duration that satisfactory sexual relations are difficult or impossible.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Treatment of impotence with papaverine or phenoxybenzamine often results in priapism, a locking-up of an erection for a long period of time, typically a few hours and sometimes longer than twenty-four hours.
      <br/>
      Priapism is a serious, deleterious side effect of treatment of erectile insufficiency with these drugs.
      <br/>
      Beyond the embarrassment that may be caused for some men, priapism is usually painful, irreversibly damages erectile tissue, and, to be relieved, requires bleeding or pharmacological intervention, such as injection of a sympathomimetic drug, such as adrenaline.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Even if priapism does not occur with use of papaverine, such use is associated with a painful, burning sensation in the first two or so minutes after the injection and there are indications that repeated use of papaverine causes undesirable, extensive intracavernous fibrosis.
      <br/>
      Further, as indicated above, impotence arising from severe atherosclerosis is not susceptible to treatment with papaverine, phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine or papaverine together with phentolamine.
      <br/>
      In any case, phenoxybenzamine is not suitable for use in treating impotence because it is a carcinogen.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Thus, although impotence is a ubiquitous problem, there are few satisfactory methods available for treating this disorder.
      <br/>
      Because of the relatively invasive intervention involved and the high failure rate of penile prostheses, surgical approaches provide unattractive alternatives.
      <br/>
      A safe pharmacological approach to the treatment of impotence is still to be achieved.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="47">
      The present invention relates to methods for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in males and females (including but not limited to erectile dysfunction in males).
      <br/>
      The compositions comprise quinolines, including derivatives thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates the use of compositions that are effective to induce an erection in a human male suffering from impotence of any origin, other than anatomical deficiencies (i.e., lacking a penis or a significant portion thereof) that preclude an erection sufficient for vaginal penetration.
      <br/>
      In particular, these compositions may be used to induce an erection in a male suffering from impotence caused by severe atherosclerosis, and also impotence that is neurogenic or psychogenic in origin.
      <br/>
      The compositions utilized in the methods of the present invention comprise cilostazol, including derivatives thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (type III) that suppresses platelet aggregation and also acts as a direct arterial vasodilator.
      <br/>
      In addition to its reported vasodilator and antiplatelet effects, cilostazol has been proposed to have beneficial effects on plasma lipoproteins, increasing plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoliproprotein (See e.g., Dawson et al., Circulation 98: 678-686 �1998�; Elam et al., Arterioscler Thromb.
      <br/>
      Vasc. Biol. 18: 1942-1947�1998�; Drug Evaluation Monographs, vol. 99, Micromedex Inc.).
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Method of preparation of cilostazol are set forth by Nishi et al. (Chem. Pharm. Bull. 31: 1151�1983�, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,277,479, hereby incorporated by reference), and its pharmacology, metabolism, mechanism of action and clinical evaluations are described in Arzneimittel-Forsch. 35: 1117-1208 (1985), hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      While it is not necessary to understand any particular mechanism to carry out the present invention, it is believed that in some circumstances cilostazol can act as a direct-acting vasodilator to relax the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells, which in turn increases blood flow into the cavernosa space.
      <br/>
      This then leads to increased cavernosa pressure to produce an erect penis.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In one embodiment cilostazol is administered.
      <br/>
      It is contemplated that cilostazol be administered cutaneously, transurethrally, by standard injection, intracavernosally, intranasally or through respiratory inhalation, although it is not intended that the methods of the present invention be limited to the mode of administration of cilostazol.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, cilostazol is administered as a tablet.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, cilostazol is administered as a pharmaceutical composition.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      While the present invention is not limited to the treatment of a particular patient group, it is contemplated that the methods of the present invention comprise the utilization of pharmaceutical compounds and compositions to patients who are free of symptoms of cardiac disease and who have not been treated with drugs which cause hypotensive effects, such as nitrites and nitrates.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, cilostazol may potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its administration to patients who are concurrently using organic nitrates in any form may be contraindicated.
    </p>
    <heading>DIAGNOSIS OF MALE ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION</heading>
    <p num="53">
      Determination whether a human male is suffering from impotence that is substantially only neurogenic or psychogenic is readily made by a person skilled in the art using a number of readily available diagnostic procedures.
      <br/>
      Thus, a male suffering from impotence can first be given a physical examination with particular attention to possible penile and scrotal pathology, whereby any anatomical deficiency precluding an erection sufficient for vaginal penetration can be detected.
      <br/>
      In the absence of such an anatomical deficiency, the male can be subjected to tests, whereby penile venous leakage or severe or untreatable atherosclerosis can be detected.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Such tests include determination of the penobrachial blood pressure index (PBPI), doppler investigation of the penile arteries, and a papaverine test.
      <br/>
      The PBPI is the penile systolic blood pressure divided by the systolic blood pressure determined at one of the arms.
      <br/>
      These blood pressures can be determined by any number of standard techniques.
      <br/>
      Thus, the penile systolic blood pressure can be determined by i) placing an inflatable cuff around the base of the free part of the penis in the flaccid state which is capable of being used to apply variable pressure, readable from a gauge, to an object around which the cuff is placed, ii) localizing the penile arteries with a Doppler ultrasound probe (e.g., 8 MHz probe, such as the Mini Doplex D500 available from Huntleigh Technology, Luton, United Kingdom), and then iii) inflating and deflating the cuff and ascertaining the pressure at which the Doppler sound reappears.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The pressure at which the Doppler sound reappears is the penile systolic blood pressure.
      <br/>
      A male's penile blood pressure is regarded as normal if his PBPI is &gt;0.80. With regard to Doppler investigation, each of the two penile cavernous arteries is investigated distal to the aforementioned cuff using the Doppler ultrasound problem.
      <br/>
      The function of each of the two arteries is assessed by Doppler ultrasound using an arbitrary scale of 0, 1, 2 or 3, where 0 means that the function is so deficient that the artery cannot be located and 3 means that the artery is well enough that maximal Doppler sound is observed.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      In the papaverine test, a tourniquet is placed at the base of the free part of the penis and tightened and then, with the patient seated, 30 mg of papaverine in 1 ml of a physiologically acceptable fluid (e.g., physiological saline or phosphate-buffered saline) is injected into the penile cavernous body.
      <br/>
      In persons suspected of having impotence due to a suprasacral nerve lesion or a psychogenic dysfunction, only 15 mg of papaverine is administered, because of the high incidence of papaverine-induced priapism in such cases.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Five minutes after the injection, the tourniquet is removed and an ultrasound Doppler investigation of the penile cavernous arteries is carried out as described above.
      <br/>
      The function of the arteries is regarded as normal if both of them score a 3 on the arbitrary scale.
      <br/>
      After the Doppler investigation, penile vibration, at about a 4 Hz with an amplitude of about 1.2 mm (carried out with, e.g., a Vibrector, from Multicept, Gentofte, Denmark) is carried out for five to ten minutes and then erectile response is evaluated.
    </p>
    <p num="58">Erectile response is classified as full rigidity, if the angle between the penis and the legs in the standing position is &gt;90 (degree) , and tumescence or no response if the angle is less than or equal to 45 (degree) . An impotent male, who does not have an anatomical deficiency that would preclude having an erection sufficient for vaginal penetration, who has a PBPI &gt;0.80, who has scores of 2 or 3 in Doppler ultrasound investigations of both of the cavernous arteries of the penis, after papaverine injection as described above, and who has a fully rigid erection after papaverine injection and vibration as described above, is suffering from impotence that is "substantially only neurogenic or psychogenic" in origin.</p>
    <p num="59">It is possible that atherosclerosis or venous leakage contributes to such impotence, and atherosclerosis likely does contribute if the score is less than 3 in the Doppler investigation of one or both of the cavernous arteries after papaverine injection; but any venous leakage or atherosclerosis in such impotence is not untreatable and, consequently, is not a substantial factor in the impotence and such atherosclerosis, if any, is less than severe.</p>
    <p num="60">
      Impotence, which is a side-effect of drugs such as beta-blockers, is deemed to be neurogenic impotence in the present specification.
      <br/>
      Similarly, impotence which is a result of alcoholism or excessive consumption of alcohol, is deemed to be neurogenic or psychogenic impotence, for purposes of the present specification.
      <br/>
      Thus, a male who is diagnosed in accordance with the present specification as suffering from impotence that is "substantially only neurogenic or psychogenic" in origin is suffering from impotence that is substantially only neurogenic, psychogenic or neurogenic and psychogenic in origin, even though an underlying cause of the impotence has been identified as a side-effect of a drug, alcoholism or excessive consumption of alcohol.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Generally, a male with a PBPI less than about 0.60, with scores of 0 in Doppler investigations of both penile cavernous arteries (after papaverine injection as described above), and with a less than fully rigid erection after papaverine injection and vibration will have impotence caused by "untreatable" atherosclerosis.
      <br/>
      Methods are available to ascertain whether impotence is untreatable because of venous leakage.
    </p>
    <p num="62">One method of ascertaining whether untreatable venous leakage is a cause of impotence is by cavemosometry, optionally supplemented with cavernosography. �See, e.g., Delcour et al., Radiology 161:799 (1986); Porst et al., J Urol. 137:1163 (1987); Lue et al., J. Urol. 37:829 (1987)�. Cavernosometry can be done using, both before and after intracavernosal injection of 60 mg of papaverine (in 1 ml of physiological saline), infusion of physiological saline through a 19-gauge needle into one corpus cavernosum with a 21-gauge needle inserted into the other corpus cavernosum for measurement of intracorporal pressure (which is recorded on a plotter).</p>
    <p num="63">
      The infusion rates needed to induce and maintain an erection are measured.
      <br/>
      If the infusion rate needed to maintain an erection is greater than 50 ml/min before administration of the papaverine and greater than 15 ml/min after administration of the papaverine, untreatable venous leakage is present.
      <br/>
      As long as an erection can be achieved at some flow rate less than about 100 ml/min before injection of the papaverine and less than about 50 ml/min after the injection of papaverine, it might be possible, using cavernosography, to locate the venous lesion associated with the leakage, and thereby confirm the diagnosis based on cavernosometry and provide information for possible surgical correction for the leakage.
      <br/>
      In the cavernosography, the penis is X-rayed, both before and after intracavernosal injection of 60 mg papaverine (in 1 ml of physiological saline), while infusing contrast medium into the corpus cavernosum (e.g., through a 19-gauge needle) at a flow rate that maintains an erection during the X-ray.
      <br/>
      Numerous contrast media suitable for the procedure are available in the art; these are typically aqueous solutions of iodinated compounds that provide between about 180 mg/ml and about 360 mg/ml of iodine.
      <br/>
      Examples are a solution of iohexol providing 240 mg/ml of iodine sold by Winthrop Pharmaceuticals, New York, N.Y., USA, and a solution of iopamidol providing 300 mg/ml iodine sold by Astra Meditec, Goteborg, Sweden.
      <br/>
      Typically 50-100 ml of the contrast medium will be employed for each x-ray (i.e., before and then after the injection of papaverine).
      <br/>
      In the cavernosometry and cavernosography, 30 mg papaverine (in 1 ml physiological saline) coupled with stimulation by vibration can be employed in place of 60 mg papaverine (in 1 ml physiological saline).

      The present invention is not limited by the method of introduction of the therapeutic compound to the body.
      <br/>
      Among other methods, the present invention contemplates administering cutaneously, orally, intracavemosally, transurethrally, by standard injection, intranasally or through respiratory inhalation.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      While the present invention is not limited to a specific dosage level, a single dosage per day of 100 milligrams for adult humans is contemplated.
      <br/>
      Multiple dosage is also contemplated.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, a dosage of less than 100 milligrams per day is contemplated (i.e., 50 to 75 milligrams).
    </p>
    <p num="67">Peak plasma concentrations of cilostazol are observed 2-4 hours following oral administration (See e.g., Suri et al., J. Clin. Pharmacol. 38: 144-150 �1998�; Niki and Mori, Arzneimittelforschung 35: 1173-1185 �1985�).</p>
    <p num="68">
      While the present invention is not limited by the form of oral administration, aqueous and organic solutions of cilostazol for oral administration are contemplated.
      <br/>
      Likewise, cilostazol can be associated with a solid pharmaceutical carrier for solid oral administration.
      <br/>
      The compositions may be formulated in a manner known to one skilled in the art, using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers suitable for use in such compositions that are also well known in the art.
      <br/>
      It is contemplated that the compositions of the present invention comprise 0.1-90% by weight of cilostazol.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, cilostazol can be prepared in tablet form by mixing cilostazol with an inert diluent such as lactose (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,627,191 to Birch et al., hereby incorporated by reference).
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, cilostazol is administered as a tablet.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Cilostazol may also be administered cutaneously in a carrier adapted for topical administration.
      <br/>
      Such carriers include creams, ointments, lotions, pastes, jellies, sprays, aerosols, bath oils, or other pharmaceutical carriers which accomplish direct contact between cilostazol and the pore of the skin.
      <br/>
      In some cases it may be necessary to dissolve cilostazol in an appropriate organic solvent to facilitate incorporation into a pharmaceutical preparation.
      <br/>
      One skilled in the art is able to readily prepare such pharmaceutical formulations (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,719,197 to Kanios et al., hereby incorporated by reference).
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Likewise, the present invention can be incorporated in other products associated with sexual activity.
      <br/>
      For example, a coated, erection inducing condom as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,829,991, hereby incorporated by reference, can be utilized with cilostazol.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      While the present invention is not limited by a specific method of introducing cilostazol intracavemosally, injection of cilostazol can be carried out by any conventional injection means (e.g., employing an hypodermic syringe and needle or a similar device such as the NovolinPen. sold by Squibb-Novo, Inc., Princeton, N.J., USA).
      <br/>
      This injection may be by subject injecting himself or by another person (such as a partner during sexual relations or a physician prior to sexual relations) injecting the male whose erection is to be induced.
      <br/>
      Methods for intracavemosal injection are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,912 to Gerstenberg et al., hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Cilostazol can be introduced intracavemosally in a physiologically acceptable composition.
      <br/>
      Such compositions are aqueous solutions that are physiologically acceptable for administration by intracavemosal injection into the penis.
      <br/>
      The physiologically acceptable carrier is selected such that it is not painful or irritating upon intracavernosal injection.
      <br/>
      The physiologically acceptable compositions will preferably be sterile at the time of administration by intracavernosal injection.
    </p>
    <p num="73">Among the physiologically acceptable compositions for use in the methods is physiological saline or phosphate buffered saline, in which cilostazol is dissolved or suspended, such that the resulting composition is suitable for intracavernosal injection.</p>
    <p num="74">
      In carrying out the methods, it is preferred that, for a period of time between about 1 minute and about 15 minutes (preferably about 5 minutes-10 minutes), the penis is constricted near the base thereof and between the base and the point at which the injection into a corpus cavernosum occurs, in order to limit loss of injected fluid from the corpus cavernosum before the ingredients in the fluid, that are active in inducing erection, have been able to have erection-inducing effects.
      <br/>
      The constriction can be effected by any means known in the art, such as with a tourniquet, cuff, rubber band or the like, or even manually, in order to slow the release of the injected fluid and the pharmacologically active substance(s) therein into the general circulation.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      Likewise, the present invention is not limited by a particular method for introducing cilostazol transurethrally.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, cilostazol is introduced to the urethra in a carrier as described for cutaneous administration.
      <br/>
      Devices and methods for transurethral introduction of pharmaceutical compositions is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,535 to Place et al.; Voss, U.S. Pat. No. 4,801,587 and Kock, EPA 0357581, all hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Additional methods of introducing cilostazol transurethrally include the use of medicated catheters, such as those used to prevent or treat localized infections and irritation of the urethra and bladder (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,640,912, hereby incorporated by reference).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, transurethral administration of pharmaceutical compositions is presented in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,478,822, 4,610,868, 4,640,912 and 4,746,508, all hereby incorporated by reference, and medicated urethral suppositories, inserts or plugs, typically containing anti-infective agents or spermicide are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,897,423, 2,584,166, 2,696,209 and 3,373,746, all incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      While the present invention is not limited to the method of injecting cilostazol in the preferred embodiment, cilostazol is injected with a standard syringe.
      <br/>
      One skilled in the art would be capable of injecting cilostazol with a carrier as described for intracavernosal injection.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Cilostazol may also be administered intranasally.
      <br/>
      Formulations suitable for intranasal administration include ointments, creams, lotions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols, oils and other pharmaceutical carriers which accomplish direct contact between cilostazol and the nasal cavity.
      <br/>
      Examples of pharmaceutical compositions administered intranasally are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,393,773 and 5,554,639 to Craig et al.; 5,603,943 to Yanagawa; and 5,801,161 to Merkus, all hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      Cilostazol may also be administered through respiratory inhalation.
      <br/>
      Formulations suitable for respiratory inhalation include ointments, creams, lotions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols, oils and other pharmaceutical carriers which accomplish direct contact between cilostazol and the respiratory tract.
      <br/>
      Examples of pharmaceutical compositions administered through respiratory inhalation are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,552,891 to Hu et al.; 5,869,479 to Kreutner et al., and 5,864,037 to Chasis et al.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      In some embodiments, intranasal administration and respiratory inhalation are the preferred modes of administration due to the ease of administration and faster onset of therapeutic activity.
      <br/>
      It is contemplated that intranasal administration and respiratory inhalation are advantageous as they may allow a smaller effective dosage to be administered than would be possible with the oral route of administration.
      <br/>
      A preferred mode of administration comprises administration to the lung.
      <br/>
      Intrapulmonary delivery of pharmacologic agents to patients can be accomplished via aerosolization.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the agent may be administered to the lung through a bronchoscope.
      <br/>
      Of course, the therapeutic agents may be investigated for their efficacy via other routes of administration, including parenteral administration.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      In one embodiment, the administration of the compositions of the present invention is accompanied by sexual stimulation to induce an erection.
      <br/>
      The sexual stimulation can begin before or after the introduction of cilostazol.
      <br/>
      If the stimulation begins after the injection, it is preferably begun within 5 to 10 minutes to insure that there is significant overlap of the pharmacological effects of the pharmaceutical composition administered and the stimulative effects of the sexual stimulation.
      <br/>
      Whether the stimulation begins before or after the injection, it will continue preferably at least until an erection sufficient for vaginal penetration is achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Sexual stimulation as prescribed by these methods, includes any form of sexual stimulation that would induce an erection in a normal male who is not suffering from erectile insufficiency.
      <br/>
      The sexual stimulation can be that which occurs in the course of sexual relations between the subject and another person or can be outside sexual relations with another person.
      <br/>
      Examples of methods of sexual stimulation include, alone or in combination, touching or erotically manipulating erogenous areas of the genital organs or other erogenous parts of the body; providing visual stimulation, as with a sexually explicit media (e.g., pornographic film) or other form of sexually stimulative show or display.
      <br/>
      Additionally, providing vibratory stimulation to the penis, at between about 30 Hz and about 100 Hz with an amplitude of about 1 mm to about 5 ram, as can be provided, for example, by resting the penis on the table of a vibrating apparatus such as that of a Vibrector system (Multicept, Genofte, Denmark).
    </p>
    <p num="83">In inducing an erection in an impotent male outside of sexual relations, as, for example, when a physician induces an erection in a patient suffering from psychogenic impotence, a preferred method of sexual stimulation includes providing visual stimulation, as with a pornographic film, simultaneously with vibratory stimulation of the penis, as with a Vibrector system set to between about 30 Hz and about 60 Hz (usually about 50 Hz)in frequency and between about 1 mm and about 2.5 mm (usually about 2.2 mm) in amplitude.</p>
    <p num="84">
      From the above, it should be clear that the present invention provides methods of treatment of male erectile dysfunction with pharmaceutical agents.
      <br/>
      In particular, cilostazol is administered therapeutically to patients having such dysfunction.
