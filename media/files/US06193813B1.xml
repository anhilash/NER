      A method of processing a substrate, such as a semiconductor wafer, in a vacuum processing chamber includes the steps of depositing a material on a surface of the substrate using a gas mixture, and purging the chamber of residual gases by flowing SiH4 into the chamber.
      <br/>
      Preferably, WSix is deposited on a semiconductor wafer using a mixture comprising WF6, dichlorosilane and a noble gas, and the chamber is subsequently purged of residual WF6 and dichlorosilane by flowing SiH4 into the chamber.A further method of processing a substrate in a vacuum processing chamber includes the step of conditioning the chamber by flowing SiH4 into the chamber prior to depositing a material on the surface of the substrate.Semiconductor wafers processed according to the inventive method are characterized by more uniform sheet resistance values and reduced film stress.A vacuum processing apparatus for practicing methods of the invention includes a chamber, means for depositing a material, such as WSix, on a surface of a substrate disposed within the chamber, and means for purging the chamber with SiH4.

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to an improved chemical vapor deposition process, such as a process for the deposition of tungsten suicide (WSix) from tungsten hexafluoride (WF6) and dichlorosilane (DCS).
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a process including a novel silane (SiH4) purge step subsequent to deposition of WSix on a substrate.
      <br/>
      The present invention further relates to a process including a novel SiH4 soak step prior to deposition of WSix on a substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Tungsten silicide (WSix) thin films have been deposited by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) onto semiconductor substrates using silane (SiH4) and tungsten hexafluoride (WF6) as the precursor gases.
      <br/>
      Typically, the WSix thin film is deposited onto a semiconductor wafer having a layer of silicon oxide beneath a polysilicon layer.
      <br/>
      The foregoing process, however, has proven less than completely satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One problem with the foregoing process is that the deposited costing is not as conformal over stepped topographies as is desired.
      <br/>
      Another problem is that films so deposited have a high residual fluorine content that adversely affects device performance.
      <br/>
      For example, when the wafer is exposed to elevated no temperatures, e.g., about 850 (degree)  C. or higher, as during annealing, the excess fluoride ions migrate through the underlying polysilicon layer and into the underlying silicon oxide layer.
      <br/>
      The effective thickness of the silicon oxide layer thus appears to increase.
      <br/>
      This effective thickness increase in turn leads to an adverse change in electrical properties of semiconductor devices including such layers.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      When using a multichamber vacuum processing system such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,951,601, to Maydan et al., incorporated herein by reference, the substrate to be coated with tungsten silicide first is cleaned using a fluorine plasma scrub to remove native oxide from the polysilicon layer.
      <br/>
      The cleaned substrate is then transferred into a substrate transfer chamber.
      <br/>
      This transfer chamber has a nitrogen or argon atmosphere (subatmospheric) to prevent re-oxidation of the substrate, and contains a robot to transfer the substrate into a processing chamber, e.g., a tungsten deposition chamber, through a slit valve having an O-ring seal.
      <br/>
      This CVD process has become the standard for depositing tungsten silicide from SiH4 and WF6.
      <br/>
      However, as substrates become larger, and feature sizes for devices become smaller, the above problems of step coverage and residual fluorine using this deposition process have become critical limitations for future applications.

    <p num="8">
      An improved process for depositing WSix films using dichlorosilane (DCS) instead of SiH4 has been proposed.
      <br/>
      The resultant WSix films have reduced fluorine content and are more conformal than those deposited using SiH4 as the precursor gas, thereby providing a solution to the SiH4 -based deposition process limitations.
      <br/>
      In order to deposit WSix films which have good conformality, low fluoride content and good adhesion to a substrate such as a silicon wafer (which can have one or more layers thereon), it has been found beneficial to exclude nitrogen from the deposition chamber during the deposition process.
      <br/>
      Such an improved process is provided by copending application Ser.

      <br/>
      In this process (the "DCS process"), tungsten silicide thin films are made by passing WF6, DCS and a noble carrier gas into a tungsten deposition chamber from which nitrogen is excluded.

      In deposition processes, it is customary to purge the deposition chamber and gas delivery lines after each semiconductor wafer is processed in order to remove residual reactive and carrier gases from the chamber and the delivery lines.
      <br/>
      The DCS process described above typically includes a purge step employing DCS as the purge gas.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      It has been found, however, that depositing WSix on semiconductor wafers according to the DCS process is associated with a noticeable downward drift in the sheet resistance of wafers so processed, over both short and long terms.
      <br/>
      Using the DCS process, the sheet resistance has been observed to decrease by 2  OMEGA /square over the course of processing 25 wafers.
      <br/>
      This short-term resistivity drift amounts to a decrease of 5% or more.
      <br/>
      A long-term resistivity drift over the course of processing 500 wafers, amounting to 4-5  OMEGA /square, has also been observed.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="22">
      We have discovered that use of silane, or more precisely monosilane (SiH4), to purge a tungsten deposition chamber after depositing WSix on semiconductor wafers using WF6 and DCS substantially reduces the short- and long-term downward drift in sheet resistance of the semiconductor wafers so processed.
      <br/>
      Using methods of the present invention, all benefits of the known DCS deposition processes are retained, with the additional benefit that the short- and long-term drifts in sheet resistance are reduced from about 5% to less than about 3%.
      <br/>
      Thus, semiconductor wafers processed according to the present invention display reduced variation in sheet resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="23">We have also unexpectedly discovered that, as a result of the inventive methods, stress in the deposited WSix film is significantly reduced.</p>
    <p num="24">
      Methods according to the invention can, if desired, be carried out employing conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) systems used to practice the known DCS processes, without the need for modifications to the vacuum deposition chamber.
      <br/>
      For example, a method of the invention can be carried out using the apparatus provided by Applied Materials, Inc. as described by Chang et al. in U.S. application Ser.

    <p num="25">
      However, the methods of the present invention are not to be considered to be confined in their application to the use of such apparatus.
      <br/>
      In particular, the methods of the present invention may be carried out using a multichamber processing system rather than a single chamber processing system.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring now to FIG. 1, a CVD system 10 comprises deposition chamber 12, vacuum exhaust system 14, gas combining assembly generally indicated at 16, diffuser 18, wafer lift 20, baffle plate 22, lift fingers 24 and susceptor lift 26.

      Gas combining assembly 16 can include a gas box or plenum and one or more valves for controlling the flow of the various process gases, including purge gases, carrier gases, reactive gases for deposition of WSix or other materials, and cleaning gases such as NF3 for periodic chamber cleaning processes.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, gas mixing assembly 16 may be omitted and all process gases delivered directly to chamber 12 via diffuser 18.
      <br/>
      This alternative may, however, result in greater non-uniformity and thus may be less preferred for certain applications.

    <p num="31">
      FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary gas combining assembly 16.
      <br/>
      Feed lines 38 and 40 deliver process gases into plenum 42 and subsequently into chamber 12 via diffuser 18.
      <br/>
      Feed lines 38 and 40 are linked by mixing lines 44 and 46, which in turn are joined by divert line 48.
      <br/>
      Valves 50 and 52 are disposed between mixing lines 44 and 46 on feed lines 38 and 40, respectively.
      <br/>
      Inlet mixing valves 54 and 56 are disposed on mixing line 44 as shown, and outlet mixing valves 58 and 60 are correspondingly disposed on mixing line 46.

      Divert valve 62 is disposed on divert line 48.

    <p num="32">
      Sources of process gases are connected to feed lines 38 and 40.
      <br/>
      Preferably, fluorine-containing gas sources are connected to one of feed lines 38 and 40, while silicon-containing gas sources are connected to the remaining feed line.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, WF6 source 64 and NF3 cleaning gas source 66 are connected to feed line 38 via supply valves 68 and 70, respectively.
      <br/>
      DCS source 72 and SiH4 source 74 similarly are connected to feed line 40 via supply valves 76 and 78, respectively.
      <br/>
      Noble gas source 80, which preferably is a source of argon, is connected to feed lines 38 via supply valve 82.

    <p num="33">When process gases are not flowing into chamber 12, the default settings of the various valves are as follows: valves 50 and 52 are open; all other valves are closed.</p>
    <p num="34">
      Returning to FIG. 1, the deposition process begins with the entry of process gases (i.e., reaction and carrier gases) into the deposition chamber 12 via gas combining assembly 16 and "showerhead" type diffuser 18.
      <br/>
      A conventional process mixture includes DCS, WF6 and argon.
      <br/>
      Gas combining assembly 16 mixes the process gases upstream of diffuser 18, ensuring that the gas mixture is of uniform composition before being supplied to the diffuser 18.
      <br/>
      The diffuser 18 has numerous openings over an area corresponding to that of the substrate 28 beneath it.
      <br/>
      The spacing between the diffuser 18 and the substrate 28 can be adjusted to from about 200-1000 mils (5-25 mm) to define the reaction zone 34.
      <br/>
      The diffuser 18 feeds the combined process gases to the reaction zone 34.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The area of the chamber below the plane of the susceptor 30 is purged via bottom purge line 88 with a noble gas, preferably argon, to prevent reactive gases from extending into the area of the chamber 12 below the susceptor 30.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The base pressure in the chamber is about 10 millitorr.
      <br/>
      Exhaust system 14 is fitted with a throttle valve 86 which can regulate the pressure of the chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In the illustrated embodiment of a method of the present invention, three gases, a noble carrier gas (e.g., argon), WF6 and DCS, are mixed in gas combining assembly 16.
      <br/>
      WF6 is introduced from source 64 into gas combining assembly 16 through feed line 38 by opening supply valve 68.
      <br/>
      The WF6 preferably is introduced into gas combining assembly 16 together with the noble carrier gas, which is delivered from source 80 by opening supply valve 82.
      <br/>
      Oichlorosilane from source 72 is introduced into gas combining assembly 16 through feed line 40 by opening supply valve 76.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The noble carrier gas preferred herein for reasons of economy is argon, but other noble gases can also be used.
      <br/>
      As mentioned above, nitrogen should not be used in accordance with the present process and should be excluded from the process.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Mixing of the process gases is effected in gas combining assembly 16 by closing valves 50 and 52 and outlet mixing valves 58 and 60, and opening inlet mixing valves 54 and 56 and divert valve 62.
      <br/>
      The gases partially mix in mixing line 44, and initially flow through divert line 48 to exhaust system 14 until the flow is stabilized.
      <br/>
      After stabilization, divert valve 62 is closed and outlet mixing valves 58 and 60 are opened.
      <br/>
      The partially mixed gases return through mixing line 44 to feed lines 38 and 40, then enter plenum 42 where mixing is completed.
      <br/>
      The mixed process gases subsequently enter chamber 12 via diffuser 18.
    </p>
    <p num="40">The tungsten silicide deposition is generally carried out at from about 500-600 (degree)  C., preferably at about 550 (degree)  C. The pressure during deposition can be from about 0.3-10 torr, but preferably is carried out at about 0.7-1.5 torr.</p>
    <p num="41">
      In a typical process, the flowrates of process gases into chamber 12 are related to the volume of the chamber.
      <br/>
      For an exemplary apparatus including a chamber adapted to process a semiconductor wafer having a diameter of 8" (200 mm), a typical chamber volume is about 6 L. A semiconductor wafer having a diameter of 6" (150 mm) can also be processed in a chamber of this volume.
      <br/>
      For such an apparatus, an appropriate flowrate of WF6 is about 1-6 sccm, preferably about 3.5 sccm.
      <br/>
      Dichlorosilane is passed into chamber 12 at a flowrate of about 130-300 sccm, preferably at about 175 sccm.
      <br/>
      Argon is used as the carrier gas and is passed into chamber 12 via line 38 at a flowrate of about 100-1000 sccm, preferably at 300-600 sccm.
      <br/>
      This argon flowrate is exclusive of the bottom purge flowrate, about 100-500 sccm, preferably about 300 sccm.
      <br/>
      The various flowrates are adjusted so as to obtain a WSix layer having a resistivity of between 700 and 1400  MU  OMEGA -cm, preferably about 800  MU  OMEGA -cm.
      <br/>
      Deposition is most preferably carried out at 550 (degree)  C. and 1 torr.

    <p num="42">
      After the deposition process is completed, but before the SiH4 purge step is initiated, it is preferred to carry out an optional partial purge step using DCS.
      <br/>
      The optional DCS purge step is carried out by simply closing supply valve 68 to stop the flow of WF6 into the deposition chamber 12, while maintaining the previously established flow of DCS and argon into chamber 12.
      <br/>
      The optional DCS purge is carried out for 0 to about 5 seconds, preferably about 2-3 seconds.
      <br/>
      The DCS flowrate during this optional purge step is about 130 to 300 sccm, preferably about 175 sccm.
      <br/>
      Preferred temperatures are as indicated for the deposition step.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The optional DCS purge helps to remove any remaining WF6 from gas combining assembly 16.

      All mixing valves 54, 56, 58 and 60 are closed, and both valves 50 and 52 are opened.
      <br/>
      Supply valve 78 is opened, allowing SiH4 to flow from source 74.
      <br/>
      Supply valve 82 preferably remains open, continuing the flow of argon from source 80.

      Argon preferably also continues to flow into deposition chamber 12 through bottom purge line 88.

      <br/>
      The flowrate of SiH4 into deposition chamber 12 preferably is about 100 to 500 sccm, more preferably about 300 sccm, assuming a chamber volume of about 6 L. Chamber pressure during the conditioning step is preferably about 1 to 10 torr, more preferably about 2 torr.

    <p num="62">The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.</p>
    <p num="63">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="64">
      In the example, two 8" semiconductor wafers were deposited with layers of WSix.
      <br/>
      The first wafer was processed according to a conventional silane method without a silane cap.
      <br/>
      The second wafer was processed according to a DCS method with preceding SiH4 soak and subsequent SiH4 capping steps according to the present invention, as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Initially, the wafer was introduced into a 6 L vacuum deposition chamber, and SiH4 (300 sccm) was introduced into the chamber together with argon (300 sccm) as carrier.
      <br/>
      The bottom of the chamber was simultaneously purged with argon (300 sccm).
      <br/>
      The SiH4 soak step was carried out for 30 sec at 2 torr.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Subsequently, the wafer was heated to 565 (degree)  C. in the chamber.
      <br/>
      WF6 (3.5 sccm), DCS (175 sccm) and argon (600 sccm) were introduced into the chamber via a diffuser.
      <br/>
      The bottom of the chamber was purged with argon (300 sccm).
      <br/>
      Chamber pressure was 0.8 torr.
      <br/>
      WSix deposition was carried out for 110 seconds.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      After the deposition was completed, a silane capping step was carried out for 15 seconds.
      <br/>
      The total process time was 3 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Stresses in the WSix film on each wafer are then determined using a Tencor FLX-2908 thin-film stress measurement instrument (available from Tencor Instruments).
      <br/>
      Each wafer is heated in a nitrogen atmosphere to a temperature of 900 (degree)  C. over the course of 6 hours.
      <br/>
      The wafers are held at 900 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes, then gradually cooled to room temperature (25 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      Stress in each film was determined during both heating and cooling.
      <br/>
      Results are given in FIGS. 3 and 4, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Comparison of FIGS. 3 and 4 shows the unexpected improvement in film stress achieved according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The exemplary film produced according to the inventive process shows significantly lower stress than does a comparison film formed according to the previously known DCS process over a range of temperatures including the range (about 500-600 (degree)  C.) in which the deposition process typically is carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      More particularly, WSix films produced according to both the known and the inventive methods exhibit hysteresis in the stress measured during film annealing and subsequent cooling.
      <br/>
      In the exemplary film produced according to the invention (FIG. 4), the stress as determined during heating is lower than the stress determined during cooling over the temperature range from about room temperature to about 600 (degree)  C. Stress varied slightly between about 400 (degree)  and 600 (degree)  C. In the comparison film of FIG. 3, the stress as determined during heating becomes higher than that determined during cooling at about 200 (degree)  C., and remains higher up to at temperature of about 675 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="71">The exemplary film of FIG. 4 also differs from the comparison film of FIG. 3 in that the film stress exhibits a negative value over a range of temperatures from about 400 to about 500 (degree)  C. That is, the exemplary film exhibits compression rather than tension over the foregoing temperature range, while the comparison film always exhibits tension.</p>
    <p num="72">
      The exemplary film exhibits a local maximum in stress at about 600 (degree)  C. similarly to the comparison film.
      <br/>
      However, in the exemplary film, the measured stress at this temperature is much lower than the stress in the comparison film.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, both the rate of change in stress and the total reduction in stress shown by the comparison film during heating in the temperature range above about 600 (degree)  C. are much greater than those shown by the exemplary film.
      <br/>
      That is, the exemplary film shows a much smoother transition in stress in this temperature range.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, we believe that the behavior of films produced according to the invention may be explained as follows.
      <br/>
      WSix films are mixtures of two phases, hexagonal and tetragonal.
      <br/>
      During annealing, as the temperature is increased over the range from about 400 (degree)  C. to 700 (degree)  C., the hexagonal phase transforms into the tetragonal phase.
      <br/>
      By about 900 (degree)  C., the films are comprised substantially completely of the tetragonal phase.
      <br/>
      From this point, whether produced by conventional methods or methods according to the invention, WSix films will behave similarly on cooling.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Stress in the films is observed to decrease on heating until the transitional temperature range is reached, at which point stress begins to increase as the phase transition begins.
      <br/>
      In films produced according to methods of the invention, the stresses at the beginning of the annealing process are much lower than the stresses in films produced according to prior art processes.
      <br/>
      The stresses remain significantly lower than the stresses in the prior art films during pre-transition heating, as shown, and can assume zero or even negative (compressive) values in this regime, although negative values will not necessarily be realized in every film produced according to the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      It is believed that the reduction in stress shown by films produced in accordance with methods of the invention may be accomplished as follows.
      <br/>
      The processed semiconductor wafers remain in the chamber while SiH4 purges the chamber.
      <br/>
      SiH4 reacts with residual tungsten atoms present on the surface of the wafers, and with residual WF6, thus forming a silicon-rich WSix layer having a thickness of approximately 1-2  Angstrom  on top of the layer formed during the DCS deposition process (hence the alternate reference to the SiH4 purge step as a "cap" step).
      <br/>
      The reaction adds silicon to the films at the grain boundaries of the films and fills pores in the films, thus releasing stress in the films.
      <br/>
      It is further believed that the SiH4 purge may actually result in a slight increase in sheet resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="76">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="77">
      Sheet resistance was measured in semiconductor wafers processed according to the conventional and inventive processes described in Example 1, above.
      <br/>
      The value of the sheet resistance was measured at 49 different sites over the surface of the wafers, and the average value and standard deviation of the measured values were calculated.
      <br/>
      The standard deviation is denoted herein as the "uniformity" of the sheet resistance.
      <br/>
      A high "uniformity" value thus indicates a large variation of sheet resistance from site to site over the surface of the wafer.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      FIGS. 6A and 6B show the short-term drift in sheet resistance, measured in  OMEGA /square (.diamond.). and uniformity (.quadrature.) in %, over 25 wafers for the conventional process and the inventive process, respectively.
      <br/>
      Sheet resistance as measured for the conventional process varied from 31 to 29  OMEGA /square, for a decrease of about 2  OMEGA /square (about 6.5%).
      <br/>
      For the inventive process, the sheet resistance varied from 44.4 to 44.6  OMEGA /square, within experimental error.
      <br/>
      Uniformity for the conventional process varied from about 1.7% to 2.4%; for the inventive process, the variation was from about 1.83% to 1.75%. As is apparent, the inventive process affords significantly reduced short-term downward drift in sheet resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      FIGS. 6C and 6D show corresponding long-term drifts in sheet resistance and uniformity over 500 wafers for the conventional process and the inventive process, respectively.
      <br/>
      Sheet resistance was measured for the first wafer in each batch of 25 wafers.
      <br/>
      After 25 wafers were processes, the vacuum deposition chamber was cleaned, and the process was repeated for the next 25 wafers.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      For the conventional process, sheet resistance varied from 31 to 27  OMEGA /square, for a decrease of about 4  OMEGA /square (about 13%).
      <br/>
      For the inventive process, the sheet resistance varied from 44.5 to 43  OMEGA /square, for a decrease of about 1.5  OMEGA /square (about 3%).
      <br/>
      Uniformity for the conventional process was observed to increase from about 2% to 3.5%; for the inventive process, the variation was from about 1% to 1.8%, with no trend upward or downward observed.
      <br/>
      The inventive process thus affords significantly reduced long-term downward drift in sheet resistance as compared to the conventional process, as well as improved uniformity.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      Furthermore, after 500 wafers the conventional process required an upward adjustment of the pressure during deposition, to about 1.2 torr, in order to produce deposited films having acceptable sheet resistance.
      <br/>
      No such upward adjustment was required in the inventive process.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Although the invention has been illustrated primarily with reference to a DCS deposition process, the invention is not limited in its applicability to DCS processes or processes which deposit WSix on a substrate.
      <br/>
      The SiH4 conditioning and purge steps can be used with other deposition processes, particularly those which deposit a crystalline material on a substrate.
      <br/>
      Such materials include, for example, TiSix, CoSix, TiCoSix, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Processing semiconductor wafers in accordance with the present invention results in a significant reduction in short- and long-term downward drift in sheet resistance, and enables production of more uniform wafers.
      <br/>
      The present invention in addition results in processed semiconductor wafers having significantly reduced film stress.
