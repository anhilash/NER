    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Glycyrrhetinic Acid (GA), the active principal in liquorice root, has been shown to markedly inhibit 11 BETA -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 BETA -OHSD) and steroid 5 BETA -reductase when incubated with these enzymes (Stewart, P. M. et al. (1987) Lancet 2:821-823; Monder, C. et al. (1989) Endocrinology 125:1046-1053; Latif, S. A. et al. (1990) Steroids 55:52-58).
      <br/>
      The importance of both these enzymes has become apparent following the experiments of Ulick, New, Monder and co-workers (Ulick, S. et al. (1979) J. Clin. Endocrin. Metab. 49:747-764; New, M. I. et al. (1982) Endocrinology of Hypertension, Serono Symposium, vol. 50, pp 85-101; Monder, C. et al. (1986) J. Clin. Endocrin. Metab. 63:550-557) who demonstrated that hypertensive children with the syndrome of apparent mineralocorti-coid excess (AME) lack both 11 BETA -OHSD and 5 BETA -reductase activity.
      <br/>
      Alteration in these enzymatic pathways of steroid inactivation was shown to result in changes in the peripheral metabolism of cortisol.
      <br/>
      It has been postulated that higher peripheral and intrarenal concentrations of cortisol may then interact with mineralocorticoid receptors and promote sodium reabsorption (Edwards, C. R. W. et al. (1988) Lancet 2:986-989; Funder, J. W. et al. (1988) Science 242:583-585).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      AME patients exhibit sodium retention, potassium wasting, and increased blood pressure without measurably increased circulating aldosterone.
      <br/>
      A pharmacological equivalent of this congenital condition results from the ingestion of liquorice which contains glycoside derivatives of GA (Stewart, P. M. et al. (1987) Lancet 2:821-823; Edwards, C. R. W. et al. (1988) Lancet 2:986-989).
      <br/>
      Because of the importance of these enzymes, it is possible that other categories of hypertension may also result from less extreme alterations of their activities.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      This invention pertains to an endogenous human glycyrrhetinic-acid-like factor(s) or GALF(s) which inhibits hepatic and renal 11 BETA -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 BETA -OHSD) and hepatic 5 BETA -steroid reductase (5 BETA -SR).
      <br/>

      Measurement of this factor will be useful for identification of individuals, particularly those with hypertension, who have altered enzymatic pathways for the inactivation of steroid hormones, such as cortisol and aldosterone, and may have a steroid component to, and which may be responsible for, their hypertension.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      Urine from normotensive individuals contains at least two substances, or groups of substances, designated glycyrrhetinic-acid-like factor(s) or GALF(s), which markedly inhibit cytosolic 5 BETA -SR and microsomal 11 BETA -OHSD.
      <br/>
      These substances are referred to herein as 11 BETA -GALF for substance(s) active against 11 BETA -OHSD and 5 BETA -GALF for substance(s) active against 5 BETA -SR.
      <br/>
      The presence of GALF factors was found in urines collected from individuals with congestive heart failure (CHF) and mild essential hypertension.
      <br/>
      In these individuals, there are increased amounts of both 11 BETA - and 5 BETA -GALF(s) compared to normotensive individuals.
      <br/>
      The majority of the GALF factor(s) is water soluble and is not extractable from aqueous solution into ethyl acetate, indicating that it does not consist of "free" urinary steroids such as cortisol, which would compete as a substrate in both enzyme reactions.
      <br/>
      In addition, the GALF factor(s) is heat stable, is resistant to trypsin digestion and does not react with ninhydrin.
      <br/>
      The factor(s) can be reproducibly resolved by gradient high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) into at least two peaks which possess inhibitory activity.
      <br/>
      The characteristics of this material are described in detail in the exemplification below.
      <br/>
      The chemical structure of the isolated factor(s) can be ascertained by standard techniques such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Similar levels of the glycyrrhetinic-acid-like factor are present in urine from normotensive males and non-pregnant females but significantly higher quantities were present in urine of females in the second and third trimester of pregnancy.
      <br/>
      Despite differences in levels, the chromatographic profiles and other chemical properties were similar in all three groups.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The factor(s) of this invention are non-glycyrrhetinic-acid substances which inhibit enzymes involved in steroid degradation.
      <br/>
      Determining levels of the factor(s) may be useful for identification of individuals who have altered enzymatic pathways for the inactivation of steroid hormones such as mineral-ocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone) and glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol).
      <br/>
      The levels of this factor(s) may be particularly important in hypertensives where altered levels of steroid degradation may be linked to hypertension.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The factor(s) can be assayed in biological fluids by immunochemical means using antibodies against the factor(s).
      <br/>
      Antibody against the factor(s) can be made by standard procedures.
      <br/>
      In general, the factor(s) is administered as an immunogen to an animal to generate an antibody response.
      <br/>
      If haptenic, it can be coupled to an appropriate carrier.
      <br/>
      Antibody can be harvested from the immunized animal as antiserum.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, monoclonal antibodies can be prepared by obtaining antibody producing cells (e.g., B-lymphocytes) from the immunized animal, fusing the antibody cells with immortalizing cells (e.g., myeloma cells) to produce hybridomas and screening the hybridomas for those that produce antibody against the factor(s).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The immunochemical assays can be competitive or immunometric (e.g., radiometric or enzymetric).
      <br/>
      In a competitive assay, for example, an antibody is reacted with a constant amount of labeled antigen and varying amounts of unlabeled antigen to produce a standard antibody-antigen binding curve.
      <br/>
      The sample is incubated with the antibody in the presence of the labeled antigen.
      <br/>
      Antibody bound antigen is separated from unbound antigen.
      <br/>
      The amount of labeled antigen bound by antibody is indicative of the amount of antigen (GALF) in the sample.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In a sandwich immunoactive assay, an antibody (in excess) is contacted with sample to capture antigen.
      <br/>
      Bound and unbound antigen are separated.
      <br/>
      Bound antigen is then determined by reacting a second antibody (which is either labeled or capable of being labeled).
      <br/>
      Bound antigen is directly proportional to the amount of antigen in the sample.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Solid phase formats of the immunochemical assays are preferred.
      <br/>
      Reagents for performance of the assays can be provided in the form of kits.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The invention is illustrated further by the following exemplification.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE I</heading>
    <p num="15">Materials and Methods</p>
    <p num="16">Urine Samples</p>
    <p num="17">
      Random urine samples were donated by non-hypertensive male and female members of the laboratory and samples from healthy pregnant women on routine visits to their obstetrician.
      <br/>
      Urine samples were frozen until used.
      <br/>
      After thawing aliquots were centrifuged to remove any debris or precipitate and samples were assayed for their creatinine contents using a Beckman CX3 Analyser.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      10 ml samples of the centrifuged urine were then passed onto previously activated Waters C18 SepPaks (Waters Chromatography Division, Millipore Corp., Milford, Mass.) and were eluted first with 5 mls of water, which removed salts, proteins, and other strongly polar components, followed by 5 mls of 100% HPLC grade methanol.
      <br/>
      Preliminary experiments had shown that no "inhibitory" activity was lost in the initial water eluate.
      <br/>
      The methanol eluates were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and then redissolved in 2 mls of distilled water to give a five-fold concentration of the original sample.
      <br/>
      Samples processed in this manner are referred to as `Urine Samples` in the rest of this exemplification.
    </p>
    <p num="19">HPLC Gradient Separation of Components of Urine Samples</p>
    <p num="20">
      2 ml urine samples with a 30% methanol content were chromatographed on a 25 * 0.5 cm C18 5 mm reverse phase column (Isco Corp. Omaha, Nebr.).
      <br/>
      Components were eluted with a non-linear methanol/water gradient commencing with 30% methanol which increased linearly to 40% methanol at 400 secs.; 60% methanol at 1900 secs.; and 100% methanol at 2000 secs. 1 ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.
      <br/>
      The absorbance at 240 nm was monitored as a guide to the number of components present.
      <br/>
      Following separation, the 1 ml fractions were assayed for their "inhibitory" activity using the radio-enzymatic assay methods described below.
      <br/>
      Samples with marked "inhibitory" effect were also spotted onto Whatman filter paper, dried and sprayed with ninhydrin to detect the presence of peptides or other amines or sugar amines.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Modification of Urine Samples</p>
    <p num="22">Heat</p>
    <p num="23">
      Urine samples (pH 7.4) were heated at 100 (degree)  C. for 10 mins.
      <br/>
      Both heated and unheated samples were then assayed for inhibitory activity.

    <p num="24">Assay of "Inhibitory" Activity</p>
    <p num="25">
      Details of methods for the radioenzymatic assay of 5 BETA -steroid reductase and 11 BETA -OHSD, by measuring the conversion of �1,2-3 H� aldosterone to 3a,5 BETA -tetrahydroaldosterone for the first of these and the conversion of �1,2-3 H� corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone for the latter have been previously described (Monder, C. et al. (1989) Endocrinology 125:1046-1053; Latif, S. A. et al (1990) Steroids 55:52-58). �1,2-3 H�-aldosterone and �1,2-3 H�-corticosterone with specific activities of 53.9 Ci/mmol and 56.4 Ci/mmol, respectively, were obtained from Dupont New England Nuclear (Boston, Mass.).
      <br/>
      Their purity was checked by HPLC before use.
      <br/>
      Methanol (HPLC-grade) was obtained from Fisher Scientific (Medford, Mass.).
      <br/>
      Dihydronicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), Trizma base (tris-hydroxymethyl-amminomethane), NADP+, glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), corticosterone (Compound B) and 11 BETA  dehydrocorticosterone (Compound A) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.) and aldosterone was obtained from Andard Mount (London, UK).
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Both enzymes were prepared in crude form from the livers of normal adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.).
      <br/>
      Following sacrifice, the livers were rapidly removed, washed carefully with ice cold 0.25 M sucrose and microsomal and cytosolic fractions were prepared for measurements of 11 BETA -OHSD and 5 BETA -reductase enzymatic activities respectively as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Livers were homogenized in 0.25 M sucrose (1:4 wt/vol) using a Teflon homogenizer and subcellular fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation at 4 C. using a Sorvall RC-2 preparative and Beckman L8-80 ultracentrifuge.
      <br/>
      The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 * g for 10 mins. and the resultant supernatant from this and subsequent spins were recentrifuged first for 10 mins. at 10,000 * g and then at 17,000 * g, respectively.
      <br/>
      The 17,000 * g supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 * g for 70 mins. and the microsomal pellet was rinsed with cold homogenization medium and resuspended in cold 0.25 M sucrose at a concentration of 30 mg protein/ml.
      <br/>
      The final supernatant is the liver cytosol preparation containing 5 BETA -reductase (Latif, S. A. et at. (1990) Steroids 55:52-58) and the microsomal pellet is the source of 11 BETA -OHSD activity (Monder, C. et al. (1989) Endocrinology 125:1046-1053).
    </p>
    <p num="28">Enzyme Assays</p>
    <p num="29">11 BETA -OHSD Assay</p>
    <p num="30">
      0.14 mg of liver microsomal fraction was incubated at 37 (degree)  C. for 10 mins. with 2 mM non-radioactive corticosterone and 3 H-corticosterone (1 mC) as tracer in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 3.4 mM NADP+ in a total volume of 0.5 ml. Included in this volume is an aliquot either of water, in the case of controls, or of the aqueous extract from SepPak treated urine whose inhibitory activity is being measured.
      <br/>
      The enzymatic reaction was terminated by addition of 2 ml methanol.
      <br/>
      Synthesis of 11-dehydro-corticosterone was quantitated by HPLC as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="31">5 BETA -Reductase Assay</p>
    <p num="32">
      Aliquots of cytosol were incubated with 5 mM aldosterone and 1 mCi of �3 H�-aldosterone in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 2.76 mM NADPH and 2% ethanol in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Again, appropriate aliquots of water and urine samples were added.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 (degree)  C. for 10 mins. and again terminated by the addition of 2 ml methanol.
      <br/>
      Synthesis of 3a,5 BETA -tetrahydroaldosterone was quantitated by HPLC as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="33">Estimation of Enzyme Activity</p>
    <p num="34">
      The methanol extracts of the incubation media were centrifuged at 1000 * g for 10 mins. 0.5 ml aliquots of supernatant were evaporated to dryness under N2, dissolved in 20% MeOH and chromatographed on a Dupont Zorbax C8 reversed-phase column, at 44 (degree)  C. with 45 % aqueous-methanol (isocratic) at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min.
      <br/>
      This system separated both Compound B from Compound A and also aldosterone from 3a,5 BETA -tetrahydroaldosterone.
      <br/>
      The radioactive metabolite peaks were detected by an on-line  BETA -detection system (model LB-504, Berthold Instrument, Nashua, N.H.) after mixing of the HPLC column eluate with scintillation fluid (Ultima-Gold, Packard Instruments, Downers Grove, Ill.) with a 10% counting efficiency under conditions of flow.
      <br/>
      Following substraction of background radioactivity, the percentage distribution of radioactivity among all HPLC peaks in each chromatogram was determined.
      <br/>
      The enzyme activity was then calculated and expressed either as nmol or ng of product made/10 mins.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Calculation of Inhibition</p>
    <p num="36">
      Inhibition was calculated in two ways.
      <br/>
      In the case of aliquots from the HPLC gradient separations inhibition was calculated as the percentage reduction in apparent enzyme activity in the test sample as compared with the control.
      <br/>
      Samples of whole urine yielded similar data but the results were also expressed as `GA equivalent` units.
      <br/>
      For this purpose aliquots of GA were added to the incubation mixtures at varying concentrations up to 10 mM and the degree of inhibition calculated.
      <br/>
      From this data a GA inhibitory standard curve could be plotted and the `GA equivalent` units contained in the test sample of urine calculated.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Results</p>
    <p num="38">Measurement of Total Urinary "Inhibitory" Activity</p>
    <p num="39">
      The aim of these experiments was to investigate whether GALF factor(s) can be detected and measured in human urine.
      <br/>
      Random urines were obtained from 5 males, 7 from non-pregnant females and 9 from females in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
      <br/>
      Aliquots of urine from these subjects were measured for their abilities to inhibit the two enzymes, 5 BETA -reductase and 11 BETA -OHSD.
      <br/>
      Known amounts of GA (0.1-10 mM) standards were also added to control incubation mixtures to define two standard "inhibition" curves related to the % inhibition of each of the enzymes.
      <br/>
      From these results, and the initial urinary creatinine measurements, we have expressed the "inhibitory" activity as mg equivalents of GA per mg of creatinine, (5 BETA -GA-Units and 11 BETA -GA-Units, respectively) in each urine sample.
    </p>
    <p num="40">The "inhibitory" material(s) in each urine sample were extracted using SepPak C18 Bondapak, following desalting with H2 O. Using the hepatic cytosolic 5 BETA -reductase radioenzymatic assay which measures the fraction of �3 H�-aldosterone converted to �3 H�-3a,5 BETA  tetrahydroaldosterone, the "inhibitory" activity ranged from 1.0 to 2.1 5 BETA -GA-Units (mean=1.48) for males; from 1.4 to 2.1 5 BETA -GA-Units for non-pregnant females; from 3.7 to 10.9 5 BETA -GA-Units for second trimester pregnant females; and from 10.3 to 31.0 5 BETA -GA-Units for third trimester pregnant females (Table 1).</p>
    <p num="41">Using the hepatic microsomal 11 BETA -OHSD radioenzymatic assay which measures the proportion of �3 H�-Compound B converted to �3 H�-Compound A the "inhibitory" activity was from 0.07 to 0.22 (mean=0.15) 11 BETA -GA-Units for males; from 0.11 to 0.36 (mean=0.23) 11 BETA -GA-Units for non-pregnant females; and from 0.39 to 0.55 (mean=0.43) 11 BETA -GA-Units in the second trimester and from 0.44 to 1.09 (mean=0.72) 11 BETA -GA-Units in the third trimester (Table 1).</p>

(1990) Steroids 55:52-58). �1,2-3 H�-Aldosterone (Aldo) and �1,2-3 H�-Corticosterone with specific activities of 53.9 Ci/mmol and 56.4 Ci/mmol, respectively were obtained from Dupont New England Nuclear (Boston, Mass.).
      <br/>
      Their purity was checked by HPLC before use.

    <p num="74">Calculation of Inhibition</p>
    <p num="75">
      To provide a basis for the quantitation of urine "inhibitory" activity, aliquots of GA were added to control incubation mixtures (volume 0.25 ml) in varying amounts (0-1.2  MU g for 5 BETA -reductase and 0-0.012  MU g for 11 BETA -OHSD) and percent inhibition was calculated relative to controls (without GA) as previously described.
      <br/>
      Briefly, percent inhibition due to urine extract was converted to  MU g GA (GA equivalent units) using the appropriate GA standard curve.
      <br/>
      These GA equivalent units were expressed as  MU g GA/mg creatinine to normalize them for dilute or concentrated urine.
      <br/>
      Note that because of the different values of Ki for GA inhibition of 5 BETA -reductase and 11 BETA -OHSD, and because the two enzymes were measured in two different bioassay systems, the magnitude of the GALF units is different for the two enzymes.
      <br/>
      Therefore, we designate them as 5 BETA -GALF Units and 11 BETA -GALF Units.

      FIGS. 4 and 5, showing urinary 11 BETA -GALF and 5 BETA -GALF activity in essential hypertension, present a different picture.
      <br/>
      There is signifcant increase (p&lt;0.01) in urinary 5 BETA -GALF in the hypertensive group as compared with the normotensive group (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      By contrast, there is no statistically significant difference between the urinary 11 BETA -GALF levels in essential hypertension as compared with the control group.
      <br/>
      However, the scatter of the results from hypertensive patients is much greater than the scatter for normotensive (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      In particular, there are elevated outliers which suggest the possibility that there may be a specific subset of essential hypertensives who may indeed consistently excrete elevated levels of both 5 BETA - and 11 BETA -GALFs in their urine.

    <p num="81">Discussion</p>
    <p num="82">
      Diminished activity of the enzyme 11 BETA -OHSD leading to decreased rates of inactivation of cortisol to cortisone has been suggested to account for the increased Na+ retention, hypokalemia and increased B.P. in patients with AME (Ulick, S. et al. (1979) J. Clin. Endocrinol.
      <br/>
      Metab. 49:747-764; New, M.I. (1982) In: Mantero, F., Biglieri C., Edwards, C. R. W. (eds): Endocrinology of Hypertension.
      <br/>
      Serono Symposium 50:85-101).
      <br/>
      These patients were also shown to have decreased 5 BETA -SR activity (Monder, C. et al. (1986) J. Clin. Endocrin. Metab. 63:550-557).
      <br/>
      Ingestion of liquorice, which is also associated with similar clinical features, also leads to lower activities of both these enzymes (Stewart, P. M. et al. (1987) Lancet 2:821-823).
      <br/>
      Since in vitro, glucocorticoids have equal affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors as mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone but do not normally activate these receptors in vivo, 11 BETA -OHSD-mediated inactivation of cortisol and corticosterone has been suggested to play a major role in protecting mineralocorticoid receptors from glucocorticoids and thereby regulating electrolyte balance and blood pressure (Edwards, C. R. W. et al. (1988) Lancet 2:986-989; Funder, J. W. et al (1988) Science 242:583-585).
      <br/>
      As described herein, urine from normotensive males and females contains measurable levels of 11 BETA -GALF and 5 BETA -GALF, and that both of these increase significantly throughout pregnancy with its marked changes in electrolyte and water homeostasis.
      <br/>
      The levels of 11 BETA -GALF and 5 BETA -GALF were determined in the urines of patients with CHF and essential hypertension.
      <br/>
      In these experiments, one patient with essential hypertension and another with CHEF were chosen.
      <br/>
      All patients with CHF showed consistent and marked increases in their urinary output of both 11 BETA - and 5 BETA -GALF output.
      <br/>
      The hypertensive group had had their medication withheld for 8 weeks.
      <br/>
      These patients all had increased levels of 5 BETA -GALF activity both in terms of their concentration in the urine and also the total amount excreted in the 24 hr. urine samples.
      <br/>
      However, only a small number of these patients, possibly a physiological subset of this group also showed increases in the concentration and total amount of 11 BETA -GALF excreted in their 24 hr. urine samples.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      The present experiments indicate that two additional groups of patients in which increased mineralocorticoid activity might be necessary to maintain electrolyte and water balance.
      <br/>
      Increasing the half-lifes of both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids by inhibiting their catabolic enzymes might provide such increased mineralocorticoid activity.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      The studies described herein demonstrate that GALF substance(s) can be reproducibly measured and which may represent undescribed endogenous factor(s) involved in the regulation of steroid metabolism.
      <br/>
      These factors may affect the extent of (a) 11 BETA -hydroxy oxidation by 11 BETA -OHSD and/or (b) Ring A-reduction by 5 BETA -SR of cortisol and possibly other adrenal steroid hormones.
      <br/>
      The results described herein may provide an explanation for previously observed alterations in the urinary metabolite tetrahydrocortisol/tetrahydrocortisone ratios in essential hypertensives (Lewicka, S. et al. (1991) N.Y. Acad. Sci. 595:435-440; Walker, B. R. and Edwards, C. R. W. (1991) In: Edwards C. R. W. and Lincoln, D. W. (eds): Recent Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism 4:21-32; Kornel, L. and Margolis, E. (1992) Abstract 04.31.023 IXth. International Congress of Endocrinology, Nice), and changes in the plasma half-life of 11 ALPHA -3 H-cortisol in these patients (Walker, B. R. and Edwards, C. R. W. (1991) In: Edwards C. R. W. and Lincoln, D. W. (eds): Recent Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism 4:21-32), suggestive of 11 BETA -OHSD deficiency, in patients with essential hypertension.
      <br/>
      The presence of GALFs in these patient may be linked to changes in the handling of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids in many sites, including liver and kidney.
      <br/>
      Additional evidence for such a concept is provided by the demonstration that treatment of adrenalectomized male rats with carbenoxolone sodium, a succinate derivative of GA, caused the glucocorticoids of corticosterone and cortisol to display minearlocorticoid like activity (Souness, G. W. and Morris, D. J. (1989) Endocrinology 124:1588-1590) and also amplified the Na+ retaining properties of the minearlocorticoids aldosterone and deoxycorticosterone (Morris, D. J. and Souness, G. W. (1990) Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Fluid Electrolyte Physiol.) 258:F756-F759).
    </p>
    <p num="85">In conclusion, the results described herein indicate that endogenous factors produced in excess by patients with essential hypertension may alter corticosteroid metabolism thus amplifying tissue sensitivity to cortisol and perhaps also to aldosterone and deoxycorticosterone and contributing to the elevation of blood pressure in these patients.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE III</heading>
    <p num="86">
      Various endogenous substances which bear similar structural resemblances to glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) were screened for inhibitory activity against 11 BETA -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 BETA -OHSD) and 5 BETA -reductase (5 BETA -R).
      <br/>
      Among the compounds screened 3 ALPHA ,5 BETA -tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (3 ALPHA ,5 BETA -THDOC) was the most potent inhibitor of both 11 BETA -OHSD and 5 BETA -R.
      <br/>
      Of the bile acids tested, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was the most potent inhibitor of both 11 BETA -OHSD and 5 BETA -R.
      <br/>
      Although lithocholic acid (LCA) was a potent inhibitor and cholic acid (CA) a moderate inhibitor of 11 BETA -OHSD, both bile acids were weak inhibitors of 5 BETA -R, whereas deoxycholic acid (DCA) was a moderate inhibitor of 5 BETA -R but a weak inhibitor of 11 BETA -OHSD.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      3 ALPHA ,5 BETA -THDOC and bile acids were also treated to determine whether, like GA, they could confer mineralocorticoid (MC) actions upon corticosterone.
      <br/>
      In adrenalectomized rats pretreated with CDCA, corticosterone caused a significant antinatriuresis; this effect was blocked by the antimineralocorticoid, RU28318.
      <br/>
      Thus, there appears to be three structurally similar endogenous substances, 3 ALPHA ,5 BETA -THDOC, CDCA and LCA, which inhibit both 11 BETA -OHSD and 5 BETA -R activity, and one of which (CDCA) can confer mineralocorticoid actions upon the glucocorticoid, corticosterone.
