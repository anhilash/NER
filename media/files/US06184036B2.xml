    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention is in the field of plant molecular biology.
      <br/>
      More specifically, this invention pertains to nucleic acid fragments encoding ornithine biosynthetic enzymes in plants and seeds.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Ornithine is converted into arginine in the urea cycle.
      <br/>
      Intermediaries in the ornithine biosynthesis pathway are important in other steps of this cycle.
      <br/>
      Amino acid N-acetyl transferase (EC 2.3.1.1) catalyzes the first reaction in a pathway that leads to the synthesis of ornithine from L-glutamate giving N-acetylglutamate as its intermediary product.
      <br/>
      Amino acid N-acetyl transferase is also known as N-acetylglutamate synthetase (AGS) and is encoded by the argA locus in bacteria.
      <br/>
      No plant N-acetylglutamate has been described to date.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Carbamoyl phosphate synthase I, the mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step of the urea cycle, is allosterically activated by N-acetyl glutamate.
      <br/>
      The rate of urea production by the liver is, in fact, correlated with the N-acetylglutamate concentration.
      <br/>
      Increased urea synthesis is required when amino acid breakdown rates increase, generating excess nitrogen that must be extracted.
      <br/>
      Increase in these breakdown rates are signaled by an increase in glutamate concentration through transamination reaction.
      <br/>
      This situation, in turn, causes an increase in N-acetylglutamate synthesis, stimulating carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and the entire urea cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Ornithine oxo-acid transaminase (EC 2.6.1.13), also called omithine aminotransferase, catalyzes the conversion of omithine to L-glutamate semialdehyde.
      <br/>
      The gene encoding ornithine oxo-acid transaminase has been cloned from Aspergillus nidulans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Plasmodiumfalciparum, Vigna aconitifolia, rat, mouse and man.
      <br/>
      No plant sequences encoding omithine oxo-acid transaminase have been described to date.

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      In the context of this disclosure, a number of terms shall be utilized.
      <br/>
      As used herein, a "nucleic acid fragment" is a polymer of RNA or DNA that is single- or double-stranded, optionally containing synthetic, non-natural or altered nucleotide bases.
      <br/>
      A nucleic acid fragment in the form of a polymer of DNA may be comprised of one or more segments of cDNA, genomic DNA or synthetic DNA.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      As used herein, "contig" refers to a nucleotide sequence that is assembled from two or more constituent nucleotide sequences that share common or overlapping regions of sequence homology.
      <br/>
      For example, the nucleotide sequences of two or more nucleic acid fragments can be compared and aligned in order to identify common or overlapping sequences.
      <br/>
      Where common or overlapping sequences exist between two or more nucleic acid fragments, the sequences (and thus their corresponding nucleic acid fragments) can be assembled into a single contiguous nucleotide sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As used herein, "substantially similar" refers to nucleic acid fragments wherein changes in one or more nucleotide bases results in substitution of one or more amino acids, but do not affect the functional properties of the polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence. "Substantially similar" also refers to nucleic acid fragments wherein changes in one or more nucleotide bases does not affect the ability of the nucleic acid fragment to mediate alteration of gene expression by gene silencing through for example antisense or co-suppression technology. "Substantially similar" also refers to modifications of the nucleic acid fragments of the instant invention such as deletion or insertion of one or more nucleotides that do not substantially affect the functional properties of the resulting transcript vis-a-vis the ability to mediate gene silencing or alteration of the functional properties of the resulting protein molecule.
      <br/>
      It is therefore understood that the invention encompasses more than the specific exemplary nucleotide or amino acid sequences and includes functional equivalents thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      For example, it is well known in the art that antisense suppression and co-suppression of gene expression may be accomplished using nucleic acid fragments representing less than the entire coding region of a gene, and by nucleic acid fragments that do not share 100% sequence identity with the gene to be suppressed.
      <br/>
      Moreover, alterations in a nucleic acid fragment which result in the production of a chemically equivalent amino acid at a given site, but do not effect the functional properties of the encoded polypeptide, are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Thus, a codon for the amino acid alanine, a hydrophobic amino acid, may be substituted by a codon encoding another less hydrophobic residue, such as glycine, or a more hydrophobic residue, such as valine, leucine, or isoleucine.
      <br/>
      Similarly, changes which result in substitution of one negatively charged residue for another, such as aspartic acid for glutamic acid, or one positively charged residue for another, such as lysine for arginine, can also be expected to produce a functionally equivalent product.
      <br/>
      Nucleotide changes which result in alteration of the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the polypeptide molecule would also not be expected to alter the activity of the polypeptide.
      <br/>
      Each of the proposed modifications is well within the routine skill in the art, as is determination of retention of biological activity of the encoded products.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Moreover, substantially similar nucleic acid fragments may also be characterized by their ability to hybridize.
      <br/>
      Estimates of such homology are provided by either DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization under conditions of stringency as is well understood by those skilled in the art (Hames and Higgins, Eds. (1985) Nucleic Acid Hybridisation, IRL Press, Oxford, U.K.).
      <br/>
      Stringency conditions can be adjusted to screen for moderately similar fragments, such as homologous sequences from distantly related organisms, to highly similar fragments, such as genes that duplicate functional enzymes from closely related organisms.
      <br/>
      Post-hybridization washes determine stringency conditions.
      <br/>
      One set of preferred conditions uses a series of washes starting with 6X SSC, 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, then repeated with 2X SSC, 0.5% SDS at 45 (degree)  C. for 30 min, and then repeated twice with 0.2X SSC, 0.5% SDS at 50 (degree)  C. for 30 min.
      <br/>
      A more preferred set of stringent conditions uses higher temperatures in which the washes are identical to those above except for the temperature of the final two 30 min washes in 0.2 *  SSC, 0.5% SDS was increased to 60 (degree)  C. Another preferred set of highly stringent conditions uses two final washes in 0.1X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Substantially similar nucleic acid fragments of the instant invention may also be characterized by the percent identity of the amino acid sequences that they encode to the amino acid sequences disclosed herein, as determined by algorithms commonly employed by those skilled in this art.
      <br/>
      Preferred are those nucleic acid fragments whose nucleotide sequences encode amino acid sequences that are 80% identical to the amino acid sequences reported herein.
      <br/>
      More preferred nucleic acid fragments encode amino acid sequences that are 90% identical to the amino acid sequences reported herein.
      <br/>
      Most preferred are nucleic acid fragments that encode amino acid sequences that are 95% identical to the amino acid sequences reported herein.
      <br/>
      Sequence alignments and percent identity calculations were performed using the Megalign program of the LASARGENE bioinformatics computing suite (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, Wis.).
      <br/>
      Multiple alignment of the sequences was performed using the Clustal method of alignment (Higgins and Sharp (1989) CABIOS. 5:151-153) with the default parameters (GAP PENALTY=10, GAP LENGTH PENALTY=10).
      <br/>
      Default parameters for pairwise alignments using the Clustal method were KTUPLE 1, GAP PENALTY=3, WINDOW=5 and DIAGONALS SAVED=5.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A "substantial portion" of an amino acid or nucleotide sequence comprises an amino acid or a nucleotide sequence that is sufficient to afford putative identification of the protein or gene that the amino acid or nucleotide sequence comprises.
      <br/>
      Amino acid and nucleotide sequences can be evaluated either manually by one skilled in the art, or by using computer-based sequence comparison and identification tools that employ algorithms such as BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool; Altschul et al. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410; see also www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).
      <br/>
      In general, a sequence of ten or more contiguous amino acids or thirty or more contiguous nucleotides is necessary in order to putatively identify a polypeptide or nucleic acid sequence as homologous to a known protein or gene.
      <br/>
      Moreover, with respect to nucleotide sequences, gene-specific oligonucleotide probes comprising 30 or more contiguous nucleotides may be used in sequence-dependent methods of gene identification (e.g., Southern hybridization) and isolation (e.g., in situ hybridization of bacterial colonies or bacteriophage plaques).
      <br/>
      In addition, short oligonucleotides of 12 or more nucleotides may be used as amplification primers in PCR in order to obtain a particular nucleic acid fragment comprising the primers.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a "substantial portion" of a nucleotide sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence that will afford specific identification and/or isolation of a nucleic acid fragment comprising the sequence.
      <br/>
      The instant specification teaches amino acid and nucleotide sequences encoding polypeptides that comprise one or more particular plant proteins.
      <br/>
      The skilled artisan, having the benefit of the sequences as reported herein, may now use all or a substantial portion of the disclosed sequences for purposes known to those skilled in this art.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the instant invention comprises the complete sequences as reported in the accompanying Sequence Listing, as well as substantial portions of those sequences as defined above.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      "Codon degeneracy" refers to divergence in the genetic code permitting variation of the nucleotide sequence without effecting the amino acid sequence of an encoded polypeptide.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the instant invention relates to any nucleic acid fragment comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes all or a substantial portion of the amino acid sequences set forth herein.
      <br/>
      The skilled artisan is well aware of the "codon-bias" exhibited by a specific host cell in usage of nucleotide codons to specify a given amino acid.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when synthesizing a nucleic acid fragment for improved expression in a host cell, it is desirable to design the nucleic acid fragment such that its frequency of codon usage approaches the frequency of preferred codon usage of the host cell.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      "Synthetic nucleic acid fragments" can be assembled from oligonucleotide building blocks that are chemically synthesized using procedures known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      These building blocks are ligated and annealed to form larger nucleic acid fragments which may then be enzymatically assembled to construct the entire desired nucleic acid fragment. "Chemically synthesized", as related to nucleic acid fragment, means that the component nucleotides were assembled in vitro.
      <br/>
      Manual chemical synthesis of nucleic acid fragments may be accomplished using well established procedures, or automated chemical synthesis can be performed using one of a number of commercially available machines.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the nucleic acid fragments can be tailored for optimal gene expression based on optimization of nucleotide sequence to reflect the codon bias of the host cell.
      <br/>
      The skilled artisan appreciates the likelihood of successful gene expression if codon usage is biased towards those codons favored by the host.
      <br/>
      Determination of preferred codons can be based on a survey of genes derived from the host cell where sequence information is available.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      "Gene" refers to a nucleic acid fragment that expresses a specific protein, including regulatory sequences preceding (5' non-coding sequences) and following (3' non-coding sequences) the coding sequence. "Native gene" refers to a gene as found in nature with its own regulatory sequences. "Chimeric gene" refers any gene that is not a native gene, comprising regulatory and coding sequences that are not found together in nature.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a chimeric gene may comprise regulatory sequences and coding sequences that are derived from different sources, or regulatory sequences and coding sequences derived from the same source, but arranged in a manner different than that found in nature. "Endogenous gene" refers to a native gene in its natural location in the genome of an organism.
      <br/>
      A "foreign" gene refers to a gene not normally found in the host organism, but that is introduced into the host organism by gene transfer.
      <br/>
      Foreign genes can comprise native genes inserted into a non-native organism, or chimeric genes.
      <br/>
      A "transgene" is a gene that has been introduced into the genome by a transformation procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      "Coding sequence" refers to a nucleotide sequence that codes for a specific amino acid sequence. "Regulatory sequences" refer to nucleotide sequences located upstream (5' non-coding sequences), within, or downstream (3' non-coding sequences) of a coding sequence, and which influence the transcription, RNA processing or stability, or translation of the associated coding sequence.
      <br/>
      Regulatory sequences may include promoters, translation leader sequences, introns, and polyadenylation recognition sequences.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      "Promoter" refers to a nucleotide sequence capable of controlling the expression of a coding sequence or functional RNA.
      <br/>
      In general, a coding sequence is located 3' to a promoter sequence.
      <br/>
      The promoter sequence consists of proximal and more distal upstream elements, the latter elements often referred to as enhancers.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an "enhancer" is a nucleotide sequence which can stimulate promoter activity and may be an innate element of the promoter or a heterologous element inserted to enhance the level or tissue-specificity of a promoter.
      <br/>
      Promoters may be derived in their entirety from a native gene, or be composed of different elements derived from different promoters found in nature, or even comprise synthetic nucleotide segments.
      <br/>
      It is understood by those skilled in the art that different promoters may direct the expression of a gene in different tissues or cell types, or at different stages of development, or in response to different environmental conditions.
      <br/>
      Promoters which cause a nucleic acid fragment to be expressed in most cell types at most times are commonly referred to as "constitutive promoters".
      <br/>
      New promoters of various types useful in plant cells are constantly being discovered; numerous examples may be found in the compilation by Okamuro and Goldberg (1989) Biochemistry of Plants 15:1-82.
      <br/>
      It is further recognized that since in most cases the exact boundaries of regulatory sequences have not been completely defined, nucleic acid fragments of different lengths may have identical promoter activity.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The "translation leader sequence" refers to a nucleotide sequence located between the promoter sequence of a gene and the coding sequence.
      <br/>
      The translation leader sequence is present in the fully processed mRNA upstream of the translation start sequence.
      <br/>
      The translation leader sequence may affect processing of the primary transcript to mRNA, mRNA stability or translation efficiency.
      <br/>
      Examples of translation leader sequences have been described (Turner and Foster (1995) Molecular Biotechnology 3:225).
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The "3' non-coding sequences" refer to nucleotide sequences located downstream of a coding sequence and include polyadenylation recognition sequences and other sequences encoding regulatory signals capable of affecting mRNA processing or gene expression.
      <br/>
      The polyadenylation signal is usually characterized by affecting the addition of polyadenylic acid tracts to the 3' end of the mRNA precursor.
      <br/>
      The use of different 3' non-coding sequences is exemplified by Ingelbrecht et al. (1989) Plant Cell 1:671-680.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      "RNA transcript" refers to the product resulting from RNA polymerase-catalyzed transcription of a DNA sequence.
      <br/>
      When the RNA transcript is a perfect complementary copy of the DNA sequence, it is referred to as the primary transcript or it may be a RNA sequence derived from posttranscriptional processing of the primary transcript and is referred to as the mature RNA. "Messenger RNA (mRNA)" refers to the RNA that is without introns and that can be translated into polypeptide by the cell. "cDNA" refers to a double-stranded DNA that is complementary to and derived from mRNA. "Sense" RNA refers to an RNA transcript that includes the mRNA and so can be translated into a polypeptide by the cell. "Antisense RNA" refers to an RNA transcript that is complementary to all or part of a target primary transcript or mRNA and that blocks the expression of a target gene (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,107,065, incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      The complementarity of an antisense RNA may be with any part of the specific nucleotide sequence, i.e., at the 5' non-coding sequence, 3' non-coding sequence, introns, or the coding sequence. "Functional RNA" refers to sense RNA, antisense RNA, ribozyme RNA, or other RNA that may not be translated but yet has an effect on cellular processes.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The term "operably linked" refers to the association of two or more nucleic acid fragments on a single nucleic acid fragment so that the function of one is affected by the other.
      <br/>
      For example, a promoter is operably linked with a coding sequence when it is capable of affecting the expression of that coding sequence (i.e., that the coding sequence is under the transcriptional control of the promoter).
      <br/>
      Coding sequences can be operably linked to regulatory sequences in sense or antisense orientation.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The term "expression", as used herein, refers to the transcription and stable accumulation of sense (mRNA) or antisense RNA derived from the nucleic acid fragment of the invention.
      <br/>
      Expression may also refer to translation of mRNA into a polypeptide. "Antisense inhibition" refers to the production of antisense RNA transcripts capable of suppressing the expression of the target protein. "Overexpression" refers to the production of a gene product in transgenic organisms that exceeds levels of production in normal or non-transformed organisms. "Co-suppression" refers to the production of sense RNA transcripts capable of suppressing the expression of identical or substantially similar foreign or endogenous genes (U.S. Pat. No. 5,231,020, incorporated herein by reference).
    </p>
    <p num="33">"Altered levels" refers to the production of gene product(s) in transgenic organisms in amounts or proportions that differ from that of normal or non-transformed organisms.</p>
    <p num="34">
      "Mature" protein refers to a post-translationally processed polypeptide; i.e., one from which any pre- or propeptides present in the primary translation product have been removed. "Precursor" protein refers to the primary product of translation of mRNA; i.e., with pre- and propeptides still present.
      <br/>
      Pre- and propeptides may be but are not limited to intracellular localization signals.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      A "chloroplast transit peptide" is an amino acid sequence which is translated in conjunction with a protein and directs the protein to the chloroplast or other plastid types present in the cell in which the protein is made. "Chloroplast transit sequence" refers to a nucleotide sequence that encodes a chloroplast transit peptide.
      <br/>
      A "signal peptide" is an amino acid sequence which is translated in conjunction with a protein and directs the protein to the secretory system (Chrispeels (1991) Ann. Rev. Plant Phys.
      <br/>
      Plant Mol. Biol. 42:21-53).
      <br/>
      If the protein is to be directed to a vacuole, a vacuolar targeting signal (supra) can further be added, or if to the endoplasmic reticulum, an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (supra) may be added.
      <br/>
      If the protein is to be directed to the nucleus, any signal peptide present should be removed and instead a nuclear localization signal included (Raikhel (1992) Plant Phys. 100:1627-1632).
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      "Transformation" refers to the transfer of a nucleic acid fragment into the genome of a host organism, resulting in genetically stable inheritance.
      <br/>
      Host organisms containing the transformed nucleic acid fragments are referred to as "transgenic" organisms.
      <br/>
      Examples of methods of plant transformation include Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (De Blaere et al. (1987) Meth. Enzymol. 143:277) and particle-accelerated or "gene gun" transformation technology (Klein et al. (1987) Nature (London) 327:70-73; U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,050, incorporated herein by reference).

      Standard recombinant DNA and molecular cloning techniques used herein are well known in the art and are described more fully in Sambrook et al.

    <p num="38">
      Nucleic acid fragments encoding at least a portion of several ornithine-oxo-acid transaminases have been isolated and identified by comparison of random plant cDNA sequences to public databases containing nucleotide and protein sequences using the BLAST algorithms well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      The nucleic acid fragments of the instant invention may be used to isolate cDNAs and genes encoding homologous proteins from the same or other plant species.
      <br/>
      Isolation of homologous genes using sequence-dependent protocols is well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Examples of sequence-dependent protocols include, but are not limited to, methods of nucleic acid hybridization, and methods of DNA and RNA amplification as exemplified by various uses of nucleic acid amplification technologies (e.g., polymerase chain reaction, ligase chain reaction).
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      For example, genes encoding other omithine-oxo-acid transaminases, either as cDNAs or genomic DNAs, could be isolated directly by using all or a portion of the instant nucleic acid fragments as DNA hybridization probes to screen libraries from any desired plant employing methodology well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Specific oligonucleotide probes based upon the instant nucleic acid sequences can be designed and synthesized by methods known in the art (Maniatis).
      <br/>
      Moreover, the entire sequences can be used directly to synthesize DNA probes by methods known to the skilled artisan such as random primer DNA labeling, nick translation, or end-labeling techniques, or RNA probes using available in vitro transcription systems.
      <br/>
      In addition, specific primers can be designed and used to amplify a part or all of the instant sequences.
      <br/>
      The resulting amplification products can be labeled directly during amplification reactions or labeled after amplification reactions, and used as probes to isolate full length cDNA or genomic fragments under conditions of appropriate stringency.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In addition, two short segments of the instant nucleic acid fragments may be used in polymerase chain reaction protocols to amplify longer nucleic acid fragments encoding homologous genes from DNA or RNA.
      <br/>
      The polymerase chain reaction may also be performed on a library of cloned nucleic acid fragments wherein the sequence of one primer is derived from the instant nucleic acid fragments, and the sequence of the other primer takes advantage of the presence of the polyadenylic acid tracts to the 3' end of the mRNA precursor encoding plant genes.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the second primer sequence may be based upon sequences derived from the cloning vector.
      <br/>
      For example, the skilled artisan can follow the RACE protocol (Frohman et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:8998) to generate cDNAs by using PCR to amplify copies of the region between a single point in the transcript and the 3' or 5' end.
      <br/>
      Primers oriented in the 3' and 5' directions can be designed from the instant sequences.
      <br/>
      Using commercially available 3' RACE or 5' RACE systems (BRL), specific 3' or 5' cDNA fragments can be isolated (Ohara et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:5673; Loh et al. (1989) Science 243:217).
      <br/>
      Products generated by the 3' and 5' RACE procedures can be combined to generate full-length cDNAs (Frohman and Martin (1989) Techniques 1:165).

    <p num="41">
      Availability of the instant nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences facilitates immunological screening of cDNA expression libraries.
      <br/>
      Synthetic peptides representing portions of the instant amino acid sequences may be synthesized.
      <br/>
      These peptides can be used to immunize animals to produce polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies with specificity for peptides or proteins comprising the amino acid sequences.
      <br/>
      These antibodies can be then be used to screen cDNA expression libraries to isolate full-length cDNA clones of interest (Lerner (1984) Adv. Immunol. 36:1; Maniatis).
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The nucleic acid fragments of the instant invention may be used to create transgenic plants in which the disclosed polypeptide are present at higher or lower levels than normal or in cell types or developmental stages in which they are not normally found.
      <br/>
      This would have the effect of altering the level of arginine in those cells.
      <br/>
      Extra arginine resulting from an increase in ornithine biosynthesis may have nutraceutical utility.
      <br/>
      Manipulation of the levels of ornithine-oxo-acid transaminase may result in plants which are more resistant to salt stress.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Overexpression of the proteins of the instant invention may be accomplished by first constructing a chimeric gene in which the coding region is operably linked to a promoter capable of directing expression of a gene in the desired tissues at the desired stage of development.
      <br/>
      For reasons of convenience, the chimeric gene may comprise promoter sequences and translation leader sequences derived from the same genes. 3' Non-coding sequences encoding transcription termination signals may also be provided.
      <br/>
      The instant chimeric gene may also comprise one or more introns in order to facilitate gene expression.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Plasmid vectors comprising the instant chimeric gene can then constructed.
      <br/>
      The choice of plasmid vector is dependent upon the method that will be used to transform host plants.
      <br/>
      The skilled artisan is well aware of the genetic elements that must be present on the plasmid vector in order to successfully transform, select and propagate host cells containing the chimeric gene.
      <br/>
      The skilled artisan will also recognize that different independent transformation events will result in different levels and patterns of expression (Jones et al. (1985) EMBO J. 4:2411-2418; De Almeida et al. (1989) Mol. Gen. Genetics 218:78-86), and thus that multiple events must be screened in order to obtain lines displaying the desired expression level and pattern.
      <br/>
      Such screening may be accomplished by Southern analysis of DNA, Northern analysis of mRNA expression, Western analysis of protein expression, or phenotypic analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      For some applications it may be useful to direct the instant polypeptide to different cellular compartments, or to facilitate its secretion from the cell.
      <br/>
      It is thus envisioned that the chimeric gene described above may be further supplemented by altering the coding sequence to encode the instant polypeptide with appropriate intracellular targeting sequences such as transit sequences (Keegstra (1989) Cell 56:247-253), signal sequences or sequences encoding endoplasmic reticulum localization (Chrispeels (1991) Ann. Rev. Plant Phys.
      <br/>
      Plant Mol. Biol. 42:21-53), or nuclear localization signals (Raikhel (1992) Plant Phys. 100:1627-1632) added and/or with targeting sequences that are already present removed.
      <br/>
      While the references cited give examples of each of these, the list is not exhaustive and more targeting signals of utility may be discovered in the future.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      It may also be desirable to reduce or eliminate expression of genes encoding the instant polypeptide in plants for some applications.
      <br/>
      In order to accomplish this, a chimeric gene designed for co-suppression of the instant polypeptide can be constructed by linking a gene or gene fragment encoding that polypeptide to plant promoter sequences.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a chimeric gene designed to express antisense RNA for all or part of the instant nucleic acid fragment can be constructed by linking the gene or gene fragment in reverse orientation to plant promoter sequences.
      <br/>
      Either the co-suppression or antisense chimeric genes could be introduced into plants via transformation wherein expression of the corresponding endogenous genes are reduced or eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Molecular genetic solutions to the generation of plants with altered gene expression have a decided advantage over more traditional plant breeding approaches.
      <br/>
      Changes in plant phenotypes can be produced by specifically inhibiting expression of one or more genes by antisense inhibition or cosuppression (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,190,931, 5,107,065 and 5,283,323).
      <br/>
      An antisense or cosuppression construct would act as a dominant negative regulator of gene activity.
      <br/>
      While conventional mutations can yield negative regulation of gene activity these effects are most likely recessive.
      <br/>
      The dominant negative regulation available with a transgenic approach may be advantageous from a breeding perspective.
      <br/>
      In addition, the ability to restrict the expression of specific phenotype to the reproductive tissues of the plant by the use of tissue specific promoters may confer agronomic advantages relative to conventional mutations which may have an effect in all tissues in which a mutant gene is ordinarily expressed.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The person skilled in the art will know that special considerations are associated with the use of antisense or cosuppression technologies in order to reduce expression of particular genes.
      <br/>
      For example, the proper level of expression of sense or antisense genes may require the use of different chimeric genes utilizing different regulatory elements known to the skilled artisan.
      <br/>
      Once transgenic plants are obtained by one of the methods described above, it will be necessary to screen individual transgenics for those that most effectively display the desired phenotype.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the skilled artisan will develop methods for screening large numbers of transformants.
      <br/>
      The nature of these screens will generally be chosen on practical grounds, and is not an inherent part of the invention.
      <br/>
      For example, one can screen by looking for changes in gene expression by using antibodies specific for the protein encoded by the gene being suppressed, or one could establish assays that specifically measure enzyme activity.
      <br/>
      A preferred method will be one which allows large numbers of samples to be processed rapidly, since it will be expected that a large number of transformants will be negative for the desired phenotype.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The instant polypeptide (or portions thereof) may be produced in heterologous host cells, particularly in the cells of microbial hosts, and can be used to prepare antibodies to the these proteins by methods well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      The antibodies are useful for detecting the polypeptide of the instant invention in situ in cells or in vitro in cell extracts.
      <br/>
      Preferred heterologous host cells for production of the instant polypeptide are microbial hosts.
      <br/>
      Microbial expression systems and expression vectors containing regulatory sequences that direct high level expression of foreign proteins are well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Any of these could be used to construct a chimeric gene for production of the instant polypeptide.
      <br/>
      This chimeric gene could then be introduced into appropriate microorganisms via transformation to provide high level expression of the encoded ornithine-oxo-acid transaminase.
      <br/>
      An example of a vector for high level expression of the instant polypeptide in a bacterial host is provided (Example 6).
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      All or a substantial portion of the nucleic acid fragments of the instant invention may also be used as probes for genetically and physically mapping the genes that they are a part of, and as markers for traits linked to those genes.
      <br/>
      Such information may be useful in plant breeding in order to develop lines with desired phenotypes.
      <br/>
      For example, the instant nucleic acid fragments may be used as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers.
      <br/>
      Southern blots (Maniatis) of restriction-digested plant genomic DNA may be probed with the nucleic acid fragments of the instant invention.
      <br/>
      The resulting banding patterns may then be subjected to genetic analyses using computer programs such as MapMaker (Lander et al. (1987) Genomics 1:174-181) in order to construct a genetic map.
      <br/>
      In addition, the nucleic acid fragments of the instant invention may be used to probe Southern blots containing restriction endonuclease-treated genomic DNAs of a set of individuals representing parent and progeny of a defined genetic cross.
      <br/>
      Segregation of the DNA polymorphisms is noted and used to calculate the position of the instant nucleic acid sequence in the genetic map previously obtained using this population (Botstein et al. (1980) Am. J Hum. Genet. 32:314-331).

      <br/>
      For example, F2 intercross populations, backcross populations, randomly mated populations, near isogenic lines, and other sets of individuals may be used for mapping.

      In another embodiment, nucleic acid probes derived from the instant nucleic acid sequences may be used in direct fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping (Trask (1991) Trends Genet. 7:149-154).

      Although current methods of FISH mapping favor use of large clones (several to several hundred KB; see Laan et al. (1995) Genome Research 5:13-20), improvements in sensitivity may allow performance of FISH mapping using shorter probes.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      A variety of nucleic acid amplification-based methods of genetic and physical mapping may be carried out using the instant nucleic acid sequences.
      <br/>
      Examples include allele-specific amplification (Kazazian (1989) J. Lab. Clin. Med. 114(2):95-96), polymorphism of PCR-amplified fragments (CAPS; Sheffield et al. (1993) Genomics 16:325-332), allele-specific ligation (Landegren et al.

(1997) Nature Genetics 7:22-28) and Happy Mapping (Dear and Cook (1989) Nucleic Acid Res. 17:6795-6807).
      <br/>
      For these methods, the sequence of a nucleic acid fragment is used to design and produce primer pairs for use in the amplification reaction or in primer extension reactions.
      <br/>
      The design of such primers is well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      In methods employing PCR-based genetic mapping, it may be necessary to identify DNA sequence differences between the parents of the mapping cross in the region corresponding to the instant nucleic acid sequence.

      This, however, is generally not necessary for mapping methods.

      cDNA libraries may be prepared by any one of many methods available.
      <br/>
      For example, the cDNAs may be introduced into plasmid vectors by first preparing the cDNA libraries in Uni-ZAP (tm)  XR vectors according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, Calif.).
      <br/>
      The Uni-ZAP (tm)  XR libraries are converted into plasmid libraries according to the protocol provided by Stratagene.
      <br/>
      Upon conversion, cDNA inserts will be contained in the plasmid vector pBluescript.
      <br/>
      In addition, the cDNAs may be introduced directly into precut Bluescript II SK(+) vectors (Stratagene) using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), followed by transfection into DH10B cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (GIBCO BRL Products).
      <br/>
      Once the cDNA inserts are in plasmid vectors, plasmid DNAs are prepared from randomly picked bacterial colonies containing recombinant pBluescript plasmids, or the insert cDNA sequences are amplified via polymerase chain reaction using primers specific for vector sequences flanking the inserted cDNA sequences.
      <br/>
      Amplified insert DNAs or plasmid DNAs are sequenced in dye-primer sequencing reactions to generate partial cDNA sequences (expressed sequence tags or "ESTs"; see Adams et al., (1991) Science 252:1651).
      <br/>
      The resulting ESTs are analyzed using a Perkin Elmer Model 377 fluorescent sequencer.

      <br/>
      The cDNA sequences obtained in Example 1 were analyzed for similarity to all publicly available DNA sequences contained in the "nr" database using the BLASTN algorithm provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

      For convenience, the P-value (probability) of observing a match of a cDNA sequence to a sequence contained in the searched databases merely by chance as calculated by BLAST are reported herein as "pLog" values, which represent the negative of the logarithm of the reported P-value.
