    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a thermoplastic resin composition comprising a propylene-ethylene block copolymer resin, a low crystalline ethylene-octene copolymer, a low crystalline ethylene-butene copolymer, a specific elastomer having a block structure, talc, and a specific additive admixture, which is excellent in terms of processability on injection molding and in the appearance of a molded product, has good flexural modulus, impact resistance, elongation in tension, surface hardness, and heat resistance, and is also excellent in adhesion to a paint film and improved in terms of prevention of mold contamination, and thus is particularly suited for the production of injection-molded products such as automotive interior trims.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      So far, numerous attempts have been made to increase the impact resistance and rigidity of polypropylene resins by the addition thereto of ethylene-propylene copolymers, various ethylene copolymers, and talc.
      <br/>
      For instance, resin compositions having excellent impact resistance are known from JP-B-63-42929, JP-A-64-150, JP-A-64-66263, and JP-A-1-204946.
    </p>
    <p num="5">However, the composition set forth in the above JP-B-63-42929 is insufficient in flexural modulus and heat resistance due to the use of a polypropylene of not so high crystallinity.</p>
    <p num="6">The compositions described in JP-A-64-150, JP-A-64-66263 and JP-A-1-204946, because of their low talc content, are suited for some applications, e.g., bumpers but their flexural modulus is too low for interior trims.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Furthermore, JP-A-4-159345 discloses an ethylene- ALPHA -olefin copolymer composition containing a large amount of inorganic filler.
      <br/>
      This composition has a high specific gravity, and thus is not preferred in the light of weight reduction of automobiles.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In order to reduce the above drawbacks, JP-A-7-53843 has proposed a composition.
      <br/>
      This composition, however, is unsatisfactory in fluidity for use in applications requiring a higher level of fluidity where molding should be carried out at a low pressure in short cycle times.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Regarding the interior trims, they are in most cases coated with a paint to enhance the commercial value.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, however, polypropylene materials for interior trims generally exhibit poor adhesion to a paint film, especially when fats and oils are involved.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the development of materials having higher adhesion to a paint film has been desired in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      On the other hand, there is the following problem with the conventional talc-containing polypropylene composite materials at the time of their molding.
      <br/>
      Thus, during the long-term continuous molding of the composite materials, bleedouts are gradually deposited on molds, whereby the resulting molded product undesirably exhibits a high gloss.
      <br/>
      This is particularly pointed out for automotive interior trims.
      <br/>
      A propylene polymer which provides a solution to this problem while maintaining the physical properties has been proposed in JP-A-5-209094 and JP-A-6-17982.
      <br/>
      However, this polymer utilizes no weathering agent.
      <br/>
      In view of the fact that stabilizers used for improving weathering resistance usually exert an adverse influence on the contamination of molds, there is still left much to be desired.
    </p>
    <p num="11">An object of the present invention is to provide a thermoplastic resin composition which has high fluidity, good physical properties and excellent moldability, can provide moldings having good adhesion to a paint film, is improved in terms of prevention of mold contamination, and is especially suited for the production of automotive interior trims such as an instrument panel.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">It has now been found that the above object can be achieved by incorporating an elastomer component having specific crystallinity, an elastomer component having substantially no crystallinity, an elastomer having a block structure as a compatibilizing agent component, talc, and optionally specific additives in specific proportions into a propylene-ethylene block copolymer which contains a propylene homopolymer moiety of high fluidity and high crystallinity.</p>
    <p num="13">Thus, the present invention provides a thermoplastic resin composition comprising the following components (A) to (E):</p>
    <p num="14">component (A): 50 to 74.7% by weight of a propylene-ethylene block copolymer resin containing a propylene homopolymer moiety having a melt flow rate (MFR) of 20 to 200 g/10 min. and an isotactic pentad fraction of at least 0.98, said block copolymer having an MFR of 10 to 100 g/10 min. and a ratio of the weight average molecular weight (Mw) to the number average molecular weight (Mn), Mw/Mn, of 5 to 7,</p>
    <p num="15">component (B): 5 to 10% by weight of an ethylene-octene random copolymer having a melting temperature of 40 to 60 (degree)  C. and an MFR of 0.5 to 15 g/10 min.,</p>
    <p num="16">component (C): 5 to 10% by weight of an ethylene-butene random copolymer not having a melting temperature of 35 (degree)  C. or above and having an MFR of 0.5 to 15 g/10 min.,</p>
    <p num="17">
      component (D): 0.3 to 5% by weight of an elastomer, the elastomer being either one comprising a block structure represented by the following formula �I� and/or the following formula �II� and having a melting temperature of 80 to 110 (degree)  C., an MFR of 0.5 to 20 g/10 min., a polyethylene crystalline moiety content of 20 to 40% by weight, and a random elastomer moiety content of 60 to 80% by weight, or one comprising a block structure represented by the following formula �III�, the following formula �IV� and/or the following formula �V� and having a melt flow rate of not more than 15 g/10 min. and a polystyrene moiety content of 10 to 40% by weight and a random elastomer moiety content of 60 to 90% by weight:
      <br/>
      polyethylene-(ethylene/butene random elastomer)-polyethylene   �I�
      <br/>
      polyethylene-(ethylene/butene random elastomer)   �II�
      <br/>
      polystyrene-(ethylene/butene random elastomer)-polystyrene   �III�
      <br/>
      polystyrene-(ethylene/propylene random elastomer)-polystyrene   �IV�
      <br/>
      polystyrene-(ethylene/propylene random elastomer)   �V�;
    </p>
    <p num="18">and</p>
    <p num="19">component (E): 15 to 25% by weight of a talc having an average particle diameter of up to 5  MU m and a specific surface area of at least 3.5 m2 /g.</p>
    <p num="20">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the thermoplastic resin composition further comprises the following components (F) and (G):</p>
    <p num="21">component (F): 0.05 to 2 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight in total of the components (A) to (E), of a hindered amine having a structure represented by the following formula:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="22">
      component (G): 0.05 to 4 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight in total of the components (A) to (E), of a metal salt represented by the following general formula �VI�:
      <br/>
      (RCOO)2 X   �VI�
    </p>
    <p num="23">wherein R represents a monovalent hydrocarbon group having a molecular weight of 290 to 500 and X is zinc, magnesium, or calcium.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The thermoplastic resin composition comprising the specific components (A) to (E) in specific proportions has good moldability, can provide a molding having good appearance, has good flexural modulus, impact resistance, elongation in tension, heat resistance, and surface hardness, and is improved in adhesion to a paint film.
      <br/>
      When the thermoplastic resin composition further comprises the components (F) and (G), the weathering resistance is improved without suffering from the problem of mold contamination.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention is particularly suited for the production of injection-molded automotive interior components, such as instrument panels.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="25">�I� Thermoplastic Resin Composition</p>
    <p num="26">(1) Components</p>
    <p num="27">(A) Propylene-Ethylene Block Copolymer (Component (A))</p>
    <p num="28">The propylene-ethylene block copolymer (component (A)) to be used in the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention has a melt flow rate (MFR--measured at 230 (degree)  C. under a load of 2.16 kg) of 10 to 100 g/10 min., preferably 20 to 80 g/10 min., and more preferably 30 to 60 g/10 min.</p>
    <p num="29">
      If the MFR of the propylene-ethylene block copolymer is below the lower limit of the above range, there will then be obtained a composition poor in fluidity.
      <br/>
      For molding such a composition into a thin molded article, the use of a molding machine having a large clamping force or an increase in molding temperature is required, adversely affecting the productivity.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the MFR of the propylene-ethylene block copolymer exceeds the upper limit of the above range, there will then be obtained a composition having an insufficient impact resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The above MFR of the propylene-ethylene block copolymer may be adjusted during polymerization, or alternatively may be adjusted after polymerization using organic peroxides such as diacyl peroxides and dialkyl peroxides.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The ratio of the weight average molecular weight (Mw) to the number average molecular weight (Mn), Mw/Mn, representing the molecular weight distribution of the propylene-ethylene block copolymer is 5 to 7, preferably 5.5 to 6.5. When the ratio Mw/Mn is outside the above range, the impact resistance is unsatisfactory.
      <br/>
      The ratio Mw/Mn is determined by GPC (gel permeation chromatography).
    </p>
    <p num="32">The propylene homopolymer moiety of the propylene-ethylene block copolymer has an MFR of 20 to 200 g/10 min., preferably 30 to 150 g/10 min., more preferably 40 to 100 g/10 min., and an isotactic pentad fraction (P) of at least 0.98, preferably at least 0.985.</p>
    <p num="33">
      When the MFR of the propylene homopolymer moiety in the propylene-ethylene block copolymer is below the lower limit of the above range, the resulting composition has unsatisfactory fluidity.
      <br/>
      An MFR exceeding the upper limit of the above range, on the other hand, will result in poor impact resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="34">An isotactic pentad fraction (P) of the propylene homopolymer moiety in the propylene-ethylene block copolymer falling below the lower limit of the above range will provide a composition having insufficient flexural modulus.</p>
    <p num="35">The term "isotactic pentad fraction (P)" used herein refers to the isotactic fraction of a pentad unit in the polypropylene molecular chain, determined by using 13 C-NMR.</p>
    <p num="36">The ethylene content of the propylene-ethylene block copolymer is preferably 2 to 8% by weight, and the ethylene content of the elastomer moiety in the block copolymer is preferably 30 to 50% by weight.</p>
    <p num="37">When the ethylene content is below the lower limit of the above range, the heat resistance is likely to become unsatisfactory, while an ethylene content above the upper limit of the above range tends to result in unsatisfactory flexural modulus and surface hardness.</p>
    <p num="38">The ethylene content can be determined by means of infrared spectrophotometry.</p>
    <p num="39">Preparation of Propylene-Ethylene Block Copolymer</p>
    <p num="40">A catalyst of high stereoregularity is used for the preparation of the propylene-ethylene block copolymer.</p>
    <p num="41">Such a catalyst may typically be prepared by a method wherein a titanium trichloride composition obtained by reducing titanium tetrachloride with an organoaluminum compound, followed by treatment with an electron donor and an electron acceptor, is combined with an organoaluminum compound and an aromatic carboxylate (see JP-A-56-100806, JP-A-56-120712, and JP-A-58-104907), or a method wherein titanium tetrachloride and an electron donor are brought into contact with a magnesium halide to prepare a supported catalyst (see JP-A-57-63310, JP-A-63-43915, and JP-A-63-83116).</p>
    <p num="42">The block copolymerization of propylene and ethylene may be conducted by the vapor-phase fluidized bed, solution, slurry and other methods in the presence of the above catalyst.</p>
    <p num="43">Quantitative Ratio</p>
    <p num="44">It is important that the amount of the above propylene-ethylene block copolymer (component (A)) used lies within the range of, on the basis of the total amount of the above components (A) to (E), 50 to 74.7% by weight, preferably 53 to 72% by weight, more preferably 55 to 70% by weight.</p>
    <p num="45">At an amount below the lower limit of the above range a composition poor in flexural modulus will be obtained, whereas at an amount exceeding the upper limit of the above range a composition of decreased impact resistance will be obtained.</p>
    <p num="46">(B) Ethylene-Octene Random Copolymer (Component (B))</p>
    <p num="47">
      The ethylene-octene random copolymer (component (B) to be used in the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention functions to develop good surface hardness and good adhesion to a paint film while improving the impact resistance.
      <br/>
      The use of the component (B) in combination with the components (C) and (D) described below can provide a material having both well-balanced physical properties and good adhesion to a paint film.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The component (B) is an elastomer having a melting temperature of 40 to 60 (degree)  C., preferably 40 to 55 (degree)  C., as measured with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC).
      <br/>
      When the melting temperature exceeds the upper limit of the above range, the adhesion to a paint film is unsatisfactory.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when it is below the above range, the surface hardness is unsatisfactory.
      <br/>
      In this case, the octene content is not particularly limited so far as the melting temperature falls within the above range.
      <br/>
      The octene content, however, is preferably 15 to 19 mol %, more preferably 16 to 18 mol %, from the viewpoint of the adhesion to a paint film and the surface hardness.
    </p>
    <p num="49">The term "octene content" used herein refers to a value determined by using 13 C-NMR based on Macromolecules (1982) 15, 353-360 and ibid., 1402-1406.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The MFR (230 (degree)  C., load 2.16 kg) of the ethylene-octene random copolymer is generally 0.5 to 15 g/10 min., preferably 0.75 to 9 g/10 min., particularly preferably 1 to 6 g/10 min.
      <br/>
      When the MFR of the elastomer is below the lower limit of the above range, the impact resistance is unsatisfactory, while when it exceeds the upper limit of the above range, the Rockwell hardness is unsatisfactory.
    </p>
    <p num="51">A single type or a mixture of two or more types of ethylene-octane random copolymers may be used as the ethylene-octene random copolymer.</p>
    <p num="52">The density of the component (B) is preferably not more than 0.90 g/cm3, more preferably 0.86 to 0.89 g/cm3, particularly preferably 0.865 to 0.880 g/cm3, from the viewpoint of the impact resistance and the surface hardness.</p>
    <p num="53">The density of the component (B) is measured by punching a specimen having a size of 50 mm * 50 mm * 1 mm in thickness out of a 1 mm-thick sheet prepared by press molding at 160 (degree)  C. and then measuring the density with a density gradient tube without annealing.</p>
    <p num="54">Preparation of Ethylene-Octene Random Copolymer</p>
    <p num="55">
      The ethylene-octene random copolymer as the component (B) may be prepared in the presence of the so-called Ziegler catalyst comprising a combination of a titanium compound, such as titanium halide, with an organoaluminum-magnesium complex, such as an alkylaluminum-magnesium complex or an alkylalkoxyaluminum complex, an alkylaluminum, an alkylaluminum chloride or the like, a metallocene compound described in WO-91/04257 or the like.
      <br/>
      Copolymerization in the presence of the metallocene compound can provide a copolymer having better effect.
    </p>
    <p num="56">The random copolymerization of ethylene and octene may be conducted by the vapor-phase fluidized bed, solution, slurry and other methods.</p>
    <p num="57">Quantitative Ratio</p>
    <p num="58">It is important that the amount of the ethylene-octene random copolymer (component (B)) used lies within the range of, on the basis of the total amount of the above components (A) to (E) in the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention, 5 to 10% by weight, preferably 6 to 9% by weight.</p>
    <p num="59">If the amount of the ethylene-octene random copolymer incorporated is below the lower limit of the above range, the impact resistance and the adhesion to a paint film are unsatisfactory, while if the amount exceeds the upper limit of the above range, the flexural modulus is unsatisfactory.</p>
    <p num="60">(C) Ethylene-Butene Random Copolymer (Component (C))</p>
    <p num="61">The ethylene-butene random copolymer (component (C)) to be used in the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention functions to develop good adhesion to a paint film while improving the impact resistance.</p>
    <p num="62">The use of the component (C) in combination with the above components (B) and the component (D) described below can provide a material having both well-balanced physical properties and good adhesion to a paint film.</p>
    <p num="63">
      The component (C) is a substantially noncrystalline elastomer not having a melting temperature of 35 (degree)  C. or above as measured with DSC.
      <br/>
      If the melting temperature is 35 (degree)  C. or above, the adhesion to a paint film is unsatisfactory.
    </p>

      Starting materials shown in Tables 13 to 19 were blended together at proportions indicated in Tables 20 and 21 with the addition of 0.1 part by weight of tetrakis �methylene-3-(3',5'-di-t-butyl-4'-hydroxyphenyl) propionate�methane (IRGANOX 1010, manufactured by CIBA-GEYGY LTD.) and 0.05 part by weight of tris-(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) phosphite.
      <br/>
      The blend was mixed by use of a super-mixer made by Kawada Seisakusho for 5 minutes, and then kneaded and granulated at a preset temperature of 210 (degree)  C. by means of a biaxial kneader (FCM made by KOBE STEEL LTD.) to obtain a thermoplastic resin composition.
    </p>
    <p num="176">Thereafter, the thermoplastic resin composition was molded into various test pieces at a molding temperature of 210 (degree)  C. using an injection molding machine having a clamping force of 350 tons and 100 tons, and the test pieces were measured for MFR, flexural modulus, Izod impact value, elongation in tension, surface hardness, thermal deformation temperature, adhesion to a paint film (resistance to contamination with fats and oils), prevention of mold contamination, and weathering resistance according to the above measuring methods.</p>
