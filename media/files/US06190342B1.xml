    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      When our distant ancestors, whether homo erectus or homo habilis, came out of the trees and stood upright, some portions of descendant homo sapiens anatomy remained specifically vulnerable to insults associated with an erect posture and its necessary variations.
      <br/>
      A particular portion of anatomy vulnerable to the insults caused by stresses of physical exertion is the lumbar or lower back region.
      <br/>
      Leaning over from the erect position and lifting from the flexed position results in an unbalance in tone of the anterior and posterior muscle groups.
      <br/>
      The measured distance, between a point at the top of the shoulders and a point below the buttocks or gluteus, is three to ten inches longer in the bent over or hip-flexed position than when the person is standing erect, depending on the height, weight and muscular configuration of the particular individual.
    </p>
    <p num="2">The stress of this extension and the resulting strain on the muscles, ligaments and vertebrae of the spine is a cause of much pain and disability to many people in all segments of society, from farmers tilling the soil to secretaries filing documents, to athletes, librarians, and especially to manual laborers.</p>

    <heading>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      The object of this invention is the provision of an apparatus designed to ease the strain on the thoraco-lumbar-pelvic region of the anatomy and to correct the imbalance in muscle tone in this region that occurs because greater muscular exertion is required assuming an erect position from hip-flexed position than from assuming an erect position to hip-flexed position.
      <br/>
      The harness of my invention has two purposes: (1) to strengthen and retone the anterior abdominal, sublumbar, thoracic and pelvic muscle groups, (2) to serve as an aid in lifting heavy objects from any hip-flexed position to the standing position.
      <br/>
      These objectives are accomplished simultaneously with my invention.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">The Taylor Harness is an elastic harness having a shoulder harness, a tension equalizing plate, elastic back bands, leg straps and thigh bands, all interconnected in order to strengthen and support the abdominal and anterior sublumbar, thoracic and pelvic muscle groups.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The purposes of the Taylor Harness are: (1) to strengthen the abdominal and anterior sublumbar thoracic and pelvic muscle groups and (2) to serve as an aid in lifting heavy material objects from any hip-flexed position to the standing position.
      <br/>
      Both purposes may be accomplished simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The Taylor Harness consists of six continuous but separating component parts.
      <br/>
      These are (1) padded shoulder harness with Velcro.RTM. snap latch buckles, (2) a fulcrum type tension equalizing plate, (3) elastic rubber back bands with covers, (4) leg straps having knee and ankle supports with Velcro.RTM. or snap latch buckles, (5) thigh leg bands with supports and belt, and (6) a crotchless long legged brief shorts with Velcro.RTM. or snap latch fasteners.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The functional application of the component parts of the Taylor Harness are used to accomplish the above stated purposes as follows: (1) The leg straps cross the shoe soles of the user in front of the heel of the shoe.
      <br/>
      They then extend upward on the medial and lateral aspects of each ankle, and up each leg to the gluteal area.
      <br/>
      At a point adjacent to each ankle these straps are stabilized with adjustable ankle straps with pads.
      <br/>
      At a point just above the ankle these leg straps have snaps and/or vertical slits in each through which passes another padded strap.
      <br/>
      This second padded strap circles the ankle and is fastened on the upper part of the front of the foot at shoe lace level with Velcro.RTM. or snap fasteners.
      <br/>
      This padded strap, as it circles the foot above the ankle prevents the vertical straps from developing slack as they pass under the shoe sole in front of the heel of the shoe.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The leg straps extend upward on the medial and lateral aspect of each leg.
      <br/>
      At a point just below and just above the knee of each leg they, have slits or snaps in each through which pass padded straps.
      <br/>
      These padded straps encircle the leg above and below the knee and are fastened with Velcro.RTM. or snaps on the anterolateral aspect of each leg.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      From the knee the vertical leg straps extend upward to a point just below the gluteal bulge.
      <br/>
      At this point each of the two vertical straps on each leg is attached to the ventral portion of the elastic back bands with adjustable snap locks, Velcro.RTM., or other fasteners.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      An alternate ventral anchoring system to the leg strap system is the upper thigh system.
      <br/>
      These upper thigh bands consist of two bands four to eight inches wide that encircle each thigh two to three inches ventral to the crotch.
      <br/>
      These thigh bands are fastened on the anterolateral aspect of each thigh with Velcro.RTM. fasteners.
      <br/>
      These bands are each supported by two narrow belts, which extend upward from the anteromedial and posterolateral aspect of each upper thigh band to their attachments to a narrow Velcro.RTM. fastened waist belt.
      <br/>
      This waist belt and four descending belts prevent the upper thigh bands from slipping down the thighs.
      <br/>
      These upper thigh bands are used as posterior anchors for the elastic rubber back bands when it would not be practical to use the leg strap anchor system.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A second alternate ventral anchoring system to the leg strap system is the crotchless long-legged brief shorts sytem, henceforth ("CLLB").
      <br/>
      Shorts are made of leather, nylon or any of a number of other materials.
      <br/>
      The shorts cover the waist down to the lower thigh area.
      <br/>
      They separate into a front and rear half along a separating and attachment line from top to bottom on both sides from the lateral waist, lateral hip and lateral thigh.
      <br/>
      They are fastened at these same separating lines with Velcro.RTM. or snap latch fasteners.
      <br/>
      These shorts are crotchless from the upper pubic area ventrally, posteriorly and then dorsally to a point above the split of the buttocks.
      <br/>
      These shorts serve as a ventral attaching point via Velcro.RTM. or snap latch fasteners of the CLLB for some users with certain dress limitations and or comfort variations.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The elastic or rubber back bands are dual and run parallel as they travel upward from their attachments to the vertical leg straps, crotchless long-legged brief shorts, or upper thigh bands ventral to the gluteal bulge.
      <br/>
      These elastic back bands are covered with soft leather, fabric or nylon slide boots that protect the user from friction between skin or clothing and the elastic back bands.
      <br/>
      The slide boots cover the entire length of the elastic back bands and are attached to the shoulder harness via elastic cuffs at the tension equalizing plate in the upper-posterior thoracic area just below the shoulder blades.
      <br/>
      The slide boots are attached ventrally, with elastic cuffs, to the vertical leg straps in the gluteal area.
      <br/>
      The slide boots have a strap attached to each of their medial slides in the area of the fourth or fifth lumbar vertebrae.
      <br/>
      These belly straps transverse laterally from their medial attachments to the slide boots, encircle the lower abdomen and are attached to each other with Velcro.RTM. or snaps in the anterior abdomen.
      <br/>
      These straps serve to either separate or pull together the elastic rubber back bands as they pass over the gluteal, lumbar and thoracic areas.
      <br/>
      When attached, the belly straps pull the elastic rubber back bands together for lifting and/or for exercising.
      <br/>
      With the belly straps unfastened, the elastic rubber back bands and their slide boots may be slipped off the gluteus and on to the lateral sides of the hips.
      <br/>
      In this lateral hip position the user can sit, bend, and put all parts of the Taylor Harness into position for use or make adjustments, without there being pressure on the elastic rubber back bands.
      <br/>
      The elastic rubber back bands are attached, ventral to the shoulder blades, in the upper posterior thoracic area to the tension equalizing plate.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The tension equalizing plate functions to equalize the tension on the elastic rubber back bands as the user walks, bends, or lifts.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The tension equalizing plate is an inverted triangular shape snapped apparatus with three points of attachment.
      <br/>
      The tension equalizing plate is attached to the shoulder harness at one of its points and to the top of each elastic rubber back band at its other two points.
      <br/>
      The tension equalizing plate (TEP) has a heavy friction pad underneath it on which it pivots.
      <br/>
      This pad is to prevent friction between the skin or clothing of the user as the TEP pivots as a fulcrum to equalize the tension of the elastic rubber back bands as the user walks.
      <br/>
      The TEP has slotted adjustment points at the attachment point of the elastic rubber back bands.
      <br/>
      These slotted adjustment points on the TEP allow for compensation in elastic rubber back band tension to be made for users of differing heights and strides as they walk.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The padded shoulder harness forms a "V" configuration on the back of the user in the area of the shoulder blades.
      <br/>
      It is at the ventral portion of this "V" configuration that the elastic rubber back bands are attached to the shoulder harness via the tension equalizing plate with Velcro.RTM. and adjustable snap buckles.
      <br/>
      The two top straps of the "V" pass over the shoulders between the neck and the scapulo-humeral joints upwardly and forwardly.
      <br/>
      They then pass ventrally and posteriorly under the arms over the lateral aspect of the rib cage, to the center of the back where they cross in the vicinity of the last thoracic vertebra.
      <br/>
      They pass under the elastic rubber back bands at their point of crossing and continue anteriorally around the rib cage and are attached in front near the ventral sternal area with Velcro.RTM. and or snap buckles.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The Taylor Harness accomplishes its stated purposes because it takes advantage of the fact that the anatomical measured distance between a point at the top of the shoulders and a point below the buttocks or gluteus is three to ten inches shorter in the standing position than it is when bent over or in the hip-flexed position, depending on the height and weight of the individual.
      <br/>
      The application of elastic bands, via a stable shoulder harness to a stable point at the bottom of the foot or upper thigh, makes it possible to store energy expended in bending the body at the sacrofemoral and vertebral joints.
      <br/>
      This energy thus stored in the elastic rubber bands is in turn utilized to assist the posterior thoracic, lumbar and pelvic muscles in the lifting process.
    </p>
    <p num="18">In essence what the Taylor Harness does is shift part of the workload of the lifting process from those posterior muscle groups of the shoulders, rib cage, spinal column, pelvis, and upper thighs, as we bend from the "pelvic extended" position and lift from the "pelvic flexed" position, to those anterior muscle groups of the thoracic cage, shoulders, the abdomen, the spinal column, pelvic and thigh.</p>
    <p num="19">
      By wearing the Taylor Harness "part time" the maintenance of a balance of muscle tone in all muscle groups mentioned is attained and maintained.
      <br/>
      A balance in muscle tone in the spinal musculature, especially in the lumbar area is essential if spinal nerve irration is to be alleviated or prevented.
      <br/>
      With the poor physical condition of most people today, the use of the Taylor Harness part time, would retone anterior muscle groups, that are seldom used, and as a result would aid in treating and greatly reduce the incidence of lumbrosacral disc syndrome.

      These conditions are a result of an imbalance in muscle tone of the anterior and posterior muscle groups.
      <br/>
      This imbalance of muscle tone causes the rupture of the posterior side of the annulas fibrosa, a narrowing of the intervertebral space, thus the pinching of colateral nerves and spinal cord pressure.

      The industrial applications, for workers bending and lifting, would be greatly reduced if workers were fitted with and wore the Taylor Harness part time on the job.
      <br/>
      The Taylor Harness would be invaluable in the treatment of those individuals already experiencing an episode of lumbar disc rupture.
