    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates generally to transition metal oxide-containing materials and, more particularly, to vanadium oxide-containing compositions and the rational synthesis thereof.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Transition metal oxide surfaces are known to serve as catalytic surfaces for a large number of important industrial chemical transformations.
      <br/>
      The mechanism of their interaction with substrate molecules, however, is generally not well understood due mainly to the complex nature of these poorly characterized surfaces that are generally inaccessible to various physical chemical analytical techniques.
      <br/>
      As a result, the suitability of particular catalytic surfaces for specific processes is currently commonly determined empirically with practically little or no possibility of systematic improvements in the performance of such catalytic materials.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      As will be appreciated, numerous environmental and technological challenges exist for the application of such catalytic materials.
      <br/>
      Such challenges range from and include the removal of toxic materials from automotive vehicle exhaust and industrial flue streams, selective or controlled oxidation of hydrocarbons, photochemical conversion of water into H2 and O2, synthesis of gasoline from synthesis gas (also referred to as "syn-gas"), cost-effective nitrogen fixation, preparation of food stuffs and drugs, and removal of urea from blood, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Polyoxometalates or transition metal oxide clusters (such as of vanadium, molybdenum and tungsten, for example) and their derivatives provide remarkably diverse and well-defined building blocks generally believed well suited for use in generating or assembling nanosized molecular systems.
      <br/>
      Recently, conventional organic and inorganic ligands (e.g., PO43-, AsO43-, SO42-, etc.) have been used to join together or "glue" metal oxide moieties to prepare supramolecular structures and solids.
      <br/>
      Such ligands, however, generally have only limited thermal stability and may be scarce.
    </p>
    <p num="5">In view of the above, there is a need and a demand for a rational synthesis of well characterizable metal oxide surfaces with desired features--with and without immobilized catalytic active groups (such as metal ions, cluster compounds, organometallic fragments, asymmetric ligands, enzymes or cells, for example) such as may be helpful or useful in the satisfaction of one or more environmental or technological requirements such as described above.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">A general object of the invention is to provide for the rational synthesis of transition metal oxide-containing materials and the materials resulting therefrom.</p>
    <p num="7">A more specific objective of the invention is to overcome one or more of the problems described above.</p>

    <p num="24">General Synthesis Method</p>
    <p num="25">
      In accordance with the invention, a method for the general synthesis of mixed-metal oxide-based compositions of the invention involves first the addition of water or an aqueous solution (such as a 3 mL solution of a 5 mmol aqueous solution) of CatOH (Cat=Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, NH4+, N2 H5+, H3 O+, R4 N+ and quaternary amines) to a stirring slurry of V2 O5 in hot water, e.g., 2.5 mmol of V2 O5 in 10 mL of 40-93 (degree)  C. water.
      <br/>
      After treating the resulting solution with a reducing agent (e.g., hydrazinium sulfate, hydrazinium chloride, or hydrazinium hydroxide), the reaction mixture is then further heated, e.g., heated for an additional 10 minutes, to obtain a dark solution.
      <br/>
      The dark solution is then diluted with an additional quantity of water (e.g., to 25 ml) and subsequently treated with an appropriate salt of at least one species of metallic element M (such as described above) with L (e.g., 1.25 mmol, where L=H2 O, O, NO, N2, acetyl acetone, pyridine, 2,2'-bipyridine, (H2 N(CH2)d NH2) (d=2 or 3 ), RNH2 and R2 NH, for example) and further heated (e.g., for 1 to 12 hours).
      <br/>
      The resultant solution can then be stored at room temperature and the precipitated product filtered from the mother liquor, washed if necessary to remove any impurity, and dried, such as in air at room temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Thus, in accordance with one synthesis method in accordance with the invention, a linked array of V18 O42 X metal and oxygen clusters is formed by adding an aqueous solution of CatOH to a heated aqueous slurry of V2 O5 to form a first resulting solution, where Cat is at least one cationic species selected from the group consisting of Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, NH4+, N2 H5+, H3 O+, R4 N+ and quaternary amines.

      The first resulting solution is subsequently treated with a reducing agent to form a reaction mixture which, in turn, is treated a salt of the particularly desired metallic element.

      The synthesis method of the invention is now further described with reference to the synthesis of the above-identified prototype composition, �H6 Mn3 V18 O42 (VO4)(H2 O)12 � * 30H2 O which was prepared in the following manner:
      <br/>
      An aqueous solution (3 mL) of LiOH * H2 O (5 mmol) was added to a slurry of V2 O5 (2.5 mmol) in water (10 mL) maintained at 95 (degree)  C. After treating the resulting solution with solid hydrazinium sulfate (2.5 mmol), the reaction mixture was heated for another 5-10 minutes.
      <br/>
      The dark solution was diluted to 25 ml and subsequently treated with KMnO4 (1.25 mmol) and heated for 1.5 hours.
      <br/>
      The resultant solution was filtered and allowed to stay at room temperature for 12 hours.
      <br/>
      Dark black prism shaped crystals were filtered from the mother liquor, washed with water, and dried in air at room temperature to give 0.25 g (60% yield based on vanadium) of �H6 Mn3 V18 O42 (VO4)(H2 O)12 � * 30H2 O.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As will be appreciated, such a synthesis method generally provides a simple procedure for linking or otherwise assembling building blocks, such as composed of polyoxometalates and/or metal oxide fragments, to form framework materials or solids without incorporating conventional ligands, that may be scarce and generally have limited stability.
      <br/>
      Given that well-characterized metal oxide clusters and compounds can be employed in the practice of the invention, rationally designed transition metal oxide-based solid surfaces and materials with desired properties, such as relating to catalysis, redox, sorbtion, ion exchange, etc., can be synthesized in accordance with the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The x-ray structural analysis of a single crystal of the above preparation of �H6 Mn3 V18 O42 (VO4)(H2 O)12 � * 30H2 O revealed a highly symmetrical three-dimensional framework structure (see FIG. 2) composed of the transition metal oxide building-block units, shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The extended structure consists of "spheres" of +V19 O46 } cores each linked, in three dimensional array, by six  MU 2 -+Mn(H2 O)4 } bridges to six other neighboring +V19 O46 } units.
      <br/>
      This generates a network of �-+V19 O46 }- MU 2 -Mn(H2 O)4 -+V19 O46 }-� (infinity)  arrays running along three mutually perpendicular directions.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the structure of �H6 Mn3 V18 O42 (VO4)(H2 O)12 � * 30H2 O can be described as infinite arrays of +V19 O46 } clusters each cluster connected with six other +V19 O46 } clusters through six  MU 2 +Mn(H2 O)4 } bridges.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Each +V19 O46 } unit, such as shown in FIG. 1, can be viewed as constructed from a +V18 O42 } shell or cluster encapsulating a tetrahedral +VO4 }3- group which interacts with the 12 V-centers of the shell, each oxygen (O1) of the +VO4 }3- unit (V1-O=1.661  Angstrom ) interacting in  MU 4 -mode with three V(2)- centers, forming V(1)-O(1)-V(2)shell bonds (O1-Vshell =2.440  Angstrom ) and forcing a local idealized tetrahedral symmetry upon the +V19 O46 } unit.
      <br/>
      The 12 +VO6 } units of the +V19 O46 } core are fuse with 6 +VO5 } groups through common edges and linked with the central +VO4 } unit via corner sharing.
      <br/>
      The octahedral geometry around each vanadium (V2) in the 12+VO6 } units is defined by a terminal oxo-group (O4) (V2-O4=1.609  Angstrom ), four  MU 3 -oxygens (O2, O3) ofthe shell (V2-O=1.949-1.981  Angstrom ) and one  MU 4 -oxygen (O1) (O1-V2 =2.440  Angstrom ) from the central +VO4 } unit.
      <br/>
      The geometry around each one of the square-pyramidal vanadium (V3) in the six +VO5 }, is defined by four basal  MU 3 -oxo groups (O2, O3) (V3-O=1.889-2.019  Angstrom ) from the shell and an apical  MU 2 -oxygen (O5) (V3-O5=1.640  Angstrom ) which in turn is linearly bonded to the manganese(II) center of one of the six +Mn(H2 O)4 } bridges, forming +V(3)-O(5)-Mn(H2 O)4 -O(5)-} bonds, that link the +V19 O46 } clusters with each other.
      <br/>
      The octahedral geometry around each manganese(II) is completed by four oxygen atoms (O6) from the aqua ligands (Mn-O(H2) =2.220  Angstrom ), each one disordered over three positions, and two trans-  MU 2 -oxo groups (O5) (Mn-O=2.136  Angstrom ).
    </p>
    <p num="31">Bond valence sum (BVS) calculations and metal-oxygen bond lengths identify twelve O3 groups having attached hydrogen, which refines with occupancy of 0.5, and O6 to be H2 O. This conclusion and the result of manganometric titration of VIV sites (15 VIV per formula unit) are consistent with the charge balance consideration and mixed-valence nature of �H6 Mn3 V18 O42 (VO4)(H2 O)12 � * 30H2 O.</p>
    <p num="32">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the packing of �H6 Mn3 V18 O42 (VO4)(H2 O)12 � * 30H2 O generates tunnels and cavities, defined by +V19 O46 } and +Mn(H2 O)4 } units, occupied by lattice water molecules.
      <br/>
      Thermogravimetric analysis of �H6 Mn3 V18 O42 (VO4)(H2 O)12 � * 30H2 O showed an initial weight loss of about 20.5%, corresponding to the total removal of the lattice water, at 70 (degree)  C. followed by weight loss due to the removal of coordinated water at 257 (degree)  C. Further heating up to 500 (degree)  C. resulted in the formation of a stable reduced mixed-metal oxide phase without further weight loss.
      <br/>
      A sample of �H6 Mn3 V18 O42 (VO4)(H2 O)12 � * 30H2 O heated at 70 (degree)  C. for four hours exhibited reversible water absorption as evidenced by infrared spectral studies.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The chemistry associated with +V19 O46 } and +V18 O42 } cores is further exploitable for synthesizing new surfaces, for example, functional derivatives of materials of (1), such as for �H6 Mn3 V18 O42 (VO4)(H2 O)12 � * 30H2 O the replacement of H2 O from +Mn(H2 O)4 } by other organic and inorganic groups may offer possibility of anchoring groups (e.g., metal ions, clusters, asymmetric units) deemed suitable for enhancing the reactivity of the surface.
      <br/>
      Also, the bridging Mn(II) centers may be substituted by other metal ions and organometallic groups.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Correspondingly, mixed-metal oxide-based solids in accordance with the invention can generally be described as composed of a linked array of a plurality of vanadium oxide building blocks wherein a vanadium and oxygen shell cluster encapsulates a central X unit, where X is at least one species such as VO4, SO4, Cl, Br, I, H2 O, HCOO and NO2, for example.</p>
    <p num="35">
      In accordance with one particular embodiment of the invention, such vanadium oxide building blocks are desirably linked to several other of the vanadium oxide building blocks by bridges such as may include an L species selected from the group consisting of H2 O, O, NO, N2, acetyl acetone, pyridine, 2,2'-bipyridine, (H2 N(CH2)d NH2) (d=2 or 3 ), RNH2 and R2 NH.
      <br/>
      Further, in particular mixed-metal oxide-based solids in accordance with the invention, at least one of such linking bridges comprises MLz, where M is a metallic element species and where if, L=monodentate then z=4 and where if, L=bidentate then z=2 or 4.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In the above-described embodiment, vanadium oxide building blocks are linked to six other such vanadium oxide building blocks in a three-dimensional array.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the vanadium oxide building block can be described as a V18 O42 vanadium and oxygen shell cluster which encapsulates a central VO4 unit with such a V18 O42 (VO4) vanadium and oxygen shell cluster linked in three dimensional array by six  MU 2 -+Mn(H2 O)4 } bridges to six neighboring V18 O42 (VO4) vanadium and oxygen shell clusters.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In accordance with one preferred embodiment of the invention, the method of forming the linked array of V18 O42 X metal and oxygen shell clusters includes the step of adding an aqueous solution of CatOH to a heated aqueous slurry of V2 O5 to form a first resulting solution, where Cat is at least one cationic species selected from the group consisting of Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, NH4+, N2 H5+, H3 O+, R4 N+ and quaternary amines.
      <br/>
      The first resulting solution is subsequently treated with a reducing agent to form a reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture is subsequently with a salt of a metallic element.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      As will be appreciated, the compositions of the invention can desirably find use in various applications including, for example, as catalysts in various processes such as the cracking, isomerization, polymerization and selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, in the production of synthetic gasoline, as shape-selective catalysts, and in the catalytic reduction of NOx and/or SOx gases from various process streams such as the flue gas streams of power plants, chemical and petrochemical industries and the exhaust of automobiles, for example.
      <br/>
      For example, there is a need for inexpensive materials to replace precious metal catalysts (e.g., platinum, rhodium, and palladium, for example) such as currently commonly employed in automobiles, power plants and nuclear facilities for the cleanup of exhaust gases, such as the removal of one or more of NOx, CO, NH3, SO2 and volatile organic chemicals (VOC's) therefrom.
