    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to an oil-based ink for preparing a printing plate by an ink jet process, and a method for preparing a printing plate by an ink jet process using it.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to an oil-based ink excellent in redispersibility, stability, image reproducibility and printability (press life), and a method for preparing a printing plate by an ink jet process using it.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">With recent developments in business machines and progress in office automation, in the field of light printing, offset lithographic systems have been widely applied in which printing process is conducted, namely images are formed, on direct imaging lithographic printing plate precursors comprising water-resistant supports having provided thereon image receiving layers having hydrophilic surfaces.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Conventional printing plate precursors for direct imaging lithographic printing comprise supports formed of paper or plastic films which are subjected to water-resistant treatments having provided thereon image accepting layers (or image receiving layers) containing inorganic pigments, water-soluble resins and water resistance imparting agents.
      <br/>
      Methods are known in which lipophilic images are formed on such direct imaging lithographic printing plate precursor with typewriters or by hand writing using lipophilic ink, or by transferring images from ink ribbons by heat melting with heat transfer printers, thereby preparing printing plates.
    </p>
    <p num="4">However, the printing plates prepared by such methods are not sufficient in mechanical strength of image areas, so that missing easily takes place in the image areas in printing.</p>
    <p num="5">On the other hand, ink jet recording is a recording method low in noise and printable at high speed, and has recently been rapidly popularized.</p>
    <p num="6">As such ink jet recording systems, there are proposed various ink jet processes such as a so-called electric field controlling system in which ink is discharged using electrostatic attraction, a so-called drop-on-demand system (pressure pulse system) in which ink is discharged using the oscillation pressure of a piezoelectric element, and a so-called bubble (thermal) system in which ink is discharged using pressure developed by forming bubbles and allowing them to grow by heating at high temperature, and very detailed images can be obtained by these systems.</p>
    <p num="7">In these ink jet recording systems, aqueous ink using water as a main solvent, and oil-based ink using an organic solvent as a main solvent are generally used.</p>
    <p num="8">
      It is also carried out that the above-mentioned lithographic printing plate precursors are made with typewriters using ink jet recording systems, and in this case, aqueous ink in which water is used as a dispersing medium is also employed.
      <br/>
      However, the aqueous ink has the problem that blurs appear in images on precursor materials, or that the picture drawing speed is decreased because of slow drying.
      <br/>
      In order to reduce such a problem, a method using oil-based ink in which a nonaqueous solvent is used as a dispersing medium is disclosed in JP-A-54-117203 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application").
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      However, this method is also insufficient, because blurs are observed in actual printing process images, furthermore, blurs are developed in printing, and the number of printing sheets is limited to several hundred at the most.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, such ink has the problem of being liable to clog a nozzle for discharging minute ink droplets which make it possible to obtain printing process images having high resolution.
    </p>
    <p num="10">In the ink jet recording systems, ink is generally discharged from nozzles through filters, so that abnormal discharge of ink is liable to take place by clogging of the nozzles or the filters, changes in fluidity of ink with time, or other various factors.</p>
    <p num="11">
      This abnormal discharge of ink takes place with respect to not only aqueous ink compositions, but also oil-based ink compositions.
      <br/>
      Various proposals for improving such abnormal discharge of ink have been submitted.
      <br/>
      For example, in order to prevent the abnormal discharge of ink at the time when oil-based ink compositions are used, it is proposed that the viscosity and the specific resistance of the ink compositions are controlled as described in JP-A-49-50935, for the ink jet recording system of the electric field controlling system.
      <br/>
      It is further proposed that the dielectric constant and the specific resistance of solvents used in the ink compositions are controlled as described in JP-A-53-29808.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Furthermore, as attempts to prevent clogging of nozzles caused by general oil-based ink for ink jet printers, there are proposed, for example, methods in which the dispersion stability of pigment particles is improved (e.g., JP-A-4-25573, JP-A-5-25413 and JP-A-5-65443) and methods in which specific compounds are contained as ink compositions (e.g., JP-A-3-79677, JP-A-3-64377, JP-A-4-202386 and JP-A-7-109431).</p>
    <p num="13">However, when they are used in image formation of lithographic printing plates, all of them are poor in image strength in printing, and printing plates which can satisfy the press life have not been obtained.</p>

    <p num="14">An object of the present invention is to provide an oil-based ink for a printing plate by an ink jet process excellent in redispersibility, storage stability and press life.</p>
    <p num="15">Another object of the present invention is to provide an oil-based ink for a printing plate by an ink jet process which makes it possible to print many sheets of printed material having clear images.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="53">
      The present invention is characterized in that the above-mentioned oil-based ink is discharged on a printing precursor for lithographic printing by an ink jet process to form an image.
      <br/>
      The oil-based ink used is excellent in dispersion stability, redispersibility and storage stability, and it is possible to print clear images on a number of sheets by use of the resulting lithographic printing plate.
    </p>
    <p num="54">The oil-based ink for use in the present invention is described below.</p>
    <p num="55">
      The nonaqueous carrier liquids having an electric resistance of 109  OMEGA cm or more and a dielectric constant of 3.5 or less used in the present invention preferably include straight chain or branched aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and halogen-substituted products of these hydrocarbons.
      <br/>
      Specific examples thereof include octane, isooctane, decane, isodecane, decalin, nonane, dodecane, isododecane, cyclohexane, cyclooctane, cyclodecane, benzene, toluene, xylene, mesitylene Isoper-E, Isoper-G, Isoper-H, Isoper-L (Isoper: trade name of Exxon Co.), Shellsol 70, Shellsol 71 (Shellsol: trade name of Shell Oil Co.), Amsco OME and Amsco 460 (Amsco: trade name of Spirits Co.), and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      The upper limit value of the electric resistance of such nonaqueous carrier liquids is about 1016  OMEGA cm, and the lower limit value of the dielectric constant is about 1.80.
    </p>
    <p num="56">The nonaqueous dispersed resin particles (hereinafter also referred to as "latex particles"), which are the most important constituent in the present invention, are granulated in the presence of a resin (P) for dispersion stabilization which is soluble in an nonaqueous solvent by (i) polymerizing at least one monofunctional monomer (A) with at least one monomer (B) (referred to as "first embodiment of the present invention") or (ii) polymerizing at least one monofunctional monomer (A) with at least one macromonomer (MA) (referred to as "second embodiment of the present invention").</p>
    <p num="57">Here, as the nonaqueous solvents, ones miscible with the nonaqueous carrier liquids of the above-mentioned oil-based ink are basically usable.</p>
    <p num="58">
      That is, as the solvents used in producing the dispersed resin particles, any solvents may be used as long as they are miscible with the above-mentioned carrier liquids.
      <br/>
      Preferred examples thereof include straight chain or branched aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and halogen-substituted products of these hydrocarbons.
      <br/>
      For example, hexane, octane, isooctane, decane, isodecane, decalin, nonane, dodecane, isododecane, Isoper-E, Isoper-G, Isoper-H, Isoper-L, Shellsol -70, Shellsol 71, Amsco OME and Amsco 460 solvents can be used alone or as a mixture of them.
    </p>
    <p num="59">Solvents which can be used by mixing together with these organic solvents include alcohols (for example, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, butyl alcohol and fluorinated alcohols), ketones (for example, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and cyclohexanone), carboxylic acid esters (for example, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, methyl propionate and ethyl propionate), ethers (for example, diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane), and hydrocarbon halides (for example, methylene dichloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane and methylchloroform).</p>
    <p num="60">
      These nonaqueous solvents used by mixing are desirably removed by distillation under heating or reduced pressure after polymerization granulation.
      <br/>
      However, even if they are taken in oil-based ink as latex particle dispersions, no problem is encountered as long as the requirements that the resistance of the ink is 109  OMEGA cm or more and that the dielectric constant is 3.5 or less satisfied.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Usually, it is preferred that solvents similar to the carrier liquids are used in the stage of the production of resin dispersions.
      <br/>
      As described above, such solvents include straight chain or branched aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon halides.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The monofunctional monomers (A) for use in the present invention may be any, as long as they are monofunctional monomers soluble in nonaqueous solvents, but insolubilized by polymerization.
      <br/>

      However, the dispersed resin particles of the present invention obtained by polymerization granulation, allowing the monomer (B) copolymerizable with the monomer (A) to concurrently exist in a small amount (0.1% to 15% by weight) based on the monomer (A), together with the monomer (A) insolubilized by polymerization, did not cause solubilization of the resin and a decrease in softening point of the resin to a degree becoming unpractical as described above, formed monodisperse particles having a desired mean particle size, and were significantly improved in redispersibility.
    </p>
    <p num="173">The dispersed resin particles of the present invention obtained by polymerization granulation, allowing the macromonomer (MA) composed of a copolymerization component soluble in a nonaqueous solvent to exist together with the monomer (A) insolubilized by polymerization, are considered to be caused by the presence of a soluble component contained in the macromonomer (MA) in the particle interface of the insolubilized and dispersed resin, which brings about some kind of improvement on the particle surface to improve the affinity for a dispersing medium and increase the salvation with the dispersing medium, resulting in prevention of coagulation of the resin particles.</p>
    <p num="174">From these, it is considered that coagulation and precipitation of the insoluble particles are inhibited, thereby significantly improving the redispersibility.</p>
    <p num="175">As described above, the use of the resins for dispersion stabilization (P) of the present invention improves the dispersion stability, and the resins are condensed in the oil-based ink when the ink is repeatedly used for a long period of time, thereby improving the fear of raising various problems.</p>
    <p num="176">It is preferred that the oil-based ink used in the present invention contains coloring materials as coloring components for detecting printing plates after processing, together with the above-mentioned dispersed resin particles.</p>
    <p num="177">As the coloring materials, any can be used as -long as they are pigments and dyes previously used in oil-based ink compositions or liquid developers for electrostatic photography.</p>
    <p num="178">
      As the pigments, ones generally used in the technical field of printing can be used, regardless of inorganic pigments or organic pigments.
      <br/>
      Specifically, known pigments can be used without particular limitation, such as carbon black, cadmium red, molybdenum red, Chrome Yellow, cadmium yellow, Titan Yellow, chromiumoxide, pyridian, Titan Cobalt Green, ultramarine blue, Prussian blue, cobalt blue, azo pigments, phthalocyanine pigments, quinacridone pigments, isoindolinone pigments, dioxazine pigments, threne pigments, perylene pigments, perynone pigments, thioindigo pigments, quinophthalone pigments and metal complex pigments.
    </p>
    <p num="179">Preferred examples of the dyes include oil-soluble dyes such as azo dyes, metal complex dyes, naphthol dyes, anthraquinone dyes, indigo dyes, carbonium dyes, quinoneimine dyes, xanthene dyes, cyanine dyes, quinoline dyes, nitro dyes, nitroso dyes, benzoquinone dyes, naphthoquinone dyes, phthalocyanine dyes and metallophthalocyanine dyes.</p>
    <p num="180">
      These pigments and dyes may be used alone or can be used appropriately in combination.
      <br/>
      They are preferably contained within the range of 0.01% to 5% by weight based on the whole ink.
    </p>
    <p num="181">
      These coloring materials may be dispersed by themselves in the nonaqueous solvents as dispersed particles, separately from the dispersed resin particles, or allowed to be contained in the dispersed resin particles.
      <br/>
      When they are allowed to be contained in the dispersed resin particles, the pigments are generally coated with resin materials of the dispersed resin particles to form resin-coated particles, and for the dyes, surface portions of the dispersed resin particles are generally colored therewith to form colored particles.
    </p>
    <p num="182">
      As one of the methods, there is a method described in JP-A-57-48738 in which a dispersed resin is dyed with a preferable dye.
      <br/>
      As another method, there is a method described in JP-A-53-54029 in which a dispersed resin is allowed to chemically combine with a dye, or a method described in JP-B-44-22955 (the term "JP-B" as used herein means an "examined Japanese patent publication") in which a monomer previously containing a dye is used in the production by polymerization granulation to form a dye-containing copolymer.
    </p>
    <p num="183">The dispersed resin particles and the colored particles (or coloring material particles) contained in the oil-based ink of the present invention are electrically detectable particles positively or negatively charged.</p>
    <p num="184">
      It is attainable to impart the electric detecting property to these particles by appropriately utilizing the technology of developers for wet electrostatic photography.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it is carried out by using electric detecting materials described in "Recent Developments and Utilization of Electrophotographic Development Systems and Toner Materials", pages 139 to 148, "Fundamental and Application of Electro-photographic Techniques", edited by Denshi Shashin Gakkai, pages 497 to 505 (Corona, 1988), and Yuji Harazaki, "Electro-photography", 16 (No. 2), 44 (1977), and other additives.
    </p>
    <p num="185">Specifically, it is described, for example, in British Patents 893,429 and 934,038, U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,122,397, 3,900,412 and 4,606,989, JP-B-4-51023, JP-B-6-19595, JP-B-6-19596, JP-B-6-23865, JP-A-60-185963 and JP-A-2-13965.</p>
    <p num="186">
      Charge regulating agents are preferably added in an amount of 0.001 part to 1.0 part by weight based on 1000 parts by weight of dispersing medium or carrier liquid.
      <br/>
      Various additives may be further added if desired, and the upper limit of the total amount of these additives is restricted by the electric resistance of the oil-based ink.
      <br/>
      That is, if the electric resistance of the ink with the dispersed particles removed is lower than 109  OMEGA cm, it becomes difficult to obtain continuous tone images of good quality.
      <br/>
      It is therefore necessary to control the amount of each additive added within this limit.

    <p num="187">The water-resistant supports having lithographically printable hydrophilic surfaces used in the present invention may be any as long as they provide hydrophilic surfaces suitable for lithography, and supports used for conventional offset printing can be used as such.</p>
    <p num="188">Preferably, the surfaces of the image receiving layers receiving ink images are hydrophilic surfaces having a contact angle with water of 5 degrees or less, more preferably 0 degree, which give printed material generating no ink stains in non-image areas as offset printing plates.</p>
    <p num="189">In the present invention, the smoothness of the surface of the image receiving layer is preferably 50 (second/10 ml) or more, and more preferably 80 (second/10 ml) or more, by the Beck smoothness.</p>
    <p num="190">
      Here, the Beck smoothness can be measured with a Beck smoothness tester.
      <br/>
      The Beck smoothness tester is a tester for measuring a time required for a definite amount (10 ml) of air to pass through between a test piece and a glass surface under reduced pressure, wherein the test piece is pressed to a highly smoothly finished circular glass plate having a hole at its center at a definite pressure (1 kg/cm2).
    </p>
    <p num="191">Defects and blurs of ink images formed by the magnitude of unevenness of the image receiving layers are preferably inhibited at a Beck smoothness of 50 or more.</p>
    <p num="192">Preferred embodiments thereof include water-resistant supports comprising water-resistant substrates having provided thereon image receiving layers having lithographically printable hydrophilic surfaces (hereinafter also referred to as a precursor for lithographic printing).</p>
    <p num="193">Examples of the water-resistant supports include a plastic sheet, paper for which printability is provided, an aluminum sheet, a zinc sheet, a bimetal sheet (e.g., a copper-aluminum sheet, a copper-stainless steel sheet and a chromium-copper sheet), a trimetal sheet (e.g, a chromium-copper-aluminum sheet, a chromium-lead-iron sheet, a chromium-copper-stainless steel sheet), preferably having a thickness of 0.1 to 3 mm, most preferably 0.1 to 1 mm.</p>
    <p num="194">Furthermore, they include paper having a thickness of 80  MU m to 200  MU m subjected to water-resistant treatment, paper laminated with plastic films or metal foil, or a plastic film.</p>
    <p num="195">
      Preferably, the water-resistant support has electroconductivity, and a specific electric resistance of 1010  OMEGA cm or less at least at an area directly under the image receiving layer.
      <br/>
      The specific electric resistance is preferably 108  OMEGA cm or less.
    </p>
    <p num="196">In order to provide the specific electric resistance of at least an area directly under the image receiving layer on a substrate such as paper and a film, for example, a layer comprising an electroconductive filler such as carbon black and a binding agent is coated, a metal foil is stuck, and a metal is evaporated.</p>
    <p num="197">On the other hand, examples of the support having an electroconductivity as a whole include electroconductive paper to which sodium chloride is impregnated, a plastic film with which an electroconductive filler is mixed, and a metal plate such as aluminum.</p>
    <p num="198">In the above electroconductivity range, when ink droplets which have been charged in ink jet recording by electric field control are adhered to the image-receiving layer, the charge of the ink droplets is disappeared quickly through earth, and a clear image having no disorder is formed.</p>
    <p num="199">The specific electric resistance (volume specific electric resistance, electric resistivity) was measured by a three-terminal method using a guard electrode according to JIS K-6911.</p>
    <p num="200">The support having an electroconductivity as a whole is explained below.</p>
    <p num="201">For example, the support is obtained by providing both sides of an electroconductive precursor paper obtained by impregnating sodium chloride into a substrate with a water-resistant electroconductive layer.</p>
    <p num="202">In the present invention, the precursor paper used for the substrate include wood pulp paper, synthetic pulp paper and mixed paper of wood pulp paper and synthetic pulp paper as they are.</p>
    <p num="203">The electroconductive layer is explained below.</p>
    <p num="204">
      The electroconductive layer is formed by coating a layer containing an electroconductive filler and a binding agent to both of the above electroconductive paper.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the electroconductive layer is 5  MU m to 20  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="205">The electroconductive filler includes particulated carbon black, graphite, metal powder (e.g., silver powder, copper powder, nickel powder), stannic oxide powder, flake aluminum or nickel, fiber carbon, brass, aluminum, copper and stainless steel.</p>
    <p num="206">The resin used for the binding agent can be selected from various resins appropriately, and specifically, includes hydrophobic resins (e.g., acrylic resin, vinyl chloride resin, styrene resin, styrene-butadiene resin, styrene-acrylate resin, urethane resin, vinylidene chloride resin, vinyl acetate resin) and hydrophilic resins (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol resin, cellulose derivative resin, starch and derivatives thereof, polyacrylamide resin, styrenemaleic anhydride copolymer).</p>
    <p num="207">
      The electroconductive layer may be formed by laminating an electroconductive thin film.
      <br/>
      Examples of the electroconductive thin film include a metal foil and an electroconductive plastic film.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the metal foil laminated material includes an aluminum foil and the electroconductive plastic film laminated material includes a polyethylene resin with which carbon black is mixed.
      <br/>
      The aluminum foil may be hard or soft, and the thickness thereof is preferably 5  MU m to 20  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="208">
      The polyethylene resin laminated film with which carbon black is mixed is preferably obtained by an extrusion laminating method.
      <br/>
      The method comprises melting polyolefin by heating to form a film, immediately pressing the film on precursor paper, and cooling it for laminating.
      <br/>
      Various apparatus for the method are known.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the laminated layer is preferably 10  MU m to 30  MU m. As the support having an electroconductivity as a whole, a plastic film having an electroconductivity as a substrate and a metal sheet can be used as they are so long as the water-resistivity is satisfied.
    </p>
    <p num="209">
      The plastic film having an electroconductivity includes polypropylene or polyester film with which an electroconductive filer such as carbon fiber or carbon black is mixed.
      <br/>
      The metal sheet includes aluminum.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the substrate is preferably 80  MU m to 200  MU m. If it is less than 80  MU m, strength as a printing plate is insufficient.
      <br/>
      If it exceeds 200  MU m, handling properties such as a transportability in a drawing apparatus are decreased.
    </p>
    <p num="210">The composition for providing a layer having an electroconductivity is explained below.</p>
    <p num="211">
      Forming of an electroconductive layer on a water-resistant substrate is carried out in the same manner as in the above-described formation of the support having an electroconductivity as a whole.
      <br/>
      That is, one surface of the substrate is coated with a layer containing an electroconductive filer and a binding agent having a thickness of 5  MU m to 20  MU m, or laminated with a metal foil or a plastic film having an electroconductivity.
    </p>
    <p num="212">Furthermore, in addition to the above methods, for example, a metal vaporization film such as aluminum, tin, palladium or gold may be coated on a plastic film.</p>
    <p num="213">According to the above methods, a support having a specific electric resistance of 1010  OMEGA cm or less as a whole of the support.</p>
    <p num="214">As to the support used in the present invention, the smoothness of a surface on the side adjacent to the image receiving layer is preferably adjusted to 300 (second/10 ml) or more, more preferably 900 (second/10 ml) to 3000 (second/10 ml), and most preferably 1000 (second/10 ml) to 3000 (second/10 ml), by the Beck smoothness.</p>
    <p num="215">
      The image reproducibility and the press life can be further improved by restricting the smoothness of the surface on the side adjacent to the image receiving layer of the support to 300 (second/10 ml) or more by the Beck smoothness.
      <br/>
      Such an improving effect is obtained even if the smoothness of the surface of the image receiving layer is the same, and it is considered that an increase in the smoothness of the surface of the support has improved the adhesive quality between the image area and the image receiving layer.
    </p>
    <p num="216">
      The highly smooth surface of the water-resistant support thus restricted means a surface directly coated with the image receiving layer.
      <br/>
      For example, when an under layer or an overcoat layer described later is provided on the support, it means a surface of the under layer or the overcoat layer.
    </p>
    <p num="217">The image receiving layer whose surface state is adjusted as described above without the influence of unevenness of the surface of the support is sufficiently maintained thereby, which makes it possible to further improve the image quality.</p>
    <p num="218">
      As methods for establishing the smoothness within the above-mentioned range, various known methods can be used.
      <br/>
      Specifically, such methods include a method of melt-adhering a resin to a surface of a substrate, and a method of adjusting the Beck smoothness of a surface of a support by calendering with a highly smooth hot roller.
    </p>
    <p num="219">
      As the above-mentioned method of melt-adhering the resin, coating by extrusion lamination is preferred in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The support adjusted to a desired smoothness can be produced by coating by this extrusion lamination.
      <br/>
      The extrusion lamination is a method in which a resin is melted into a film, which is immediately pressed to base paper, followed by cooling, thus laminating the base paper with the film, and various apparatuses are known.
    </p>
    <p num="220">The thickness of the resin layer thus laminated is 10  MU m or more in terms of production stability, and preferably 10  MU m to 30  MU m.</p>
    <p num="221">
      Furthermore, in the present invention, the under layer can be provided between the support and the image receiving layer for improving the water resistance and the interlayer adhesive quality as described above, and a backcoat layer (back surface layer) can be provided on a surface of the support opposite to the image receiving layer for preventing curls.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the backcoat layer has a smoothness ranging from 150 (second/10 ml) to 700 (second/10 ml).
    </p>
    <p num="222">When a printing plate is supplied to an offset printer, this allows the printing plate to be accurately set on the printer without the occurrence of deviation or slippage.</p>
    <p num="223">When the under layer and the backcoat layer of the support are each adjusted to such a smoothness, it is preferred that the smoothness is controlled by repeating a calender treatment step plural times, for example, by once conducting calender treatment after formation of the image receiving layer and conducting it again after formation of the backcoat layer, or by a combination of the adjustment with respect to compositions of the under layer and the backcoat layer described later, for example, the ratio and the grain size of a pigment, and the adjustment of calender treatment conditions.</p>
    <p num="224">
      The backcoat layer is formed by coating and drying or laminating a coating liquid containing a resin, a pigment or the like on a support.
      <br/>
      The resin can be selected from various resins appropriately.
      <br/>
      Specifically, they include those described for the above-described electroconductive layer (under layer).
    </p>
    <p num="225">
      Furthermore, the pigments include clay, kaolin, talc, diatom earth, calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, titanium oxide and micas.
      <br/>
      In order to attain the desired smoothness, these pigments are preferably used by appropriately selecting their grain size.
      <br/>
      For example, a relatively high smoothness is required in the under layers, so that pigments from which small-sized and large-sized grains are cut off, specifically, having a grain size of about 0.5  MU m to about 10  MU m are preferably used.
      <br/>
      The pigments as described above are preferably used at a ratio of 80 parts to 200 parts by weight in the backcoat layers based on 100 parts by weight of resin.
      <br/>
      In order to obtain excellent water resistance, the under layers and the backcoat layers effectively contain water resistance imparting agents such as melamine resins and polyamide epichlorohydrin resins.
      <br/>
      The above-mentioned grain size can be measured using a scanning electron microscopic (SEM) photograph.
      <br/>
      When the grain is not spherical, the size is a diameter determined by converting a projected area to a circle.
    </p>
    <p num="226">
      When the lithographic printing plate precursor of the present invention is prepared, generally, a solution containing components for the under layer is applied onto one side of the support, followed by drying to form the under layer, if necessary, a solution containing components for the backcoat layer is further applied onto the other side of the support, followed by drying to form the backcoat layer, if necessary, and subsequently, a coating solution containing components for the image receiving layer is applied, followed by drying to form the image receiving layer.
      <br/>
      The amounts of the image receiving layer, the under layer and the backcoat layer coated are each 1 g/m2 to 30 g/m2, and particularly suitably 6 g/m2 to 20 g/m2.
    </p>
    <p num="227">More preferably, the thickness of the water-resistant support provided with the under layer and the backcoat layer ranges from 90  MU m to 130  MU m, and preferably from 100  MU m to 120  MU m.</p>
    <p num="228">The image receiving layer having is provided on the water-resistant support, and the thickness thereof is preferably 5  MU m to 50  MU m.</p>
    <p num="229">
      For example, the image receiving layer comprises a water-soluble binder, an inorganic pigment and a water-resistance imparting agent as its main component.
      <br/>
      The binder includes water-soluble resins, such as PVA, modified PVA (e.g., carboxyl PVA), starch and derivatives thereof, CMC, hydroxyethyl cellulose, casein, gelatin, polyacrylate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, poly(vinyl methyl ether), a copolymer of vinyl acetate and crotonic acid, a copolymer of maleic anhydrate, and a copolymer of styrene and maleic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="230">
      The water resistance imparting agent includes glyoxal, a primary condensation product of a melamine formaldehyde resin, an urea formaldehyde resin or the like, a modified polyamide resin such as a methylated proamide resin, and a polyamide-polyamine-epichlorohydrin resin.
      <br/>
      Examples of the inorganic pigments include clay, kaolin, calcium carbonate, silica, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, barium sulfate, alumina and talc.
      <br/>
      Among these, silica is preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="231">In addition, the image receiving layer may contain a crosslinking catalyst such as ammonium chloride or a silane coupling agent.</p>

      A method for forming an image on the above-mentioned precursor for lithographic printing (hereinafter also referred to as a "master") is described below.

      As a device system for performing such a method, there is, for example, one shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="233">The device system shown in FIG. 1 comprises an ink jet recording device 1 using an oil-based ink.</p>
    <p num="234">
      As shown in FIG. 1, pattern information of images (graphics or sentences) to be formed on a master 2 is first supplied from an information supply source such as a computer 3 to the ink jet recording device 1 using oil-based ink through a transmittal means such as a path 4.
      <br/>
      A head for ink jet recording 10 of the recording device 1 stores oil-based ink therein, and sprays fine droplets of the ink on the master 2 according to the above-mentioned information, when the master 2 passes through in the recording device 1.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the ink adheres to the master 2 according to the above-mentioned pattern.
    </p>

      The application of voltage forms a circuit between the discharge electrode 10b and the counter electrode 10c, and the oil-based ink 11 is discharged from the discharge slit 10a of the head 10, thereby forming images on the master 2 placed on the counter electrode 10c.
