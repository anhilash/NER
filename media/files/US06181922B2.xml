      A step attenuator 6 is connected between a transmission circuit 4 and a transmission power amplifier 8.
      <br/>
      For example, when extremely large output power is transmitted from the radio equipment, the large output power may saturate a reception amplifier in radio equipment at a transmission destination, and may interfere with other radio equipment.
      <br/>
      In such a case, an attenuation value of the step attenuator 6 is selected to be large to reduce the output power of the radio equipment.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Since the step attenuator is widely used for portable apparatuses, miniaturization of the step attenuator is required.
      <br/>
      Further, for applying the step attenuator to the radio equipment, the step attenuator needs to have wide-band frequency performance.

      FIG. 2 shows a typical configuration of the step attenuator.
      <br/>
      A step attenuator 20 is constructed with a plurality of (3 in this case) attenuator units 22a, 22b, 22c connected in series.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The attenuator units 22a, 22b, 22c respectively include two single-pole double-through (SPDT) switches 24a-1 and 24a-2, 24b-1 and 24b-2, 24c-1 and 24c-2, and fixed attenuators 26a, 26b, 26c.
      <br/>
      In the SPDT switches, by selecting whether passing a supplied signal through the fixed attenuator or passing the supplied signal through the other path, an attenuation value of the attenuator 22a, 22b, 22c unit can be digitally controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In a typical step attenuator, when attenuation values of the fixed attenuators are properly selected, by properly switching the SPDT switches of the attenuator units, a desired attenuation value can be digitally selected.
      <br/>
      In the step attenuator 20 shown in FIG. 2, the fixed attenuator 26a of the attenuator unit 22a has an attenuation value 1 dB, the fixed attenuator 26b of the attenuator unit 22b has an attenuation value 2 dB, and the fixed attenuator 26c of the attenuator unit 22c has an attenuation value 4 dB.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a total attenuation value of the step attenuator 20 can be varied from 0 to 7 dB by a 1-dB step by switching the SPDT switches of the attenuator units.

    <p num="10">In each attenuator unit, for the fixed attenuator, a T-type attenuator and a  PI -type attenuator are commonly used.</p>

      <br/>
      When the FET 32 is non-conductive and the FET 34 is conductive, the attenuator unit 30 operates as the T-type attenuator and generates a large attenuation value.

      When the FET 42 is non-conductive and the FETs 44, 46 are conductive, the attenuator unit 40 operates as the  PI -type attenuator and generates a large attenuation value.

      <br/>
      In this way, since the shunt side of the T-type attenuator is constructed with a single FET and is in different from the  PI -type attenuator, the degree to which dispersion of frequency performance of resistance in a conductive condition of the FET has an influence on the attenuator unit 30 may be smaller than that in which the dispersion has an influence on the attenuator unit 40.

      However, when designing the attenuator unit 30 having the T-type attenuator to generate a large attenuation value, the resistance value in the shunt side needs to be extremely small.

      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the inverted control signals can be generated by inverting the control signals in inverter circuits 28a, 28b, 28c.

      Since the inverter circuit 50 includes two FETs, electrical performance of the inverter circuit 50 is easily varied by dispersion in a process.

      <br/>
      Furthermore, since the two FETs in the shunt side of the prior-art attenuator unit are replaced to a single FET in common, degradation of the frequency performance due to dispersion of the FET characteristics may be prevented.

    <p num="29">
      According to the above-mentioned step attenuator, since each attenuator unit has a simple configuration, over all size of the step attenuator may be miniaturized and simplified.

    <p num="48">
      A description will be given of a first embodiment of an step attenuator according to the present invention, by referring to FIG. 6 and FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows a schematic diagram of an attenuator unit of the step attenuator according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      An attenuator unit 100 has a resistor 106, and resistors 108, 110 arranged on both sides of the resistor 106.
      <br/>
      These three resistors constitute a  PI -type attenuator having a fixed attenuation value.
      <br/>
      The attenuator unit may be used as an attenuator by itself, and a plurality of the attenuator units may be used as the step attenuator.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      In the attenuator unit 100, a field-effect transistor (FET) 102 is connected to the resistor 106 in parallel.
      <br/>
      An FET 104 is connected between a joint node of the resistor 108 and the resistor 110 and a ground 112.
      <br/>
      A gate voltage of the FET 102 is controlled by an external control signal S through a resistor 114.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a gate of the FET 104 is controlled by an inverted external control signal which is produced by inverting the external control signal S in an inverter circuit 122, through a resistor 116.
      <br/>
      A description of the inverter circuit 122 will be given in detail later.
    </p>
    <p num="50">Next, an operation of the attenuator unit 100 will be discussed.</p>
    <p num="51">
      When the FET 102 is turned off and the FET 104 is turned on by the external control signal S, the attenuator unit 100 is operative as the  PI -type attenuator.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a signal provided to a terminal 118 is attenuated according to an attenuation value determined by the resistors 106, 108 and 110, and an attenuated signal is produced at a terminal 120.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      On the other hand, when the FET 102 is turned on and the FET 104 is turned off by the external control signal S, a path between the terminal 118 and the terminal 120 becomes conductive.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the signal provided at a terminal 118 is produced to the terminal 120 without being attenuated.
    </p>
    <p num="53">In this way, by digitally controlling the FET 102 and the FET 104, a total attenuation value throughout the path between the terminal 118 and the terminal 120 may be set by a given step.</p>
    <p num="54">
      In particular, in the attenuator unit 100 according to the present invention, the number of transistors in the shunt side is reduced by one as compared to the prior-art attenuator unit shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the number of components and layout area for the attenuator unit may be reduced, and, thus, a simply-configurated attenuator unit may be realized.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since the two FETs in the shunt side of the prior-art attenuator unit 40 are replaced with a single FET in common, degradation of the frequency performance due to dispersion of the FET characteristics may be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In addition, when the attenuator unit 100 is produced by using an MMIC technique, because of reduction of a chip area for the attenuator unit 100, design cost may be reduced.
      <br/>
      Also, since the number of chips obtainable from one wafer increases, mass production of the attenuator unit becomes possible.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The above-discussed FET is operative as a resistor in an on condition, and operative as a capacitor in an off condition.
      <br/>
      A gate voltage when a drain current starts to flow, namely a pinch-off voltage, is, for example, -0.8 V. Therefore, as the gate voltage of the FET in its normal operation, a voltage apart from the pinch-off voltage, such as 0 V and -3 V, is applied.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      However, when a voltage adjacent to the pinch-off voltage is applied to the gate of the FET, the FET operates with having characteristics of both the resistor and the capacitor.
      <br/>
      In this case, the attenuator unit may have an analog attenuation value according to the control voltage applied to the gate of the FET.
      <br/>
      Namely, when the control voltage is selected near the pinch-off voltage, the attenuator unit operates as a variable attenuator whose attenuation value can be continuously varied.

    <p num="58">
      FIG. 7 shows a schematic diagram of the first embodiment of the step attenuator according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      A step attenuator 150 shown in FIG. 7 includes three attenuator units 110-1, 110-2, 110-3 which are connected in series.
      <br/>
      Each of these attenuator units 110-1, 110-2, 110-3 has the same configuration as that of the attenuator unit 110 shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Values of resistors in each attenuator unit are determined such that a fixed attenuation value of each attenuator unit has a given attenuation value.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      For example, in the attenuator unit 110-1, with 11- OMEGA , 436- OMEGA , 436- OMEGA  resistors, a  PI -type attenuator having a 2-dB attenuation value is constructed.
      <br/>
      In the same way, in the attenuator unit 110-2, with 24- OMEGA , 220- OMEGA , 220- OMEGA  resistors, a  PI -type attenuator having a 4-dB attenuation value is constructed.
      <br/>
      In the attenuator unit 110-3, with 53- OMEGA , 116- OMEGA , 116- OMEGA  resistors, a  PI -type attenuator having an 8-dB attenuation value is constructed.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      FETs included in the attenuator units 110-1, 110-2, 110-3 are respectively controlled by external control signals S1, S2, S3.
      <br/>
      For example, when all the attenuator units are operated as attenuators by the external control signals S1, S2, S3, the step attenuator 150 may have an attenuation value of 14 dB.
      <br/>
      When only the attenuator unit 110-3 is operated as an attenuator, the step attenuator 150 may have an attenuation value of 8 dB.
      <br/>
      In this way, the attenuation value of the step attenuator 150 may be selected from 0 dB to 14 dB in a 2-dB step.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      In the step attenuator using the attenuator unit according to the present invention, since each attenuator unit has a simple configuration, over all size of the step attenuator may be miniaturized and simplified.
      <br/>
      Further, since each attenuator unit has good frequency performance, the step attenuator according to the present invention may have better frequency performance than that of the step attenuator having the prior-art attenuator unit.
    </p>
    <p num="62">In the step attenuator 150 of the first embodiment, when each attenuator unit operates as an attenuator, and when a large power input signal is applied, the following problem may occur.</p>
    <p num="63">
      When the attenuator unit regularly operates, high-frequency power generated in the resistor of the shunt side is transferred to ground through the FET in the shunt side.
      <br/>
      However, when the power of the input signal increases and the high-frequency power increases, a part of the high-frequency power may not be transferred to ground, and may be transmitted to an output terminal through the other side resistor in the shunt side.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a desired attenuation value may not be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      On the contrary, in the prior-art attenuator unit having the two FETs in the shunt side shown in FIG. 4, the high-frequency power generated in the one side resistor (for example, R42) of the shunt side does not flow into the other side resistor (for example, R43) of the shunt side.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the prior-art attenuator unit, for the large high-frequency power, the desired attenuation value is substantially obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="65">In the following, a comparison of attenuation characteristics of the attenuator unit according to the present invention and the prior-art attenuator unit will be discussed.</p>
    <p num="66">
      FIG. 8 shows attenuation characteristics of the attenuator unit according to the present invention shown in FIG. 6 and the prior-art attenuator unit shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The horizontal axis indicates a designed attenuation value, and the vertical axis indicates a measured attenuation value.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 8, under the designed attenuation value of 8 dB, in both the attenuator units, the same attenuation value as the designed attenuation value is measured.
      <br/>
      However, in the designed attenuation value of more than 10 dB, the measured attenuation value of the attenuator unit according to the present invention separates from the designed attenuation value.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      On the other hand, in the prior-art attenuator unit, even in the designed attenuation value more than 10 dB, substantially the same attenuation value as the designed attenuation value is measured.
      <br/>
      In the prior-art attenuator unit, a difference between a theoretical value (the designed value) and the measured value seems to be due to a loss in the FET, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      As mentioned above, an example in FIG. 8 shows that, in the designed attenuation value less than 8 dB, the attenuator unit according to the present invention effectively operates.
      <br/>
      Therefore, by applying the attenuator unit according to the present invention to a part of the step attenuator using the prior-art attenuator unit, a smaller-sized step attenuator having good performance may be realized.
      <br/>
      Next, a configuration and operation of such a step attenuator will be discussed.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      FIG. 9 shows a schematic diagram of a second embodiment of the step attenuator according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      A step attenuator 160 shown in FIG. 9 includes two attenuator units 110-4, 110-5, and an attenuator unit 40-1, which are connected in series.
      <br/>
      Each of the attenuator units 110-4, 110-5 has the same configuration as that of the attenuator unit 110 shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The attenuator unit 40-1 has the same configuration as that of the attenuator unit 40 shown in FIG. 4.
    </p>
    <p num="70">Values of resistors in each attenuator unit are determined such that a fixed attenuation value of each attenuator unit has a given attenuation value.</p>
    <p num="71">
      For example, in the attenuator unit 110-4, with 17- OMEGA , 292- OMEGA , 292- OMEGA  resistors, a fixed attenuator having a 3-dB attenuation value is constructed.
      <br/>
      In the same way, in the attenuator unit 110-5, with 24- OMEGA , 150- OMEGA , 150- OMEGA  resistors, a fixed attenuator having a 6-dB attenuation value is constructed.
      <br/>
      In the attenuator unit 40-1, with 93- OMEGA , 84- OMEGA , 84- OMEGA  resistors, a fixed attenuator having a 12-dB attenuation value is constructed.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      In the attenuator units 110-4, 110-5, the FET in the shunt side is designed such that when the FET is in a conductive condition, a resistance value of the FET is sufficiently small as compared to the resistance values (292  OMEGA , 150  OMEGA ) of the resistors in the shunt side.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a total attenuation value of the step attenuator 160 may be selected from 0 dB to 21 dB in 3-dB steps.
    </p>
    <p num="73">Further, since the attenuator unit 40-1 is constructed with a  PI -type structure having two FETs in the shunt side, the attenuator unit 40-1 may have good attenuation performance even for a relatively large attenuation value.</p>
    <p num="74">In the step attenuator 160 according to the present invention, for the attenuator unit 40-1 having a relatively large attenuation value, for example, 12 dB, the prior-art attenuator unit as shown in FIG. 4 is used for obtaining good attenuation performance, and for the attenuator units 110-4, 110-5 having a relatively small attenuation value, for example, 3 dB and 6 dB, the attenuator units according to the present invention as shown in FIG. 6 are used for miniaturizing the step-attenuator size.</p>
    <p num="75">Therefore, the second embodiment of the step attenuator according to the present invention may be miniaturized and may have good attenuation performance even for a relatively large attenuation value.</p>
    <p num="76">Next, a description will be given of an inverter circuit according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="77">
      FIG. 10 shows a schematic diagram of a first embodiment of the inverter circuit according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      An inverter circuit 200 shown in FIG. 10 includes a D-FET 202, and three resistors R1, R2, R3.
      <br/>
      The resistor R1 is connected between a drain of the D-FET 202 and a power-supply voltage Vcc, the resistor R2 is connected between a source of the D-FET 202 and ground, and the resistor R3 is connected between a gate of the D-FET 202 and the ground.
      <br/>
      A input signal is supplied to the gate of the D-FET 202.
    </p>
    <p num="78">In the inverter circuit 200, a resistance value of the resistor R2 is set to a value (absolute value of the pinch-off voltage/a current between the drain and the source), and a resistance value of the resistor R3 is set to be more than several k OMEGA .</p>
    <p num="79">
      When a given voltage is applied between the drain and the source, a current according to a gate width of the D-FET 202 flows into the resistor R2.
      <br/>
      Therefore, reverse electromotive force is generated across the resistor R2, and a negative voltage of the reverse electromotive force is applied to the resistor R3 to produce a self-bias.
      <br/>
      In this case, by selecting the resistance value of the resistor R2 so as to produce the same reverse electromotive force as the voltage supplied to the gate, the D-FET 202 may be operated in a pinch-off condition.
      <br/>
      In this way, a self-bias circuit is formed, and an operational point is set to be in the pinch-off condition.
    </p>
    <p num="80">As a result, when a 0-V voltage is applied to the gate of the D-FET 202, the D-FET 202 is turned off, and when a V1 voltage is applied to the gate, the D-FET 202 is turned on (V1 is a given voltage enabling the D-FET 202 to turn on).</p>
    <p num="81">
      Next, an output voltage Vout in this case will be discussed.
      <br/>
      In the following discussion, when the D-FET 202 is turned on, a resistance value of the D-FET 202 is referred to as Ron, and when the D-FET 202 is turned off, the resistance value thereof is referred to as Roff.
      <br/>
      When the input voltage is 0 V:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      In this way, when the input voltage is 0 V, the output voltage Vout becomes Vcc.
      <br/>
      When the input voltage is V1:
      <br/>
      Vout=(R2+Ron)/(R1+R2+Ron) * Vcc.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Since a value (R2+Ron)/(R1+R2+Ron) is less than 1, when the input voltage is V1, the output voltage Vout becomes lower than Vcc (the output voltage Vout at that time is referred to as V2).
      <br/>
      In this case, the resistance value of the resistor R1 is determined so that the output voltage can be decided to be a logical low level.
    </p>
    <p num="84">In this way, from the drain of the D-FET 202, an inverted signal of the input signal supplied to the gate of the D-FET 202 may be obtained.</p>
    <p num="85">
      As mentioned above, even with the configuration having a single FET, the inverter circuit may be provided.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the inverter circuit 200 according to the present invention may be miniaturized as compared to the prior-art inverter circuit 50 having two FETs shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      Further, inverter-circuit design may also be simplified, and, thus, inverter-circuit cost can be reduced.

      A control signal S is supplied to a gate of the D-FET 242, and an inverted signal, which is produced by the control signal S being inverted in the inverter circuit 200-1, is supplied to a gate of the D-FET 244.

      Radio equipment shown in FIG. 14 comprises a transmission part and a reception part.
