    <p num="2">

      <br/>
      Field Of The Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a color toner which is useful in image forming methods which include a step in which an electrostatic latent image is developed such as electrophotography, electrostatic recording and electrostatic printing, and to a method of manufacture of the color toner and to a method of image formation using the color toner.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Background</p>
    <p num="5">
      In image forming methods such as electrophotography, electrostatic recording and electrostatic printing, toner is generally used for developing an electrostatic latent image.
      <br/>
      The toner is required to be constituted of fine particles which are evenly charged and which have good fluidity.
      <br/>
      As to methods for developing an electrostatic latent image, two-methods are known, one of which is a developing method which employs a two-component developer, which includes a mixture of a toner and a carrier and the other of which is a developing method which uses a one-component developer which includes a toner but does not include a carrier.
      <br/>
      The developing method using a two-component developer has an advantage in that good images can be stably obtained, but the method has drawbacks which include that a carrier therein tends to deteriorate and the toner/carrier mixing ratio tends to change, resulting in deterioration of image qualities of the developed images.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the image forming methods mentioned above, a developed toner image on a photoconductor is generally transferred to a transfer sheet and the transferred image is then fixed to obtain a fixed image.
      <br/>
      As for fixing methods, a heat roller fixing method is typically used in which a transfer sheet having a developed toner image thereon is heated while the sheet is pressed upon passage through a pair of heat rollers.
      <br/>
      This heat roller fixing method has an advantage in that a developed toner image can be quickly fixed, because the fixing method has high heat efficiency.
      <br/>
      However, a drawback of the method is the so-called offset problem which tends to occur in which an image which has transferred onto a transfer sheet, transfers instead to a heated roller and the image which has been transferred onto the roller is then transferred to another area of the transfer sheet or another transfer sheet, resulting in occurrence of undesirable images.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In attempting to solve these problems, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2-235067 discloses a developer which includes toner particles which include a release agent therein and thereon, each in a proper mixing ratio.
      <br/>
      The toner has releasability, however, the toner exhibits drawbacks such as poor fluidity and poor preservability, and has an uneven charge distribution which results in deterioration of image qualities, because the release agent is added onto the surface of the toner.
      <br/>
      In addition, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 3-168649 discloses a developer including a toner in which a wax having low molecular weight, which serves as a release agent, is dispersed, by kneading with application of a large sheer strength is applied for a long time, in the binder resin of the toner so that the particle size of the dispersed wax is 1  MU m or less.
      <br/>
      This technique tends to avoid the offset problem by controlling the particle diameter of the dispersed release agent, but has drawbacks in that the resultant toner has high manufacturing costs, because the kneading apparatus, which is capable of applying such high shear strength is limited and expensive, and the productivity of the method is low because of the long kneading times required.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Further, demands currently exist for color reproduction methods which provide images having good color image qualities.
      <br/>
      For example, color toners such as yellow, magenta and cyan toners, and optionally a black toner, are used to prepare full color electrophotographic images.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that these color toners exhibit good light reflection properties without exhibiting random reflection, and good transparency so that any mixed color image prepared has a desired color when the color toners are overlaid.
      <br/>
      In addition, the color toners preferably have a relatively small particle size, so that developed color toner images have good resolution and sharpness.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is necessary to improve the dispersion of a coloring agent in a binder resin of a color toner.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A toner is generally formed of a binder resin, a coloring agent (a dye, a pigment, a magnetizable material and/or the like), and a charge controlling agent.
      <br/>
      These toner materials are melted and mixed by kneading, and then pulverized after solidification by cooling.
      <br/>
      The pulverized toner is then classified to prepare toner particles having a desired particle diameter.
      <br/>
      The thus obtained toner particles are mixed with an additive such as a colloidal silica to prepare a toner having good fluidity.
      <br/>
      Extrusion type continuous kneaders having a screw, two-roller mills, three-roller mills, kneaders which can heat and press, or the like have been conventionally used for kneading these toner materials.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In a color toner, the dispersion of a coloring agent in a binder resin depends on the kneading process employed in manufacture of the color toner, and when the dispersion is not satisfactory, the resultant toner is poorly colored and has poor clearness and transparency, resulting in serious deterioration of the color reproducibility of formed color images.
      <br/>
      In the kneading apparatus mentioned above, the dispersion of a coloring agent in a toner is not satisfactory, and, therefore, images having good image qualities cannot be obtained.
      <br/>
      In attempting to solve this problem, so-called toner master batch methods are disclosed.
      <br/>
      For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 3-155568 discloses a toner manufacturing method which includes a step in which a toner master batch is first prepared by melting and kneading a mixture of a portion of a binder resin, a coloring agent and a solvent and then cooling and pulverizing the mixture, and another step in which the toner master batch and the remainder of the binder resin are melted and kneaded.
      <br/>
      This method tends to improve the dispersion of the coloring agent in the binder resin by adding a solvent, but the method has a drawback in that it takes a long time to obtain a desired color toner in which the particles of the coloring agent are dispersed in the binder resin in a desired particle size.
      <br/>
      This is because the mixture, including the solvent, has relatively low melt viscosity and, therefore, it is difficult to improve the dispersion of the coloring agent.
      <br/>
      In addition, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 8-146662 discloses a toner which includes a plurality of coloring agents which are different from each other only with respect to particle size distribution.
      <br/>
      This toner requires at least two toner master batches which are prepared by changing kneading conditions so that each toner master batch includes a coloring agent having a different particle size distribution.
      <br/>
      However, the thus obtained toner cannot necessarily produce good images and in addition the method has a drawback of low productivity, because it is necessary to prepare at least two master batches to make the toner.
      <br/>
      Therefore, these toners are not satisfactory.
      <br/>
      Because of these reasons, a need exists for a color toner which is useful for developing an electrostatic latent image which can produce full color images having good image qualities and which can be effectively manufactured.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a color toner which is useful for developing a latent electrostatic image, which is formed by electrophotography or the like, which can produce full color images having good color reproducibility and good resolution without undesired images such as white spots and offset images.</p>
    <p num="12">Another object of the present invention is to provide a color toner which does not scatter toner particles, which results in contamination of an image forming apparatus and the fouling of the background of formed images.</p>
    <p num="13">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacture of the color toner mentioned above.</p>
    <p num="14">Still another object of the present invention is to provide an image forming method by which full color images having good image qualities without white spots and the like can be prepared.</p>
    <p num="15">Briefly, these objects and other objects of the present invention as hereinafter will become more readily apparent can be attained by a color toner which comprises a binder resin, a coloring agent, a release agent and a charge controlling agent, wherein the release agent dispersed in the binder resin has an average particle diameter of from about 0.1 to about 2  MU m and wherein a fixed color toner image, which is developed and fixed using the toner, has a Haze factor less than about 20% when the image has an image density of 1.5.</p>
    <p num="16">
      In another aspect of the invention, the toner is prepared by heating a mixture of the binder resin, the coloring agent and the release agent to a melt, and then kneading the mixture, followed by cooling and pulverizing the mixture to prepare a master batch of the toner.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the master batch is combined with an additional amount of the binder resin or an additional binder resin and the charge controlling agent, and the mixture is heated to a melt, and then kneaded, cooled, and pulverized to complete the preparation of the toner.
    </p>
    <p num="17">In still another aspect of the invention, a full color image is formed by forming a latent electrostatic image on a photoconductor which is then subjected to reversal-development using one of the color toners of the present invention which is held on a magnetic brush in one of plural developing members which are installed in a developing unit which rotates so that an electrostatic latent image can be developed with any color toner included in the plural developing members.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading>
    <p num="18">
      Various other objects features and attendant advantages of the present invention will be more fully appreciated as the same becomes better understood from the detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing in which like reference characters designate like corresponding parts throughout and wherein:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a partial cross-sectional view illustrating a toner image forming section of an embodiment of a full color image forming apparatus useful in the image forming method of the present invention.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="19">
      In electrophotography, full color images can be generally obtained by using yellow, magenta and cyan toners and optionally a black toner.
      <br/>
      For example, a red image can be formed by overlying a magenta toner image on a yellow toner image, and a blue image can be formed by overlying a cyan toner image on a magenta toner image.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The present inventors have discovered the that color reproducibility of reproduced images depends on the state of dispersion of the release agent in toner particles and the Haze factor of the toner.
      <br/>
      That is, in a toner prepared from a binder resin, a coloring agent, a charge controlling agent and a release agent, the average particle diameter of the release agent in the toner particles preferably ranges from about 0.1 to about 2  MU m, and more preferably from about 0.6 to about 1.3  MU m, and the Haze factor of the fixed color toner image, which is obtained by fixation of the toner image prepared, is not greater than about 20% when the image has an image density of 1.5. By controlling the particle diameter of the release agent and the Haze factor of the toner image to preferred ranges, the resultant toner has good releasability, which results in prevention of the offset problem and the so-called "a nail-mark problem" in which nails used to separate an image receiving material from a fixing roller scratches images, because the toner image adheres to the fixing roller because of the poor releasability of the toner, resulting in formation of white streaks.
      <br/>
      In addition, the resultant toner has good transparency, good charging properties, good color properties and good preservability, and consequently the resultant images exhibit the desired image qualities even when the toner is used for a long time.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The average particle diameter of the coloring agent is preferably not greater than 1  MU m, and more preferably from about 0.2 to about 0.7  MU m in order to maintain good color reproducibility of the images which are formed.
      <br/>
      When the softening point of the binder resin is Tsr ( (degree)  C.) and the flow starting temperature of the binder resin is Tfr ( (degree)  C.), the release agent preferably has a melting point, Mpw, which is within the range:
      <br/>
      (Tsr+5)( (degree)  C.)&lt;Mpw&lt;(Tfr-5)(0C).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The particle diameter of the release agent and the coloring agent can be measured by a variety of methods.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, particle diameter is measured as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="23">(1) A toner particle is buried in a thermosetting resin and the resin is then crosslinked;</p>
    <p num="24">(2) The resin, including the toner particle, is sliced so as to have a thickness of 1000  Angstrom  with a microtome MT-6000 (manufactured by R. M. C. Inc.);</p>
    <p num="25">(3) The cross-section of the toner particle is observed with a transmittance electron microscope JSM-880 (manufactured by JEOL Ltd.); and</p>

    <p num="30">
      (3) The image density of each fixed solid toner image is measured with a color-difference meter (Spectrodensitometer), X-rite.

    <p num="34">The present inventors have discovered that the offset problem can be avoided when the melting point of the release agent included in the toner is greater than about (Tsr+5)( (degree)  C.) and less than about (Tfr-5)( (degree)  C.), wherein Tsr and Tfr represent the softening point of the binder resin employed in the toner and the flow starting point of the binder resin, respectively.</p>
    <p num="35">
      By controlling the melting point of the release agent to within this range, the release agent melts while the binder resin of the toner softens.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the release agent with a proper particle diameter can be evenly dispersed in the binder resin.
      <br/>
      The toner of the present invention may include a plurality of release agents and binder resins.
      <br/>
      In this case, when the melting point of each release agent and the softening point and the flow starting point of each binder resin are in the same relationship as mentioned above, the offset problem can be avoided.

    <p num="72">
      As to the method of manufacture which is employed to prepare the toner of the present invention, various methods can be employed.
      <br/>
      However, the toner exhibits particularly good performance when the toner is manufactured by the method mentioned hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Conventionally, large shear strength and long kneading times are required to manufacture a toner master batch which includes all of a binder resin, a coloring agent, a release agent and a charge controlling agent which constitute a toner.
      <br/>
      In addition, since a kneader such as a roll mill is normally used to manufacture the toner master batch, which cannot continuously manufacture the toner master batch, productivity of the toner is adversedly affected.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      In the present invention, by preparing a toner master batch in which a three-component mixture of a binder resin, a coloring agent and release agent are preliminary melt and kneaded, a good master batch in which the coloring agent and the release agent are uniformly dispersed in the binder resin can be obtained.
      <br/>
      It is believed that the release agent serves as a dispersant for the coloring agent which generally has large oil absorption and, therefore, the coloring agent can be easily dispersed in the melted release agent, resulting in dramatic improvement of the dispersion of the coloring agent in the binder resin.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the toner of the present invention can be manufactured with apparatuses which can continuously knead a toner master batch, but cannot be used for manufacturing a conventional toner master batch because they cannot apply high shear strength to the toner master batch, resulting in increase of efficiency of toner production.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The thus obtained toner master batch is then completed by adding a charge controlling agent and an additional binder resin to the mixed materials, which may be the same as or different from the resin included in the toner master batch, and the mixture is melted and kneaded with a kneader such as a two-roller mill, a three-roller mill, a kneader capable of applying heat and pressure or the like to obtain a toner for a developer useful for full color reproduction by electrophotography or the like.
      <br/>
      By using this toner manufacturing method, the resultant toner is desirably colored even when the content of the coloring agent in the binder resin is relatively low, and thereby a toner which has good transparency and which can produce images having good image qualities can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In addition, by using this method, an extrusion type continuous kneader using a screw can be used for manufacturing the toner, resulting in increase of efficiency of toner production.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      It is well-known that when a mixture of a binder resin and a coloring agent is melted and kneaded to prepare a toner master batch, a substantial shear strength is needed to finely disperse the coloring agent in the binder resin.
      <br/>
      In this case, if a release agent is added to the obtained toner master batch, and the mixture is further melted and kneaded to make a toner, the resultant toner is inferior to the toner prepared by the method of the present invention with respect to coloring properties and transparency of toner.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      Further, it is necessary to prepare a toner having a relatively small particle diameter for obtaining images having good resolution, however, generally, the smaller the particle diameter of a toner including the release agent, the worse the fluidity and preservability of the toner.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the toner of the present invention prepared by the method mentioned above can have good fluidity and preservability even when the toner has a volume average particle diameter less than about 9  MU m. Therefore, in the present invention a good toner can be obtained which can produce images having good resolution while having good fluidity and preservability.
      <br/>
      The coloring agent is preferably included in the toner master batch in a high content in the range mentioned above to prepare a good toner in which the coloring agent is finely and uniformly dispersed.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      When a toner master batch of the toner of the present invention is prepared, the preferred contents of the coloring agent and the release agent are respectively from about 10 to about 40 parts by weight and from about 10 to about 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the toner master batch.
      <br/>
      Such a toner master batch provides a toner which can effectively produce images having good image qualities and which has good fluidity and preservability.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The toner block which is obtained in the process is cooled and crushed with a crusher such as a hammer mill or the like, and in addition finely pulverized with a pulverizer such as a jet mill, a mechanical pulverizer or the like, and then classified with a classifier such as a jet air classifier, a mechanical classifier or the like to prepare a toner having a desired particle diameter.
      <br/>
      A fluidity controlling agent can be added to the resultant toner, if desired.
