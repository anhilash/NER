    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The invention relates to a binder for loose sheets of paper.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention relates to a binder designed to prevent the removal and unauthorized copying of bound documents.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Unauthorized copying of documents is a problem which costs those in the document preparation business great sums of money.
      <br/>
      For example, stenography services are often used to transcribe legal proceedings, for example, depositions, court room arguments, meetings, etc.
      <br/>
      In addition to charging for the service of simply transcribing the proceedings, stenography services are also in the business of providing transcripts of the transcribed proceedings.
      <br/>
      In fact, most stenography services retain the rights to the transcribed materials and require that the customer purchase additional copies from the service.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      While such an arrangement allows the stenography services to make additional money, it also helps those involved with the legal proceeding to maintain the integrity of the voluminous records developed during a legal proceeding.
      <br/>
      Specifically, when copies of transcripts are purchased directly from the stenography service, these copies are certified as true and accurate recordings of the original proceedings.
      <br/>
      When these transcripts are unbound and copied, papers are often lost and the integrity of the file is destroyed.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Unfortunately, many individuals involved with legal proceedings simply order a single copy of the transcript, copy it, and retain the original copy for court submission purposes.
      <br/>
      As discussed above, this often leads to inaccuracies and lost integrity of the files relating to the legal action, as well as lost income to the service that created the transcript.
      <br/>
      The cost for recreating such files greatly surpasses the simple cost of maintaining an integrally bound transcript and purchasing additional copies from the stenography service.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      As such, a need exists for a binding system which allows simple binding of loose papers while also ensuring the integrity of the transcript by preventing the unauthorized removal and copying of the bound transcript.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides such a binding system.
    </p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="19">
      The detailed embodiment of the present invention is disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      It should be understood, however, that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limited, but merely as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      With reference to FIGS. 1 to 5, a copy safe binder 10 in accordance with the present invention is disclosed.
      <br/>
      The binder 10 is substantially similar to traditional prong/tab binding systems.
      <br/>
      As such, the binder 10 includes a front cover member 12 and a rear cover member 14.
      <br/>
      The front cover member 12 is provided with a front panel 16 and an integral front coupling flap 18.
      <br/>
      The rear cover member 14 is similar provided with a rear panel 20 and an integral rear coupling flap 22.
      <br/>
      For reasons that will be better appreciated from the following disclosure, the front and rear cover members 12, 14 are substantially the same size, although variations in their size and shape may be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The front cover member 12 includes an exterior surface 24 and an interior surface 26.
      <br/>
      The rear cover member 14 also includes an exterior surface 28 and an interior surface 30.
      <br/>
      In practice, the front coupling flap 18 and the rear coupling flap 22 are folded along respective fold lines 32, 34 on the front and rear cover members 12, 14 such that their exterior surfaces 24f, 28f meet to form a standard binder in which loose sheets 36 may be placed.
      <br/>
      When the binder 10 is coupled in this manner, the front panel 16 and the rear panel 20 cover the bound loosed sheets 36, while the front coupling flap 18 and the rear coupling flap 22 bind the loose sheets within the binder.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      With this in mind, the front coupling flap 18 is shaped and dimensioned for attachment with the rear coupling flap 22.
      <br/>
      The front coupling flap 18 includes a plurality of prongs 38 spaced for receipt within apertures 40 formed in the rear coupling flap 22.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the front coupling flap 18 is provided with three equally spaced prongs 38 and the rear coupling flap 22 is provided with three similarly spaced apertures 40.
      <br/>
      However, other binding arrangements may be employed without departing from the spirit of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In use, the prongs 38 are passed through the apertures found in the loose sheets 36 to be bound.
      <br/>
      The exterior surface 24f of the front coupling flap 18 and the exterior surface 28f of the rear coupling flap 22 are then brought together with the loose sheets 36 therebetween.
      <br/>
      As the front coupling flap 18 and the rear coupling flap 22 are brought together, the prongs 38 of the front coupling flap 18 are passed through the apertures 40 in the rear coupling flap 22, and the exterior surfaces 24f, 28f of the front and rear coupling flaps 18, 22 are pushed together to secure the loose sheets 36 therebetween.
      <br/>
      Once the loose sheets 36 are properly aligned, the prongs 38 may be bent over to securely coupled the front coupling flap 18, and the front cover member 12, to the rear coupling flap 22, and the rear cover member 14 (see FIGS. 3 and 4).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Prevention of the unauthorized removal and copying of the bound loose sheets is achieved by the inclusion of an adhesive strip 42, or security strip, on the rear cover member 14.
      <br/>
      A release strip 44 covers the adhesive strip 42 until it is desired to secure the interior surface 30f of the rear coupling flap 22 to the adhesive strip 42.
      <br/>
      When it is desired to seal the binder 10, the release strip 44 is removed and the adhesive strip 42 is brought in contact with rear coupling flap 22 (see FIG. 5).
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Specifically, and with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, the adhesive strip 42 is positioned along the interior surface 30p of the rear cover panel 20 adjacent the fold line 34 for the rear coupling flap 22.
      <br/>
      As such, the adhesive strip 42 is positioned to engage the interior surface 30f of the rear coupling flap 22 and the prongs 38 when the rear coupling flap 22 is folded down after attachment of the loose sheets 36 between the front and rear cover members 12, 14.
      <br/>
      Once the adhesive strip 42 securely engages the interior surface 30f of the rear coupling flap 22, ready access to the prongs 38 is prevented and it is impossible to remove the bound loose sheets 36 without destroying the fully assembled binder 10.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      With reference to FIGS. 2 to 5, a stack of loose sheets 36 is bound in the following manner.
      <br/>
      First, and as discussed above, the prongs 38 of the front coupling flap 18 are passed through apertures found in the loose sheets 36 to be bound.
      <br/>
      The exterior surface 24f of the front coupling flap 18 and the exterior surface 28f of the rear coupling flap 22 are then brought together with the loose sheets 36 therebetween, and the prongs 38 of the front coupling flap 18 are passed through the apertures 40 in the rear coupling flap 22.
      <br/>
      The prongs 38 are then bent over to securely coupled the front coupling flap 18 to the rear coupling flap 22.
      <br/>
      The release strip 44 is then removed to expose the adhesive strip 42.
      <br/>
      The binder 10 is then folded along the front fold line 32 and the rear fold line 34, bringing the adhesive strip 42 into contact with the interior surface 30f of the rear coupling flap 22.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Attachment of the adhesive strip 42 to the interior surface 30f of the rear coupling flap 22 binds the interior surface 30f of the rear coupling flap 22 to the interior surface 30p of the rear cover panel 20.
      <br/>
      In this way, the prongs 38 are covered between the rear coupling flap 22 and the rear cover panel 20.
      <br/>
      As such, the bound loose sheets 36 may not be removed without destroying the fully assembled binder 10.
      <br/>
      This arrangement prevents individuals from removing loose sheets 36 from a bound transcript for copying, and ultimately ensures the integrity of the bound transcript, or other document.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      With this in mind, the binder 10 is preferably provided with a notice 46 indicating that the binder 10 has been tampered with if the seal between the interior surface 30f of the rear coupling flap 22 and the interior surface 30p of the cover panel 20 is broken in anyway.
      <br/>
      For example, the notice 46 might state "This transcript cover has been sealed to protect the transcript's integrity.
      <br/>
      Breaking the seal will void the reporter's certification page.
      <br/>
      To purchase a copy of this transcript, please call the phone number listed on the bottom of the transcript page" .
      <br/>
      While such a notice is employed with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the notice may be varied, or no notice may be included, without departing from the spirit of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="29">While the preferred embodiment has been shown and described, it will be understood that there is no intent to limit the invention by such disclosure, but rather, is intended to cover all modifications and alternate constructions falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
