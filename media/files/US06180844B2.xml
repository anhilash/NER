    <p num="1">Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a composition containing a fluorescence-generating substrate or fluorescent dye precursor.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it relates to a composition and methods useful in detecting biological analytes.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Heretofore, radioactive isotopes, coloring substrates, as well as fluorescent dyes and their precursors (or fluorescence generating substrates) have been widely used to detect biological analytes.
      <br/>
      In particular, fluorescence-generating substrates are now widely used and studied for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, in which an alkali phosphatase or peroxidase is used as the labeling enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      For example, 2', 7'-clichlorofluorescein is a fluorescence-generating substrate (or fluorescence-generating compound) capable of being used in reaction systems comprising peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide (A. S. Ferrer, et al.
      <br/>
      Anal. Biochem., 187, 129 (1990)).
      <br/>
      In that reaction system, in general, coloring substrates such as diaminobenzidine derivatives are often used because of their color stability, although their sensitivity is lower than that of fluorescence-generating substrates (for example, see P. D. Josephy, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 258, 5561 (1983); E. Sheldon, et al., Clin. Chem., 33, 1368 (1987)).

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      Tile object of the present invention is to provide a novel means of using fluorescence-generating substrates, which is free from the problems of the prior art, noted above.
      <br/>
      In particular, this invention solves the shortcomings of fluorescence-generating substrates that are used on solid supports.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the object of the invention is to provide improved fluorescence-generating substrates which generate fluorescent dyes having reduced mobility on solid supports, and also to provide a method of using these substrates.
    </p>
    <p num="8">After studying the behavior of various compounds in reaction systems comprising peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide, we have found that various p-hydroxyphenyl derivatives, which have lower water solubility than that of 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, noted above, can form substantially water-insoluble fluorescent dyes in the reaction system, and that the possibility of those dyes being formed on solid biological samples is extremely low.</p>
    <p num="9">Accordingly, to attain the object noted above, the invention provides a composition for forming fluorescent dyes in oxidative environments, which is characterized by containing a fluorescence-generating substrate (or fluorescent dye precursor) of a formula (1):  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The terminology "fluorescence-generating substrate" as referred to herein is meant to indicate a compound which generates a fluorescent dye, after having been oxidized in an oxidative environment; for example, after oxidation in a reaction system comprising peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide.
      <br/>
      The terminology "fluorescent dye" also referred to herein is meant to include compounds capable of generating fluorescence after absorbing radiation, as well as specific coloring dyes which do not emit light having satisfactory intensity after absorbing radiation, but which can be detected by any spectrometric means.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The lower alkyl groups, and the allkyl moiety of the lower alkoxy groups of R1 and R2 in formula (I), are defined as linear or branched alkyl groups having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of the alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, tert-pentyl and n-hexyl groups.
      <br/>
      Methyl groups are especially preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The aryl groups include, for example, phenyl, tolyl and naphthyl groups which may be substituted by any of hydroxyl, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy groups, or halogen atoms.
      <br/>
      Phenyl groups are especially preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      At least one of R1 and R2 is preferably a hydrogen atom.
      <br/>
      Where both R1 and R2 are not hydrogen atoms, they are preferably any of a methyl group or a methoxy group.
    </p>
    <p num="19">L is --NHCO-- or --CONH--.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Y is -alkylene-COOH, where alkylene is a linear or branched C1-6 alkylene group.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, Y is formula (II):  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      where R3, R4 and R5 each independently represent a group as defined above for R1 and R2, or a carboxyl group; or two of R3, R4 and R5 are groups that form, together with the adjacent carbon atoms to which they bond, a fused 5-membered or 6-membered hydrocarbon ring.
      <br/>
      R3, R4 and R5 may be bonded to the carbon atoms at any position in the benzene ring, as long as the compounds of formula (I) meet the object of the invention.
      <br/>
      When R3, R4 and R5, are bulky substituents, however, it is desirable that they be attached to the ring para to the linking group, L. Two of R3, R4 and R5 may form, together with the adjacent carbon atoms to which they bond, a 5-membered or 6-membered hydrocarbon ring, fused to the benzene ring to which it bonds.
      <br/>
      In that case, the fused ring structure may be represented by:  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      When Y is -alkylene-COOH, the alkylene group may include metlhylene, ethylene, trimethylene, propylene, tetramethylene, isopropylmethylene, pentamethylene, hexamethylene, 2-isopropyltrimethylene.
      <br/>
      Pentamethylene and hexamethylene are preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Preferred examples of the combination of the moieties in formula (I) are as follow.
      <br/>
      When a is 0, it is preferable that L is --NHCO-- and Y is formula (II):  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="24">When a is 1, it is preferable that L is --CONH-- and Y is alkylene-COOH.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Some of the compounds of formula (I) are known, or can be produced by known methods.
      <br/>
      Other novel compounds of formula (I) could be produced by anyone skilled in the art, for example, according to the methods described in the Production Examples.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      It is presumed that the p-hydroxyplhenyl derivatives of formula (I), used in the present invention, will covalently bond with each other at the ortho-position relative to the hydroxyl group in oxidative environments, to produce dimerized or trimerized fluorescent dyes.
      <br/>
      The fluorescent dyes thus formed are, in general, barely soluble in aqueous media.
      <br/>
      In addition, they have the ability to bind to, or have an affinity for porous synthetic resins such as polyurethane or the like, on specific synthetic resin membranes such as nylon membranes, nitrocellulose membranes, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes or the like, on chromosomes in cell preparations, or on solid biological samples such as tissues, or the like.
      <br/>
      In particular, when the solid supports carry nucleic acids, the binding ability of the dyes is significantly enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The composition of the invention generally comprises the fluorescence-generating substrate of formula (I), along with a suitable solvent.
      <br/>
      The substrate may be incorporated into the composition in the form of a solution or suspension.
      <br/>
      If it is desired that the composition contain a solution of the substrate, the substrate can be dissolved in an aqueous medium that contains a water-miscible, organic co-solvent, such as dimethylformamide, acetonitrile or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The oxidative environments referred to herein include any environment in which the fluorescence-generating substrates of formula (I) can be converted into fluorescent dyes.
      <br/>
      One preferred example is a reaction system comprising peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide.
      <br/>
      The peroxidase may be typically horseradish peroxidase.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The "solid support" to which peroxidase binds, as referred to herein, includes, for example, porous carriers of synthetic resin such as polyurethane or the like, and synthetic resin membranes of nylon, nitrocellulose, PVDF and the like, such as those mentioned above, as well as biological samples.
      <br/>
      Specifically, biological samples include animal and vegetable tissue slices, cell preparations, chromosomes, tissue cells and others as prepared for histochemical studies.
      <br/>
      The peroxidase binds to supports, Such as the above-mentioned, by reacting, bonding, or complexing with nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) present on the porous carrier or a polymer membrane, or nutcleic acids present in biological samples.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the peroxidase can complex with a nucleic acid probe, a hapten or the like.
      <br/>
      For example, peroxidase may bind to an antigen or antibody on a support, in the form of an antigen-peroxidase labeled antibody or an antibody-antigen-peroxidase labeled antibody.
      <br/>
      DNA or RNA could be an antigen by itself.
      <br/>
      Peroxidase may bind to DNA or RNA on a support, for example, in the form of a DNA or RNA-(hybridized) -digoxigenin labeled DNA probe-peroxidase labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody.
      <br/>
      The symbol "-", as referred to herein, indicates an immune complex-forming bond; and "-(hybridized)-" indicates an intercomplementary hybridization bond between DNA or RNA and a DNA probe.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As mentioned above, the fluorescent dyes formed from the compounds of formula (I) used in the invention, have a high affinity for solid supports themselves, or for nucleic acids carried on solid supports.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when a compound of formula (I) is present, in a reaction system comprising hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase bonded to a solid support, the fluorescent dye is formed in situ from the compound of formula (I) by means of the intended reaction.
      <br/>
      These fluorescent dyes can bind to the support, or to the nucleic acid carried on the support.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the composition of the present invention is advantageously used in in-situ fluorometric immunoassay.
      <br/>
      However, the invention does not exclude the use of the fluorescence-generating substrates of formula (I) in measurement of hydrogen peroxide formed, for example, from clinically important compounds of glucose, urea, amino acids or the like in the presence of glucose oxidase, uric acid oxidase, amino acid oxidase, or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      As mentioned above, the composition of this invention can be used for detecting specific substances in biological specimens.
      <br/>
      The biological specimens include animal fluids, such as blood, urea, etc., as well as animal and vegetable tissue slices.
      <br/>
      Saccharides, lipids, amino acids, nucleic acids, proteins and other substances that may exist in such specimens could be the analytes to be detected in the invention.
      <br/>
      In general, well known immunloassays are appropriate for the detection of those analytes.
      <br/>
      Antibodies labeled with peroxidase are suitable for detecting nucleic acids and proteins (e.g., receptors) in tissue specimens.
      <br/>
      For detecting nucleic acids, samples may be processed in a reaction system comprising peroxidase, that may not be bonded to a solid support, and hydrogen peroxide, along with a compound of formula (I), so that the fluorescent dye formed in situ is bound to the nucleic acid to be detected.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Qualitative or quantitative detection of a fluorescent dye may be attained by applying a specific wavelength of radiation to the dye, followed by measuring the fluorescence energy generated by the dye.
      <br/>
      In quantitative detection, the intensity of the fluorescence energy generated may be related to the amount of the analyte existing in the samples.
      <br/>
      The fluorescence energy may be measured with any suitable, commercially available detectors.

      Each human chromosome sample was immersed in a denaturing solution kept heated at 70 (degree)  C., for 2 minutes, and then rapidly cooled by putting it into 70% ethanol cooled to 4 (degree)  C., whereby the double-stranded DNA of the sample was kept dissociated in a single-stranded condition.

      <br/>
      This probe was mixed with a hybridization solution, put on the human chromosome sample, and reacted with it overnight at 37 (degree)  C. (in-situ hybridization).

      The excess enzyme antibody not bonded to the probe was removed by washing the system with a washing solution containing a surfactant.

      Any of the fluorescence-generating substrates (Compounds 1 to 11) of the invention and a commercially-available, water-soluble fluorescent substrate, HPPA was dissolved in a reactant solution containing 0.01% hydrogen peroxide (1 mM), and the resulting fluorescent substrate solution was put on the sample and reacted with it at room temperature for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      After reacting in the reaction system comprising the probe-bonded peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide, the fluorescence-generating substrate formed a new compound which was fixed on the chromosome and emitted fluorescence, which was observed using a fluorescence microscopic.
