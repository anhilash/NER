      A method for making an oil soluble coking process additive, includes the steps of: providing mixture of a metal salt in water wherein the metal salt contains a metal selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and mixtures thereof; providing a heavy hydrocarbon; forming an emulsion of the mixture and the heavy hydrocarbon; heating the emulsion so as to react the metal salt with components of the heavy hydrocarbon so as to provide a treated hydrocarbon containing oil soluble organometallic compound, wherein the organometallic compound includes the metal and is stable at a temperature of at least about 300° C.
      <br/>
      The oil soluble additive and a process using same are also disclosed.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to coking processes for upgrading atmospheric and vacuum residues and, more particularly, to an oil soluble coking process additive, and method for making and using same, which reduces or minimizes coke formation and enhances desired distillation reactions.</p>
    <p num="3">Coking is an increasingly important process whereby heavy petroleum fractions such as atmospheric residue, vacuum residue, high-boiling virgin or cracked petroleum residue and the like are efficiently converted to more desirable distillate products, along with a by-product of coke.</p>
    <p num="4">

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The invention relates to an oil soluble coking process additive for reducing or minimizing coke formation and enhancing distillate production in coking processes, especially delayed coking processes.
      <br/>
      The invention further relates to a method for making the oil soluble coking process additive, and a coking process utilizing the oil soluble coking process additive of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      According to the invention, an oil soluble additive is introduced into coking feedstocks in the form of an oil soluble organometallic compound which is stable up to certain elevated temperatures and which acts as an anti-flocculent so as to reduce or minimize coke formation during the coking process.
      <br/>
      Further, once decomposition temperature is reached, the compound does decompose, and the resulting metal is a catalyst toward desired distillate forming reactions which is useful, for example in steam conversion.
    </p>
    <p num="17">According to the invention, the oil soluble coking process additive is prepared by forming a mixture of a metal salt in water, and then forming an emulsion of the mixture with a heavy hydrocarbon feedstock to be treated, and subsequently heating the emulsion so as to dehydrate the emulsion and react the metal salt with components within the heavy hydrocarbon so as to provide a treated hydrocarbon containing an oil soluble organometallic compound.</p>
    <p num="18">
      Metal salts preferably include salts of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the metal salt is a salt of potassium, calcium and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Alkaline earth metals are preferred, and the metal is most preferably calcium.
      <br/>
      Suitable salts include hydroxides such as potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, and carbonates such as calcium carbonate and the like.
      <br/>
      The most preferred salt is calcium hydroxide.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Suitable heavy hydrocarbon for use in preparing the additive in accordance with the present invention typically includes any suitable feed for a coking process, and preferably is an atmospheric or vacuum residue.
      <br/>
      As will be set forth in further detail below, the oil soluble additive of the present invention may suitably be introduced directly to the feedstock by treating the feedstock itself, or a portion of the feed can be separated from the main volume of feed and used to prepare the oil soluble additive contained therein, with this portion then being re-introduced into the main volume of the feed.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The mixture of metal salt in water may suitably be provided as a solution or dispersion, depending upon the water solubility of the metal salt.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Metal salt/water mixture or solution and heavy hydrocarbon are preferably mixed to form the emulsion having a ratio by volume of water to oil of between about 4:96 and about 40:80, more preferably, between about 5:95 and about 20:80.
      <br/>
      In addition, metal salt is preferably provided in the water mixture and the water mixture provided in amounts sufficient to provide for a concentration of metal in the final hydrocarbon feedstock of at least about 20 ppm wt. based upon the feed, preferably at least about 50 ppm wt. based upon the feed.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The emulsion is preferably formed in accordance with the present invention by providing the water mixture and hydrocarbon phases at a temperature of between about 50 (degree)  C. and about 300 (degree)  C., more preferably between about 100 (degree)  C. and about 150 (degree)  C., and forming the emulsion at a desired temperature, mixing rate and mixing time to provide a desired emulsion.
      <br/>
      The emulsion is preferably formed using sufficient energy to provide an average droplet size of the emulsion of less than or equal to about 1 micron.
      <br/>
      The emulsion is preferably formed at a temperature of between about 90 (degree)  C. and about 300 (degree)  C., and most preferably at a temperature of about 100 (degree)  C., and may be formed using a mixing rate of between about 600 rpm and about 1200 rpm.
      <br/>
      Of course, other emulsion formation procedures can be used, if desired.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The emulsion is then preferably heated, as discussed above, and it is believed in accordance with the present invention that the heating step induces an interfacial reaction between heavy heteroatomic components or polar molecules of the crude, and salt cations/anions in the water phase so as to form a chemical association between the metal and hydrocarbon as desired.
      <br/>
      The reaction product of this step is an oil soluble compound which serves advantageously as an anti-flocculent as well as a catalyst precursor.
      <br/>
      The reaction product may be, for example, CaNaph2, KNaph, Ca (CH3 (CH2)14 COO)2, K(CH3 (CH2)14 COO) Ca(CH3 (CH2)4 CH.dbd.CH(CH2)7 COO)2, K(CH3 (CH2)4 CH.dbd.CH(CH2)7 COO), and mixtures thereof, wherein Naph is naphthenate.
    </p>
    <p num="24">After the emulsion is formed, it is preferably heated to a temperature sufficient to react the metal salt with certain components of the heavy hydrocarbon so as to dehydrate the emulsion and to provide the desired oil soluble organometallic compound.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Typical heavy hydrocarbon for use in accordance with the present invention includes one or more compounds with which the metal salt can react to form the desired organometallic compound as a reaction product.
      <br/>
      These components of the heavy hydrocarbon include naphthenic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, and other organic acids or compositions which react with the metal salt to provide the desired organometallic compound which is preferably soluble in oil at temperatures above about 250 (degree)  C., preferably above about 200 (degree)  C., and is stable at temperatures of at least about 300 (degree)  C., and more preferably at least about 450 (degree)  C., as desired and as will be further discussed below.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Referring now to FIG. 1, a process in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated.</p>
    <p num="27">
      As shown, a suitable feed is provided, for example in the form of an atmospheric/vacuum residue at a temperature of about 100 (degree)  C. To this residue 10, an aqueous dispersion 12 of metal salt is added, and this combination is passed to static mixer 14 wherein sufficient energy is applied to the mixture for a time sufficient to form a water-in-oil emulsion of the aqueous dispersion in the atmospheric/vacuum residue.
      <br/>
      This emulsion is then passed to a preheater 16 wherein the emulsion is heated to a temperature sufficient to dehydrate the emulsion and react the metal salt from the aqueous dispersion with components or acids from the heavy hydrocarbon as discussed above so as to provide the desired oil soluble organometallic compounds.
      <br/>
      Preheater 16 may suitably be used to heat this emulsion to a temperature of about 200 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      At this point, the oil soluble coking process additive of the present invention is provided in the form of a treated hydrocarbon containing oil soluble organometallic compound in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      It should of course be appreciated that this additive could alternatively be provided by separating off a portion of residue 10 for mixing with aqueous dispersion 12 and subsequent heating, and that this treated hydrocarbon can easily be re-introduced to the original feed to provide reaction feedstock which preferably includes the organometallic compound in amounts sufficient to provide a concentration of metal of at least about 20 ppm, preferably at least about 50 ppm.
    </p>
    <p num="29">As shown in FIG. 1, water 17 may suitably be injected into the reaction feedstock, if desired, preferably in amounts less than or equal to about 30% volume based on the original feedstock.</p>
    <p num="30">
      The reaction feedstock is then fed to a conventional coking process reactor where it is subjected to conventional coking conditions including a temperature which eventually exceeds the temperature at which the organometallic compound decomposes or is no longer stable.
      <br/>
      Typical process conditions include a temperature of about 460 (degree)  C,-540 (degree)  C., a pressure of about 15-30 psi and a residence time of about 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In coking process reactor 18, the process is carried out during a first stage or phase wherein the oil soluble organometallic compound is still below its decomposition temperature, and the compound advantageously serves as an anti-flocculent, thereby reducing or minimizing polymerization reactions which lead to coke formation.
      <br/>
      Eventually, temperature to which the organometallic compound is exposed exceeds the decomposition temperature thereof, and the compound decomposes so as to provide the metal in the form of a catalyst for enhancing distillate formation reactions during a second phase or stage of the process, for example steam conversion.
    </p>
    <p num="32">As a result of the above, an end product 20 of the coking process advantageously contains enhanced distillate fractions and reduced coke fractions as desired in accordance with the present invention.</p>
    <p num="33">The following examples further illustrate the method and additive of present invention.</p>
    <p num="34">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="35">
      In this example, a feedstock was treated in a delayed coking process for four different runs using calcium, potassium, and a calcium/potassium mixture as additive.
      <br/>
      In addition, 1 run was conducted without an additive as a control (run 1).

      In this example, feedstocks were prepared and treated in a delayed coking reaction starting with the same basic feedstock as set forth in Example 1 above.
