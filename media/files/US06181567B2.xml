      A method of securing an electronic package to a circuit board includes the step of providing a retainer having a locating cavity defined therein.
      <br/>
      The method further includes the step of positioning the electronic package within the locating cavity so that the electronic package is fixed in relationship to the retainer.
      <br/>

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to an electronic package, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for securing an electronic package to a circuit board.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Electronic packages typically include a number of integrated circuits which are housed within a plastic or ceramic package.
      <br/>
      Such packages, hereinafter referred to as "electronic packages", are generally rectangular or square in shape and include a plurality of conductive pads on a bottom surface thereof.
      <br/>
      The conductive pads may be arranged in a grid-like pattern to increase number or density of the conductive pads which may be included in the electronic package.
      <br/>
      One such type of grid-like pattern arrangement is referred to as a ball grid array package.
      <br/>
      In a ball grid array package, a finely-pitched matrix of spheroid- or ball-shaped conductive pads extend outwardly from the bottom surface of the electronic package.
    </p>
    <p num="3">A circuit board, such as a printed circuit board or a printed circuit assembly, to which the ball grid array package is to be mounted includes a corresponding number of conductive pads which are arranged in a similar matrix as the matrix of ball-shaped conductive pads included in the ball grid array package.</p>
    <p num="4">
      In order to mount the ball grid array package to the circuit board, a small quantity of a conductive metal alloy such as solder is placed on the conductive pads of the circuit board prior to placing and aligning the conductive pads of the ball grid array package thereon.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the circuit board and the ball grid array package thereon are heated to a temperature which is greater in magnitude than the melting point of the solder thereby fusing the ball-shaped conductive pads of the ball grid array package to the conductive pads of the circuit board.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Although soldering the ball grid array package to the circuit board yields a strong, reliable mechanical and electrical connection, it may be undesirable if it becomes necessary at a later time to remove the ball grid array package from the circuit board.
      <br/>
      In particular, if it becomes necessary to repair or replace the ball grid array package that is soldered to the circuit board, the circuit board must again be heated to a temperature which is greater in magnitude than the melting point of the solder in order to remove the ball grid array package from the circuit board.
      <br/>
      Such re-heating of the circuit board may reduce the useful life of both the circuit board and the various other components secured thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Soldering the electronic package is particularly undesirable during the development stages of a given electronic assembly.
      <br/>
      This is true since the various integrated circuits within the ball grid array package may require several design iterations during the development thereof.
      <br/>
      Hence, upon each occasion that the design of one of the integrated circuits is altered, the ball grid array package must be unsoldered, and a ball grid array package containing a revised version of the integrated circuit is thereafter soldered to the circuit board.
      <br/>
      As described above, such unsoldering and re-soldering may damage and/or destroy the circuit board and the other components secured thereto, thereby disadvantageously lowering yields and raising costs associated with the development of the electronic assembly.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the position of the electronic package on the circuit board and/or the configuration of the electronic package itself may prevent the electronic package from being removed from the circuit board in manner which does not irreparably damage the circuit board and/or the other components secured thereto.
      <br/>
      Hence, upon each occasion that the design of one of the integrated circuits is altered, the entire electronic assembly may have to be discarded thereby disadvantageously raising costs associated with the development of the electronic assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      To this end, a number of electronic package securing mechanisms such as sockets or other similar mechanical clamps have been developed to hold or otherwise secure an electronic package to a circuit board without the use of solder on the conductive pads of the electronic package.
      <br/>
      However, many of the electronic package securing mechanisms which have heretofore been designed are mechanically complex.
      <br/>
      Moreover, many of the electronic package securing mechanisms which have heretofore been designed require precision placement and alignment thereof on the circuit board by the use of expensive automated placement machines such as "pick and place" machines.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      What is needed therefore is a method and apparatus for securing an electronic package to a circuit board which does not require the use of solder.
      <br/>
      In addition, what is needed is a method and apparatus for securing an electronic package to a circuit board which is relatively simple and inexpensive.
      <br/>
      Moreover, what is needed is a method and apparatus for securing an electronic package to a circuit board which does not require the use of automated placement machines.
      <br/>
      What is further needed is a method and apparatus for securing an electronic package to a circuit board which enables fast and simple removal and replacement of the electronic package.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="22">
      While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail.
      <br/>
      It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Referring now to FIGS. 1-7, there is shown an electronic package securing assembly 10.
      <br/>
      The securing assembly 10 includes an retainer 12, a number of electronic packages 14, 15, a circuit board 16, a back plate 18, a number of bolts 20, and a number of nuts 22.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The electronic packages 14, 15 are configured in a ball grid array packaging arrangement as shown in FIGS. 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B.
      <br/>
      In particular, the electronic packages 14, 15 include a number of sphere- or ball-shaped conductive pads 26 extending outwardly from a bottom surface 14e, 15e, respectively, thereof.
      <br/>
      Each of the electronic packages 14,15 further includes a housing 24.
      <br/>
      The housing 24 is made from an insulative material such as plastic or ceramic.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the ball-shaped conductive pads 26 are electrically coupled in a known manner to a number of integrated circuits 28 encapsulated within the housing 24.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The circuit board 16 may be any known printed circuit board, printed circuit assembly, or the like.
      <br/>
      The circuit board 16 may be single-sided, double-sided, or multi-layered in construction.
      <br/>
      The circuit board 16 includes a number of surface mount type conductive pads 30a, 30b as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that the size and position of the conductive pads 30a, 30b correspond with the size and position of the ball-shaped conductive pads 26 of the electronic packages 14,15, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Moreover, the circuit board 16 has a number of board apertures 32a-f defined therein as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that the position of each of the conductive pads 30a, 30b may be measured relative to a center point 33 of the board aperture 32a.
      <br/>
      In particular, the location of a given conductive pad 30a or 30b may be defined as a first predetermined distance in the x-direction, and a second predetermined distance in the y-direction from the center point 33 of the board aperture 32a.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the retainer 12 is rectangular in shape and is an integrally formed single part that may be constructed of either plastic or metal.
      <br/>
      The retainer 12 further has a number of retainer apertures 34a-f defined therein.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, the retainer apertures 34a-f respectively align with (1) the board apertures 32a-f defined in the circuit board 16, and (2) a number of plate apertures 36a-f defined in the back plate 18.
    </p>
    <p num="28">One of the bolts 20 is positioned in each of the board apertures 32a-f, the retainer apertures 34a-f, and the plate apertures 36a-f, and thereafter is threadingly engaged by the nuts 22 in order to secure the retainer 12 to a top surface 16a of the circuit board 16, while also securing the back plate 18 to a bottom surface 16b of the circuit board 16.</p>
    <p num="29">
      As shown in FIGS. 5-6, the retainer 12 has a pair of locating cavities 17,19 defined therein.
      <br/>
      The locating cavities 17,19 define a number of cavity sidewalls 17a-d, and 19a-d, respectively.
      <br/>
      The cavity sidewalls 17a-d, 19a-d are configured to secure and position the electronic packages 14,15, respectively.
      <br/>
      In particular, the size and location of the cavity sidewalls 17a-d, 19a-d are configured to conform closely to a number of outer edges 14a-d, 15a-d, respectively, defined by the electronic packages 14,15, respectively (see FIGS. 2A and 3A).
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that when the electronic packages 14,15 are secured within the locating cavities 17,19, respectively, the outer edges 14a-d, 15a-d contact the sidewalls 17a-d, 19a-d thereby enabling the electronic packages 14,15 to be snap-fit or similarly secured within the locating cavities 17,19, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      From the previous discussion, it should be appreciated that the size and location of the locating cavities 17,19 may be used to align the ball-shaped conductive pads 26 of the electronic packages 14,15, respectively, relative to the conductive pads 30a, 30b, respectively, of the circuit board 16.
      <br/>
      More specifically, once the electronic packages 14,15 are positioned in the locating cavities 17,19, respectively, the position of each of the ball-shaped conductive pads 26 may be measured relative to a center point 38 of the retainer aperture 34a (see FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      In particular, the location of each of the ball-shaped conductive pads 26 of the electronic packages 14, 15 may be defined as a first predetermined distance in the x-direction, and a second predetermined distance in the y-direction from the center point 38 of the retainer aperture 34a.
      <br/>
      Hence, the location of each of the ball-shaped conductive pads 26 of the electronic packages 14, 15 may also be predetermined in order to align with a corresponding conductive pad 30a, 30b, respectively, when the retainer 12 and the electronic packages 14, 15 are secured the circuit board 16.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Each of the locating cavities 17, 19 includes an engagement surface 17e, 19e, respectively, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      When the bolts 20 are tightened, the retainer 12 and hence the engagement surfaces 17e, 19e are urged in the general direction of arrow C of FIG. 1 thereby causing the engagement surfaces 17e, 19e to contact an upper surface 14f, 15f, respectively, of the electronic packages 14, 15.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      An interposer 40 (see FIG. 1) may be used to enhance the mechanical and electrical contact between the electronic packages 14, 15 and the circuit board 16.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the interposer 40 may be sandwiched between the ball-shaped conductive pads 26 of the electronic packages 14, 15 and the conductive pads 30a, 30b, respectively, of the circuit board 16.
      <br/>
      The interposer 40 is a elastomeric cloth material having anisotropic properties, and may be particularly useful for maintaining a reliable mechanical and electrical connection between the ball-shaped conductive pads 26 of the electronic packages 14, 15 and the conductive pads 30a, 30b, respectively, of the circuit board 16 despite any warpage or similar deformities that may be present in either the circuit board 16 or the retainer 12.
      <br/>
      Such an anisotropic material electrically conducts along a single axis, but does not conduct along any other axes.
      <br/>
      For example, the interposer 40 conducts along the axis defined by the general direction of arrow A of FIG. 1, but does conduct along any other axis (e.g. an axis defined by the general direction of arrow B of FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      Such a material is advantageous in that it does not have to be placed or otherwise positioned on the circuit board 16 by a high precision placement machine such as a "pick and place" machine.
      <br/>
      For example, the interposer 40 may be purchased in a roll or in pre-cut strips, and may thereafter be placed or otherwise positioned by hand on the conductive pads 30a, 30b of the circuit board 16 prior to the attachment thereto of the electronic packages 14, 15 and the retainer 12.
      <br/>
      One such material which may be suitable for use as the interposer 40 of the present invention is a part number ZC01507E-100 "Z-Axis Elastomer" which is commercially available from W.L. Gore and Associates, Inc. of Elkton, Md.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In operation, the interposer 40 may first be positioned on the conductive pads 30a, 30b of the circuit board 16.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the electronic packages 14, 15 may be positioned on the interposer 40 in a position in which each of the ball-shaped conductive pads 24 is proximate a corresponding conductive pad 30a, 30b.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the retainer 12 may be lowered onto the electronic packages 14, 15, in order to position and secure the electronic packages 14, 15 within the locating cavities 17, 19, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Once the retainer 12 is positioned on the circuit board 16, the bolts 20 are inserted through the retainer apertures 34a-f and the board apertures 32a-f.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the back plate 18 is positioned on the bottom surface 16b of the circuit board 16 by advancing the bolts 20 through the plate apertures 36a-f.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the nuts 22 are threadingly engaged with the bolts 20.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      It should be appreciated that a downward or retaining force is exerted on the electronic packages 14, 15 when the bolts 20 are tightened.
      <br/>
      The bolts 20 may be further tightened in order to increase the retaining force being exerted on the electronic packages 14, 15, whereas the bolts 20 may be loosened to decrease the retaining force being exerted on the electronic packages 14, 15.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In order to remove the electronic packages 14, 15 from the circuit board 16, the nuts 22 are first removed from the bolts 20.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the bolts 20 are removed thereby allowing the retainer 12 to be lifted away from the circuit board 16.
      <br/>
      Once the retainer 12 is lifted away from the circuit board 16, the electronic packages 14, 15 may then be removed.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the same or different electronic packages 14, 15 may be secured to the circuit board 16 in the manner previously discussed.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Alternatively, the electronic packages 14, 15, respectively, may first be secured within the locating cavities 17, 19 of the retainer 12 prior to securing the retainer 12 to the circuit board 16.
      <br/>
      In particular, the electronic packages 14,15, may be friction-fit or otherwise secured in the locating cavities, 17, 19.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the bolts 20 and the nuts 22 may be used to secure the retainer 12 to the circuit board 16 in the manner previously discussed.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Referring now to FIGS. 8-11, there is shown an electronic package securing assembly 50.
      <br/>
      The same reference numerals are used in FIGS. 8-11 to designate common components which were previously discussed in regard to FIGS. 1-7. Therefore, no further discussion thereof is warranted.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The securing assembly 50 is essentially the same as the securing assembly 10, except that the retainer 12 has been replaced with a number of separate components.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the securing assembly 50 includes a locator 52 and a number of spacers 74, 75.
      <br/>
      As shall be discussed in more detail below, the locator 52 and the spacers 74, 75 collectively function equivalently as the retainer 12 of the securing assembly 10.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The securing assembly 50 further includes a number of bolts 53.
      <br/>
      The bolts 53 are installed from the bottom surface 16b of the circuit board 16 through the board apertures 32a-f of the circuit board 16 (see FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the bolts 53 are received through a number of locator apertures 58a-f defined in the locator 52 (see FIG. 9).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8, a number of standoffs 60 and nuts 62 are secured to a threaded shaft portion 53a of each of the bolts 53 thereby securing the locator 52 to the circuit board 16.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      As shown in FIG. 9, the locator 52 has a number of locating cavities 55, 57 defined therein.
      <br/>
      As with the locating cavities 17, 19 of the retainer 12, the locating cavities 57, 59 define a number of cavity sidewalls 57a-d, and 59a-d, respectively.
      <br/>
      The cavity sidewalls 57a-d, 59a-d are configured to secure and position the electronic packages 14, 15, respectively.
      <br/>
      In particular, the size and location of the cavity sidewalls 57a-d, 59a-d are configured to conform closely to the outer edges 14a-d, 15a-d, respectively, defined in the electronic packages 14, 15, respectively.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that when the electronic packages 14, 15 are secured within the locating cavities 57, 59, respectively, the outer edges 14a-d, 15a-d contact the sidewalls 57a-d, 59a-d thereby enabling the electronic packages 14,15 to be secured within the locating cavities 17,19, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      From the previous discussion, it should be appreciated that the size and location of the locating cavities 57, 59 may be used to align the ball-shaped conductive pads 26 of the electronic packages 14,15, respectively, relative to the conductive pads 30a, 30b, respectively, of the circuit board 16.
      <br/>
      More specifically, once the electronic packages 14,15 are positioned in the locating cavities 57, 59, respectively, the position of each of the ball-shaped conductive pads 26 may be measured relative to a center point 56 of the locator aperture 58a (see FIG. 9).

      The compressing bolts 78 may be further tightened in order to increase the retaining force being exerted on the electronic packages 14, 15, whereas the compressing bolts 78 may be loosened to decrease the retaining force being exerted on the electronic packages 14, 15.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      In order to remove the electronic packages 14, 15 from the circuit board 16, the compressing bolts are first loosened.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the locking nuts 70 are removed from the bolts 53.
      <br/>
      After which, the compressing plate 66 may be lifted away from the bolts 53, and thereafter the spacers 74, 75 may be removed.
      <br/>
      Once the spacers 74, 75 are lifted away, the electronic packages 14, 15 may then be removed.

      Although the bolts 20, 53 and the nuts 22, 62, 70 have been described as a manner in which the retainer may be secured to the circuit board 16 and have significant benefits in their use in the present invention, many of the advantageous of the present invention may be achieved by the use of other types of fasteners.
      <br/>
      For example, the retainer may be secured to the circuit board by using a clamp or other similar fastening device.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      It should be appreciated that the back plate 18 (see FIG. 1) may be integrated into another component associated with an electronic assembly.
      <br/>
      For example, the back plate 18 may be integrated into a chassis associated with the electronic assembly, as opposed to being provided as a separate, discrete component.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In addition, although the securing assembly 10 (see FIG. 1) has been described as including the back plate 18 and has significant benefits in its use in the present invention, many of the advantageous of the present invention may be achieved without the use of the back plate 10.
      <br/>
      In particular, the bolts 20 may be threadingly engaged into the circuit board 16 thereby eliminating the need for the back plate 18.
