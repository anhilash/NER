      No. 09/233,887, for Improved Process For Buried Strap Self-Aligned To Deep Storage Trench, filed Jan. 20, 1999, the entire contents of the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The invention relates to semiconductor devices.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention relates to dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Increasing numbers of semiconductor devices, such as individual memory cells, are being created on a single chip.
      <br/>
      As a result, dimensions of the devices continue to shrink.
      <br/>
      Shrinking device dimensions can increase the difficulty of ensuring proper alignment over an adequate functional area of the structures included in the semiconductor devices.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      For example, a merged isolation node trench (MINT) cell is illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The MINT cell illustrated in FIG. 1 includes a planar transfer device.
      <br/>
      The device shown in FIG. 1 includes a deep trench capacitor 1 a shallow trench isolation region 2 used to define the active area, a bit line contact (CB) 3, a word line (WL) 5, or transfer device gate, gate oxide 7 and N+ source/drain regions 9 and 11.
      <br/>
      In the structure illustrated in FIG. 1, a buried strap 12 connects the deep trench capacitor storage trench node 1 to the source/drain diffusion 11 of the transfer device.
      <br/>
      In a MINT cell, MINT buried strap resistance may be a function of the overlap of the deep trench 1 and the shallow trench isolation region 2 of the memory cell.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">The invention addresses MINT buried strap resistance as a function of overlay between the deep trench and active area overlay making the shallow trench isolation pattern self-aligned to the deep trench to ensure full trench width for buried strap formation.</p>
    <p num="6">
      In accordance with these and other objects and advantages, the present invention provides a semiconductor device including a substrate.
      <br/>
      At least one pair of deep trenches is arranged in the substrate.
      <br/>
      A collar lines at least a portion of a wall of each deep trench.
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      As semiconductor device dimensions decrease and an increasing number of devices are packed into one space, problems may arise as a result of device crowding and aligning devices and portions of devices with ever decreasing dimensions.
      <br/>
      For example, in some memory cells, the deep trench and active area pattern may be misaligned.
      <br/>
      One problem resulting from this is that buried strap resistance is a function of deep trench-active area overlay.
      <br/>
      Therefore, misalignment of the deep trench-active area overlay may alter buried strap resistance, and cause an increase in the variation of the series resistance of the buried strap due to the manufacturing tolerance of the misalignment.
    </p>
    <p num="12">

      <br/>
      FIG. 2 also illustrates two examples of deep trench-active area overlay.
      <br/>
      Deep trench-active area overlay area 22 illustrates a more favorable amount of overlay between the active area and the deep trench.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, deep trench-active area region 24 is less desirable.

    <p num="13">
      FIG. 3 illustrates a cross-sectional view of an example of less favorable deep trench-active area overlay 32.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 illustrates filled deep trenches 26 each having an associated collar region 28.
      <br/>
      Shallow trench isolation region 30 overlies deep trenches 26 as well as a region between the deep trenches.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention provides a solution for ensuring favorable deep trench-active area overlay by providing a process for making the active area pattern self-aligned to the deep trench to ensure the full trench width for buried strap formation.
      <br/>
      Processes according to the present invention would be utilized to form a MINT-based deep trench capacitor and shallow trench isolation region using a trench top oxide region as a masking layer for the shallow trench isolation region.
      <br/>
      Processes according to the present invention may also be utilized for forming other semiconductor devices.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      According to the structure of the present invention illustrated in FIGS. 4-15, a substrate 34 may be provided.
      <br/>
      A dielectric layer 36 may be provided on the top surface of the substrate.
      <br/>
      According to one example, the dielectric layer is a nitride.
      <br/>
      In particular, nitride that may be utilized as the dielectric layer 36 is silicon nitride SiN.
      <br/>
      Although not shown in the figures, additional thin dielectric layers, such as silicon dioxide, may be included in the dielectric layer 36.
      <br/>
      After providing a substrate 34 with dielectric layer 36 arranged on the top surface thereof, deep trenches 38 may be formed through dielectric layer 36 into substrate 34 using standard lithographic and dry etch techniques, such as reactive ion etching (RIE).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      After formation of deep trenches 38, a collar 40 may be formed on a portion of the surface 42 of each deep trench 38.
      <br/>
      The collar may be formed of a dielectric material, such as silicon dioxide.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The collar may be formed by oxidation of the trench wall.
      <br/>
      Typically, the collar is formed in an upper region of each deep trench 38 such that the collar, when formed, extends all of the way to the top of the deep trenches 38.
      <br/>
      In other words, the substrate material forming the walls 42 of deep trenches 38 may be oxidized to form the collar 40.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      After formation of the collar regions 40, the deep trenches are filled with a conductive material.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 illustrates an example of filled deep trenches.
      <br/>
      The deep trenches may first be filled with a desired material.
      <br/>
      Examples of materials that may be utilized to fill the deep trenches include various semiconductor materials.
      <br/>
      For example, polycrystalline silicon may be utilized as a deep trench fill.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      After filling the deep trenches, the upper surface of the structure illustrated in FIG. 6 may be planarized to remove any deep trench fill that may have been deposited the upper surface of the structure.
      <br/>
      The deep trench fill may then be recessed below the opening of the deep trench at the upper level of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The recessing may be carried out utilizing a dry etch technique, such as RIE.
      <br/>
      In other words, the deep trench fill may be recessed below the interface of substrate 34 and dielectric layer 36.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 illustrates recessed deep trench fill 44.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      After filling the deep trenches and recessing the trench fill to a desired level, the collars 40 may be isotropically etched away from the exposed sidewalls of the trenches such that the top surface of the collars is below the top surface of the trench fill.
      <br/>
      Etching of the collars 40 may be carried out with a wet etch process.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 illustrates recessed collar structures 40.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      After recessing the collar structures 40, a buried strap may be formed in each deep trench.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, the deep strap may be formed so as to extend entirely across the deep trenches.
      <br/>
      The buried straps may be formed of a semiconductor material.
      <br/>
      According to one embodiment, the buried straps may be formed of silicon.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Any suitable technique may be utilized for forming the buried strap.
      <br/>
      For example, chemical vapor deposition may be utilized.
      <br/>
      According to one embodiment, low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LP CVD) may be utilized to form the buried strap.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The buried strap may be formed so as to cover the trench fill 44 as well as the collar structures 40.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the invention, after depositing the buried strap material, the material may be recessed.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 illustrates an example of buried straps 46 formed over the trench fill 44 and recessed collar 40 after the strap silicon has been isotropically removed from the wafer surface and trench sidewalls.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      After formation of the buried strap structures 46, a liner 48 may be formed over dielectric layer 36, surfaces of the dielectric layer 36 lining the opening above the deep trenches, the walls of the deep trenches above the strap 46, and the surface of the straps although this is not shown in the Figures.
      <br/>
      It is not necessary that the present invention include a liner.
      <br/>
      Rather, the liner is an optional structure.
      <br/>
      The liner may be formed of a dielectric material.
      <br/>
      According to one example, the liner is formed of an LPCVD nitride having a thickness of about 2 nm to about 10 nm.
      <br/>
      One particular nitride that may be utilized in the liner is silicon nitride SiN.
      <br/>
      In addition, it may be desired to form a thin thermal oxidation of about 2 nm to about 10 nm prior to deposition of the liner.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      After formation of the liner structure 48, a dielectric material 50 may be deposited over the liner.
      <br/>
      If the present invention does not include a liner, then the dielectric layer would be deposited over the same structures described above that the liner would be deposited on.
      <br/>
      Any suitable dielectric may be utilized.
      <br/>
      According to one example, an oxide may be utilized to form dielectric layer 50.
      <br/>
      One example of an oxide that may be utilized is silicon dioxide.
    </p>
    <p num="26">FIG. 9 illustrates a structure including the liner 48 and dielectric region 50.</p>
    <p num="27">
      After deposition of dielectric layer 50, portions of dielectric 50 lying above dielectric region 36 may be removed by planarizing, such as by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), the dielectric region 50.
      <br/>
      During this planarization step, regions of the liner lying on top of the dielectric region 36 may also be removed, if the structure includes a liner.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 illustrates the structure resulting from planarization of the dielectric region 50.
      <br/>
      As can be seen in FIG. 10, the remaining portions of dielectric region 50 lie within the deep trench and within the opening in the dielectric region 36 lying above the deep trenches.
      <br/>
      These dielectric regions 52 may form a trench top region at the top of each deep trench.
      <br/>
      In the event that dielectric material 50 was an oxide, regions 52 may be referred to as a trench top oxide (TTO).
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      After removing portions of the dielectric region 50 to create trench top regions 52, photoresist 54 may be deposited over the entire upper surface of the structure.
      <br/>
      After depositing the photoresist, the photoresist may be patterned to form an active area and shallow trench isolation pattern on the structure.
      <br/>
      FIG. 11 illustrates an example of pattern photoresist 54 on a structure.
      <br/>
      The photoresist illustrated in FIG. 11 has been patterned to expose a portion of each trench top region 52 as well as a region of dielectric 36 between the deep trenches.
      <br/>
      Traditional photolithography processes may be utilized to pattern the photoresist to form the mask.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      After formation of desired mask pattern 54 over the deep trench and other underlying structures, the regions of the structure exposed by removal of portions of the photoresist may be etched.
      <br/>
      Typically, a reactive ion etch is utilized.
      <br/>
      The etch may includes fluorine, carbon and oxygen feed gas.
      <br/>
      Examples of such gasses can include CF4, CHF3, Ar, O2, CO, C2 F6, C4 F6, and/or C3 F8.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The etch process may be carried out in a plurality of steps.
      <br/>
      For example, a first etch may be utilized to etch only the portions of dielectric region 36 but not portions of dielectric 52.
      <br/>
      Such an etch may be considered to etch the dielectric 36 selective to dielectric 52.
      <br/>
      At least a portion of the substrate underlying regions of dielectric layer 36 may be removed by the etch.
      <br/>
      This etch may also be considered to be selective to the photoresist.
      <br/>
      FIG. 12 illustrates a region 56 adjacent the deep trenches created by the etch.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The resulting structures may now be considered to represent to portions of a semiconductor device divided by line 58.
      <br/>
      These portions are the array 60 and the supporting structure 62.
      <br/>
      The region 56 created by the etch represents a part of the supporting structures.
      <br/>
      The support structures may include conventional transistors and shallow trench isolation regions.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      A second etch may now carried out to etch the silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      This second etch will be selective to the exposed portions of the trench top structures 52.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 13, the substrate may be etched down to a level that lies below the strap structure 46 and below the top of the collar regions 40.
      <br/>
      The region between the deep trenches as well as the support structure opening 56 may be etched to the same level.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, these two regions may be etched to differential levels.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 13, during the etching of the substrate, at least a portion of the trench top regions 52 may also be etched.
      <br/>
      This second etch may be considered to be an etch of the silicon selective to the dielectric 52 as well as photoresist 54 and can be dry etch using feed gases, such as Cl2, HCl, HBr, and/or BCl.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      After etching of the dielectric region 36, substrate, and trench top regions 52, remaining photoresist 54 may be removed from the upper surface of the structure.
      <br/>
      Also after etching the dielectric 36, substrate and trench top regions, material may be deposited in region 64.
      <br/>
      Region 64 may form an isolation region, typically a shallow isolation region, between the deep trenches.
      <br/>
      Material filling isolation region 64 may also be utilized to fill support structure trench 56.
      <br/>
      The regions 56 and 64 may be filled simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The material deposited in region 64 may be a dielectric material.
      <br/>
      According to one example, the dielectric material deposited in region 64 is an oxide, such as silicon oxide.
      <br/>
      The dielectric material forms a shallow trench isolation region.
      <br/>
      After depositing the dielectric to form region 64, the upper surface of the structure may be planarized to remove regions of dielectric material lying outside of the space forming the isolation region.
      <br/>
      The planarization may be carried out using CMP.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      After filling isolation region 64, dielectric region 36 may be removed from the upper surface of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Planarization of dielectric material filling the isolation region 64 may also remove portions of the trench too regions 52 as well as dielectric region 36.
      <br/>
      This planarization step may be useful to result in co-planar top surfaces of the trench top regions 52 and isolation regions 64.
      <br/>
      The planarization step may also help to make the top of the support structure 56 co-planar with the trench top regions 52 and isolation region 64.

      FIG. 14 illustrates an embodiment of the device structure at this stage in the process.

      <br/>
      The device structures formed over the structure illustrated in FIG. 15 may include gate conductor regions.
      <br/>
      Middle of line regions including contacts to diffusion regions and to the gate conductor and the first level of interconnect wiring, typically known as metal 0 (M0) may also be formed over the deep trenches and/or supporting structure using standard processing techniques.

      Among the advantages of the present invention are that it is not necessary to rely on critical alignment of the AA pattern level to the deep trench pattern level.
      <br/>
      As long as part of the AA pattern overlaps the deep trench, this may provide a strap.
      <br/>
      Additionally, according to the present invention, the deep trench may be made smaller in diameter because the critical overlap tolerance between the AA level and deep trench level is increased.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      According to the present invention, a greater amount of misalignment can be tolerated than according to prior methods and structures because the active area photoresist pattern need only cover the edge of the trench top structure over the deep trench in order to ensure that there is a good conduction path from the active area through the strap and into the deep trench storage capacitor.
