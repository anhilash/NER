      A twin bit DRAM cell capable of storing two bits of digital data as stored charge within the DRAM cell is disclosed.
      <br/>
      The twin bit DRAM cell has two pass transistors, a trench capacitor, and a stack capacitor.
      <br/>
      The pass transistors each have a source connected to a bit line voltage generator to control placement of the charge within the twin bit DRAM cell, a gate connected to a word line voltage generator to control activation of the DRAM cells, and a drain.
      <br/>
      The trench capacitor has a top plate connected to the drain of the first pass transistor and a bottom plate connected to a first biasing voltage source.
      <br/>
      The stack capacitor has a first plate connected to the drain of the second pass transistor and a second plate connected to a second biasing voltage generator.
      <br/>
      Twin bit DRAM cells will be arranged in a plurality of rows and columns to form an array of twin bit DRAM cells.

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to the dynamic random access memories (DRAM) and more particularly to the structures and methods of fabrication of DRAM's storing multiple data bits per DRAM cell.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      The fabrication and structure of DRAM cells and DRAM arrays are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Typical cell structures for high density DRAM in prior art is composed of one transistor M1 70 for switching charges and one storage capacitor C 65 for storing charges is illustrated in FIGS. 1a and 1c. The transistor M1 70 will be an n-MOS transistor fabricated as shown in FIGS. 1b and 1c. A deep N-well 10 will be formed in a p-type substrate 5.
      <br/>
      The area for DRAM cells will be formed as openings during the formation of insulation.
      <br/>
      The insulation is formed by the local oxidation of the silicon substrate (LOCOS) 20. Within the deep n-well 10 a shallower p-well 15 will be formed.
      <br/>
      The gate 40 of the n-MOS transistor M1 70 will be formed as a conductive material such as polysilicon placed over an insulating gate oxide 35 to define the channel area that will be between the drain 30 and source 25 of the n-MOS transistor M1 70.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The drain 30 and the source 25 will be formed by masking the semiconductor substrate 5 and implanting an N+ material to form the N+ drain 30 and the N+ source 25.
      <br/>
      The gate 40 of the MOS transistor M1 70 will be connected to the word line control circuitry (not shown).

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="27">
      Refer now to FIGS. 2a and 2b to understand the structure of the twin bit DRAM cell of this invention.
      <br/>
      The n-MOS transistor M1a 200 acts as a pass transistor to control the transfer the digital data in the form of an electrical Charge from the bit line BLa 220 to the top plate of the trench capacitor CT 210.
      <br/>
      The bulk of the transistor M1A 200 and the bottom plate of the trench capacitor 210 will be connected to a first biasing voltage source Vb1 240.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The n-MOS transistor M1b 205 will act as a pass transistor to control the transfer of digital data in the form of electrical charge to the first plate of the stack capacitor Cs 215.
      <br/>
      The second plate of the stack capacitor Cs 215 will be connected to the second biasing voltage source Vb2 245.
      <br/>
      The bulk of the n-MOS transistor M1b 205 will be connected to the first biasing voltage source Vb1 240.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The gates of the n-MOS transistors M1a 200 and M1b 205 will be connected the word line 250.
      <br/>
      To activate the pass transistors M1a 200 and M1b 205, the word line voltage generator Vword 255 will be set to a boosted voltage level Vh, that exceeds the level of the power supply voltage source (Vcc) by at least the threshold voltage level (VT) of the pass transistors M1a 200 and M1b 205.
    </p>
    <p num="30">To write digital data to the trench capacitor Ct 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215, the bit line voltage generators VBITA 230 and VBITB 235 will be respectively placed at a voltage level approaching the ground reference voltage potential (0V) to represent a first logic level (0), or a voltage level approaching the power supply voltage source (Vcc) to represent a second logic level (1).</p>
    <p num="31">
      The trench capacitor Ct 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215 may not have exactly the same in magnitude of capacitance due to process variations, such as dielectric thickness, trench opening or depth.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the bit line voltage generators VBITA 230 and VBITB 235 are placed at equal voltage levels (either the first logic level (0) or the second logic level (1)) during write operation, the amount of charge stored in either trench capacitor Ct 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215 is not the same.
      <br/>
      This inequality of the stored signal charge causes problems of with the speed of the detecting or sensing the charge.
      <br/>
      The capacitor (trench capacitor Ct 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215) with the lessor charge, will have its charge sensed slower.
      <br/>
      With first biasing voltage source Vb1 240 and the second biasing voltage source Vb2 245 separately biased on capacitor plates, the charge storage in each cell can be force to the same level.
      <br/>
      That is by setting the charge of the second logic level (1) in the stack capacitor Cs 215 to the value of (Vcc -Vb2) * Cs equal to the charge for the second logic level (1) in trench capacitor Ct 210.
      <br/>
      The level of the charge of the trench capacitor Ct 210 will be (Vcc -Vb1)CT.
      <br/>
      The relationship of the voltage levels of the first biasing voltage source Vb1 240 and the second biasing voltage source Vb2 245 will be:
      <br/>
      Vb2 =Vb1 (CT /CS)+Vcc (I-CT /Cs).
    </p>
    <p num="32">It will be obvious that if capacitance of the trench capacitor Ct 210 is equal to the capacitance of the stack capacitor Cs 215, then the first biasing voltage source Vb1 240 and the second biasing voltage source Vb2 245 will be equal.</p>
    <p num="33">
      In order to adjust the charge level for the second logic level (1) of the second logic level (1)) during write operation, the amount of charge stored in either trench capacitor Ct 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215.
      <br/>
      The level of the first biasing voltage source Vb1 240 and the second biasing voltage source Vb2 245 will be set to 0V.
      <br/>
      The time for sensing or detecting the charge stored in the trench capacitor Ct 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215 will be experimentally determined.
      <br/>
      If the times are significantly are systematically different, (e.g. trench capacitor Ct 210 is always larger than the stack capacitor Cs 215), then the charge stored on the stack capacitor Cs 215 will be systematically detected slower than that of the charge stored on the trench capacitor Ct 210.
      <br/>
      By gradually reducing the second biasing voltage source Vb2 245 (toward negative) until the charge stored on the stack capacitor Cs 215 is sensed as fast as the charge stored on the trench capacitor Ct 210.
      <br/>
      The second biasing voltage source Vb2 245 can be thus experimentally adjusted.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      To read the digital data from the trench capacitor CT 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215, the bit line voltage generators VBITA 230 and VBITB 235 will precharge the bit lines BLa 220 and BLb 225 to a voltage level that is one half the level of the power supply voltage source (Vcc /2).
      <br/>
      Sense amplifiers (not shown) connected to each of the bit lines BLa 220 and BLb 225 will sense the presence or absence of charge respectively on the trench capacitor CT 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215 and interpret the contents of the twin bit DRAM cell as two bits of digital data (either the first logic level (0) or the second logic level (1)).
      <br/>
      That is the combinations of the digital data bits will be either both bits will be the first logic level (0), both bits will be the second logic level (1), the first bit will be the first logic level (0) and the second bit will be the second logic level (1), or the first bit will be the second logic level (1) and the second bit will be the first logic level (0) for the four possible combinations of charge in the trench capacitor CT 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The popular "latch-type" sense amplifier commonly used in DRAM is not suitable in an array of twin bit DRAM cells of this invention.
      <br/>
      The well-known differential sense amplifier, however, is very suitable and preferred in an array of twin bit DRAM cells of this invention.
      <br/>
      A typical differential sense amplifier has output that will be at the second logic level (1) if the input voltage Vin is greater than the voltage level of a reference voltage source Vref, and will be at the first logic level (0) if the input voltage Vin is less than the voltage level of the reference voltage source Vref.
      <br/>
      If a latch-type sense amplifier were to be used in an array of twin bit DRAM cells of this invention, the time required for the detection of the charge present on the in the trench capacitor Ct 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215 would be very slow; the power would be large; and the sensitivity would be degraded significantly.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Each differential sense amplifier is connected to a bit-line Bl1a 220 and Bl1b 225 and a reference voltage source Vref, which is biased to one half the power supply voltage source Vcc /2 at all times.
      <br/>
      After the word line voltage generator Vword 255 is biased to the voltage level Vh (&gt;Vcc +VT) and the pass transistors M1a 200 and M1b 205 have been activated, the potential of signals appears on bit-lines Bl1a 220 and Bl1b 225 and are amplified to either the second logic level (1) or the second logic level (0).
      <br/>
      Thus, the four levels of twin-bit data is represented by the voltage levels present at the output of the differential sense amplifiers.
      <br/>
      A more complete description of the operation of an array of twin bit DRAM cells of this invention is explained, hereinafter, in FIG. 4.

      The trench capacitor CT 210 is shown diagrammatically as the top plate being a polysilicon plug poly1260 in a trench that forms the bottom plate.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a polysilicon layer poly2265 will form the first plate of the stack capacitor Cs 215.
      <br/>
      The structure also demonstrates that the trench capacitor CT 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215 will be vertically aligned with one another.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Referring now to FIG. 3.

      The trench capacitor CT 210 is formed by deep etching a trench 302 into a surface of the p-type semiconductor substrate 300.
      <br/>
      A capacitor dielectric ONO1305 is deposited on the surface of the trench 302.
      <br/>
      The capacitor dielectric ONO1305 will be formed of insulating materials such as silicon nitride, silicon dioxide, or oxidized silicon nitride (ONO).
      <br/>
      The trench will be then filled with a polysilicon plug poly1260 to form the top plate of the trench capacitor CT 210.

      The bottom plate of the trench capacitor CT 210 is the p-type substrate 300.

      On the surface of the gate oxide 330 and 335, a polysilicon layer is deposited and etched to form the gates 332 and 337 of the pass transistors M1a 200 and M1b 205.
      <br/>
      The surface of the p-type semiconductor substrate 300 will be masked and implanted with an n-type impurity to form the lightly doped drains NLDD 315 and 325.
      <br/>
      Insulating material will be deposited on the surface of the semiconductor substrate 300 adjacent to the gates 332 and 337 to form spacers for the lightly doped drains.
      <br/>
      The surface of the semiconductor substrate 300, again, will be masked and implanted with an n-type impurity to form the N+ sources 310 and 320.

      Above the top plate of the trench capacitor CT 210, a capacitor insulating material 350 is deposited to electrically insulate the trench capacitor CT 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The capacitor insulating material 350 has to be sufficiently thick to prevent interaction from between the trench capacitor CT 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the capacitor insulating material 350 typically will be approximately 2000  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The trench capacitor CT 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215 will have capacitance values on the order of 50 fF.
      <br/>
      The stray capacitance between the trench capacitor CT 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215 will be much larger than the stray capacitance between the first layer of polysilicon poly1260 and second layer of polysilicon poly2265 with an insulating layer as described above for the capacitor insulating material 350.
      <br/>
      Thus the stray capacitance between the trench capacitor CT 210 and the stack capacitor Cs 215 will have no adverse effect.
