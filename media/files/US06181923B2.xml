      The present invention relates to the automatic frequency control circuit and the method of automatic frequency control.
      <br/>
      The automatic frequency control circuit for processing frequency control of a received signal frequency based on an incoming received signal comprises a first control circuit for processing frequency control based on a precision counter by using the incoming received signal and a second control circuit for processing frequency control based on a coarse counter by using the incoming received signal, wherein the first control circuit and the second control circuit are configured to be used interchangeably in response to the incoming received signal.
      <br/>
      By employing the circuit which directly counts the received signal and the circuit which counts the regenerative carrier signal in combination, the follow up range of the automatic frequency control circuit is thus expanded.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to, for example, automatic frequency control circuit and method of automatic frequency control preferable for use with portable telephone terminal.</p>
    <p num="3">(2) Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Generally, automatic frequency control circuit (AFC circuit) is a circuit which controls reference frequency in the synthesizer (received local generation unit) of terminal station (portable station) according to the quantity of a drift, after counting stable terminating frequency from the base station, when a drift with predetermined theoretical value exists.
      <br/>
      Also, terminating frequency is configured to be counted at the point of received intermediate frequency signal (hereinafter called as received IF signal).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Because the status of radio wave at the portable station (portable telephone terminal) is always changing by receiving fading phenomena, and etc., to average these effects, sufficient counting time is necessary for precise measurement.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the equipment, like a digital portable telephone, which operates with TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) system during receiving period, can only measure frequency of receiving slot of itself during TDMA operation (that is, during conversation), thus, longer counting time is also necessary for sufficient counting process.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a longer time (T/S) * F becomes necessary, where T is a time, F is a time of one frame, and S is a time of the receiving slot of itself.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Because of this, in portable station, there are many cases counting not received IF signal itself, but reference carrier of detected signal which is regenerated in the demodulator circuit (DEM circuit) in receiving unit of portable station.
      <br/>
      That is to say, because influence of fading is suppressed, regenerative carrier signal can be counted more precisely within short period of time than counting received IF signal directly.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      However, as stated above, in case of automatic frequency control circuit counting reference carrier of detected signal regenerated in demodulator circuit, the limit of frequency follow up of the demodulator circuit becomes the limit of frequency follow up of the automatic frequency control circuit itself.
      <br/>
      That is to say, the demodulator circuit, in most cases, is simplified as not to be equipped with unnecessary circuit other than enough circuit for detection, in order to reduce the scale of the circuitry, and to easily integrate in large scale.
      <br/>
      Therefore, frequency limit of follow up as stated above has been produced.
      <br/>
      In certain instances, there may be some cases when the frequency limit of follow up will theoretically be produced by the detection system.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Specifically, as shown in FIG. 9, the carrier regeneration circuit which is configured with the digital circuit of demodulator circuit has the limit of follow up range �"-FL.about.+FL" (2.vertline.FL.vertline.) cf. A in FIG. 9� against input frequency (received IF frequency).
      <br/>
      With the input frequency which is out of this limit of follow up range, output frequency (regenerative carrier frequency) repeats identical value.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the area out of the limit of follow up range, ratio of value between output frequency and input frequency does not coincide with.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when a synthesizer using highly stable local oscillator is equipped in portable station, this synthesizer becomes expensive, and the total cost of whole portable station will be boosted in turn.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="30">(a) Detailed description of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention</p>
    <p num="31">Referring now to the drawings, one preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing configuration of the portable telephone terminal including automatic frequency control circuit (AFC circuit) according to the first preferred embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      Portable telephone terminal 60 shown in this FIG. 1, includes a receiving unit 1, a received signal processing unit 2, a synthesizer unit 3 and a transmitting unit 4.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      As described below, the receiving unit 1 receives output from base station via wireless line 5, and includes, for example, as shown in FIG. 1, a first bandpass filter 10, a low noise amplifier unit 11, a second bandpass filter 12, a receiving mixer 13, a third bandpass filter 14, an amplifier unit 15 and a demodulator circuit 16.
      <br/>
      Incoming signal is filtered by the first bandpass filter (BPF) 10. The low noise amplifier unit (LNA) 11 receives and amplifies the output from the first bandpass filter 10.
      <br/>
      The output from the low noise amplifier unit 11 is filtered by the second bandpass filter (BPF) 12.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Further, the frequency of the received signal which is filtered by the second bandpass filter 12, is converted by the receiving mixer 13, based on output from the synthesizer unit 3 mentioned later.
      <br/>
      Specifically, as hereinafter described, radio frequency (hereinafter called as RF) signal is frequency converted (down conversion) to intermediate frequency (hereinafter called as IF) signal by using LO signal from the synthesizer unit 3 (received local signal: local oscillator output).
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Furthermore, the output from the receiving mixer 13 is filtered by the third bandpass filter (BPF) 14. The amplifier unit (limiter AMP) 15 amplifies the output from the third bandpass filter 14 and outputs it as phase information.
      <br/>
      In automatic frequency control circuit 20 which is mentioned later, the received IF signal frequency can be measured, based on this phase information, by counting number of times of the leading edges of the signal for predetermined gate period.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Furthermore, the demodulator circuit (DEM) 16, which demodulates the output of the amplifier unit 15, includes a carrier regeneration circuit 160, as shown in the FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      This carrier regeneration circuit 160 reproduces carrier itself to specify phase position of the career information in detection.
      <br/>
      Next, the received signal processing unit 2 receives output from the receiving unit 1, processes the output as required for transmission to the transmitting unit 4 mentioned later.
      <br/>
      The received signal processing unit 2 includes the automatic frequency control circuit (AFC circuit) 20, a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) control circuit 21, a codec circuit 22, an analog front end circuit 23 and a mobile station control unit 24.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Hereupon, the automatic frequency control circuit 20 processes frequency control processing of the received signal frequency, based on the incoming received signal, and is controlled starting or completion of its operation by a mobile station control unit 24 mentioned later.
      <br/>
      Further, this automatic frequency control circuit 20 will be described later with reference to FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Further, a TDMA control circuit 21 picks up digital signal from the demodulator circuit 16 by bit unit at regular intervals, and establishes bit synchronization.
      <br/>
      Thus, this signal which is picked up from the TDMA circuit 21 is decoded in the mobile station control unit 24 mentioned later.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Furthermore, the codec circuit 22 converts the digital signal, synchronization of which has been established, into analog signal, in the TDMA circuit 21, and also converts analog signal from the analog front end circuit 23 which will be mentioned later into digital signal.
      <br/>
      The analog front end circuit 23 outputs analog signal from the codec circuit 22 as a voice signal in reception of signal, and in transmission of signal, outputs the input voice signal into the codec circuit 22 as analog signal.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Further, the mobile station control unit 24 decodes the received signal from the base station, and processes required operation to each of the above mentioned circuit.
      <br/>
      For example, it is consisted of a central processing unit (CPU) and a firm ware (micro program).
      <br/>
      Specifically, this mobile station control unit 24, as described above, besides transmits a control signal for starting or completion of the automatic frequency control circuit 20, decodes the signal which is picked up in TDMA circuit 21 at regular intervals.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, this mobile station control unit 24 controls frequency used in the synthesizer unit 3 mentioned later.
      <br/>
      In addition to above, although in this preferred embodiment, the required control 6 in each circuit as described above is performed in the mobile station control unit 24, it may be performed in each circuit respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Next, the synthesizer unit 3 shown in FIG. 1, outputs the received local signal (LO signal) for varying frequency of the input signal, and includes a synthesizer circuit 30 and a local oscillator 31.
      <br/>
      Hereupon, the local oscillator (reference local oscillator) 31 outputs the most stable reference carrier, based on the oscillation frequency control signal from the automatic frequency control circuit 20.
      <br/>
      The synthesizer circuit 30 outputs the received local signal and transmitted local signal to above mentioned receiving mixer 13 and transmitting unit 4 which will be mentioned later, based on the output (reference value) from the local oscillator 31 and the output (frequency control signal) from the mobile station control unit 24.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In other words, output corresponding to the predetermined frequency in the base station is outputted from the mobile station control unit 24.
      <br/>
      This predetermined frequency is compared with the reference value from the local oscillator 31, then the synthesizer circuit 30 outputs a signal corresponding to the comparing result.
      <br/>
      Further, above mentioned synthesizer circuit 30, as shown specifically in FIG. 2, includes a first voltage controlled oscillator 301, a first PLL circuit 302, a second voltage controlled oscillator 303, a second PLL circuit 304 and a multiplier 305.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Hereupon, the first voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) 301 outputs oscillation frequency (f).
      <br/>
      The first phase locked loop circuit (PLL circuit) 302 receives a signal from the local oscillator 31, then counts oscillation frequency from the first voltage controlled oscillator 301.
      <br/>
      As described above, the first PLL circuit outputs the voltage to the first voltage controlled oscillator 301 to control the oscillation frequency, based on the output from the mobile station control unit 24 shown in FIG. 2 (frequency setting signal).
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Thus, the first voltage controlled oscillator 301 outputs the frequency (locked value) generated by the first voltage controlled oscillator 301 per se and the first PLL circuit 302 to the receiving mixer 13.
      <br/>
      Frequency channel of the input signal is controlled by this output (R * LO; received local signal).
      <br/>
      Further, this output from the first voltage controlled oscillator 301 is transmitted to the multiplier 305 which will be mentioned later.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Further, the second voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) 303 outputs oscillation frequency, same as above stated first voltage controlled oscillator 301.
      <br/>
      The second phase locked loop circuit (PLL circuit) 304 receives a signal from the local oscillator 31, then counts oscillation frequency from the second voltage controlled oscillator 303.
      <br/>
      The frequency which is generated by this second phase locked loop circuit 304 and the second voltage controlled oscillator 303 is a fixed value (for example 130 MHz).
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Furthermore, the multiplier 305 multiplies the output from the first voltage controlled oscillator 301 and the output from the second voltage controlled oscillator 303.
      <br/>
      The output from this multiplier 305 (T * LO; transmitted local signal) is outputted to the transmitting unit 4 (the radio frequency modulator 42) which will be mentioned later, establishing frequency channel of the transmission signal.
      <br/>
      In other words, frequency of the received local signal and the frequency of the transmitted local signal are always established by fixed spacing, by this multiplier 305.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Further, the transmitting unit 4 shown in FIG. 1, transmits the signal which was processed in the portable telephone terminal 60, to the base station via wireless line 5, and includes, for example, as shown in FIG. 1, a fourth bandpass filter 40, a power amplifier circuit 41, a radio frequency modulator 42 and a baseband modulator 43.
      <br/>
      Here, the baseband modulator 43 generates modulated base band signal (BB signal).
      <br/>
      The radio frequency modulator 42 frequency converts modulated baseband from the baseband modulator 43 into RF signal, modulation (up conversion) is based on the transmitted local signal from the synthesizer circuit 30.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Further, the power amplifier circuit 41 amplifies the output from the radio frequency modulator 42.
      <br/>
      The fourth bandpass filter (BPF) 40 filters the output from the power amplifier circuit 41.
      <br/>
      The output is transmitted to the base station via wireless line 5.
      <br/>
      Next, FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing a configuration of the automatic frequency control circuit according to the first preferred embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in this FIG. 3, the automatic frequency control circuit 20 includes a first counter 201, a first comparator 202, a first reference register 203, a second counter 204, a second comparator 205, a second reference register 206, a selection circuit 207, a control pulse generation circuit 210, an up/down counter 211, a digital to analog conversion circuit 212, a selection control signal generation unit 213 and a gate generation circuit 214.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Here, the first counter (precision counter) 201 counts frequency (PATH 1) of the regenerative carrier signal which is generated based on the incoming received signal (hereinafter, sometimes called received IF signal).
      <br/>
      Specifically, interval of the counting is adjusted in response to prescribed counting time outputted from the gate generation circuit 214 which will be mentioned later.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      In other words, because in the regenerative carrier signal the effect of fading is suppressed, more precise counting (precision counting) within a short period of time can be done, than counting directly received IF signal which is counted in the second counter 204 mentioned later.
      <br/>
      Further, the first comparator 202 compares output of the first counter 201 (Cl; first count value) with the first reference value.
      <br/>
      This first reference value is outputted from the first reference register 203 which will be mentioned later.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Furthermore, the first reference register (first reference value setting circuit) 203, having the first reference value for the regenerative carrier signal �R1; reference value for precision counting (theoretical value)�, is outputted from the first comparator 202.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, this first reference value (theoretical value) is established in a design stage.
      <br/>
      Moreover, this first comparator 202, after comparing the first count value (C1) from the first counter 201 with the first reference value (R1), outputs the comparison result (C1-R1) to the selection circuit 207 which will be mentioned later.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Further, the second counter (coarse counter) 204 counts frequency (PATH 2) of the incoming received signal (received IF signal).
      <br/>
      Specifically, same as the first counter 201, interval of the counting is adjusted in response to the prescribed counting time outputted from the gate generation circuit 214 which will be mentioned later.
      <br/>
      In other words, this second counter 204 directly counts the received IF signal from the amplifier unit 15, thus counting larger spacing coarse counting (low accuracy counting) when compared with the first counter 201, instead of counting the regenerative carrier as above mentioned first counter 201.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Further, the second comparator (second comparator) 205 compares the output of the second counter 204 (C2; second count value) with the second reference value.
      <br/>
      This second reference value is outputted from the second reference register 206 which will be mentioned later.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the second reference register (second reference value setting circuit) 206, having the second reference value for the received signal �R2; reference value for coarse counting (theoretical value)�, is outputted from the second comparator 205.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, this second reference value (theoretical value) is established in a design stage, same as the first reference value as described above.

      <br/>
      Specifically, in the selection circuit 215, the frequency of the incoming regenerative carrier signal is selected usually, however, when the signal exceeds the prescribed range, for example, when out of synchronization has been occurred, the selection circuit 215 switches to select the frequency of the received IF signal.

      Furthermore, the counter 201A counts the frequency of the output from the selection circuit 215, and adjusts according to the prescribed counting time outputted from the gate generation circuit 214A which will be mentioned later.

      Specifically, when a signal selected in the selection circuit 215 is the regenerative carrier signal, the counter 201A adjusts according to counting of every 200 msec, for example, same as above mentioned first preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      And when a signal selected in the selection circuit 215 is the received IF signal, the counter 201A adjusts according to counting of every 1 sec, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Furthermore, the comparator 202A compares the output of the counter 201A �C1 or C2; precisely counted value (the first count value) or coarsely counted value (the second count value)� with the reference value.
      <br/>
      This reference value is outputted from the reference register 203A which will be mentioned later.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the reference register (reference value setting circuit) 203A, having the first reference value for the regenerative carrier signal (R1) and the second reference value for the received signal (R2), selectively outputs these first reference value and second reference value, in response to the switching of the selection circuit 215 which will be mentioned later.

      Furthermore, the selection control signal generation unit 213A generates the selection control signal for selecting either the regenerative carrier signal generated based on the received signal or the received signal, its output is outputted to the gate generation circuit 214A, the selection circuit 215 and the reference register 203A, which will be mentioned later.
      <br/>

    <p num="85">
      By such configuration, the automatic frequency control circuit 20A according to the second preferred embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIG. 6, usually counts the frequency of the regenerative carrier signal which is generated based on the incoming received signal, in the counter 201A via the selection circuit 215, then, compares with the reference value in the comparator 202A.
      <br/>
      Then, based on the comparing result, the control pulse generation circuit 210A generates the control pulse signal, the up/down counter 211 increases or decreases corresponding count value with the control pulse signal, and outputs the frequency control signal, outputs to the local oscillator 31 as oscillation frequency analog signal, by analog conversion in the analog to digital conversion circuit 212.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Incidentally, during the course of the series of above mentioned processing, once frequency drift is produced and becomes large, then frequency follow up operation becomes insufficient from the regenerative carrier signal.
      <br/>
      In this case, the frequency control processing will be performed, by switching the frequency used for this automatic frequency control circuit 20A to the frequency of the received IF signal (PATH 2), according to the decision of the mobile station control unit 24.

      On the other hand, when the number of times which exceeded the limit of the follow up range exceeds the prescribed range ("No" route of step d4 of FIG. 8), after restoring previous value just reached the limit of the follow up range (step d6 of FIG. 8), then the frequency control processing employing coarse counting by the counter 201A is forcibly completed.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, in above mentioned step d3, when the difference between the second count value and the second reference value does not exceed the limit of the follow up range on the basis of the regenerative carrier signal ("Yes" route of step d3 of FIG. 8), the selection circuit 215 selects PATH 1 (step d7 of FIG. 8), and after having precision counted in the counter 201A �the first count value (C1); step d8 of FIG. 8�, compares this first count value (C1) with the first reference value (R1) (step d9 of FIG. 8).

    <p num="98">
      From this comparing result, the decision will be made whether the frequency of the input signal is within the convergence range or not ("convergence OK ?"; step d10 of FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      As a result of this decision, when the frequency of the input signal is within the convergence range and when there is no out of synchronization of the input signal, the frequency control processing will be terminated ("Yes" route of step d10 of FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      However, when it is out of the convergence range ("No" route of step d10 of FIG. 8), the decision will be made again whether the number of times which exceeded the limit of the convergence range is within the prescribed range or not (step d11 of FIG. 8).
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      As a result, when the number of times which exceeded the limit of the convergence range is within the prescribed range ("Yes" route of step d11 of FIG. 8), the frequency control processing is performed (step d12 of FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      When the number of times which exceeded the limit of the convergence range is out of the prescribed range ("No" route of step d11 of FIG. 8), after restoring previous value just reached the limit of the convergence range (step d13 of FIG. 8), then the frequency control processing employing coarse counting by the counter 201A is forcibly completed.

    <p num="100">
      Consequently, in this case as well, because a single counter 201A can count by switching counting speed in response to the input signal based on the received signal, the same advantage as above mentioned second preferred embodiment can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, because the counter can rapidly respond to different speed counting process which is started in either speed, flexibility of the system configuration of the equipment will be achieved.

      Furthermore, in the above mentioned second preferred embodiment, although switching of the two modes between the first counter (precision counter) 201 and the second counter (coarse counter) 204 is performed by the mobile station control unit 24 configured by the central processing unit and firm-ware, the present invention is not limited to this preferred embodiment, but the software control by micro processor unit or the random logic control may be employed.

      Although the preferred embodiments have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations not limited to the portable telephone terminal, can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
