      No. 08/673,672, filed Jun. 26, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,790, issued on Jan. 12, 1999.

    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to hematology control compositions and their methods of preparation and use in a reference standard.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to a hematology reference control suspension containing stabilized white blood cells ("WBC") and the nuclei of mammalian WBC or avian or fish erythrocytes.
      <br/>
      Even more particularly this invention relates to a hematology reference control suspension containing stabilized WBC that have been subjected to a whole blood lysing process during their preparation such that in their stabilized state they retain multi-angle light scattering properties.
      <br/>
      This enables the stablized cells, when utilized in a hematology analyzer that differentiates WBC based solely on multi-angle light scatter signals to produce multi-angle light scatter signal that mimic whole blood WBC signals.
      <br/>
      Currently there are several different brands of automated hematology instruments in the marketplace.
      <br/>
      These different analyzers utilize varying detection techniques to quantify neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils.
      <br/>
      Among the detection techniques utilized are: electronic impedance, forward light scatter, polarized 90 (degree)  angle light scatter, depolarized 90 (degree)  angle light scatter, light absorption, radio-frequency and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      The different optical bench designs significantly affect the characteristics of the optical signals obtained from stabilized control cells.
      <br/>
      Since these instruments utilize different detection methods for white blood cell differential analysis ("WBC/Diff"), it has become necessary to utilize different types of WBC/Diff control solutions in order to obtain control cell signatures that are similar to those of whole blood cells when run on that particular type of instrument.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The current class of instruments must utilize either impedance, impedance and light scatter (but not necessarily multi-angle light scatter), or light scatter, impedance and radio frequency signals to differentiate and determine cells from one another.
      <br/>
      Further, these currently available hematology instruments are not able to quantify nucleated red blood cells ("NRBC").
      <br/>
      NRBC interfere with an accurate WBC/Diff analysis.
      <br/>
      The currently available hematology instruments only "flag" for the existence of NRBC in a sample.
      <br/>
      However, the soon to be released Abbott Cell-Dyn.RTM. 4000 hematology analyzer system will be capable of performing a simultaneous whole blood analysis of WBC/Diff and NRBC.
      <br/>
      The Cell-Dyn.RTM. 4000 instrument will perform a simultaneous, whole blood analysis by utilizing only multi-angle light scatter signals, including on occasion fluorescence to differentiate among WBC and NRBC.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it has become necessary to develop a new hematology control for WBC/Diff and NRBC analysis.
      <br/>
      The control cells of this new reference control must possess all of the multi-angle light scattering capabilities of the cells of the whole blood sample that they are suppose to mimic.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      There are in the current realm of art, several patents which describe methods and reagent systems for preparing hematology reference control materials for the current class of analyzers, i.e. those that do not perform an exclusive multi-angle light scatter WBC/Diff analysis.
      <br/>
      The applicants are not aware of any art describing a method or reagent system for the preparation or utilization of a hematology reference control for the multi-angle light scatter analysis of WBC or NRBC.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,364 to Carver et al. and assigned to Coulter Instrument Corp., discloses a method for preparing a three component system which simulates the three major components of human leukocytes.
      <br/>
      However these simulated cells are detected by an impedance based detection system, not a multi-angle light scatter detection system.
      <br/>
      Carver et al. use fixed, red blood cells ("RBC") from the nurse shark to simulate human granulocytes; fixed RBC from turkeys to simulate human mononuclear cells; and fixed human RBC to simulate human lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      The hematology control produce by the teachings of Carver et al. is useful only for electronic impedance measurement of a 3 part WBC/Diff since the three components are only distinguishable by size (impedance), not by optical properties.

      U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,208 to Ryan, discloses a different method of preparing a hematology reference control for WBC/Diff analysis.
      <br/>
      In the Ryan method, aldehyde-fixed human WBC's are suspended in an isotonic aqueous medium comprising lipoprotein in an amount sufficient to provide a mixture that gives a WBC signature profile that is substantially similar to that obtained from whole blood.
      <br/>
      To support his claim, Ryan exhibited a WBC distribution of a Coulter Corp.
      <br/>
      STK-S.RTM. analyzer dot plot, DF1 (abscissa) vs.
      <br/>
      Volume (ordinate).
      <br/>
      It is believed that Ryan's WBC preparation is commercially available under the name of PARA 12.RTM. (Low, Normal &amp; High) Tri-level hematology control from Streck Laboratories.
      <br/>
      The applicants tested this commercial material on a Cell-Dyn.RTM. 4000 analyzer which performs a simultaneous analysis of WBC/Diff and NRBC by multi-angle light scatter (axial light loss, multi-dimensional light scatter and fluorescence.) The results (see FIGS. 5a-5c) reveal that the WBC component of the Ryan preparation generates a significantly different light scatter signature than that obtained from whole blood.
      <br/>
      As can be seen in FIGS. 5a-5c the neutrophil components of the product generated much smaller axial light loss and polarized side scatter signals than that of whole blood; the depolarized side scatter signals from neutrophils are much too large to be separated from that of eosinophils; monocyte cluster does not separate from neutrophil cluster at all; the lymphocyte component generate much higher intermediate angle scatter (7 (degree) ) signals than that of whole blood and thus wiping out the region reserved for basophils by overlapping.

      U.S. Pat. No. 5,320,964 to Young et al. discloses methods and reagent compositions for preparing leukocyte analogs.
      <br/>
      The Young et al. lymphocyte analogs are prepared from fixed goose RBC in a hypotonic phosphate buffered solution (15-25 mOsm/kg); the Monocyte analogs are prepared from fixed alligator RBC in a hypotonic buffered solution (5-15 mOsm/kg); the Eosinophil analogs are also prepared from fixed alligator RBC in a hypotonic solution (75-85 mOsm/kg); and the Neutrophil analogs are prepared from alligator RBC in hypotonic buffered solution (45-65 mOsm/kg).
      <br/>
      Both goose RBC and alligator RBC are elliptical, nucleated and have a smooth cell surface.
      <br/>
      Young et al. claim that the fixed cells prepared according to their procedures simulate at least two different human leukocytes, each having at least two physical properties of a human leukocyte.
      <br/>
      These properties are selected from: a) volume measured by D.C. current; b) high frequency (RF) size; c) opacity; and d) light scatter.
      <br/>
      Although they did not specify the type of light scatter, the Young et al. simulated WBC components prepared from goose and alligator RBC do not have the same characteristics with regard to cell surface structure and cytoplasmic granularity as those of mammalian WBC.
      <br/>
      Consequently, these cells do not generate the multi-angle light scatter signals for polarized and depolarized 90 (degree)  light scatter and axial light loss signals that are substantially equivalent, or similar to that of human whole blood WBC.
      <br/>
      Thus, the Young et al. product cannot be used as a hematology reference control on a sophisticated hematology instruments that utilizes multi-dimensional light scatter, axial light loss and fluorescence signals, such as the Cell-Dyn.RTM. 4000 analyzer, for WBC/Diff and NRBC quantification.
      <br/>
      In fact, if the cells of Young et al. are fixed in a hypotonic buffered solution one of two results will occur.
      <br/>
      First, if the osmolarity of the solution is very low (5-25 mOsm/kg) the cytoplasm of the cells will lyse.
      <br/>
      If, on the other hand, the osmolarity is about (85 mOsm/kg) the cell volume will expand.

      FIGS. 18a-18d show the results of a multi-parameter, light scatter based analysis of a control cell solution containing fixed alligator RBC as the control cells.

    <p num="18">
      Broadly, the present invention relates to the method for the preparation of a stable WBC and NRBC component and the hematology reference control solution containing one or more of these components.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="20">
      Any automated system for the detection and differentiation of cells requires the utilization of reference controls to assure that the system is operating properly.
      <br/>
      This is true no matter what detection system is employed.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      With the advent of a new detection scheme, mainly that of utilizing only multi-angle/parameter light scatter signals to differentiate and distinguish WBC subpopulations and NRBC in a sample (to the exclusion of all other non-light signals), new controls have become necessary.
      <br/>
      Current, state of the art reference controls will not perform properly on such multi-parameter systems.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The present inventors have discovered why the current controls do not work on multi-angle light scatter based hematology analyzers and devised methods for producing controls that will work.
      <br/>
      Not only will the present invention controls perform on multi-parameter light scatter based systems, but they should also perform on other detection based systems as well.
      <br/>
      This is because the cells of the new controls are the same cells as is found in a blood sample, only processed.
      <br/>
      Therefore they retain the cell's light scattering characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The cellular components of the reference control suspensions of this invention substantially mimic the multi-parameter light scattering characteristics of the WBC or NRBC in a whole blood sample when run on a multi-parameter light scatter based detection system.</p>
    <p num="24">
      For the purposes of this invention multi-parameter, multi-angle, or multi-dimensional light scatter encompasses the exclusive use of (i.e., excludes non-) polarized and depolarized 90 (degree)  light scatter and axial light loss signals, and combinations thereof to determine or differentiate the cells of interest.
      <br/>
      No other non-light based signals are utilized for this determination.
      <br/>
      Other types of light signals may also be utilized, such as fluorescence, but impedance and other non-light based signals are not used.
      <br/>
      However, instruments which do use non-light based signals, or combinations of light scatter and impedance for example, can also benefit from the controls of this invention, but it is the multi-angle light scatter based instruments which will benefit the most as there are currently no such controls available.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The WBC components of the control suspension of this invention are WBC from blood that have been subjected to a very gentle lysing environment (similar to the environment they would have been subjected to in the analyzer had that blood sample been analyzed), and then fixed.
      <br/>
      The same is true for the NRBC components as well, the nuclei are exposed to a lysing environment and fixed to preserve their cellular characteristics.
      <br/>
      With the NRBC component however, mammalian nucleated blood cells are not the only cells that can be used as the source of the freed nuclei.
      <br/>
      Avian or fish erythrocytes can also utilized for this fraction.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The ability of the control cells to mimic the light scattering characteristics of the cells of interest is due to the fact that the cells are first chosen because of their cellular composition (i.e., their light scattering characteristics).
      <br/>
      During the manufacturing process these cellular components of the control cells are preserved by first subjecting them to a gentile lysing environment to lyse RBC; then the remaining WBC and NRBC nuclei are fixed before the lysing environment has destroyed the desired cellular characteristics.
      <br/>
      This manufacturing process mimics the environment "real" blood cells are subjected to in the interior passages of the analyzer.
      <br/>
      The control cells, because they are "fixed", are not significantly affected by the lysing environment when they pass through the analyzer, so they retain their desired characteristics.
      <br/>
      In addition, the fixed cells are stable in the control solution, where whole blood cells are not.
      <br/>
      However, it is believed that the control cells need to be subjected to the same or similar lysing environment that the blood cells in a sample while see in an analyzer in order to produce substantially the same refractive index, which primarily determines the light scattering characteristics of a cell.
      <br/>
      In this way the control cells will appear to the instrument to be the "instrument lysed" cells of interest and be recorded as such.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      It has also been determined that the same cellular components of the present invention, if "fixed" prior to subjecting them to a lysing environment, do not perform satisfactorily in a multi-angle light scattering based system.
      <br/>
      The cells need to be subjected to a lysing environment before they are "fixed".
      <br/>
      Later, when they are processed as control cells in the analyzer these processed cells will "appear", to the analyzer, to be the blood cells of interest.
      <br/>
      This is because the multi-parameter light, scatter based analyzers are only programmed to recognize whole blood cells in the analyzer's internal processing environment.
      <br/>
      So, unless the reference control cells, or cellular components, retain the appropriate cellular characteristic and therefore, react or behave (scatter light and/or fluoresce) in a manner that is substantially similar to whole blood, they will "appear" to be different cells to the analyzer or be completely unrecognizable.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Therefore, the primary methods of this invention subject cells or cellular components to a lysing environment during the reference control manufacturing process and prior to their "fixation" that they will encounter in the analyzer when they are run as reference controls.</p>
