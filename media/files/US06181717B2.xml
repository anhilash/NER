      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates generally to semiconductor lasers, and more particularly to a semiconductor laser diode system with a control loop that provides a controlled output beam of selected wavelength in response to a changes in temperature of the diode or changes in output beam wavelength.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      There are stringent requirements on the stability of the output wavelength and the output power of semiconductor laser units used for optical communication, and specifically for dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM).
      <br/>
      Typically, the lasers used for these applications are distributed feedback (DFB) semiconductor lasers.
      <br/>
      At fixed driving current, the output power and wavelength of these devices varies strongly with temperature.
      <br/>
      Typically the wavelength change is 0.6  Angstrom / (degree) C. Over an operating range of 0 to 75 degrees Celsius, this wavelength change is 4.5 nm. In DWDM systems the channel spacing is 0.8 nm or 0.4 nm so this wavelength variation is unacceptable.
      <br/>
      In addition, aging of the laser will also cause a change in wavelength.
      <br/>
      To overcome this problem DFB lasers are packaged with a temperature sensor and a cooler which operate in a closed loop to maintain the laser at a fixed temperature.
      <br/>
      At a fixed temperature the laser wavelength variation is minimized.
      <br/>
      Thermal control systems used with laser diodes have included the combination of a photodiode, thermoelectric cooler and thermistor.
      <br/>
      The photodiode receives a portion of the output of the diode laser.
      <br/>
      The output from the laser diode is stabilized by a feedback drive circuit and a reference adjust variable resistor.
      <br/>
      A temperature feedback circuit uses a thermistor and the reference adjust resistor to provide feedback stabilization of the laser diode temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,860 discloses a cooling system for a laser diode that includes a temperature sensitive switch.
      <br/>
      When a temperature exceeds a given temperature the switch is open.
      <br/>
      Coupled to the switch is a thermoelectric cooler that cools the laser diode.
    </p>
    <p num="6">To provide more precise control of the wavelength, the wavelength can be monitored. U.S. Pat. No. 5,867,513 discloses a semiconductor laser unit in which the temperature is controlled in a closed loop which monitors the output wavelength of the laser.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Thermoelectric coolers generally require larger, more expensive power supplies than would otherwise be used.
      <br/>
      The use of thermoelectric coolers has proven to waste a significant amount of power from the power source.
      <br/>
      In one device, one or more voltage regulators are used to regulate the power supplied to a thermoelectric cooler.
      <br/>
      The power used by the voltage regulator is wasted.
      <br/>
      In addition the thermoelectric cooler itself adds to the cost of manufacturing the laser. U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,974 discloses one embodiment of a temperature insensitive wavelength meter and wavelength compensation for a KrF excimer laser as a method of avoiding the use of costly temperature control.
      <br/>
      Excimer lasers produce light in the UV wavelength range and are not appropriate for communications applications.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIG. 1, one embodiment of the present invention is a tunable semiconductor laser system is generally denoted as numeral 10 and includes a laser 12.
      <br/>
      Laser 12 is preferably tunable and generates a divergent output beam.
      <br/>
      Laser 12 can be any single mode semiconductor diode laser.
      <br/>
      Preferably, laser 12 is a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL), an output facet of a single mode fiber (SMF) or an edge emitting laser.
      <br/>
      The output beam from laser 12 is preferably utilized for communication applications, with a wavelength in the range of 800 nm to 1650 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Laser 12 has a semiconductor active region positioned between upper and lower confining regions of opposite type semiconductor material.
      <br/>
      Laser 12 also includes first and second reflectors positioned at opposing edges of the active and confining regions.
      <br/>
      A wavelength tuning member 14 and a temperature sensor 16 are each coupled to laser 12.
      <br/>
      A control loop, denoted as 18, is coupled to temperature sensor 16 and tuning member 14.
      <br/>
      In response to a detected change in temperature of laser 12, control loop 18 sends an adjustment signal to tuning member 14.
      <br/>
      Tuning member 14 adjusts either voltage or current supplied to laser 12 in order to provide a controlled output beam of a selected wavelength.
      <br/>
      System 10 does not require active cooling and is suitable for use in WDM communication systems.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Preferably, laser 12 is a tunable laser.
      <br/>
      Suitable lasers 12 include but are not limited to are 3 stage and 4 stage DFB lasers and tunable VCSEL lasers.
      <br/>
      In addition, an applied voltage or current controls the output power of the laser.
      <br/>
      Laser 12 can include a sealing cap, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Application, Attorney Docket No. 21123-703, filed on the same date as this application, and incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In one embodiment of system 10, illustrated in FIG. 2, only the output power and the temperature of laser 12 are measured.
      <br/>
      The output power of laser 12 is kept constant by controlling the power applied to laser 12 in a closed feedback loop.
      <br/>
      The wavelength of laser 12 is controlled in an open loop where a control circuit tunes laser 12 to correct for a calibrated wavelength drift according to the measured temperature.
      <br/>
      Electronics 20 are employed in both the open and closed feedback loops and include but are not limited to op-amplifiers, resistors, capacitors, transistors and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In another embodiment of system 10, illustrated in FIG. 3, both the output power and the wavelength of laser 12 are measured.
      <br/>
      Closed feedback loops control both the laser power and the laser wavelength.
      <br/>
      The temperature is also measured, and the measurement is used to correct any error due to temperature in the wavelength and power measurements.
      <br/>
      The wavelength of laser 12 is stabilized in a closed feedback loop in which the wavelength of the laser output is measured.
      <br/>
      Temperature measurement is used to correct for the known temperature drift of the wavelength measurement and the power measurement.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Suitable temperature sensors 16 include but are not limited to thermistors, bipolar transistors, diode circuits and the like.
      <br/>
      Temperature sensor circuits for use with silicon CMOS technology are described in U.S. Pat. 5,829,879 and "CMOS-Compatible Smart Temperature Sensors" by R. A. Bianchi et. al., Microelectronics Journal v. 29, pp. 627-636 (1998), all incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Referring to FIG. 4(a), laser 12 and sensor 16, including but not limited to a transistor or diode temperature measurement circuit, can be positioned and/or formed on the same substrate or chip 22.
      <br/>
      This is particularly advantageous for surface emitting devices.
      <br/>
      Another temperature measurement technique implemented on the same chip 22 is a bimetallic cantilever. (See "Micromechanics: A Toolbox for Femtoscale Science: `Towards a Laboratory on a Tip.`" by R. Berger et. al., Microelectronic Engineering v. 35, pp. 373-379 (1997)), incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      After system 10 is turned on, a current I is applied to laser 12 so that laser 12 produces an optical power P, and a voltage V is applied to the laser tuning mechanism so that the lasing wavelength is  LAMBDA .
      <br/>
      A small fraction of the output of laser 12 is sent through a wavelength selective filter, including but not limited to a Fabry-Perot etalon and into a detector.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      As illustrated in FIG. 4(b) temperature sensor 16 supplies a current or voltage proportional to the temperature which is subtracted off (or added to) the detector current to correct for the temperature drift of the Fabry-Perot etalon.
      <br/>
      The corrected detector current is compared to a set current which corresponds to a predetermined wavelength,  LAMBDA 0.
      <br/>
      If  LAMBDA  is greater than  LAMBDA 0, the measured detector current will be smaller than the set current, as more fully described hereafter and illustrated in FIGS. 19(a) and 19(b), and if  LAMBDA  is less than  LAMBDA 0, the measured current will be greater than the set current.
      <br/>
      The difference between the measured and set current is sent through a proportional-integral circuit which applies a voltage to tuning member 14.
      <br/>
      If  LAMBDA  is not equal to  LAMBDA 0, the voltage applied to tuning member 14 increases (or decrease) until  LAMBDA  equals  LAMBDA 0 when the input to the circuit will be 0 and the voltage will stabilize at a constant value.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In a similar manner, a small fraction of the output of laser 12 is sent directly into the detector to monitor laser 12 power.
      <br/>
      A current proportional to the temperature is subtracted off (or added to) the detector current to compensate for the change in detector response with temperature.
      <br/>
      This corrected current is then compared to a set value which corresponds to the desired output power of laser 12.
      <br/>
      The difference between the corrected detector current and the set current is sent to a proportional integral circuit which will apply a current to laser 12.
      <br/>
      If the laser power is to low, the current to laser 12 is increased by the circuit until it is at the proper value, and if the power is too high, the current is decreased.
    </p>
    <p num="26">In this way, the power and wavelength of system 10 output remains constant despite changes in the temperature.</p>
    <p num="27">
      One embodiment of laser 12 is a VCSEL with a cantilever apparatus that uses an electrostatic force that pulls on a cantilever arm.
      <br/>
      The mechanical deflection resulting from this electrostatic force is used to change the length of the laser's Fabry-Perot microcavity and consequently to the resonance wavelength.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As illustrated in FIG. 5, cantilever apparatus 24 has a cantilever structure 26 consisting of a base 28, an arm 30 and an active head 32.
      <br/>
      The bulk of cantilever structure 26 may consist of a plurality of reflective layers 34 which form a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR).
      <br/>
      Layers can be formed of different materials including but not limited to AlGaAs.

      Different compositional ratios are used for individual layers 34, e.g., Al.09 Ga.91 As/Al.58 Ga.42 As. The topmost layer is heavily doped to ensure good contact with an electrical tuning contact 36 deposited on top of cantilever structure 26.

      The actual number of layers 34 may vary from 1 to 20 and more, depending on the desired reflectivity of the DBR.

      Furthermore, any suitable reflecting material other than AlGaAs may be used to produce layers 34.
      <br/>
      Active head 32 is made of layers 34.
      <br/>
      However, arm 30 and base 28 do not need to be made of layers 34.

    <p num="30">
      Base 28 can have a variety of different geometric configurations and large enough to maintain dimensional stability of cantilever structure 26.
      <br/>
      The width of arm 30 ranges typically from 2 to 8 mu m while its length is 25 to 100 mu m or more.
      <br/>
      The stiffness of arm 30 increases as its length decreases.
      <br/>
      Consequently, shorter cantilevers require greater forces to achieve bending but shorter cantilevers also resonate at a higher frequency.
      <br/>
      The preferred diameter of active head 32 falls between 5 and 40 mu m. Other dimensions are suitable.

      Base 28 is coupled to a single support post 37 and mounted on a substrate 38 across which a voltage can be sustained.
      <br/>
      Substrate 38 can include a second DBR 39.

      <br/>
      If layers 34 and substrate 38 are oppositely doped, then a reverse bias voltage can be established between them.

      Positioned along optical axis 116 is a wavelength selective filter 120.

      Suitable wavelength selective filters 120 include but are not limited to a Bragg grading, multilayer-thin-film filter, solid Fabry-Perot etalon or an air gap etalon.
      <br/>
      Preferably wavelength selective filter 120 is a Fabry-Perot etalon or a multilayer-thin-film filter.
      <br/>
      Wavelength selective filter 120 can be tilted at an angle  THETA  relative to optical axis 116 to provide an angular dependence of a wavelength reflection of wavelength selective filter 120 and direct the reflected output beam 114 towards photodetector 124.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9 illustrates a change in angle  THETA .
      <br/>
      Wavelength selective filter 120 is distanced from laser 112 and tilted at the angle  THETA  relative to optical axis 116 in order to provide an angular dependence of wavelength reflection from wavelength selective filter 120.

      Wavelength selective filter 120 splits incident output beam 114 into a transmitted portion and a reflected portion.
      <br/>
      The ratio of the transmitted and reflected portions is a function of wavelength of output beam 114 and the angle  THETA  that is defined by an incident face 119 of wavelength selective filter 120 relative to the incident beam.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Received power by photodetector 124 is a function of wavelength.
      <br/>
      When the wavelength of output beam 114 changes, there is change in received power by photodetector 124.
      <br/>
      When the total output power of output beam 114 is a constant, any change in received power at photodetector 124 is used as an indication that there has been a change in the wavelength of laser 112.
    </p>
    <p num="37">When wavelength selective filter 120 reflects a portion of output beam 114 to photodetector 124, the result is a compact assembly that can be an integral unit with monolithic integration of laser 112 with photodetector 124 on the same chip.</p>

      The divergence of laser 112 can be controlled by a lens 121 which can be an aspherical lens, a cylindrical lens, a spherical lens, a graded index lens of plastic or glass, and the like.
      <br/>
      A larger spot size gives wavelength selective filter 120 a shape closer to desired and provides better power transfer to photodetector 124.

      For dense WDM applications, where precise wavelengths are required, a differential detection scheme is utilized to further enhance accuracy.
      <br/>
      A differential detection scheme compares the output from a pair of photodetectors 124.
      <br/>
      When there is an array, there is still a comparison between a pair of adjacent or non-adjacent photodetectors 124, one comparison made at a time.
      <br/>
      With a pair of photodetectors 124, a difference in response of the two photodetectors 124 is used to determine wavelength deviation from a pre-set wavelength.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Usually, output beam 114 is divergent.
      <br/>
      This divergence is used as an advantage for differential detection schemes.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 10, when output beam 114 is divergent there is a range of incident angles  THETA min to  THETA max on face 119.
      <br/>
      The larger the divergence, the larger the difference between  THETA min and  THETA max.
      <br/>
      When laser 112, photodetector 124 and wavelength selective filter 20 are in fixed positions relative to each other, and a beam receiving area of photodetector 124 is small, photodetector 124 only receives the portion of reflected output beam 114 with a particular incident angle  THETA 1.

      In FIG. 10 a second photodetector 128 is included and positioned adjacent to photodetector 124.

      In this embodiment, two different parts of output beam 114 are incident on photodetectors 124 and 128.

      FIG. 11 illustrates in one example of light reflected off wavelength selective element 120 that is received by photodiode 124 when the wavelength of the light output from laser 112 changes.

    <p num="43">
      Referring again to FIG. 10, second photodetector 128 is distanced from first photodetector 128 and receives a different portion of the reflected output beam 114 with a different incident angle  THETA 2.
      <br/>
      Because of the difference of the incidence angles, the optical path lengths are different for the two portions of output beam 114 received by the respective photodetectors 124 and 128.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the relationship between the received power at each photodetector 124 and 128 verses wavelength is shifted.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      This shift is determined by the distance between photodetectors 124 and 128, their distance from face 119 of wavelength selective element 120, and the distance between wavelength selective element 120 to laser 112, as illustrated in FIG. 12. At point E, at which the responses from photodetectors 124 and 128 are equal, this is used in setting up the target wavelengths for wavelength locking purposes.
      <br/>
      Any deviation from the wavelengths results in a difference in response intensity at the two photodetectors.
      <br/>
      This difference can be used in a feedback control loop to change the wavelength of laser 112 back to the target wavelength, as described in greater detail hereafter.
      <br/>
      In WDM applications each communication channel is set at a predetermined wavelength.
      <br/>
      The wavelength of each transmitter output should be stabilized to much better than the channel spacing.
      <br/>
      For example, for 50 GHz channel spacing, the wavelengths should be stabilized to at least 5 GHz.

      <br/>
      The signal received by each photodetector 124 and 128 is dependent on the wavelength emitted by laser 112.
      <br/>
      Because of the angular dependence of wavelength selective filter 120 a wavelength variation from laser 112 is converted to a transmission and reflection change.
      <br/>
      The wavelength change is detected as a power change.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the output signals from photodetectors 124 and 128 are used to generate a difference signal in differential amplifier 134 which is fed to integrator circuit 136 for controlling the output wavelength of laser 112.
      <br/>
      By arranging that the reflection detected by photodetectors 124 and 128 is the same at a selected wavelength, the difference signal is set to be zero at the predetermined wavelength (the locked wavelength).
      <br/>
      The locked wavelength can be set with equivalent stability to different values by using unequal gains for photodetectors 124 and 128.
      <br/>
      If the wavelength of laser 112 changes the differential signal generated by photodetectors 124 and 128, the error signal, is wavelength dependent and is used to monitor the wavelength of laser 112.
