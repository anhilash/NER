      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to a disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus having plural recording and/or reproducing units.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Background of the Invention</p>
    <p num="5">
      In recent years, there has been an increase in popularity of disc recording and/or reproducing apparatuses for recording and/or reproducing information signals on or from a disc-shaped recording medium, such as an optical disc or a magneto-optical disc.
      <br/>
      Such a disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus includes a disc driving unit rotated along with a disc and which is adapted for writing/reading information signals on or from the rotated disc.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The disc driving unit includes a disc table adapted for holding the disc and which is rotated along with this disc by a motor operating as a driving source.
      <br/>
      The disc driving unit also includes an optical pickup unit and a magnetic head unit for recording or reading out information signals on or from the disc rotated along with the disc table.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      With the disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus, the disc is positioned on the disc table with a chucking center aperture as a reference, and is held in this condition by a holder for rotation.
      <br/>
      By the head unit, the information signals are recorded on or read out from the recording disc.
    </p>
    <p num="8">There also exists a multiple disc changer, in which a plurality of discs are housed and held within a disc stocker in an outer casing, and a selected one of the discs is taken out of the disc stocker and loaded on the disc driving unit for recording and/or reproduction.</p>
    <p num="9">Such a disc changer has one or more disc driving units and a transporting mechanism for transporting discs between the disc stocker and the disc driving unit or between the disc driving units.</p>
    <p num="10">
      The transporting mechanism selectively takes out and transports a disc from the disc stocker and loads the selected disc on the disc driving unit.
      <br/>
      The transporting mechanism also dismounts the disc loaded on the disc driving unit and returns the disc to an original housing position in the disc stocker.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      With the above-described disc changer, if there is provided only one disc driving unit, the disc transporting distance by the transporting mechanism is increased, thus complicating the structure of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      Since the recording and/or reproducing operation is carried out by a single disc driving unit, it becomes difficult to exchange the discs promptly, so that it becomes difficult to perform recording and/or reproduction of multiple recording discs without interruptions.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus which resolves the above-mentioned problem.</p>
    <p num="13">
      According to the present invention, there is provided a disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus including first and second recording and/or reproducing units and a supporting member.
      <br/>
      The first disc recording and/or reproducing unit records and/or reproduces a disc, while the second disc recording and/or reproducing unit also records and/or reproduces a disc.
      <br/>
      The supporting member supports the first and second recording and/or reproducing units in a layered fashion.
      <br/>
      The first recording and/or reproducing unit is provided on one surface of the supporting member, while the second recording and/or reproducing unit is provided on the other surface of the supporting member.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      According to the present invention, there is also provided a disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus including first and second recording and/or reproducing units and a supporting member.
      <br/>
      The first disc recording and/or reproducing unit records and/or reproduces a disc, while the second disc recording and/or reproducing unit also records and/or reproduces a disc.
      <br/>
      The supporting unit supports the first and second recording and/or reproducing units.
      <br/>
      The supporting unit supports the first and second recording and/or reproducing units so that, in the disc recording and/or reproducing states of the first and second recording and/or reproducing units, the discs run parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      The second recording and/or reproducing units are arranged in a layered fashion with respect to the first recording and/or reproducing unit with the supporting unit in between.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to the drawings, preferred embodiments of the disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus according to the present invention will be explained in detail.
      <br/>
      The following description is made with reference to an optical disc as a disc-shaped recording medium and to a disc player for reproducing the optical disc as the disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The disc player according to the present first embodiment has a main body portion 1, as shown in FIGS. 1 through 3.
      <br/>
      The main body portion 1 is formed as a flat plate substantially corresponding in size to optical discs 101, 102 to be reproduced by the disc player.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The optical discs 101, 102 are disc-shaped recording media having pre-set diameters, such as 120 mm, 80 mm or 64 mm, and may be a so-called optical disc or a magneto-optical disc.
      <br/>
      Each of the optical discs 101, 102 has a circular center chucking aperture.
      <br/>
      The optical discs 101, 102 may also be used while it is packaged within a disc cartridge in the form of a thin rectangular casing instead of being used in the unpackaged form.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A disc drive 22 for loading the disc 101 therein is arranged on the upper surface of the main body portion 1 of the disc player.
      <br/>
      On the lower surface of the main body portion 1 is arranged a second disc driving unit 28 for loading the second optical disc 102.
    </p>
    <p num="20">These disc driving units 22, 28 are provided with disc tables 20, 27, respectively, adapted for being rotated by spindle motors 29, 31, and with optical pickup units 21, 35, respectively, adapted for being moved into and out of contact with the disc tables 20, 27, respectively, as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8.</p>
    <p num="21">
      The disc driving units 22, 28 are provided with first and second frames 32, 33, respectively.
      <br/>
      These frames 32, 33 are fitted with spindle motors 29, 31 and optical pickup units 21, 35, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Each of the disc tables 20, 27 is formed in a substantially disc form having a diameter corresponding to the shape of a non-recording area towards the center of the disc.
      <br/>
      At the center of the upper surfaces of the disc tables 20, 27 are formed chuck protrusions 19, 26, substantially in the frusto-conical shape, engaged in chucking apertures of the optical discs 101, 102, respectively, for positioning the discs 101, 102 with respect to the disc tables 20, 27, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Plural ball members 44 are enclosed in the inside of the chuck protrusions 19, 26 to partially protrude from the outer peripheral surfaces thereof.
      <br/>
      These ball members 44 are elastically biased towards the outer periphery to radially protrude from the center of the disc tables 20, 27.
    </p>
    <p num="24">When the chuck protrusions 19, 26 are engaged in the chucking apertures of the optical discs 101, 102, these ball members 44 thrust the inner peripheral portions of the chucking apertures radially outwardly to hold the optical discs 101, 102 with respect to the disc tables 20, 27, respectively.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The disc tables are provided with openings engaged by spindle shafts of the spindle motors 29, 31 along the center axes, respectively.
      <br/>
      The disc tables are mounted on the distal ends of the driving shafts, that is spindle shafts, of the spindle motors 29, 31, by having the spindle shafts engaged in these openings.
      <br/>
      The disc tables 20, 27, with the optical discs 101, 102 held thereby in position, are rotated by the spindle motors 29, 31, along with the optical discs 101, 102, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Each of the optical pickup units 21, 35 has an optical block, within which are enclosed a semiconductor laser, as a light source, an objective lens for converging the light beam radiated by the semiconductor laser to a recording layer of each of the optical discs 101, 102, an optical element for guiding the light beam radiated by the semiconductor laser to the objective lens and a photodetector for detecting the light beam incident via the objective lens after reflection by the recording layer.</p>
    <p num="27">Each of the optical pickup units 21, 35 is arranged so that the objective lens faces each of the optical discs 101, 102 held and rotated by the disc tables 20, 27, the light beam radiated by the light source is condensed on the recording layer of each of the optical discs 101, 102 for recording or reading the information signals on or from the recording layer.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The optical pickup units 21, 35 are supported by frames 32, 33, respectively, for radial movement with respect to the disc, that is in a direction towards and away from the disc tables 20, 27, respectively.
      <br/>
      These optical pickup units 21, 35 are moved radially with respect to the disc, by a transmission mechanism, as later explained, under the driving force of pickup feed motors 36 mounted on each of the frames 32, 33, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The structure of the mechanism for transmitting the driving power from the feed motor 36 to the optical pickup unit is as follows: A driving shaft 37 is mounted on a driving shaft of the pickup feed motor 36.
      <br/>
      The driving shaft 37 meshes with a transmission gear 38 rotatably supported by the frame 32 or 33.
      <br/>
      The transmission gear 38 meshes with a follower gear 39 rotatably supported by the frame 32 or 33.
      <br/>
      On the follower gear 39 is coaxially and integrally mounted a screw shaft 40.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The outer periphery of the screw shaft 40 has screw flutes engaged by the optical block of the optical pickup unit 21 or 35.
      <br/>
      The driving power from the motor 36 is transmitted to the screw shaft 40 via gears 37, 38 for rotating the screw shaft.
      <br/>
      This causes the optical pickup unit 21 or 35 to be fed axially with respect to the screw shaft 40.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The optical pickup unit 21 of the first disc driving unit 22 is moved across the inner and outer rims of the first optical disc 101 held and rotated by the disc table 20 for reading out the information signals from the entire surface of the signal recording area of the first optical disc 101.</p>
    <p num="32">The optical pickup unit 35 of the second disc driving unit 28 is moved across the inner and outer rims of the second optical disc 102 held and rotated by the disc table 27 for reading out the information signals from the entire surface of the signal recording area of the second optical disc 102.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The first disc driving unit is arranged on the frame 33, while the second disc driving unit is arranged on the frame 32, as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Stated differently, the first disc driving unit 22 and the second disc driving unit 28 are arranged on the outer sides of the two parallel surfaces delimited by the frames 32, 33.
      <br/>
      In the arrangement shown in FIG. 4, the first disc driving unit 22 and the second disc driving units 28 are arranged on the upper and lower sides of the main body portion 1, respectively.
      <br/>
      The first disc driving unit 22 and the second disc driving unit 28 are arranged in the main body portion 1 so that the sides of the optical discs 101, 102 scanned by the optical pickup units 21, 35 face each other via frames 32, 33 and so that the discs 101, 102 run substantially parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      The spindle motors 29, 31 of the first and second disc driving units 22, 28 are arranged so that the center of rotation of one of the spindle motors is offset with respect to that of the other spindle motor for reducing the thickness of the disc player in its entirety, as shown in FIGS. 3 through 5.
      <br/>
      As a principle, there is no limit as to the amount or direction of offset as long as there is no overlap between the two centers of rotation in the cross-section of the disc player.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The main body portion 1 is provided with an upper lid 2 and a lower lid 3 which are rotatably mounted for opening and closing the upper and lower surfaces of the main body portion 1, that is the upper sides of the first and second disc driving units 22, 28, as shown in FIGS. 4 through 6.
      <br/>
      These upper and lower lids 2, 3 may be selectively opened by actuating a lid-opening knob 4 provided on the front side of the main body portion 1.
      <br/>
      If the knob 4 is rotated in the direction of arrow A, the upper lid 2 is opened, as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      If the knob 4 is rotated in the direction of arrow D, the lower lid 3 is opened, as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The mechanism of the knob 4 will be explained subsequently.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The upper lid 2 and the lower lid 3 are connected at rear ends thereof by hinges 11, 11 associated with the main body portion and by hinges 12, 12 associated with the lids to rotate the lids relative to the main body portion 1, as shown in FIG. 5.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The hinges 11, 11 associated with the main body portion 1 are formed at left and right sides on the rear ends of the upper and lower surfaces of the main body portion 1.
      <br/>
      The hinges 12, 12 associated with the upper lid 2 are provided at the left and right sides on the rear end of the upper lid 2, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 4.
      <br/>
      The lid side hinges 12, 12 associated with the upper lid 2 are engaged with the upper side hinges 11, 11 associated with the main body portion 1 for rotatably mounting the upper lid 2.
      <br/>
      The hinges 12, 12 associated with the lower lid 3 are provided at the left and right sides on the rear end of the lower lid 3, as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6.
      <br/>

      The lid-opening knob 4 has an upper engagement pawl 13 and a slidable lower engagement pawl 52, as shown in FIGS. 14 through 18.
      <br/>
      The engagement pawls 13, 52 are hooked in profile and protrude upwards and downwards, respectively, from the front edge of the main body portion 1.
      <br/>
      The bending direction of the hook shape of the engagement pawl 13 and that of the engagement pawl 52 are reversed relative to each other and extend along the sliding direction of the lid-opening knob 4.

      A first control protrusion 59 provided on the main body portion 1 is clamped between two arm portions of the torsion coil spring 58.
      <br/>
      A second control protrusion 60 formed on the lid-opening knob 4 is similarly clamped between the two arm portions of the torsion coil spring 58.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Therefore, if the lid-opening knob 4 is slid in either direction away from the mid position of the slide range as indicated by arrow E in FIG. 17, the distance between the first and second control protrusions 58, 60 is enlarged, as a result of which the distance between the first and second control protrusions 58, 60 is diminished by the arm portions of the torsion coil spring 58 hence the lid-opening knob 4 is elastically biased for being restored to the mid position, as indicated by arrow F in FIG. 17.</p>

      The present disc player may be provided on one of the lids 2 and 3, for example, on the lower lid 3, with a third disc driving unit 18 for loading a third optical disc 103 thereon, so that the driving unit 18 will face the main body portion 1, as shown in FIGS. 9 through 13.
      <br/>
      Such a disc player according to a second embodiment of the present invention is now explained in detail with reference to FIGS. 9 through 13.
      <br/>
      Elements which are common with the first embodiment are denoted by the same reference numerals and the detailed description of these elements is omitted clarity.
    </p>
    <p num="60">Similar to the first two disc driving units 22, 28, the third disc driving unit 18 includes a spindle motor 30 mounted on a frame 34, a disc table 16 mounted on a driving shaft of the spindle motor 30 and having a positioning chuck protrusion 15, and an optical pickup unit 17 mounted for movement relative to the frame 34.</p>
    <p num="61">The third disc driving unit 18 is arranged on the upper surface of the lower lid 3 so that the disc table 16 is positioned on the side of the main body portion 1.</p>
    <p num="62">
      Stated differently, the third disc driving unit 18 is arranged on the lower lid 3 so that the disc table 16 of the third disc driving unit 18 will face the disc table 26 of the second disc driving unit 28.
      <br/>
      The third disc driving unit 18 is arranged so that the scanning surface by the optical pickup unit 17 of the optical disc 103 loaded on the third driving unit 18 is oriented in the same direction as the scanning surface by the optical pickup unit 21 of the optical disc 103 loaded on the first driving unit 22.
      <br/>
      This means that, with the present second embodiment, the third optical disc driving unit is arranged at a position corresponding to the parallel displacement of the first disc driving unit towards the lower side in FIG. 12. The distance between the second disc driving unit 28 and the third disc driving unit 18 is such a distance in which the optical discs 102, 103 loaded on the disc driving units 28, 18, respectively, are not abutted against each other, while the optical discs 102, 103 are also not abutted against each other when the disc are run in rotation.

    <p num="83">
      In the disc player of the fourth embodiment, a spindle motor 290 has a single rotary shaft 291 extending vertically from a main motor portion, as indicated in FIGS. 21 and 22. The one end of the rotary shaft 291, or the upper end thereof in FIG. 22, carries the disc table 20 of the first disc driving unit 22, while the opposite end of the rotary shaft, or the lower end thereof in FIG. 22, carries the disc table 27 of the second disc driving unit 28.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, the spindle motor 290 is mounted on one of the frames 22 and 28.
      <br/>
      However the spindle motor 290 may also be clamped between the frames 22 and 28.
      <br/>
      The direction of rotation of the spindle motor 290 is switched depending on whether the optical disc is reproduced by the first disc driving unit 22 or by the second disc driving unit 28.
      <br/>
      The direction of the spindle motor 290 when reproducing the optical disc by the second disc driving unit 28 is reversed from the direction of the spindle motor when of reproducing the optical disc by the first disc driving unit 28.
      <br/>
      The direction of rotation of the spindle motor 290 is switched responsive to a control signal from a controller (not shown).

      The optical pickup unit 21 of the first disc driving unit 22 and the optical disc driving unit 35 of the second disc driving unit 28 are arrayed on both sides of the spindle motor 290 for movement on the same straight line, as shown in FIG. 23.
    </p>
    <p num="84">In the fourth embodiment of the disc player, since the number of the spindle motors is reduced compared to that of the above-described embodiments, not only can the entire disc player be reduced in thickness, but the player device can be reduced in planar size compared to the disc players of the first to third embodiments, as shown in FIG. 23. The reason is that, with the present fourth embodiment, the optical disc 101 overlapps with the optical disc 102 in the disc player, as shown in FIG. 23.</p>
    <p num="85">In the disc player according to the present invention, by loading the recording discs in the associated disc driving units, the information signals can be continuously recorded and/or reproduced on or from the recording discs without transporting the optical discs within the apparatus.</p>
    <p num="86">That is, the disc player according to the present invention can perform continuous recording and/or reproduction of information signals on or from plural recording discs despite the fact that it has a simplified structure, small size and light weight.</p>
    <p num="87">Although the foregoing description has been made with reference to a disc player, as a disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus, for reproducing an optical disc, as a disc-shaped recording medium, the disc-shaped recording medium may also be a magnetic disk, while a recording and/or reproducing apparatus may also be substituted for the disc player.</p>
