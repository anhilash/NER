      <br/>
      This invention relates to an apparatus and method for determining paperboard thermal conductivity.
      <br/>
      Such structures of this type, generally, determine the thermal conductivity of a planar material, such as paperboard or insulating foams.
      <br/>
      The apparatus is designed to characterize the heat flow from a heated brass cylinder, through a flat paperboard sample, and into another brass cylinder.
      <br/>
      The brass cylinders are fully insulated, except at the sample interface.
      <br/>
      During the test, which is in a transient state, the hot mass loses energy, raising the temperature of the cooler mass as the two masses approach an intermediate equilibrium temperature.
      <br/>
      Knowing that the brass masses are fully insulated, except for the heat transfer interface, and knowing the physical properties of the masses, the only unknown in the mathematical model describing the experiment is the thermal conductivity, k, of the paperboard sample, which enables its determination.

      This invention relates to an apparatus and method for determining paperboard thermal conductivity.
      <br/>
      Such structures of this type, generally, determine the thermal conductivity of a planar material, such as paperboard or insulating foams.
      <br/>
      The apparatus is designed to characterize the heat flow from a heated brass cylinder, through a flat paperboard sample, and into another brass cylinder.
      <br/>
      The brass cylinders are fully insulated, except at the sample interface.
      <br/>
      During the test, which is in a transient state, the hot mass loses energy, raising the temperature of the cooler mass as the two masses approach an intermediate equilibrium temperature.
      <br/>
      Knowing that the brass masses are fully insulated, except for the heat transfer interface, and knowing the physical properties of the masses, the only unknown in the mathematical model describing the experiment is the thermal conductivity, k, of the paperboard sample, which enables its determination.

    <p num="4">
      A number of devices are available, or have been reported, for the determination of thermal conductivity of planar materials.
      <br/>
      A device which takes two to three hours for a single test named the Fox 300 Heat Flo Meter was developed by Laser Corp.
      <br/>
      The cost to measure a single sample on that device is over $800 per sample.

      A method for determining the thermal conductivity and contact resistance of paper has been proposed, but this method requires a large size sample to be wrapped around a cylinder.
      <br/>
      Exemplary of such prior art is an article to R. J. Kerekes, entitled "A Simple Method for Determining the Thermal Conductivity and Contact Resistance of Paper," TAPPI Journal, Vol. 63, No. 9, September 1980, pp. 137-140. The size of samples under current consideration for the present invention are not adequate for this type of test.

      A planar and smaller version of such a test has been reported by Asensio and Seyed-Yagoobi.
      <br/>
      See, for example, M. C. Asensio et al., entitled "Thermal Contact Conductance of a Moist Paper Handsheet/Metal Interface for Paper Drying Application," Journal of Heat Transfer, Technical Notes, Vol. 115, November 1993, pp. 1051-1053 and J. K. Seyed-Yagoobi et al., entitled "Thermal Contact Conductance of a Bone-Dry Paper Handsheet/Metal Interface," Journal of Heat Transfer, Vol. 114, May 1992, pp. 326-330. This method, although adequate, has more of a focus on thermal contact resistance of paper on a metal interface for study of paper machine drying.
      <br/>
      Samples for this test must be cut to precise dimensions.
      <br/>
      This is not conducive to the current needs of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The test of a single sample on this apparatus has been reported to take up to eight hours to complete.

      Thermal conductivity of small paperboard samples has been determined using a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) device.
      <br/>
      Exemplary of such prior art is discussed by S. M. Marcus et al., entitled "Thermal Conductivity of Polymers, Glasses, and Ceramics by Modulated DSC," TA Instruments, Document TA-086.
      <br/>
      The sample size for these tests is approximately 1/4 in. diameter.
      <br/>
      Even with the small sample size, a single test can take hours to perform and the small scale can raise questions when the nonuniformity of paperboard is of the same order of magnitude.
      <br/>
      Also, this is a "modulated" frequently-domain test where the thermal conductivity is backed out from repeated heating/cooling cycles.
      <br/>
      The size of the sample is simply too small to be representative of a paperboard packager length scales of interest.

      There is an ASTM standard test for thermal conductivity and several experimental setups are described.

      This test falls into the category of a "steady state" device.
      <br/>
      It appears that the heat flux from one hot plate to another is the measured quantity and thermal conductivity is inferred from the experiment using Fourier's law.

      Terasaki also uses a steady state method in which the sample is wrapped around a small diameter heated copper tube.

      The low-temperature-differential system consists of transferring heat from the heated tube, through the wrapped sample, to a controlled air environment.

      The thermal conductivity of the sample is backed out from the experiment by way of the sample's thermal diffusivity,  ALPHA =k/( RHO C).

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">
      With reference first to FIG. 1, there is illustrated an advantageous environment for use of the concepts of this invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 illustrates thermal conductivity apparatus 2.
      <br/>
      Apparatus 2 includes, in part, paper sample 4, hot brass cylinder 6, unheated brass cylinder 8, conventional insulation 9, conventional Type K thermocouples 10 and 12, holes 11, conventional differential temperature meter 14, and conventional data logging computer processor 16.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Apparatus 2 has been designed to allow heat transfer from a heated brass cylinder 6, through a paperboard sample 4, to an unheated brass cylinder 8.
      <br/>
      Each brass cylinder 6 and 8 is insulated, except at the interface, where the paperboard sample 4 is placed.
      <br/>
      As time goes by, the hot cylinder 6 gets cooler and the unheated cylinder 8 gets hotter, and ultimately, both cylinders 6 and 8 reach the same temperature.
      <br/>
      The thermal conductivity of the paperboard sample can be determined by monitoring the time-dependent temperature difference between the two cylinders 6 and 8 coupled with a thermodynamic model of the system.
      <br/>
      Each brass cylinder 6 and 8 weighs about 31/4 lb, is almost 3 in. in diameter, and about 2 in. high.
      <br/>
      There are two small holes 11 conventionally drilled into the sides of each cylinder, each nominally 0.295 in. from the flat faces.
      <br/>
      A Type K thermocouple 10 and 12 is placed into the hole nearest the paperboard sample 4.
      <br/>
      A conventional Differential Temperature Meter 14 is used as a continuous analog output of the temperature difference between the two cylinders 6 and 8.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The hot cylinder 6 is heated to approximately 165 (degree)  F. Both the hot and unheated cylinders 6 and 8, respectively, are fitted into conventional insulation 9 designed to keep unaccounted-for heat transfer losses to a minimum, except at the paperboard interface.
      <br/>
      The paperboard sample 4 is sandwiched between the hot and cold cylinders 6 and 8, respectively, and a conventional portable computer processor 16 is used to log the temperature difference as the hot cylinder 6 cools and the ambient cylinder 8 gets warmer.
      <br/>
      The heat transfer process is logged for about 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A computer program was used for logging the transient experimental temperature difference data.
      <br/>
      See, for example, a copy of the computer program at end of this section.
      <br/>
      A conventional Data Translation DT2801 12-bit a/d card was used to digitize the analog signal.
      <br/>
      A voltage data reading was recorded every 5 seconds, but 20 a/d conversions were averaged to form up each data reading.
      <br/>
      The 20 conversions took only 59 msec to execute and this modification greatly improved the data stability compared to making only one a/d conversion at every time step.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The raw data is then analyzed for determination of thermal conductivity.
      <br/>
      Consider one-dimensional conduction heat transfer between a lumped energy capacity hot cylinder 6 at T1 across the heat transfer interface resistance Rth to an ambient cylinder 8 at T2 shown in the sketch below:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The process is time-dependent in T1 and T2 because no energy is added to the system, and the total energy of the system stays constant.
      <br/>
      Since the heat transfer depends on the temperature difference, q will also be a function of time.
      <br/>
      At any time, the energy in block 1 is E1 (t)= RHO 1 C1 V1 T1 and in block 2 the energy is E2 (t)= RHO 2 C2 V2 T2 where  RHO  is density, C is specific heat and V is volume.
      <br/>
      The two cylinders 6 and 8 are identical so the energy expressions can be simplified as E1 (t)= RHO CV T1 and E2 (t)= RHO CV T2.
      <br/>
      Since both blocks are insulated, total energy is conserved, and time-independent in Equation 1:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="25">The heat transfer leaving the hot block equals the heat transfer arriving at the cold block in Equation 2:  (Equation image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="26">
      Positive heat flow as shown in the sketch raises the energy of block 2.
      <br/>
      Consider that the initial conditions are known in Equation 3:
      <br/>
      T1 (t=0)=T10 and T2 (t=0)=T20  (Eq. 3)
    </p>
    <p num="27">Combine (Eq. 2) and (Eq. 3) and substitute expressions for E1 and q to get in Equation 4:  (Equation image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="28">
      Both T1 and T2 are functions of time.
      <br/>
      The total energy is constant at any time and equal to the initial total energy in Equation 5:
      <br/>
      Etotal = RHO CVT10 + RHO CVT20 = RHO CVT1 (t)+ RHO CVT2 (t)  (Eq. 5)
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Solving for T2 (t) in Equation 6:
      <br/>
      T2 (t)=T10 +T20 -T1(t)  (Eq. 6)
    </p>
    <p num="30">Substitute (Eq. 6) into (Eq. 4) to arrive at Equation 7:  (Equation image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="31">Now let  THETA =2 T1 -(T10 +T20) so that d THETA =2dT1 and substituting and separating (Eq. 7) gives Equation 8:  (Equation image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="32">Integrating (Eq. 8) from 0 to t gives Equation 9:  (Equation image '6' not included in text)</p>

    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The significance of this expression is that at any time during the transient experiment, a value for k is fully described by the current temperature difference, initial temperature difference, and lumped heat capacity properties.
      <br/>
      For a perfect experiment, and if k is independent of temperature, then an identical result for k will be obtained at each data-taking time step.
    </p>
    <p num="39">It is desired to extend the thermal conductivity modeling from analyzing a single data point each time to modeling the entire experiment and determining an effective thermal conductivity for the entire transient.</p>
    <p num="40">
      We wish to fit an exponential curve as shown in Equation 11:
      <br/>
      DELTA T=be-at,  (Eq. 11)
      <br/>
      where a and b are constants that result in the best fit of the experimental data.
      <br/>
      Take the natural log of both sides as shown in (Eq. 11):

      <br/>
      A linear least-squares fit can now be determined for the data set.

    <p num="43">
      The analytical approach to determine paperboard thermal conductivity depends on the hot mass or cylinder being at a uniform initial temperature, and both masses or cylinders being at a relatively uniform temperature throughout the transient process.
      <br/>
      Preliminary tests on the apparatus were made in order to verify these assumptions.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      It was determined that heating the hot mass on a Model 1900 Thermolyne hot plate set at 300 (degree)  F. for about 10 minutes would result in a good uniform temperature.
      <br/>
      To verify this, both thermocouples were placed in the small holes of a single brass mass as it was heated on the hot plate.
      <br/>
      Temperatures were recorded by hand throughout the heating at temperatures of 250, 300, 350, and 450 (degree)  F. The best heating to temperature was at the 300 (degree)  F. setting as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      At this setting, the hot block was uniform to within less than 1 (degree)  F. in 10 minutes as shown in FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Only the first 335 data points, or 28 minutes, from the raw data plotted in FIG. 4 was used for exponential curve fitting.
      <br/>
      The graphical fit for the 28 minute transient is shown in FIG. 5, and it is outstanding.
      <br/>
      Even the worst examples of curve-fitting for the first 6 samples were considered very good.

      TABLE 1, below, tabulates the raw data early in the transient and the thermal conductivity value determined from the exponential fit.

      For the 63 lb paperboard sample, thermal conductivity was determined to be 0.0384 Btu/hr ft (degree)  F. (0.0664 W/m (degree)  C.), which is equivalent to an R-value of 0.0477 hr ft2 (degree)  F./Btu for this 0.022 caliper sample.

      How does this compare to the indicated values of thermal conductivity for each data point? FIGS. 6 and 7 depict the instantaneous values of k and R-value for the transient.
      <br/>
      The result is satisfying since the majority of instantaneous thermal conductivity values are in the 0.065-0.070 W/m (degree)  C. range compared to the exponential-fit value of 0.0664 W/m (degree)  C. The same positive result is observed in the R-value comparison.
      <br/>
      The beauty of the exponential-fit approach is to wash out the noisy results of the instantaneous values and eliminate the need for arbitrary averaging.
