    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to a biologically active peptide; a novel pharmaceutical composition containing the peptide; a method for preparing the peptide; and, uses of the peptide.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Hormones are known to control the metabolic processes both in growing and mature organisms.
      <br/>
      Peptides often act as hormones.
      <br/>
      They are not only hormonally active themselves but regulate the action of other hormones, which control the vital activity of the organism.
      <br/>
      However, the potential of such natural compounds is limited.
      <br/>
      Therefore, many scientific laboratories have tried to develop methods for preparing synthetic derivatives of natural peptides, which are more active than their natural analogues (EP 0136720, 1984; EP 0137904, 1984).
      <br/>
      Moreover, new peptides have been synthesized, which are absent in the organism but have unique properties.
      <br/>
      Among them there is a special group of physiologically active peptides directly or indirectly controlling the action of hormones such as the growth hormone.
      <br/>
      Some of these active peptides increase the growth hormone level in blood (PCT 89/07111, 1989; PCT 91/16923, 1991) while others suppress the hormone (FR 2235701, 1978; FR 2532308, 1982).

    <p num="4">
      A peptide which activates the growth of the epidermal layer in man (PCT 90/13570, 1990), and a metal-containing peptide, which has a significant stimulating effect on hair growth in warm-blooded animals (PCT 91/07431, 1991) have been synthesized.
      <br/>
      Another peptide analogue has been reported to facilitate hair removal in animals (FR 2487677, 1982).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Different peptide compositions evidently make it possible to control metabolic processes.
      <br/>
      The most promising task is, however, the development of compounds and preparations with many-sided actions.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      At present, there are only a few peptides with comprehensive actions, for instance, the analogue of the P substance described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,283. The peptide synthesized as described in the patent has a range of useful properties.
      <br/>
      Its acts as a biostimulator, and has an analgesic effect similar to that of morphine.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Many studies have shown the importance of synthesizing peptides with opiate-like properties.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the production of morphine-like compounds from natural sources is limited by the complexity of the manufacturing processes (U.S. Pat. No. 4,042,682, 1977).
      <br/>
      This circumstance resulted in the creation of an arsenal of synthetic analogues (U.S. Pat. No. 4,681,871, 1987; EP 0112036, 1983; EP 0221019, 1986).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Some opiate-like peptides have become known and clinically used in the treatment of brain ischemia (DE 3447720, 1985; U.S. Pat. No. 4,684,624, 1987), for pain relief in pregnant women (EP 0099173, 1984), and only as analgesics.
      <br/>
      They are reported to be especially effective when used in combination with conventional drug therapy in many diseases (EP 096592, 1983; EP 0099286, 1984; U.S. Pat. No. 4,123,523, 1987).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      However, the known synthetic peptides cannot completely satisfy all medical requirements, since they do not have the necessary combination of properties, which would increase their effectiveness.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, many of them are effective only in large doses that can cause side effects.

      The invention further includes cyclic derivatives of the peptides of the invention.
      <br/>
      Cyclization allows the peptide to assume a more favourable conformation.
      <br/>
      Cyclization of the peptides may be achieved using techniques known in the art.
      <br/>
      In particular, disulfide bonds may be formed between two appropriately spaced components having free sulfhydryl groups.
      <br/>
      The bonds may be formed between side chains of amino acids, non-amino acid components, or a combination of the two.
    </p>
    <p num="28">The invention also includes a peptide of the invention conjugated with a selected protein, or a selectable marker (see below) to produce fusion proteins.</p>
    <p num="29">Peptides of the invention may be converted into pharmaceutical salts by reacting with inorganic acids including hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, etc., or organic acids including formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, benezenesulfonic acid, and toluenesulfonic acids.</p>
    <p num="30">
      The peptides of the invention may be prepared using recombinant techniques.
      <br/>
      Nucleic acid molecules which encode a peptide of the invention may be incorporated in a known manner into an expression vector which ensures good expression of the peptide.
      <br/>
      Suitable expression vectors include but are not limited to cosmids, plasmids, or modified viruses so long as the vector is compatible with the host cell used.
      <br/>
      The expression vectors contain a nucleic acid molecule encoding a peptide of the invention and regulatory sequences necessary for the transcription and translation of the inserted protein-sequence.
      <br/>
      Regulatory sequences may be obtained from a variety of sources, such as bacterial, fungal, viral, mammalian, or insect genes �See the regulatory sequences described in Goeddel, Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990)�. The selection of regulatory sequences is dependent on the host cell chosen, and may be readily accomplished by one of ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      Sequences, including an origin of replication, additional DNA restriction sites, enhancers, and sequences conferring inducibility of transcription may also be incorporated into the expression vector.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      A selectable marker gene which facilitates the selection of transformed or transfected host cells may also be included in the recombinant expression vector.
      <br/>
      Examples of selectable marker genes are genes encoding proteins such as G418 and hygromycin which confer resistance to certain drugs,  BETA -galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and firefly luciferase.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that the selectable markers may be introduced on a separate vector from the nucleic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Genes may also be included in the recombinant expression vectors which encode a fusion portion which provides increased expression of the recombinant peptide; increased solubility of the recombinant peptide; and/or aid in the purification of the recombinant peptide by acting as a ligand in affinity purification.
      <br/>
      In particular, a proteolytic cleavage site may be inserted to allow separation of the recombinant peptide from the fusion portion after purification of the fusion protein.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A recombinant expression vector may be introduced into a host cell to produce a transformant host cell.
      <br/>
      Transformant host cells include prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells transformed or transfected with a recombinant expression vector of the invention.
      <br/>
      The terms "transformed with", "transfected with", "transformation" and "transfection" include the introduction of nucleic acid (e.g. a vector) into a host cell by one of many techniques known in the art.
      <br/>
      Examples of methods for transforming and transfecting host cells may be found in Sambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory press (1989)), and other laboratory textbooks.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Suitable host cells include prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells.

      In particular, the peptides of the invention may be expressed in bacterial cells such as E. coli, insect cells (using baculovirus), yeast cells or mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      Other suitable host cells are described in Goeddel, Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1991).

    <p num="35">In the alternative, the peptides of the invention may be prepared by chemical synthesis using techniques known in the chemistry of proteins such as solid phase synthesis (Merrifield, 1964, J. Am. Chem. Assoc. 85:2149-2154) or synthesis in homogenous solution (Houbenweyl, 1987, Methods of Organic Chemistry, ed. E. Waunsch, Vol. 15 I and II, Thieme, Stuttgart).</p>
    <p num="36">
      According to an embodiment of the present invention, the peptide of the formula (I) is synthesized by step-by-step building of the peptide chain beginning with the C-terminal amino acid Z in the form of a substituted amide or an amino acid with a protected carboxyl group. N-protected phenylalanine is then attached using the method of activated esters or mixed anhydrides and the N-protecting group is removed.
      <br/>
      The next amino acid is attached using the method of activated esters or mixed anhydrides, and the N-protected group is then removed.
      <br/>
      The following N-protected amino acid is then added using the same procedure.
      <br/>
      When the chain building is completed, the tetra- or penta-peptide is deblocked, the peptide is obtained by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a palladium catalyst, and the final product is isolated.
      <br/>
      The peptide prepared using this process is a white powder with a yellowish or greyish tinge, soluble in water, substantially insoluble in alcohol, and substantially insoluble in chloroform.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      N-terminal or C-terminal fusion proteins comprising a peptide of the invention conjugated with other molecules such as proteins or selectable markers may be prepared by fusing, through recombinant techniques, the N-terminal or C-terminal of the peptide, and the sequence of a selected protein or selectable marker with a desired biological function.
      <br/>
      The resulting fusion proteins contain the peptide fused to the selected protein or marker protein as described herein.
      <br/>
      Fusion proteins may also be prepared using the step-by-step synthesis described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies specific for the peptides of the invention may be prepared using conventional methods.

      The peptides and pharmaceutical compositions containing the peptides have significant opiate-like effects and accordingly may be used as an analgesic, hypnotic, and diaphoric, and in spasmodic conditions.
      <br/>
      The peptides exhibit an anabolic effect: they increase body weight, stimulate the activity of the growth zone and growth of the epidermal layer, including hair.

      <br/>
      The peptides are administered in a therapeutically active amount.
      <br/>
      A therapeutically active amount is defined as an amount of the active ingredient i.e. peptides, effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired result.
      <br/>
      A therapeutically active amount of a peptide may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual.

    <p num="43">
      The peptides may be administered by injection (subcutaneous, intravenous, etc.), oral administration, inhalation, transdermal application, or rectal administration.
      <br/>
      Depending on the route of administration, the peptides in the pharmaceutical compositions may be coated in a material to protect them from the action of enzymes.
      <br/>
      Organic substances may also be included in the compositions to prolong the pharmacologic actions of the peptides.
      <br/>
      Examples of such organic substances include non-antigenic gelatin, carboxymethylcellulose, sulfonate or phosphate ester of alginic acid, dextran, polyethylene glycol and other glycols, phytic acid, polyglutamic acid, and protamine.

      Any pharmaceutically suitable diluent can be used in the composition for injections: distilled water, physiological or a salt solution, and/or a buffer solution.
      <br/>
      The composition for injections may be prepared by conventional volume-weight procedure.
      <br/>
      A certain amount of the peptide is diluted to the necessary volume with a diluent or solvent.

      The peptide proved to be non-toxic.
      <br/>
      The peptide toxicity (LD50) was studied in 24 white mice weighing 18 g. The animals received the same diet and were kept in the same conditions.
      <br/>
      Half of the animals in each group were male mice and the other half were female mice.
      <br/>
      Twenty-four hours before the experiment and during it, the animals were housed in a vivarium with a constant temperature and ventilation.
      <br/>
      Two hours before the experiment the animals were deprived of water and food.
      <br/>
      The animals were divided into four groups, 6 mice each.
      <br/>
      Mice of groups 1, 2 and 3 were injected intraperitoneally with 0.2 ml of water solution of the peptide in the dose of 800, 1100 and 1400 mg/kg, respectively.
      <br/>
      Control animals (group 4) were injected with the same volume of physiological solution.
      <br/>
      The observation period lasted 7 days after the injections, then LD50 was calculated.
      <br/>
      No changes were observed in the animals' general state or behaviour both immediately after injections and throughout the observation period.
      <br/>
      The peptide injections did not cause pain syndromes.
      <br/>
      No animals died in the period.
      <br/>
      The animals had normal weight gains, weight factors of the organs varied within the physiological norm.
    </p>
    <p num="96">The results of the study showed that intraperitoneal injections of the peptide in the doses of 800, 1100 and 1400 mg/kg did not cause any toxic effect and even high doses of the peptide were well tolerated by the animals.</p>

    <p num="99">
      The "tail flick" method was used to test the analgesic activity of a number of peptides administered intranasally, in a dose of 0.005 mg per kg body weight.

      The titer growth shows that the peptide considerably improved the organism reactivity and the fish became more resistant to protozoan and bacterial infections.
      <br/>
      As well, lysozyme activity was reduced by nearly 20%.
