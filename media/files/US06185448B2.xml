    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for locating an electrode position, and more particularly, is directed to an apparatus and method for locating and mapping a catheter for use in intracardiac applications such as cardiac arrhythmia, ventricular tachycardia and other heart disorders.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Cardiac arrhythmia, which is an irregular heartbeat, is the leading cause of death in the United States.
      <br/>
      For example, ventricular tachycardia (VT), which is an excessively fast heartbeat, that is, a very rapid contraction of the heart muscle, is the cause death of about 300,000 patients annually.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is necessary to detect defects in the heart rhythm, and locate the position of the these defects.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Generally, with regard to the heart pulses, there is an electrical signal that travels down the inner walls of the heart, contracting the heart from the top to the bottom in much like a squeezing action.
      <br/>
      As the electrical signal passes vertically along the inner walls of the heart to produce the contraction, the heart then expands again.
      <br/>
      At the end of the signal, that is, at the bottom of the heart, the signal has ended and a new signal starts at the top of the heart to again begin contraction.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      However, oftentimes, there are dead or defective tissue or small lesions on the inner walls of the heart.
      <br/>
      In such case, the small lesions disturb the conduction of the electrical pulse.
      <br/>
      This results in delay of the pulse to reach the bottom of the heart and to be entirely canceled out.
      <br/>
      As a result, an extra pulse is produced which causes the heart to pre-contract again before it should, resulting in a double pulse, or double contraction, causing ventricular tachycardia (VT) or an excessively fast heartbeat.
      <br/>
      Since a full heart pump is not produced for each pulse, this causes problems in getting the necessary blood flow to all parts of the body.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In order to cure this problem, the defective tissue or small lesions of the heart wall are burned out or ablated.
      <br/>
      As a result, the burned out areas are bypassed by the electrical signal that travels down the heart wall, so that no double pulse or double contraction is produced, and a regular heartbeat is achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In order to detect this defective tissue of the heart, catheters are conventionally inserted through main blood vessels into the inside of the heart.
      <br/>
      The catheters have spaced metal contacts on the outside thereof which touch the inner wall of the heart at different locations.
      <br/>
      When the catheter touches the inner wall of the heart, it detects the signals which stimulate the contraction and which run along the heart.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, stimulus signals can be supplied to the heart, and be detected by the catheter electrodes.
      <br/>
      A plurality of such catheters can be provided for such measurement in the heart at one time.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Conventionally, however, this process has proved to be time-consuming, and burdensome with difficulties to locate the electrode position in relation to the heart interior.
      <br/>
      The procedure for locating the defective tissues utilizes electro-physiology examination that provides mapping by electrical activity of the heart.
      <br/>
      Specifically, this procedure requires constant movement of the sensing electrodes, combined with x-ray illumination needed for gathering positioning reference points.
      <br/>
      Such procedure is tedious, time-consuming, and requires constant use of x-ray illumination for imaging and mapping, exposing the patient and physician to high doses of harmful radiation.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Further, locating the position of a catheter inserted into body organs, and in particular, sensitive organs such as the heart, is considered a difficult procedure.
      <br/>
      The only effective method today is the use of x-ray illumination, as discussed above.
      <br/>
      However, the x-ray illuminations usually result in poor or fuzzy imaging due to the fact that x-ray does not produce good image of soft tissue in comparison to hard tissue such as bones.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this procedure results in a poor image of the heart anatomy.
      <br/>
      In intracardiac mapping applications where accurate positioning of the inserted electrode is important, x-rays therefore do not provide absolute positioning in respect to the heart interior walls.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      After mapping the position of the defective tissue or small lesions of the heart, a separate ablation catheter is inserted into the heart and includes a heating element to burn out the defective tissue.
      <br/>
      Because it is impossible with the use of x-rays to determine the exact location of the defective tissue, the ablation catheter is used to burn out an area which is much larger than each area of defective tissue, in order to ensure that all of the defective tissue is burned out.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      This procedure causes problems, because there are key nerves lining the heart, and it is not known from the mere use of the above sensing electrodes if one of the key nerves is being burned out.
      <br/>
      If it is burned out, the patient may thereafter require a pacemaker.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Thus, with this prior procedure using x-rays, there is no way to determine the exact location of the sensing electrodes or catheters, and there is no way to document previous positions of the catheters.
      <br/>
      Further, this procedure is long and tedious, and subjects the patient to long use of x-rays, as discussed above.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="39">
      Referring to the drawings in detail, an apparatus 10 for locating and mapping a catheter 12 for use in intracardiac applications such as cardiac arrhythmia, ventricular tachycardia and other heart disorders, includes a U-shaped support 14 having first and second legs 14a and 14b that are connected at lower ends thereof by a connecting leg 14c.
      <br/>
      Connecting leg 14c includes a hinge 16 at its center so that the free ends of legs 14a and 14b can be moved away from each other to permit a patient to enter therebetween and toward each other so that the free ends are in contact, or substantially in contact, with opposite sides of the patient at the level of the patient's heart H, as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The use of hinge 16 thereby allows use of the apparatus on different body sizes, and to compensate for mechanical changes in chest volume while the patient is breathing.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      A motor 18 is mounted to the free end of each leg 14a and 14b.
      <br/>
      Preferably, each motor 18 is a stepper motor whereby the position and speed of the motor can be controlled.
      <br/>
      Motor 18 is only shown schematically by its motor housing in FIGS. 1 and 2, although the actual housing 20 preferably takes the shape shown in FIG. 3A. In FIG. 3A, a circular front plate 22 covers the front opening of housing 20 and is mounted to the end of the motor shaft 24.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, front plate 22 rotates with motor shaft 24.
      <br/>
      A permanent magnet 26N or 26S is mounted at the periphery of each front plate 22 and is made from a ferrous magnetic material.
      <br/>
      Specifically, magnet 26N mounted to front plate 22 associated with leg 14a has a north pole face, while magnet 26S mounted to front plate 22 associated with leg 14b has a south pole face.
      <br/>
      As a result, a directional magnetic field is created between magnets 26N and 26S.
      <br/>
      Front plates 22 rotate in synchronism with each other and such that magnets 26N and 26S are always facing each other.
      <br/>
      As a result, a horizontal revolving magnetic field or flux M is generated through the patient at heart level, that is, across the heart.
      <br/>
      Motor shaft 24 can rotate at any suitable speed, such as up to 1,000 rpm.
      <br/>
      It is further noted that U-shaped support 14 is also made of a ferrous magnetic material so as to maintain the closed magnetic loop created by the revolving magnets 26N and 26S.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      As shown in FIG. 4, motors 18 are controlled by a motor drive and position control circuit 30 that supplies appropriate control signals for each motor 18 through an amplifier 32 and motor drive coil 34 in order to control the speed and angular position of motor shaft 24, and thereby of magnets 26N and 26S.
      <br/>
      A power supply 36 supplies power to motors 18 and motor drive and position control circuit 30 for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      An angular position and speed indicator is provided with each leg 14a and 14b.
      <br/>
      Specifically, each front plate 22 is provided with a plurality of position indicators 38 on the inner surface thereof, and an indicator detection unit 40 is mounted to each housing 20 at the open end thereof that is covered by the front plate 22.
      <br/>
      As a result, detection unit 40 detects each time that a position indicator 38 revolves therepast, and thereby provides an indication as to the speed and angular position of magnets 26N and 26S.
      <br/>
      Position indicators 38 and detection unit 40 can be any conventional devices, such as a photodetector for detection unit 40 and markings for position indicators 38, or any other suitable device.
    </p>
    <p num="43">The outputs from detection units 40 are supplied through amplifiers 42 to a central processing unit (CPU) 44, which analyzes the signals and determines the position and angular speed of front plate 22, and then sends appropriate correction signals to motor drive and position control circuit 30 in order to control the speed and angular position of magnets 26N and 26S.</p>
    <p num="44">
      According to the present invention, catheter 12 is inserted through blood vessels into heart H in order to detect defective tissue or lesions of the heart, and then to ablate the same.
      <br/>
      Thus, the magnetic field M is used to accurately detect the position of catheter 12 at all times and to use the coordinates of catheter 12 to provide an accurate and reliable three-dimensional plot of inner heart H for purposes of ablation.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      As shown in FIG. 5, catheter 12 is made from a flexible tubular material, as is well known, and includes spaced metal ring ECG sensing electrodes 46 on the outside wall thereof which are individually and independently sensing the timed progression of the electrical signal along the heart wall.
      <br/>
      When ECG sensing electrodes 46 touch the inner wall of heart H at different locations, they detect the signals which stimulate the contraction of heart H and which run along the inner wall of heart H. Alternatively, stimulus signals can be supplied to heart H, and be detected by electrodes 46 of catheter 12.
      <br/>
      Further, a plurality of such catheters 12 can be provided at the same time in heart H for such measurement.
      <br/>
      The signals are received by an ECG signal conditioning unit 48 which, in turn, supplies the signals to CPU 44 for display.
      <br/>
      Based on this analysis, CPU 44 provides an indication in any suitable format on a monitor 50 of the measure of the electrical activity of heart H.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In addition, catheter 12 includes two spaced apart solid state Hall effect magnetic sensor groups 52 and 54.
      <br/>
      Magnetic sensor group 52 is located at the distal tip of catheter 12 to one side of sensing electrodes 46, while the other magnetic sensor group 54 is located at the other proximal side of sensing electrodes 46.
      <br/>
      Each sensor group 52 and 54 includes an X-axis or horizontal sensor 56 which senses a magnetic flux in an X-direction 57, a Y-axis or vertical sensor 58 which senses a magnetic flux in a Y-direction 59 and a Z-axis or depth sensor 60 which senses a magnetic flux in a Z-direction 61.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Preferably, each sensor 56, 58 and 60 is a solid state Hall effect magnetic sensor, which indicates changes in the electrical current of the sensor when approaching a magnetic field.
      <br/>
      An example of such a suitable three axis Hall effect sensor is one sold by F.W. Bell of Orlando, Fla. under Model No. BH-703. Similarly, the magnetic sensors can be of the type of giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors, for example, of the type sold by NVE, Nonvolatile Electronics, Inc. of Eden Prairie, Minnesota, or a resistive magnetic sensor.
      <br/>
      Such sensors can be produced in small size housings, as small as 0.05 inch by 0.05 inch substrates, which are sufficiently small to be implemented inside an intracardiac catheter.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Further, solid state sensors can pin-point a direction much better than with a coil.
      <br/>
      This is because of the sensing element which is very directive or linear.
      <br/>
      Also, solid state sensors can detect a stationary magnetic field, whereas inductors can only detect an alternating magnetic field.
      <br/>
      Thus, with the present invention, the magnets can be rotated in an incremental or stepped manner and then stopped for the purpose of taking a more prolonged measurement, for better resolution.
      <br/>
      All conventional systems use coils for creating a magnetic field and for measuring the intensity of the magnetic field.
      <br/>
      However, this suffers from the disadvantages discussed above.
      <br/>
      Further, the use of coils requires a much higher current, and it is difficult to reduce the size and place the coils in a catheter.
    </p>
    <p num="49">Electrical leads inside the tubing 12a of catheter 12, supply the necessary current to drive the sensors, which in turn, send electrical signals that are relative to the magnetic field strength and direction.</p>
    <p num="50">
      When catheter 12 is manipulated inside heart H, catheter 12 moves within the revolving magnetic flux area of magnetic field M. The closer a sensor is to the direct line between magnets 26N and 26S, the stronger the signal.
      <br/>
      Further, if a sensor is directed directly toward the line between magnets 26N and 26S, there is a stronger signal than if the sensor is turned away from this direct line.
      <br/>
      This will also indicate the orientation of catheter 12, depending upon whether an X-axis, Y-axis or Z-axis sensor produces a stronger signal.
      <br/>
      Thus, by providing two sensor groups 52 and 54, each with three orthogonal magnetic sensors 56, 58 and 60, CPU 44 can analyze and calculate the relative X, Y and Z orientation of catheter 12 with respect to main magnetic field M, even if catheter 12 becomes twisted or turned around.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The signals from sensor groups 52 and 54 are supplied to an electrode location circuit 62 which conditions the signals and supplies the conditioned signals to CPU 44.
      <br/>
      In response to the signals supplied from electrode location circuit 62 to CPU 44, and the signals supplied to CPU 44 from indicator detection units 40 as to the angular position and speed of magnets 26N and 26S, CPU 44 determines the coordinates and orientation of catheter 12 and supplies signals to monitor 50 to indicate this position and orientation of catheter 12.
      <br/>
      The beam positioning created by magnets 26N and 26S relative to magnetic sensor groups 52 and 54 allows CPU 44 to distinguish the proportional location of catheter 12 relative to the anatomy of heart H.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      This is important for providing an indication as to the electrical signals traveling along the inner walls of heart H from electrodes 46.
      <br/>
      Because it is possible to determine the exact location of the defective tissue, ablation can occur with respect to accurately defined areas, so that only those areas of heart H which are necessary to be ablated are burned out, that is, avoiding burning out an area which is much larger than each area of defective tissue, as in the prior art.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In addition, CPU 44 stores each of these signals in a memory, such as a random access memory (RAM) 64, and can retrieve all of the signals to create a three-dimensional model of heart M on monitor 50 prior to ablation.
      <br/>
      By accurately mapping a three-dimensional image of heart H, the location of key nerves in heart H can be determined by the known location of such nerves in a conventional heart, so as to avoid burning out these key nerves.
      <br/>
      In other words, if a surgeon has a three-dimensional model of heart H from the sensors, the surgeon knows where the key nerves would normally occur on a heart and knows to stay away from these areas during the ablation operation.
      <br/>
      In addition, the three-dimensional mapping provides a pin-point location for the ablation.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      As shown in FIG. 4, electrode location circuit 62 includes three input amplifiers 66X, 66Y and 66Z for amplifying the X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis signals from magnetic sensors 56, 58 and 60 of magnetic sensor groups 52 and 54.
      <br/>
      The input signals from sensor group 52 can be input in a time displaced manner from the input signals from sensor group 54, or can be coded differently, in order to distinguish the signals.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a separate electrode location circuit can be used for each sensor group 52 and 54.
      <br/>
      The output from each amplifier 66X, 66Y and 66Z is then supplied through band pass filters 68X, 68Y and 68Z, respectively, which condition the signals, and then through amplifiers 70X, 70Y and 70Z, respectively, to CPU 44.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      It will be appreciated that the resolution of information regarding the position of catheter 12, as determined by the signals from magnetic sensors 56, 58 and 60, will be determined by the number of times during a single 360 degree revolution of magnets 26N and 26S that readings are taken.
      <br/>
      For example, a higher resolution is obtained if a reading is taken ever one degree, rather than every 10 degrees of revolution of magnetic field M.
    </p>
    <p num="56">A separate ablation catheter that also has the same magnetic sensor configuration built at its distal tip can be easily manipulated in the heart and be navigated to the ablation area based on traveling coordinates acquired from the magnetic sensing catheter.</p>
    <p num="57">
      Alternatively, the same catheter 12 can be provided with an ablation tip or heating element 72 at the distal end thereof.
      <br/>
      This is different from conventional applications in which multiple electrodes or catheters are provided for each application, that is, ECG monitoring and ablation.
      <br/>
      Thus, in this embodiment, the present invention provides an all-inclusive solution by providing ablation tip 72 on the same catheter as that used for ECG monitoring.
      <br/>
      Ablation tip 72 is connected to an RF ablation generator that provides the necessary energy to burn the defective tissue (ablation) on the heart wall.
      <br/>
      In this regard, magnetic sensor groups 52 and 54 provide the signals to CPU 44 for correctly locating catheter 12 in the ablation step.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Thus, upon insertion of catheter 12 into heart H, as shown in FIG. 1, apparatus 10 is activated.
      <br/>
      Some x-ray fluoroscopy may be used at the beginning of the operation in order to correctly position catheter 12 in heart H, and to mark a few basic reference points, but is not used thereafter.
      <br/>
      At this stage, permanent magnets 26N and 26S start to revolve by means of motors 18 at a steady and synchronized speed, and in alignment with each other.
      <br/>
      As a result, a directive revolving magnetic beam is created, which travels 360 degrees around a circle in relation to heart H, creating a cylindrical cage of magnetic beams that cross the heart in a 360 degree circle.
      <br/>
      Magnetic sensors 56, 58 and 60 of magnetic sensor groups 52 and 54 detect the magnetic field, and based on the position of the magnetic field, that is, the position of magnets 26N and 26S, and the strength of the magnetic field detected by each sensor, the position of catheter 12 can easily be determined.
      <br/>
      In this manner, an accurate three-dimensional model of heart H can be obtained, with accurate measurements of the electrical activity of heart H.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Then, after the three-dimensional model and the electrical activity of heart H have been determined, ablation occurs by either the same catheter 12 with ablation tip 72 or by a separate ablation catheter, which uses the same revolving magnetic field and the same magnetic sensors 56, 58 and 60 to accurately position catheter 12, and more particularly, ablation tip 72 thereof, at the correct pin-point location (defective tissue areas) for ablation.
      <br/>
      Further, only that area that needs to be burned out is ablated, thereby minimizing ablation damage to the surrounding tissues, in contrast to the prior art.
    </p>
    <p num="60">The above operation occurs without using extensive x-ray fluoroscopy, thereby limiting x-ray radiation exposure to the physician and patient.</p>
    <p num="61">It will be appreciated that, while the present invention has been discussed relative to an intracardiac operation, apparatus 10 can be used with any other bodily organ.</p>
    <p num="62">Having described a specific preferred embodiment of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to that precise embodiment, and that various changes and modifications can be effected therein by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
