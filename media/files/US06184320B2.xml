    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to metallocene compounds in which a transition metal is complexed by two anionic cyclopentadienyl ligands (carbanions) and the two carbanions are connected to one another by at least one bridge comprising a donor and an acceptor.
      <br/>
      The coordinative bond formed between the donor atom and the acceptor atom generates a positive (partial) charge on the donor group and a negative (partial) charge on the acceptor group:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="2">The invention further relates to a process for preparing such new metallocene compounds and to their use as polymerization catalysts.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Metallocenes and their use as catalysts in the polymerization of olefins have been known for a long time (EP-A 129 368 and the literature cited therein).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, EP-A '368 discloses that metallocenes in combination with aluminum alkyl/water as cocatalysts are effective systems for the polymerization of ethylene. (Thus, for example, 1 mol of trimethylaluminum and 1 mol of water form methylaluminoxane=MAO.
      <br/>
      Other stoichiometric ratios have also been successfully employed (WO 94/20506).) Metallocenes whose cyclopentadienyl frameworks are covalently linked to one another by a bridge are also already known.
      <br/>
      As an example of the numerous patents and applications in this field, mention may be made of EP-A 704 461 in which the linking group mentioned is a (substituted) methylene or ethylene group, a silylene group, a substituted silylene group, a substituted germylene group or a substituted phosphine group.
      <br/>
      In EP '461 too, the bridged metallocenes are envisaged as polymerization catalysts for olefins.
      <br/>
      Despite the numerous patents and applications in this field, there is still a desire for improved catalysts which have a high activity so that the amount of catalyst remaining in the polymer can be made small and which are equally suitable for the polymerization and copolymerization of olefins to give thermoplastics and to give elastomeric products and for the polymerization and copolymerization of diolefins, if desired together with olefins.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      It has now been found that particularly advantageous catalysts can be prepared from bridged metallocene compounds in which the bridge between the two cyclopentadienyl-containing ligands is produced by one, two or three donor-acceptor bonds in each of which a coordinative or dative bond which is, at least formally, superimposed on an ionic bond is formed between the donor atom and the acceptor atom.
      <br/>
      The reversibility of the donor-acceptor bond permits not only the bridged state denoted by the arrow between D and A but also the unbridged state in which the two x systems can rotate relative to one another, for example by 360 (degree) , as a result of their intrinsic rotational energy without the integrity of the metal complex being surrendered.
      <br/>
      After rotation has occurred, the donor-acceptor bond "snaps" back into place.
      <br/>
      If a plurality of donors and/or acceptors are present, such "snapping into place" can take place after rotation through less than 360 (degree) . Metallocenes of the invention can therefore only be represented by a double arrow and the subformulae (Ia) and (lb) to encompass both states.

      The first and second carbanions CpI and CpII containing a cyclopentadienyl framework can be identical or different.

      The cyclopentadienyl framework can be, for example, one selected from the group consisting of cyclopentadiene, substituted cyclopentadiene, indene, substituted indene, fluorene and substituted fluorene.
      <br/>
      There may be from 1 to 4 substituents per cyclopentadiene or fused-on benzene ring.

      These substituents can be C1 -C20 -alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl or isobutyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl, dodecyl, hexadecyl, octadecyl or eicosyl, C1 -C20 -alkoxy such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy or isobutoxy, hexoxy, octyloxy, decyloxy, dodecyloxy, hexadecyloxy, octadecyloxy or eicosyloxy, halogen such as fluorine, chlorine or bromine, C6 -C12 -aryl such as phenyl, C1 -C4 -alkylphenyl such as tolyl, ethylphenyl, (i-)propylphenyl, (i-, tert-)butylphenyl or xylyl, halophenyl such as fluorophenyl, chlorophenyl or bromophenyl, naphthyl or biphenylyl, triorganosilyl such as trimethylsilyl (TMS), ferrocenyl and also D or A as defined above.
      <br/>
      Fused-on aromatic rings can also be partially or fully hydrogenated so that there remains only the double bond which is shared by both the fused-on ring and the cyclopentadiene ring.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, benzene rings as in indene or fluorene can have one or two further fused-on benzene rings.
      <br/>
      In addition, the cyclopentadiene or cyclopentadienyl ring and a fused-on benzene ring can together have a further fused-on benzene ring.
      <br/>
      Such cyclopentadiene frameworks are, in the form of their anions, excellent ligands for transition metals where each cyclopentadienyl carbanion of said substituted or unsubstituted form balancing one positive charge of the central metal in the complex.

      Specific examples of such carbanions are: cyclopentadienyl, methyl-cyclopentadienyl, 1,2-dimethyl-cyclopentadienyl, 1,3-dimethyl-cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, phenylindenyl, 1,2-diethyl-cyclopentadienyl, tetramethyl-cyclopentadienyl, ethyl-cyclopentadienyl, n-butyl-cyclopentadienyl, n-octyl-cyclopentadienyl, P-phenylpropyl-cyclopentadienyl, tetrahydroindenyl, propyl-cyclopentadienyl, t-butyl-cyclopentadienyl, benzyl-cyclopentadienyl, diphenylmethyl-cyclopentadienyl, trimethylgermyl-cyclopentadienyl, trimethylstannyl-cyclopentadienyl, trifluoromethyl-cyclopentadienyl, trimethylsilyl-cyclopentadienyl, pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl, fluorenyl, tetrahydro- or octahydro-fluorenyl, fluorenyls and indenyls which are benzo-fused on the six-membered ring, N,N-dimethylamino-cyclopentadienyl, dimethylphosphino-cyclopentadienyl, methoxy-cyclopentadienyl, dimethylboranyl-cyclopentadienyl, (N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)-cyclopentadienyl.

      <br/>
      For the case of a plurality of D or A, these can take up various positions among those mentioned.
      <br/>
      The invention accordingly encompasses both the bridged molecular states (Ia) and the unbridged states (Ib).
      <br/>
      The number of D groups can be identical or different to the number of A groups.

      <br/>
      Changing between a closed and open D/A bond makes possible sequence polymers having higher and lower stereoregularity.

      Suitable donor groups are, in particular, those in which the donor atom D is an element of main group V, VI or VII of the Periodic Table of the Elements (Mendeleev) and has at least one free electron pair and where, in the case of elements of main group V, the donoratom is present in a bonding state with substituents and in the case of elements of main group VI may be in such a state; donor atoms of main group VII bear no substituents.
      <br/>
      This is illustrated as follows for the example of phosphorus P, oxygen O and chlorine Cl as donor atoms, where "Subst." represents such substituents mentioned and "-Cp" represents the bond to the cyclopentadienyl-containing carbanion, a line with an arrow is a coordinative bond as defined in formula (I) and other lines represent electron pairs present:  (Chemical Structure image '13' not included in text)

      As a result of the donor-acceptor bridge, the metallocene compounds of the invention make it possible for the two cyclopentadienyl frameworks to open to a defined extent like a beak, ensuring not only a high activity but also a high stereoselectivity, a controlled molecular weight distribution and a uniform incorporation of comonomers.
      <br/>
      A defined beak-like opening also makes room for bulky comonomers.

      The D/A structure can effect extra stabilization of the catalysts up to high temperatures so that the catalysts can also be used in the high-temperature range from 80 to 250 (degree)  C., preferably from 80 to 180 (degree)  C. The possible thermal dissociation of the donor-acceptor bond is reversible and, by means of this self-organization process and self-repairing mechanism, leads to particularly high-value catalyst properties.
      <br/>
      The thermal dissociation makes possible, for example, a targeted broadening of the molecular weight distribution, giving the polymers better processibility.
      <br/>
      This effect also occurs, for example, in the case of those catalysts in which CpI and CpII are linked by both a covalent and a D/A bridge.

      The D/A metallocene structures of the invention make possible, for example, a degree of defect-free polyethylene formation which is not achieved using classical catalysts.

      Correspondingly, the ethene polymers can have extraordinarily high melting points, for example above 135 (degree)  C-160 (degree)  C. (maximum in the DSC curve).
      <br/>
      Such linear polyethylenes which are obtained directly in the polymerization process and have melting points of from 140 to 160 (degree)  C. (maxima in the DSC curves), preferably from 142 to 160 (degree)  C., particularly preferably from 144 to 160 (degree)  C., are new. Such new high-melting polyethylenes display, for example, improved mechanical properties and heat distortion resistance (sterilizability in medical applications) compared with the known polyethylenes and thereby open up possible applications which have hitherto not appeared possible for polyethylene and, for example, whose requirements could hitherto only be met by high-tacticity polypropylene.
      <br/>
      Further features are high enthalpies of fusion and high PE molar masses.
    </p>
    <p num="73">Although the polymerization temperature increase lowers the PE molar mass in a wide temperature range, this occurs without appreciable decrease in activity and without going outside the overall range of industrially important high PE molar masses and high PE melting points.</p>

      Furthermore, it has been observed that metallocene compounds of the invention having a suitable symmetry effect a regiospecific (isotactic, syndiotactic) polymerization of suitable monomers, but in the upper part of the temperature range mentioned trigger an increasingly nonspecific (atactic) linking of the monomer units of the same monomer.
      <br/>
      This phenomenon has not yet been fully studied, but could be in agreement with the observation that coordinative bonds which have an ionic bond superimposed on them, like the donor-acceptor bonds in the metallocene compounds of the invention, display increasing reversibility at higher temperature.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, in the ethylene-propylene copolymerization it has been observed that for the same supply of the two comonomers, a copolymer having a high propylene contact is formed at a low polymerization temperature while the propylene content decreases with increasing polymerization temperature until finally polymers containing predominantly ethylene are formed at high temperature.

      Such self-activation can be intramolecular or intermolecular.
