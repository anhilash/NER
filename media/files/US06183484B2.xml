      <br/>
      The suture ligating device includes a manipulation portion, first and second rod members provided at the manipulation portion and making a relative movement in response to an operation of the manipulation portion, first and second top end members provided at an end of the first rod member, concaves formed at the ends of the first and second top end members, and the third top end member provided at an end of the second rod member to perform an open and close movement in response to the relative movement of the first and second rod members.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention generally relates to a suture technology for ligating tissues at a small area within a human body to be used in performing endoscopic surgery, and more particularly, to a suture ligating device for sending a knot of a suture formed outside the human body to an intended location in the human body to ligate the tissues therein.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Recently, surgery using an endoscope (endoscopic surgery) is getting more widely performed.
      <br/>
      While the conventional surgery methods need to largely dissect the abdomen or chest of a human body for cutting, suturing or ligating the tissues to be treated, an endoscopic surgery only needs to cut a hole of a minimum size in the abdomen or other regions.
      <br/>
      Due to the smallness of the cut, early recovery of the patient is possible.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Endoscopic surgery is performed as follows.
      <br/>
      First, a trocar having a reverse stop valve is inserted into the hole cut in an abdomen.
      <br/>
      A gas is charged therethrough into the abdominal cavity to create a space at the surgery region.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, surgery is performed by inserting scalpels, forceps and the like in the abdominal cavity through the hollow space of the trocar.
      <br/>
      In order to monitor the surgery, another hole is created in the abdomen to insert another trocar to provide a monitoring camera therein for monitoring the operation of the surgery.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Since the space of the abdominal cavity is limited, surgeons must insert slender devices in a narrow space by monitoring the display to perform the surgery appropriately.
      <br/>
      Depending on the circumstances, surgeons must suture the tissue of the dissected portion or ligate a number of blood vessels.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The above suturing procedure is performed as follows.
      <br/>
      A guide device for guiding a needle having a suture, formed for example in a forceps shape, such as a guide device disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 9-56719, is inserted through the space in the trocar.
      <br/>
      Then, the tissues to be sutured are grasped and pierced by the needle having a suture.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, both ends of the piercing suture is pulled back outside the human body through the space of the trocar.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, a tie or knot (hereinafter referred to as a "knot") of the suture is formed outside the human body.
      <br/>
      This knot is then sent back to the place where the tissues are ligated by using a suture sending device called a "knot pusher", an example of which is disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 5-317321. Then, the tissues are ligated at that place.
      <br/>
      By repeating this operation more than two times, a ligation which will not get loose, such as called a "surgeon's knot", can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      However, at the time the knot is sent to the inner cavity with use of the knot pusher through the space of the trocar, the movement of the knot pusher is hindered by the reverse stop valves as well as the narrow space of the tube of the trocar, hitting many spots inside the trocar.
      <br/>
      Owing to this problem, the knot of the suture is sometimes separated from the knot pusher.
      <br/>
      If the knot has already passed the trocar and is reached the space of the abdominal cavity, it is still possible to recapture the knot by the knot pusher through monitoring the knot by the camera display.
      <br/>
      However, such an operation for recapturing the knot takes a long time.
      <br/>
      If the knot is separated from the knot pusher inside the trocar, it is extremely difficult to recapture the knot.
      <br/>
      Thus, the knot pressing operating has to start over again, taking a much longer time.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In addition, as described above, since the number of the knots to be tied for each tissue ligating is at least two, possibility of occurrence of the above trouble exists at least two times at one place.
      <br/>
      This results in a heavy burden to surgeons as well as patient.
      <br/>
      Further, the knot ligated by the first operation sometimes becomes loose before the second knot is sent thereto, resulting in the failure of sufficiently joining the tissues.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a suture ligating device which can reliably send a knot or knots of the suture tied outside the human body to the tissues to be ligated inside the human body without causing a separation of the knot from the device.</p>
    <p num="9">It is another object of the present invention to provide a suture ligating device which can transfer two knots at the same time to the tissues to be ligated inside the human body and tighten the knots.</p>
    <p num="10">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a suture ligating device which can smoothly transfer one or more knots formed outside of the human body to the tissues to be ligated inside the human body without causing friction between the suture and the ligating device.</p>
    <p num="11">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a suture ligating device which can securely transfer one or more knots to the tissues to be ligated by forming a closed space in which at least one knot is confined.</p>
    <p num="12">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a suture ligating device which can easily tighten the knots for the tissues to be ligated by widening a top end portion of the suture ligating device.</p>
    <p num="13">The above object of the present invention is achieved by providing a suture ligating device which includes a manipulation portion, a first and second rod members for making a relative movement to each other by an operation of the manipulation portion, first and second top end members provided at the top ends of the first and second rod members, and a third top end member connected to the second rod member for entering in a space provided between the first and second top end members in accordance with the relative movement of the first and second rod members, wherein the first and second top end members are provided with concaves opening in the top end direction, each of the concaves is separated from, each other by a predetermined distance, and the third top end member enters into a position located at the top end side over a bottom of the concaves of the first and second top end members.</p>
    <p num="14">
      The first and second rod members of the above device are provided in parallel and the relative movement of these members are made in the longitudinal direction of these slender members.
      <br/>
      At the time the third top end member enters into the space between the first and second top end members, the top end of the protrusions forming the concavity of the first and second top end members may protrude beyond the third top end member so that the second concavity is formed by the third top end member and the protrusions of the first and second top end members.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In a further aspect of the present invention, the third top end member may be provided with a projection at its top end side such that the projection and a protrusion of the first and second top end member protruding beyond the third top end member may form the second concavity.
      <br/>
      Further, the top end face of the third top end member may be formed in a concave shape so that the knot of the suture placed in the second concavity is prevented from directly contacting with the top end face of the third top end member.
      <br/>
      Further, a part of the first and the second top end members may be integrally connected by a connecting member.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In a further aspect of the present invention, the suture ligating device is structured so that all of first, second and third top end members perform open and close movement in response to an operation of a manipulation portion of the suture ligating device.
      <br/>
      The suture ligating device includes a manipulation portion, first and second slender members for making a relative movement to each other by manipulating the manipulation portion, first and second top end members provided at the top end of the first and second slender members, and a third top end member connected with the second slender member and moving between the first and second top end members in accordance with the relative movement of the first and second slender member, wherein the first and second top end members are provided with concavities opening in the top end direction, the first and second top end members are separated to each other by a predetermined distance which can be changed, and the third top end member enters into a space located at the top end side of the bottom of the concavities of the first and second top end members.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The first and second top end members are provided with a link mechanism by which the distance between the first and second top end members can be changed.
      <br/>
      The link mechanism is actuated by the relative movement of the first and second slender members in response to the operation of the manipulation portion.
      <br/>
      The distance between the first and second top end members is varied only when the relative movement of the first and second slender members exceeds a predetermined degree.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the third top end member is moved immediately by the relative movement of the first and second slender members.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In the suture ligating device of the present invention, the first and second top end members and the third top end member form a closed space when the third top end member enters in the space between the first and second top end members.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a knot of a suture formed outside of a human body is secured in the closed space and transferred to tissues to be ligated inside of the human body.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Further in the suture ligating device, the first and second top end members and the third top end member form a closed space when the third top end member enters in the space formed between the first and second top end members.
      <br/>
      First and second knots of a suture are formed outside of a human body, and accordingly, the first knot is placed on an end surface formed by the first, second and third top end members, and the second knot is secured in the closed space, wherein the first and second knots are transferred to tissues to be ligated inside of the human body by inserting the suture ligating device in the human body while applying an appropriate pulling tension to the suture.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Consequently, a knot or knots can be transferred to the inner body of the patient without being lost or separated from suture ligating device, and thus the tissues are reliably and efficiently ligated therein.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="22">Referring now the drawings, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail.</p>
    <p num="23">
      FIG. 1 shows an overall structure of the suture ligating device in the first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1(a) is a side view, FIG. 1(b) is a plan view, FIG. 1(c) is an enlarged sectional view taken along the line C--C of FIG. 1(b), and FIG. 1(d) is an enlarged sectional view taken along the line D--D of FIG. 1(b).
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2, 3 and 4 respectively show expanded views of the top end portion of the suture ligating device 1.
    </p>
    <p num="24">As shown in these drawings, the suture ligating device 1 of the present invention is comprised of manipulation portions 2 formed in a circle shape similar to a grip of scissors, first and second rod members 3 and 4 extending from the manipulation portions 2, first and second top end members 5 and 6 each having a plate shape formed at an end of the first rod member 3, and a third top end member 7 connected to an end of the second rod member 4 and moved between the first and second top end members 5 and 6.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The manipulation portion 2 is provided with a stopper mechanism 2a comprised of a protrusion formed on one of the manipulation portions and grooves of a saw tooth shape formed on the other manipulation portion.
      <br/>
      By fitting the protrusion with the grooves, the manipulation portions 2 can keep its closed state.
      <br/>
      However, the stopper mechanism 2a is not an essential element, and the suture ligating device 1 of the present invention can achieve its object without having the stopper mechanism 2a.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the example of FIGS. 1-4, while the first rod member 3 is formed integrally with one of the manipulation portions 2, the second rod member 4 is divided into a unit 4a in the side of the manipulation portion and a unit 4b in the top end side.
      <br/>
      The top end of the unit 4a in the manipulation portion side is bent about 90 (degree)  as shown by the dotted line of FIG. 1(b).
      <br/>
      Axes 8 and 9 are provided at the corner and the top end of the bent portion, respectively.
      <br/>
      The axis 8 rotatably connects the unit 4a of the manipulation portion and the first rod member 3.
      <br/>
      The axis 9 rotatably connects the units 4a in the manipulation side and the unit 4b in the top end side.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      A dovetail groove 3a is provided at the straight portion of the first rod member 3.
      <br/>
      A protrusion 4c is provided on the second rod member 4 to fit into the dovetail groove 3a.
      <br/>
      By having this arrangement, the first and second rod members 3 and 4 are slidably connected in the longitudinal direction.
      <br/>
      This relationship is shown in the cross sectional views of FIGS. 1(c) and 1(d).
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Under the foregoing configuration, by open and close movement of the manipulation portions 2, the top end of the unit 4a connected to the second rod member 4 rotates around the axis 8, which causes the forward and backward movements of the second rod member 4 in parallel with the first rod member 3.
      <br/>
      Namely, in FIG. 1, the second rod member 4 moves downward relative to the first rod member 3 when the manipulation portions 2 are opened, and moves upward when the manipulation portions 2 are closed.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      As described above, the end of the first rod member 3 is provided with the first top end member 5 and the second top end member 6 which are separated from one another as shown in FIG. 1(a).
      <br/>
      Further, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, protrusions 5a and 5b are formed on the first top end member 5, and protrusions 6a and 6b are formed on the second top end member 6.
      <br/>
      Further in FIG. 2(a), between the protrusions 5a and 5b and between 6a and 6b, concaves 12 are formed.
      <br/>
      The top end members 5 and 6 are connected to each other at their base end by a connecting member 14.
      <br/>
      The connecting member 14 is employed for increasing the mechanical strength of each of the top end members 5 and 6, but may not be necessary when, for instance, the strength of the top end member 5 and 6 is high enough.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In this example, the third top end member 7 is formed in a U-shape as shown in FIG. 2(a), an end of which has a plate like shape.
      <br/>
      Two axes 10 and 11 are provided at the base end of the third top member 7.
      <br/>
      The axis 10 rotatably connects the third top end member 7 to the first rod member 3.
      <br/>
      The axis 11 rotatably connects the third top end member 7 to the end of the second rod member 4.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Under the configuration noted above, when the manipulation portions 2 are opened, the second rod member 4 is moved downward in FIG. 1, i.e., backward on a longitudinal axis, relative to the first rod member 3.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the third top end member 7 rotates about the axis 10 thereby retreating from the space between the first and second top end members 3 and 4 as shown in FIG. 4, thereby creating an open space formed by the concaves 12.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      A top end surface 7b of the third top end member 7 is formed in a groove like shape as best shown in FIG. 3(a).
      <br/>
      The protrusions 5a, 5b and 6a, 6b of the first and second top end members 3 and 4 extend beyond the top end surface 7b, thereby forming a second concave 13 at the end of the third top end member 7.
      <br/>
      Preferably, these concaves should be chamfered and surface treated, such as an abrasion or other polishing, so that the suture may smoothly slide on the surface of the concaves.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In the above embodiment, although the second rod member 4 is formed of the two rod like units 4a and 4b, the unit 4b at the top end side may be formed of a wire and the third top end member 7 may be provided with a spring which biases the top end member 7 toward the space between the first and second top end members 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the first rod member 3 may be formed as a tubular body through which the second rod member 4 is slidably provided.
    </p>
    <p num="34">With reference to FIGS. 5-8, the method of using the suture ligating device of the present invention is explained in the following for an example of suturing the dissected tissues A1 and A2.</p>
    <p num="35">
      As shown in FIG. 5, the tissues A1 and A2 to be sutured are aligned and pierced by the suture 20.
      <br/>
      This operation is performed with use of a guide device in a forceps shape having a thread for medical treatment such as a suture needle guide device disclosed in the Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 9-56719. The ends of the suture 20 piercing through the tissues A1 and A2 are pulled back from the human body through the trocar together with the guide device.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Thereafter, a knot N is formed on the suture 20 which is pulled back from the human body to outside as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Then, by retreating the third top end member 7 from the space between the first and second top end members 5 and 6 as shown in FIG. 4, the knot N is placed into the concaves of the first and second top end members 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the third top end member 7 is entered into the space between the first and second top end members 5 and 6.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In this manner, the knot N is confined in a closed space formed by the first and second top end members 5 and 6 and the third top end member 7 as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the knot N is securely captured in the closed space noted above and the third top end member 7 is inserted in the loop of the suture between the tissues A1, A2 and the knot N. Therefore, unlike the conventional method, during the course of sending the knot to the ligating place, the knot will not be lost or separated from the device.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Under this condition, the suture ligating device 1 is pressed toward the tissues A1 and A2, while applying an appropriate level of tension to the suture.
      <br/>
      In this event, since the knot N is not directly pressed, but rather advances by itself toward the tissues A1 and A2 by the tension applied to the suture, the knot N can be smoothly transferred to the position of the tissues A1 and A2.
      <br/>
      When reaching the tissues, the third top end member 7 is withdrawn as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      By pressing the suture ligating device further toward the tissues and applying an appropriate amount of tension to the suture, the knot N can be tightened therein.
      <br/>
      In order to form a plurality of knots, the above described operation may be repeatedly conducted by predetermined times.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Referring back to FIG. 7, the positional relationship between an inside surface 7a of the third top end member 7 and a bottom surface 12a of the concave 12 is described.
      <br/>
      At the time the third top end member 7 enters the space 15 between the first and second top end members 5 and 6, the inside surface 7a of the third top end member 7 is positioned ahead of the bottom surface 12a of the concave 12.
      <br/>
      Under this configuration, at the time of pressing the knot toward the inner tissues, the knot N held between the first and second top end members 5 and 6 can contact only with the bottom surface.
      <br/>
      Although the suture 20 and knot N look large in size in FIG. 7, an actual suture and knot are much smaller and can be completely stored within the space between the top end members 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the knot is smoothly transferred to the ligating location without contacting with the inside surface 7a.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The suture ligating device 1 of the present invention can send two knots at a time to inner tissues of the human body for ligating the tissues therein.
      <br/>
      An example of process for sending two knots at a time is described in FIGS. 9 and 10. As shown in FIG. 5, the suture 20 piercing through the tissues is pulled back to the outside the human body where two knots Na and Nb are formed in a manner shown in FIG. 9 The third top end member 7 is retreated from the space between the first and second top end members 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      Then, the knot Nb is placed in the concave 12 of the first and second top end members 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 10, the third top end member 7 enters the space between the first and second top end members 5 and 6 such that it also enters a circle formed between the knot Na and knot Nb.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      By this operation, the knot Nb is secured in the closed space formed by the concave 12 of the first and second top end members 5 and 6 and the third top end member 7.
      <br/>
      The knot Na is placed at the outside of the third top end member 7.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, since the protrusions 5a, 5b and 6a, 6b are extending beyond the third top end member 7, the second concave 13 is formed at the outside of the third top end member 7.
      <br/>
      Thus, the knot Na is positioned on the second concave 13.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Subsequently, the suture ligating device 1 is inserted in the human body toward the tissues A1 and A2 while applying an appropriate level of tension to the suture 20.
      <br/>
      In this event, since the top end surface 7b of the third top end member 7 is formed in a concave shape, a contact area between the knot Na and the third top end member 7 is small, resulting in a small friction therebetween.
      <br/>
      Thus, the suture ligating device can smoothly transfer the knots Na and Nb toward the inner tissues.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      When the knot Na positioned in the second concave 13 reaches the tissues, the knot Na is ligated therein by increasing the tension applied to the suture 20.
      <br/>
      Then, the third top end member 7 is retreated from the space between first and second the top end members 5 and 6, leaving the knot Nb.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the tension is continuously applied to the suture 20 in that state and the device is further pressed toward the tissues to tighten the second knot therein.
      <br/>
      Consequently, two knots are transferred to the tissues and fasten the tissues by a single operation of the suture ligating device of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The ligation is made sufficiently firmly so that it will not loosen, since, unlike the conventional devices, the suture ligating device of the present invention does not need to send the second knot before the first knot becomes loose.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      FIG. 11 shows the second embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this example, the protrusions provided at the end of the first and second top end members 5 and 6 have different height (length) from the other.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 11, thus protrusion 52b is shorter (lower) than the protrusion 52a, and protrusion 62b is shorter (lower) than the protrusion 62a.
      <br/>
      However, the third top end member 72 has a projection 72c as shown in FIG. 11(a) which has the same height of the longer (higher) protrusions 52a and 62a when inserted in the concave 12.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      An opposing portion of the connecting member 14 against the third top end member 72 is extended toward the end of the first and second top end member 52a and 62a as shown by the dotted line, thereby increasing the mechanical strength of the first and second top end member 52 and 62.
      <br/>
      As described above, the size or connecting range of the connecting member 14 is not essential and can be varied so long as the knot will not directly contact with the connecting member and can enter the space of the concave 12 and also the third top end member 72 is able to enter the space between the first and second top end members 5 and 6.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Because of the above described configuration, after the knot Na is ligated, the third top end member 72 can be smoothly retreated from the concave 12 without having the knot Na trapped between the protrusions 52b and 62b and the third top end member 72.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the third top end member 72 is provided with a rectangular through hole 72d in stead of the groove.
      <br/>
      By this arrangement, in a case where a knot needs to be retracted for some reason, the knot is prevented from directly contacting with the inside surface 72a so that the knot can be smoothly retracted.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Further, the end face of the third top end member 72 is curved as a whole because of the projection 72c.
      <br/>
      By this arrangement, the second concave 13 is formed deeper so that the suture can be prevented from separating from the suture ligating device.
      <br/>
      Also, in a case where the protrusions 52a and 62a may hinder an operation for tying the knot, the protrusions 52a and 62a can be lowered to the extent of the curve of the third top end member 72.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      FIG. 12 shows the third embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 12(a) is a plan view and FIG. 12(b) is a front view of the end portion of the third embodiment.
      <br/>
      The feature of this embodiment is that the third top end member 72 has a shape different from that of FIG. 11. The projection 73c of the third top end member 73 and the first and second projections 52a and 62a are arranged in the same length (height) while an intermediate area 73b is curved inwardly to form the second concave 13 therebetween.
      <br/>
      Further, extended portions 73d are provided at the end of the third top end member 73 in such a way to cover the lower protrusions 52b and 62b.
      <br/>
      Thus, as shown in FIG. 12(a), the curved (intermediate) area 73b is formed between the extended portions 73d.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      By this arrangement, the curved area 73b has a broader area because of the extended portions 73d, which makes the angle of the crossing suture at the knot close to 180 degrees.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the knot Na at the ligating location can be tightened easily and securely when the tension is provided to both ends of the suture.
      <br/>
      Further, by forming the end portion of the third top end member 73 in a curved shape, the depth and the surface area of the second concave 13 are increased, and consequently, the knot Na is securely transferred to the ligating location without separating from the suture ligating device.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In the foregoing embodiments, the shape of the manipulation portion does not need to be a forceps shape but can be other shapes such as a gun shape.
      <br/>
      Further, although the manipulation portion of this embodiment is formed to be grasped by hand, such a grasping portion may be provided separately from the manipulation portion.
      <br/>
      Thus, in such an example, the suture ligating device can be manipulated by the manipulation portion while holding the device by the separately provided grasping portion.

      As shown in FIG. 13, the suture ligating device 100 of this embodiment is generally formed in a gun shape and comprised of a manipulation portion 101, a hollow cylindrical body 102 (corresponding to the first rod member in the foregoing embodiments) integrally connected with the manipulation portion, an action rod member 103 (corresponding to the second rod member in the foregoing embodiments) movably inserted in the cylindrical body 102, a first top end member 104, a second top end member 105, a third top end member 106, and a link mechanism M which connects the above noted components.

    <p num="53">
      The manipulation portion 101 is formed approximately in a U-shape and comprised of a frame 101a having a protrusion 101h, a manipulation lever 101c rotatably connected to the frame 101a via an axis 101b, and a spring means 101d for biasing the manipulation lever 101c in such a direction that the manipulation lever 101c is separated from the frame 101a.
      <br/>
      A protrusion 101e is provided at the bottom of the manipulation lever 101c.
      <br/>
      A number of saw tooth shaped grooves 101f are formed at the bottom of the frame 101a.
      <br/>
      Thus, by fitting the protrusion 101e in one of the grooves 101f, the manipulation lever 101c can be held in a desired position.

      The upper end of the manipulation lever 101c is inserted in a space provided inside the frame 101a and connected rotatably about the axis 101b.

      In FIG. 17(b), a pin 112 is inserted in a slit 103b formed on the action rod member 103.

      The pin 112 is connected to each end of link plates 113 at both ends.
      <br/>
      Further in this arrangement, a coil spring 114 is provided between a flange portion 103c of the action rod member 103 and the pin 112 in a compressed condition.
      <br/>
      The other end of the link plate 113 is connected to the through holes 104d and 105d by the pin 115.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 17(b), the pin 112 is positioned at about the bottom of the slit 103b even when pressed upward by the coil spring 114 because the first and second top end members 104 and 105 are pressingly closed with one another.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      Under the foregoing configuration, if the action rod member 103 is retreated (moves in a downward direction of FIG. 17), the coil spring 114 is then extended corresponding to the degree of retreat of the action rod member 103.
      <br/>
      Relative to the cylindrical body 102, the pin 112 is moved inside the slit 103b upward in FIG. 17(b).
      <br/>
      Thus, the vertical position of the pin 112 remains unchanged until it reaches the top end of the slit 103b.
      <br/>
      When the pin 112 reaches the top end of the slit 103b and the action rod member 103 further moves downward, the pin 112 is then moved downward by being pressed by the top end of the slit 103b.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the link plates 113 are accordingly pulled downward, which makes the first and second top end members 104 and 105 begin to rotate around the screw 107 in the through hole 102c.
      <br/>
      Thus, the first and second top end members 104 and 105 are opened in proportion to the movement of the action rod member 103, which will be described again with reference to FIG. 20.

      The action rod member 103 is in the position most advanced in the top end direction, i.e., the manipulation lever 101c is in the position nearest to the frame 101a as shown by the dotted line in FIG. 13.

    <p num="65">FIG. 19 shows the top end portion of the suture ligating device of the present invention wherein the manipulation lever 103c is retreated to the position shown by the solid line in FIG. 13, thereby moving the action rod member 103 backward in the cylindrical body 102, i.e., downward in FIG. 19. Because of the downward movement of the action rod member 103, the pin 111 in the inclined guide groove 110a of the plate cam 110 also moves downward along the groove, causing the pin 109 to move in a left direction of FIG. 19. Therefore, the third top end member 106 is opened in proportion to the downward movement of the action rod member 103.</p>
    <p num="66">
      During the first stage of the downward movement of the action rod member 103, the first and second top end members 104 and 105 are unchanged as noted above.
      <br/>
      This is because even if the action rod member 103 goes downward, the coil spring 114 is extended correspondingly so that the pin 112 maintains the same position as shown in FIG. 18. This situation continues until the pin 112 reaches the top end of the slit 103b.

      FIG. 20 shows the state of the suture ligating device wherein the action rod member 103 is further retreated and the manipulation lever 103c has reached the position shown by the two dotted line of FIG. 13. In this event, the first and second top end members 104 and 105 are opened in proportion to the movement of the action rod member 103.
      <br/>
      Thus, all of the three top end members are opened, which is achieved in the following.

    <p num="68">
      Because the action rod member 103 moves backward (downward), the third top end member 106 withdrawn from the space formed by first and second top end members 104 and 105 as shown in FIG. 19.

      <br/>
      Accordingly, the pin 112 is moved downward together with the action rod member 103, which pulls down the link plates 113 and thus the pins 115 of the first and second top end members 104 and 105.
      <br/>
      As a result, the first and second top end members 104 and 105 connected with these linkage means start to rotate around the screw 107 inserted into the through hole 102c.

      Consequently, the first and second top end members 104 and 105 are opened in right and left directions of FIG. 20, resulting in opening all of the top end members.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Next, the method of using the suture ligating device of FIGS. 13-20 is explained.
      <br/>
      First, as shown in FIG. 5, the tissues dissected by surgery are pierced by the suture 20.
      <br/>
      Then, the ends of the suture 20 are pulled back outside the human body and a knot N is formed as shown in FIG. 6.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      In this stage, the suture ligating device is operated so that only the third top end member 106 is opened in a manner shown in FIG. 19. Then, the knot N is entered into the concaves 12 provided between the first and second top end members 104 and 105.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the third top end member 106 is closed in a manner shown in FIG. 18. Since the knot N is placed in a closed space formed by the concaves 12 and the third top end member 106, the knot N can be transferred to the inner body of the patient without being lost or separated from the suture ligating device.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Under this condition, the suture ligating device is sent to the place where the tissues be ligated.
      <br/>
      After the top end of the suture ligating device has reached the place to be ligated, all of the three top end members are opened as shown in FIG. 20 and both ends of the suture 20 are pulled by a higher tension.
      <br/>
      By this operation, the tissues are tightly ligated therein.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 21, since the knot forming suture 20 is pulled from right and left by the first and second top end members 104 and 105 which are opened and separated by a certain distance, the knot can be firmly ligated.
      <br/>
      This is because each end of the suture is pulled in the opposite direction, such as 180 degrees, from one another.
      <br/>
      Further, since the protrusions are prevented from contacting the tissues, the operation can be performed without damaging the tissues.
      <br/>
      By repeating the above noted procedure, a plurality of knots can be tied so that the suture will not become loose.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      As shown in FIG. 18, the suture ligating device includes the protrusions 104a and 105a of the first and second top end members 104 and 105.
      <br/>
      The third top end member 106 is also provided with the projection 106e.
      <br/>
      As a result, a second concave 13 is formed at the top end of the third top end member 106.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is also possible to form and transfer two knots at the same time by using this suture ligating device.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The size of the concaves 12 provided at the first and second top end members 104 and 105 may be varied depending on the kinds of the suture or thickness thereof.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the concaves are formed in a plate shape, although such a concave can be semicircular in cross section.
      <br/>
      Further, the top end face of the third top end member can be of any shape, such as a shape formed by cutting a hole in the axial direction or curvature in a segment shape as far as the top end face does not directly press the knot.
      <br/>
      For instance, the hole may not be a through hole, and the shape of the hole can be a complete circle, ellipse, parallelogram or trapezoid shape.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Although the manipulation portion is formed in a gun shape in this embodiment, it can be formed in other shapes such as an injector shape in which the action rod member 103 inside the cylindrical body can be manipulated.
      <br/>
      The manipulation portion can be made as an ordinary forceps type like the one shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="75">Although only preferred embodiments are specifically illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and within the purview of the appended claims without departing the spirit and intended scope of the invention.</p>
