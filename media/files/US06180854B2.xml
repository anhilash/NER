    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates generally to the breeding and development of tomato plants.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the invention relates to new hybrid cherry tomato plants having both a determinate habit and delayed-ripening fruit.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Tomato plants having a determinate growth habit are particularly desired by growers because the plants are shorter and have an earlier, concentrated flowering.
      <br/>
      This growth habit is generally recognized as being conferred by the presence of the sp allele (Tigchelaar, Tomato Breeding In: M. J. Bassett, ed.
      <br/>
      BREEDING VEGETABLE CROPS AVI, Westport, Conn., 1986).
      <br/>
      The determinate trait is important from an economic standpoint since concentrated flowering results in concentrated fruit set which translates to reduced harvest costs because more fruit are picked per harvest.
      <br/>
      In extreme northern and southern latitudes, full yield potential is not realized from indeterminate varieties due to the occurrence of frost.
      <br/>
      In tropical and sub-tropical areas, full yield potential is not fully realized from indeterminate varieties due to the onset of disease.
      <br/>
      In each of these situations, the use of determinate varieties increases the probability of realizing full yield potential.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Most commercial cherry tomato varieties are indeterminate (e.g., Red Cherry, Large, Cherry Sweet, Sweet 100, and Sweet Chelsea).
      <br/>
      Several determinate commercial cherry tomato varieties have been developed (e.g., Baxter's Early Bush, Cherry Grande, and Mountain Bell which are available from e.g., Tomato Growers Supply Co., Fort Meyers, Fla. and Rogers NK Seed Co., Boise, Id.).
      <br/>
      More recently new determinate cherry tomato varieties have been developed (e.g., EY 12, EY 14, EY 15, Zeraim Gedera, Gedera, Israel) but their status as commercial or garden varieties has not been established.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another desirable trait in tomato cultivars is delayed-ripening fruit.
      <br/>
      BR 124, BR 140 (available from Hazera Seed Co., Rehovot, Israel) and FA 138 (available from Zeraim Gedera, Gedera, Israel) are known ripening-delayed cherry tomato varieties.
      <br/>
      All of these varieties are indeterminate.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In tomato, the main value of non-ripening or ripening-delayed fruit relates to fruit quality (flavor, shelf life) and durability.
      <br/>
      Since vine-ripened fruit of normal tomato varieties often cannot survive the rigors of harvesting, packing, and shipping (due to loss of firmness), the majority of tomatoes available in the market place are picked at the green stage when they are most firm, but have not yet reached peak flavor.
      <br/>
      Ripening-delay allows the tomato to reach its peak in flavor yet still retain sufficient firmness to survive harvest, packing, and shipping.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In tomato, several mutations have been reported to slow or inhibit ripening.
      <br/>
      These include dg, Nr, nor, and rin (Tigchelaar &amp; Stevens, Plant Breeding Reviews 4:273-311 (1986)).
      <br/>
      These mutations are believed to interrupt the normal climacteric ripening pattern of tomato fruit.
      <br/>
      The best characterized of these mutations are nor and rin.
      <br/>
      In terms of inheritance and phenotype, both mutations are similar.
      <br/>
      In the homozygous state, nor and rin fruit do not fully ripen and are hence referred to as non-ripening plants.
      <br/>
      In the heterozygous state these mutations result in delayed-ripening (compared to normal ripening of wild type fruit).
      <br/>
      This intermediate phenotype means that the mutations are semi-dominant (Kopeliovitch, et al., J Amer. Soc. Hort. Sci. 107(3):361-364 (1982)).
      <br/>
      The ripening inhibition reported in the tomato line Alcobaca has been shown to be caused by a mutation in an allele of nor (Lobo, et al., J Amer. Soc. Hort. Sci. 109:741-745 (1984)).
      <br/>
      The mutation Nr results in fruit that do not ripen fully (only to a pale orange) and may be the basis for the long shelf life of the variety Longkeeper.
      <br/>
      The mutation dg has not been as well characterized as the other mutations.
      <br/>
      The mutation appears to delay fruit softening (Tong, et al., J. Amer. Soc. Hort. Sci. 114:635-638 (1989)).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Several determinate, ripening-delayed large-fruited tomato varieties are known (e.g., BR 84 (Hazera Seed Co.), Pik Ripe based on rin (Peto Seed Co., Saticoy, Calif.) and Lenor and Elenor based on nor (Pioneer Seed Co., Woodland, Calif.)).
      <br/>
      The prior art, however, lacks determinate, ripening-delayed yellow cherry tomato varieties.
      <br/>
      The present invention addresses these and other needs.

    <p num="10">Definitions</p>
    <p num="11">
      As used herein the term "cherry tomato" is used to refer to tomato varieties which have ripe fruit weight in the range of about 10 to about 30 grams, typically between about 15 and about 25 grams.
      <br/>
      The ripe fruit have a diameter between about 1.9 to about 3.8 cm, typically between about 2.5 and 3.0 cm. The shape of cherry tomato fruit are usually globular to slightly elliptical (i.e., fruit width and fruit length are about equivalent).
      <br/>
      Cherry tomato fruit differ from small-fruited pear-type varieties in that pear fruit are fully elliptical (i.e., fruit length is greater than fruit width) and from other varieties by virtue of lower fruit weight and fruit diameter.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Cherry tomatoes are sometimes designated as Lycopersicon esculentum var. cerasiforme.
      <br/>
      It is generally accepted that cultivated tomato lines were derived from var. cerasiforme via domestication (Jenkins, Econ.
      <br/>
      Bot. 2:379-392 (1948)).
      <br/>
      The main differences between the cerasiforme type and standard tomato cultivars is that the fruit of the cerasiforme types are less than half the size of the cultivated forms (see, Rick, Econ.
      <br/>
      Bot. 12:346-367 (1958)).
      <br/>
      The cerasiforme types can also be distinguished from the cultivated types by the presence of a slightly exserted stigma in the flowers (Taylor, Biosystematics of The Tomato.
      <br/>
      In: Atherton and Rudich, eds.
      <br/>
      THE TOMATO CROP.
      <br/>
      Chapman and Hail, NY, NY, 1986).
      <br/>
      Smaller fruit size is probably the main reason that some cherry tomato varieties are designated as cerasiforme types.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The term "yellow cherry tomato" refers to a tomato that is less than half the size of the cultivated tomato, with yellow ripe flesh and clear skin.</p>
    <p num="14">
      The term "determinate habit" is used herein to refer to growth of tomato varieties which have two or fewer nodes between inflorescences.
      <br/>
      Plants having a determinate habit can be distinguished from indeterminate types, which have three or more nodes between each inflorescence (see, Tigchelaar, supra).
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      As used herein, the terms "delayed-ripening" or "ripening-delayed" are used to refer to tomato plants which are heterozygous for an allele which inhibits the maturation of fruit of the plant.
      <br/>
      Fruit of plants that are homozygous for the allele do not ripen and are referred to as non-ripening.
      <br/>
      As discussed above, such alleles include dg, Nr, nor, and rin.
      <br/>
      Generally, ripening-delayed tomatoes of the invention are distinguished from normal-ripening plants in that at least 50% more marketable fruit remain after 15 days of storage at 20 (degree)  C. in ripening-delayed plants.
      <br/>
      The precise phenotype of a plant having the ripening-delayed trait will depend upon the particular gene.
      <br/>
      A summary of phenotypes of plants having various alleles is summarized in Table 1.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">
      The present invention provides hybrid cherry tomato plants having a determinate growth habit and delayed-ripening fruit.
      <br/>
      Usually, the plants of the invention result from crossing a first inbred cherry tomato plant having a determinate growth habit with a second cherry tomato plant from an inbred line having a determinate growth habit and non-ripening fruit.
      <br/>
      A preferred line for this purpose is 91047-15 (ATCC Accession No. 97316, deposited Oct. 13, 1995).
      <br/>
      As used herein a line is considered to be inbred even if it is an "open pollinated" line as a result of open field seed production.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The first parental line can be any commercially available or proprietary cherry tomato that has a determinate growth habit.
      <br/>
      An exemplary line is NC 2C.

      <br/>
      In addition, the invention provides cherry tomato seed which can be grown to yield a hybrid plant of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In another embodiment of this invention, a yellow cherry tomato hybrid with a determinate habit, delayed-ripening phenotype is produced.

      An exemplary line is 95274 (ATCC Accession No. 209,308, deposited Sep. 30, 1997).
      <br/>
      The preferred parental lines are 9201 1-NAS (ATCC Accession No. 209,309, deposited September 30, 1997) and 92011-NA4-BW2 (ATCC Accession No.209,310, deposited Sep. 30, 1997).
      <br/>
      The invention also provides cherry tomato fruit and seed produced by such hybrids or from the parental lines.

      In addition, the invention provides cherry tomato seed which can be grown to yield a hybrid plant of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The invention further provides methods of making a hybrid cherry tomato having a determinate growth habit and delayed-ripening fruit.
      <br/>
      The methods comprise crossing a first cherry tomato plant having a determinate growth habit with a second cherry tomato plant from an inbred line having a determinate growth habit and non-ripening fruit.
      <br/>
      F1 plants which have a determninate growth habit and delayed-ripening fruit are then selected.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="23">
      The hybrids of the invention are produced from crossing a first determinate parental line with a second determinate, non-ripening parental line.
      <br/>
      A suitable second parental line is produced by crossing and pedigree selection to identify progeny having the desired traits.
      <br/>
      In particular, a second parent line used to make hybrids of the invention should be homozygous for a mutation conferring a non-ripening trait (e.g., rin or nor).
      <br/>
      A preferred line for this purpose is inbred line 91047-15.
      <br/>
      This line has been identified in the F3 generation of a BR 124 segregating population when test-cross hybrids between randomly selected F3 plants had been crossed with Baxter's Early Bush.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      F2 segregation data shows that BR 124 is an indeterminate hybrid between a non-ripening line and a normal ripening line.
      <br/>
      Indeterminate growth habit is a dominant phenotype caused by complete dominance of the Sp allele.
      <br/>
      Thus, an indeterminate growth habit phenotype could be due to homozygous Sp alleles (Sp/Sp) or heterozygous alleles (Sp/sp).
      <br/>
      Homozygous sp alleles (sp/sp) are reflected in a determinate growth habit phenotype.
      <br/>
      BR 124 has been found to be heterozygous for the Sp allele which confers its indeterminate growth habit.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The 91047-15 or other (second) parental line can be used to produce hybrid cherry tomato plants having a determinate growth habit and delayed-ripening fruit.
      <br/>
      The methods of the invention can be used to produce cherry tomato hybrid plants with any other desired characteristics, such as disease resistance, improved tomato flavor, and the like.
      <br/>
      Typically, the methods involve crossing a suitable first parental cherry tomato line, having a determinate habit conferred by the presence of homozygous sp alleles, with a second determinate, non-ripening parental line.
      <br/>
      Suitable lines for the first parental line include, but are not limited to, NC 1 C and NC 2C (available from North Carolina State University), Baxter's Early Bush, Cherry Grande, and Mountain Bell (available from e.g. Tomato Growers Supply Co., Fort Meyers, Fla. and Rogers NK Seed Co., Boise, Id.).
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, the second parental line can be the male parent as described for instance in U.S. Pat. No. 4,843,186.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The F1 generation is then examined for the presence of determinate habit and delayed fruit ripening in a single plant.
      <br/>
      The determinate trait is identified by determining the number of nodes between each inflorescence.
      <br/>
      Determinate plants will have two or fewer nodes, indeterminate plants will have three or more nodes.
      <br/>
      The delayed-ripening trait will be identified by slower ripening as compared to wild-type plants.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      As noted above, the second parental line is homozygous for an allele conferring the non-ripening trait.
      <br/>
      The ripening trait is caused by alleles that are partially dominant.
      <br/>
      Thus, hybrids made with plants having a normal ripening allele and a non-ripening allele have a delayed-ripening phenotype.
      <br/>
      The terms used herein to describe ripeness of tomato fruit are according to standard ripeness classes as described, for instance, in THE TOMATO CROP Atherton and Rudich eds. (Chapman Hall, 1986).
      <br/>
      The ripeness classes given fruit are set forth in Table 2.

      <br/>
      -- 6      Red       Over 90% red, desirable table ripeness.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In the second parental line, the non-ripening trait is typically characterized by which do not turn fully red in color.
      <br/>
      Usually, even when fully mature the fruit are only yellow to yellow-pink in color.
      <br/>
      The trait is expressed in all fruit and the fruit will not break down due to senescence at the rate of a wild-type line.
      <br/>
      In the hybrid, full red color is reached but this occurs at a slower pace than with wild-type lines.

      <br/>
      Randomly chosen F3 plants were used in test-crosses with Baxter's Early Bush.

      In addition to using pollen from the F3 plants for the test crosses, each randomly selected plant was self-pollinated.
      <br/>
      Upon evaluation of the test hybrids in the field, several determinate test hybrids were identified.

      The appearance of the recessive determinate growth habit in the F4 generation indicated that the BR 124 hybrid is heterozygous at the sp locus.

      Evaluation of the F5 generation demonstrated the line to be determinate and to contain two separate ripening phenotypes, normal ripening and non-ripening.
    </p>
    <p num="44">9201 1-NA8 was an individual plant from the F5 generation that was determined to be determinate and normal ripening. 92011-NA4-BW2 was from the same F5 generation and was determined to be determinate and non-ripening.</p>
    <p num="45">
      B. Production of determinate, delayed-ripening yellow cherry tomato hybrids A crossing block was established to make yellow determinate delayed-ripening cherry tomato hybrids.
      <br/>
      The non-ripening parent was 9201 1-NA4-BW2 and the normal ripening parent was 9201 l-NA8.
      <br/>
      Both parents were derived from a population of Gold Nugget tomatoes crossed with BR 124 as described in Example III.
      <br/>
      Of six lines of yellow determinate, delayed-ripening cherry tomato plants evaluated in nurseries, 95274 was selected for commercial evaluation.
      <br/>
      It was selected based on plant vigor and minimal leaf curl with good foliage cover, fruit firmness, and adequate fruit size, fruit yield sensory attributes and shelf life.
