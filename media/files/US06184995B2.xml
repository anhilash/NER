    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a printer apparatus, a control method thereof, and a printer system and, more particularly, to a printer apparatus through, for example, a network, a control method thereof, and a printer system.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Hitherto, an output apparatus such as a printer or the like is connected to a host computer (hereinbelow, simply referred to as a host) or the like by an LAN such as Ethernet or the like, thereby constructing an information processing system.
      <br/>
      Not only one host but also a plurality of hosts, a plurality of printers, a plurality of scanners, and further, a facsimile apparatus, a communicating control apparatus, and the like for performing a data communication with an external apparatus are connected to the LAN, so that there is a case where an LAN system of a large scale which shares data transmission paths is constructed.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In such an LAN system, since information processing apparatuses constructing the system efficiently uses the data transmission paths, each of the constructing apparatuses always monitors a busy state of the data transmission path.
      <br/>
      When a certain constructing apparatus tries to communicate with another constructing apparatus or when the communication is impossible for a predetermined time or more because a load of the data transmission path is high during the communication, the LAN system controls so as to temporarily stop the communication (it is called a time-out process).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Further, a plurality of same kind (same performance, same format, and same operation environment can be set by the same procedure) of apparatuses can be also connected to such an LAN system.
      <br/>
      However, upon connection, it is necessary to perform an environment setting to operate in the LAN system to each of the apparatuses.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      However, in the conventional apparatus, since a plurality of hosts and peripheral equipment are connected, a large amount of data flows into the data transmission path in a lump.
      <br/>
      When the load of the data transmission path rises and the communication is temporarily interrupted, the user cannot judge whether the interruption of the communication was caused due to a failure of an apparatus on the communication partner of such a communication or by a reason such that the own apparatus finished a session or by a delay of the communication due to a mere increase in the load of the data transmission path.
      <br/>
      There is, consequently, a problem such that the time-out process is unconditionally performed when a predetermined time elapses after the time point of the interruption of the communication.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      For example, when the transmission of data is interrupted while the printer is receiving the data from the host, the user cannot judge whether the interruption occurs because the host of the data transmitting source interrupted the data transmission or a delay of the transmission of data occurs due to an increase in load of the data transmission path.
      <br/>
      Thus, the user performs the time-out process without intending.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      When a plurality of same kind of printers are connected to the LAN system, since the environment setting has to be similarly repetitively performed many times, the setting operation is very troublesome.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, as for specific information (for example, apparatus identifier), the peculiar environment setting has to be performed to each printer, so that the user of the apparatus is required to carefully perform the setting.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a problem such that in spite of a fact that such an environment setting operation is troublesome and needs a scrupulous care, the setting is likely to fail.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described in detail hereinbelow with reference to the drawings.</p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a construction of a printer apparatus as a typical embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      As a printer engine 100 of the apparatus shown in FIG. 1, an apparatus for forming an image in accordance with an electrophotographic system (laser beam printer), an apparatus for forming an image in accordance with an ink jet system (ink jet printer), or an apparatus for forming an image in accordance with the other system can be also used.
    </p>
    <p num="20">A plurality of printer apparatus are connected to an LAN and receive image data from a host computer (hereinbelow, referred to as a host) through the LAN and can output an image.</p>
    <p num="21">In FIG. 1, reference numeral 1 denotes a host interface (I/F) for communicating with a host which is not connected to the network; 2 a transmission path to which communication data with the host is transferred; 3 a page memory having a capacity to store character data of a code data format, figure forming information, and image data, of at least one page of a recording paper received from the host through the host I/F 1, and other control information; 4 a font memory in which character pattern data has been stored in correspondence to the character code data; 5 a CPU for controlling the whole apparatus; and 6 a dot pattern memory for storing a dot pattern of at least one page of a recording paper developed on the basis of the character code data, figure forming information, or the image data stored in the page memory 3.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Reference numeral 7 denotes an ROM for storing a control program (including a program according to a flowchart, which will be described hereinlater) to control the whole apparatus and 8 indicates an RAM.
      <br/>
      When the CPU 5 reads out the control program stored in the ROM 7 and executes the control process of the whole apparatus, the RAM 8 is used as a temporary work area to/from which various data is inputted or outputted and which is used in order to execute such a control process.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 9 denotes an FIFO memory in which the dot pattern data is inputted from the dot pattern memory 6 and is temporarily stored and is outputted in accordance with an FIFO (First In First Out) system; and 10 an image forming unit interface (I/F) for receiving the image data (dot pattern data) from the FIFO memory 9 and outputting to the printer engine 100.
      <br/>
      The printer engine 100 performs a print output on the basis of the outputted image data.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Further, reference numeral 11 denotes an operation panel having a keyboard for performing an input to set various operating conditions such as setting of on-line/off-line states of the host interface 1 and an expansion interface (I/F) 17 and the like by the user of the apparatus, an LCD, an LED, and the like; 12 an operation panel interface (I/F) for outputting signals generated on the basis of various instructions inputted from the operation panel 11 to the CPU 5; 13 a memory (environment memory) for preserving various operation environment set values of the apparatus which can be set from the operation panel 11 or host through the host I/F 1 and expansion I/F 17; 16 a clock generator for supplying a clock signal (CLK) to the CPU 5; 14 and 15 a data bus and an address bus each for connecting the component elements of the above mentioned apparatus; 17 the expansion I/F to which a network corresponding board is attached; and 18 a transmission path to which communication data to/from the network is transferred.</p>
    <p num="24">As will be obviously understood from the above construction, the various operating conditions of the apparatus can be set by not only the operation panel 11 but also the host through the host I/F 1 and expansion I/F 17.</p>
    <p num="25">
      In the apparatus with the construction as mentioned above, the CPU 5 controls so that the data received through the host I/F 1 and expansion I/F 17 is stored into the page memory 3, also executes a processing program such as an interpreter or the like stored in the ROM 7, analyzes a reception character code stored in the page memory 3, accesses to the font memory 4, and reads out the corresponding font pattern.
      <br/>
      Or the CPU analyzes the received figure forming information and allows dot patterns to be generated, thereby developing such patterns into the dot pattern memory 6.
    </p>
    <p num="26">An environment setting of the apparatus in an environment in which a plurality of apparatuses with the above-mentioned construction are connected to the host via the LAN will now be described hereinbelow.</p>
    <p num="27">FIG. 2 is a diagram showing a network environment in which two printer apparatuses (it is assumed that one apparatus is an apparatus A and the other is an apparatus B) each having the construction shown in FIG. 1 are connected to the host through the LAN.</p>
    <p num="28">
      In FIG. 2, reference numeral 300 denotes a host; 11A an operation panel of the apparatus A; 11B an operation panel of the apparatus B; 301A an LCD of the operation panel 11A; 301B an LCD of the operation panel 11B; 302A and 302B switches "A" of the push type of the apparatuses A and B, respectively; 303A and 303B switches "B" of the push type of the apparatuses A and B, respectively; and 304A and 304B switches "C" of the push type of the apparatuses A and B, respectively.
      <br/>
      In the apparatuses A and B, the switches "A", the switches "B", and the switches "C" have the same function, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="29">The operation when the switch 302A is depressed will now be described.</p>
    <p num="30">
      When the switch 302A is depressed, predetermined information is transmitted from the apparatus A to the host 300 through the transmission path 2 in response to the depression.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the host 300 executes the program which the host always has and transmits the information received from the apparatus A as command data to the apparatus B through the transmission path 2.
      <br/>
      The apparatus B analyzes the command and sets the operating conditions of the apparatus B into the same state as that when the switch 302B provided on the apparatus B is depressed.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      As already described, the apparatus communicates with the host and receives data through the LAN for communicating in accordance with a predetermined communication protocol.
      <br/>
      However, when the data reception from the host is interrupted without executing the communication end procedure determined in the communication protocol or without receiving a predetermined printing process end command from the host, the following process is executed.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      That is, after waiting for the data transmission from the host for a predetermined period of time on the basis of the values of various operating conditions which were temporarily set in the environment memory 13 or RAM 8, when there is no reception of subsequent data, the data reception waiting state is forcedly finished.
      <br/>
      A forced outputting process based on the data received so far is executed or a process of abandoning the received data or the like is executed, and the processing routine advances to an input waiting state of the next data (hereinafter, such a process is called a time-out process).
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A print outputting process which is executed by using the apparatus with the above-mentioned construction while receiving data from the host through the LAN will now be described hereinbelow with reference to a flowchart shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In this instance, the processing program for executing the process shown in the flowchart of FIG. 3 has been stored in the ROM 7 of the apparatus shown in FIG. 1 and the CPU 5 executes the program.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      First in step S201, a check is made to see whether the data has been received from the host through the host I/F 1.
      <br/>
      When it is judged that there is a data reception, step S203 follows.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when it is judged that there is no data reception, step S202 follows and a load of the transmission path 2 is checked.
      <br/>
      After that, the processing routine is again returned to step S201.
    </p>
    <p num="35">A load measurement in step S202 is performed as follows in the embodiment.</p>
    <p num="36">
      Namely, a packet of a designated size (for example, 10 bytes) is transmitted plural times (for example, ten times) from the relevant printer to a specific host (not shown, referred to as a host X, hereinbelow) of the designated address on the network through the transmission path 2 in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The host X has been preset so as to return the received data to a printer apparatus of the transmitting source through the transmission path 2.
      <br/>
      A time (TR) which is required until all data is returned to the printer apparatus of the transmitting source after the data was transmitted from the printer apparatus to the host X plural times is measured, thereby measuring the load of the network. (Such measuring means is embodied by a "ping" command in the existing Unix OS.) The measured time (TR) is stored into the RAM 8 in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Such a measurement time (TR) is used as an index to know the load state of the transmission path 2.
      <br/>
      When the time elapses and the load measuring process of the second or subsequent times in step S202 is executed, the measurement time obtained by the preceding load measurement is updated by the measurement time to be obtained at this time, thereby allowing an index notifying the latest load state of the transmission path 2 to be always stored in the RAM 8.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In step S203, a check is made to see if the data reception is continued.
      <br/>
      When it is judged that the data reception is continued, step S204 follows and a check is made to see whether the data reception has been finished or not.
      <br/>
      When data is still being received, the processing routine is returned to step S203.
      <br/>
      When the data reception is finished, step S208 follows and a series of outputting processes such as analysis of the reception data, development of the bit pattern, output of the bit pattern to the printer engine 100, and the like are performed.
      <br/>
      A confirmation of the end of the data reception in step S204 is executed by receiving a data transmission end notification from the host, detecting an EOF (End Of File) added to the last of the reception data, or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="39">On the other hand, when an interruption of the data reception is judged in step S203, step S205 follows and an elapsed time (T) after the start of the interruption of the data reception is monitored and a check is made to see if the elapsed time (T) has reached a predetermined time-out time (TO) or not. In this instance, when T&lt;TO, the processing routine is returned to step S203.</p>
    <p num="40">
      On the contrary, when T &gt;= TO, step S206 follows and a degree of the load of the transmission path 2 is discriminated.
      <br/>
      Such a judgment is performed as follows in the embodiment.
      <br/>
      Namely, with respect to the transmission path load of an ordinary LAN, a mean time (MTR) of the measurement time (TR) which has experientially been known from the load measurement in the past is preset in the ROM 7 or environment memory 13.
      <br/>
      The measurement time (TR) obtained in step S202 and the mean time (MTR) are compared.
      <br/>
      When TR&gt;MTR, it is judged that the load of the transmission path 2 is large.
      <br/>
      When TR &lt;= MTR, it is judged that the load is small.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In step S206, when TR&gt;MTR, step S207 follows.
      <br/>
      The time-out time is prolonged by a predetermined time ( DELTA T) (TO &lt;-- TO+ DELTA T) and the processing routine is returned to the step S203.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, when TR &lt;= MTR, step S208 follows and the outputting process is executed.
      <br/>
      The processing routine is finished.
    </p>
    <p num="42">According to the embodiment, it is possible to control in a manner such that the load of the transmission path is measured and even when the data reception is interrupted and the apparatus reaches the time-out time, in case of a high load, the time-out time is prolonged, thereby subsequently waiting for the data reception.</p>
    <p num="43">
      According to the embodiment of the invention as mentioned above, although the measurement of the load of the transmission path has been executed in the waiting state of the printer (non-data receiving state) and a magnitude of the load has been discriminated by using such a time as it is, the invention is not limited to such a method.
      <br/>
      This point will now be described with reference to flowcharts shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      A construction of FIG. 4 is substantially the same as that of FIG. 3 except that in step S409, after the time-out time, the load of the network is again measured.
      <br/>
      By measuring the load in step S409, a latest state of the data transmission path can be known at a time point of the occurrence of the time-out of data.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      As an operation when the load of the network is measured in step S202 or S409, as shown in a flowchart in FIG. 5, the time (TR) which is required until all data is returned to the printer apparatus of the transmitting source after data was transmitted plural times from the printer apparatus to the host X is measured in step S501.
      <br/>
      After that, a value (TRN) corresponding to the type of the network to which the printer is connected is added to TR in step S502.
      <br/>
      When the network is a high-speed network, TRN is reduced (for example, 0 second).
      <br/>
      When it is a low-speed network, TRN is increased (for example, 30 seconds).
      <br/>
      In step S503, a value (TRD) corresponding to the type of the data is added.
      <br/>
      In case of text data in which a size of data to be transferred is small, TRD is reduced (for example, 0 second) and, in case of image data having a large data size, TRD is increased (for example, 30 seconds).
      <br/>
      By such a method, the value of TR which more accurately corresponds to the state of the network and the data can be obtained and a magnitude of the network load can be more properly judged.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      According to the embodiment, although the judgment of the load of the transmission path has been performed on the basis of the comparison result of the measurement time (TR) and the predetermined mean time (MTR), the invention is not limited to such a method.
      <br/>
      For example, it is also possible to construct in a manner such that the value of the measurement time (TR) to be obtained from the load measurement in step S202 is divided into two or more levels and a magnitude of the load of the transmission path is discriminated by using a plurality of time-out times (for example, 10 seconds, 60 seconds, 120 seconds, . . . ) according to the respective levels.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Although the embodiment has been described with respect to the example in which the switch 302A of the push type is depressed, the switching operation is not limited to only the depression.
      <br/>
      A switch of the touch type or rotary type can be also provided for the operation panel in accordance with the type of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      Not only by operating only one switch 302A but also by simultaneously operating a plurality of switches, the operation information of those switches can be transmitted to the host 300.
    </p>
    <p num="48">Further, it will be obviously understood that it is possible to construct in a manner such that when three or more printer apparatuses of the same type are connected to the LAN and operating conditions of the apparatus which are substantially the same as those of the apparatus B described in the above-mentioned embodiment can be set by commands from the host for each printer apparatus.</p>
    <p num="49">It is also possible to construct in a manner such that when the data reception from the host is interrupted and it is judged that such a situation is caused by an excessive communication load of the transmission load, the extension of the time-out time as in the embodiment is not performed but the processes of the whole apparatus are temporarily stopped until the subsequent data is received and a power supply to unnecessary units of the apparatus excluding a unit for performing the process for waiting for the reception data from the host (sleep mode), thereby reducing an electric power consumption.</p>
    <p num="50">Further, it is also possible to control in a manner such that when the data reception from the host is interrupted, the printer apparatus identifies the type of the host serving as a data transmitting source and the time-out time is changed (extended) on the basis of a processing ability of the identified host or a communication processing ability (maximum data transfer speed) of the host I/F of the printer apparatus.</p>
    <p num="51">
      An embodiment of the invention in which the time-out time is set without measuring the load of the network will now be explained hereinbelow with reference to FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 6, the judgment in step S206 in FIG. 3 is replaced to step S606 and a check is made to see if a network corresponding board has merely been attached on the printer apparatus.
      <br/>
      If YES, the time-out time is extended (S207).
      <br/>
      If NO, the outputting process (S203) is executed by the ordinary time-out time.
      <br/>
      The judgment in step S606 is replaced to a judgment about whether the port (for example, Ethernet) of the interface for the network on the printer apparatus is valid (data can be received) and the port which received the data is the port for the network interface.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to control in a manner such that when the data is received from the network, it is judged that the printer is connected to the network, the time-out time is changed (extended) (S207), and when the data is received from the host without intervening the network, the outputting process (S203) is executed by the ordinary time-out time.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The invention can be applied to a system constructed by a plurality of equipment or can be also applied to an apparatus comprising one equipment.
      <br/>
