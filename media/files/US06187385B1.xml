    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention is directed to waterborne coating compositions containing an aqueous polymer dispersion and a non-polymeric material containing an acetoacetyl group which serves as a coalescing agent and promotes adhesion of the film formed from the coating composition to a substrate.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Background of the Invention</p>
    <p num="5">
      Waterborne coatings comprise particles of polymeric materials dispersed in an aqueous medium.
      <br/>
      When applied to a substrate and dried, the particles coalesce to form films which protect the substrate.
      <br/>
      Certain additives such as coalescing agents or plasticizers are frequently used to promote coalescence of the latex particles in the coating during film formation so that the resulting film has a smooth glossy appearance and completely covers and protects the substrate.
      <br/>
      Other additives are used to improve adhesion of the coating film especially on metal substrates.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,296,226 and 4,421,889 teach that polymers having acetoacetyl pendant groups have improved adhesion to smooth non-absorbent surfaces.
      <br/>
      Further, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,055,511 and 5,120,607 describe the use of acetoacetylated acrylic polymers in mastic caulking compositions.
      <br/>
      Other patents, such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,002,998, EP 390,370, EP 262,720 and EP 326,723, and Japanese Kokai Hei 4 (1992)-164873 describe the use of polymers containing acetoacetoxy groups bound to the polymeric structure. U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,026 describes the use of a polymer containing an acetoacetate group in a coating or impregnating composition.
      <br/>
      The polymer functions to coalesce and crosslink an emulsion polymer. U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,975 describes preparation of polymers containing functional acetoacetate groups which are then reacted with a functional amine to form an enamine.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In all of the above references, the acetoacetoxy group is chemically bound to the polymer which forms the coating.
      <br/>
      This severely limits the chemical nature of the polymeric coating, since the polymer must either be based upon an acetoacetylated copolymerizable monomer or it must contain pendant groups, such as hydroxy or amine, which are capable of reacting with an acetoacetylating agent.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Japanese Patent 3,290,486 describes a process for promoting adhesion to a tin-lead alloy plated steel sheet which involves immersing the sheet in an aqueous acetoacetic acid ester prior to painting.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention provides waterborne coating compositions comprising an aqueous polymer dispersion, an acetoacetate ester, and optional conventional additives.
      <br/>
      The waterborne composition has improved adhesion to substrates, particularly to corroded, oxidized and galvanized metal surfaces.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Another embodiment of this invention includes a method for improving the adhesion of waterborne coating compositions to various substrates, especially to rusty, corroded or galvanized metal.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="11">
      Applicants have unexpectedly found that when a non-polymeric acetoacetate ester is added to waterborne coating compositions, the film resulting from the waterborne coating composition containing the acetoacetate exhibits improved adhesion to a substrate, especially corroded metal substrates.
      <br/>
      The acetoacetate ester may be added to the waterborne coating composition during formulation of the aqueous dispersion polymer or just prior to application of the formulation onto the substrate.
      <br/>
      The acetoacetate ester may be added either neat (pure) or as a solution together with other conventional paint additives, such as coalescing aids, plasticizers, etc.
      <br/>
      The resulting waterborne coating composition has the desirable properties of the latex composition, and in addition, exhibits greatly improved adhesion, especially to corroded metal and oxidized substrates.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Thus, the present invention provides waterborne coating compositions comprising: (A) an aqueous dispersion polymer, (B) an acetoacetate compound of Formula (I):
      <br/>
      (R1 C(.dbd.O)CH2 COO)x R2  (I)
    </p>
    <p num="13">wherein R1 is a C1 -C6 alkyl group, R2 is a C1 -C6 alkyl group or the residue of a polyol and x is an integer of from 1 to 3; and (C) optional, conventional additives.</p>
    <p num="14">Component (A)--Aqueous Dispersion Polymer</p>
    <p num="15">Useful aqueous dispersion polymers may be selected from the group consisting of acrylic latex polymers, vinyl latex polymers and waterborne alkyds.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Preferably, the aqueous dispersion polymer of the present invention is an acrylic latex polymer or vinyl latex polymer formed by polymerization of known monoethylenically unsaturated monomers.
      <br/>
      The term "latex" is used in the conventional meaning to denote stable dispersions of resin particles in a water system.
      <br/>
      Further, the term "polymer" is used to denote a homopolymer or a copolymer.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Suitable polymerizable or copolymerizable monoethylenically unsaturated monomers for the preparation of a latex polymer include, but are not limited to, a monoethylenically unsaturated monomer which may be represented by the general Formula (II):
      <br/>
      CH2.dbd.C(R3)COOR4  (II)
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      where R3 is hydrogen or a C1 -C3 alkyl group, and R4 is a C1 -C20 alkyl group, phenyl, benzyl, hydroxy-(C1 -C4)-alkyl, alkoxy-(C1 -C4)-alkyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, C1 -C4 -alkylfuryl, tetrahydrofuryl, C1 -C4 alkyltetrahydrofuryl and combinations of these monomers thereof.
      <br/>
      Combinations of monomers where R3 is hydrogen and monomers where R3 is an alkyl group are used to modify the glass transition temperature of the latex polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Preferred examples of comonomers are, but are not limited to, methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, propyl (meth)acrylate, isopropyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, isobutyl (meth)acrylate, hexyl (meth)acrylate, isooctyl (meth)acrylate, isodecyl (meth)acrylate, lauryl (meth)acrylate, stearyl (meth)acrylate, phenoxyethyl (meth)acrylate, methoxyethyl (meth)acrylate, benzyl (meth)acrylate, ethoxyethyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)-acrylate, cyclopentyl (meth)acrylate, and isobornyl (meth)acrylate, as well as combinations of those monomers thereof.
      <br/>

      A steel panel rusted by exposure to salt fog was rinsed, then dried and coated to a wet film thickness of 8 mils with a mixture of NEOCRYL.RTM. A650 resin and 15 phr of ethyl acetoacetate.

      A second panel (as a control) was treated in the same way, except that ethylene glycol mono butyl ether was substituted for the ethyl acetoacetate.

      The panels were dried for 72 hours at room temperature, and the adhesion of the coating was evaluated using the Cross-Cut Tape Test described above.
      <br/>
      The panel coated with the ethyl acetoacetate-containing mixture showed 100% retention of the coating.

      A control coating was prepared from 152.3 g AROLON.RTM. 585-W-43 resin, 28.5 g of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, 2.9 g of COBALT HYDROCURE (tm)  drying agent available from OMG/Mooney Chemicals, Inc., 6.0 g of ACTIVE-8 (tm)  drier accelerator available from R. T. Vanterbilt, Inc., and 86.7 g of distilled water.
      <br/>
      This control coating was drawn to a thickness of about 2-3 mils on one of the rusted panels, then cured for 24 hours at 50 (degree)  C. A second rusted panel was similarly coated with a mixture of 10 g of the control coating and 1 g of added ethyl acetoacetate and cured in the same way.
      <br/>
      The adhesion of the coatings was evaluated as previously described.
      <br/>
      The control panel exhibited 10% retention of the control coating; while the panel which had been treated with the ethyl acetoacetate-containing coating exhibited 80-85% coating retention.

      One of the above formulations (control) was drawn down onto each of the two rusty steel panels.
      <br/>
      Ethyl acetoacetate (88.3 g) was blended into the second formulation before it was also drawn down onto two rusty steel plates.
      <br/>
      The plates were allowed to cure for one week at room temperature (22 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      Cross hatch adhesion test on one of each pair of the plates at this point showed no difference between the control and the ethyl acetoacetate-containing coating.
      <br/>
      The remaining pair of plates was then exposed to salt spray for five days.
      <br/>
      The ethyl acetoacetate-containing coating showed much improved adhesion in a repeat of the cross hatch adhesion test.

    <p num="89">Example 10</p>
    <p num="90">Comparative Example</p>
    <p num="91">
      Three rusted steel panels were brushed to remove loose rust.
      <br/>
      One panel was coated with ethyl acetoacetate, allowed to drain and then, while still wet, an 8 mil wet film of RHOPLEX.RTM. AC490 resin was applied.
      <br/>
      The coating did not flow or level well, and the adhesion of the coating after baking at 50 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes was less than 20%.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      A second panel was treated with ethyl acetoacetate and dried in an oven for 30 min at 50 (degree)  C., then coated as before with a film of RHOPLEX.RTM. AC490 resin.
      <br/>
      The film was cured at 50 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes as above.
      <br/>
      Cross hatch adhesion was less than 20% retention of coating.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      The third panel, which was not treated with ethyl acetoacetate, was coated with of RHOPLEX.RTM. AC490 resin and cured as above.
      <br/>
      The cross hatch adhesion test showed 80% retention of the coating.
      <br/>
      This indicates that pretreatment of a substrate with ethyl acetoacetate prior to coating actually interferes with proper adhesion of a latex coating applied to the substrate.
