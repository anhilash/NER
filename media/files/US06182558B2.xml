    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a dual home bagel maker and more particularly pertains to a new bagel making apparatus for making bagels at home either by baking or boiling the dough.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The use of a dual home bagel maker is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a dual home bagel maker heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Known prior art includes U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,526,734; 5,682,809; 5,590,583; U.S. Pat. No. Des. 378,484; U.S. Pat. No. Des. 381,861; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,694,831.</p>
    <p num="6">
      While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not disclose a new bagel making apparatus.
      <br/>
      The inventive device includes a housing having a front side wall, back side wall, a top side, a top wall covering a portion of the top side, end walls, a bottom wall, an opening in the top side, and a baking chamber being disposed therein with the housing further having a water container compartment disposed therein and being accessible through the opening in the top side and with the front side wall having an opening extending therethrough into the baking chamber of the housing; and also includes a lid having a main wall, side walls, and end walls, one of the end walls being hingedly attached to the back side wall with the lid being closeable over the opening in the top side with the lid further having a plurality of apertures being spaced apart and extending through the main wall and further having a handle securely attached to the other of the end walls; and further includes a drawer-like tray support member being slidable into the baking chamber through the opening in the front side wall; and also includes tray members being removably supported upon the drawer-like tray support member; and further includes a heating assembly for heating the baking chamber and the water container compartment for making bagels; and also includes a bagel hole maker for making holes in the bagels.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In these respects, the bagel making apparatus according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of making bagels at home either by baking or boiling the dough.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of dual home bagel maker now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new bagel making apparatus construction wherein the same can be utilized for making bagels at home either by baking or boiling the dough.</p>
    <p num="9">The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new bagel making apparatus which has many of the advantages of the dual home bagel maker mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new bagel making apparatus which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art dual home bagel maker, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="10">To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a housing having a front side wall, back side wall, a top side, a top wall covering a portion of the top side, end walls, a bottom wall, an opening in the top side, and a baking chamber being disposed therein with the housing further having a water container compartment disposed therein and being accessible through the opening in the top side and with the front side wall having an opening extending therethrough into the baking chamber of the housing; and also includes a lid having a main wall, side walls, and end walls, one of the end walls being hingedly attached to the back side wall with the lid being closeable over the opening in the top side with the lid further having a plurality of apertures being spaced apart and extending through the main wall and further having a handle securely attached to the other of the end walls; and further includes a drawer-like tray support member being slidable into the baking chamber through the opening in the front side wall; and also includes tray members being removably supported upon the drawer-like tray support member; and further includes a heating assembly for heating the baking chamber and the water container compartment for making bagels; and also includes a bagel hole maker for making holes in the bagels.</p>
    <p num="11">
      There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.
      <br/>
      There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.
      <br/>
      The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways.
      <br/>
      Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention.
      <br/>
      It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Further, the purpose of the foregoing abstract is to enable the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the public generally, and especially the scientists, engineers and practitioners in the art who are not familiar with patent or legal terms or phraseology, to determine quickly from a cursory inspection the nature and essence of the technical disclosure of the application.
      <br/>
      The abstract is neither intended to define the invention of the application, which is measured by the claims, nor is it intended to be limiting as to the scope of the invention in any way.
    </p>
    <p num="15">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new bagel making apparatus which has many of the advantages of the dual home bagel maker mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new bagel making apparatus which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art dual home bagel maker, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="16">It is another object of the present invention to provide a new bagel making apparatus which may be easily and efficiently manufactured and marketed.</p>
    <p num="17">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new bagel making apparatus which is of a durable and reliable construction.</p>
    <p num="18">An even further object of the present invention is to provide a new bagel making apparatus which is susceptible of a low cost of manufacture with regard to both materials and labor, and which accordingly is then susceptible of low prices of sale to the consuming public, thereby making such bagel making apparatus economically available to the buying public.</p>
