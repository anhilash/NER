    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a two-component developer comprising a magnetic carrier and a magnetic toner.</p>
    <p num="3">
      In general, a two component developer is composed of a non-magnetic toner which does not contain magnetic particles and a magnetic carrier.
      <br/>
      In such a two component developer, toner particles are brought into tribocontact with carrier particles to be charged electrically.
      <br/>
      The toner particles stick to carrier particles electrostatically.
      <br/>
      The carrier particles are transferred on a sleeve to a developing region by magnetic force as they are rolling or dragging magnetically.
      <br/>
      Toner particles are also transferred continuously along with the carrier particles to the developing region.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The toner and the carrier used in the conventional two-component developer have been studied for the improvement of various properties.
      <br/>
      In particular, when the carrier is a binder-type and small in particle size, the toner can be contained at higher content than conventional.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the latitude of toner supply is enlarged and high quality and long life are achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, when the toner particles are not charged uniformly by tribocontact between the toner and the carrier, the charge amount of each toner particle is different.
      <br/>
      This is caused by the different size of toner particles and the electrification build-up properties of toner particles.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, small toner particles which are not charged sufficiently stick to the carrier particles weakly, and liable to leave from the carrier particles as they are rolled to be moved on a sleeve, with the result that the small toner particles come to fly in a copying machine.
      <br/>
      The flying toner particles cause the dirt inside the copying machine, the fogs in copied images and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In general, the wind is blowing whirlingly in the specified direction inside the copying machine for removal of air.
      <br/>
      The flying toner particles are flowed with the wind toward various components.
      <br/>
      For example, the flying toner particles adhere to a wire line of an electric charger.
      <br/>
      If the wire line of the electric charger is made dirt by the adhered toner particles, the irregular charging of a photosensitive member, the defects of copied images and the like are brought about.
      <br/>
      When the dirt makes further progress, a number of toner particles accumulate on a toner-drop-prevention plate.
      <br/>
      The accumulated toner particles drop onto copying paper to make it dirt.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The flying toner particles cause the problems as above mentioned.
      <br/>
      But, these problems are not so serious when a copying process is repeated about 40000 times at low copying speed (about 15 cm/sec).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      But, a high-speed copying process (about 45 cm/sec) has been required recently.
      <br/>
      In such a process, a developer is rolled and moved on a sleeve at much higher speed than before to generate much more flying toner particles.
      <br/>
      The problems caused by the flying toner particles have become more remarkable.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      It is proposed to prevent from generating of flying toner particles, for example, that toner particles are charged smoothly or quickly to adhere strongly to carrier particles.
      <br/>
      But, the toner particles are moved at high speed and the flying toner particles generate inevitably.
      <br/>
      The suppress of the generation of flying toner is not sufficient.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      On the other hand, a magnetic toner is known as one component toner.
      <br/>
      It may be proposed in order to prevent from generating of the flying toner particles that the magnetic properties of the magnetic toner is utilized to attract the toner particles onto a sleeve in a manner similar to carrier particles.
      <br/>
      But, such a conventional magnetic toner contains magnetic particles at the high content of about 30 wt %. Even if the magnetic toner is merely applied to a two-component developer as a toner component, the magnetic toner particles are hard to be transferred to electrostatic latent images and to form copied images with high density.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">The object of the invention is to provide a developer in which toner flying is prevented, electrification build-up properties are excellent, fogs and toner-drop are not brought about, and developing properties are not lowered, even when it is utilized in a high-speed copying process.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">The present invention provides a two-component developer in which toner flying is prevented, electrification build-up properties are excellent, fogs and toner-drop are not brought about, and developing properties are not lowered, even when it is utilized in a high-speed copying process.</p>
    <p num="16">The present invention has accomplished the above object by incorporating magnetic particles into toner particles at a specified content.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The developer of the present invention comprises at least magnetic carrier particles and toner particles containing magnetic particles.
      <br/>
      The carrier particles and toner particles are explained in order hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      With respect to the carrier particles, any type of carrier particles may be applied to the present invention.
      <br/>
      Preferable carrier is composed of at least magnetic particles dispersed in a binder resin.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The binder resin used for preparing the carrier particles is exemplified by a polyester resin of bisphenol type, which is prepared by condensing an alcohol component, such as bisphenol A added with ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, with a carboxylic acid component, such as dicarboxylic acids, tricarboxylic acids or carboxylic acids having C4 -C20 side chains, a polyester resin constituted of ethylene glycol as a main component, a rosin glycidyl ester or the like.
      <br/>
      A styrene-acrylic copolymer may be used as a binder resin.
      <br/>
      Preferable binder resin is the one having the viscosity of 105 -107 cps at 100 (degree)  C. If the viscosity is higher than 107 cps at 100 (degree)  C., it becomes hard to knead the binder resin, and binding properties of the magnetic particles to the resin become poor.
      <br/>
      If the viscosity is lower than 105 cps, the dispersing properties of the magnetic particles is the resin become poor, and the magnetic particles are liable to aggregate together.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      With respect to the magnetic particles, they are not particularly limited in the present invention so far as the electrical resistivity is 107  OMEGA  * cm or more.
      <br/>
      Preferable one is ferrite.
      <br/>
      Concrete examples of ferrite, which are shown in the Japanese Patent KOKOKU No. 57-19055, have the general formula;  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      wherein M' is an atom selected from the group consisting of Ni, Co, Mg, Cu, Zn and Cd; "x" is within the range of between 0.5 and 1.0 and "y" is within the range of between 0.1 and 0.571. Another example of ferrite is the one represented by the formula:
      <br/>
      (MO)x ' * Fe2 O3
    </p>
    <p num="22">in which M is an atom selected from the group consisting of Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Mn, "x'" is an integer of 1, 2 or 3, Magnetite represented by FeO * Fe2 O3, metals containing ferromagnetic metals, such as iron, nickel, cobalt or the like, alloys or compounds of the metals may be used as a magnetic material in the present invention.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The magnetic particles are generally mixed with the binder resin at the ratio of 350-900 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of the binder resin.
      <br/>
      Sufficient magnetization cannot be achieved if the magnetic fine particles are less than 350 parts by weight, and carriers become fragile if the magnetic particles exceed 900 parts by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The carriers of the present invention can be prepared by mixing the binder resins with the magnetic particles sufficiently at the specified mixing ratio to be kneaded, by grinding the obtained mixture after cooling and classifying the resultant.</p>
    <p num="25">
      In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the mean particle size of the carriers are adjusted within the range of between 30-90  MU m in weight average particle size in order to prevent the aggregation of carriers and the adherence thereof to an electrostatic latent image carrier more perfectly.
      <br/>
      The carriers tend to aggregate and adhere to and around the electrostatic latent image carrier and result in the deterioration of the carrier flowability, if the mean particle size of the carriers is less than 30  MU m. Brushing surface irregularity and the like occur as can be similarly seen in iron particle carriers and clean images cannot be formed, if the mean particle size of the carriers is more than 90  MU m. Further, the carriers of the invention may be given;
      <br/>
      (a) the surface treatment by fine particles such as silica, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide, etc.
      <br/>
      (b) the heat treatment in order to modify the surface of the carriers.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Then, the toner particles are explained hereinafter.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The toner particles of the present invention contain at least magnetic particles and a colorant dispersed in a binder resin.
      <br/>
      The magnetic particles may be the same as those described in the carrier particles, being not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      When toner particles are positively charged, preferable magnetic particles are the one represented by (MO)x' * Fe2 O3 in which "M" and "x'" are the same as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="28">The magnetic particles are contained at the content of 0.5-15 parts by weight, preferably 1-10 parts by weight, more preferably 2-6 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of the binder resin of the toner particles.</p>
    <p num="29">
      If the content is less than 0.5 parts by weight, toner flying is not prevented effectively.
      <br/>
      If the content is more than 15 parts by weight, it becomes hard that toner particles are developed effectively.
      <br/>
      That is, the toner particles are not developed onto electrostatic latent images sufficiently and the density of copied images (ID) are lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="30">When the content of the magnetic particles contained in the binder-type carrier is referred to as "a" and the content of the magnetic particles contained in the toner is referred to as "b", the ratio of "a/b" is within the range between about 30-1800.</p>
    <p num="31">The size of magnetic particles contained in toner particles is 0.05-1.0  MU m, preferably 0.05-0.20  MU m, and more preferably 0.05-0.15  MU m in mean particle size when the toner particles are 3-8  MU m in mean particle size.</p>
    <p num="32">Preferable magnetic particles contained in toner particles are spherical.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The photograph of grain structure of spherical fine magnetic particles (which is used in preparing toner 18) ( * 30000) is shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      These particles have 0.11  MU m in mean particle size, and each particle is spherical.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      On the contrary, the photographs of grain structures of polyhedral magnetic particles are shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 shows the magnetic particles used for preparing Toner 1, and FIG. 3 shows the magnetic particles used for preparing Toner 7.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Toner is generally prepared by kneading a binder resin and magnetic particles, and grinding the resultant.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, parts of magnetic particles crop out from the surface of carrier particle.
      <br/>
      When the toner particles are not constituted of spherical magnetic particles but constituted of polyhedral magnetic particles, the toner particles transferred onto a photosensitive member scratch the surface thereof.
      <br/>
      This scratching problem is solved by incorporating spherical magnetic particles into toner particles.
    </p>
    <p num="36">The binder resin used for preparing toner particles is a thermoplastic resin, which is not particularly limited so far as it can be sufficiently softened at fixing temperature and has a glass point suitable for stable preservation.</p>
    <p num="37">
      The binder resin desirable for high speed developing system is the thermoplastic resin having the lowest possible softening point.
      <br/>
      In embodiment, the binder resin has number average molecular weight (Mn), weight average molecular weight (Mw) and Z average molecular weight (Mz) satisfying the relationship below;
      <br/>
      1000 &lt;= Mn &lt;= 7000
      <br/>
      40 &lt;= Mw/Mn &lt;= 70
      <br/>
      200 &lt;= Mz/Mn &lt;= 500.
    </p>
    <p num="38">With regard to the number average molecular weight, more preferable Mn is 2000-7000.</p>
    <p num="39">
      Other kinds of thermoplastic resins, which may have the molecular weight out of the range as above mentioned may be added to improve fixing properties so far as the effects of the present invention are not impaired.
      <br/>
      The kind of such a thermoplastic resin is exemplified by a polystyrene, a copolymer of styrene with acrylic ester or methacrylic ester, a polyester prepared by condensing at least one diol component selected from the one of a bisphenol type or a rosin type with at least one dicarboxylic acid and/or a tricarboxylic acid selected from aromatic dicarboxylic acids, such as o-phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid and the like, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, such as maleic acid, adipic acid and the like, and trimellitic acid.
      <br/>
      The fixing temperature is adequately adjusted in consideration of the softening point of the thermoplastic resin.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The mean molecular weight of the thermoplastic resin (Mn, Mw, Mz) is measured by means of GPC (gel permeation chromatography).
      <br/>
      That is, the solution containing the binder resin dissolved in a solvent is passed through porous gel to separate molecules of high molecular weight and low molecular weight utilizing the different permeation speed passing through the pores.
      <br/>
      The separated molecules are provided for a differential refractometer to calculate the molecular weight on the basis of standard polystyrene.
    </p>
    <p num="41">A colorant employed in the present invention is not particularly limited, but exemplified by carbon black, acetylene black, zinc yellow, cadmium yellow, yellow oxide, mineral fast yellow, chrome orange, molybdenum orange, permanent orange GTR, pyrazolone orange, vulcan orange, red oxide, cadmium red, red lead oxide, cadmium mercury sulfide, permanent red 4R, manganese violet, fast violet B, methyl violet lake, prussian blue, cobalt blue, alkali blue lake, victoria blue lake, phthalocyanine blue, chrome green, chrome oxide, pigment green B, malachite green lake, fanal yellow green, zinc white, titanium oxide, barium carbonate, clay, silica, white carbon and the like.</p>
    <p num="42">
      One or more than two of these colorants can be mixed.
      <br/>
      Other organic or inorganic pigments can be available, if they are pollution-free, and have high coloring power.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Other additives may be incorporated into toner particles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, a charge controlling agent may be incorporated in order to give chargeability.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Examples of charge controlling agent excellent in negative chargeability are hydroxy-substituted naphthoic acid, an alkyl derivative thereof, a hydroxy-substituted tetrahydronaphthoic acid, an alkyl derivative of salicylic acid, a metal complex salt represented by the following general formula;  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="45">
      in which X1 is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group, a nitro group or a halogen atom; n1 is an integer of 1 or 2, and m1 is an integer of 1, 2 or 3.
      <br/>
      X may be same; M1 is a chromium atom or a cobalt atom; A+ is a hydrogen ion, a sodium ion, a potassium ion or an ammonium ion; a metal complex salt represented by the following general formula:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="46">or a metal complex salts represented by the following general formula:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="47">
      in which X2 and X3 are a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group, a nitro group or a halogen atom respectively; X2 and X3 may be same; m2 and m3 are an integer of 1, 2 or 3 respectively; R1 and R2 are a hologen atom respectively; R1 and R2 may be same; n2 and n3 are an integer of 1, 2 or 3 respectively; R2 and R4 are a hydrogen atom or a nitro group respectively; M2 is a chromium atom or a cobalt atom; K+ is a hydrogen atom, a sodium ion or an ammonium ion.
      <br/>
      Further, 2-acrylamide-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid is copolymerized with styrene etc. to use as a charge controlling agent in combination with the charge controlling agent as above mentioned, with the result that the electrification build-up properties are improved and toner-flying can be suppressed.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Electron-donating dyes, such as nigrosine dyes, are generally used as a charge controlling agent effective for positive chargeability.
      <br/>
      Other examples are alkoxylated amine, quarternary ammonium salt, alkyl amide, phosphorous itself or a compound thereof, tungsten itself or compound thereof, a pigment chelated with molybdic acid, dibutyl tin oxide or a nitrogen-containing compound, which may be used singly or in combination.
    </p>
    <p num="49">Copolymers of vinyl monomers containing an amino group, such as dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate or diethylaminoethyl methacrylate with styrene may be used in combination with the charge controlling agent as above mentioned, with the result that the electrification build-up properties are improved and toner-flying can be suppressed.</p>
    <p num="50">
      Further, other additives, such as wax may be added into the toner of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The surface of toner particles may be treated with ultrafine particles of metal oxides.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The binder resin, colorants, magnetic particles, other necessary additives are mixed to prepare a toner of the present invention by an usual method, such as a grinding method, so-called suspension polymerization method in which materials other than main resin are dispersed in monomer and then the materials are incorporated into the binder resin when the monomer is polymerized, a granulating method in which a spray drier is used.
      <br/>
      Other methods of preparing toner particles may be used.
      <br/>
      The size of toner particles are adjusted within the range of 3-20  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The obtained toner is mixed at the content of 4-15 wt % on the basis of the total amount of the toner and carrier to prepare a developer.
      <br/>
      The developer contains toner particles at high content.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the latitude of toner supply is enlarged.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The developer of the present invention does not bring about various problems caused by toner flying even when it is used in high developing system (30-50 cm/sec).
