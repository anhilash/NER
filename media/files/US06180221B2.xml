    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to electrically conductive devices and, more particularly, to an electrically conductive elastomer for grafting to thermoplastic and thermoset substrates.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The electronic circuitry for most present day electronic products is typically provided on circuit boards.
      <br/>
      Most circuit boards are fabricated of thermoset materials such as, for example, FR4 (tm) , which contains epoxy and glass fibers.
      <br/>
      It is because of these constituent elements that thermoset materials have rigid properties.
      <br/>
      Such rigid properties are required for many applications wherein electronic circuitry is utilized.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A circuit board typically has electrically conductive traces formed thereon for making electrical connections between electronic devices mounted on the circuit board.
      <br/>
      These electrically conductive traces are typically formed by an etching process wherein a copper alloy material is applied to a surface of the circuit board, and then portions of the copper alloy material is etched away, thereby leaving the remaining copper alloy material to act as the electrically conductive traces.
      <br/>
      This etching process is typically time and labor intensive.
      <br/>
      Also, the electrically conductive traces often break when the circuit board is flexed or becomes warped due to changing thermal and/or moisture conditions.
      <br/>
      Thus, it would be beneficial to provide a material which may be used to form electrically conductive traces on a circuit board that is easily applied and can flexibly withstand most environmental conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Electronic circuitry can also be provided on flex film circuits.
      <br/>
      Such flex film circuits are typically fabricated of thermoplastic materials such as, for example, KAPTON (tm) , which contains resin fibers.
      <br/>
      These resin fibers give the flex film circuits their flexible qualities.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A flex film circuit is typically fabricated by laminating at least one electrically conductive copper alloy trace between two sheets of a thermoplastic film such as, for example, KAPTON (tm) . An adhesive is often used to insure that the two sheets of the film remain secured together.
      <br/>
      This lamination process involves several steps and requires precise alignment of the sheets of thermoplastic film and the electrically conductive copper alloy traces as there are typically openings in the sheets of thermoplastic film to allow access to the electrically conductive copper alloy traces.
      <br/>
      Also, it is often the case that the electrically conductive traces will fracture after repeated flexing of the flex film circuit.
      <br/>
      Thus, it would be beneficial to provide a material which may be used to form electrically conductive traces on a flex film circuit that is easily applied and can withstand repeated flexing of the flex film circuit.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a perspective view of a circuit board 10 having a plurality of electrically conductive contact pads 11 for making electrical connections with terminals 13 on several corresponding surface mount integrated circuit components 12.
      <br/>
      The electrically conductive contact pads 11 are electrically interconnected with electrically conductive traces 14 (only one shown for illustrative purposes).
      <br/>
      The electrically conductive contact pads 11 and the electrically conductive traces 14 are formed with an electrically conductive elastomer material which is grafted directly to the circuit board 10.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The circuit board 10 may be fabricated of one of many different types of thermoset materials such as, for example, FR4 (tm) . The electrically conductive elastomer material is grafted directly to the thermoset material of the circuit board 10 so as to form the electrically conductive contact pads 11 and the electrically conductive traces 14.
      <br/>
      Electrical connections between the electrically conductive contact pads 11 and the terminals 13 on the surface mount integrated circuit components 12 may be made by simply by forcing the terminals 13 on the surface mount integrated circuit components 12 against the electrically conductive contact pads 11.
      <br/>
      The electrically conductive traces 14 provide electrical interconnections between the electrically conductive contact pads 11, and hence between the surface mount integrated circuit components 12.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The electrically conductive elastomer material comprises a mixture of an elastic material, a quantity of electrically conductive flakes, a thermoplastic elastomer material, and a thermoset material.
      <br/>
      The elastic material may be any one of a variety of elastic materials such as, for example, silicone rubber or fluorosilicone rubber.
      <br/>
      The conductive flakes may be fabricated of many different types of conductive or semiconductive materials such as, for example, silver, nickel, or carbon.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the conductive flakes may be fabricated of many different types of conductive, semiconductive, or insulative materials which are coated with or have interspersed therein other conductive or semiconductive materials such as, for example, silver, nickel, or carbon.
      <br/>
      The size of the conductive flakes may vary depending on the level of conductivity that is required and the size of the electrically conductive contact pads 11 and the electrically conductive traces 14.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The thermoplastic elastomer material may be any one of a variety of thermoplastic elastomers such as, for example, VITON (tm) . The thermoplastic elastomer material provides a bridging function between the elastic material and the thermoset material in the electrically conductive elastomer material.
      <br/>
      That is, as described in more detail below, polymer chains in the thermoplastic elastomer material are grafted to polymer chains in the elastic material and the thermoset material when electrically conductive elastomer material is grafted to the circuit board 10.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Assuming that the circuit board 10 is fabricated of the thermoset material FR4 (tm) , which comprises epoxy and glass fibers, the thermoset material is also FR4 (tm) . This relationship between the type of thermoset material in the electrically conductive elastomer material and the material type of the circuit board 10 insures that a strong chemical bond will form between the electrically conductive elastomer material and the circuit board 10 when the electrically conductive elastomer material is grafted to the circuit board 10.
      <br/>
      That is, as described in more detail below, polymer chains in the thermoset material of the electrically conductive elastomer material are grafted to polymer chains in the thermoset material of the circuit board 10 when the electrically conductive elastomer material is grafted to the circuit board 10.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The electrically conductive elastomer material is grafted to the circuit board 10 by a thermal grafting process which typically begins by providing the circuit board 10 in a fully cured state.
      <br/>
      The electrically conductive elastomer material is deposited on the circuit board 10 in an uncured state by spray coating, roller coating, transfer pad printing, or any of a variety of other known methods.
      <br/>
      The circuit board 10 and the electrically conductive elastomer material are then subjected to a thermal cycle whereby the electrically conductive elastomer material is fully cured and grafted to the circuit board 10.
      <br/>
      During this thermal grafting process, polymer chains in the electrically conductive elastomer material are grafted to polymer chains in the circuit board 10 so as to form a strong chemical bond between the electrically conductive elastomer material and the circuit board 10.
      <br/>
      In the uncured state, the elastic material, the conductive flakes, the thermoplastic elastomer material, and the thermoset material are typically suspended in a solvent, for example, TOLUENE (tm) , which evaporates during the thermal cycle.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the grafting process may alternatively involve irradiation or compressive bonding to fully cure and graft the electrically conductive elastomer material to the circuit board 10.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The conductive flakes in the electrically conductive elastomer material provide low resistivity even when the electrically conductive elastomer material is being deformed through expansion or compression since the surface area of the conductive flakes is large enough for electrical contact to be made between adjacent conductive flakes when such deformities occur.
      <br/>
      For instance, during lengthwise expansion of the electrically conductive elastomer material, the length of the electrically conductive elastomer material is increased while the thickness of the electrically conductive elastomer material is decreased.
      <br/>
      The decrease in thickness brings adjacent conductive flakes closer together, thereby increasing the likelihood that the large surface areas of adjacent conductive flakes will come into physical, and hence electrical, contact with each other.
      <br/>
      The increase in length results in lateral movement of the conductive flakes, thereby causing the large surface areas of adjacent conductive flakes to rub or scrape against each other so that physical, and hence electrical, contact between adjacent conductive flakes is maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The durometer rating of the electrically conductive elastomer material typically ranges between 40 and 80 on the Shore A scale.
      <br/>
      Such a durometer rating allows the electrically conductive elastomer material to be expanded or compressed to at least 33% of its at-rest shape.
      <br/>
      When such a deformation occurs, the conductive flakes interspersed in the electrically conductive elastomer material interact as described above so as to maintain a low resistivity throughout the electrically conductive elastomer material.
      <br/>
      An electrically conductive elastomer material that has been grafted to a circuit board in accordance with the present invention has been shown to maintain a resistance in the range of 20-30 mohms during measurements performed while deforming the electrically conductive elastomer material within the above-described limits.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      At this point it should be noted that although the circuit board 10 has been shown above with corresponding leadless surface mount integrated circuit components 12, it is also possible to utilize the present invention in an environment where discrete or otherwise leaded components are used.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, although only a single layered circuit board 10 has been shown above, it is also possible to utilize the present invention on multilayer circuit boards.

    <p num="21">
      In an alternative embodiment, the above-described electrically conductive elastomer material could be used in conjunction with a flex film circuit.

      The electrically conductive traces 104 provide electrical interconnections between the electrically conductive contact pads 102.
