      A weather head electrical connection box enables electrical connection to a home or business without the need for splicing.
      <br/>
      The box contains three splice blocks which have two sets of orifices equipped with set screws, a first set for the power feed and the second for the service entrance cable from the customer's building.
      <br/>
      These connector blocks are of conductive material and transmit power from the in feed to the service entrance cable without the need for splicing.
      <br/>
      The connection box is provided with a removable cover that may be provided with a pivot finger that engages in a slot secured to the bottom of the box and may be closed by a wire to restrict access to the box.
      <br/>
      The housing may be alternatively attached to the top of a service pipe that extends above the roof or to the side of a house.

    <p num="1">
      The present invention is directed to an electrical connection box commonly referred to as a "weather head".
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention is directed to a weather head connection box in which power connections can be quickly, easily and reliably made.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      One of the prevailing practices in the housing industry for making electrical connection through a weather head is to unjacket two feet of service entrance cable and run it through the weather head connection box.
      <br/>
      When the workman from the electric company runs the power feed from the road to the house or business, s/he has to splice the three wires (two positive, and one ground) from the power feed to the local service leads at an approximate cost of $12.00.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The weather head connection box of the present invention proposes to eliminate the need for splicing.
      <br/>
      The three leads from the service entrance cable wire can be inserted into a first set of orifices in three junction blocks and secured by set screws.
      <br/>
      When service is brought from the street, the three power feeders can be inserted into three sister orifices in the three junction blocks and secured by a second set of set screws.
      <br/>
      The three junction blocks are conductive metallic L-shaped blocks, preferably compatible with copper and aluminum, isolated from one another and designed to make reliable connection between the power feeders and the service leads.
      <br/>
      A cover, which has a pivot arm on the lid which can drop into a slotted arm on the box, protects the junction blocks from weather and can be subsequently sealed by the local utility company using a twist tie wire.
      <br/>
      The weather head connection box can be provided with two adaptors, one of which will enable the box to be attached to the top of a 2" PVC stack and to a 2-2 1/2" galvanized pipe, the two types of stacks prevailing in the industry, and the other adaptor which clamps to a service entrance cable running to the electric meter.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Various other features, advantages and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art after a reading of the following specification.</p>

    </p>
    <p num="6">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</p>
    <p num="7">
      FIGS. 1 and 2 depict two common ways weather heads are used to make electrical connection to residential and business customers' facilities.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, the ground wire 13 of the power feed 11 from the street is connected to a clevis 15 on service pipe 17.
      <br/>
      A ground cable 19 is connected inside of weather head box 21, as are the two positive cables 23 and 25.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, weather head connection box 21 is attached to the side of house 9 and service entrance cable 10 connects the power feed 11 from the street to the electric meter 12.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      A first preferred embodiment of the weather head connection box of the present invention is shown in FIG. 3 generally at 20.
      <br/>
      Weather head connection box 20 could be metallic but is more preferably made of a durable plastic material.
      <br/>
      The box 20 includes generally rectangular housing 20A which is generally C-shaped in cross section with a first back side 22 and an open second front side 24 that can be closed by a removable cover 40 (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Third lateral side 27 and fourth lateral side 29, along with top 26 and bottom 28, complete the enclosure formed by housing 20A.
      <br/>
      Back side 22 has an elongated opening 32 facilitating attachment to the side of a house, or the like.
      <br/>
      Such an attachment will be utilized when weather head connection box 20 is connected directly to a service entrance cable 10 (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      It should be noted that such attachment is optional; connection box 20 can simply sit atop the service pipe 17 (FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      Box 20 is coupled to service cable 10 using clamp 30 with its associated threaded collar 38 which threads into a cylindrical opening 34 in bottom 28.
      <br/>
      Service pipes 17 generally have one of three forms: 2" pvc pipe, 2" galvanized pipe, or 21/2" galvanized pipe.
      <br/>
      Adaptor 36 (FIG. 7) can be provided to facilitate the connection between service pipe 17 and box 20 using a set screw 37 regardless of the size of the pipe.
      <br/>
      The embodiment shown in FIG. 7 has a thin-walled bottom 28 so rather than thread into it, a simple nut 13 can be threaded on the top 38 of adaptor 36 to secure the box 20 thereto.
      <br/>
      As an additional alternative, a threaded metal grommet (not shown) could have the thicker bottom 28 molded into it, providing better pull out resistance than the threads in the plastic bottom 28.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Three junction blocks 42, 44, 46 are affixed to the inner surface of first side 22 by an adhesive or using plastic screws.
      <br/>
      Junction blocks 42, 44, 46 are made of electrically conductive materials that are compatible with both aluminum and copper.
      <br/>
      Such materials include aluminum, copper and some steels.
      <br/>
      If connection box 20 is made of metal, a layer of elastomer or insulative foam will be disposed between back side 22 and junction blocks 42, 44, 46.
      <br/>
      Junction blocks 42, 44, 46 are isolated from one another by positioning a layer of insulative foam 43 between blocks 42 and 44 and another layer 45 between blocks 44 and 46.
      <br/>
      Junction blocks 42, 44, 46 are identical L-shaped members each with a first orifice 48 extending axially through the long arm 50 of the L and a second orifice 52 extending transversely through the short arm 54.
      <br/>
      A first set screw 56 is threaded transversely through long arm 50 to extend into first orifice 48 and a second set screw 58 is threaded axially into short arm 54 to extend into second orifice 52.

      Connection box 20 is attached to the top of service pipe 17 using adaptor 36 and attachment nut 13, or alternatively, to service cable 10 using clamp 30 with box 20 being threaded onto collar 38.
      <br/>
      Service entrance cable 10, has two positive wires 23' and 25' and a ground cable 19'. A length of several inches of each of wires 23' and 25' is unjacketed and wire 23' is threaded through orifice 48 in block 42 and secured therein by set screw 56.
      <br/>
      Similarly, second positive wire 25' and ground 19' are threaded through orifices 48 in blocks 46 and 44, respectively, and secured therein by set screws 56.
      <br/>
      A pair of protrusions 41 on cover 40 are received in recesses in top 26.
      <br/>
      A pivot finger 55 on the cover 40 can be engaged in a slot in arm 57 attached to bottom 28 to extend outwardly past open front side 24.
      <br/>
      A wire 61 can be inserted through a hole 59 in pivot finger 55 so the electric company can restrict access to the box 20 for safety reasons.
    </p>
    <p num="11">When construction of the house or place of business is sufficiently complete, the power company's representative can make the electrical service connection by simply removing cover 40, running the power feed including two positive wires 23 and 25 and a ground 19 into the bottom 28 of box 20 through the apertures 31, 33 and 35 (FIG. 5) provided therefore, and threading those wires into orifices 52 in the front portion of blocks 42, 44, 46, respectively, using set screws 58 to secure those wires therein.</p>
    <p num="12">The weather head connection box 20 of the present invention enables electrical connection to be more quickly, easily and reliably made than has previously been possible without the need for splicing or unjacketing as much cable as has heretofore been necessary.</p>
