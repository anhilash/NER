    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to new microorganisms, to a method for preparing them and also to their use.
      <br/>
      More especially, the invention relates to microorganisms that produce antibiotics.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Of the many antibiotics described in the prior art, some possess the feature of consisting of several active components acting together synergistically.
      <br/>
      This is the case, in particular, with the antibiotics of the streptogramin family, which are composed of a macrolactone (group A component) and a depsipeptide (group B component).
      <br/>
      The antimicrobial activity and the mode of action of these antibiotics have been the subject of studies, in particular by Tanaka (Antibiotics, vol.
      <br/>
      III p. 487, Springer, Berlin (1975)) and Vasquez (Antibiotics, vol.
      <br/>
      III p. 521, Springer, Berlin (1975)).
      <br/>
      The general structure of the molecules of groups A and B is shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Among the known antibiotics of the streptogramin family, there may be mentioned, more especially:</p>
    <p num="5">
      pristinamycins,
      <br/>
      mikamycins,
      <br/>
      virginiamycins,
      <br/>
      vernamycins,
      <br/>
      ostreogrycins,
      <br/>
      synergistins,
      <br/>
      plauracins,
      <br/>
      etamycins,
      <br/>
      streptogramins,
      <br/>
      viridogriseins,
      <br/>
      griseoviridins, or
      <br/>
      neoviridogriseins.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The active form of each of these antibiotics consists of a synergistic combination of molecules belonging to group A as shown in FIG. 1 and molecules belonging to group B as shown in FIG. 2, or of related molecules.</p>
    <p num="7">Related molecules are understood, in the sense used in the present invention, to mean molecules possessing the general skeleton of those shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 but which may differ from the latter by substitutions or other secondary variations, and possessing an activity of the same nature.</p>
    <p num="8">
      The antibiotics of the streptogramin family are produced by a wide variety of microorganisms, and especially by bacteria of the genus Actinomycete and by certain fungi.
      <br/>
      These microorganisms are characterised in that they synthesise both components A and B simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Table 1 lists the main productive microorganisms, together with the corresponding antibiotics.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Studies have been carried out with the object of increasing the levels of production of these microorganisms.
      <br/>
      There may be mentioned, in particular, the works of Biot (Biotechnology of Industrial Antibiotics, vol. 22 (1984) p. 695) or of Prikrylova et al. (Biotechnology and Bioindustry/2 (1988) 20) concerning improvement in the culture conditions and the effect of mutagenic agents on the levels of production of virginiamycin by S. virginiae.
      <br/>
      As the authors state, the overproductive mutants obtained always produce components A and B simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p num="11">However, the fact that the streptogramin-producing microorganisms which are available in the prior art synthesise both synergistic components A and B of the antibiotic simultaneously, in the same fermentation medium, constitutes a considerable drawback in some cases.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In effect, to optimise the use of these antibiotics and to be able to use them as pharmaceutical agents, it is preferable to be able to separate and purify the A and B components of the streptogramins.
      <br/>
      This is also essential in order to be able to carry out chemical studies on streptogramins, especially with the object of preparing semisynthetic derivatives such as, for example, those described in Patents FR 2,549,063, FR 2,549,065, EP 191,662 or EP 248,703.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      However, accessibility to these different components is difficult as a result, in particular, of their simultaneous production and of the similarity of their physicochemical properties.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, these microorganisms generally synthesise several different molecules of each component, leading to a mixture of many compounds, in highly variable proportions, in the fermentation must.
      <br/>
      In effect, many molecules belonging to groups A and B of streptogramins, possessing very different biological activities and which are produced simultaneously by the microorganisms, are known at the present time.
      <br/>
      Thus, the following molecules belonging to group A are known in the prior art: pristinamycins PIIA and PIIB, virginiamycins M1 and M2, mikamycin A or ostreogrycins A and G. Likewise, the following molecules belonging to group B are known in the prior art: pristinamycins PIA, PIB and PIC, virginiamycins S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5, mikamycin B, vernamycins B ALPHA , B BETA , B GAMMA  and B DELTA , ostreogrycin B, B1, B2 and B3 or neoviridogriseins I, II, III and IV.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      For these reasons, it is difficult to obtain active and pharmaceutically acceptable synergistic mixtures of streptogramins satisfactorily at industrial level.
      <br/>
      It is also difficult to carry out chemical studies on streptogramins (structure-function relationship, development of water-soluble forms, and the like).
      <br/>
      The present invention enables the drawbacks of the prior art in this field to be remedied.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The Applicant has now shown that it is possible to obtain microorganisms that produce components A and B of streptogramins separately in a stable manner.
      <br/>
      The Applicant has hence developed, and this constitutes a subject of the present invention, microorganisms capable of selectively producing components A and B of streptogramins.
      <br/>
      The invention relates both to microorganisms capable of selectively producing molecules of group A of streptogramins or molecules of group B of streptogramins, and to microorganisms capable of selectively producing a molecule specific to one of these groups.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The invention thus makes possible the separate production of streptogramin A or B in large quantities.</p>
    <p num="17">The invention also makes it possible to use methods for purification of streptogramins which are simpler and hence more efficacious and more economical, since there are no longer, or are fewer, interactions between the different components during the extraction.</p>
    <p num="18">The invention also makes it possible to vary the respective quantities of components A and B in a mixture, and hence to produce antibiotic compositions which are optimal in respect of both purity and synergistic efficiency.</p>
    <p num="19">The invention also makes it possible to obtain products in sufficient quantity and purity to carry out chemical studies in order to improve further the properties of streptogramins.</p>
    <p num="20">The invention thus provides a system for production of streptogramins that permits a much more efficacious industrial exploitation of these antibiotics.</p>
    <p num="21">More especially, the invention relates to microorganisms capable of selectively producing components A and B of streptogramins chosen from the group comprising pristinamycin, virginiamycin, mikamycin, ostreogrycin, synergistin, viridogrisein, vernamycin, plauracin, etamycin, griseoviridin, neoviridogrisein and streptogramin.</p>

    </p>
    <p num="27">Preferably, the microorganisms of the invention are essentially bacteria of the genus Actinomycete or fungi.</p>
    <p num="28">Still more preferably, the microorganisms of the invention belong to the genus Streptomyces.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The microorganisms of the invention may be cultured under standard aerobic fermentation conditions.
      <br/>
      In particular, the nutrient medium generally consists of a carbon source, a nitrogen source and mineral salts.
      <br/>
      As a carbon source, sugars, oils, organic acids, dextrin, starches, glycerol, and the like, may be used in particular.
      <br/>
      As a nitrogen source, there may be mentioned amino acids, extracts (malt, soya bean, cotton seed, tomato, maize, and the like), and plant meal, viscera, miscellaneous hydrolysates (casein, yeast, and the like) and industrial byproducts such as "distillers solubles".
      <br/>
      As a mineral source, it is possible to use sodium, potassium, ammonium or calcium chlorides, nitrates, carbonates, sulphates and phosphates, or trace elements such as magnesium, iron, copper, zinc, manganese or cobalt.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The microorganisms of the present invention are preferably obtained from microorganisms that are non-selective producers of streptogramins.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Non-selective microorganisms are understood, in the sense used in the present invention, to mean microorganisms which synthesize components A and B of streptogramins simultaneously.
      <br/>
      All the microorganisms listed in Table 1 constitute non-selective microorganisms in the sense used in the invention.
      <br/>
      The Applicant has now shown that microorganisms that are selective producers of streptogramins may be obtained from non-selective microorganisms that produce streptogramins.
      <br/>
      To this end, a novel process has been developed, involving a first, optional step of mutagenesis followed by a selection step.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Another subject of the present invention hence relates to a method for preparing the microorganisms defined above, according to which the following steps are carried out:
      <br/>
      in a first, optional step, a mutagenesis is performed on a microorganism that is a non-selective producer of streptogramins, and
      <br/>
      in a second step, the selective microorganisms are selected.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      As stated above, the non-selective microorganisms generally belong to the group comprising Actinomycetes and fungi.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the starting microorganisms which can be used in the method of the invention are microorganisms that are non-selective producers of a streptogramin chosen from the group comprising pristinamycin, virginiamycin, mikamycin, ostreogrycin, synergistin, viridogrisein, vernamycin, plauracin, etamycin, neoviridogrisein, griseoviridin and streptogramin.
      <br/>
      As an example, the microorganisms listed in Table 1 constitute non-selective microorganisms which can be used in the method of the invention.
      <br/>
      Still more preferably, the method of the invention is carried out using microorganisms chosen from Streptomyces alborectus, Streptomyces diastaticus, Streptomyces graminofaciens, Streptomyces griseus, Streptomyces loidensis, Streptomyces mitakaensis, Streptomyces olivaceus, Streptomyces ostreogriseus, Streptomyces pristinaespiralis, Streptomyces virginiae, Streptomyces lavendulae, Streptomyces griseoviridus, Micromonospora sp., Actinomyces auranticolor, Actinomyces daghestanicus and Actinomyces azureus.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Still more preferably, the method of the invention is carried out using microorganisms chosen from Streptomyces alborectus, Streptomyces mitakaensis, Streptomyces pristinaespiralis, Streptomyces ostreogriseus and Streptomyces virginiae.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The first step of the method consists in modifying the non-selective microorganism so as to increase its overall capacity for production of antibiotic, and/or so that it synthesises only one of the 2 components of streptogramins.
      <br/>
      This may be obtained by genetic modifications (mutation at structural genes for enzymes involved in the pathway of biosynthesis, or at sequences permitting the expression of such structural genes, for example) or biochemical modifications (modification of a post-translational mechanism, alteration of a feedback-inhibition mechanism, and the like).
      <br/>
      To this end, various tools of mutagenesis may be used, and in particular:
      <br/>
      physical agents: X-rays, ultraviolet rays; or
      <br/>
      chemical agents such as:
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      - alkylating agents such as ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (Delic et al.
      <br/>
      Mutation Res. 9 (1970) 167-182) or 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (NQO);
      <br/>
      - bialkylating agents;
      <br/>
      - intercalating agents; or
      <br/>

      Each of these tools may be applied to the non-selective microorganisms in the state of spores or of spores which have germinated or are in the course of germination, or to mycelium.
      <br/>
      Moreover, these various tools may also be used in combination.

    <p num="38">
      Although some preferred mutational schemes may be set out, leading to the formation of the desired selective microorganisms, it is understood that the mutagenesis step may be adapted by a person skilled in the art in accordance with the starting microorganism used, the streptogramin desired and the objectives set (increase in the rate of synthesis of the desired component, increase in the level of production of the latter, reduction in the consumption of starting materials by the microorganism, and the like).
      <br/>
      Under these conditions, the present invention is not limited to a precise mutational scheme, but extends to all manipulations (random or directed) that enable microorganisms capable of selectively producing one component of streptogramins from non-selective microorganisms to be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="39">As a specific example, mutagenesis in the presence of ethyl methanesulphonate or by treatment with UV gives good results.</p>
    <p num="40">
      As regards the second step of the method, this enables the selective microorganisms to be identified and isolated.
      <br/>
      This step may be carried out in different ways, and in particular by means of a sensitivity test with respect to a microbe.
      <br/>
      To this end, different microbes specifically sensitive to the components of group A or to those of group B of streptogramins exist.
      <br/>
      There may be mentioned, in particular, the Bacillus subtilis (ATCC6633), Bacillus circulans, Bacillus cereus (Watanabe, J. Antibio, Ser.
      <br/>
      A XIII(1) (1960) 62) or C. xerosis (Watanabe, loc. cit.), which are specifically sensitive to the components of group B. There may also be mentioned Streptococcus agalactiae B96 (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 10(5) (1976) 795), Micrococcus luteus (Prikrylova, loc. cit.) or Sarcina lutea (ATCC9341), which are specifically sensitive to the components of group A. Moreover, it is also possible to prepare artificially microbes that are specifically sensitive to one component of streptogramins, by inserting a gene for resistance to one of the components of streptogramins into a microbe that is sensitive to both components.
      <br/>
      Some of these genes have, in effect, been cloned (Le Goffic et al., J. Antibio. XXX(8) (1977) 665; Le Goffic et al., Ann. Microbiol. Inst. Pasteur 128B (1977) 471; Solh et al., Path. Biol. 32(5) (1984) 362), and a person skilled in the art can introduce such genes into different microbes using standard techniques of molecular biology.
      <br/>
      The selection step may also be performed by an ELISA test using antibodies specific for components A or B, or alternatively by analytical techniques such as chromatography (liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, and the like).
      <br/>
      In the case of a sensitivity test with respect to a microbe, it is, in addition, preferable to validate the selection by chromatographic assay.

      <br/>
      Components A and B of streptogramins may be separated from the fermentation must by standard methods of solvent extraction.

      It is, in particular, possible to work according to the following protocol: filtration of the must after acidification to approximately pH 3, neutralization of the filtrate to pH 7, extraction with dichloroethane, concentration and precipitation of the component produced by a poor solvent such as petroleum ether.

    <p num="51">This example was carried out without a prior step of mutagenesis.</p>
    <p num="52">1. Selection by sensitivity to a microbe.</p>
    <p num="53">
      A suspension of S. pristinaespiralis DS5647 (ATCC25486) spores is plated out after dilution on complete agar medium (HT medium: white dextrin 10 g; N-Z-amine type A 2 g; yeast extract 1 g; meat extract 1 g; CoC12.6H2O 0.02 g; bacto agar 20 g; demineralized water q.s. 1 l: see Pridham, Antibiotic Annual (1956) 957) so as to have isolated colonies.
      <br/>
      After a growth step, these isolated colonies are subcultured on production medium (HT medium).
      <br/>
      At a defined age, plugs are withdrawn from the medium in order to assay the pristinamycins produced.
    </p>
    <p num="54">1.1. Assay of pristinamycins PI.</p>
    <p num="55">
      A portion of the plugs withdrawn is deposited on agar medium �25 g/l of Merieux medium No. 2 (Merieux 5 177 1), 20 g/l of NaCl, 5 g/l of TAPS buffer, pH 8.5� with the addition of 40 mg/l of pristinamycin PII and which is inoculated with 3.6 * 108 sp/l of Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633.
      <br/>
      This medium is prepared in the following manner on the day the plugs are withdrawn: the agar medium, distributed in 200-ml Erlenmeyers, is melted using microwaves, and the temperature of the flask contents is then brought down to approximately 50 (degree)  C. in a water bath and then monitored under a hood with a thermometer dipping into the medium while stirring gently.

      When a temperature of 48 (degree)  C. is reached, the following are added to the contents of each flask:
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      2 ml of a solution of pristinamycin PII at a concentration of 4 mg/ml (final concentration 40 mg/l), and

    <p num="58">After deposition of the plugs on the plates (diameter of the plug borer: 4.0 mm), a prediffusion of 6 hours at 4 (degree)  C. is performed, and the plates are then incubated for 16 hours at 37 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="59">1.2. Assay of pristinamycins PII.</p>
    <p num="60">
      A portion of the plugs withdrawn is deposited on agar medium �52 g/l of Brain Heart infusion agar� with the addition of 10 mg/l of pristinamycin PI and which is inoculated with 5 * 108 sp/l of Streptococcus agalactiae B96.

    <p num="63">1.3. Results</p>
    <p num="64">
      The diameters of the inhibition halos are measured for each of the plates containing the test microbes.
      <br/>
      They are dependent on the concentration of antibiotic (component A or B) present in the medium, and hence enable the clones that do not produce one or other of the components to be identified.
    </p>
    <p num="65">Of 3600 clones tested, 36 not producing pristinamycin PI were identified in this way.</p>
    <p num="66">2. Selection by chromatographic assay.</p>
    <p num="67">
      The clones thus identified not producing pristinamycin PI but producing pristinamycin PII in a solid medium were then tested in a liquid medium.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, 0.5 ml of a suspension of spores of the strains selected in 1. is added under sterile conditions to 40 ml of inoculum medium in a 300-ml Erlenmeyer.
      <br/>
      The inoculum medium consists of 10 g/l of corn steep, 15 g/l of sucrose, 10 g/l of (NH4)2SO4, 1 g/l of K2HPO4, 3 g/l of NaCl, 0.2 g/l of MgSO4.7H2O and 1.25 g/l of CaCO3.
      <br/>
      The pH is adjusted to 6.9 with sodium hydroxide before introduction of the calcium carbonate. the Erlenmeyers are stirred for 44 hours at 27 (degree)  C. on a rotary stirrer at a speed of 325 rpm. 2.5 ml of the above culture 44 hours old are added under sterile conditions to 30 ml of production medium in a 300-ml Erlenmeyer.
      <br/>
      The production medium consists of 25 g/l of soya bean meal, 7.5 g/l of starch, 22.5 g/l of glucose, 3.5 g/l of seeding yeast, 0.5 g/l of zinc sulphate and 6 g/l of calcium carbonate.
      <br/>
      The pH is adjusted to 6 with hydrochloric acid before addition of the calcium carbonate.
      <br/>
      The Erlenmeyers are stirred for 24 h, 27 h or 30 h. 10 g of must are then weighed into a smooth Erlenmeyer, to which amount 20 ml of mobile phase composed of 62.5% of acetonitrile and 37.5% of a 0.1 M solution of concentrated K2HPO4 are added.
      <br/>
      After stirring on a stirrer (325 rpm) for 20 minutes at room temperature, the mixture is filtered through filter paper and the pristinamycin contained in the filtrate is assayed by LC.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, 2.4 ml of the filtrate are dissolved in a diluent composed of acetonitrile and water in a 30:70 ratio.
      <br/>
      This solution is injected onto an SFCC column (length: 25 cm; diameter: 1/4 inch; stationary phase: Nucleosil C8 5 microns).
      <br/>
      The mobile phase is composed of 630 ml of 0.1 M KH2PO4 (adjusted to pH 3 with H3PO4) and 370 ml of acetonitrile, and elution is performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/minute.
      <br/>
      The streptogramins are detected by measuring absorption at 206 nm with an LDC Spectromonitor III detector.

      <br/>
      This suspension is then distributed in 4 100-ml Erlenmeyers in the proportion of 10 ml per Erlenmeyer, equivalent to approximately 6 * 108 spores/Erlenmeyer. 0.4 ml of EMS is then added into each Erlenmeyer (final concentration 4%), and the suspensions are stirred at 280 rpm and at 30 (degree)  C. for variable times (see table).
      <br/>
      The suspensions are then transferred to large 250-ml pots, and 90 ml of 0.16 M Na2S3O3.5H2O solution are added.

      A 0.5 ml sample is removed from each pot and plated out on a dish containing HT medium to determine the degree of survival by counting relative to the control (see table).

      Bacteriol. 126 (1976) 13).
      <br/>
      After phenotypic expression overnight at 30 (degree)  C. with stirring (280 rpm), the cells are plated out on a dish containing HT medium to determine the degree of auxotrophy and the morphological heterogeneity of the colonies.
      <br/>
      To measure the degree of auxotrophy, the colonies are subcultured on minimum medium and the % of colonies incapable of growth is determined.
