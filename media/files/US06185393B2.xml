    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a developing apparatus, a magnetic seal mounting method and a process cartridge.</p>
    <p num="2">
      The process cartridge contains integrally electrophotographic photosensitive member and charging means, developing means or cleaning means, and is detachably mountable relative to a main assembly of the image forming apparatus.
      <br/>
      It may integrally contain the electrophotographic photosensitive member and at least one of the charging means, the developing means and the cleaning means.
      <br/>
      As another example, it may contain the electrophotographic photosensitive member and at least the developing means.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In an electrophotographic image forming apparatus using an electrophotographic image forming process, the process cartridge is used, which contains the electrophotographic photosensitive member and process means actable on said electrophotographic photosensitive member, and which is detachably mountable as a unit to a main assembly of the image forming apparatus (process cartridge type).
      <br/>
      With this process cartridge type, the maintenance of the apparatus can be carried out in effect by the user without depending on a serviceman.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the process cartridge type is now widely used in electrophotographic image forming apparatuses.
    </p>
    <p num="4">The process cartridge is provided with a seal for preventing the developer from leaking out.</p>

    </p>
    <p num="15">Electrophotographic Image Forming Apparatus A and Process Cartridge B</p>
    <p num="16">
      First, referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a laser beam printer A as an electrophotographic image forming apparatus which embodies the present invention will be described.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 is a cross-section of a process cartridge which also embodies the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Referring to FIG. 1, the laser beam printer A is an apparatus which forms an image on a recording medium (for example, recording sheet, OHP sheet, and fabric) through an electrophotographic image forming process.
      <br/>
      It forms a toner image on an electrophotographic photosensitive drum (hereinafter, photosensitive drum) in the form of a drum.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the photosensitive drum is charged with the use of a charging means, and a laser beam modulated with the image data of a target image is projected from an optical means onto the charged peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum, forming thereon a latent image in accordance with the image data.
      <br/>
      This latent image is developed into a toner image by a developing means.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, a recording medium 2 placed in a sheet feeding cassette 3a is reversed and conveyed by a pickup roller 3b, conveyer roller pairs 3c and 3d, and register roller pair 3e, in synchronism with the toner formation.
      <br/>
      Then, voltage is applied to an image transferring roller 4 as a means for transferring the toner image formed on the photosensitive drum 7 of the process cartridge B, whereby the toner image is transferred onto the recording medium 2.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the recording medium 2, onto which the toner image has been transferred, is conveyed to a fixing means 5 by guiding conveyer 3f.
      <br/>
      The fixing means 5 has a driving roller 5c, and a fixing roller 5b containing a heater 5a, and applies heat and pressure to the recording medium 2 as the recording medium 2 is passed through the fixing means 5, so that the image having been transferred onto the recording medium 2 is fixed to the recording medium 2.
      <br/>
      Then, the recording medium 2 is conveyed farther, and is discharged into a delivery tray 6 through a reversing path 3j, by discharging roller pairs 3g, 3h and 3i.
      <br/>
      The delivery tray 6 is located at the top of the main assembly 14 of the image forming apparatus A. It should be noted here that a pivotable flapper 3k may be operated in coordination with a discharge roller pair 3m to discharge the recording medium 2 without passing it through the reversing path 3j.
      <br/>
      The pickup roller 3b, conveyer roller pairs 3c and 3d, register roller pair 3e, guiding conveyer 3f, discharge roller pairs 3g, 3h and 3i, and discharge roller pair 3m constitute a conveying means 3.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIGS. 3-8, in the process cartridge B, on the other hand, the photosensitive drum 7 with a photosensitive layer 7e (FIG. 11) is rotated to uniformly charge its surface by applying voltage to the charging roller 8 as a photosensitive drum charging means.
      <br/>
      Then, a laser beam modulated with the image data is projected onto the photosensitive drum 7 from the optical system 1 through an exposure opening 1e, forming a latent image on the photosensitive drum 7.
      <br/>
      The thus formed latent image is developed with the use of toner and the developing means 9.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the charging roller 8 is disposed in contact with the photosensitive drum 7 to charge the photosensitive drum 7.
      <br/>
      It is rotated by the rotation of the photosensitive drum 7.
      <br/>
      The developing means 9 provides the peripheral surface area (area to be developed) of the photosensitive drum 7 with toner so that the latent image formed on the photosensitive drum 7 is developed.
      <br/>
      The optical system 1 comprises a laser diode 1a, a polygon mirror 1b, a lens 1c, and a deflective mirror 1d.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the developing means 9, the toner contained in a toner container 11A is delivered to a developing roller 9c by the rotation of a toner feeding member 9b.
      <br/>
      The developing roller 9c contains a stationary magnet.
      <br/>
      It is also rotated so that a layer of toner with triboelectric charge is formed on the peripheral surface of the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      The image developing area of the photosensitive drum 7 is provided with the toner from this toner layer, the toner is transferred onto the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 7 in a manner to reflect the latent image, visualizing the latent image as a toner image.
      <br/>
      The developing blade 9d is a blade which regulates the amount of the toner adhered to the peripheral surface of the developing roller 9c and also triboelectrically charges the toner.
      <br/>
      Adjacent to the developing roller 9c, a toner stirring member 9e is rotatively disposed to circulatively stir the toner within the image developing chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      After the toner image formed on the photosensitive drum 7 is transferred onto the recording medium 2 by applying voltage with polarity opposite to that of the toner image to the image transferring roller 4, the residual toner on the photosensitive drum 7 is removed by the cleaning means 10.
      <br/>
      The cleaning means 10 comprises an elastic cleaning blade 10a disposed in contact with the photosensitive drum 7, and the toner remaining on the photosensitive drum 7 is scraped off by the elastic cleaning blade 10a, being collected into a waste toner collector 10b.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The process cartridge B is formed in the following manner.
      <br/>
      First, a toner chamber frame 11 which comprises a toner container (toner storing portion) 11A for storing toner is joined with an image developing chamber frame 12 which houses the image developing means 9 such as an image developing roller 9c, and then, a cleaning chamber frame 13, in which the photosensitive drum 7, the cleaning means 10 such as the cleaning blade 10a, and the charging roller 8 are mounted, is joined with the preceding two frames 11 and 12 to complete the process cartridge B. The thus formed process cartridge B is removably installable into the main assembly 14 of the image forming apparatus A.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The process cartridge B is provided with an exposure opening is through which a light beam modulated with image data is projected onto the photosensitive drum 7, and a transfer opening 13n through which the photosensitive drum 7 opposes the recording medium 2.
      <br/>
      The exposure opening 1e is a part of the cleaning chamber frame 11, and the transfer opening 13n is located between the image developing chamber frame 12 and the cleaning chamber frame 13.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Next, the structure of the housing of the process cartridge B in this embodiment will be described.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The process cartridge in this embodiment is formed in the following manner.
      <br/>
      First the toner chamber frame 11 and the image developing chamber frame 12 are joined, and then, the cleaning chamber frame 13 is rotatively joined with the preceding two frames 11 and 12 to complete the housing.
      <br/>
      In this housing, the aforementioned photosensitive drum 7, charging roller 8, developing means 9, cleaning means 10, and the like, are mounted to complete the process cartridge B. The thus formed process cartridge B is removably installable into the cartridge accommodating means provided in the main assembly 14 of an image forming apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Housing Structure of Process Cartridge B</p>
    <p num="26">
      As described above, the housing of the process cartridge B in this embodiment is formed by joining the toner chamber frame 11, the image developing chamber frame 12, and the cleaning chamber frame 13.
      <br/>
      Next, the structure of the thus formed housing will be described.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Referring to FIGS. 3 and 20, in the toner chamber frame 11, the toner feeding member 9b is rotatively mounted.
      <br/>
      In the image developing chamber frame 12, the image developing roller 9c and the developing blade 9d are mounted, and adjacent to the developing roller 9c, the stirring member 9c is rotatively mounted to circulatively stir the toner within the image developing chamber.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 3 and 19, in the image developing chamber frame 12, a rod antenna 9h is mounted, extending in the lengthwise direction of the developing roller 9c substantially in parallel to the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      The toner chamber frame 11 and the development chamber frame 12, which are equipped in the above-described manner, are welded together (in this embodiment, by ultrasonic wave) to form a second frame which constitutes an image developing unit D (FIG. 13).
    </p>
    <p num="28">The image developing unit of the process cartridge B is provided with a drum shutter assembly 18, which covers the photosensitive drum 7 to prevent it from being exposed to light for an extend period of time or from coming in contact with foreign objects when or after the process cartridge B is removed from the main assembly 14 of an image forming apparatus.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Referring to FIG. 6, the drum shutter assembly 18 has a shutter cover 18a which covers or exposes the transfer opening 13n illustrated in FIG. 3, and linking members 18b and 18c which support the shutter cover 18.
      <br/>
      On the upstream side relative to the direction in which the recording medium 2 is conveyed, one end of the right-hand side linking member 18c is fitted in a hole 40g of a developing means gear holder 40 as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, and one end of the left-hand side linking member 18c is fitted in a boss 11h of the bottom portion 11b of the toner chamber frame 11.
      <br/>
      The other ends of the left- and right-hand linking members 18c are attached to the corresponding lengthwise ends of the shutter cover 18a, on the upstream side relative to the recording medium conveying direction.
      <br/>
      The linking member 18c is made of metallic rod.
      <br/>
      Actually, the left- and right-hand linking members 18c are connected through the shutter cover 18a; in other words, the left- and right-hand linking members 18c are the left- and right-hand ends of a single piece linking member 18c.
      <br/>
      The linking member 18b is provided only on one lengthwise end of the shutter cover 18a.
      <br/>
      One end of the linking member 18b is attached to the shutter cover 18a, on the downstream side, relative to the recording medium conveying direction, of the position at which the linking member 18c is attached to the shutter cover 18a, and the other end of the linking member 18b is fitted around a dowel 12d of the image development chamber frame 12.
      <br/>
      The linking member 18b is formed of synthetic resin.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The linking members 18b and 18c, which are different in length, form a four piece linkage structure in conjunction with the shutter cover 18a and the toner chamber frame 11.
      <br/>
      As the process cartridge B is inserted into an image forming apparatus, the portion 18c1 of the linking member 18c, which projects away from the process cartridge B, comes in contact with the stationary contact member (unillustrated) provided on the lateral wall of the cartridge accommodating space S of the main assembly 14 of the image forming apparatus, and activates the drum shutter assembly 18 to open the shutter cover 18a.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The drum shutter assembly 18 constituted of the shutter cover 18a and the linking members 18b and 18c is loaded with the pressure from an unillustrated torsional coil spring fitted around a dowel 12d.
      <br/>
      One end of the spring is anchored to the linking member 18b, and the other end is anchored to the image developing chamber frame 12, so that the pressure is generated in the direction to cause the shutter cover 18a to cover the transfer opening 13n.
    </p>
    <p num="32">Referring again to FIGS. 3 and 12, the cleaning means frame 13 is fitted with the photosensitive drum 7, the charging roller 8, and the various components of the cleaning means 10, to form a first frame as a cleaning unit C (FIG. 12).</p>
    <p num="33">
      Then, the aforementioned image developing unit D and cleaning unit C are joined with the use of a joining member 22, in a mutually pivotable manner, to complete the process cartridge B. More specifically, referring to FIG. 13, both lengthwise (axial direction of the developing roller 9c) ends of the image developing chamber frame 12 are provided with an arm portion 19, which is provided with a round hole 20 which is in parallel to the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a recessed portion 21 for accommodating the arm portion 19 is provided at each lengthwise end of the cleaning chamber frame (FIG. 12).
      <br/>
      The arm portion 19 is inserted in this recessed portion 21, and the joining member 22 is pressed into the mounting hole 13e of the cleaning chamber frame 13, put through the hole 20 of the end portion of the arm portion 19, and pressed, farther, into the hole 13e of an partitioning wall 13t, so that the image developing unit D and the cleaning unit C are joined to be pivotable relative to each other about the joining member 22.
      <br/>
      In joining the image developing unit D and the cleaning unit C, a compression type coil spring 22a is placed between the two units, with one end of the coil spring being fitted around an unillustrated dowel erected from the base portion of the arm portion 19, and the other end being pressed against the top wall of the recessed portion 21 of the cleaning chamber frame 13.
      <br/>
      As a result, the image developing chamber frame 12 is pressed downward to reliably keep the developing roller 9c pressed downward toward the photosensitive drum 7.
      <br/>
      More specifically, referring to FIG. 13, a roller 9i having a diameter larger than that of the developing roller 9c is attached to each lengthwise end of the developing roller 9c, and this roller 9i is pressed on the photosensitive drum 7 to maintain a predetermined gap (approximately 300  MU m) between the photosensitive drum 7 and the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      The top surface of the recessed portion 21 of the cleaning chamber frame 13 is slanted so that the compression type coil spring 22a is gradually compressed when the image developing unit D and the cleaning unit C are united.
      <br/>
      That is, the image developing unit D and the cleaning unit C are pivotable toward each other about the joining member 22, wherein the positional relationship (gap) between the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 7 and the peripheral surface of the developing roller 9c is precisely maintained by the elastic force of the compression type coil spring 22a.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Since the compression type coil spring 22a is attached to the base portion of the arm portion 19 of the image developing chamber frame 12, the elastic force of the compression type coil spring 22a affects nowhere but the base portion of the arm portion 19.
      <br/>
      In a case in which the image developing chamber frame 12 is provided with a dedicated spring mount for the compression type coil spring 22a, the adjacencies of the spring seat must be reinforced to precisely maintain the predetermined gap between the photosensitive drum 7 and the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      However, with the placement of the compression type coil spring 22a in the above described manner, it is unnecessary to reinforce the adjacencies of the spring seat, that is, the adjacencies of the base portion of the arm portion 19 in the case of this embodiment, because the base portion of the arm portion 19 is inherently greater in strength and rigidity.

    <p num="35">The above described structure which holds together the cleaning chamber frame 13 and the image developing chamber frame 12 will be described later in more detail.</p>
    <p num="36">Structure of Process Cartridge B Guiding Means</p>
    <p num="37">
      Next, the means for guiding the process cartridge B when the process cartridge B is installed into, or removed from, the main assembly 14 of an image forming apparatus.
      <br/>
      This guiding means is illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 10. FIG. 9 is a perspective view of the left-hand side of the guiding means, as seen (in the direction of an arrow mark X) from the side from which the process cartridge B is installed into the main assembly 14 of the image forming apparatus A (as seen from the side of the image developing unit D side).
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 is a perspective view of the right-hand side of the same, as seen from the same side.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Referring to FIGS. 4, 5, 6 and 7, each lengthwise end of the cleaning frame portion 13 is provided with means which serves as a guide when the process cartridge B is installed into, or removed from, the apparatus main assembly 14.
      <br/>
      This guiding means is constituted of a cylindrical guides 13aR and 13aL as a cartridge positioning guiding member, and rotation controlling guides 13bR and 13bL as means for controlling the attitude of the process cartridge B when the process cartridge B is installed or removed.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      As illustrated in FIG. 5, the cylindrical guide 13aR is a hollow cylindrical member.
      <br/>
      The rotation controlling guides 13bR is integrally formed together with the cylindrical guide 13aR, and radially protrudes from the peripheral surface of the cylindrical guide 13aR.
      <br/>
      The cylindrical guide 13aR is provided with a mounting flange 13aR1 which is also integral with the cylindrical guide 13aR.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cylindrical guide 13aR, the rotation controlling guide 13bR, and the mounting flange 13aR1 constitute the right-hand side guiding member 13R, which is fixed to the cleaning chamber frame 13 with small screws put through the screw holes of the mounting flange 13aRa.
      <br/>
      With the right-hand side guiding member 13R being fixed to the cleaning chamber frame 13, the rotation controlling guide 13bR extends over the lateral wall of the developing means gear holder 40 fixed to the image developing chamber frame 12.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Referring to FIG. 11, a drum shaft member is constituted of a drum shaft portion 7a inclusive of a larger diameter portion 7a2, a disk-shaped flange portion 29 and a cylindrical guide portion 13aL.
      <br/>
      The larger diameter portion 7a2 is fitted in the hole 13k1 of the cleaning frame portion 13.
      <br/>
      The flange portion 29 is engaged with a positioning pin 13c projecting from the side wall of the lengthwise end wall of the cleaning frame portion 13, being prevented from rotating, and is fixed to the cleaning frame portion 13 with the use of small screws 13d.
      <br/>
      The cylindrical guide 13aL projects outward (toward front, that is, the direction perpendicular to the page of FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      The aforementioned stationary drum shaft 7a which rotatively supports a spur gear 7n fitted around the photosensitive drum 7 projects inwardly from the flange 29 (FIG. 11).
      <br/>
      The cylindrical guide 13aL and the drum shaft 7a are coaxial.
      <br/>
      The flange 29, the cylindrical guide 13aL, and the drum shaft 7a, are integrally formed of metallic material such as steel.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Referring to FIG. 6, there is a rotation controlling guide 13bL slightly away from the cylindrical guide 13aL.
      <br/>
      It is long and narrow, extending substantially in the radial direction of the cylindrical guide 13aL and also projecting outward from the cleaning chamber frame 13.
      <br/>
      It is integrally formed with the cleaning chamber frame 13.
      <br/>
      In order to accommodate this rotation controlling guide 13bL, the flange 29 is provided with a cutaway portion.
      <br/>
      The distance the rotation controlling guide 13bL projects outward is such that its end surface is substantially even with the end surface of the cylindrical guide 13aL.
      <br/>
      The rotation controlling guide 13bL extends over the side wall of the developing roller bearing box 9v fixed to the image developing chamber frame 12.
      <br/>
      As is evident from the above description, the left-hand side guiding member 13L is constituted of separate two pieces: the metallic cylindrical guide 13aL and the rotation controlling guide 13bL of synthetic resin.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Next, a regulatory contact portion 13j, which is a part of the top surface of the cleaning chamber frame 13, will be described.
      <br/>
      In the following description of the regulatory contact portion 13j, "top surface" means the surface which faces upward when the process cartridge B is in the main assembly 14 of an image forming apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Referring to FIGS. 4-7, two portions 13j of the top surface 13i of the cleaning unit C, which are the portions right next to the right and left front corners 13p and 13q, relative to the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the process cartridge B is inserted, constitute the regulatory contact portions 13j, which regulate the position and attitude of the process cartridge B when the cartridge B is installed into the main assembly 14.
      <br/>
      In other words, when the process cartridge B is installed into the main assembly 14, the regulatory contact portion 13j comes in contact with the fixed contact member 25 provided in the main assembly 14 of an image forming apparatus (FIGS. 9, 10 and 30), and regulates the rotation of the process cartridge B about the cylindrical guide 13aR and 13aL.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Next, the guiding means on the main assembly side 14 will be described.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 1, as the lid 35 of the main assembly 14 of an image forming apparatus is pivotally opened about a supporting point 35a in the counterclockwise direction, the top portion of the main assembly 14 is exposed, and the process cartridge accommodating portion appears as illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 10. The left and right internal walls of the image forming apparatus main assembly 14, relative to the direction in which the process cartridge B is inserted, are provided with guide members 16L (FIG. 9) and 16R (FIG. 10), respectively, which extend diagonally downward from the side opposite to the supporting point 35a.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      As shown in the drawings, the guide members 16L and 16R comprise guide portions 16a and 16c, and positioning grooves 16b and 16d connected to the guide portions 16a and 16c, respectively.
      <br/>
      The guide portions 16a and 16c extend diagonally downward, as seen from the direction indicated by an arrow mark X, that is, the direction in which the process cartridge B is inserted.
      <br/>
      The positioning grooves 16b and 16d have a semicircular cross-section which perfectly matches the cross-section of the cylindrical guides 13aL or 13aR of the process cartridge B. After the process cartridge B is completely installed in the apparatus main assembly 14, the centers of semicircular cross-sections of the positioning groove 16b and 16d coincide with the axial lines of the cylindrical guides 13aL and 13aR, respectively, of the process cartridge B, and hence, with the axial line of the photosensitive drum 7.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The width of the guide portions 16a and 16c as seen from the direction in which the process cartridge B is installed or removed is wide enough to allow the cylindrical guides 13aL and 13aR to ride on them with a reasonable amount of play.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the rotation controlling guide 13bL and 13bR which are narrower than the diameter of the cylindrical guide 13aL and 13aR naturally fit more loosely in the guide portions 16a and 16c than the cylindrical guides 13aL and 13aR, respectively, yet their rotation is controlled by the guide portions 16a and 16c.
      <br/>
      In other words, when the process cartridge B is installed, the angle of the process cartridge B is kept within a predetermined range.
      <br/>
      After the process cartridge B is installed in the image forming apparatus main assembly 14, the cylindrical guides 13aL and 13aR of the process cartridge B are in engagement with the positioning grooves 16b and 16d of the guiding members 13L and 13R, and the left and right regulatory contact portions 13j located at the front portion, relative to the cartridge inserting direction, of the cleaning chamber frame 13 of the process cartridge B, are in contact with the fixed positioning members 25, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="47">The weight distribution of the process cartridge B is such that when the line which coincides with the axial lines of the cylindrical guide 13aL and 13aR is level, the image developing unit D side of the process cartridge B generates larger moment about this line than the cleaning unit C side.</p>
    <p num="48">
      The process cartridge B is installed into the image forming apparatus main assembly 14 in the following manner.
      <br/>
      First, the cylindrical guide 13aL and 13aR of the process cartridge B are inserted into the guide portion 16a and 16c, respectively, of the cartridge accommodating portion in the image forming apparatus main assembly 14 by grasping the recessed portion 17 and ribbed portion 11c of the process cartridge B with one hand, and the rotation controlling guide 13bL and 13bR are also inserted into the guide portions 16a and 16c, tilting downward the front portion, relative to the inserting direction, of the process cartridge B. Then, the process cartridge B is inserted farther with the cylindrical guides 13aL and 13aR and the rotation controlling guides 13bL and 13bR of the process cartridge B following the guide portions 16a and 16c, respectively, until the cylindrical guides 13aL and 13aR reach the positioning grooves 16b and 16d of the image forming apparatus main assembly 14.
      <br/>
      Then, the cylindrical guides 13aL and 13aR become seated in the positioning grooves 16b and 16d, respectively, due to the weight of the process cartridge B itself; the cylindrical guides 13aL and 13aR of the process cartridge B are accurately positioned relative to the positioning grooves 16b and 16d.
      <br/>
      In this condition, the line which coincides with the axial lines of the cylindrical guides 13aL and 13aR also coincides with the axial line of the photosensitive drum 7, and therefore, the photosensitive drum 7 is reasonably accurately positioned relative to the image forming apparatus main assembly 14.
      <br/>
      It should be noted here that the final positioning of the photosensitive drum 7 relative to the image forming apparatus main assembly 14 occurs at the same time as the coupling between the two is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Also in this condition, there is a slight gap between the stationary positioning member 25 of the image forming apparatus main assembly 14 and the regulatory contact portion 13j of the process cartridge B. At this point of time, the process cartridge B is released from the hand.
      <br/>
      Then, the process cartridge B rotates about the cylindrical guides 13aL and 13aR in the direction to lower the image developing unit D side and raise the cleaning unit C side until the regulatory contact portions 13j of the process cartridge B come in contact with the corresponding stationary positioning members 25.
      <br/>
      As a result, the process cartridge B is accurately positioned relative to the image forming apparatus main assembly 14.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the lid 35 is closed by rotating it clockwise about the supporting point 35a.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In order to remove the process cartridge B from the apparatus main assembly 14, the above described steps are carried out in reverse.
      <br/>
      More specifically, first, the lid 35 of the apparatus main assembly 14 is opened, and the process cartridge B is pulled upward by grasping the aforementioned top and bottom ribbed portions 11c, that is, the handhold portions, of the process cartridge by hand.
      <br/>
      Then, the cylindrical guides 13aL and 13aR of the process cartridge B rotate in the positioning grooves 16b and 16d of the apparatus main assembly 14.
      <br/>
      As a result, the regulatory contact portions 13j of the process cartridge B separate from the corresponding stationary positioning member 25.
      <br/>
      Next, the process cartridge B is pulled more.
      <br/>
      Then, the cylindrical guides 13aL and 13aR come out of the positioning grooves 16b and 16d, and move into the guide portions 16a and 16c of the guiding member 16L and 16R, respectively, fixed to the apparatus main assembly 14.
      <br/>
      In this condition, the process cartridge B is pulled more.
      <br/>
      Then, the cylindrical guides 13aL and 13aR and the rotation controlling guides 13bL and 13bR of the process cartridge B slide diagonally upward through the guide portions 16a and 16c of the apparatus main assembly 14, with the angle of the process cartridge B being controlled so that the process cartridge B can be completely moved out of the apparatus main assembly 14 without making contact with the portions other than the guide portions 16a and 16c.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Referring to FIG. 12, the spur gear 7n is fitted around one of the lengthwise ends of the photosensitive drum 7, which is the end opposite to where the helical drum gear 7b is fitted.
      <br/>
      As the process cartridge B is inserted into the apparatus main assembly 14, the spur gear 7n meshes with a gear (unillustrated) coaxial with the image transferring roller 4 located in the apparatus main assembly, and transmits from the process cartridge B to the transferring roller 4 the driving force which rotates the transferring roller 4.

    <p num="52">Toner Chamber Frame</p>
    <p num="53">
      Referring to FIGS. 3, 5, 7, 16, 20 and 21, the toner chamber frame will be described in detail.
      <br/>
      FIG. 20 is a perspective view of the toner chamber frame as seen before a toner seal is welded on, and FIG. 21 is a perspective view of the toner chamber frame after toner is fitted in.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Referring to FIG. 3, the toner chamber frame 11 is constituted of two portions: the top and bottom portions 11a and 11b.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 1, the top portion 11a bulges upward, occupying the space on the left-hand side of the optical system 1 in the image forming apparatus main assembly 14, so that the toner capacity of the process cartridge B can be increased without increasing the size of the image forming apparatus A. Referring to FIGS. 3, 4 and 7, the top portion 11a of the toner chamber frame 11 has a recessed portion 17, which is located at the lengthwise center portion of the top portion 11a, and serves as a handhold.
      <br/>
      An operator of the image forming apparatus can handle the process cartridge B by grasping it by the recessed portion 17 of the top portion 11a and the downward facing side of the bottom portion 11b.
      <br/>
      The ribs 11c extending on the downward facing surface of the bottom portion 11b in the lengthwise direction of the bottom portion 11b serve to prevent the process cartridge B from slipping out of the operator's hand.
      <br/>
      Referring again to FIG. 3, the flange 11a1 of the top portion 11a is aligned with the raised-edge flange 11b 1 of the bottom portion 11b, the flange 11a1 being fitted within the raised edge of the flange 11b1 of the bottom portion 11b1, so that the walls of the top and bottom portions of the toner chamber frame 11 perfectly meet at the welding surface U, and then, the top and bottom portions 11a and 11b of the toner chamber frame 11 are welded together by melting the welding ribs with the application of ultrasonic waves.
      <br/>
      The method for uniting the top and bottom portions 11a and 11b of the toner chamber frame 11 does not need to be limited to ultrasonic welding.
      <br/>
      They may be welded by heat or forced vibration, or may be glued together.
      <br/>
      Further, the bottom portion 11b of the toner chamber frame 11 is provided with a stepped portion 11m, in addition to the flange 11b1 which keeps the top and bottom portions 11a and 11b aligned when they are welded together by ultrasonic welding.
      <br/>
      The stepped portion 11m is located above an opening 11i and is substantially in the same plane as the flange 11b1.
      <br/>
      The structures of stepped portion 11m and its adjacencies will be described later.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Before the top and bottom portions 11a and 11b of the toner chamber frame 11 are united, a toner feeding member 9b is assembled into the bottom portion 11, and a coupling member 11e is attached to the end of the toner feeding member 9b through the hole 11e1 of the side wall of the toner chamber frame 11 as shown in FIG. 16. The hole 11e1 is located one of the lengthwise ends of the bottom portion 11b, and the side plate which has the hole 11e1 is also provided with a toner filling opening 11d substantially shaped like a right triangle.
      <br/>
      The triangular rim of the toner filling opening 11d is constituted of a first edge which is one of two edges that are substantially perpendicular to each other, and extends along the joint between the top and bottom portion 11a and 11b of the toner chamber frame 11, a second edge which vertically extends in the direction substantially perpendicular to the first edge, and a third edge, that is, a diagonal edge, which extends along the slanted edge of the bottom portion 11b.
      <br/>
      In other words, the toner filling opening 11d is rendered as large as possible, while being located next to the hole 11e1.
      <br/>
      Next, referring to FIG. 20, the toner chamber frame 11 is provided with an opening 11i through which toner is fed from the toner chamber frame 11 into the image developing chamber frame 12, and a seal (which will be described later) is welded to seal this opening 11i.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, toner is filled into the toner chamber frame 11 through the toner filling opening 11d, and then, the toner filling opening 11d is sealed with a toner sealing cap 11f to finish a toner unit J. The toner sealing cap 11f is formed of polyethylene, polypropylene, or the like, and is pressed into, or glued to, the toner filling opening 11d of the toner chamber frame 11 so that it does not come off.
      <br/>
      Next, the toner unit J is welded to the image developing chamber frame 12, which will be described later, by ultrasonic welding, to form the image developing unit D. The means for uniting the toner unit J and the image developing unit D is not limited to ultrasonic welding; it may be gluing or snap-fitting which utilizes the elasticity of the materials of the two units.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Referring to FIG. 3, the slanted surface K of the bottom portion 11b of the toner chamber frame 11 is given an angle of  THETA  so that the toner in the top portion of the toner chamber frame 11 naturally slides down as the toner at the bottom is consumed.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it is desirable that the angle  THETA  formed between the slanted surface K of the process cartridge B in the apparatus main assembly 14 and the horizontal line Z is approximately 65 deg. when the apparatus main assembly 14 is horizontally placed.
      <br/>
      The bottom portion 11b is given an outwardly bulging portion 11g so that it does not interfere with the rotation of the toner feeding member 9b.
      <br/>
      The diameter of the sweeping range of the toner feeding member 9b is approximately 37 mm.
      <br/>
      The height of the bulging portion 11g has only to be approximately 0-10 mm from the imaginary extension of the slanted surface K. This is due to the following reason; if the bottom surface of the bulging portion 11g is above the imaginary extension of the slanted surface K, the toner which, otherwise, naturally slides down from the top portion of the slanted surface K and is fed into the image developing chamber frame 12, partially fails to be fed into the image developing chamber frame 12, collecting in the area where the slanted surface K and the outwardly bulging portion 11g meet.
      <br/>
      Contrarily, in the case of the toner chamber frame 11 in this embodiment, the toner is reliably fed into the image developing chamber frame 12 from the toner chamber frame 11.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The toner feeding member 9b is formed of a steel rod having a diameter of approximately 2 mm, and is in the form of a crank shaft.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 20 which illustrates one end of the toner feeding member 9b, one 9b1 of the journals of the toner feeding member 9b is fitted in a hole 11r which is located in the toner chamber frame 11, adjacent to the opening 11i of the toner chamber frame 11.
      <br/>
      The other of the journals is fixed to the coupling member 11e (where the journal is fixed to the coupling member 11e is not visible in FIG. 20).
    </p>
    <p num="58">As described above, providing the bottom wall of the toner chamber frame section 11 with the outwardly bulging portion 11g as the sweeping space for the toner feeding member 9b makes it possible to provide the process cartridge B with stable toner feeding performance without cost increase.</p>
    <p num="59">
      Referring to FIGS. 3, 20 and 22, the opening 11i through which toner is fed from the toner chamber frame section 11 into the development chamber frame section is located at the joint between the toner chamber frame section 11 and the development chamber frame section 12.
      <br/>
      The opening 11i is surrounded by an recessed surface 11k which in turn is surrounded by the top and bottom portions 11j and 11j1 of the flange of the toner chamber frame 11.
      <br/>
      The lengthwise outer (top) edge of the top portion 11j and the lengthwise outer (bottom) edge of the bottom portion 11j1 are provided with grooves 11n, respectively, which are parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      The top portion 11j of the flange above the recessed surface 11k is in the form of a gate, and the surface of the bottom portion 11j1 of the flange is perpendicular to the surface of the recessed surface 11k.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 22, the plane of the bottom surface 11n2 of the groove 11n is on the outward side (toward the image developing chamber frame 12) of the surface of the recessed surface 11k.
      <br/>
      However, the flange of the toner chamber frame 11 may be structured like the flange illustrated in FIG. 39 in which the top and bottom portion 11j of the flanges are in the same plane and surround the opening 11i like the top and bottom pieces of a picture frame.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Referring to FIG. 19, an alphanumeric reference 12u designates one of the flat surfaces of the image developing chamber frame 12, which faces the toner chamber frame 11.
      <br/>
      The flange 12e which is parallel to the flat surface 12u and surrounds all four edges of this flat surface 12u like a picture frame is provided at a level slightly recessed from the flat surface 12u.
      <br/>
      The lengthwise edges of the flange 12e are provided with a tongue 12v which fit into the groove 11n of the toner chamber frame 11.
      <br/>
      The top surface of the tongue 12v is provided with an angular ridge 12v1 (FIG. 22) for ultrasonic welding.
      <br/>
      After the various components are assembled into the toner chamber frame 11 and image developing chamber frame 12, the tongue of the image developing chamber frame 12 is fitted into the groove 11n of the toner chamber frame 11, and the two frames 11 and 12 are welded together along the tongue 12v and groove 11n (detail will be given later).
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Referring to FIG. 21, a cover film 51, which can be easily torn in the lengthwise direction of the process cartridge B, is pasted to the recessed surface 11k to seal the opening 11i of the toner chamber frame 11; it is pasted to the toner chamber frame 11, on the recessed surface 11k, alongside the four edges of the opening 11i.
      <br/>
      In order to unseal the opening 11i by tearing the cover film 51, the process cartridge B is provided with a tear tape 52, which is welded to the cover film 51.
      <br/>
      The cover tape 52 is doubled back from the lengthwise end 52b of the opening 11i, is put through between an elastic sealing member 54 such as a piece of felt (FIG. 19) and the opposing surface of the toner chamber frame 11, at the end opposite to the end 52b, and is slightly extended from the process cartridge B. The end portion 52a of the slightly sticking out tear tape 52 is adhered to a pull-tab lit which is to be grasped with hand (FIGS. 6, 20 and 21).
      <br/>
      The pull-tab lit is integrally formed with the toner chamber frame 11, wherein the joint portion between the pull-tab lit and the toner chamber frame 11 is substantially thin so that the pull-tab lit can be easily torn away from the toner chamber frame 11.
      <br/>
      The surface of the sealing member 54, except for the peripheral areas, is covered with a synthetic resin film tape 55 having a small friction coefficient.
      <br/>
      The tape 55 is pasted to the sealing member 54.
      <br/>
      Further, the flat surface 12e located at the other of the lengthwise end portions of the toner chamber frame 11, that is, the end portion opposite to the position where the elastic sealing member 54 is located, is covered with the elastic sealing member 56, which is pasted to the flat surface 12e (FIG. 19).
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The elastic sealing members 54 and 56 are pasted on the flange 12e, at the corresponding lengthwise ends, across the entire width of the flange 12e.
      <br/>
      As the toner chamber frame 11 and the image developing chamber frame 12 are joined, the elastic sealing members 54 and 56 exactly cover the corresponding lengthwise end portions of the flange 11j surrounding the recessed surface 11k, across the entire width the flange 11j, overlapping with the tongue 12v.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      Further, in order to precisely position the toner chamber frame 11 and the image developing chamber frame 12 relative to each other when they are joined, the flange 11j of the toner chamber frame 11 is provided with a round hole 11r and a square hole 11q which engage with the cylindrical dowel 12w1 and square dowel 12w2, respectively, of the image developing chamber frame 12.
      <br/>
      The round hole 11r tightly fits with the dowel 12w1, whereas the square hole 11q loosely fits with the dowel 12w2 in terms of the lengthwise direction while tightly fitting therewith in terms of the lengthwise direction.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The toner chamber frame 11 and the image developing chamber frame 12 are independently assembled as a compound component prior to a process in which they are united.
      <br/>
      Then, they are united in the following manner.
      <br/>
      First, the cylindrical positioning dowel 12w1 and square positioning dowel 12w2 of the image developing chamber frame 12 are fitted into the positioning round hole 11r and positioning square hole 11q of the toner chamber frame 11, and the tongue 12v of the image developing chamber frame 12 is placed in the groove 11n of the toner chamber frame 11.
      <br/>
      Then, the toner chamber frame 11 and the image developing chamber frame 12 are pressed toward each other.
      <br/>
      As a result, the sealing members 54 and 56 come in contact with, being thereby compressed by, the corresponding lengthwise end portions of the flange 11j, and at the same time, a rib-like projections 12z, which are located, as a spacer, at each lengthwise end of the flat surface 12u of the image developing chamber frame 12, are positioned close to the flange 11j of the toner chamber frame 11.
      <br/>
      The rib-like projection 12z is integrally formed with the image developing chamber frame 12, and is located at both sides, relative to the lengthwise direction, of the tear tape 52, so that the tear tape can be passed between the opposing projections 12z.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      With the toner chamber frame 11 and the image developing chamber frame 12 being pressed toward each other as described above, ultrasonic vibration is applied between the tongue-like portion 12v and the groove 11n.
      <br/>
      As a result, the angular ridge 12v1 is melted by frictional heat and fuses with the bottom of the groove 11n.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the rim portion 11n1 of the groove 11n of the toner chamber frame 11 and the rib-like projection 12z of the image developing chamber frame 12 remain airtightly in contact with each other, leaving a space between the recessed surface 11k of the toner chamber frame 11 and the flat surface 12u of the image developing chamber frame 12.
      <br/>
      The aforementioned cover film 51 and tear tape 52 fit in this space.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      In order to feed the toner stored in the toner chamber frame 11 into the image developing chamber frame 12, the opening 11i of the toner chamber frame 11 must be unsealed.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished in the following manner.
      <br/>
      First, the pull-tab lit attached to the end portion 52a (FIG. 6) of the tear tape 52 extending from the process cartridge B is cut loose, or torn loose, from the toner chamber frame 11, and then, is pulled by the hand of an operator.
      <br/>
      This will tear the cover film 51 to unseal the opening 11i, enabling the toner to be fed from the toner chamber frame 11 into the image developing chamber frame 12.
      <br/>
      After the cover film 52 is pulled out of the process cartridge B, the lengthwise ends of the cartridge B are kept sealed by the elastic seals 54 and 56 which are located at the corresponding lengthwise ends of the flange 11j of the toner chamber frame 11.
      <br/>
      Since the elastic sealing members 54 and 56 are deformed (compressed) only in the direction of their thickness while maintaining their hexahedral shapes, they can keep the process cartridge sealed very effectively.
    </p>
    <p num="67">Since the side of the toner chamber frame 11, which face the image developing chamber frame 12, and the side of the image developing chamber frame 12, which faces the toner chamber frame 11, are structured as described above, the tear tape 52 can be smoothly pulled out from between the two frames 11 and 12 by simply applying to the tear tape 52 a force strong enough to tear the cover film 51.</p>
    <p num="68">
      As described above, when the toner chamber frame 11 and the image developing chamber frame 12 are united, a welding method employing ultrasonic is employed to generate frictional heat which melts the angular ridge 12v1.
      <br/>
      This frictional heat is liable to cause thermal stress in the toner chamber frame 11 and the image developing chamber frame 12, and these frames may become deformed due to the stress.
      <br/>
      However, according to this embodiment, the groove 11n of the toner chamber frame 11 and the tongue 12v of the image developing chamber frame 12 engage with each other across the almost entire length of theirs.
      <br/>
      In other words, as the two frames 11 and 12 are united, the welded portion and its adjacencies are reinforced, and therefore, the two frames are not likely to be deformed by the thermal stress.
    </p>
    <p num="69">As for the material for the toner chamber frame 11 and the image developing chamber frame 12, plastic material is used; for example, polystyrene, ABS resin (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene), polycarbonate, polyethylene, polypropylene, and the like.</p>
    <p num="70">Referring to FIG. 3, this drawing is a substantially vertical cross-section of the toner chamber frame 11 of the process cartridge B in this embodiment, and illustrates the interface between the toner chamber frame 11 and the image developing chamber frame 12, and its adjacencies.</p>
    <p num="71">
      At this time, the toner chamber frame 11 of the process cartridge B in this embodiment will be described in more detail with reference to FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The toner held in a toner container 11A is single component toner.
      <br/>
      In order to allow this toner to efficiently free fall toward the opening 11i, the toner chamber frame 11 is provided with slanted surfaces K and L, which extend across the entire length of the toner chamber frame 11.
      <br/>
      The slanted surface L is above the opening 11i, and the slanted surface K is in the rear of the toner chamber frame 11 as seen from the opening 11i (in the widthwise direction of the toner chamber frame 11).
      <br/>
      The slanted surfaces L and K are parts of the top and bottom pieces 11a and 11b, respectively, of the toner chamber frame 11.
      <br/>
      After the process cartridge B is installed in the apparatus main assembly 14, the slanted surface L faces diagonally downward, and the slanted surface K faces diagonally upward, an angle  THETA 3 between the slanted surface K and the line m perpendicular to the interface between the toner chamber frame 11 and the image developing chamber frame 12 being approximately 20 deg.-40 deg. In other words, in this embodiment, the configuration of the top portion 11a of the toner chamber frame 11 is designed so that the slanted surfaces K and L hold the aforementioned angles, respectively, after the top and bottom portions 11a and 11b of the toner chamber frame 11 are united.
      <br/>
      This, according to this embodiment, the toner container 11A holding the toner is enabled to efficiently feed the toner toward the opening 11i.
    </p>
    <p num="72">Next, the image developing chamber frame will be described in detail.</p>
    <p num="73">Image Developing Chamber Frame</p>
    <p num="74">

    <p num="75">As described before, the developing roller 9c, the developing blade 9d, the toner stirring member 9e, and the rod antenna 9h for detecting the toner remainder, are assembled into the image developing chamber frame 12.</p>
    <p num="76">
      Referring to FIG. 14, the developing blade 9d comprises an approximately 1-2 mm thick metallic plate 9d1, and an urethane rubber 9d2 glued to the metallic plate 9d1 with the use of hot melt glue, double-side adhesive tape, or the like.
      <br/>
      It regulates the amount of the toner to be carried on the peripheral surface of the developing roller 9c as the urethane rubber 9d2 is placed in contact with the generator of the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      Both the lengthwise ends of the blade mounting reference flat surface 12i, as a blade mount, of the image developing chamber frame 12, are provided with a dowel 12i1, a square projection 12i3, and a screw hole 12i2.
      <br/>
      The dowel 12i1 and the projection 12i3 are fitted in a hole 9d3 and a notch 9d5, respectively, of the metallic plate 9d1.
      <br/>
      Then, a small screw 9d6 is put through a screw hole 9d4 of the metallic plate 9d1, and is screwed into the aforementioned screw hole 12i2 with female threads, to fix the metallic plate 9d1 to the flat surface 12i.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent toner from leaking out, an elastic sealing member 12s formed of MOLTPLANE, or the like, is pasted to the image developing chamber frame 12, along the lengthwise top edge of the metallic plate 9d1.
      <br/>
      Also, an elastic sealing member 12s1 is pasted to the toner chamber frame 11, along the edge 12j of the curved bottom wall portion which accommodates the developing roller 9c, starting from each lengthwise end of the elastic sealing member 12s.
      <br/>
      Further, a thin elastic sealing member 12s2 is pasted to the image developing chamber frame 12, along a mandible-like portion 12h, in contact with the generatrix of the developing roller 9c.
    </p>
    <p num="77">The metallic plate 9d1 of the developing blade 9d is bent 90 deg. on the side opposite to the urethane rubber 9d2, forming a bent portion 9d1a.</p>
    <p num="78">
      Next, referring to FIGS. 14 and 18, the image developing roller unit G will be described.
      <br/>
      The image developing roller unit G comprises: (1) image developing roller 9c; (2) spacer roller 9i for keeping constant the distance between the peripheral surfaces of the developing roller 9c and the photosensitive drum 7, being formed of electrically insulative synthetic resin and doubling a sleeve cap which covers the developing roller 9c at each lengthwise end to prevent electrical leak between the aluminum cylinder portions of the photosensitive drum 7 and the developing roller 9c; (3) developing roller bearing 9j (illustrated in enlargement in FIG. 14); (4) developing roller gear 9k (helical gear) which receives driving force from a helical drum gear 7b attached to the photosensitive drum 7 and rotates the developing roller 9c; (5) a coil spring type contact 91, one end of which is in contact with one end of the developing roller 9c (FIG. 18); and (6) a magnet 9g which is contained in the developing roller 9c to adhere the toner onto the peripheral surface of the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 14, the bearing box 9v has been already attached to the developing roller unit G. However, in some cases, the developing roller unit G is first disposed between the side plates 12A and 12B of the image developing chamber frame 12, and then is united with the bearing box 9v when the bearing box 9v is attached to the image developing chamber frame 12.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      Referring again to FIG. 14, in the developing roller unit G, the developing roller 9c is rigidly fitted with a metallic flange 9p at one lengthwise end.
      <br/>
      This flange 9p has a developing roller gear shaft portion 9p1 which extends outward in the lengthwise direction of the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      The developing roller gear shaft portion 9p1 has a flattened portion, with which the developing roller gear 9k mounted on the developing gear shaft portion 9p1 is engaged, being prevented from rotating on the developing roller gear shaft portion 9p1.
      <br/>
      The developing roller gear 9k is a helical gear, and its teeth are angled so that the thrust generated by the rotation of the helical gear is directed toward the center of the developing roller 9c (FIG. 38).
      <br/>
      One end of the shaft of the magnet 9g, which is shaped to give it a D-shaped cross-section, projects outward through the flange 9p, and engages with the developing means gear holder 40 to be nonrotatively supported.
      <br/>
      The aforementioned developing roller bearing 9j is provided with a round hole having a rotation preventing projection 9j5 which projects into the hole, and in this round hole, the C-shaped bearing 9j4 perfectly fits.
      <br/>
      The flange 9p rotatively fits in the bearing 9j4.
      <br/>
      The developing roller bearing 9j is fitted into a slit 12f of the image developing chamber frame 12, and is supported there as the developing means gear holder 40 is fixed to the image developing chamber frame 12 by putting the projections 40g of the developing means gear holder 40 through the corresponding holes 9j1 of the developing roller gear bearing 9j, and then inserting them in the corresponding holes 12g of the image developing chamber frame 12.
      <br/>
      The bearing 9j4 in this embodiment has a C-shaped flange.
      <br/>
      However, there will be no problem even if the cross-section of the actual bearing portion of the bearing 9j4 is C-shaped.
      <br/>
      The aforementioned hole of the development roller bearing 9j, in which the bearing 9j1 fits, has a step.
      <br/>
      In other words, it is consisted of a large diameter portion and a small diameter portion, and the rotation preventing projection 9j5 is projecting from the wall of the large diameter portion in which the flange of the bearing 9j4 fit.
      <br/>
      The material for the bearing 9j, and the bearing 9f which will be described later, is polyacetal, polyamide, or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      Although substantially encased in the developing roller 9c, the magnet 9g extends from the developing roller 9c at both lengthwise ends, and is fitted in a D-shaped supporting hole 9v3 of the developing roller bearing box 9v illustrated in FIG. 18, at the end 9g1 having the D-shaped cross-section.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 18, the D-shaped supporting hole 9v3, which is located in the top portion of the developing roller bearing box 9v, is not visible.
      <br/>
      At one end of the developing roller 9c, a hollow journal 9w formed of electrically insulative material is immovably fitted within the developing roller 9c, in contact with the internal peripheral surface.
      <br/>
      A cylindrical portion 9w1 which is integral with the journal 9w and has a smaller diameter than the journal 9w electrically insulates the magnet 9g from a coil spring type contact 91 which is electrically in contact with the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      The bearing 9f with the aforementioned flange is formed of electrically insulative synthetic resin, and fits in the bearing accommodating hole 9v4 which is coaxial with the aforementioned magnet supporting hole 9v3.
      <br/>
      A key portion 9f1 integrally formed with the bearing 9f fits in a key groove 9v5 of the bearing accommodating hole 9v4, preventing the bearing 9f from rotating.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The bearing accommodating hole 9v4 has a bottom, and on this bottom, a doughnut-shaped development bias contact 121 is disposed.
      <br/>
      As the developing roller 9c is assembled into the developing roller bearing box 9v, the metallic coil spring type contact 91 comes in contact with this doughnut-shaped development bias contact 121, and is compressed, establishing thereby electrical connection.
      <br/>
      The doughnut-shaped development bias contact 121 has a lead which comprises: a first portion 121a which perpendicularly extends from the outer periphery of the doughnut-shaped portion, fitting in the recessed portion 9v6 of the bearing accommodating hole 9v4, and runs along the exterior wall of the bearing 9f up to the cutaway portion located at the edge of the bearing accommodating hole 9v4; a second portion 121b which runs from the cutaway portion, being bent outward at the cutaway portion; a third portion 121c which is bent from the second portion 121b; a fourth portion 121d which is bent from the third portion 121c in the outward, or radial, direction of the developing roller 9c; and an external contact portion 121e which is bent from the fourth portion 121d in the same direction.
      <br/>
      In order to support the development bias contact 121 having the above described shape, the developing roller bearing box 9v is provided with a supporting portion 9v8, which projects inward in the lengthwise direction of the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      The supporting portion 9v8 is in contact with the third and fourth portion 121c and 121d, and the external contact portion 121e, of the lead of the development bias contact 121.
      <br/>
      The second portion 121b is provided with an anchoring hole 121f, into which a dowel 9v9 projecting inward from the inward facing wall of the developing roller bearing box 9vin the lengthwise direction of the developing roller 9c is pressed.
      <br/>
      The external contact portion 121e of the development bias contact 121 comes in contact with the development bias contact member 125 of the apparatus main assembly 14 as the process cartridge B is installed in the apparatus main assembly 14, so that development bias is applied to the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      The development bias contact member 125 will be described later.

      Two cylindrical projections 9v1 of the developing roller bearing box 9v are fitted into the corresponding holes 12m of the image developing chamber frame 12, which are provided at the lengthwise end as illustrated in FIG. 19. As a result, the developing roller gearing box 9v is precisely positioned on the image developing chamber frame 12.
      <br/>
      Then, an unillustrated small screw is put through each screw hole of the developing roller bearing box 9v, and then is screwed into the female-threaded screw hole 12c of the image developing chamber frame 12 to fix the developing roller bearing box 9vto the image developing chamber frame 12.

    <p num="83">As is evident from the above description, in this embodiment, in order to mount the developing roller 9c in the image developing chamber frame 12, the developing roller unit G is assembled first, and then, the assembled developing roller unit G is attached to the image developing chamber frame 12.</p>
    <p num="84">
      The developing roller unit G is assembled following the steps described below.

      First, the magnet 9g is put through the developing roller 9c fitted with the flange 9p, and the journal 9w and the coil spring type contact 9l for development bias are attached to the end of the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the spacer roller 9i and the developing roller bearing 9j are fitted around each lengthwise end portion of the developing roller 9c, the developing roller bearing 9j being on the outer side relative to the lengthwise direction of the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      Then, the developing roller gear 9k is mounted on the developing roller gear shaft portion 9p1 located at the end of the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      It should be noted here that the lengthwise end 9g1 of the magnet 9g, which has a D-shaped cross-section, projects from the developing roller 9c, on the side where the developing roller 9k is attached; it projects from the end of the cylindrical portion 9w1 of the hollow journal 9w.

    <p num="85">
      Next, the rod antenna 9h for detecting the toner remainder will be described.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 14 and 19, one end of the rod antenna 19h is bent like that of a crank shaft, wherein the portion comparable to the arm portion of the crank shaft constitutes a contact portion 9h1 (toner remainder detecting contact 122), and must be electrically in contact with the toner detecting contact member 126 attached to the apparatus main assembly 14.
      <br/>
      The toner detection contact member 126 will be described later.
      <br/>
      In order to mount the rod antenna 9h in the image developing chamber frame 12, the rod antenna 9h is first inserted into the image developing chamber frame 12 through a through hole 12b of a side plate 12B of the image developing chamber frame 12, and the end which is put through the hole 12b first is placed in an unillustrated hole of the opposite side plate of the image developing chamber frame 12, so that the rod antenna 9h is supported by the side plate.
      <br/>
      In other words, the rod antenna 9h is properly positioned by the through hole 12b and the unillustrated hole on the opposite side.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent toner from invading the through hole 12b, an unillustrated sealing member (for example, a ring formed of synthetic resin, a piece of felt or sponge, or the like) is insert in the through hole 12b.
    </p>
    <p num="86">As the developing roller gear box 9v is attached to the image developing chamber frame 12, the contact portion 9h1 of the rod antenna 9h, that is, the portion comparable to the arm portion of a crank shaft, is positioned so that the rod antenna 9h is prevented from moving or coming out of the image developing chamber frame 12.</p>
    <p num="87">
      After the toner chamber frame 11 and the image developing chamber frame 12 are united, the side plate 12A of the image developing chamber frame 12, through which the rod antenna 9h is inserted, overlaps with the side plate of the toner chamber frame 11, partially covering the toner sealing cap 11f of the bottom portion 11b of the toner chamber frame 11.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 16, the side plate 12A is provided with a hole 12x, and a shaft fitting portion 9s1 (FIG. 15) of the toner feeding gear 9s for transmitting driving force to the toner feeding member 9b is put through this hole 12x.

      The dowels 40b, 40c, 40d, and 40e have a diameter of approximately 5-6 mm, and support the corresponding gears of the gear train GT.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      With the provision of the above described structure, the gears which constitute the gear train can be supported by a single component (image developing means gear holder 40).
      <br/>
      Therefore, when assembling the process cartridge B, the gear train GT can be partially preassembled onto the image developing means gear holder 40; compound components can be preassembled to simplify the main assembly process.
      <br/>
      In other words, first, the rod antenna 9h, and the toner stirring member 9e are assembled into the image developing chamber frame 12, and then, the developing roller unit G and the gear box 9v are assembled into the developing station driving force transmission unit DG and the image developing chamber frame 12, respectively, completing the image developing unit D.

    <p num="93">
      Referring to FIG. 19, an alphanumeric reference 12p designates an opening of the image developing chamber frame 12, which extends in the lengthwise direction of the image developing chamber frame 12.
      <br/>
      After the toner chamber frame 11 and the image developing chamber frame 12 are united, the opening 12p squarely meets with the opening 11i of the toner chamber frame 11, enabling the toner held in the toner chamber frame 11 to be supplied to the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      The aforementioned toner stirring member 9e and rod antenna 9h are disposed along one of the lengthwise edges of the opening 12p, across the entire length thereof.

    <p num="96">Next, referring to FIGS. 8, 9, 11, 23 and 30, connection and positioning of the contacts which establish electrical connection between the process cartridge B and the image forming apparatus main assembly 14 as the former is installed into the latter will be described.</p>
    <p num="97">
      Referring to FIG. 8, the process cartridge B has a plurality of electrical contacts: (1) cylindrical guide 13aL as an electrically conductive contact placed in contact with the photosensitive drum 7 to ground the photosensitive drum 7 through the apparatus main assembly 14 (actual ground contact is the end surface of the cylindrical guide 13aL; it is designated by a numerical reference 119 when referred to as an electrically conductive grounding contact); (2) electrically conductive charge bias contact 120 electrically connected to the charging roller shaft 8a to apply charge bias to the charging roller 8 from the apparatus main assembly 14; (3) electrically conductive development bias contact 121 electrically connected to the developing roller 9c to apply development bias to the developing roller 9c from the apparatus main assembly 14; (4) electrically conductive toner remainder detecting contact 122 electrically connected to the rod antenna 9h to detect the toner remainder.
      <br/>
      These four contacts 119-122 are exposed from the side or bottom wall of the cartridge frame.
      <br/>
      More specifically, they all are disposed so as to be exposed from the left wall or bottom wall of the cartridge frame, as seen from the direction from which the process cartridge B is installed, being separated from each other by a predetermined distance sufficient to prevent electrical leak.
      <br/>
      The grounding contact 119 and the charge bias contact 121 belong to the cleaning unit C, and the development bias contact 121 and the toner remainder detection contact 122 belong to the image developing chamber frame 12.
      <br/>
      The toner remainder detection contact 122 doubles as a process cartridge detection contact through which the apparatus main assembly 14 detects whether or not the process cartridge B has been installed in the apparatus main assembly 14.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Referring to FIG. 11, the grounding contact 119 is a part of the flange 29 formed of electrically conductive material as described before.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the photosensitive drum 7 is grounded through a grounding plate 7f electrically in connection with the drum portion 7d of the photosensitive drum 7, the drum shaft 7a which is integral with the flange 29 and the cylindrical guide 13aL and is in contact with the grounding plate 7f, and the grounding contact 119 which is the end surface of the cylindrical guide 13aL.
      <br/>
      The flange 29 in this embodiment is formed of metallic material such as steel.
      <br/>
      The charge bias contact 120 and the development bias contact 121 are formed of approximately 0.1-0.3 mm thick electrically conductive metallic plate (for example, stainless steel plate and phosphor bronze plate), and are laid (extended) along the internal surface of the process cartridge.
      <br/>
      The charge bias contact 120 is exposed from the bottom wall of the cleaning unit C, on the side opposite to the side from which the process cartridge B is driven.
      <br/>
      The development bias contact 121 and the toner remainder detection contact 122 are exposed from the bottom wall of the image developing unit D, also on the side opposite to the side from which the process cartridge B is driven.
    </p>
    <p num="99">This embodiment will be described further in detail.</p>
    <p num="100">
      As described above, in this embodiment, the helical drum gear 7b is provided at one of the axial ends of the photosensitive drum 7 as illustrated in FIG. 11. The drum gear 7b engages with the developing roller gear 9k to rotate the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      As it rotates, it generates thrust in the direction (indicated in an arrow mark d in FIG. 11).
      <br/>
      This thrust pushes the photosensitive drum 7, which is disposed in the cleaning chamber frame 13 with a slight play in the longitudinal direction, toward the side on which the drum gear 7b is mounted.
      <br/>
      Further, the reactive force, which is generated as the grounding plate 7f fixed to the spur gear 7n is pressed against the drum shaft 7a, adds to the thrust, in the direction of the arrow mark d. As a result, the outward edge 7b1 of the drum gear 7b remains in contact with the surface of the inward end of the bearing 38 fixed to the cleaning chamber frame 13.
      <br/>
      Thus, the position of the photosensitive drum 7 relative to the process cartridge B in the axial direction of the photosensitive drum 7 is regulated.
      <br/>
      The grounding contact 119 is exposed from the side plate 13k of the cleaning chamber frame 13.
      <br/>
      The drum shaft 7a extends into the base drum 7d (aluminum drum in this embodiment) coated with a photosensitive layer 7e, along the axial line.
      <br/>
      The base drum 7d and the drum shaft 7a are electrically connected through the internal peripheral surface 7d1 of the base drum 7d and the grounding plate 7f in contact with the end surface 7a1 of the drum shaft 7a.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      The charge bias contact 120 is attached to the cleaning chamber frame 13, adjacent to where the charging roller 8 is supported (FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 23, the charge bias contact 120 is electrically in contact with the shaft 8a of the charging roller 8 by way of a compound spring 8b which is in contact with the charge roller shaft 8a.
      <br/>
      This compound spring 8b is constituted of a compression spring portion 8b1 and an internal contact portion 8b2.
      <br/>
      The compression coil portion 8b1 is placed between the spring seat 120b and a charging roller bearing 8c.
      <br/>
      The internal contact portion 8b2 extends from the spring seat side end of the compression spring portion 8b1 and presses on the charge roller shaft 8a.
      <br/>
      The charging roller bearing 8c is slidably fitted in a guide groove 13g, and the spring seat 120b is located at the closed end of the guiding groove 13g.
      <br/>
      The guide groove 13g extends in the direction of an imaginary line which runs through the centers of the cross-sections of the charging roller 8 and photosensitive drum 7, the center line of the guiding groove 3g substantially coinciding with this imaginary line.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 23, the charge bias contact 120 enters the cleaning chamber frame 13 at the location where it is exposed, runs along the internal wall of the cleaning chamber frame 13, bends in the direction which intersects with the direction in which the charge roller shaft 8a of the charging roller 8 is moved, and ends at the spring seat 120b.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      Next, the development bias contact 121 and the toner remainder detection contact 122 will be described.
      <br/>
      Both contacts 121 and 122 are disposed on the bottom surface (surface of the image developing unit D, which faces downward when the process cartridge B is in the apparatus main assembly 14) of the image developing unit D, on the same side as the side plate 13k of the cleaning chamber frame 13.
      <br/>
      The aforementioned third portion 121e of the development contact 121, that is, the portion exposed from the image developing unit D, is disposed so as to oppose the charge bias contact 120 across the spur gear 7n.
      <br/>
      As described previously, the development bias contact 121 is electrically in contact with the developing roller 9c through the coil spring type contact 91 which is electrically in contact with the lengthwise end of the developing roller 9c (FIG. 18).
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      FIG. 38 schematically illustrates the relationship between the thrusts generated by the drum gear 7b and the developing roller gear 9k and the development bias contact 121.
      <br/>
      As stated before, the photosensitive drum 7 is shifted in the direction of the arrow mark d in FIG. 38 as the process cartridge B is driven.
      <br/>
      As a result, the end surface of the photosensitive drum 7 on the drum gear 7b side remains in contact with the end surface of the bearing 38 (FIG. 32) which is not illustrated in FIG. 38; the position of the photosensitive drum 7 in terms of the lengthwise direction thereof becomes fixed.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the developing roller gear 9k which meshes with the drum gear 7b is thrusted in the direction of an arrow mark e, which is opposite to the direction of the arrow mark d. As a result, it presses the coil spring type contact 91 which is pressing the development bias contact 121.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the pressure generated by the coil spring type contact 91 in the direction of an arrow mark f, that is, in the direction to press the developing roller 9c against developing roller bearing 9j, is reduced.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is assured that the coil spring type contact 91 and the development bias contact 121 never fail to remain in contact with each other, while the friction between the end surfaces of the developing roller 9c and developing roller bearing 9j is reduced to allow the developing roller 9c to rotate smoothly.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      The toner remainder detection contact 122 illustrated in FIG. 8 is attached to the image developing chamber frame 12, being exposed on the upstream side of development bias contact 121 relative to the direction in which the process cartridge B is inserted (direction of an arrow mark X in FIG. 9).
      <br/>
      As is evident from FIG. 19, the toner remainder detection contact 122 is a part of the rod antenna 9h which is formed of electrically conductive material such as metallic wire and is extended in the lengthwise direction of the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      As described previously, the rod antenna 9h stretches across the entire length of the developing roller 9c, holding a predetermined distance from the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      It comes in contact with the toner detection contact member 126 of the apparatus main assembly 14 as the process cartridge B is inserted into the apparatus main assembly 14.
      <br/>
      The capacitance between the rod antenna 9h and the developing roller 9c changes according to the amount of the toner prevent between the two.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the change in this capacitance is detected as potential difference by a control section (unillustrated) electrically connected to the toner detection contact member 126 of the apparatus main assembly 14 to determine the amount of the toner remainder.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      The toner remainder means an amount of toner which induces a predetermined amount of capacitance when the toner is placed between the developing roller 9c and the rod antenna 9h.
      <br/>
      In other word, the control section detects that the amount of the toner in the toner container 11A has been reduced to a predetermined amount; the control section of the apparatus main assembly 14 detects through the toner remainder detection contact 122 that the capacitance has reached the first predetermined value, and therefore, determines that the amount of the toner within the toner container 11A has dropped to a predetermined amount.
      <br/>
      Upon detecting that the capacitance has reached the first value, the control section of the apparatus main assembly 14 informs the user that the process cartridge B should be replaced; for example, it flashes an indicator light or sounds a buzzer.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, when the control section detects that the capacitance shows a predetermined second value which is smaller than the predetermined first value, it determines that the process cartridge B has been installed in the apparatus main assembly 14.
      <br/>
      It does not allow the image forming operation of the apparatus main assembly 14 to be started unless it detects the completion of the process cartridge B installation in the apparatus main assembly 14.
    </p>
    <p num="106">The control section may be enabled to inform the user of the absence of the process cartridge B in the apparatus main assembly 14, by flashing an indicator light, for example.</p>
    <p num="107">Next, connection between the electrical contacts of the process cartridge B and the electrical contact members of the apparatus main assembly 14 will be described.</p>
    <p num="108">Referring to FIG. 9, disposed on the internal surface of on the left-hand side wall of the cartridge accommodating space S in the image forming apparatus A are four contact members which come in contact with the aforementioned contacts 119-122 as the process cartridge B is inserted into the apparatus main assembly 14; a grounding contact member 123 which comes electrically in contact with the grounding contact 119; a charge bias contact member 124 which comes electrically in contact with the charge bias contact 120; a development bias contact member 125 which electrically come in contact with the development bias contact 121; and a toner detection contact member 126 which comes electrically in contact with the toner remainder detection contact 122.</p>
    <p num="109">
      As illustrated in FIG. 9, the grounding contact member 123 is at the bottom portion of the positioning groove 16b.
      <br/>
      The development bias contact member 125, the toner detection contact member 126, and the charging roller contact member 124 are disposed, facing upward, on the bottom surface of the cartridge accommodating space S, below the guide portion 16a and adjacent to the left-hand side wall.
      <br/>
      They are enabled to move elastically in the vertical direction.
    </p>
    <p num="110">At this point, the positional relationship between each contact and the guide will be described.</p>
    <p num="111">
      Referring to FIG. 6 which illustrates the process cartridge B in a substantially horizontal position, the toner remainder detection contact 122 is at the lowest level.
      <br/>
      The development bias contact 121 is positioned higher than the toner remainder detection contact 122, and the charge bias contact 120 is positioned higher than the development bias contact 121.
      <br/>
      The rotation controlling guide 13bL and the cylindrical guide 13aL (grounding contact 119) are positioned higher than the charge bias contact 120, being approximately at the same level.
      <br/>
      In terms of the direction (indicated by the arrow mark X) in which the process cartridge B is inserted, positioned most upstream is the toner remainder detection contact 122, and the rotation controlling guide 13bL, the development bias contact 121, the cylindrical guide 13aL (grounding contact 119), and the charge bias contact 120, are disposed in this order toward downstream.
      <br/>
      With the provision of this positional arrangement, the charge bias contact 120 is positioned close to the charging roller 8; the development bias contact 121, close to the developing roller 9c; the toner remainder detection contact 122, close to the rod antenna 9h; and the grounding contact 119 is positioned close to the photosensitive drum 7.
      <br/>
      In other words, the distance between each contact and the related component can be reduced without intricately laying a long electrode in the process cartridge B and the image forming apparatus main assembly 14.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      The dimension of the actual contact area of each contact is as follows.
      <br/>
      The charge bias contact 120 measures approximately 10.0 mm in both the horizontal and vertical directions; the development bias contact 121, approximately 6.5 mm in the vertical direction and approximately 7.5 mm in the horizontal direction; the toner remainder detection contact 122, 2.0 mm in diameter and approximately 18.0 mm in the horizontal direction; and the grounding contact 119, which is circular, measures approximately 10.0 in external diameter.
      <br/>
      The charge bias contact 120 and the development bias contact 121 are rectangular.
      <br/>
      In measuring the dimension of the contact area, "vertical" means the direction parallel to the direction X in which the process cartridge B is inserted, and "horizontal" means the direction perpendicular to the direction X.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      The grounding contact member 123 is an electrically conductive plate spring.
      <br/>
      It is disposed in the positioning groove 16b (position of the drum shaft 7a is fixed) in which the grounding contact 119 of the process cartridge B, that is, the cylindrical guide 13aL, fits (FIGS. 9, 11, and 30).
      <br/>
      It is grounded through the chassis of the apparatus main assembly 14.
      <br/>
      The toner remainder detection contact member 126 is also an electrically conductive plate spring.
      <br/>
      It is disposed adjacent to the guide portion 16a, being next to the guide portion 16a in terms of the horizontal direction, but below in terms of the vertical direction.
      <br/>
      The other contact members 124 and 125 are also disposed adjacent to the guide portion 16a, being slightly farther away from the guide portion 16a than the toner remainder detection contact member 126 is terms of the horizontal direction, and below the guide portion 16a in terms of the vertical direction.
      <br/>
      The contact members 124 and 125 are provided with a compression type coil spring 129, and therefore, they project upward from their holders 127.
      <br/>
      This arrangement will be described more specifically referring to the charging roller contact member 124.
      <br/>
      Referring to the enlarged view of the charging roller contact member 124 in FIG. 30, the charging roller contact member 124 is placed in the holder 127 so that it is allowed to project upward from the holder 127 without slipping out.
      <br/>
      Then, the holder 127 is fixed to the electrical substrate 128 attached to the apparatus main assembly 14.
      <br/>
      The contact member 124 is electrically connected to the wiring pattern through an electrically conductive compression type coil spring 129.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      Before the process cartridge B inserted in the image forming apparatus A is guided to a predetermined position by the guide portion 16a, the contact members 123-126 of the image forming apparatus A remain projected by the springs as far as they are allowed to project.
      <br/>
      In this state, none of the contact members 123-126 is in contact with their counterparts, that is, the contacts 119-122 of the process cartridge B. As the process cartridge B is inserted farther, the contact members 123-126 come in contact with the corresponding contacts 119-122 of the process cartridge B one by one.
      <br/>
      Then, as the cylindrical guide 13aL of the process cartridge B is fitted into the positioning groove 16b by additional inward movement of the process cartridge B, the contact members 123-126 of the apparatus main assembly 14 are pushed down by the corresponding contacts 119-122 of the process cartridge B against the elastic force of the compression type coil springs 129 in the holder 127.
      <br/>
      As a result, the contact pressures between the contact members 123-126 and the corresponding contacts 119-122 are increased.
    </p>
    <p num="115">As described above, according to this embodiment of the present invention, as the process cartridge B is guided to a predetermined position in the apparatus main assembly 14 by the guide member 16, the contacts of the process cartridge B reliably make contact with the contact members of the apparatus main assembly 14.</p>
    <p num="116">
      As the process cartridge B is installed in the predetermined position, the grounding contact member 123, which is in the form of a plate spring, comes in contact with the grounding contact 119 which is projecting from the cylindrical guide 13aL (FIG. 11); the grounding contact 119 is electrically connected to the grounding contact member 123, and as a result, the photosensitive drum 7 is grounded.
      <br/>
      The charge bias contact 120 and the charging roller contact member 124 becomes electrically connected to allow high voltage (voltage composed by superposing AC voltage and DC voltage) to be applied to the charging roller 8.
      <br/>
      The development bias contact 121 and the development bias contact member 125 make electrical connection to each other to allow high voltage to be applied to the developing roller 9c.
      <br/>
      The toner remainder detection contact 122 comes electrically in contact with the toner detection contact member 126, and information reflecting the capacitance between the developing roller 9c and the rod antenna 9h (contact 122) is transmitted to the apparatus main assembly 14 through the contact 122.
    </p>
    <p num="117">Further, the contacts 119-122 of the process cartridge B are disposed on the bottom side of the process cartridge B, and therefore, the reliability of contact between the contacts 119-122 and the corresponding contact members is not affected by the accuracy in their positional relationship in terms of the direction perpendicular to the direction of the arrow X in which the process cartridge B is inserted.</p>
    <p num="118">
      Further, all the contacts of the process cartridge B are positioned on one side of the cartridge frame.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the mechanical members and the electrical wiring members of the image forming apparatus main assembly 14 and the process cartridge B can be separately positioned on the appropriate sides of the cartridge accommodating space S, and the process cartridge B, to reduce the number of assembly steps and simplify the maintenance.
    </p>
    <p num="119">As the lid 35 is closed after the process cartridge B is inserted into the image forming apparatus main assembly 14, the coupling device on the process cartridge side connects with the coupling device on the apparatus main assembly side in synchronism with the movement of the lid 35, enabling the photosensitive drum 7 and the like to receive driving force from the apparatus main assembly 14 to be rotated.</p>
    <p num="120">Further, since all electrical contacts of the process cartridge B are disposed on one side of the cartridge frame, reliable electrical connection can be established between the image forming apparatus main assembly 14 and the process cartridge B.</p>
    <p num="121">Further, positioning each electrical contact in the above described manner makes it possible to reduce the distance the corresponding electrode must be routed in the cartridge frame.</p>
    <p num="122">Coupling and Driving Structure</p>
    <p num="123">The description will be made as to a structure of coupling means which is a drive transmission mechanism for transmitting the driving force to the process cartridge B from the main assembly 14 of the image forming apparatus.</p>
    <p num="124">Referring to FIG. 11, there is shown a longitudinal sectional view of a coupling portion wherein the photosensitive drum 7 is mounted to the process cartridge B.</p>
    <p num="125">
      Cartridge side coupling means is provided to one longitudinal end of the photosensitive drum 7 mounted to the process cartridge B, as shown in FIG. 11. The coupling means is in the form of a male coupling shaft 37 (circular column configuration) formed on a drum flange 36 fixed to the one end of the photosensitive drum 7.
      <br/>
      The end surface 37a1 of the projection 37a is parallel with the end surface of the male shaft 37.
      <br/>
      The male shaft 37 is engageable with a bearing 38 to function as a drum shaft.
      <br/>
      In this example, the drum flange 36, male coupling shaft 37 and the projection 37a are integrally formed.
      <br/>
      The drum flange 36 is integrally provided with a helical drum gear 7b to transmit the driving force to the developing roller 9c in the process cartridge B. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 11, the drum flange 36 is an integrally molded product of plastic resin material having a drum gear (helical gear) 7b, male shaft 37, and the projection 37a to constitute a driving force transmitting part having a function of transmitting a driving force.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      The projection 37a has a configuration of twisted prism, and more particularly, it has a cross-section of substantially equilateral triangle, and is gradually twisted to a small extent in the axial direction.
      <br/>
      The corner portion of the prism is rounded.
      <br/>
      The recess 39a for engaging with the projection 37a has a cross-section of polygonal shape, and is gradually twisted to a small extent in the axial direction.
      <br/>
      The projection 37a and the recess 39a are twisted in the same direction with the same twisting pitch.
      <br/>
      The section of said recess 39a is of a substantially triangular shape in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      The recess 39a is provided in a female coupling shaft 39b which is integral with a gear 43 in the main assembly 14 of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      The female coupling shaft 39b is rotatable and movable in the axial direction relative to the main assembly 14 of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      With this structure of this example, when the process cartridge B is mounted to the main assembly 14 of the apparatus, the projection 37a enters the recess 39a provided in the main assembly 14.
      <br/>
      When the recess 39a starts to rotate, the recess 39a and the projection 37a are brought into engagement with each other.
      <br/>
      When the rotating force oft recess 39a is transmitted to the projection 37a, the edge lines 37a2 of the substantially equilateral triangle projection 37a and the inner surfaces 39a2 of the recess 39a, are uniformly contacted to each other, and therefore, the axes are aligned.
      <br/>
      To accomplish this, the diameter of the circumscribed circle R0 of the male coupling projection 37a is larger than that of the inscribed circle R1 of the female coupling recess 39a, and is smaller than that of the circumscribed circle R2 of the female coupling recess 3a.
      <br/>
      The twisting produces such a force that projection 37a is pulled toward the recess 39a, so that end surface of the projection 37a1 is abutted to the bottom 39a1 of the recess 39a.
      <br/>
      Thus, a thrust force is produced to urge the drum gear 7b in the direction of an arrow d, and therefore, the photosensitive drum 7 integral with the projection 37a1 is stably positioned in the main assembly 14 of the image forming apparatus both in the axial direction and in the radial direction.
    </p>
    <p num="127">In this example, the twisting direction of the projection 37a is opposite from the rotational direction of the photosensitive drum 7 in the direction from the bottom trunk of the projection 37a toward the free end thereof, as seen from the photosensitive drum 7; the twisting direction of the recess 39a is opposite in the direction from the inlet of the recess 39a toward the inside; and the twisting direction of the drum gear 7b of the drum flange 36 is opposite from the twisting direction of the projection 37a.</p>
    <p num="128">
      The male shaft 37 and the projection 37a are provided on the drum flange 36 such that when the drum flange 36 is mounted to end of the photosensitive drum 7, they are coaxial with the axis of the photosensitive drum 7.
      <br/>
      Designated by 36b is an engaging portion which is engaged with the inner surface of the drum cylinder 7d when the drum flange 36 is mounted to the photosensitive drum 7.
      <br/>
      The drum flange 36 is mounted to the photosensitive drum 7 by crimping or bonding.

      The circumference of the drum cylinder 7d is coated with a photosensitive layer 7e.

    </p>
    <p num="131">The twisted projection 37 is provided at a longitudinal end of said photosensitive drum 7, and has a non-circular cross-section and substantially coaxial with a rotation axis of said photosensitive drum 7, wherein said projection 37 of said photosensitive drum 7 has such a dimension and configuration that it can take a first relative rotational position with respect to a recess 39a of the driving rotatable member (main assembly side gear 43) in which relative rotational movement therebetween is permitted, and a second relative rotational position with respect to said recess 39a of said driving rotatable member in which relative rotational movement is prevented in one rotational direction, while the rotation axis of said driving rotatable member and the rotation axis of said photosensitive drum 7 are substantially aligned.</p>

      <br/>
      The projection 37a of the male coupling shaft 37 is protected when, for example, the process cartridge B is mounted or demounted, and therefore, it is not damaged or deformed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the possible play or vibration during driving through the coupling due to damage of the projection 37a, can be prevented.

      The main assembly 14 of the image forming apparatus is provided with coupling means of the main assembly.
      <br/>
      The coupling means of the main assembly has a female coupling shaft 39b (circular column configuration) at a position aligned with the rotation axis of the photosensitive drum when the process cartridge B is inserted (FIG. 11, 25).
      <br/>
      The female coupling shaft 39b, as shown in FIG. 11, is a driving shaft integral with a large gear 43 for transmitting the driving force to the photosensitive drum 7 from the motor 61.
      <br/>
      The female shaft 39b is projected from the lateral edge of the large gear 43 at the center of rotation of the large gear 43.
      <br/>
      In this example, the large gear 43 and the female coupling shaft 39b are integrally molded.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      The large gear 43 in the main assembly 14 is a helical gear, which is in meshing engagement with a small helical gear 62 fixed to or integral with the shaft 61a of the motor 61; the twisting directions and the inclination angles thereof are such that when the driving force is transmitted from the small gear 62, female shaft 39b is moved toward the male shaft 37 by the thrust force produced.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the motor 61 is driven for the image formation, the female shaft 39b is moved toward the male shaft 37 by the thrust force to establish engagement between the recess 39a and the projection 37a.
      <br/>
      The recess 39a is provided at the end of the female shaft 39b in alignment with the center of rotation of the female shaft 39b.
    </p>
    <p num="141">In this embodiment, the driving force is directly transmitted from the small gear 62 of the motor shaft 61a to the large gear 43, but it may be transmitted through a speed reduction gear train, belt-pulley means, a couple of friction rollers, a combination of a timing belt and a pulley.</p>
    <p num="142">Referring to FIG. 24, 27 to FIG. 29, the description will be made as to a structure for engaging the recess 39a and the projection 37a in interrelation with the closing operation of the openable cover 35.</p>
    <p num="143">
      As shown in FIG. 29, a side plate 67 is fixed between the large gear 43 and the side plate 66 in the main assembly 14, and the female coupling shaft 39b coaxially integral with the large gear 43 is rotatably supported by the side plates 66, 67.
      <br/>
      An outer cam 63 and an inner cam 64 are closely inserted into between the large gear 43 and the side plate 66.
      <br/>
      The inner cam 64 is fixed to the side plate 66, and the outer cam 63 is rotatably engaged with the female coupling shaft 39b.
      <br/>
      The surfaces of the outer cam 63 and the inner cam 64 which are substantially perpendicular to the axial direction and which are faced to each other, are cam surfaces, and are screw surfaces coaxial with the female coupling shaft 39b and are contacted to each other.
      <br/>
      Between the large gear 43 and the side plate 67, a compression coil spring 68 is compressed and fitted around the female coupling shaft 39b.
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      As shown in FIG. 27, an arm 63a is extended from an outer periphery of the outer cam 63 in a radial direction, and an end of the arm 63a is coupled with an end of a link 65 by a pin 65a at a position opposite from the opening side when the openable cover 35 is closed.
      <br/>
      The other end of the link 65 is combined with an end of the arm 63a by a pin 65b.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      FIG. 28 is a view as seen from the right in FIG. 27, and when the openable cover 35 is closed, the link 65, outer cam 63 and the like are at the positions shown in the Figure, where the male coupling projection 37a and the recess 39a are engaged so that driving force can be transmitted from the large gear 43 to the photosensitive drum 7.
      <br/>
      When the openable cover 35 is opened, the pin 65a is rotated upward about the fulcrum 35a, so that arm 63a is pulled up through the link 65, and the outer cam 63 is rotated; thus, relative sliding motion is caused between the outer cam 63 and the inner cam 64 to move the large gear 43 away from the photosensitive drum 7.
      <br/>
      At this time, the large gear 43 is pushed by the outer cam 63, and is moved against the compression coil spring 68 mounted between the side plate 67 and the large gear 39, by which the female coupling recess 39a is disengaged from the male coupling projection 37a as shown in FIG. 29 to release the coupling to bring the process cartridge B into demountable state.
    </p>
    <p num="146">
      On the contrary, when the openable cover 35 is closed, the pin 65a connecting the link 65 with the openable cover 35, is rotated downward about the fulcrum 35a, and the link 65 is moved downward to push the arm 63a down, so that outer cam 63 is rotated in the opposite direction, by which the large gear 43 is moved to the left by the spring 68 to a position shown in FIG. 28, so that large gear 43 is set again at a position of FIG. 28, and the female coupling recess 39a is engaged with the male coupling projection 37a to re-establish a drive transmittable state.
      <br/>
      Thus, the demountable state and the drive transmittable state of the process cartridge B are established in response to opening and closing of the openable cover 35.
      <br/>
      When the outer cam 63 is rotated in the opposite direction by the closing of the openable cover 35 to move the large gear 43 to the left from the position of FIG. 29, the female coupling shaft 39b and the end surface of the male coupling shaft 37 may be abutted to each other so that male coupling projection 37a and the female coupling recess 39a may not be engaged with each other.
      <br/>
      However, they will be brought into engagement as soon as starting of the image forming apparatus A, as will be described hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      Thus, in this embodiment, when the process cartridge B is mounted to or demounted from the main assembly 14 of the apparatus, the openable cover 35 is opened.
      <br/>
      In interrelation with the opening and closing of the openable cover 35, the female coupling recess 39a is moved in the horizontal direction (the direction of arrow j).
      <br/>
      When the process cartridge B is mounted to or demounted from the main assembly 14, the coupling (37a, 39a) of the main assembly 14 and the process cartridge B are not to be engaged.
      <br/>
      And, they should not be engaged.
      <br/>
      Thus, the mounting-and-demounting of the process cartridge B relative to the main assembly 14 can be carried out smoothly.
      <br/>
      In this example, the female coupling recess 39a is urged toward the process cartridge B by the large gear 43 being urged by the compression coil spring 68.
      <br/>
      When the male coupling projection 37a and the recess 39a are to be brought into engagement, they may be abutted to each other, and therefore, they are not properly engaged.
      <br/>
      When, however, the motor 61 is first rotated after the process cartridge B is mounted to the main assembly 14, the female coupling recess 39a is rotated, by which they are instantaneously brought into engagement.
    </p>
    <p num="148">The description will be made as to the configurations of the projection 37a and the recess 39a constituting the engaging portion of the coupling means.</p>
    <p num="149">
      The female coupling shaft 39b provided in the main assembly 14 is movable in the axial, as described hereinbefore, but it not movable in the radial direction (radial direction).
      <br/>
      The process cartridge B is movable in its longitudinal direction and the cartridge mounting direction (x direction (FIG. 9)) when it is mounted in the main assembly.
      <br/>
      In the longitudinal direction, the process cartridge B is permitted to move between the guiding members 16R, 16L provided in the cartridge mounting space S.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      When the process cartridge B is mounted to the main assembly 14, a portion of a cylindrical guide 13aL (FIG. 6, 7 and FIG. 9) formed on the flange 29 mounted to the other longitudinal end of the cleaning frame 13, is fitted substantially without gap into the positioning groove 16b (FIG. 9) of the main assembly 14 to accomplish correct positioning, and the spur gear 7n fixed to the photosensitive drum 7 is brought into meshing engagement with a gear (unshown) for transmitting the driving force to the transfer roller 4.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, at one longitudinal end (driving side) of the photosensitive drum 7, a cylindrical guide 13aR formed on the cleaning frame 13, is supported by a positioning groove 16d provided in the main assembly 14.
    </p>
    <p num="151">By the cylindrical guide 13aR being supported in the positioning groove 16d of the main assembly 14, the drum shaft 7a and the female shaft 39b are aligned with the deviation not more than 2.00 mm, so that first aligning function in the coupling action process is accomplished.</p>
    <p num="152">By closing the openable cover 35, the female coupling recess 39a is moved horizontally to enter the projection 37a.</p>
    <p num="153">Then, at the driving side (coupling side), the positioning and the drive transmission are carried out as follows.</p>
    <p num="154">When the driving motor 61 of the main assembly 14 is rotated, the female coupling shaft 39b is moved toward the male coupling shaft 37 (the direction opposite from the direction of arrow d in FIG. 11), and when the phase alignment is reached between the male coupling projection 37a and the recess 39a (in this embodiment, the projection 37a and the recess 39a have substantially equilateral triangle configurations, the phase alignment is reach at each 120 degrees rotation), they are brought into engagement, so that rotating force is transmitted to the process cartridge B from the main assembly 14 (from the state shown in FIG. 29 to the state shown in FIG. 28).</p>
    <p num="155">The sizes of the equilateral triangles of the male coupling projection 37a and the recess 39a are different, more particularly, the cross-section of the triangular recess of the female coupling recess 39a is larger than the cross-section of the triangular projection of the male coupling projection 37a, and therefore, they are smoothly bought into engagement.</p>
    <p num="156">The lower limit of the inscribed circle diameter of the triangular shape of the projection is about 8.0 mm from the standpoint of the necessary rigidity, and in this embodiment, it is 8.5 mm, and the inscribed circle diameter of the triangular shape of the recess is 9.5 mm, so that gap is 0.5 mm.</p>
    <p num="157">In order to establish engagement of coupling with small gap, it is desirable to establish a certain degree of alignment before the engagement.</p>
    <p num="158">In this embodiment, in order to provide the concentricity of 1.0 mm desirable for the engagement with the gap of 0.5 mm, the projection length of the projection 38 of the cylindrical bearing is made longer than the projection length of the male coupling projection 37a, and the outside circumference of the female shaft 39a is guided by more than two projected guides 13aR4 provided in the projection 38a of the bearing, by which the concentricity before the coupling engagement between the projection 37 and the female shaft 39a is maintained at less than 1.0 mm, so as to stabilize the engaging action of the coupling (second aligning function).</p>
    <p num="159">
      When the image forming operation is started, the female coupling shaft 39b is rotated while the male coupling projection 37a is in the recess 39a, the inner surfaces of the female coupling recess 39a are brought into abutment to the three edge lines of the substantially equilateral triangular prism of the projection 37a, so that driving force is transmitted.
      <br/>
      At this time, the male coupling shaft 37 is moved to be aligned with the female shaft 39b such that inner surfaces of the female coupling recess 39a of the regular prism are uniformly contacted to the edge lines of the projection 37a.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      Thus, the alignment between the male coupling shaft 37 and the female shaft 39b, are automatically established by the actuation of the motor 61.
      <br/>
      By the driving force transmitted to the photosensitive drum 7, the process cartridge B tends to rotate, by which a regulating abutment 13j (FIGS. 4, 5, FIGS. 6, 7 and FIG. 30) formed on the upper surface of the cleaning frame 13 of the process cartridge B, is urged to the fixing member 25 (FIGS. 9, 10 and FIG. 30) fixed to the main assembly 14 of the image forming apparatus, thus correctly positioning the process cartridge B relative to the main assembly 14.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      When the driving is not effected (image forming operation is not carried out), the gap is provided in the radial direction between the male coupling projection 37a and the recess 39a, so that engagement and disengagement of the coupling are easy.
      <br/>
      When the driving is effected, the urging force is provided with stabilization, so that play or vibration there can be suppressed.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      In this embodiment, the male coupling projection and recess have substantially the equilateral triangle shapes, but the same effects can be provided when they are substantially regular polygonal configuration.
      <br/>
      Substantially regular polygonal configuration is desirable since then the positioning can be effected with high precision, but this is not limiting, and another polygonal shape is usable if the engagement is established with axial force.
      <br/>
      The male coupling projection may be in the form of a male screw having a large lead, and the female coupling recess may be in the form of a complementary female screw.
      <br/>
      In such a case, triangle male and female screws having three leads corresponds the foregoing male coupling projection and female recess.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      When the male coupling projection and the female recess are compared, the projection is more easily damaged, and has poorer mechanical strength.
      <br/>
      In view of this, this embodiment is such that male coupling projection is provided in the exchangeable process cartridge B, and the female coupling recess is provided in the main assembly 14 of the image forming apparatus which is required to have a higher durability than the process cartridge.
      <br/>
      However, the process cartridge B may have a recess, and the main assembly may have the projection, correspondingly.

      A rear surface of the right-hand guiding member 13R has an integral bearing 38 concentric with the cylindrical guide 13aR and having a small diameter, as shown in FIGS. 33, 34. The bearing 38 is extended to a cylindrical end thereof through a disk member 13aR3 provided at an axially (longitudinally) middle portion of the cylindrical guide 38aR.
      <br/>
      Between the bearing 38 and the cylindrical guide 13aR, a circular groove 38aR4 open to inside of the cleaning frame 13, is formed.

      As shown in FIGS. 33, 35, a side surface of the cleaning frame 13 is provided with a partly circular cylindrical shape hole 13h for receiving the bearing, and the lacking circle portion 13h1 has faced end portions with a gap therebetween smaller than the diameter of the bearing mounting hole 13h and larger than the diameter of the coupling projected shaft 37.
      <br/>
      Since the coupling projected shaft 37 is engaged with the bearing 38, it is spaced from the bearing mounting hole 13h.
      <br/>
      A positioning pin 13h2 is formed integrally on the side surface of the cleaning frame 13, and is fitted closely into the flange 13aR1 of the guiding member 13R.
      <br/>
      By dosing so, the photosensitive drum 7 in the form of an unit can be mounted to the cleaning frame 13 in a transverse direction crossing with the axial direction (longitudinal direction), and the position of the right-hand guiding member 13R is correctly determined relative to the cleaning frame when the right-hand guiding member 13R is mounted to the cleaning frame 13 in the longitudinal direction.

      When the photosensitive drum 7 unit is to be mounted to the cleaning frame 13, the photosensitive drum 7 unit is moved in the direction crossing with the longitudinal direction, as shown in FIG. 33, to insert it into the bearing mounting hole 13h while moving the male coupling shaft 37 through the lacking circle portion 13h1 with the drum gear 7b being inside the cleaning frame 13.

      With this state, the drum shaft 7a integral with the left-hand guide 13aL shown in FIG. 11 inserted through a lateral edge 13k of the cleaning frame 13 to be engaged with the spur gear 7n, and a small screw 13dis threaded through the flange 29 of the guide 13aL into the cleaning frame 13, thus fixing the guide 13aL to the cleaning frame to support one end portion of the photosensitive drum 7.

    <p num="170">
      In this manner, the photosensitive drum 7 is correctly and securedly fixed to the cleaning frame 13.

      Since the photosensitive drum 7 is mounted to the cleaning frame 13 in the direction transverse to the longitudinal direction, the longitudinal end structures are simplified, and the longitudinal dimension of the cleaning frame 13 can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the main assembly 14 of the image forming apparatus can be downsized.

      The right-hand side cylindrical guide 13aR is coaxial with and integral with the bearing 38 support sing the photosensitive drum 7.

    <p num="171">
      The left side cylindrical guide 13aL, the large area flange 29 and the drum shaft 7a projected from the flange 29, are of integral metal, and therefore, the position of the drum shaft 7a is correct, and the durability is improved.
      <br/>
      The cylindrical guide 13aL is not worn even if the process cartridge B is repeatedly mounted to or demounted from the main assembly 14 of the image forming apparatus.

      As described hereinbefore in connection with the electric contacts, the electrical ground of the photosensitive drum 7 is easy.
      <br/>
      The right-hand side cylindrical guide 13aL has a larger diameter than the bearing 38, and the bearing 38 and the cylindrical guide 13aR are coupled by a disk member 13aR3.
      <br/>
      The cylindrical guide 13aR is coupled with the flange 13aR1, and therefore, the cylindrical guide 13aR and the bearing 38 are reinforced and stiffened each other.
      <br/>
      Since the right-hand cylindrical guide 13aR has a large diameter, it has enough durability against the repeated mounting-and-demounting of the process cartridge B relative to the image forming apparatus, although it is made of synthetic resin material.
    </p>
    <p num="172">FIGS. 36, 37 are developed view in the longitudinal section illustrating another mounting method of the bearing 38 integral with the right-hand guiding member 13R to the cleaning frame 13.</p>
    <p num="173">These are schematic views and show the bearing 38 of the photosensitive drum 7 as a major part.</p>
    <p num="174">
      As shown in FIG. 36, there is provided a rib 13h3 extended circumferential at the outside edge of the bearing mounting hole 13h, and the outer periphery of the rib 13h3 is a part of a cylindrical configuration.
      <br/>
      In this example, a portion of the right-hand cylindrical guide 13aR extended beyond the disk member 13aR3 to the flange 13aR1, is closely fitted around the outer periphery of the rib 13h3.
      <br/>
      The bearing mounting portion 13h of the bearing 38 and the outer periphery of the bearing 38 are loosely fitted.
      <br/>
      With this structure, although the bearing mounting portion 13h is non-continuous because of the lacking circle portion 13h1, the opening of the lacking circle portion 13h1 can be prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="175">For the same purpose, a plurality of confining boss 13h4 may be provided at the outer periphery of the rib 13h3, as shown in FIG. 34.</p>
    <p num="176">The confining boss 13h4 is manufactured by metal mold with the following accuracy, for example; IT tolerance of 9 the grade for the circumscribed circle diameter, and the concentricity of -0.01 mm or less relative to the inside circumference of the mounting hole 13h.</p>
    <p num="177">When the drum bearing 38 is mounted to the cleaning frame 13, an inner peripheral surface 13aR5 of the drum shaft 38 opposed to the outside circumference confines the confining boss 13h4 of the cleaning frame 13, while the mounting hole 13h of the cleaning frame 13 and the outside circumference of the bearing 38 are engaged, so that possible misalignment during assembling due to the opening of the lacking circle portion 13h1 can be prevented.</p>
    <p num="178">Structure for Connecting Cleaning Chamber Frame (Drum Chamber Frame) and Image Developing Chamber Frame</p>
    <p num="179">As stated previously, the cleaning chamber frame 13 and image developing chamber frame 12 of the process cartridge B are united after the charging roller 8 and the cleaning means 10 are assembled into the cleaning chamber frame 13 and the developing means 9 is assembled into the image developing chamber frame 12.</p>
    <p num="180">
      The essential characteristics of the structure which units the drum chamber frame 13 and the image developing chamber frame 12 will be described below with reference to FIGS. 12, 13 and 32.
      <br/>
      In the following description, "right-hand side and left-hand side" means the right-hand side and left-hand side as seen from above, with reference to the direction in which the recording medium 2 is conveyed.
    </p>
    <p num="181">The process cartridge removably installable in the main assembly 14 of an electrophotographic image forming apparatus comprises: an electrophotographic photosensitive drum 7; a developing means 9 for developing a latent image formed on the electrophotographic photosensitive drum 7; an image developing chamber frame 12 which supports the developing means 9; a drum chamber frame 13 which supports the electrophotographic photosensitive drum 7; a toner chamber frame 11 which houses toner storing portion; a compression type coil spring, one end of which is attached to the image developing chamber frame 12, being located above one of the lengthwise ends of the developing means, and the other end of which is in contact with the drum chamber frame 13; a first projection (right-hand side arm portion 19) which is projecting from the image developing chamber frame 12 in the direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of the developing means 9, being located above the lengthwise end of the developing means 9; a second projection (left-hand side arm portion 19); a first hole (right-hand side hole 20) of the first projection; a second hole (left-hand side hole 20) of the second projection; a first joint portion (recessed portion 21 on the right-hand side) which is located in the right-hand side lengthwise end of the drum chamber frame 13, above the electrophotographic photosensitive drum 7, and engages with the first projection (arm portion 19 on the right-hand side); a second joint portion (recessed portion 21 on the left-hand side) which is located in the left-hand side lengthwise end of the drum chamber frame 13, above the photosensitive drum 7, and is engaged with the second projection (arm portion 19 on the left-hand side); a third hole (hole 13e illustrated on the right-hand side in FIG. 12) of the first joint portion (recessed portion 21 on the right-hand side); a fourth hole (hole 13e illustrated on the left-hand side in FIG. 12) of the second joint portion (recessed portion 21 on the left-hand side); a first penetration member (joining member 22 on the right-hand side in FIG. 12) which is put through the first hole (right hole 20 and the third hole (right hole 13e), with the first projection (right arm portion 19) and the first joint portion (right recessed portion 21) being engaged with each other, to connect the drum chamber frame 13 and the image developing chamber frame 12; a second penetrating member (joining member 22 on the left-hand side in FIG. 12) which is put through the second hole (left hole 20) and the fourth hole (left hole 13e), with the second projection (left arm portion 19) and the second joint portion (left recessed portion 21) being engaged with each other, to connect the drum chamber frame 13 and the image developing chamber frame 12.</p>
    <p num="182">
      The image developing chamber frame 12 and drum chamber frame 13 of the process cartridge B, which are structured as described above, are joined through the following steps: the first joining step for joining the first projection (right arm portion 19) of the image developing chamber frame 12 and the first joint portion (right recessed portion 21) of the drum chamber frame 13; the second joining step for joining the second projection (left arm portion 19) and the second joint portion (left recessed portion 21); the first penetrating step for putting the first penetrating member (right joining member 22) through the first hole (right hole 20) of the first projection (right arm portion 19) and the third hole (right hole 13e) of the first joint portion (right recessed portion 21), with the first projection (right arm portion 19) and the first joint portion (right recessed portion 21) being engaged with each other, to connect the drum chamber frame 13 and the image developing chamber frame 12; the the second penetrating step for putting the second penetrating member (left joining member 22) through the second hole (left hole 30) of the second projection (left arm portion 19) and the fourth hole (left hole 20) of the second joint portion (left recessed portion 21, with the second projection (left arm portion 19) and the second joint portion (left recessed portion 21) being engaged with each other, to connect the image developing chamber frame 12 and the drum chamber frame 13.
      <br/>
      After being joined with each other through the above described steps, the image developing chamber frame 12 and the drum chamber frame 13 together constitute the process cartridge B.
    </p>
    <p num="183">According to this embodiment, the image developing chamber frame 12 and the drum chamber frame 13 can be easily joined simply putting the joining member 22 through their connective portions, and also can be easily separated simply by pulling the joining member 22 out, as is evident from the above description.</p>
    <p num="184">
      Among the above described steps, the developing means 9 comprises the developing roller 9c in advance, and the first joining step for joining the first projection and the first joint portion, and the second joining step for joining the second projection and the second joint portion, are carried out at the same time, wherein
      <br/>
      (1) the photosensitive drum 7 and the developing roller 9c are held in parallel;
      <br/>
      (2) the developing roller 9c is moved along the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 7;
      <br/>
      (3) the image developing chamber frame 12 is rotatively moved as the developing roller 9c is moved;
      <br/>
      (4) the first and second projections (arm portions 19 on the right- and left-hand sides) enter the first and second joint portions (recesses 21 on the right- and left-hand sides) due to the rotative movement of the image developing chamber frame 12;
      <br/>
      (5) the first and second projections (both arm portions 19) fully engage with the first and second joint portions (both recessed portions 21).
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      With the above steps being strictly followed, the arm portion 19 can be moved toward the recessed portion 21 by circularly moving the developing roller 9c along the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 7, with lengthwise ends of the photosensitive drum 7 having been already fitted with the spacer roller 9i.
      <br/>
      Thus, the point at which the arm portion 19 and the recessed portion 21 join becomes fixed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the configuration of the arm portion 19 and the recessed portion 21 can be designed to make it easier to align the hole 20 of the arm portion 19 of the image developing chamber frame 12 and the holes 13a of both side walls of the recessed portion 21.
    </p>
    <p num="186">As stated previously, it is common practice to unit the image developing unit D and the cleaning unit C after the image developing unit D is formed by joining the toner chamber frame 11 and image developing chamber frame 12, and the cleaning chamber frame 13 and the charging roller 8 are assembled into the cleaning unit C.</p>
    <p num="187">The image developing chamber frame 12 and the drum chamber frame 13 are designed so that the holes 20 of the first and second projections, respectively, and the holes 13e of the first and second joint portions, respectively, become substantially aligned as the image developing chamber frame 12 and the drum chamber frame 13 are placed in contact with each other following the steps described above.</p>
    <p num="188">
      Referring to FIG. 32, the profile of the tip 19a of the arm portion 19 forms an arc whose center coincides with the center of the hole 20, and the profile of the bottom portion 21a of the recessed portion 21 forms an arc whose center coincides with the center of the hole 13e.
      <br/>
      The radius of the arc-shaped portion of the tip 19a of the arm portion 19 is slightly smaller than the radius of the arc-shaped bottom portion 21a of the recessed portion 21.
      <br/>
      This slight difference in radius between the arm portion 19 and the recessed portion 21 is such that when the bottom 21a of the recess is placed in contact with the tip 19a of the arm portion 19, the joining member 22 with a chamfered tip can be easily put through the hole 13e of the drum chamber frame 13 (cleaning chamber frame 13) and then inserted into the hole 20 of the arm portion 19.
      <br/>
      As the joining member 22 is inserted, an arc-shaped gap is formed between the tip 19 of the arm portion 19 and the bottom 21a of the recessed portion 21, and the arm portion 19 is rotatively supported by the joining member 22.
      <br/>
      The gap g in FIG. 32 is exaggerated for ease of depiction, but the actual gap g is smaller than the size of the chamfered portion of the tip of the joining member 22 or the size of the chamfered edge of the hole 20.
    </p>
    <p num="189">
      Also referring to FIG. 32, when the image developing chamber frame 12 and drum chamber frame 13 are joined, they are moved so that the hole 20 of the arm portion 19 forms a locus RL1 or RL2, or a locus which falls between the loci RL1 and RL2.
      <br/>
      The interior surface 20a of the top wall of the recessed portion 21 is angled so that the compression type coil spring 22a is gradually compressed as the image developing chamber frame 12 and drum chamber frame 13 are moved toward each other as described above.
      <br/>
      In other words, the image developing chamber frame 12 and the drum chamber frame 13 are shaped so that as they are moved toward each other as described above, the distance between the portion of the image developing chamber frame 12, to which the compression type spring 22a is attached, and the aforementioned interior surface 20a of the top wall of the recessed portion 21, is gradually reduced.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the top end of the compression type coil spring 22a comes in contact with a portion 20a1 of the slanted interior surface 20a in the middle of the joining process, and after the image developing chamber frame 12 and the drum chamber frame 13 are completely joined, the compression type coil spring 22a remains in contact with a spring seat portion 20a2 of the slanted interior surface 20a, which continues from the slanted portion 20a1.
      <br/>
      The axial line of the compression type coil spring 22a and the plane of the spring seat portion 20a2 perpendicularly intersect.
    </p>
    <p num="190">
      Because the image developing chamber frame 12 and the drum chamber frame 13 are structured as described above, it is unnecessary to compress the compression type coil spring 22a with the use of a dedicated compression means when the image developing chamber frame 12 and the drum chamber frame 13 are united; the spring 22a is automatically placed in a proper position to press the developing roller 9c against the photosensitive drum 7.
      <br/>
      In other words, the compression type coil spring 22a can be attached to the spring seat 12t of the image developing chamber frame 12 before the image developing chamber frame 12 and the drum chamber frame 13 are united.
    </p>
    <p num="191">The locus RL1 coincides with the circle whose center coincides with the center of the cross-section of the photosensitive drum 7, and the locus RLs is substantially a straight line whose distance from the slanted surface 20a1 gradually reduces from the right-hand side of the drawing toward the left-hand side.</p>
    <p num="192">
      Referring to FIG. 31, the compression type coil spring 22a is held by the image developing chamber frame 12.
      <br/>
      FIG. 31 is a vertical section of the image developing chamber frame 12, at a vertical plane passed through the base of the arm portion 19, in parallel to the direction X in which the process cartridge B is inserted.
      <br/>
      The image developing chamber frame 12 has the spring holding portion 12t which protrudes upward from the top surface of the image developing chamber frame 12.
      <br/>
      This spring holding portion 12t comprises at least a spring holding cylindrical base portion 12k around which the compression type coil spring 22a is press-fitted, and a guide portion 12 which is given a smaller diameter than the base portion 12k so that the compression type coil spring 22a can be loosely fitted around it.
      <br/>
      The height of the spring holding base portion 12k must be greater than the height the bottommost loop of the compression type coil spring 22a reaches when the compression type coil spring 22a is in the least compressed state, and is desirable to be the height the second loop of the spring 22a reaches, or greater.
    </p>
    <p num="193">Referring to FIG. 12, the recessed portion 21 is between the external wall 13s of the drum chamber frame 13 and a partitioning wall 13t located slightly inward of the external wall 13s.</p>
    <p num="194">
      As regards the right-hand side recessed portion 21 of the drum chamber frame 13, which is located on the same lengthwise end of the drum chamber frame 13 as the drum gear 7b, the inward facing surface of the external wall 13e and the outward facing surface of the partitioning wall 12t, that is, the opposing two surfaces of the recessed portion 21, are perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of the drum chamber frame 13, and the arm portion 19 of the image developing chamber frame 12, which is located on the same lengthwise end of the image developing chamber frame 12 as the development roller gear 9k, exactly fits between these opposing two surfaces.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the left-hand side recessed portion 21 of the drum chamber frame 13, which is located on the same lengthwise end of the drum chamber frame 13 as the spur gear 7n, and the arm portion 19 of the image developing chamber frame 12, which is inserted into this left-hand side recessed portion 21, loosely fit in terms of the lengthwise direction of the process cartridge B.
    </p>
    <p num="195">
      Therefore, the image developing chamber frame 12 and the cleaning chamber frame 13 are accurately positioned relative to each other in terms of the lengthwise direction of the process cartridge B. More specifically, this is due to the following reasons.
      <br/>
      It is easy to manufacture a drum chamber frame 13 having a precise distance between the opposing surfaces of the recessed portion 21 located at the lengthwise end of the drum chamber frame 13, and also an image developing chamber frame 12 having an arm portion 19 with an accurate width.
      <br/>
      Further, even when the measurement of the image developing chamber frame 12 and cleaning chamber frame 13 in the lengthwise direction thereof change due to their deformation caused by temperature increase, the distance between the opposing two surfaces of the recessed portion 21, and the width of the arm portion 19 which fits between these opposing two surfaces, scarcely change, due to their small measurements.
      <br/>
      In addition, the recessed portion 21 located on the same side as the spur gear 7n, and the arm portion 19 which is fitted into this recessed portion 21, are provided with a play in the lengthwise direction of the process cartridge B, and therefore, even if the measurements of the image developing chamber frame 12 and cleaning chamber frame 13 in the lengthwise direction of theirs change due to their thermal deformation, no stress occurs between the image developing chamber frame 12 and the cleaning chamber frame 13 due to their thermal deformation.
    </p>
    <p num="196">Magnetic Seal for Longitudinal End of Developing Roller</p>
    <p num="197">
      As described before with reference to FIG. 14, the development roller 9c is provided with magnetic sealing members 71, which are located at both the longitudinal ends, one at each end.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 40, the magnetic sealing member 71 is attached to the development frame 12, being positioned so that a gap g1 is maintained between it and the peripheral surface of the development roller 9c.
      <br/>
      It consists of a magnet 73, and a magnetic plate (magnetic material) 74.
      <br/>
      The magnetic plate 74 is affixed to the magnet 73, on the outward side in terms of the longitudinal direction of the development roller 9c.
    </p>
    <p num="198">Next, the magnetic sealing member 71 in this embodiment will be described in detail.</p>
    <p num="199">
      The magnet 73, that is, a component of the magnetic sealing member 71, is a 3 mm wide member formed by extruding the mixture of magnetic particles of Nd--Fe--B and nylon binder.
      <br/>
      The magnetic plate 74, that is, the other component of the magnetic sealing member 71, is a 1 mm thick steel member.
      <br/>
      The two components are attached to each other by inserting the magnetic plate 74 during the extrusion of the magnet 73.
      <br/>
      However, they may be attached to each other with the use of double sided adhesive tape, or may simply be magnetically attached to each other, since the magnetic sealing member 71 is effective in terms of the function which will be described later, regardless of the aforementioned methods used to keep the two components attached.
      <br/>
      The gap g1 between the development roller 9c and the magnetic sealing member 71 is 0.1-0.7 mm, which makes the magnetic flux density at the peripheral surface of the development roller 9c approximately 1000-2000 gauss.
      <br/>
      As for the positional relationship between the magnet 73 and the magnetic plate 74, the magnet 73 is on the inward side of the magnetic plate 74, that is, on the side of the opening of the development frame 12, the length and position of which correspond to the portion of the development roller 9c covered with dots in FIG. 40; the magnetic plate 74 is on the outward side of the magnet 73, that is, on the side of the longitudinal end of the development roller 9c.
    </p>
    <p num="200">With the positioning of the magnetic sealing member 71 as described above, the magnetic field generated by the magnet 73 is distorted by the magnetic plate 74, which is highly permeable, as illustrated by the magnetic flux lines 75 in FIG. 41, (b) which is an enlarged drawing of the portion designated by a referential character A in FIG. 41. In other words, the force from the magnet 73 is prevented from reaching outward beyond the outward edge of the magnetic sealing member 71 by the magnetic plate 74.</p>
    <p num="201">
      Therefore, as the toner particles spread toward the longitudinal end of the development roller 9c, they enter the magnetic field of the magnet 73 distorted by the magnetic plate 74 as described above, being thereby caused to move in the direction illustrated by the magnetic flux lines 75.
      <br/>
      In other words, they are prevented from moving outward beyond the outward edge of the magnetic plate 74 (edge of opening 12p of development frame 12).
      <br/>
      Thus, it does not occur that the toner particles come in contact with the spacer ring 9i as the development roller 9c rotates.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the spacer ring 9i can be placed close to the outward surface of the magnetic sealing member 71, affording the size reduction of the process cartridge B, which in turn affords the size reduction of the image forming apparatus 14.
      <br/>
      In other words, according to this embodiment, the strongest portion of the magnetic field of the magnet 73, that is, the portion immediately next to the peripheral surface of the magnetic sealing member 71, is used to confine the toner particles in the space on the inward side of the edge of the opening 12p, assuring that the toner particles do not spread outward beyond the edge of the opening 12p.
      <br/>
      That is, the toner particles are desirably sealed; it is assured that they are prevented from leaking even if the process cartridge B is subjected to strong shock or the like by users while it is mounted into, or dismounted from, the main assembly 14 of the image forming apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      Further, positioning the magnetic plate 74 in contact with the magnet 73, on the outward side in terms of the longitudinal direction of the development roller 9c, distorts the magnetic field generated by the magnet 73, that is, changes the direction of the magnetic flux from the magnet 73, in such a way that the magnetic flux converges to the magnetic plate 74, increasing magnetic flux density, that is, magnetic force, at the surface of the magnet 73, as illustrated in FIG. 40, (b), in which the magnetic flux is represented by the lines 75.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the magnetic sealing member 71 becomes more effective as the sealing means, which affords the employment of a magnet with less magnetic force, which is less expensive.
      <br/>
      In other words, positioning the magnetic plate 74 as described above helps cost reduction.
    </p>
    <p num="203">Next, an embodiment in which the magnet 73 and the magnetic plate 74 have been switched in position will be described with reference to FIGS. 42 and 43.</p>
    <p num="204">
      In FIGS. 42 and 43, the same components or portions as those in FIGS. 40 and 41 are given the same referential codes as those given in FIGS. 40 and 41 to omit the repetition of the same descriptions.
      <br/>
      Only the structure of the magnetic sealing member which characterizes this embodiment will be described.
    </p>
    <p num="205">
      Referring to FIG. 42, regarding the positional relationship between the magnet 73 and the magnetic plate 74 which constitute the magnetic sealing member 71, the magnetic plate 74 is placed on the opening 12p side of the magnet 73.
      <br/>
      Further, the magnetic sealing member 71 is positioned so that the magnet 73 is positioned on the slightly outward side of the edge of the opening 12p.
    </p>
    <p num="206">Further, the magnetic sealing member 71 is positioned as close as possible to the opening 12p to reduce the size of the image forming apparatus.</p>
    <p num="207">Also in this embodiment, the magnetic flux does not reach beyond the width of the magnetic sealing member 71.</p>
    <p num="208">Therefore, the toner particles do not spread up to the inward side of the magnetic plate 74, that is, the edge of the opening 12p.</p>
    <p num="209">
      Within the development roller 9c, a magnet 9g is disposed, and the magnetic plate 74 is disposed so that the position of the magnetic plate 74 corresponds to the longitudinal end of the magnet 9g.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a magnetic field is formed by the two magnets 9g and 73 as illustrated by the magnetic flux lines 75 in FIG. 44, which is the schematic cross section of the magnetic sealing member 71 and the magnet 9g, at the plane D--D in FIG. 43. Further, as the plane E--E in FIG. 43, a magnetic field is formed by the magnet 73 as illustrated by the magnetic flux lines 75 in FIG. 45, which is the schematic cross section of the magnet 73 at the plane E--E.
      <br/>
      In other words, at the longitudinal end of the development roller 9c, two magnetic brushes are formed: a magnetic brush formed by the magnet 9g and the magnetic plate 74, and another magnetic brush formed by the magnet of the magnetic sealing member 71.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the effectiveness of the magnetic sealing member 71 as sealing means is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="210">
      Further, positioning the magnetic plate 74 in contact with the magnet 73, on the inward side in terms of the longitudinal direction of the development roller 9c, distorts the magnetic field generated by the magnet 73, that is, changes the direction of the magnetic flux from the magnet 73 in such a way that the magnetic flux converges to the magnetic plate 74, increasing magnetic flux density, that is, magnetic force, at the surface of the magnet 73, as illustrated in FIG. 43, (b), in which the magnetic flux is represented by the lines 75.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the magnet 73 becomes more effective as the sealing member.
    </p>
    <p num="211">
      Further, the improvement in the effectiveness of the magnetic sealing member 71 affords employing a magnet with less magnetic force, which costs less.
      <br/>
      In other words, this embodiment also can allow cost reduction.
    </p>
    <p num="212">Shape of Magnetic Sealing Member and Method for Attaching</p>
    <p num="213">FIGS. 46 and 53 are perspective views of the magnetic sealing member 71, and depict the details thereof.</p>
    <p num="214">
      Roughly speaking, the magnet 73 is constituted of a semicircular portion 73a, which corresponds to the semicircular portion of the magnetic sealing member 71, and a noncircular portion which is constituted of three distinctive portions: a bottom portion 73b, a middle portion 73d, and a top portion 73e.
      <br/>
      The bottom portion 73b is basically rectangular and extends upward from the top end of the semicircular portion 73a.
      <br/>
      The middle portion 73d is a transitional portion where the thickness of the noncircular portion is gradually reduced rearward from the top end of the bottom portion 73b to the bottom end of the top portion 73e.
      <br/>
      The top portion 73e is a portion which horizontally extends outward from the outward surface of the transitional middle portion 73d.
      <br/>
      The magnetic plate 74 is constituted of a semicircular portion 74a, which corresponds to the semicircular portion of the magnetic sealing member 71, and a noncircular portion 74b, which is rectangular and extends upward from the top end of the semicircular portion 74b.
      <br/>
      The top end of the magnetic plate 74 is in contact with the step portion of the bottom noncircular portion 73b of the magnet 73.
      <br/>
      At the offset portion of the bottom noncircular portion 73b of the magnet 73, the surface of the noncircular portion 74b of the magnetic plate 74 is flush with the surface of the bottom noncircular portion 73b of the magnet 73, on both the front and lateral sides of the magnetic sealing member 71.
      <br/>
      The cross section of the magnet 73 is rectangular, and so is the combined cross section of the magnet 73 and magnetic plate 74.
      <br/>
      The semicylindrical inward surfaces (portions on front side in drawings) of both the semicircular portions 73a and 74a face the peripheral surface of the development roller 9c, with the presence of the gap g1 between the two.
    </p>
    <p num="215">
      The peripheral surfaces (back sides) of the magnet 73 and the magnetic plate 74 are backed by an elastic lining 77, as a sealing member, formed of elastic material such as rubber.
      <br/>
      The elastic lining 77 is substantially as wide as the combined thickness of the magnet 73 and magnetic plate 74 in terms of the longitudinal direction of the development roller 9c, and its bottom end surface 77f is rendered flush with the bottom end surfaces 73f and 74f of the magnet 73 and the magnetic plate 74, respectively.
      <br/>
      The top end surface 77g of the elastic lining 77 is rendered substantially flush with the top end surface of the magnet 73.
    </p>
    <p num="216">
      The lining 77 is pasted to the back sides of the magnet 73 and magnetic plate 74 with the use of double sided adhesive tape, or through vulcanization.
      <br/>
      The lining 77 prevents the toner particles from leaking out through the gap between the magnetic sealing member 71 and the development frame 12.
    </p>
    <p num="217">
      Referring to FIG. 47, the development frame 12 is provided with grooves 72 into which the magnetic sealing member 71 is fitted.
      <br/>
      The groove 72 extends from the top edge of the flat surface 12i to the bottom edge of the semicylindrical surface 12j, straight down and following the curvature of the semicylindrical surface 12j.
      <br/>
      In other words, the groove 72 is constituted of three continuous portions: the curved portion 72a which follows the contour of the semicylindrical surface 72a, the straight portion 72b which vertically extends following the flat surface 12i, and the positioning portion 72d which extends outward from the top end portion of the straight portion 72b, and in which the horizontal top portion 73e of the magnetic sealing member 71 fits.
      <br/>
      The mid portion of the curved portion 72a is open to the opening 12p.
      <br/>
      The depth of the positioning portion 72d, i.e., the top end portion, equals the width W1 of the horizontal top portion 73e of the magnet 73.
      <br/>
      The depth of the vertical straight portion 72b is less than the total of the width W1 of the horizontal top portion 73e and the thickness W2 of the lining 77, by the amount by which the lining 77 will be compressed.
      <br/>
      Into this vertical straight portion 72b fits the vertical straight bottom portion 73b of the magnet 73.
      <br/>
      The top and bottom end surfaces 72g and 72f, respectively, of the curved portion 72a are so positioned, and angled, that they become flush with the top and bottom end surfaces 71g and 71f, respectively, of the magnetic sealing member 71, as the magnetic sealing member 71 is fitted into the groove 72.
    </p>
    <p num="218">
      In fitting the magnetic sealing member 71 into the grove 72, the magnetic sealing member 71 is positioned as illustrated in FIG. 48, and then is inserted into the groove 72 in the direction indicated by an arrow mark in the same drawing, so that the semicircular portion 71a of the magnetic sealing member 71 fits into the curved portion 72a of the groove 72 as illustrated in FIG. 49. Then, the noncircular portion 71b of the magnetic sealing member 71 is fitted into the vertical straight portion 72b of the grove 72.
      <br/>
      Next, slight pressure is applied to the magnetic sealing member 71 in the direction indicated by an arrow mark (a) in FIG. 49, whereby the bottom portion 77a of the lining 77 is compressed, and at the same time, the bottom and top end surfaces 71g and 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 become flush with the top and bottom ends 72g and 72f of the groove 72, respectively.
      <br/>
      Next, the magnetic sealing member 71 is pushed rearward in the direction perpendicular to the direction indicated by the arrow mark (a), whereby the magnetic sealing member 71 is correctly fitted in the groove 72 as illustrated in FIG. 50. In this state, the bottom noncircular portion 73b of the magnetic sealing member 71, and the noncircular portion 74b of the magnetic plate 74, project above the flat surface 12i of the development frame 12 by a distance of e (value of e becomes gradually smaller toward the bottom).
    </p>
    <p num="219">
      In this state, the top and bottom end surfaces 71g and 71g of the magnetic sealing member 71 are being pressed upon the top and bottom ends 72g and 72f of the groove 72 by the elasticity of the lining 77.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the magnetic sealing member 71 remains in the groove 71.
    </p>
    <p num="220">
      The above described assembly step for inserting the magnetic sealing member 71 into the groove 72 by pressing down the magnetic sealing member 71 may be carried out independently from the other assembly processes, or may be replaced by the simple modification of the step for mounting the development blade 9d.
      <br/>
      This simple modification will be described next.
    </p>
    <p num="221">
      Referring to FIG. 49, the development blade assembly 9d is placed in contact with the front surface of the magnetic sealing member 71 by being moved rightward in the drawing.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the rubber blade 9d2 of the development blade assembly 9d is placed in contact with the bottom noncircular portion 71b.
      <br/>
      Then, the development blade assembly 9d is pulled downward while being pressed upon the magnetic sealing member 71.
      <br/>
      As a result, the metallic plate 9d1 comes in contact with the front corner of the top end surface 73g and the front surface 73h of the transitional noncircular portion 73d of the magnet 73, and the rubber blade portion 9d2 comes in contact with the bottom noncircular portions 73b of the magnet 73 and the noncircular portion 74b of the magnetic plate 74.
      <br/>
      Then, the development blade assembly 9d is pulled down farther while being pressed upon the magnetic sealing member 71, whereby the magnetic sealing member 71 is pulled down by the friction between the development blade assembly 9d and the magnetic sealing member 71.
      <br/>
      As a result, the bottom portion 77a of the lining 77 is compressed, allowing the top and bottom end surfaces 71g and 71f to become flush with the top and bottom end surfaces of the groove 72, respectively.
      <br/>
      Further, since the development blade assembly 9d is being pressed upon the magnetic sealing member 71, the top portion of the magnetic sealing member 71 is fitted into the top portion of the groove 72.
      <br/>
      Next, while holding the development blade assembly 9d where it is, the development blade assembly 9d is attached to the development frame 12 as described previously, concluding the modified step for attaching the development blade assembly 9d.
      <br/>
      As is evident from the above description, modifying the step for attaching the development blade assembly 9d to the development frame 12 makes unnecessary the independent step for fitting the top portion of the magnetic sealing member 71 into the top portion of the groove 72, as illustrated in FIG. 50.
    </p>
    <p num="222">
      Next, the step for attaching the development blade assembly 9d to the development frame 12 will be described.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 14, first, the metallic plate 9d1 is placed in contact with the development frame 12, with the dowels 12i1 of the development frame 12 fitted in the holes 9d3 and 9d5 of the metallic plate 9d1.
      <br/>
      Next, the toner scraping member 42 is laid on top of the metallic plate 9d1, with the dowels 12i1 and 12i3 of the development frame 12 fitted in the holes 42b and 42c of the toner scraping member 42.
      <br/>
      Then, a small screw 9d6 is put through the screw hole 42d of the member 42, and the screw hole 9d4 of the metallic plate 9d1, and is screwed into the screw hole 12i2 of the wall 12i of the development frame 12, at both the longitudinal ends of the process cartridge.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 51, as the metallic plate 9d1 is moved toward the wall 12i of the development frame 12 by the turning of the small screw 9d6, to be tightly placed in contact with the wall 12i, the metallic plate 9d1 presses the front surface 73h of the magnet 73, whereby the noncircular portions of the magnetic sealing member 71 are pushed into the groove 72.
    </p>
    <p num="223">
      More specifically, as the top noncircular portion of the magnetic sealing member 71 is pressed as described above, the magnetic sealing member 71 rotates about the bottom edge of its bottom end surface 71f, and the top portion of the magnetic sealing member 71 moves into the groove 71 of the development frame 12.
      <br/>
      As a result, the lining 77 is compressed inward of the groove 72.
      <br/>
      As the lining 77 is compressed, the reactive force from the lining 77 is borne by the metallic plate 9d1 with which the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72 of the development frame 12, and the front surface 73h of the magnet 73, are in contact.
    </p>
    <p num="224">Next, the development roller unit G is attached as described previously, and depicted in FIG. 52. Attaching the development roller unit G causes the urethane rubber, or silicon rubber, blade portion 9d2 of the cleaning blade 9d to bend, increasing the pressure which the metallic plate 9d1 applies to the development frame 12, and therefore assuring further that the magnetic sealing member 71 remains properly attached.</p>
    <p num="225">
      With the provision of the above described structure, it is assured that the magnetic sealing member 71 remains in the groove 72 by being simply fitted in the groove 71, and also, it is accurately attached by being simply pressed on the top portion by the metallic plate 9d1.
      <br/>
      The dimension of the horizontal top noncircular portion 73e of the magnet 73 in terms of the depth direction of the groove 73 equals the depth of the portion 72d of the groove 72 into which the portion 73e fits.
      <br/>
      The length 73L of the horizontal top noncircular portion 73e from its base to the tip equals the length 72L of the portion 72d of the groove 72 in terms of the longitudinal direction of the development roller 9c.
      <br/>
      The magnetic sealing member 71 is confined by the metallic plate 9d1 so that the horizontal top noncircular portion 73e of the magnetic sealing member 71 perfectly fits in the portion 72d of the groove 72.
      <br/>
      Thus, the magnetic sealing member 71 is accurately positioned relative to the development roller 9c in terms of the direction perpendicular to the axial direction of the development roller 9c.
    </p>
    <p num="226">Sealing of Bottom End of Magnetic Sealing Member</p>
    <p num="227">
      Referring to FIG. 46, according to the above described sealing method which employs a magnetic sealing member, the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 is substantially level with the front surface of the bottom noncircular portion 73b of the magnet 73.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 47, the cross section of the bottom end 73f of the groove 72 and the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 are rectangular, being the same in shape and size.
      <br/>
      With the magnetic sealing member 71 properly fitted into the groove 72, the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 is flush with both edges of the bottom end surface 72f of the the groove 72.
      <br/>
      Thus, the magnetic sealing member 71 is accurately positioned, whereby the interface between the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71, and the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72, is tightly sealed, preventing the toner particles from shifting from the center portion of the development roller 9c toward the longitudinal end of the development roller 9c, and passing between the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72 and the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71.
    </p>
    <p num="228">Next, the structure for tightly sealing the interface between the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 and the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72 will be described.</p>
    <p num="229">
      The magnetic sealing member 71 in this embodiment is the same as the one in the preceding embodiment, except for the bottom ends of the groove 72 and the lining 77.
      <br/>
      Therefore, only the bottom portions of the magnetic sealing member 71 and the groove 72 different from those in the embodiment will be described.
    </p>
    <p num="230">
      Referring to FIG. 56, the bottom end 77f of the lining 77 is provided with a sealing portion 77f1, and a sealing member 79 for covering the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71.
      <br/>
      This sealing member 79 is integrally formed with the lining 77, as a part of the lining 77, or in some cases, it is formed independently from the lining 77.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 55 to 57 pertain to the lining 77, and the sealing member 79 integrally formed with the lining 77.
      <br/>
      The lining 77 is configured so that the sealing portion 77f1 becomes flush with, or slightly recessed from, the bottom end surface 71f, and is placed on the positioning side.
    </p>
    <p num="231">
      Even if the sealing member 79 is formed independently from the lining 77, as long as it is solidly attached to the lining 77 in advance, substantially the same assembly method as that for the integrally formed sealing member 79 may be employed.
      <br/>
      When the main portion of the elastic lining 77 is used only to seal the back side of the magnetic sealing member 71, and the sealing member 79 at the bottom end of the lining 77 is used to tightly seal the bottom end of the magnetic sealing member 71, they are assembled in the manner which will be described later.
    </p>
    <p num="232">
      Referring to FIG. 56, the sealing member 79 is in the shape of a tent with a ridge 79a parallel to the development roller 9c, and projects beyond the sealing portion 77f1.
      <br/>
      The figurative bottom surface 79b of the sealing member 79 is a flat surface which contacts the bottom end surface 71f.
      <br/>
      Before the application of pressure, that is, before the sealing member 79 is compressed in the direction from the ridge 79a to the bottom surface 79b, the edge 79a1 of the bottom surface 79b is slightly below the corner 71a1 at which the semicylindrical inward surface of the semicircular portion 71a ends.
      <br/>
      However, as the sealing member 79 is compressed as described above, the surface 79c of the sealing member 79 becomes virtually flush with the semicylindrical inward surface of the semicircular portion 71a.
    </p>
    <p num="233">
      Referring to FIG. 57, the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72, with which the magnetic sealing member 71, the sealing surface 77f1, the sealing member 79, and the like, make contact, are provided with a surface 72f1 and the sealing surface 72f2.
      <br/>
      The surface 72f1 comes in contact with the bottom end surface 71f, correctly positioning the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71.
      <br/>
      The sealing surface 72f2 is recessed from the surface 72f1, creating a step with a vertical surface 72f3.
    </p>
    <p num="234">Also referring to FIG. 57, the width a of the surface 72f1 is substantially equal to the width a, i.e., the difference between the width of the bottom end surface 71f and the width of the sealing member 79.</p>
    <p num="235">
      The positioning surface 72f1 is constituted of two adjoining surfaces: a surface 72f1, the top portion, with which the bottom end surface 71f comes in contact to be correctly positioned in terms of the vertical direction, and a surface 72f12, the bottom portion, with which the sealing surface 77f1 comes in contact.
      <br/>
      The surface 72f12 adjoins the bottom surface 72a1 of the semicircular portion 72a of the groove 72.
    </p>
    <p num="236">
      The sealing surface 72f2 is constituted of two adjoining surfaces: a vertical sealing surface 72f21, and a slant sealing surface 72f22 which adjoins the bottom surface 72a1.
      <br/>
      In attaching the magnetic sealing member 71, first, the magnetic sealing member 71 is simply fitted into the groove 72.
      <br/>
      In this state, that is, before compressing the lining 77 in the radial direction of the development roller 9c, the ridge 79a of the sealing member 79 is in contact with the vertical sealing surface 72f21, above the borderline between the vertical sealing surface 72f21 and the slant sealing surface 72f22.
      <br/>
      However, as the lining 77 is compressed, the sealing member 79 shifts toward the bottom surface 72a1 of the semicircular portion 72a of the groove 72, and therefore, the ridge 79a of the sealing member 79 shifts toward the borderline 72f23 between the vertical sealing surface 72f21 and the slant sealing surface 72f22.
      <br/>
      It should be noted here that the above description applies only to the case in which the lining 77 integral with the sealing member 79 is fixed to the magnetic sealing member 71 with adhesive or the like; in other words, the case in which the magnetic sealing member 71, integral with the lining 77 and the sealing member 79, is fitted into the groove 72.
      <br/>
      As described previously, after the process described above, the magnetic sealing member 71 is pressed downward, whereby the lining 77 is compressed in its thickness direction, and at the same time, the sealing member 79 and the surface 72f1 are compressed, or pressed, against the sealing surface 72f2 and the surface 72f12, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="237">
      As the sealing member 79 is compressed against the sealing surface 72f2, the downward facing surface 79d of the sealing member 79 is pressed against the sealing surface 72f22, and the upward facing surface 79c is pressed against the sealing surface 72f21.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the sealing member 79 is compressed toward the bottom end surface 71f.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the volume of the space between the bottom end surface 71f and the sealing surface 72f22 reduces, causing the upward facing surface 79c of the sealing member 79 to move upward.
    </p>
    <p num="238">
      This upward movement of the upward facing surface 79c caused by the compression of the sealing member 79 increases the size of the contact surface between the sealing member 79 and the sealing surface 72f21, and also causes the sealing member 79 to reach the top edge portion 72e of the bottom end surface 72f.
      <br/>
      As a result, the problem that the toner particles on the development roller 9c move from the portion correspondent to the opening 12p to the longitudinal end of the development roller 9c, pass between the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71, and the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72 in which the magnetic sealing member 71 is fitted, and leak out of the process cartridge, is eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="239">
      Further, the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72 is provided with a wall 78 integrally formed with the development frame 12.
      <br/>
      The wall 78 borders the aforementioned positioning surface 72f1, on the opening 12p side, and has a surface which comes in contact with the lateral surface 71c of the magnetic sealing member 71, on the opening 12p side.
    </p>
    <p num="240">After the magnetic sealing member 71 is properly fitted in the groove 72, the positioning surface 72f11 and the bottom end surface 71f remain in contact with each other to keep the bottom end of the magnetic sealing member 71 at the correct position.</p>
    <p num="241">
      Further, the sealing member 79 remains compressed in the space between the sealing surface 72f2 and the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71.
      <br/>
      The sealing portion 77f1 remains compressed by the corner sealing surface 72f12 which is in contact with the sealing portion 77f1.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the toner particles on the opening 12p side cannot pass between the bottom end surface 71f and the bottom end surface 72f and cannot move out of the development frame 12.
    </p>
    <p num="242">Further, the wall 78 is in contact with the lateral surface 71c, on the opening 12p side, providing the labyrinth effect, which keeps the interface between the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 and the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72 better sealed; the labyrinth effect prevents the toner particles from passing between the surface 71c of the magnetic sealing member 71 and the surface of the wall 78.</p>
    <p num="243">
      In addition, the lining 77 is compressed toward the bottom surface 72b1 of the semicircular portion 72a of the groove 72, and the bottom surface 72b2 of the noncircular portion 72b of the groove 72 by the magnetic sealing member 71 as the lining 77 in the preceding embodiment is compressed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the toner particles on the opening 12p side are prevented from leaking between the surface of the magnetic sealing member 71, on the rear side, and the bottom surface of the groove 72, and then, moving toward the longitudinal end of the development roller 9c.
    </p>
    <p num="244">
      The above described method for sealing between the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 and the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72 can be employed regardless of the positional relationship between the magnet 73 and the magnetic plate 74.
      <br/>
      In other words, it can be employed for both a case in which the magnetic plate 74 faces the opening 12p, and a case in which it does not.
      <br/>
      Further, obviously, this sealing method works even if the positions of the positioning surface 72f1 and the sealing surface 72f2 of the groove 72 are reversed in terms of the longitudinal direction of the development roller 9c.
      <br/>
      Further, instead of providing the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72 with the step in terms of the longitudinal direction of the development roller 9c, the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 may be provided with a step in terms of the longitudinal direction of the development roller 9c, so that one side of the step constitutes the positioning surface and the other constitutes the sealing surface (FIG. 66, (e)).

    <p num="245">Magnetic Sealing Member Bottom End Structure and Method for Attaching Magnetic Sealing Member</p>
    <p num="246">
      Next, a method for attaching the magnetic sealing member 71, the elastic lining 77, and the end sealing member 79, to the development frame 12 will be described.
      <br/>
      The above described method for attaching the magnetic sealing member 71, which lacks the bottom end sealing member, can also be used for a magnetic sealing member which comprises the bottom end sealing member 79.
    </p>
    <p num="247">
      Hereinafter, a method for attaching a magnetic sealing member 79, which is different from the preceding magnetic sealing member in that it comprises a bottom end sealing member 79, will be described.
      <br/>
      This method varies depending on whether the bottom end sealing member 79 is integral with the elastic lining 77 or not, and whether the elastic lining 77 and the bottom end sealing member 79 are attached in advance to the magnetic sealing member 71 or the development frame 12.
    </p>
    <p num="248">
      Referring to FIG. 58, according to the sealing method illustrated in this drawing, first, the lining 77 and the sealing member 79, which have been integrally formed, are fixed to the magnetic sealing member 71 with the use of double sided adhesive tape, adhesive, vulcanization, or the like.
      <br/>
      Then, this magnetic sealing member 71, to which the lining 77 with the sealing member 79 has been fixed, is fitted into the groove 72 in the same direction indicated by an arrow mark in the drawing, as was the aforementioned magnetic sealing member in the preceding embodiment, to which the lining without the sealing member has been fixed.
      <br/>
      It should be noted here that, as described previously, even in a case in which the lining 77 and the sealing member 79 are separately produced, and are integrated with each other before they are fixed to the magnetic sealing member 71, the magnetic sealing member 71 can be fitted into the groove 72 using the method in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      As the sealing member 71 is fitted into the groove 72, the sealing member 79 is pressed against the sealing surface 72f2 of the groove 72, and the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 is placed in contact with the positioning surface 72f1.

      As described previously, the sealing member 79 is in the form of a tent with a ridge 79a.
      <br/>
      Thus, as the sealing member 79 in contact with the sealing surface 72f2 is pressed toward the sealing surface 72f2, the ridge 79a shifts upward following the vertical portion 72f21 of the sealing surface 72f2.
      <br/>
      The upward facing surface 76c of the sealing member 79 approaches the theoretical extension of the semicylindrical inward surface of the semicircular portion 71a of the magnetic sealing member 71, which will maintain a predetermined gap from the development roller 9c.
      <br/>
      As a result, the sealing member 79 comes in contact with the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72, across the major portion of the sealing surface 72f21 and the entire portion of the sealing surface 72f22.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the sealing performance of the magnetic sealing member 71, at the interface between the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 and the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72, is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="250">
      In other words, the toner particles on the opening side 12p are prevented from moving outward by (1): close contact between the wall 78 and the lateral surface of the magnetic sealing member 71, (2): close contact between the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 and the positioning surface 72f11 of the groove 72, (3): direct pressing upon the portion 72f22 of the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72 by the bottom surface portion 77f of the lining 77, and (4): direct pressing upon the sealing surface 72f2 by the sealing member 79.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a high degree of sealing performance is realized.
    </p>
    <p num="251">
      FIG. 59 illustrates another method for fitting the magnetic sealing member 71 into the groove 72, according to which the magnetic sealing member 71 is fitted into the groove 77 after the lining 77, and the sealing member 79 which is independent from the lining 77, are individually glued or welded, to the magnetic sealing member 71.
      <br/>
      This method is the same as the method illustrated in FIG. 58, except that the lining 77 and the sealing member 79 are separately formed.
      <br/>
      In other words, the sealing member 79 is caused to directly press upon the portion 72f2 of the sealing surface 72f of the groove 72, and the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 is caused to directly press upon the positioning portion 72f1 of the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72.
      <br/>
      In the case of this method, the sealing member 79 may be cubical.
      <br/>
      In fixing the sealing member 79 to the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71, the major portion of the figurative bottom surface of the sealing member 79 is fixed to the bottom end surface 73f of the magnet 73, and the rest, that is, a small portion, is fixed to the bottom end surface 77f of the lining 77.
    </p>
    <p num="252">
      FIGS. 60, 61 and 62 illustrate another method for fitting the magnetic sealing member 71 into the groove 72, according to which the lining 77 is glued, or welded, to the magnetic sealing member 71 in advance, and the sealing member 79 is pasted in advance to the development frame 12, on the portion 72f2 of the sealing surface 72f of the groove 72 of the development frame 12.
      <br/>
      Then, the magnetic sealing member 71 to which the lining 77 has been fixed is fitted into the groove 72.
      <br/>
      This method is the same as the method used for fitting the magnetic sealing member with which the sealing member 79 is not used.
      <br/>
      As for the material for the sealing member 79, a compressible substance such as rubber, foamed rubber, or foamed synthetic resin is used.
    </p>
    <p num="253">
      Referring to FIG. 62, the sealing member 79 may be adhered to the development frame 12, not only by the surface which faces the portion 72f2 of the sealing surface 72f, but also by the portion of the surface 79e which faces the portion 72f3, i.e., the offset portion which connects the portions 72f2 and 72f1, of the sealing surface 72f.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the adhering of the sealing member 79 to the step portion 72f3 is limited to the area adjacent to the sealing surface 72f2; the sealing member 79 is not adhered to the step portion 72f3, adjacent to the edge between the positioning surface 72f1 and the step portion 72f3.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, when the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 is being pressed directly upon the positioning surface 72f1, the sealing member 79 is prevented from squeezing itself between the positioning surface 72f1 and the bottom end surface 71f1 of the magnetic sealing member 71.
    </p>
    <p num="254">
      FIG. 63 illustrates another method for fitting the magnetic sealing member 71 into the groove 72, according to which the lining 77 and the sealing member 79 are integrally formed, and are fitted in advance into the groove 72, and then, the magnetic sealing member 71 is fitted into the groove 72 in the direction indicated by an arrow mark in the drawing.
      <br/>
      In this case, adhesive or double sided adhesive tape is applied in advance to the lining 77, on the rear surface, but not on the surface which comes in contact with the sealing surface 72f22 of the sealing member 79.
      <br/>
      However, adhesive or double sided adhesive tape may instead be applied in advance to the groove 72, on the bottom surface, on the portion which comes in contact with the aforementioned portions.
    </p>
    <p num="255">
      FIG. 64 illustrates a method for fitting the magnetic sealing member 71 into the groove 72 when the lining 77 and the sealing member 79 are separate components.
      <br/>
      In this case, the lining 77 and the sealing member 79 are adhered in advance to each other.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, this method is the same as the one illustrated in FIG. 63.
    </p>
    <p num="256">As for a method for separately attaching the lining 77 and the sealing member 79 to the development frame 12, there are two variations: one in which the lining 77 is first fitted into the groove 72, and then, the sealing member 79 is fitted into the groove 72, and the other in which the sealing member 79 is first fitted into the groove 72, and then, the lining 77 is fitted into the groove 72.</p>
    <p num="257">
      In either case, adhesive or double sided adhesive tape is applied in advance to the lining 77, on the rear surface, and the surface which comes in contact with the sealing surface 72f22 of the sealing member 79.
      <br/>
      However, adhesive or double sided adhesive tape may instead be applied in advance to the groove 72, on the bottom surface, on the portion which comes in contact with the aforementioned portions.
    </p>
    <p num="258">FIG. 65 illustrates another method for fitting the magnetic sealing member 71 into the groove 72, according to which the magnetic sealing member 71 to which the sealing member 79 has been attached, on the bottom end surface 71f, with the use of adhesive or the like, is attached to the development frame 12, in the groove 72 in which the lining 77 has been fitted, on the bottom surface.</p>
    <p num="259">
      The accurate positioning of the bottom end surface 71f, and the tight sealing of the interface between the bottom end surface 71f and the development frame 12, are done by providing the development frame 12 with the positioning surface 72f1 and the sealing surface 72f2.
      <br/>
      However, instead of providing the bottom end surface 72f of the groove 72, the bottom end surface 71f of the magnetic sealing member 71 may be provided with two portions offset from each other at a line perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the development roller 9c (FIG. 66, (a) and (b)).
    </p>
    <p num="260">
      Referring to FIG. 66, (c) and (d), the positioning of the magnetic sealing member 71 may be done at the middle of the bottom end surface 71f, and the sealing member 79 may be placed on both sides of the middle portion.
      <br/>
      Further, the positioning may be done at both ends in terms of the longitudinal direction of the development roller 9c, and the sealing member 79 may be placed between these positioning surfaces.

    <p num="261">Replacement of Development Blade in Recycling of Process Cartridge</p>
    <p num="262">
      This method for replacing the development blade 9d2 attached to the development frame 12 relates to such a process cartridge that has the following features.
      <br/>
      That is, the development frame 12 of the process cartridge is provided with a pair of the magnetic sealing member attachment grooves 72, and a pair of the flat metallic plate attachment surface 12i.
      <br/>
      The pair of the magnetic sealing member attachment grooves 72 are perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the development roller attachment portion, and are located one for one at the longitudinal ends of the development roller attachment portion.
      <br/>
      The pair of the flat metallic plate attachment surfaces 12i are the surfaces to which the metallic plate 9d, that is, the supporting member for supporting the development blade assembly 9d, is attached, and are also located one for one at the longitudinal ends of the development roller attachment portion.
      <br/>
      This development blade exchanging method comprises the following steps.
    </p>
    <p num="263">Step (a): the development roller unit G, which comprises the development roller 9c, is removed from the development roller mount.</p>
    <p num="264">Step (b): the metallic plate 9d1 attached to the flat surface 12i of the metallic plate mount is removed from the metallic plate mount to remove the development blade assembly 9d from the development frame 12.</p>
    <p num="265">Step (c): in order to prevent the magnetic sealing member 71 fitted in the magnetic sealing member fitting groove 72 from coming out of the magnetic sealing member fitting groove 72, the metallic plate 9d1, i.e., the member for supporting a replacement development blade, is attached to the development frame 12 so that the metallic plate 9d1 regulates the position of the magnetic sealing member 71.</p>
    <p num="266">Step (d): after attaching the replacement blade 9d2 to the development frame 12 in the preceding step for attaching the replacement development blade, the development roller 9c is attached to the development roller mount of the development frame 12, bending the rubber blade 9d2 of the development blade assembly 9d.</p>
    <p num="267">
      When replacing the development blade assembly 9d, the rubber blade 9d2 of the development blade assembly 9d may be replaced with a replacement rubber blade formed of the same rubber as the rubber for the old rubber blade 9d2, or may be replaced with a rubber blade formed of rubber different from the old one.
      <br/>
      For example, the old rubber blade 9d2 formed of urethane rubber may be replaced with a rubber blade formed of silicon rubber, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p num="268">
      While the development blade assembly 9d is replaced, the magnetic sealing member 71 is held in the groove 72 by the elasticity of the lining 77.
      <br/>
      In other words, even though the magnetic sealing member 71 is a very small component, it does not fall out of the groove 72 while it is not held by the metallic plate 9d1 of the cleaning blade assembly 9d.
    </p>
    <p num="269">
      In order to replace the magnetic sealing member 71 when the development blade assembly 9d is replaced, all that is necessary is to hold the magnetic sealing member 71, by the lateral surfaces, which are closer to the inward surface of the semicircular portion 71a, and slightly project from the semicylindrical surface 12j of the development frame 12, by a tool, and to pull the magnetic sealing member 71 forward.
      <br/>
      The method for attaching a replacement magnetic sealing member 71 is the same as the method used to attach a magnetic sealing member 71 to a development frame 12 while assembling a brand new process cartridge.
    </p>
    <p num="270">
      In a typical process cartridge, the rubber blade 9d2 of the development blade assembly 9d is the least durable component.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is usual that when replacing the development blade assembly 9d, the development roller 9c and the magnetic sealing member 71 are recycled.
    </p>
    <p num="271">
      However, in terms of recycling, it is better to replace the development frame 12 at the same time as the development blade assembly 9d is replaced.
      <br/>
      This is due to the following reason.
      <br/>
      That is, after toner is filled into the toner frame 11, the opening 11i must be covered with the cover film 51 to seal the toner frame, and this process of covering the opening 11i must be done before the toner delivery member 9b is assembled into the toner frame 11 and the development frame 12 is united with the toner frame 11.
    </p>
    <p num="272">
      When the old development frame 12 is replaced with a new development frame 12, the process cartridge B is assembled in the following order.
      <br/>
      First, the magnetic sealing member 71, the development blade assembly 9d, and the development roller 9c, are assembled into the new development frame 12, and the development frame 12 is united with the toner frame 11.
      <br/>
      Then, the development frame 12 and the toner frame 13 are united with the drum frame 13, into which the photosensitive drum 7, the charge roller 8, and the like, have been assembled.
    </p>
    <p num="273">
      According to the preceding embodiment, the bottom end portion of the magnetic sealing member, and the development frame, are provided with the positioning surface, which accurately positions the magnetic sealing member and the development frame relative to each other.
      <br/>
      Also, the bottom end portion of the magnetic sealing member, and the development frame, are configured to provide a space between them, in which the sealing member is positioned.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the interface between the bottom end surface of the magnetic sealing member and the development frame is tightly sealed, preventing toner particles from traveling outward from the opening side of the development frame, and leaking out.
    </p>
    <p num="274">
      The development frame is provided with the internal wall which makes contact with the lateral surface of the magnetic sealing member, which is connected to the bottom end surface of the magnetic sealing member.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the interface between the bottom end portion of the magnetic sealing member and the development frame is better sealed.
    </p>
    <p num="275">
      The bottom end sealing member can be manufactured as a component separate from, or integral with, the elastic member for sealing the interface between the magnetic sealing member and the development frame.
      <br/>
      When manufactured as a separate component, it may be attached to the magnetic sealing member, or the development frame, before the magnetic sealing member is attached to the development frame.
    </p>
    <p num="276">
      However, employment of the bottom end sealing member integral with the elastic member means that the sealing between the elastic member and the bottom end sealing member is perfect.
      <br/>
      It also simplifies the assembly process.
    </p>
    <p num="277">
      When the elastic member and the bottom end sealing member are manufactured as separate components, they may be made in advance into a single piece by adhering them together, so that the same method as the one used when they are formed as the parts of a single piece can be used during their assembly process.
      <br/>
      Further, when they are separate, not only can they be simplified in shape, but also the material for the former can be different from the material for the latter.
    </p>
    <p num="278">Also when the elastic member and the bottom end sealing member are manufactured as separate components, any one of the following methods may be selected to attach them to the development frame: first, both members are pasted to the magnetic sealing member, and then, the magnetic sealing member is attached to the development frame; first, both members are attached to the development frame, and then, the magnetic sealing member is attached to the development frame; first, one of them is pasted to the magnetic sealing member, the other being attached to the development member, and then, the magnetic sealing member is attached to the development frame.</p>
    <p num="279">In this embodiment, the process cartridge B was described as a process cartridge which forms a monochromatic image, but the present invention is applicable, with desirable effects, to a process cartridge which comprises a plurality of developing means for forming an image composed of a plurality of colors (for example, two toner image, three tone images, full color image, or the like).</p>
    <p num="280">
      The electrophotographic photosensitive member does not need to be limited to the photosensitive drum 7.
      <br/>
      For example, the following types may be included.
      <br/>
      First, as for the photosensitive material, photoconductive material such as amorphous silicon, amorphous selenium, zinc oxide, titanium oxide, organic photoconductor, and the like, may be included.
      <br/>
      As for the configuration of the base member on which photosensitive material is placed, it may be in the form of a drum or belt.
      <br/>
      For example, the drum type photosensitive member comprises a cylinder formed of aluminum alloy or the like, and a photoconductor layer deposited or coated on the cylinder.
    </p>
    <p num="281">As for the image developing method, various known methods may be employed; for example, two-component magnetic brush type developing method, cascade type developing method, touch-down type developing method, cloud type developing method, and the like.</p>
    <p num="282">Also in this embodiment, a so-called contact type charging method was employed, but obviously, charging means with a structure different from the one described in this embodiment may be employed; for example, one of the conventional structures, in which a tungsten wire is surrounded by a metallic shield formed of aluminum or the like, on three sides, and positive or negative ions generated by applying high voltage to the tungsten wire are transferred onto the surface of a photosensitive drum to uniformly charge the surface of the photosensitive drum.</p>
    <p num="283">The charging means may in the form of a blade (charge blade), a pad, a block, a rod, a wire, or the like, in addition to being in the form of a roller.</p>
    <p num="284">As for the method for cleaning the toner remaining on the photosensitive drum, a blade, a fur brush, a magnetic brush, or the like may be employed as a structural member for the cleaning means.</p>
    <p num="285">According to the present invention, the developer is effectively prevented from leaking out, and a mounting operativity of the magnetic seal is improved.</p>
    <p num="286">While the invention has been described with reference to the structures disclosed herein, it is not confined to the details set forth and this application is intended to cover such modifications or changes as may come within the purposes of the improvements or the scope of the following claims.</p>
