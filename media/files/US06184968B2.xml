      Flat-panel displays, a substrate for use in such displays, and methods for making the displays and the substrate are disclosed.
      <br/>
      The substrate is a hybrid composite containing an organic component and an inorganic component.
      <br/>
      The substrate possesses attributes of the organic component, which is typically a plastic, such as light weight and impact resistance, as well as attributes of the inorganic component, typically silica particles, such as high temperature stability.
      <br/>
      A variety of flat-panel displays can be made by depositing appropriate device layers, using standard fabrication procedures, on the hybrid composite substrate.
      <br/>
      The monomer is selected, and the relative concentrations of the organic to the inorganic component in the composite are established, based on the thermal processing requirements for making the type of display for which the substrate is intended.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for improved flat-panel displays, and more particularly to improved substrates for use in such displays.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">Glass is used in a wide range of electronic applications because it possesses a number of desirable properties, including transparency and high thermal stability.</p>
    <p num="4">
      An example of an electronics product utilizing glass is a flat-panel display (FPD).
      <br/>
      FPDs are becoming ubiquitous; they are in homes, in the workplace and most other places, as well.
      <br/>
      And their use is increasing.
      <br/>
      See, for example, a series of articles concerning flat panel displays appearing in the Materials Research Society Bulletin for March 1996; Im et al., "Materials for Flat-Panel Displays," p. 27; Moffatt, "Glass Substrates for Flat Panel Displays," pp. 31-34; Hanna et al., "Materials in Active-Matrix Liquid-Crystal Displays," pp. 35-38; Rack et al., "Materials Used in Electroluminescent Displays," pp. 49-58; and Weber et al., "Materials and Manufacturing Issues for Color Plasma Displays," pp. 65-68. These articles are incorporated by reference herein.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      One example of a FPD is an active-matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD).
      <br/>
      Such displays are expected to soon become the dominant technology for high resolution, dense information-content visual communication systems.
      <br/>
      Lightweight, rugged, impact-resistant, high resolution AMLCDs for portable systems such as pagers, phones, personal digital assistants and the like are desired.
      <br/>
      Minimizing the weight of such displays will relax power dissipation requirements since the weight credit can be applied to additional battery capacity.
      <br/>
      Ruggedness and impact resistance are especially desirable in portable products due to handling considerations.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Glass, which is presently used for most FPD applications, is a relatively high weight, low impact resistance and high cost material.
      <br/>
      It would be desirable, therefore, to find a low cost, rugged and light weight alternative to glass for use in AMLCDs and other FPDs.
      <br/>
      Conventional plastics possess the aforementioned properties and can be used to replace glass in a few FPD applications, e.g., passive LCDs.
      <br/>
      Conventional plastics are not, however, suitable for use as the plates, i.e., substrates, in AMLCDs and certain other FPDs.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In AMLCDs, each pixel has its own switching element for regulating charges in the liquid crystal cell.
      <br/>
      Thin-film transistors (TFTs) are typically used as the switching element.
      <br/>
      The TFT, which is fabricated on the substrate, i.e., typically glass in prior art AMLCDs, consists of a gate electrode, a gate dielectric and a semiconductor layer with two electrodes for a source and a drain.
      <br/>
      The primary route to thin film transistor (TFT) based AMLCD technology is amorphous-silicon ( ALPHA -Si).
      <br/>
      Properties of the gate dielectric and  ALPHA -Si are degraded if such materials are deposited much below 250 (degree)  C. Other FPD applications, such as electroluminescent (EL) displays and plasma display panels (PDPs) require even higher temperature processing steps.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Conventional plastics can typically withstand processing temperatures of up to only about 150 (degree)  C. High temperature plastics are available, but these plastics are typically not suitably transparent for display applications.
      <br/>
      Such high temperature plastics are also typically birefringent.
      <br/>
      Birefringent materials have different refractive indices (optical density) in different co-ordinate directions.
      <br/>
      Images presented on a display formed from a birefringent material may appear to be somewhat skewed or otherwise imperfect when observed from various viewing perspectives.
      <br/>
      Thus, displays should preferably exhibit no more than a minimal amount of birefringence.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, due to the high coefficients of thermal expansion, the dimensional stability of most plastics with repeated temperature cycling is such that it would be difficult to achieve suitable registration and overlay accuracy for TFTs with multiple mask levels as used in AMLCDs.
      <br/>
      Thus, while conventional plastics can be used as the substrate for some FPD applications utilizing lower processing temperatures, e.g., passive LCDs, they can not be used for FPDs requiring high temperature processing.
    </p>
    <p num="9">It would be desirable, therefore, to replace the glass substrates used in such FPDs with a substrate that is transparent, not birefringent, possesses the low weight, robustness and low cost of plastics and has a high temperature stability not normally associated with such plastics.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      Improved flat-panel displays, substrates therefor, and methods for forming same are disclosed.
      <br/>
      The compositions and methods of the present invention are based on hybrid inorganic-organic composites (IOCs) having application-specific properties.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In the hybrid IOCs, an organic polymer, i.e., plastic, is coupled with some fraction of an inorganic component to impart some of the inorganic's characteristic properties to the polymer.
      <br/>
      A substrate formed in this manner retains the desirable characteristics typically associated with plastic such as low weight and impact resistance, yet benefits from the additional characteristics imparted from the inorganic component, such as, for example, improved thermal properties.
      <br/>
      The hybrid IOCs can be tailored to possess specific properties as required for a particular application via manipulation of various parameters.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      According to one embodiment of the invention, inorganic particles are grown in-situ from a precursor solution, combined with a coupling agent to ensure inorganic-organic compatibility in the solid state and then combined with an organic monomer.
      <br/>
      The hybrid IOC is formed by polymerizing the monomer.
      <br/>
      Such polymerization forms a matrix that surrounds the solvated inorganic particles.
      <br/>
      The hybrid IOC is formed from mixtures containing about 1-70 percent by weight, on a dry basis, of inorganic precursor, typically a metal alkoxide wherein the metal is selected from Si, Ti, Zr, Ge or Sn, about 20 to 98 percent by weight of the organic component, typically an acrylate-, epoxide- or styrene based monomer and about 1-70 percent by weight of the coupling agent.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Improved flat-panel displays are formed using the hybrid IOCs.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of a process according to the present invention, a hybrid IOC useful as a substrate for an AMLCD is formed.
      <br/>
      Silica particles are generated in-situ from sodium metasilicate solution, combined with methacryloxy-propylmethyl dimethoxysilane, a difunctional silane coupling agent, and then combined with a hydroxyethyl methacrylate, a hydroxy-terminated organic monomer.
      <br/>
      The monomer is then polymerized.
      <br/>
      The resulting substrate is transparent, light weight, impact resistant and possesses thermal properties suitable for AMLCD processing.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, improved AMLCDs, EL displays, PDPs and methods therefor are disclosed.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The hybrid IOCs utilized in the present invention contain an inorganic component in a matrix formed from an organic component.
      <br/>
      Such composites possess properties of both the inorganic component and the organic component and may be tailored for specific end use applications.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      A method for making hybrid IOC substrates useful for AMLCDs and other flat-panel display applications according to the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In operation block 10, a solution is provided of a precursor suitable for forming the inorganic component.
      <br/>
      The precursor solution is selected based on the properties to be imparted to the plastic.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the precursor is a metal alkoxide.
      <br/>
      Metal alkoxide can be represented by the formula M(OR)4 :  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      where: R is a polymerizable or non-polymerizable organic group, which can be individually selected, and M is a metal, preferably germanium (Ge), titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr) or tin (Sn) and more preferably silicon (Si).
      <br/>
      Several non-limiting examples of such metal alkoxides include tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS), zirconium (IV) butoxide and zirconium (IV) propoxide.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The metal alkoxide can be purchased from a manufacturer, such as Gelest, Inc., of Tullytown, Pa.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the metal alkoxide can be synthesized according to well known methods.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In further embodiments, modified metal alkoxides can be used as a precursor.
      <br/>
      In one such modified metal alkoxide, one or more of the --OR groups of the metal alkoxide is replaced by an --R group.
      <br/>
      Methyltriethoxysilane (MTEOS) is an example of such a modified alkoxide.
      <br/>
      See Brinker et al., Sol-Gel Science: The Physics and Chemistry of Sol-Gel Processing, p. 115, (Academic Press, CA 1990).
      <br/>
      This publication, and all other publications mentioned in this specification, are incorporated by reference herein.
      <br/>
      In an additional embodiment, one or more of the --OR groups of the metal alkoxide is replaced with a halogen, preferably chlorine.
      <br/>
      It is within the capabilities of those skilled in the art to select metal alkoxides and modified metal alkoxides suitable for forming inorganic particles.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Exemplary feed compositions for forming the hybrid IOC substrates contain about 1 to about 70 percent by weight, on a dry basis, of the inorganic precursor molecule.</p>
    <p num="21">
      In operation block 20, a metal-oxide based inorganic component is generated in-situ from the precursor solution via controlled nucleation and growth methods.
      <br/>
      Formation of the inorganic component occurs via two steps, which occur simultaneously after initialization.
      <br/>
      The first step is monomer formation via the partial hydrolysis of the metal alkoxide:
      <br/>
      M(OR)n +H2 O --&gt; (RO)n-1 MOH+ROH  �2�
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Solvent and catalyst can be used to promote the reaction.
      <br/>
      The second step is polycondensation of the monomers to form colloid-like oligomers:
      <br/>
      2(RO)n-1 MOH --&gt; (RO)n-1 -0-M (OR)n-2 OH+ROH  �3�
    </p>
    <p num="23">(Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="24">
      Thus, the inorganic component "grows" via a controlled polymerization.
      <br/>
      The terms "inorganic component" and "particle" are used interchangeably in this specification.
      <br/>
      The term "particle" refers to regions of relatively uniform density that are rich in the inorganic component.
      <br/>
      The polymerization can be controlled to yield particles having a specific molecular weight, i.e., size.
      <br/>
      The particles forming the colloid are nanometer (nm)-sized, i.e., less than a micron in diameter, and are preferably less than 400 nm in diameter.
      <br/>
      The formation of such nanometer-sized in-situ-generated inorganic particles is well known in the art.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Yoshida, A., "Silica Nucleation, Polymerization and Growth Preparation of Mono-Disperse Sols," in The Colloidal Chemistry of Silica, Bergna H. E., ed., Adv. Chem. Ser. 234, ACS, Wash. D.C. (1990); Gelest Catalog for Silicon, Germanium, Tin and Lead Compounds, Metal Alkoxides, Diketonates and Carboxylates, pp. 279-283 (1995).
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that the chemistry described above applies well known sol-gel techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      While dry inorganic particles could be conventionally blended into the polymeric host, it is preferable to generate them in-situ as per step 20.
      <br/>
      The reason for this is that during conventional blending, i.e., melt blending, particle agglomeration typically results.
      <br/>
      Such agglomeration may lead to light scattering and poor mechanical properties if the size-scale heterogeneity is sufficiently high.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if a suspension of nanometer-sized inorganic particles can be obtained, such a suspension can be used rather than generating the particles in-situ in step 20.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Most multi-component systems suffer failure at the point of component interface.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is desirable to increase inter-component adhesion in some manner.
      <br/>
      One way to do this is by the addition of a coupling agent, as indicated in operation block 30.
      <br/>
      The coupling agent assists in establishing an "interphase region.". Such an architecture should enhance the mechanical properties of the hybrid IOC by facilitating inter-component stress transfer.
      <br/>
      Agglomeration and phase separation of the inorganic phase, which may lead to light scattering and birefringence, also should be minimized by using a coupling agent.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it has been observed that the coupling agent can result in enhanced thermal resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      It is believed that the coupling agent chemically reacts with both the organic and inorganic components.
      <br/>
      As such, the coupling agent should have both inorganic and organic functional groups that behave chemically similar to the functional groups present in the organic component and the inorganic component.
      <br/>
      The choice of a coupling agent thus depends on the inorganic and organic components used.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      For example, if the organic component is a methacrylate monomer and the inorganic component is tetramethyl orthosilicate or tetraethyl orthosilicate, a suitable coupling agent will contain a vinyl group to react with the vinyl group in the acrylate monomer and a Si--O--R group to react with the silanol groups, e.g., Si--O--H, that result from hydrolysis of the tetramethyl or tetraethyl orthosilicate.
      <br/>
      R can be any polymerizable or non-polymerizable organic compound, such as, without limitation, a methyl or an ethyl group.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the coupling agent has at least two M--O--R groups, i.e., two Si--O--R groups for the above example.
      <br/>
      Given the above organic and inorganic components, suitable coupling agents include, without limitation, methacryloxymethyltriethoxysilane (C11 H22 O5 Si), methacryloxymethyltrimethoxysilane (C8 H16 O5 Si), methacryloxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane (C12 H24 O4 Si), methacryloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane (C10 H20 O4 Si), methacryloxypropyltriethoxysilane (C13 H26 O5 Si), methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (C10 H20 O5 Si) and the like.
      <br/>
      If an epoxide monomer is used, then the coupling agent should include an epoxy group.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the R group of the inorganic functional group of the coupling agent will affect the rate and extent of the reaction between the coupling agent and the inorganic component.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it should be understood that if the inorganic compound contains a metal other than Si, then the coupling agent should contain the other metal instead of silicon.
      <br/>
      Coupling agents can be obtained from manufacturers such as Gelest, Inc. of Tullytown, Pa.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Gelest Catalog for Silicon, Germanium, Tin and Lead Compounds, Metal Alkoxides, Diketonates and Carboxylates, pp. 41-52 (1995).
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The coupling agent can oligomerize and conditions are selected to minimize coupling agent oligomerization.
      <br/>
      Such conditions are known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      See Keefer, K. D., in Silicon-Based Polymer Science, ACS Symp.
      <br/>
      Ser., v. 224 (1990).
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Preferably, the coupling agent should be added to the inorganic component in an amount sufficient to bond to all surface M--O--H groups of the inorganic particles (theoretical requirement).
      <br/>
      Preferably, an excess of two to three times the theoretical requirement should be added.
      <br/>
      Excess coupling agent is discarded.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that the theoretical coupling agent requirement may vary with the inorganic selected and the amount of the inorganic used.
      <br/>
      While the theoretical coupling agent requirement can be estimated from an approximation of the surface M--O--H groups based on average particle size, coupling agent requirements are best determined by routine experimentation.
      <br/>
      A figure of about 0.3 has been found to be satisfactory for the molar ratio of (the coupling agent):(the metal in the organic precursor) for the system described in the Example later in this specification.
      <br/>
      It is expected, however, that lesser amounts of coupling agent may suitably be used.

      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the aforementioned coupling agents are metal alkoxides having a polymerizable --R group.

      <br/>
      Hence, in a further embodiment of the present invention, the inorganic component is generated from a coupling agent.
      <br/>
      Again, the organic functional group of the coupling agent is selected based on the monomer.
      <br/>
      In such cases, the coupling agent serves as the inorganic precursor, so that the coupling agent may comprise up to about 70 percent by weight of feed for forming the hybrid IOC.
      <br/>
      In such a case, it is not necessary to include additional coupling agent to graft the inorganic component to the organic component since the organic functional group is already present in the inorganic component.

      In step 40, the polymer, i.e., plastic host matrix, is formed and the resulting composite is formed into the desired size and shape for an FPD substrate.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, a suitable monomer is added.
      <br/>
      When selecting a monomer for forming a hybrid IOC for use in FPDs, such a monomer should produce a plastic that is non-crystalline so that it is suitably transparent for a display and not birefringent.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art are familiar with the required optical properties.

      Furthermore, the monomer should produce a plastic having a high glass transition temperature, i.e., over 100 (degree)  C. Those skilled in the art will be able to obtain the glass transition temperature for such polymers from reference materials.

      Generally, it is desirable to add a minimum amount of the inorganic component that is required to impart the desired property.
      <br/>
      As increasing amounts of the inorganic component are added, the mass per unit volume of the hybrid IOC increases.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is preferable to select a monomer that is known to produce a plastic possessing a greater measure of the desired property than one producing a plastic possessing a lesser measure of the property.

      Without limitation, acrylate, epoxide and styrene monomer are suitable for forming the hybrid IOC substrates of the present invention.
      <br/>
      It is within the capabilities of those skilled in the art to select other monomers suitable for the present purpose.
      <br/>
      Once a monomer is selected, a parametric study is preferably undertaken wherein various hybrid IOCs are formed using the selected monomer and various levels of a selected inorganic component.
      <br/>
      The thermogravimetric properties and the coefficient of thermal expansion for the various samples are measured.

      A hybrid IOC suitable for forming a AMLCD was formed from silica as the inorganic component and hydroxyethyl methacrylate as the organic component as follows.

      Rather than starting with a metal alkoxide, e.g., TEOS or the like, the inorganic component was generated from sodium metasilicate, an inexpensive, commercially available precursor, commonly known as "water-glass".

      The inorganic component was formed as follows. 17 grams of sodium metasilicate was dissolved at ambient temperature (about 25 (degree)  C.) in 0.1 liters of de-ionized water.

      A solution of 3.0M HCl was prepared and 0.1 liters of such solution was transferred to a 500 cm3 3-neck flask and permitted to equilibrate at 0 (degree)  C. in an ice-bath.

      Purified nitrogen was bubbled through the HCl solution for approximately 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      The sodium metasilicate solution was then added dropwise to the HCl solution with continuous mixing.
      <br/>
      After complete addition of the sodium metasilicate solution, the resulting solution was left to stir for three hours.
      <br/>
      The flask was then removed from the ice-bath, 60.0 g. of NaCl, 0.02 liters of NaOH and 0.160 liters of tetrahydrofuran (THF) were added and the system was stirred vigorously for one hour.
      <br/>
      The resulting suspension was filtered, the filtrate collected and transferred to a 0.5 liter separatory funnel.

      <br/>
      Electroluminescence is a phenomenon that converts electrical energy to luminous energy without generating heat.
      <br/>
      Thin-film electroluminescent (TFEL) displays are characterized by a wide viewing angle, high contrast, wide operating temperature range, ruggedness and long life.

      A simplified schematic of an alternating-current driven TFEL (ACTFEL) display according to the present invention is shown in cross section in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The ACTFEL display is configured as a metal-insulator-semiconductor-insulator-metal (MISIM) thin film.
      <br/>
      A method according to the present invention for forming an ACTFEL display is illustrated in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      Note that substrate pretreatment steps, i.e., cleaning and the like, are not shown but they are part of the manufacturing process.
      <br/>
      The specific functions and materials properties of the various layers shown in FIG. 8 are known to those skilled in the art and will not be described in detail.

      An ACTFEL display according to the present invention comprises a hybrid IOC substrate 302.
      <br/>
      The substrate must be able to withstand processing temperatures of about 550 (degree)  C. Suitable substrates include acrylate-, epoxide and styrene-based monomers having aromatic sidechains and relatively high amounts of the inorganic component, e.g., greater than about 50 percent.
      <br/>
      The substrate is formed according to the methods described above as indicated in step 330 in operation block 300A.
      <br/>
      Device layers are formed in operation block 300B.
      <br/>
      The steps in operation block 300B are descriptive of the processing, for an ACTFEL, that is referenced generically in operation block 70 of FIG. 5b.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      A layer of transparent electrode material 304 is deposited on the substrate 302, as indicated in step 340.
      <br/>
      Typically ITO is used for the layer 304.
      <br/>
      A transparent bottom insulator 306 is then deposited on the transparent electrode material 304, as indicated in step 350.
      <br/>
      Preferred materials for the bottom insulator are those having a high dielectric constant and a high electric field strength, but not subject to "propagating breakdown," which results in catastrophic failure of the EL device.
      <br/>
      In practice, high dielectric-constant insulators often exhibit propagating breakdown.
      <br/>
      As a result, lower dielectric-constant insulators that exhibit "self-healing breakdown" wherein failures are localized are more practical for use in such devices.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Semiconducting phosphor material 308 is deposited on the bottom insulator 306, as indicated in step 360.
      <br/>
      The phosphor material includes two constituents, a host material and a luminescent center.
      <br/>
      The host material dominates the electrical aspects of the phosphor layer and the luminescent center controls the optical emission properties of the phosphor layer.
      <br/>
      Typical host materials are metal sulfides in which the metal is zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca) or strontium (Sr).
      <br/>
      The luminescent center is obtained by doping the host with manganese (Mn+2), terbium (Tb), samarium (Sm), Europium (Eu), Thulium (Tm) and cerium (Ce).
      <br/>
      Different host-luminescent center combinations result in different color emissions.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      A transparent top insulator 310 is deposited on the phosphor constituents 308, as indicated in step 370.
      <br/>
      Finally, a top layer 312 that functions as an electrode and optical reflector is deposited on the top insulator 310, as indicated in step 380.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      In additional embodiments of the present invention, a plasma display and methods therefor are disclosed.
      <br/>
      Color plasma displays generate light by exciting a phosphor layer that emits visible light.
      <br/>
      Three different phosphors are used to generate the three primary colors.
      <br/>
      The phosphors are excited by ultraviolet light that is generated via a gas discharge within the plasma display panel (PDP).
      <br/>
      PDPs are particularly suitable for large-area displays.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      A simplified schematic of a PDP according to the present invention is shown in cross section in FIG. 10. A process according to the invention for making the PDP of FIG. 10 is illustrated in FIG. 11. Like AMLCDs according to the present invention, PDPs are formed in four operations as described below.
      <br/>
      Substrate pretreatment steps, which are part of the manufacturing process, are not shown in the FIG. 11 flow diagram.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      PDPs according to the present invention comprise two hybrid IOC substrates, 401 and 411.
      <br/>
      The substrates 401 and 411 are formed as indicated in operation block 400A of FIG. 11 and as described above.
      <br/>
      The substrates must be able to withstanding processing temperatures as high as 450-600 (degree)  C. Suitable substrates include acrylate-, epoxide and styrene-based monomers having aromatic sidechains and relatively high amounts of the inorganic component, e.g., greater than about 50 percent.
      <br/>
      The substrates are then cleaned.
      <br/>
      The front substrate 401 is processed as indicated in operation block 400B.
      <br/>
      In step 425, thin-film electrodes 403 and 405 are formed using well-known photo lithographic techniques.
      <br/>
      Electrodes 403 are sustain electrodes and electrodes 405 are bus electrodes.
      <br/>
      As indicated in step 430, the electrodes 403 and 405 are covered with a thin layer of dielectric material 407 that acts like a capacitor.
      <br/>
      A thin layer of magnesium oxide (MgO) 409 is deposited on the dielectric material 407.
      <br/>
      The MgO layer 409 increases the life of the display and reduces drive voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The back substrate 411 is processed as indicated in operation block 400C using well known thick-film screen-printing processing.
      <br/>
      Using a multiplicity of printing steps, address electrodes 413 and barrier-ribs 415 are formed as indicated in step 450.
      <br/>
      Phosphors, such as phosphor 417a for generating red light, 417b for generating green light and 417c for generating blue light, are deposited between the barrier-ribs 415.
      <br/>
      The barrier-ribs 415 separate the substrates 401 and 411 and maintain color purity by isolating the different phosphors, e.g., 417a, 417b and 417c.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      As indicated in operation block 400D, the substrates 401 and 411 are joined and hermetically sealed.
      <br/>
      As joined, the electrodes 403, 405 of the front substrate 401 and the electrodes 413 of the back substrate 411 are oriented at right angles with respect to one another.
      <br/>
      For illustrative purposes, these electrodes were pictured in a parallel orientation in FIG. 10. It should be understood that in a PDP, either the front or back substrate and associated layers as pictured in FIG. 10 would be rotated by 90 (degree) . The space between the substrates 401 and 411 is filled with a mixture of neon and xenon gases.
      <br/>
      The steps performed in operation blocks 400B-400D are descriptive, for a PDP, of the processing referenced generically in step 70 of FIG. 5b.
    </p>

      Further details concerning the various elements of the PDP and the requirements for the substrates 401 and 411 are known to those skilled in the art.
