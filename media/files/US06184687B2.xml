    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a plasma process end point determination method and apparatus for determining an end point of a plasma process in a case where an etching process, etc. is performed by producing a plasma within a reaction chamber with use of either RF (radio-frequency) waves or microwaves or both.</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention also relates to a method and apparatus for evaluating the assembly reproducibility of a plasma process apparatus for carrying out an etching process, etc. by producing a plasma within a reaction chamber.</p>
    <p num="3">
      An emission spectroscopy method is widely adopted as one method of automatically determining the end of an etching or cleaning process on an object within a reaction chamber.
      <br/>
      In the emission spectroscopy method, an emission light intensity of a specific wavelength of plasma light, which is produced within the reaction chamber in accordance with the kind of etching gas, etc., is measured.
    </p>
    <p num="4">If a noise component is included in the light intensity of plasma light, it is removed by digital arithmetic operations in order to exactly determine the end point of etching or cleaning.</p>
    <p num="5">
      In an example of the method of determining the end of etching, with the noise component removed by digital arithmetic operations, a light intensity is digitally converted and sampled and a primary differential value of the sampling value is found from a moving average value of the sampling value.
      <br/>
      A secondary differential value of the sampling value is found from a difference in a moving average value of the primary differential value.
      <br/>
      A moving average value of the secondary differential value is compared with a preset value, whereby the end point of etching is determined.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      However, in the method of determining the etching end point by using light intensity of the plasma, if a contamination lies on a plasma light take-in window provided at the reaction chamber, the contamination degrades transmissivity of plasma light and adversely affects the determination of the etching end point.
      <br/>
      In addition, flickering of plasma light due to instability of plasma adversely affects the determination of the etching end point.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Moreover, when an object of a novel material is etched, it is necessary to find a light intensity of plasma, which is enough to detect the etching end point, and a specific wavelength having a variation range.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Since the noise component is removed by finding moving averages twice or more, a time at which a signal variation occurs at the etching end point will delay after arithmetic operations, as compared to the state before the arithmetic operations.
      <br/>
      As a result, it becomes difficult to exactly determine the etching end point.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      One example of the etching apparatus is a magnetron reactive ion etching (RIE) apparatus using a magnetron.
      <br/>
      In the magnetron RIE apparatus, the magnetron is rotated near the reaction chamber while RF power is supplied into the reaction chamber, and a plasma is produced within the reaction chamber to etch an object to be treated.
    </p>
    <p num="10">According to an etching end point determination method for this etching apparatus, a light intensity of plasma within the chamber is monitored through a light pass window, generally formed of quartz glass, and a variation point of the plasma light intensity is determined as an etching end point.</p>
    <p num="11">However, a variation point of plasma light intensity cannot be determined where the light pass window for monitoring plasma light intensity is contaminated or an area for etching is small due to a shift of a plasma caused by rotation of the magnetron, for example, where the area for etching is 10% or less of the entire area of an 8-inch semiconductor wafer, that is, the opening ratio is 10% or less.</p>
    <p num="12">In order to solve the above problems, an etching end point determination method has recently been adopted in which the plasma is regarded as part of a RF circuit and an impedance of the plasma is detected, and a variation point of the impedance is determined as etching end point.</p>
    <p num="13">
      However, in this method, too, the impedance varies at a rotational cycle of the magnetron due to fluctuations of the plasma caused by rotation of the magnetron.
      <br/>
      If the etching area is 10% or less as mentioned above, it is difficult to determine the etching end point because a variation of the etching end point is minute.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      For example, FIG. 1 shows an RF voltage waveform detected by an RF circuit.

      The RF voltage waveform varies in accordance with the rotational cycle of the magnetron, and a minute variation of impedance at the etching end point cannot be recognized owing to noise at the rotational cycle of the magnetron.
      <br/>
      As a result, the etching end point cannot be determined.
    </p>
    <p num="15">As has been described above, the impedance varies at the rotational cycle of the magnetron due to fluctuations of plasma caused by the rotation of the magnetron, and if the process area is small, the process end point cannot be determined because the variation of the end of a plasma process such as an etching process is minute</p>
    <p num="16">
      In the plasma process apparatus, if objects are etched or ashed for a long time, products or products by reaction gas, which are produced by the etching or ashing, are deposited as films on the electrodes, parts constituting the electrodes and the inner wall surface of the reaction chamber.
      <br/>
      In addition, coating material on the electrodes and inner wall of the reaction chamber may be removed, and a uniform plasma process cannot be performed and come off deposit materials become particles.
      <br/>
      In order to solve these problems, the electrodes and reaction chamber are cleaned periodically and the electrodes and parts constituting the electrodes are exchanged periodically.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In order to clean the electrodes and reaction chamber and to exchange the electrodes and parts constituting the electrodes, the electrodes need to be disassembled and reassembled.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the states of the reassembled electrodes, etc. differ from the states before disassembly, a predetermined plasma process performance cannot be attained thereafter.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Under the circumstances, in the prior art, in order to evaluate the plasma process performance after the disassembly/reassembly of the electrodes, etc., a predetermined sample is subjected to the same plasma process as the actual one and the state of the processed sample is evaluated for adjustment.</p>
    <p num="19">
      However, in the method of subjecting the sample to the plasma process and evaluating the state of the processed sample for adjustment, since the state of the sample is evaluated, the evaluation method becomes an indirect one.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since the sample needs to be subjected to the same plasma process as the actual one, a long time is needed for the process.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In particular, if it is found from a sample evaluation result that a predetermined plasma process performance is not obtained, the plasma process performance of the sample has to be evaluated once again after the adjustment.
      <br/>
      This evaluation may be repeated until the predetermined plasma process performance is attained.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a longer time is needed, more samples are needed, and the cost increases.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="34">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="35">First Embodiment According to a plasma process end point determination apparatus of a first embodiment of the invention, when a plasma process end point in a process of producing a plasma within a reaction chamber and processing an object is to be determined, a physical quantity in a circuit for producing the plasma is measured and the plasma process end point is determined on the basis of an inflection point of the physical quantity with the passing of time.</p>
    <p num="36">
      Specifically, in the plasma process end point determination apparatus of this embodiment, a measurement signal obtained by measuring the physical quantity in the circuit for producing the plasma is passed through a median filter.
      <br/>
      The measurement signal which has been passed through the median filter is subjected to a weighted moving averaging process in accordance with a Gauss distribution.
      <br/>
      A primary differential value or a secondary differential value of the measurement signal, which has been subjected to the weighted moving averaging process, is found and compared with a predetermined threshold value.
      <br/>
      Thus the plasma process end point is determined.
    </p>
    <p num="37">FIG. 2 shows a plasma process end point determination apparatus according to the first embodiment of the invention.</p>
    <p num="38">
      As is shown in FIG. 1, a table 2 is disposed within a reaction chamber 1.
      <br/>
      A semiconductor wafer 3 or an object to be processed is placed on the table 2.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor wafer 3 is not a sample of an actual product, but is a wafer for use in determining the plasma process end point.
    </p>
    <p num="39">A reaction gas such as an etching gas is supplied into the reaction chamber 1.</p>
    <p num="40">
      A discharge electrode 4 is provided on the table 2 of reaction chamber 1.
      <br/>
      A radio-frequency (RF) power supply 6 is connected to the discharge electrode 4 via a matching circuit 5, thus constituting an RF circuit.
      <br/>
      That is, the RF circuit for producing a plasma in the reaction chamber comprises the discharge electrode 4, matching circuit 5 and RF power supply 6.
      <br/>
      The RF power supply 6 supplies a RF power to the discharge electrode 4 via the matching circuit 5 thereby emitting a plasma from the discharge electrode 4.
    </p>
    <p num="41">The matching circuit 5 is provided to effect matching between the RF power supply 6 and reaction chamber 1 and to prevent reflected power from returning to the RF power supply 6 when forward power is supplied from the RF power supply 6 to discharge electrode 4, thereby stabilizing a plasma discharge.</p>
    <p num="42">
      FIG. 3 shows an equivalent circuit of the matching circuit.
      <br/>
      The matching circuit, as shown in the figure, comprises variable capacitors Ca and Cb and a variable coil L. A resistance Z is provided between the matching circuit 5 and a grounded inner wall 1a of the reaction chamber 1.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      On the other hand, a waveguide window 7 formed of a dielectric material is provided on an upper part of the reaction chamber 1.
      <br/>
      A microwave generator 9 is connected to the waveguide window 7 via a microwave waveguide 8.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      A tuner 10 is formed in the microwave waveguide 8, and a plurality of stubs 11 are inserted in the tuner 10.
      <br/>
      The positions of insertion of the stubs 11 are adjusted so that the tuner 10 may function to control microwaves.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      A monitor 12 is connected between the discharge electrode 4 and matching circuit 5.
      <br/>
      The monitor 12 serves as physical quantity measuring means for measuring the physical quantity in the RF circuit for producing a plasma Q within the reaction chamber 1.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The monitor 12 measures, for example, a variation in reflected power within the reaction chamber 1 as the physical quantity in the RF circuit.
      <br/>
      The monitor 12 converts the measured variation value of reflected power to a voltage, digitizes the voltage, and outputs the resultant as a measurement signal.
    </p>
    <p num="47">An output terminal of the monitor 12 is connected to a computer 14 over a signal cable 13.</p>
    <p num="48">The computer 14 functions as plasma process end point determination means for receiving the measurement signal of reflected power from the monitor 12 and determining the plasma process end point on the basis of an inflection point of the reflected power relative to the passing of time.</p>
    <p num="49">A weighted moving averages section 15 has a function of passing the measurement signal of reflected power through the median filter and finding a weighted moving average in accordance with a Gauss distribution.</p>
    <p num="50">A determination section 16 finds a primary differential value or a secondary differential value of the value obtained by the averages section 15, and compares the found primary differential value or secondary differential value with a predetermined threshold value, thereby determining the plasma process end point.</p>
    <p num="51">The operation of the apparatus with the above-described structure will now be described.</p>
    <p num="52">The reaction chamber 1 is evacuated and a reaction gas such as an etching gas is supplied into the reaction chamber 1.</p>
    <p num="53">
      An RF power of, e.g. 300 to 1000 W is supplied from the RF power supply 6 to the discharge electrode 4 via the matching circuit 5, and the reaction gas present between the discharge electrode 4 and the grounded inner wall 1a of reaction chamber 1 is made into a plasma.
      <br/>
      Thus, the plasma etching process for the semiconductor wafer 3 placed within the reaction chamber 1 is performed.
    </p>
    <p num="54">The plasma Q may be produced within the reaction chamber 1 by guiding microwaves generated from the microwave generator 9 into the reaction chamber 1 via the microwave waveguide 8 as well as supplying the RF power from the RF power supply 6 to the discharge electrode 4.</p>
    <p num="55">It has turned out from experiments that at the end point of the etching process for the semiconductor wafer 3, the physical quantity in the RF circuit, e.g. the impedance of plasma Q, increases (or decreases) as shown in FIG. 4.</p>
    <p num="56">It has also turned out that at the end point of etching, other physical quantities in the RF circuit, such as voltage, current, reflection coefficient, voltage standing wave ratio, forward power, reflected power, effective power and reactive power, vary, too.</p>
    <p num="57">Accordingly, in the present apparatus, the plasma process end point is determined by detecting, e.g. the inflection point of variation of reflected power from the reactive chamber 1.</p>
    <p num="58">Specifically, the monitor 12 measures the reflected power varying due to an etching reaction within the reaction chamber 1, converts a value of a variation of the measured reflected power to a voltage, digitizes the voltage and outputs it as a measurement signal.</p>
    <p num="59">The computer 14 receives at a predetermined cycle the measurement signal of reflected power measured by the monitor 12 over the signal cable 13.</p>
    <p num="60">
      FIG. 5 shows an example of the waveform of the sampling value of the measured signal of reflected power, which was received in the computer 14.
      <br/>
      In fact, the waveform of the sampling value of reflected power is an aggregation of points of discrete values.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of convenience, however, the waveform is shown as a continuous curve.
      <br/>
      In the figures mentioned below, too, the waveform is shown as a continuous curve although it is actually the aggregation of points of discrete values.
    </p>
    <p num="61">The weighted moving averages section 15 of computer 14 passes the sampling value of the measurement signal through a general median filter and obtains a signal from which peculiar peaks have been removed, as shown in FIG. 6.</p>
    <p num="62">
      Suppose that the median-filtered sampling value at time t is S(t), as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The computer 14 compares a predetermined threshold value H0 with the sampling value S(t), and determines a time t0, at which the condition of S(t) &gt;= H0 is satisfied, to be an etching start time.
    </p>
    <p num="63">In addition, the computer 14 determines a time t1 (=t0+Td), which is delayed by a predetermined delay time Td, to be an arithmetic operation start time.</p>
    <p num="64">The weighted moving averages section 15 of computer 14 subjects the median-filtered sampling value S(t) to a weighted moving averaging process in accordance with a Gauss distribution.</p>
    <p num="65">If the sampling value obtained after the weighted moving averaging process is MWA(t), MWA(t) is given by  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="66">The Gauss distribution G(x) is considered only in a range of -M &lt;= x  &lt;= M with respect to a preset M. The Gauss distribution G(x) is expressed by  (Equation image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="67">where  SIGMA  is a preset standard deviation, and C is the number of a combination defined by  (Equation image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="68">FIG. 7 shows an example of the waveform of the thus obtained sampling value MWA(t) subjected to the weighted moving averaging process.</p>
    <p num="69">
      Subsequently, the determination section 16 performs a secondary differentiation of the sampling value MWA(t) obtained by the weighted moving averages section 15 and obtains a waveform D2(t) as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The waveform D2(t) is expressed by
      <br/>
      D2(t)=MWA(t)-2MWA(t-1)+MWA(t-2)  (4)
    </p>
    <p num="70">The determination section 16 then compares the waveform D2(5) with preset threshold values H1 and H2 and determines a time te, at which D2(t) satisfies the condition, D2(t)  &gt;= H1 or D2(t) &lt;= H2, with respect to threshold values H1 and H2, to be an etching process end point.</p>
    <p num="71">The computer 14 finds a time from the etching start to the etching end point as a time te-t0.</p>
    <p num="72">The reason why the two threshold values H1 and H2 are provided is that there are an increasing variation and a decreasing variation of the sampling value S(t) at the etching end point.</p>
    <p num="73">The above-described arithmetic operations are carried out at the same time as the sampling of the measurement signal of reflected power, and the etching end point is determined in real time relative to the progression of etching.</p>
    <p num="74">As has been described above, in the first embodiment, the reflected power in the RF circuit for producing a plasma is measured, and the measurement signal of reflected power is passed through the median filter.</p>
    <p num="75">
      The measurement signal, which has been passed through the median filter, is subjected to the weighted moving averaging process in accordance with the Gauss distribution, and the secondary differential value of the resultant signal value is found and compared with the preset threshold values.
      <br/>
      Thereby the etching process end point is determined.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the etching end point can be exactly determined without influences of contamination on the plasma light intake window or variance of plasma light.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Moreover, since the weighted moving averaging process is carried out, a time lag in a case of performing a moving averaging process twice or more or an influence in a case where a signal variation is small can be suppressed.
      <br/>
      Thus, a small signal variation can be detected with a small time lag, and the etching end point can be exactly determined.
    </p>
    <p num="77">Second Embodiment</p>
    <p num="78">A plasma process end point determination apparatus according to a second embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="79">In this invention, when a plasma process end point is determined in a process in which a plasma is produced within the reaction chamber to process an object, a physical quantity in a circuit for producing the plasma is measured and the measurement signal of the physical quantity is passed through a median filter.</p>
    <p num="80">
      Then, auto-correlation coefficients of the measurement signal which has been passed through the median filter are found successively, and these auto-correlation coefficients are compared with a preset threshold value.
      <br/>
      Thus, the plasma process end point is determined.

    <p num="111">While the etching for the semiconductor wafer 3 is progressing, the monitor 12 measures the reflected power varying due to an etching reaction within the reaction chamber 1, converts a value of a variation of the measured reflected power to a voltage, digitizes the voltage and outputs it as a measurement signal.</p>
    <p num="112">The computer 14 receives at a predetermined sampling cycle the measurement signal of reflected power measured by the monitor 12 via the cable 13 and obtains a waveform of the sampling value of the measurement signal, as shown in FIG. 5.</p>
    <p num="113">
      Like the first embodiment, the measurement signal of reflected power, which has been passed through the median filter, is subjected to the weighted moving averaging process in accordance with the Gauss distribution, and the secondary differential value of the resultant signal value is found and compared with the preset threshold values.

    <p num="115">For example, if an abnormal discharge of the plasma Q has occurred within the reaction chamber 1 or a defects has occurred in the process for the semiconductor wafer 3, such abnormality appears as specific pattern variation p1, p2 in the reflected power, for example, as shown in FIG. 13.</p>
    <p num="116">The abnormality determination section 30 detects such specific pattern variation p1, p2 and determines the occurrence of the abnormal discharge of plasma Q within the reaction chamber 1 or the defect in the process for semiconductor wafer 3.</p>
    <p num="117">The causes of abnormal discharge may be dust on the semiconductor wafer 3, short-circuit of wiring on the semiconductor wafer 3, degradation of components of the reaction chamber 1 (e.g. removal of alumite coating for insulation), etc.</p>

      As has been described above, according to the third embodiment of the invention, needless to say, the advantage of the first embodiment can be obtained.

      The present invention is not limited to the first to third embodiments of the invention.

      These embodiments may be modified as follows.

    <p num="121">
      For example, in the first to third embodiments, the reflected power is measured as physical quantity by using the monitor 12.
      <br/>
      However, one or more of the following physical quantities may be measured singly or in combination: impedance, voltage, current, reflection coefficient, voltage standing wave ratio, forward power, effective power, and reactive power in the RF circuit for producing the plasma.

    <p num="122">
      If voltage is V, current is I, impedance in the RF circuit is Z, reflection coefficient is  GAMMA  and voltage standing wave ratio is VSWR, then resistance R, reactance X and reflection coefficient  GAMMA  have the following relationships:

      The voltage standing wave ratio VSWR is expressed by
      <br/>
      VSWR=(1+ GAMMA )/(1- GAMMA )  (13)

    <p num="126">
      An adjustment value of the variable capacitor Ca, Cb or variable coil L in the matching circuit 5 for matching the reaction chamber 1 with the RF power supply for producing plasma Q may be employed to determine the etching end point.
      <br/>
      Specifically, since the matching circuit 5 adjusts the variable capacitor Ca, Cb or variable coil L for matching with the RF circuit, the inflection point of the adjustment value of variable capacitor Ca, Cb or variable coil L at the etching end point can be detected by monitoring this adjustment value.

    <p num="198">
      A sixth embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
      <br/>
      FIG. 18 shows a plasma evaluation apparatus to which a plasma evaluation method of the present invention is applied.
    </p>
    <p num="199">
      In FIG. 18, numeral 301 denotes a reaction chamber, and the inside thereof is sealed.
      <br/>
      Although not shown, the reaction chamber 301 is provided with a process gas supply section for supplying a process gas for etching, etc. into the chamber 301 and an exhaust section for exhausting a reaction gas, etc. within the reaction chamber 301.
      <br/>
      A table 302 with a discharge electrode 304, on which a semiconductor wafer 303 may be placed as an object to be processed, is provided in a bottom portion of the reaction chamber 301.
    </p>
    <p num="200">
      A radio-frequency power supply 307 is connected to the discharge electrode 304 via a monitor 305 serving as a physical quantity measuring section (described later) and a matching circuit 306, whereby a plasma producing circuit (an RF circuit) is constituted.
      <br/>
      If power is supplied from the RF power supply 307 to the discharge electrode 304, a discharge occurs between the discharge electrode 304 and the inner walls of the reaction chamber 301 and the process gas supplied in the reaction chamber 301 is activated and made into a plasma.
    </p>
    <p num="201">
      The matching circuit 306 establishes matching between the RF power supply 307 and reaction chamber 301, prevents reflected power from returning to the RF power supply 307 when power is supplied from the RF power supply 307 to the discharge electrode 304, and stabilizes the plasma discharge.
      <br/>
      As is shown in FIG. 19, the matching circuit 306 comprises variable capacitors Ca and Cb and variable coil L. A load Z is provided between the matching circuit 306 and a grounded inner wall 301a of reaction chamber 301.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      The monitor 305 provided between the discharge electrode 304 and RF power supply 307 serves as physical quantity measuring means for measuring a physical quantity in the RF circuit for producing the plasma Q within the reaction chamber 301.
      <br/>
      The physical quantity measured by the monitor 305 is, for example, an impedance in the RF circuit, voltage, current, reflection coefficient, voltage standing wave ratio, forward power, reflected power, effective power, or reactive power.
    </p>
    <p num="203">
      A computer 308 serving as comparison/evaluation means is connected to the monitor 305.
      <br/>
      The computer 308 converts a variation of a measured physical quantity, such as an impedance, to a voltage, digitizes the voltage, and outputs a digital measurement signal.
      <br/>
      The computer 308 has a function of receiving the measurement signal of the physical quantity measured by the monitor 305 and determining whether it is within a preset range.
    </p>
    <p num="204">The plasma evaluation method of this invention will now be described on the basis of the apparatus having the above structure.</p>
    <p num="205">
      If a process of etching or ashing is performed on an object for a long time, films will form on the electrode, the components of the electrode, the inner walls of the reaction chamber, etc., and the electrode and the components of the electrode will deteriorate.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a uniform plasma process cannot be performed.
      <br/>
      To solve this problem, the reaction chamber and electrode are disassembled after a predetermined time period, the formed films are washed away or the structural components are exchanged, and then the reaction chamber and electrode are reassembled.
    </p>
    <p num="206">
      After the plasma apparatus is reassembled, air is exhausted from the inside of the reaction chamber 301, a reaction gas such as an etching gas is supplied into the reaction chamber 301, and the pressure within the reaction chamber 301 is maintained at a predetermined level for the process.
      <br/>
      After the pressure within the reaction chamber 301 is stabilized, an RF power of, e.g. 300 to 1000 W is supplied from the RF power supply 307 to the discharge electrode 304 via the matching circuit 306.
      <br/>
      Then, the plasma Q is produced between the discharge electrode 304 and the inner walls of the reaction chamber 301.
    </p>
    <p num="207">The monitor 305 detects a variation in a physical quantity in the RF circuit which results from the production of the plasma Q, for example, a variation in impedance of the plasma Q. Apart from the impedance of plasma Q, the physical quantity in the RF circuit may be, for example, a voltage, current, reflection coefficient, voltage standing wave ratio, forward power, reflected power, effective power, or reactive power.</p>
    <p num="208">
      The monitor 305 converts the detected value of a variation of impedance due to the production of the plasma Q within the reaction chamber 301 to a voltage signal, digitizes the voltage signal, and outputs the digital voltage signal as a measurement signal to the computer 308 serving as comparison/evaluation section.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 20 to 22 show waveforms of the measurement signal obtained at this time.
      <br/>
      In fact, the waveforms of the signal are aggregations of points of discrete values.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of convenience, however, the waveforms are shown as continuous curves.
    </p>
    <p num="209">
      The computer 8 receives the measurement signal transmitted from the monitor 305 and determines whether the variation in impedance of the signal lies between preset upper limit and lower limit values.
      <br/>
      If the measurement signal exceeds the upper limit value, as shown in FIG. 21, or falls below the lower limit value, as shown in FIG. 22, it is determined that the assembly is not exactly made.
    </p>
    <p num="210">On the basis of the determination result, the operator reassembles and adjusts the reaction chamber 301 and electrode so that the variation in impedance of the plasma Q falls within the predetermined range.</p>
    <p num="211">
      The upper limit and lower limit values to be compared with the measurement signal sent from the monitor 305 are determined on the basis of the condition under which an optimal plasma Q was produced.
      <br/>
      However, these limit values may be determined, for example, on the basis of the condition before the disassembly/reassembly if the same process performance as before the disassembly/reassembly needs to be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="212">
      As has been described above, according to the sixth embodiment of the invention, a plasma is produced after disassembly/reassembly of the reaction chamber, electrode, etc., and the variation in the physical quantity due to the plasma is directly detected in order to evaluate the plasma produced after the reassembly.
      <br/>
      Thus, a direct determination, and not an indirect determination using a sample, can be performed.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since there is no need to perform a plasma process for the sample, the condition of the plasma can be evaluated with no time consumed for the process for the sample.
    </p>
    <p num="213">Since the sample is exposed to the plasma only in a time period for measuring the variation in physical quantity due to the production of plasma, the cost is reduced as compared to the prior art in which one sample is needed for each measuring operation.</p>
    <p num="214">
      An adjustment value of variable capacitor Ca, Cb or variable coil L in the matching circuit for establishing the matching between the reaction chamber 301 and the RF power supply for producing plasma Q may be used as the physical amount as a basis for evaluation of the produced plasma.
      <br/>
      Specifically, in the matching circuit 305, the variable capacitor Ca, Cb or variable coil L is adjusted for matching with the RF circuit.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the adjustment value of the variable capacitor Ca, Cb or variable coil L is detected and compared with a predetermined value, the reproducibility of the plasma can be evaluated.
    </p>
    <p num="215">As has been described above in detail, the present invention can provide a plasma evaluation method and apparatus which is efficient in time and cost and can evaluate the plasma in the reaction chamber directly from the physical quantity in the plasma producing circuit or matching circuit, and not indirectly with use of the process for the sample.</p>
    <p num="216">
      Additional advantages and modifications will readily occurs to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.
