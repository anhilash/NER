      Mammals are treated for infection or for conditions associated with pathologically proliferating mammalian cell growth (for example, certain cancers, restenosis, benign prostatic hypertrophy) by administration of a manipulator of nitrosative stress to selectively kill or reduce the growth of the microbes or helminths causing the infection or of host cells infected with the microbes or of the pathologically proliferating mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      Novel agents include alpha-alkyl-S-alkyl-homocysteine sulfoximines wherein the alpha-alkyl contains 2 to 8 carbon atoms, and the S-alkyl- contains 1 to 10 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      In another invention herein, mammals in need of increased nitrosative stress defenses are treated, e.g., humans at risk for a stroke because of having had a transient ischemic attack, are treated.
      <br/>
      Treatments to increase nitrosative stress defenses include, for example, repeated administrations of low doses of manipulators of nitrosative stress so that the subject treated has increased tolerance to nitrosative stress.
      <br/>
      In still another invention, mammals are treated for protozoal infections by systemic administration of L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine and agent that increases nitrosative stress.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Nitric oxide (NO) is now recognized as a signaling molecule in biology and has been implicated in the function of virtually every organ system in mammals.
      <br/>
      It is known that NO relaxes blood vessels, intestines, airways and skeletal muscles and plays a role in memory, sexual behavior and host defense.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, excessive production of NO has been implicated in organ dysfunction, degenerative disease and promotion of cancer.
      <br/>
      Arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Alzheimer's disease, congestive heart failure, septic shock and atherosclerosis are disorders in which NO may play a pathogenic role.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is recognized that there is normally a certain amount of endogenously produced oxidative stress in mammals, i.e., the endogenous production of reactive oxygen species in the body, e.g., superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, hypochlorous acid and singlet oxygen.
      <br/>
      This is thought to contribute to ageing, rheumatism, atherosclerosis, inflammation, respiratory distress syndrome, fibrosis, and development of infectious diseases such as AIDS.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Before the discovery leading to the inventions herein, it was not recognized that there is a nitrosative stress distinct from oxidative stress that affects mammals and also microorganisms which can be manipulated in a therapeutically effective manner, either by decreasing microbial, helminth or pathologically proliferating mammalian cell defenses against nitrosative stress or by imposing a nitrosative stress or by upregulating nitrosative stress defenses.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">We turn firstly to the inventions herein related to manipulating nitrosative stress to kill or reduce the growth of pathologic microbes or pathologic helminths or pathologically proliferating mammalian cells.</p>
    <p num="8">It has been discovered that cells producing or exposed to nitric oxide related compounds as defined below are subjected to nitrosative stress.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The term "nitric oxide related compounds" is used herein to mean compounds able to transfer NO+, NO- or NO2+ group to biological molecules.
      <br/>
      The term does not include nitric oxide itself.
      <br/>
      Nitric oxide itself is not a nitrosative stress agent.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The term "nitrosative stress" is used herein to mean an impetus for NO or NO2 group attachment to proteins, nucleic acids or other biological molecules.
      <br/>
      It may be potentially therapeutic if microbes, helminths or pathologically proliferating mammalian cells are affected or potentially pathologic if normal mammalian cells are damaged.
      <br/>
      Nitrosative stress is distinct from oxidative stress and can occur under anaerobic conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      It has further been discovered that to prevent damage from nitrosative stress, cells exhibit constitutive defenses as well as an adaptive response that applies to microorganisms including bacteria as well as to helminths and to mammalian cells including human cells.
      <br/>
      An important aspect of this adaptive response is that it is distinct in its regulation and in its molecular purpose from the adaptive response to oxidative stress.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it has been discovered that cells upregulate resistance genes and other biochemical pathways to protect themselves from nitrosative stress.
      <br/>
      Thiols (e.g., glutathione in mammals and glutathione-producing helminths and microorganisms, L-homocysteine, mycothiol, ovothiols, etc.) and enzymes which mediate constitutive thiol synthesis comprise the first line of defense.
      <br/>
      Antinitrosative stress genes and their products comprise a second line of defense.
    </p>
    <p num="12">The term "antinitrosative stress gene" is used herein to mean a gene coding for a product that when expressed either breaks down or eliminates nitrosants (nitrosating species), denitrosates nitrosatively inhibited proteins or other biological molecules to restore their function, or upregulates other products or pathways which are protective against nitrosative stress.</p>
    <p num="13">
      An embodiment of the invention herein involves selective manipulation of nitrosative stress so that it selectively affects pathologic microbe proliferation or survival or pathologic helminth proliferation or survival or pathologic cell proliferation, growth or survival in mammals (including humans).
      <br/>
      This manipulation of nitrosative stress can be in microbes infecting the mammals or in mammalian cells infected with pathologic microbes to selectively kill or inhibit the microbes or the host cells containing the microbes or in pathologic helminths infecting the mammal to selectively kill or inhibit the helminths or in pathologically proliferating mammalian cells, e.g., to selectively kill target cells (e.g., proliferating cancer cells or cells proliferating to cause restenosis or benign prostatic hypertrophy).
      <br/>
      The invention of this embodiment is a method of inhibiting growth of pathologic microbes or pathologic helminths or pathologically proliferating mammalian cells, in a mammal, and comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutic pathologic microbe or pathologic helminth or pathologically proliferating mammalian cell antiproliferative effective amount of one or more manipulators of nitrosative stress in said microbes or in mammalian host cells infected with said microbes or in said helminths or in said pathologically proliferating cells whereby nitrosative stress selectively kills or reduces the growth of said microbes or helminths or mammalian cells or selectively enhances their susceptibility to innate immune defenses or the susceptibility of said microbes to antimicrobial agents (that function by a mechanism other than by manipulating nitrosative stress) or the susceptibility of said helminths to anthelmintic agents (which function by a mechanism other than by manipulating nitrosative stress) or the susceptibility of said pathologically proliferating mammalian cells to antiproliferation agents (that function by a mechanism other than by manipulating nitrosative stress); provided that when the pathologically proliferating mammalian cells are those that would cause restenosis, the manipulator(s) of nitrosative stress comprise(s) an inhibitor of protection against nitrosative stress and is (are) employed to selectively kill or reduce the growth of said cells or to enhance their susceptibility to antiproliferation agents, i.e., to anti-restenosis drugs that function by a mechanism other than by manipulating nitrosative stress.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The terms "pathologic microbes" and "pathologic microorganisms" as used herein mean pathologic microorganisms including but not limited to pathologic bacteria, pathologic viruses, pathologic Chlamydia, pathologic protozoa, pathologic Rickettsia, pathologic fungi, and pathologic mycoplasmata.</p>
    <p num="15">The term "host cells infected with pathologic microbes" includes not only mammalian cells infected with pathologic viruses but also mammalian cells containing intracellular bacteria or protozoa, e.g., macrophages containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leper (leprosy), or Salmonella typhi (typhoid fever).</p>
    <p num="16">The term "pathologic helminths" as used herein refers to pathologic nematodes, pathologic trematodes and pathologic cestodes.</p>
    <p num="17">The term "pathologically proliferating mammalian cells" as used herein means cells of the mammal that grow in size or number in said mammal so as to cause a deleterious effect in the mammal or its organs.</p>
    <p num="18">The term "selectively kills or reduces the growth of said microbes or helminths or mammalian cells" as used herein means kills or reduces growth of pathologic microbes or host cells containing pathologic microbes or pathologic helminths or pathologically proliferating mammalian cells without causing unacceptable killing or inhibition of growth of normal mammalian cells or kills or reduces growth of mammalian host cells containing pathologic microbes or pathologically proliferating mammalian cells in a percentage which is at least 10% greater than the percentage of normal mammalian cells adversely affected.</p>
    <p num="19">The term "therapeutic pathologic microbe or pathologic helminth or pathologically proliferating mammalian cell antiproliferative effective amount" as used herein means amount causing reduction in rate of proliferation of at least 10%.</p>
    <p num="20">The term "antiproliferative agent" is used herein to mean anticancer agent useful to inhibit growth of pathologically proliferating cancer cells or anti-restenosis drug useful to inhibit growth of pathologically proliferating cells that would cause restenosis or drug used to inhibit growth of pathologically proliferating cells causing benign prostatic hypertrophy or drug inhibiting growth of other kinds of pathologically proliferating cells, that does not function by manipulating nitrosative stress.</p>
    <p num="21">
      So far as microbes are concerned, the method is for inhibiting growth of pathologic microbes in a mammal and said method comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutic pathologic microbe antiproliferative effective amount of one or more manipulators of nitrosative stress in said microbes or in host cells infected with said microbes whereby nitrosative stress selectively kills or reduces the growth of said microbes or enhances their susceptibility to innate immune defenses or their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
      <br/>
      In a narrow embodiment herein where the microbes are protozoa, the manipulator of nitrosative stress administered is one that increases nitrosative stress in the pathologic microbes, or a manipulator of nitrosative stress administered is one that selectively inhibits protection against nitrosative stress in the pathologic protozoa but does not increase nitrosative stress in the pathologic protozoa and other manipulator of nitrosative stress is also administered which increases nitrosative stress in the pathologic protozoa, or a manipulator of nitrosative stress is administered which is a selective inhibitor of thiol synthesis by the protozoa.
      <br/>
      In a narrow embodiment herein where manipulator of nitrosative stress is administered which inhibits OxyR transcription or translation in microbes containing OxyR, manipulator of nitrosative stress is also administered which increases nitrosative stress in the pathologic microbes containing OxyR or which inhibits protection against nitrosative stress in said microbes in a way other than by inhibiting OxyR transcription or translation.
    </p>
    <p num="22">So far as helminths are concerned, the method is for inhibiting the growth of pathologic helminths in a mammal and said method comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutic pathologic helminth antiproliferative effective amount of a manipulator of nitrosative stress in said helminths whereby nitrosative stress selectively kills or reduces the growth of said helminths or enhances their susceptibility to innate immune defenses or their susceptibility to anthelmintic agents.</p>
    <p num="23">So far as pathologically proliferating mammalian cells are concerned, the method is for inhibiting the growth of pathologically proliferating mammalian cells in a mammal and comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutic pathologically proliferating mammalian cell antiproliferative effective amount of one or more manipulators of nitrosative stress in said cells whereby nitrosative stress selectively kills or reduces the growth of said cells or enhances their susceptibility to innate immune defenses or enhances their susceptibility to antiproliferation agents; except that when the pathologically proliferating mammalian cells are those that would cause restenosis, the manipulator(s) of nitrosative stress comprise(s) an inhibitor of protection against nitrosative stress (e.g., one or more inhibitors of protection against nitrosative stress are used as the only kind of manipulator of nitrosative stress or two kinds of manipulators of nitrosative stress are employed where one kind of manipulator of nitrosative stress is inhibitor of protection against nitrosative stress and the other kind of manipulator of nitrosative stress is agent which increases nitrosative stress) and is (are) employed to selectively kill or reduce the growth of said cells or to enhance their susceptibility to antiproliferation agents, i.e., to anti-restenosis drugs that function by a mechanism other than by manipulating nitrosative stress.</p>
    <p num="24">We turn now to special cases mentioned above.</p>
    <p num="25">
      It is known in the prior art to inhibit growth of protozoa by inhibiting thiol synthesis therein.
      <br/>
      In this regard, see Arrick, B. A., Griffith, O. W., and Cerami, A. J., Exp. Med. 153, 720-725 (1981).
      <br/>
      However, the mechanism for growth inhibition of protozoa of inhibiting protection against nitrosative stress has not heretofore been known, and administration of microbe selective thiol production inhibiting agents to mammals to inhibit growth of protozoa therein is not exemplified in the prior art.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is not known in the prior art to inhibit growth of protozoa in mammals by therapeutic administration to increase nitrosative stress therein.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is not known in the prior art to combine increased nitrosative stress with thiol depletion or other strategies for decreasing defenses against nitrosative stress, for inhibiting growth of protozoa in mammals.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      It is known in the prior art that OxyR protects bacteria from oxidative stress but the role of OxyR in providing protection against nitrosative stress has not heretofore been known.
      <br/>
      In this regard, see Papp-Szabo, B., et al., Infection and Immunity 62, 2662-2668 (1994).
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is not known in the prior art to administer inhibitor of OxyR transcription or translation to mammals to inhibit growth of bacteria therein, and it is not known in the prior art to inhibit growth of or to kill bacteria by therapeutically increasing nitrosative stress therein.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      It is known in the prior art to insert NO releasing stents during angioplasty.
      <br/>
      However, it is not known in the prior art to administer manipulator of nitrosative stress which inhibits protection against nitrosative stress to selectively kill or reduce the growth of pathologically proliferating cells that would cause restenosis or to selectively enhance their susceptibility to antiproliferation agents that function by a mechanism other than by manipulating nitrosative stress.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is not known in the prior art to concurrently administer manipulator of nitrosative stress which increases nitrosative stress and manipulator of nitrosative stress which inhibits protection against nitrosative stress in the pathologically proliferating cells that would cause restenosis.
    </p>
    <p num="28">We turn now to various kinds of manipulators of nitrosative stress.</p>
    <p num="29">
      One kind of manipulator of nitrosative stress is a selective inhibitor of protection against nitrosative stress in the pathologic microbes or in host cells infected with pathologic microbes or in the pathologic helminths or in the pathologically proliferating mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      The term "selective inhibitor" is used in the prior sentence to refer to agent which in use downregulates nitrosative stress defense mechanism in the pathologic microbes or in mammalian host cells infected with pathologic microbes or in pathologic helminths or in pathologically proliferating mammalian cells so as to effect or mediate the selective killing or growth reduction recited above.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      One kind of selective inhibitor of protection against nitrosative stress is a selective inhibitor of thiol synthesis or selective depleter of thiol in the pathologic microbes or in mammalian host cells infected with pathologic microbes or in pathologic helminths or in pathologically proliferating mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      The term "selective inhibitor of thiol synthesis" as used herein refers to synthesis from amino acids or other precursors and means a selective inhibition of a distinct enzyme present in the pathologic microbes or in the pathologic helminths (i.e., a microbe-selective or helminth selective thiol synthesis inhibiting agent) or to selective application or action of an inhibitor of thiol synthesis which is itself not selective for inhibition of thiol synthesis in pathologically proliferating microbes or helminths or mammalian cells but which achieves selective result because of coaction with drug that has more specific application or action or by virtue of local delivery.
      <br/>
      The term "selective depleter of thiol" as used herein means agents which conjugate with thiols; agents transferring nitroso (--NO) or nitro (--NO2) groups to thiols which, when administered systemically to the mammal, are selective for pathologic microbes infecting the mammal, host cells containing pathologic microbes, pathologic helminths infecting the mammal or pathologically proliferating mammalian cells; alkylating agents administered systemically to a mammal to inhibit growth of pathologic microbes in the mammal infected with the microbes or to inhibit growth of pathologic helminths in the mammal infected with the helminths; depleters of thiol that are administered locally;
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      and prodrugs for agents causing thiol depletion, which are activated in pathologic microbes or in pathologic microbe-infected cells or in pathologic helminths.
      <br/>
      The term "selective depleter of thiol" as used herein excludes the systemic administration of alkylating agents to mammals to inhibit growth of pathologically proliferating mammalian cells, the systemic administration of agents which cause thiol oxidation to disulfides and the systemic administration of thiol reductase (e.g., glutathione reductase also known as glutathione disulfide reductase) inhibitors, except when these agents or inhibitors are used with agents that increase nitrosative stress.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Another kind of selective inhibitor of protection against nitrosative stress is a selective inhibitor of transcription or translation of an antinitrosative stress gene (as defined above) or a selective inhibitor of an antinitrosative stress gene product.
      <br/>
      OxyR is a transcription factor in E. coli and Salmonella which has been discovered by us to be upregulated by nitrosative stress as described in Hausladen, A., et al., Cell, Vol. 86, pages 11-20 (1996).
      <br/>
      As indicated above, in a narrow embodiment herein where manipulator of nitrosative stress is administered which inhibits the transcription factor OxyR in microbes containing it, manipulator of nitrosative stress is also administered which inhibits protection against nitrosative stress in the microbes in a way other than by inhibiting OxyR transcription or translation or which increases nitrosative stress, e.g., two kinds of manipulators of nitrosative stress are administered and one kind inhibits OxyR transcription or translation and the other kind selectively inhibits thiol synthesis or depletes thiol in the microbe or increases nitrosative stress in the microbe.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Another kind of manipulator of nitrosative stress useful in the method described above is an agent that selectively increases nitrosative stress in the pathologic microbes or in the pathologic helminths or in the pathologically proliferating mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      The term "agent that increases nitrosative stress" refers to an agent that imposes nitrosative stress and includes nitrosating agent, that is agent that transfers NO+, NO- or NO2+ group, or prodrug causing this effect, or an agent that activates or induces nitric oxide synthase or nitrogen oxide producing enzyme where nitrogen oxide is in part converted to nitric oxide related compounds.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment herein, the manipulator of nitrosative stress is not agent that activates or induces mammalian nitric oxide synthase or other nitrogen oxide producing enzyme and nitrosative stress is not imposed by conversion of nitrogen oxide to nitric oxide related compounds in the body.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In one aspect of the invention, the inhibition is carried out on pathologic microbes or pathologic helminths and the manipulator of nitrosative stress is one that selectively delivers nitrosating agent to the pathologic microbes or to host cells containing the pathologic microbes or to the pathologic helminths, i.e., agent that transfers NO+, NO- or NO2+ group to the pathologic microbes or to the pathologic helminths.
      <br/>
      This type of manipulator of nitrosative stress can be an organic or inorganic nitrate or nitrite that selectively delivers nitrosating agent to the microbes or helminths.
      <br/>
      Such manipulator of nitrosative stress can be selected from the group consisting of substrates for nitrite reductase or nitrate reductase and nitrogen-oxide substrates for microbial sulfite metabolizing enzymes.
      <br/>
      Another example of manipulator of nitrosative stress that selectively delivers nitrosating agent to the pathologic microbes or to host cells containing them or to the pathologic helminths is antibiotic or drug that kills or reduces growth of said microbes (including antiviral compounds) or helminths, substituted to transfer NO+, NO- or NO2+ group, to the microbes or helminths.

      For inhibiting proliferation of pathologically proliferating cancer cells, aminotriazole is made selective by cross-linking by an amide linkage to antitumor antibody (i.e., to an epitope of a cancer cell) and the selective agent is administered intravenously at a dosage of 10  MU g to 100 mg/kg mammalian body weight per day.
      <br/>
      For inhibiting proliferation of pathologically proliferating cells that would cause restenosis, aminotriazole is made selective by attachment (e.g., by amide linkage) to polymer of a polymer stent or by incorporation into a porous polymer stent in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 10% by weight of the polymer in the stent and the rate of drug release should be such that the duration of drug therapy following implantation of the stent is 1 to 20 days or longer.
      <br/>
      For inhibiting the proliferation of pathologically proliferating cells causing benign prostatic hypertrophy, aminotriazole is made selective by attachment to polymer (e.g., by amide linkage) of a polymer pellet which is implanted into the prostate or by incorporation into a porous polymer pellet from which it slowly diffuses once the pellet is implanted into the prostate.
      <br/>
      In these cases, the aminotriazole is employed in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 10% by weight of the polymer in the pellet, and the rate of drug release should be such that the duration of therapy following implantation of the pellet is 1 to 20 days.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      Another example of an inhibitor of an antinitrosative stress gene product for administration to a mammal to inhibit the proliferation (growth) of pathologically proliferating cells in the mammal is an inhibitor of heme oxygenase, e.g., tin protoporphyrin IX and zinc protoporphyrin IX.
      <br/>
      These compounds are made selective by local delivery or, in the case of proliferating cancer cells, by attachment to a tumor specific antibody.
      <br/>
      In the former case, they may be administered from a stent or an implant pellet where they are present in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 10% by weight of the polymer in the stent or pellet and the rate of release is such that duration of drug therapy following implantation is 1 to 20 days or longer.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, administration is preferably intravenous at a dosage of 1  MU g to 100 mg/kg mammalian body weight per day.

      In one embodiment herein, the selective inhibitors of protection against nitrosative stress in application to killing microbes or helminths are administered in combination with cytokines which activate immune cells to kill microbes or helminths.
      <br/>
      These cytokines include, for example, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, interleukin-2, and interferon-gamma.
      <br/>
      Dosages for the cytokines are in the range of 0.01  MU g to 100  MU g/kg body weight and administration is intravenous.

    <p num="114">The inventions herein do not include inhibiting the growth of proliferating mammalian cancer cells by administering an inhibitor of protection against nitrosative stress which is not itself selective for the proliferating cancer cells, e.g., L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine, and also anticancer agent that inhibits proliferation of mammalian cancer cells by a mechanism other than by manipulating nitrosative stress, without administration of agent that increases nitrosative stress.</p>
    <p num="115">We turn now to cases where the manipulator of nitrosative stress is an agent that selectively increases nitrosative stress in pathologic microbes or in pathologic helminths or in pathologically proliferating mammalian cells.</p>
    <p num="116">We turn now to the case where the agent that selectively increases nitrosative stress is one that is to be administered to a microbe-infected mammal to inhibit growth of the microbe in the mammal.</p>
    <p num="117">
      In one case of this kind, the agent is one that selectively delivers nitrosating agent, i.e., agent that releases NO+, NO- or NO2+ group, to the microbe.
      <br/>
      An agent of this kind is antibiotic or drug that kills or reduces growth of infecting microbes, substituted to transfer NO+, NO- or NO2+ group to the microbes on being metabolized or taken up by the microbes.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      Many antibiotics are taken up by all cells, both mammalian and microbial.
      <br/>
      Nonetheless, there is selectivity for microbial killing because the antibiotic and nitrosating agent act synergistically in the microbes to cause killing, whereas in normal mammalian cells, the antibiotic has no cell killing effect and therefore there is no synergy with the nitrosating agent.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      On the other hand, there are some antibiotics that are selectively taken up into microbes.
      <br/>
      For example, quinine, a drug used against the malaria parasite P. fulciparum, is highly concentrated in the acidic food vacuoles of that parasite.
      <br/>
      Metronidazole, used against Bacteroids, Clostridium and Heliobacter species, is selectively toxic to these anaerobic or microaerophilic microorganisms because it is in these environments that it is reductively activated.
      <br/>
      Sodium stibogluconate used to treat L. donovoni infections in hamsters is selectively taken up by endocytosis to reach the phagolysosomes of macrophages where parasites reside.
      <br/>
      A number of anti-viral nucleoside drugs such as zidovudine (AZT), acyclovir, penciclovir, and the prodrug famciclovir are concentrated in virus-infected cells by virtue of an initial phosphorylation that requires a viral rather than a mammalian enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      The antibiotics (including antivirals) and drugs which are substituted to contain moiety that transfers NO+, NO- or NO2+ group to infecting microbes can be made from antibiotics and drugs which are not so substituted, for example, by conversion of hydroxy groups with NO to nitrite esters or with NO2 to nitrate esters, by substitution of a primary or secondary amino group with a hydroxy acid (e.g., glycolic acid) followed by conversion of the hydroxy groups to nitrite esters and nitrate esters, by conversion of a secondary amino function to a NONOate species which release NO, some fraction of which would be expected to be converted to nitrosating agent in vivo, by conversion of thiol groups to S-nitrosothiols, e.g., by treatment with acidified sodium nitrite, and by substitution of primary and secondary amino groups or hydroxyl groups with a thiol acid (e.g., thiolacetic acid) to give the corresponding amide or ester and provide a thiol group which is converted to S-nitrosothiol group as described above.
      <br/>
      For peptide antibiotics that do not contain cysteine residues, it is possible to replace valine or alanine residues with cysteine with a high expectation that antibiotic activity will not be affected and then to convert the thiol moiety to S-nitrosothiol as described above.

    <p num="122">Another agent of the kind that selectively delivers nitrosating agent to microbes that is administered to a microbe-infected mammal to inhibit growth of the microbe in the mammal is substrate for nitrate or nitrite reductase or nitrogen oxide substrate for sulfite metabolizing enzyme or is organic or inorganic nitrate or nitrite that selectively delivers nitrosating agent to the microbes, and includes, for example, sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, calcium nitrate, calcium nitrite and transition metal-NO complexes.</p>
    <p num="123">
      Still another agent of the kind that selectively delivers nitrosating agent to microbes that is administered to a microbe-infected mammal to inhibit growth of the microbe in the mammal is agent selected from the group consisting of S-nitroso-gamma-methyl-L-homocysteine, S-nitroso-L-homocysteine, S-nitroso-gamma-thio-L-leucine, S-nitroso- DELTA -thio-L-leucine and tripeptides in which two of the residues are selected from the group consisting of serine, glutamine, alanine, leucine, and methionine, and the other residue is S-nitrosocysteine.
      <br/>
      These are S-nitroso containing compounds based on peptides or amino acids known to be taken up by microbes. S-Nitroso-gamma-methyl-L-homocysteine can be prepared by reacting gamma-methyl-L-homocysteine with acidified sodium nitrite; gamma-methyl-L-homocysteine can be prepared by sodium/liquid ammonia cleavage of the S-methyl group from gamma-methyl-L-methionine, the synthesis of which is well known in the art. S-Nitroso-L-homocysteine can be prepared by reaction of L-homocysteine with acidified sodium nitrite. S-Nitroso-gamma-thio-L-leucine can be prepared by reacting gamma-thio-L-leucine with acidified sodium nitrite; gamma-thio-L-leucine can be prepared by conventional Strecker amino acid synthesis from S-benzyl- BETA , BETA -dimethyl- BETA -thiopropionaldehyde followed by reductive removal of the S-benzyl group using sodium in liquid ammonia and resolution of the D,L racemate by established procedures (e.g., by acetylation of the amino group and selective cleavage of the L-enantiomer using kidney acylase). S-Benzyl- BETA , BETA -dimethyl- BETA -thiopropionaldehyde is prepared by addition of benzyl mercaptan to  BETA , BETA -dimethylacrylaldehyde. S-Nitroso- DELTA -thio-L-leucine can be prepared by reacting  DELTA -thio-L-leucine with acidified sodium nitrite.  DELTA -Thio-L-leucine can be prepared by reacting diethylacetamidomalonate with S-benzyl- ALPHA -methyl- BETA -thiopropyl bromide followed by acid hydrolysis of the ethyl esters and acetamido group and spontaneous decarboxylation of the resulting  ALPHA -substituted malonic acid.
      <br/>
      The S-benzyl group is reductively removed using sodium and liquid ammonia and the D,L-racemate is resolved by established procedures as described for gamma-thio-L-leucine.
      <br/>
      The required S-benzyl- ALPHA -methyl- BETA -thiopropyl bromide is synthesized by reacting excess 1,3-dibromo- ALPHA -methyl propane with benzyl mercaptan.
      <br/>
      The tripeptides in which two of the residues are selected from the group consisting of serine, glutamine, alanine, leucine, and methionine and the other residue is S-nitrosocysteine can be prepared in un-nitrosolated form, for example, by conventional peptide synthesis procedures well established in the art including use of automated peptide synthesis instruments and then S-nitrosolated using acidified sodium nitrite.

      For the tripeptides, the route of administration is preferably intravenous.
      <br/>
      For the tripeptides, oral administration is not appropriate except in the case of infections of the gastrointestinal tract since the tripeptides would be digested in the gastrointestinal tract, and therefore, in most cases of orally administered compounds would not be absorbed as intact peptides.

      Selectivity is present because there is synergy between the activity of the anthelmintic agent and the additional toxicity of nitrosative stress that provides a selective effect.

      In the case where the pathologically proliferating cells are cancer cells, a manipulator of nitrosative stress that selectively increases nitrosative stress in the pathologically proliferating cancer cells is a chemotherapeutic agent useful for treating the type of cancer involved derivatized to release and transfer NO+, NO- or NO2+ group to said cells.
      <br/>
      Metabolism in the pathologically proliferating cancer cells causes release and transfer of NO+, NO- or NO2+ group to the cancer cells leaving active chemotherapeutic agent.

      <br/>
      Excluded from coverage herein is the use of traditional chemotherapeutic agents which are nitrosating agents even though they have not been modified, e.g., hydroxyurea which is a hydroxyguanidine compound and is converted to nitric oxide related compound in vivo, except when they are used in combination with manipulator of nitrosative stress which is not a traditional chemotherapeutic agent.
      <br/>
      One important kind of manipulator of nitrosative stress that is chemotherapeutic agent derivatized to release and transfer NO+, NO- or NO2+ group to pathologically proliferating cancer cells is alkylating agent derivatized to release and transfer NO+, NO- or NO2+ group, for example, the nitrate ester of  BETA -hydroxy melphalan, an analog of mechlorethamine in which the N-methyl group is replaced by --CH2 CH2 ONO2 or --CH2 CH2 SNO or --CH2 CH2 ONO, AZQ (diazoquone) in which the ethoxy moieties of the side chains are replaced by --OCH2 CH2 ONO2 or --OCH2 CH2 SNO or --OCH2 CH2 ONO, nitrate and nitrite esters of dianhydrogalactitol or dibromodulcitol and busulfan and hepsulfan (which contain covalently reactive alkylating moieties separated by linear alkyl chains of 4 and 7 carbon atoms respectively) where any of methylene moieties of said alkyl chains but the terminal methylene moieties are replaced with --CHSNO-- or --CHONO-- or --CHONO2 --; these derivatized alkylating agents are important because the alkylating moiety therein causes depletion of glutathione and thereby decreases defenses against nitrosative stress.
      <br/>
      Other manipulators of nitrosative stress that are chemotherapeutic agents derivatized to release and transfer NO+, NO- or NO2+ group, include NO-substituted doxorubicin (doxorubicin causes oxidative stress which causes accumulation of glutathione disulfide at the expense of glutathione), NO-substituted daunorubicin, NO-substituted epirubicin, NO-substituted idarubucin, NO-substituted actinomycin D and NO-substituted BCNU (carmustine).

    <p num="132">
      The derivatizing of a chemotherapeutic agent to release and transfer NO+, NO- or NO2+ group can be carried out by standard chemical procedures.
      <br/>
      The chemical synthesis of each of the parent compounds is well-known in the literature, and the processing steps necessary to achieve the modifications described are obvious to one skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      The same general procedures as described above for derivatizing antibiotics and antivirals can be used.
      <br/>
      For example, the established syntheses for each of the agents can be altered so as to generate a thiol group at positions intended to be present as --SNO or a hydroxyl group at positions intended to be occupied by --ONO or --ONO2 if thiol or hydroxy group is not already present.
      <br/>
      Procedures for then converting the thiol or the hydroxy moieties to S-nitroso thiols or nitrite/nitrate esters, respectively are well-known.
      <br/>
      In particular, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin and actinomycin D are easily derivatized to nitrite or nitrate esters on any of the available hydroxyl moieties and all contain an amino sugar that can be derivatized with thiol acids to provide a thiol group that can be reacted with acidified sodium nitrite to form S-nitrosothiol.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      In the case of the derivatized chemotherapeutic agents, the selectivity is caused by the chemotherapeutic moiety.
      <br/>
      While there is no selectivity for the chemotherapeutic moieties in terms of drug uptake, there is synergy between the activity of the original chemotherapeutic agent against rapidly dividing cells with the additional cytotoxicity of nitrosative stress that provides a selective effect.
      <br/>
      To the extent that the derivatized therapeutic agents are taken up by normal cells, the nitrosative stress so delivered is not expected to be unacceptably cytotoxic because the alkylating activity of the agent is not highly effective against non-dividing cells.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      The dosage for the derivatized chemotherapeutic agents is preferably the same as the dosage employed for the same chemotherapeutic agent which is not derivatized to release and transfer NO+, NO- or NO2+ group, except that in cases where NO-substitution reduces the inherent chemotherapeutic efficacy of the drug, the NO-substituted drug is administered at higher dose so as to attain or exceed the original chemotherapeutic efficacy.
      <br/>
      The route of administration for the derivatized chemotherapeutic agents is the same as that employed for the same chemotherapeutic agent which is not derivatized.
      <br/>
      For example, the recommended dosage for melphalan ranges from 0.1 to 2.5 mg/kg and the preferred route of administration is oral or intravenous and the same dosage range and route of administration can be employed in the invention herein for melphalan derivatized to release and transfer NO+, NO- or NO2 + group.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      Another kind of manipulator of nitrosative stress that selectively increases nitrosative stress in pathologically proliferating cancer cells is nitrosating agent, preferably S-nitrosothiol, employed with chemotherapeutic agent (which functions by a mechanism other than by manipulating nitrosative stress).
      <br/>
      Selectivity is caused by the chemotherapeutic agent.
      <br/>
      While there is no selectivity for the nitrosating agent in terms of drug uptake, there is selectivity of effect between the activity of the chemotherapeutic agent and the nitrosating agent with the nitrosating agent providing additional cytotoxic effect in respect to the proliferating cells.
      <br/>
      Examples of S-nitrosothiols are the same as those listed above in respect to treating helminth infections.
      <br/>
      The dosage for the nitrosating agent ranges from 1 mg to 10 gm/kg body weight per day with oral administration being preferred with other routes of administration including parenteral (e.g., intravenous) also being useful.
      <br/>
      The chemotherapeutic agents are used in the same dosages and with the same routes of administration as are employed when they are used without nitrosating agents.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      Another kind of manipulator of nitrosative stress that selectively increases nitrosative stress in pathologically proliferating cancer cells is antitumor antibody (i.e., to an epitope on a cancer cell) to which has been attached nitrosative stress agent such as S-nitrosothiol.
      <br/>
      For example, reaction of the antitumor antibody with methyl 3-(S-nitroso)propionimidate derivatives solvent exposed amino groups of lysine side chains to form stable amidine linkages with the S-nitrosothiol (i.e., ONSCH2 CH2 C(.dbd.NH2+)--NH-Lys).
      <br/>

      In a preferred method applicable to mammals afflicted with pathologically proliferating cancer cells, two kinds of manipulators of nitrosative stress are administered, and one kind is an inhibitor of protection against nitrosative stress and the other kind is an agent that increases nitrosative stress and one or both of the two kinds of manipulators of nitrosative stress is(are) selective for effect in the cancer cells.
      <br/>
      A manipulator of nitrosative stress that may be administered in this embodiment to inhibit protection against nitrosative stress which is not selective for this purpose in pathologically proliferating cancer cells is, for example, L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine (for which the dosage ranges from 1 to 50 mmol per kg mammal body weight per day and the route of administration is preferably intravenous).

      Manipulators of nitrosative stress that may be used in this embodiment to selectively increase nitrosative stress in pathologically proliferating cancer cells are the chemotherapeutic agents derivatived to release and transfer NO+, NO- or NO2+ group described above, and the dosages and routes of administration described above in conjunction with these agents may be used for these agents in this embodiment, or are antitumor antibodies to which have been attached nitrosative stress agents as described above utilized with the dosages and routes of administration described above in connection with them.
      <br/>
      Manipulators of nitrosative stress that may be used in this embodiment to increase nitrosative stress in pathologically proliferating cancer cells which are not selective for this purpose are, for example, S-nitrosocysteine, nitroglycerine, and amyl nitrite, and the dosages and routes of administration associated with each of these are respectively 10 mg to 1 gm (oral or intravenous), 1 to 5 mg (orally) or 5  MU g/min (intravenous) and 0.1 to 0.3 ml (inhaled).

    <p num="138">
      In the case where the pathologically proliferating cells are proliferating cells that would cause restenosis, the manipulator(s) of nitrosative stress that is (are) administered to inhibit the proliferation of the pathologically proliferating cells is (are) (i) manipulator of nitrosative stress that inhibits protection against nitrosative stress or (ii) manipulator of nitrosative stress that is agent that increases nitrosative stress employed concurrently with a manipulator of nitrosative stress that inhibits protection against nitrosative stress or (iii) manipulator of nitrosative stress that both increases nitrosative stress and inhibits protection against nitrosative stress.
      <br/>
      Selectivity is obtained by associating the one manipulator of nitrosative stress that is employed or at least one of a plurality of manipulators of nitrosative stress that are employed with a stent implanted during angioplasty.
      <br/>
      For example, manipulator(s) of nitrosative stress is (are) attached to a polymeric stent via an ester linkage to polymer of the stent or is (are) associated with a porous polymer coated on a stent whereby manipulator(s) of nitrosative stress leach(es) out of the porous polymer and contact(s) the pathologically proliferating cells.
      <br/>
      The manipulator(s) of nitrosative stress used in association with a polymeric stent or with polymer coated on a stent is (are) employed in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 10% by weight of the polymer.
      <br/>
      Suitable manipulators of nitrosative stress that inhibit protection against nitrosative stress for (i) include, for example, agents which inhibit the synthesis of glutathione or deplete glutathione non-selectively when not locally delivered, e.g., L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine, diethyl maleate or melphalan.
      <br/>
      Suitable manipulators of nitrosative stress that increase nitrosative stress for (ii) include, for example, S-nitrosocysteine, nitroglycerine, amyl nitrite and S-nitrosopolythiodextran.
      <br/>
      Suitable manipulators of nitrosative stress that inhibit protection against nitrosative stress for (ii) include, for example, melphalan, and thiol synthesis inhibiting agents, e.g., L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine.
      <br/>
      In one alternative for (ii), both kinds of manipulators of nitrosative stress are administered from a stent.
      <br/>
      In other alternatives for (ii), L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine is administered from a stent and agent that increases nitrosative stress is administered systemically, e.g., intravenously, or by intracoronary infusion or agent that increases nitrosative stress is administered from a stent or by intracoronary infusion and L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine is administered systemically.
      <br/>
      Where L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine is administered systemically, it is preferably used in a dosage ranging from 1 mmol to 100 mmol per kg mammalian body weight per day and administration is preferably by oral administration.
      <br/>
      Where agent that increases nitrosative stress (e.g., S-nitrosocysteine or S-nitrosopolythiodextran) is administered systemically, it is preferably used in a dosage ranging from 0.1  MU g to 100 mg per kg mammalian body weight per day and administration is preferably by oral or intravenous administration.
      <br/>
      Suitable manipulator of nitrosative stress for (iii) is NO-substituted L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine, preferably administered from a stent where it is present in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 10% by weight of the polymer of the stent and the rate of drug release is such that therapy continues for 1 to 20 days or longer.
      <br/>
      The treatments are optionally used in combination with intravascular beta-, gamma- or X-ray irradiation.
      <br/>
      Methods for applying beta- and gamma-irradiation for this purpose are described hereinbefore.

    <p num="139">
      In cases where the pathologically proliferating cells are the cells causing benign prostatic hypertrophy, selectivity can be obtained by associating the manipulator(s) of nitrosative stress with an implant which is inserted into the affected prostate.
      <br/>
      The manipulator of nitrosative stress can be one that increases nitrosative stress or the manipulator of nitrosative stress can be one that inhibits protection against nitrosative stress, e.g., L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the two types of manipulators of nitrosative stress are used together.
      <br/>
      Where two kinds of manipulators of nitrosative stress are utilized, only one kind need be selective, so only one kind may be attached to the implant and the other kind may be non-selective and administered systemically or both kinds can be administered from the implant.
      <br/>
      The implant is preferably a polymer pellet as described hereinbefore and the associated agent is present in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 10% by weight of the polymer in the pellet and rate of drug release is such that therapy continues for 1 to 20 days or longer after the pellet is emplaced.
      <br/>
      Selective application can also be obtained by systemic administration of glutathione synthesis inhibiting agent or glutathione depleting agent, in dosages ranging from 1 mmol/kg to 100 mmol/kg of mammalian body weight per day and/or nitrosating agent in dosages ranging from 1 mg to 1 g/kg body weight per day, with co-administration of drug that does not manipulate nitrosative stress that inhibits benign prostatic hypertrophy, e.g., phenoxybenzamine, alfuzosin, prazosin, tetrazosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin and finasteride in the dosages and with the routes of administration used for this purpose.
      <br/>
      Selective application can also be obtained by systemic administration of NO-substituted drug that otherwise does not manipulate nitrosative stress that inhibits benign prostatic hypertrophy.
      <br/>
      The same general procedures as described above for derivatizing antibiotics and antivirals can be used to obtain the NO-substitution.
      <br/>
      For example, thiol group or hydroxyl group is generated if not already present, and thiol or hydroxyl moieties are converted to S-nitrosothiols or nitrate or nitrite esters by well-known procedures.
      <br/>
      An examples of an NO-substituted benign prostatic hypertrophy drug is NO-substituted finasteride (e.g., as the NONOate).
      <br/>
      Dosage is preferably the same as for the same benign prostatic hypertrophy drug except that in cases where the NO-substitution reduces the inherent efficacy of the benign prostatic hypertrophy drug, the NO-substituted drug is administered in a higher dose so as to attain or exceed the original benign prostatic hypertrophy ameliorating efficacy.
      <br/>
      The route of administration for the NO-substituted drug is preferably the same as for the same drug without NO-substitution.

      In all the cases described above except where otherwise specifically stated, two kinds of manipulators of nitrosative stress in the pathologic microbes or in the host cells infected with said microbes or in the pathologic helminths or in the pathologically proliferating mammalian cells can be employed where one kind is an inhibitor of protection against nitrosative stress and the other kind is an agent that increases nitrosative stress in the microbes, host cells, helminths or pathologically proliferating mammalian cells, and either the inhibition of protection against nitrosative stress or the increasing of nitrosative stress or both are selective in said microbes, host cells, helminths and proliferating mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      Examples of selective agents are described hereinbefore.
      <br/>
      Examples of the non-selective agents are L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine and ethacrynic acid (a thiol depleter) administered systemically, e.g., via oral or intravenous routes of administration, at a dosage of 0.1  MU g to 100 mg/kg body weight per day.
      <br/>
      In a preferred execution, a single agent is used which is both an inhibitor of protection against nitrosative stress and an increaser of nitrosative stress in the pathologic microbes or in host cells infected with pathologic microbes or in the pathologic helminths or in the pathologically proliferating mammalian cells.

      Another embodiment herein is directed to treating microbial infections of the oral cavity in a mammal comprising topically administering to the site of the infection an infection reducing effective amount of a manipulator of nitrosative stress which increases nitrosative stress in microbes causing the microbial infection, especially S-nitrosothiols.
      <br/>
      This method is important especially for immunocompromised patients, e.g., for treating oral candidiasis.
      <br/>
      Examples of S-nitrosothiols for this embodiment include S-nitrosoglutathione, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, S-nitroso-gamma-methyl-L-homocysteine, S-nitroso-L-homocysteine and S-nitroso- DELTA -thio-L-leucine.
      <br/>
      The S-nitrosothiols are utilized at concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM to 1 M, e.g., in solution in water or saline and are preferably applied as an oral rinse.
      <br/>
      For example, a suitable treatment regimen is for the patient to orally swish 5 ml of a 100 mM S-nitrosothiol solution for a 1 to 5 minute time period and then to spit it out, four times a day, for as long as improvement is obtained.

      The skin lesions to which this method applies include, for example, those of athlete's foot fungal infections, herpetic lesions, and infected skin ulcers.
      <br/>
      The S-nitrosothiols can be those described in the above paragraph used at concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM to 1 M. The S-nitrosothiols can also be formed in situ, e.g., by applying a mixture of inorganic nitrite salt (e.g., sodium nitrite), pharmaceutically acceptable acid (e.g., salicylic acid or citric acid), and thiol (e.g., cysteine), in proportions suitable for forming an S-nitrosothiol.
      <br/>
      For this method, the S-nitrosothiol or mixture for forming an S-nitrosothiol is readily formulated into a composition for topical application, for example, an ointment or cream, by admixture with inactive ingredients that are conventional for compositions for topical application.

      Examples of pathologic conditions associated with protozoa that can be treated in this embodiment are those listed hereinbefore.

      <br/>
      NO-substituted drugs include drugs in which pre-existing hydroxyl groups are modified to nitrite or nitrate esters, pre-existing sulfhydryl groups are modified to S-nitrosothiols, or pre-existing secondary amino groups are modified to NONOates.

      <br/>
      The pathologic microbes, pathologic helminths, and pathologically proliferating mammalian cells are those described above.
      <br/>
      The manipulators of nitrosative stress are those described above in conjunction with other embodiments and these may be used with the dosages and routes of administration described above.
      <br/>
      The agents which increase oxidative stress in said microbes, host cells, helminths, and pathologically proliferating mammalian cells can be, for example, redox cycling drugs (e.g., doxorubicin), organic peroxides, immune system stimulants causing a respiratory burst and 100% oxygen administered in a hyperbaric chamber and the dosages and routes of administration used for these are those established for the use of these agents for other purposes.
      <br/>
      The same agent can be used as a manipulator of nitrosative stress and to increase oxidative stress.
      <br/>
      An example of this in the treatment of a human patient with pathologically proliferating cancer cells is doxorubicin derivatized to release and transfer NO+, NO- or NO2+ group described above, used with dosages and routes of administration described above.

    <p num="146">
      The function of administration of manipulators and/or agents herein to enhance the susceptibility of microbes and helminths and pathologically proliferating mammalian cells to innate immune defenses is recited herein.
      <br/>
      It is now appreciated that cells of the immune system (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils, etc.) employ a variety of mechanisms to kill. microbes or helminths or pathologically proliferating mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      In some cases the pathologic cell, typically a microbe, is phagocytized by the cell of the immune system and is attacked inside a vesicle within the immune cell, and in other cases the immune cell attacks the pathologic cell without first phagocytizing it.
      <br/>
      In either case, two important components of the immune cell cytostatic or cytotoxic response to the pathologic cell are the production of oxidative stress agents (e.g., superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, peroxynitrite) and nitrosative stress agents (e.g., S-nitrosothiols, N2 O3, etc.).
      <br/>
      Pathologic microbes and pathologic helminths and pathologically proliferating mammalian cells have defenses against both oxidative and nitrosative stress and among these defenses are endogenous thiols which reduce oxidative stress agents or react with nitrosative stress agents to form less cytotoxic species, export pumps in the plasma membrane which remove, for example, S-nitrosoglutathione from the cells thereby reducing the potential toxicity of that species to the cells, and various enzymes which degrade oxidative stress agents (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, etc.) or nitrosative stress agents (e.g., the thioredoxin system degrades S-nitrosoglutathione, etc.).
      <br/>
      Consequently, thiol depletion or inhibition of these enzymes increases the susceptibility of pathologic microbes or pathologic helminths or pathologically proliferating mammalian cells to oxidative and nitrosative stress provided by the immune system of the host organism.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      The function of administration of manipulators and/or agents herein to enhance the susceptibility of microbes to antimicrobial agents is mentioned herein.
      <br/>
      This is important because certain strains of bacteria have developed which are resistant to antimicrobial agents, e.g., drug resistant staphylococci, streptococci, E. coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
      <br/>
      The invention herein can make these antimicrobial resistant bacteria susceptible to antimicrobial agents including antibiotics.

      Another embodiment herein is directed to a method for inhibiting growth of pathologic bacteria in a mammal, said method comprising administering to said mammal a pathologic bacteria antiproliferative effective amount of a chelating agent and of an agent that increases nitrosative stress.
      <br/>
      Metal ions, principally copper and iron, catalyze the breakdown of S-nitrosothiols, a major category of nitrosative stress agents, in vivo.
      <br/>
      Agents chelating copper or iron decrease the ability of microorganisms to destroy S-nitrosothiols and thereby avoid the toxicity of S-nitrosothiols.
      <br/>
      Suitable chelating agents for use in this embodiment are those that bind copper and/or iron and include, for example, penicillamine (a copper chelator) administered orally in a dose ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 g/day in four divided doses; trientine (a copper chelator) administered orally in a dose ranging from 0.5 to 2 g/day in divided doses two, three or four times daily; and deferoxamine (an iron chelator) administered subcutaneously in a dose ranging from 0.1 to 2 g/day.

      The agents in this embodiment that increase nitrosative stress include the manipulators of nitrosative stress for selectively increasing nitrosative stress in microbes described above, and routes of administration described above for these apply in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      The agent that increases nitrosative stress in this embodiment can also be one that by itself is non-selective since the combination of manipulator of nitrosative stress and chelating agent provides selective application since microbes are more sensitive to this combination than normal mammalian cells.

      Non-selective agents for increasing nitrosative stress and dosages and routes of administration for systemic delivery are described above.

      The bacteria to which this embodiment applies include those listed above.

      Still another embodiment herein is directed at a method of inhibiting growth of pathologic microbes or pathologic helminths or pathologically proliferating mammalian cells, in a mammal, said method comprising administering to said mammal a therapeutic pathologic microbe or pathologic helminth or pathologically proliferating mammalian cell antiproliferative effective amount of a manipulator of nitrosative stress comprising agent functional to convert endogenously produced NO to NO- or NO+ (including species with NO+ activity which are nitric-oxide related compounds).
      <br/>
      The pathologic microbes, pathologic helminths and pathologically proliferating mammalian cells are those described above.
      <br/>
      Example of agent that is functional to convert endogenously produced NO to NO- or NO+ is redox active metal catalyst, especially chelates of iron which are known to be redox active metal catalysts.
      <br/>
      An example of a redox active metal catalyst that is functional to convert endogenously produced NO to NO- is ferrioxamine B complex which is referred to as �Fe(III)(HDFB)�+ and as a stable and efficient electrocatalyst for the reduction of NO to NO2 at biologically relevant potentials in Kazmierski, W. M., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 93, pp 9138-9141 (8/1996).
      <br/>
      The disclosure of Kazmierski, et al., is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Redox active metal catalysts functional to convert NO to NO+ are described in Stamler, J., et al., Science, Vol. 258, 1898-1902 (1992), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Redox active catalysts functional to convert NO to species with NO+ activity are heme complexes including myoglobin and hemoglobin.
      <br/>
      The redox active metal catalysis are used with dosages of 10  MU g to 100 mg/kg body weight per day and administration is preferably via oral or intravenous routes.
      <br/>
      Preferably cytokines are also administered which induce iNOS to cause increase of endogenous NO production resulting in higher levels of nitrosative stress because of greater efficiency of conversion to nitrosative stress species because of the greater amount of NO being produced.
      <br/>
      Cytokines useful in this embodiment to induce iNOS to cause increased endogenous NO production include interleukin-1, interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor.
      <br/>
      Dosages for the cytokines are 1  MU g to 10 mg/kg body weight per day for 1 to 10 days and route of administration is intravenous.

      Still another embodiment herein is directed to a method for inhibiting growth of pathologically proliferating mammalian cells or for killing or inhibiting growth of mammalian host cells containing pathologic microbes (i.e., mammalian cells with viruses or microbes that are living inside the mammalian cells), in a mammal, comprising administering to said mammal a pathologic microbe or a pathologically proliferating mammalian cell antiproliferative effective amount of a blocker of the ability of the cells to export nitrosant and an agent that increases nitrosative stress.
      <br/>
      In explanation, mammalian cells defend themselves against nitrosants using their endogenous glutathione.
      <br/>
      Nitrosant reacts with glutathione to form S-nitrosoglutathione and therefore is not available to nitrosate more critical structures such as proteins or nucleic acids. S-Nitrosoglutathione itself might cause some toxicity, but cells have developed export pumps which they use to transport S-nitrosoglutathione (as well as other S-substituted glutathiones) out of the cell into the extracellular environment.
      <br/>
      Once such agents are outside the cell, they are carried away with the extracellular fluid and are much less likely to damage the cell from which they were exported.
      <br/>
      To summarize, a highly reactive nitrosant such as N2 O3 or S-nitrosocysteine can react with glutathione to form S-nitrosoglutathione which is itself less reactive than the original species and which in addition is subject to selective export from the cell eliminating its toxicity to the cell.
      <br/>
      Blocking the export, as is the case in this embodiment, keeps the S-nitrosoglutathione and other nitrosated products in the cell where their toxicity is applied to the cell.
      <br/>
      Increasing nitrosative stress in the cell causes an increased amount of nitrosated products in the cell where their toxicity is applied to the cell.
      <br/>
      We turn now to the pathologic microbes; these are the same as those described above.
      <br/>
      We turn now to the pathologically proliferating mammalian cells; these are the same as the pathologically proliferating cells described above, and include, for example, pathologically proliferating cancer cells, the pathologically proliferating or enlarging cells that would cause restenosis and the pathologically proliferating or enlarging cells causing benign prostatic hypertrophy.
      <br/>
      We turn now to the blockers of the ability of the cells to export nitrosant.
      <br/>
      The blocker is preferably a substrate for P-glycoprotein or an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.
      <br/>
      Inhibitors of P-glycoprotein include, for example, verapamil, cyclosporin, S9788, MK571 and stable S-substituted derivatives of glutathione, e.g., the 2,4-dinitrophenyl derivatives of glutathione (e.g., dinitrophenacyl glutathione).
      <br/>
      Other blockers are derivatives of glutathione in which the thiol moiety of glutathione is covalently substituted with alkyl, aryl or aralkyl where the glycyl carboxylate or both the glycyl and  ALPHA -glutamyl carboxylate are esterified (e.g., with ethanol).
      <br/>
      Preferably the blocker is administered locally or is otherwise administered so as to be selective for the host cells or for the pathologically proliferating mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      The antiproliferative effective amount (dosage) of the blocker may range from 0.1  MU g to 100 mg per kg of mammal body weight and the route of administration for it is topical or intravenous or oral.
      <br/>
      The agents in this embodiment that increase nitrosative stress can be the same as the manipulators of nitrosative stress administered to selectively increase nitrosative stress described above and the dosages and routes of administration described above for these apply in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      The agent that increases nitrosative stress in this embodiment can also be one that, on administration, is non-selective for host cells and pathologically proliferating mammalian cells, for example, NO-substituted verapamil (produced, for example, by replacing the methyl group in the isopropyl moiety of verpamil with --SNO or by removing the N-methyl group of verapamil and using the resulting dialkylamine as the basis for forming a NONOate which will release NO for partial conversion to nitrosant) or S-nitroso-N-acetylpencillamine administered intravenously or nitroglycerin administered orally, in a dosage of 10  MU g to 100 mg/kg mammalian body weight per day.
      <br/>
      In the case of NO-substituted verpamil, a single agent functions as a blocker of the ability of the cells to export nitrosant and as agent which increases nitrosative stress.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      In those embodiments herein where a manipulator of nitrosative stress that is nitrosant or NONOate is administered systemically, a hypotensive response can occur.
      <br/>
      Sometimes there is an adaptive response where the agent continues to cause nitrosative stress but not cause hypotension after 24-48 hours, e.g., in the case where organic nitrates are administered.
      <br/>
      The hypotension occurs because nitric oxide activates the soluble isoform of guanylyl cyclase which forms cyclic GMP (cGMP) which causes alterations in cellular calcium levels that eventually cause smooth muscle relaxation and hypotension.
      <br/>
      In those cases where a hypotensive response occurs, especially where there will be no adaptive response, the hypotensive response is prevented by administration of an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase, e.g., methylene blue, LY83583 which is 6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione, or OQD which is 1H-�1,2,4�oxadiazole�4,3-a�quinoxalin-1-one.
      <br/>
      Thus, an embodiment herein is directed to a method of inhibiting growth of pathologic microbes or pathologic helminths or pathologically proliferating mammalian cells, in a mammal, comprising systemically administering to said mammal a pathologic microbe or pathologic helminth or pathologically proliferating mammalian cell antiproliferative effective amount of agent that increases nitrosative stress in said microbes or in host cells infected with said microbes or in said helminths or in said pathologically proliferating cells whereby nitrosative stress selectively kills or reduces the growth of said microbes or host cells or helminths or pathologically proliferating mammalian cells or selectively enhances their susceptibility to innate immune defenses or the susceptibility of said microbes to antimicrobial agents (which function by a mechanism other than by manipulating nitrosative stress) or the susceptibility of said helminths to anthelmintic agents (which function by a mechanism other than by manipulating nitrosative stress) or the susceptibility of the pathologically proliferating cells to antiproliferative agents (which function by a mechanism other than by manipulating nitrosative stress), and also administering to said mammal a hypotensive response preventing amount of an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase, e.g., at a dosage ranging from 10  MU g to 100 mg/kg body weight via intravenous or oral route of administration.

      We turn now to the method herein of inhibiting growth of non-viral pathologic microbes in a mammal, said method comprising administering to said mammal a pathologic microbe antiprolif erative ef fective amount of a selective inhibitor of thiol synthesis in the microbe to mediate selective killing or growth reduction of the microbe by agent which is selected from the group consisting of antimicrobials, immune cells in the mammal and products of mammalian antimicrobial response.
      <br/>
      The selective inhibitors of thiol synthesis are the same as those described above as manipulators of nitrosative stress which are selective inhibitors of thiol synthesis in microbes and the antiproliferative effective amounts for this embodiment are the same as the dosages described above for manipulators of nitrosative stress which are selective inhibitors of thiol synthesis in microbes and the routes of administration are the same as those described above in conjunction with manipulators of nitrosative stress which are selective inhibitors of thiol synthesis in microbes.
      <br/>
      Where the microbes are glutathione-producing microbes, the selective inhibitors of thiol synthesis are preferably  ALPHA -alkyl-S-alkyl-homocysteine sulfoximines, e.g.,  ALPHA -alkyl-S-alkyl-DL-homocysteine-RS-sulfoximines or the L,S-diastereomers, where the  ALPHA -alkyl contains 2 to 8 carbon atoms and the S-alkyl contains 1 to 10 carbon atoms, very preferably where the  ALPHA -alkyl is ethyl and/or the S-alkyl is butyl, e.g.,  ALPHA -ethyl-L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine, with the dosages and routes of administration described above for these applying here.
      <br/>
      The antimicrobials are those having antimicrobial effect on the infecting microbe and include, for example, chloramphenicol for the treatment of E. coli caused septicemia and isoniazid and rifampin for the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis caused tuberculosis.
      <br/>
      The immune cells in the mammal include, for example, macrophages and neutrophils.
      <br/>
      The products of mammalian antimicrobial response include, for example, S-nitrosothiols and N2 O3 and oxidative stress agents, for example, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and hypochlorous acid.

      We turn now to the method herein for inhibiting the growth of pathologic viruses in a mammal (including a human), said method comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutic amount of a non-selective inhibitor of glutathione synthesis or depleter of glutathione which causes depletion of glutathione in the host cells for the virus and thereby sensitizes the virus to selective killing by antiviral agent, immune cells in the mammal and products of the mammalian antiviral response.
      <br/>
      Viral infections treated by this method include, for example, those mentioned hereinfore in reference to pathologic viruses and include, for example, infections caused by human immunodeficiency virus (AIDS, Kaposi's sarcoma), herpes virus (herpetic infections), cytomegalovirus (pneumonia, CMV mononucleosis), Epstein Barr virus (infectious mononucleosis, Burkitt's lymphoma), hepatitis viruses A, B and C (hepatitis), and rotavirus (viral gastroenteritis).
      <br/>
      In its broadest aspect, this method comprises administering to the mammal a non-selective inhibitor of glutathione synthesis or depleter of glutathione which depletes glutathione in the host cells for the virus.
      <br/>
      Examples of non-selective inhibitors of glutathione synthesis and depleters of glutathione are L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine, ethacrynic acid, L-prothionine-S-sulfoximine, L-penthathionine-S-sulfoximine, and diethyl maleate; these are administered systemically, e.g., via oral or intravenous routes of administration, at a dosage of 0.1  MU g to 100 mg/kg body weight per day.
      <br/>
      The non-selective inhibitors of glutathione synthesis or depleters of glutathione are preferably administered in conjunction with antiviral agent.
      <br/>
      The antiviral agents are those used for the viral infection being treated used in those doses and with the routes of administration for the antiviral agent and include zidovudine, acyclovir, penciclovir, famciclovir, interferon- ALPHA , interferon- BETA , and interferon-gamma.

      We turn now to the method herein comprising treating a mammal, e.g., a human, for those disorders now being treated with hydroxyurea with a therapeutic amount of a non-selective inhibitor of glutathione synthesis or depleter of glutathione used in conjunction with the hydroxyurea.
      <br/>
      The disorders now being treated with hydroxyurea include myeloproliferative disorders (including chronic granulocytic leukemia, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocytosis), malignant melanoma, and carcinomas of the head, neck and genitourinary systems, and psoriasis.
      <br/>
      The inhibitor of glutathione synthesis or depleter of glutathione is administered to decrease defenses against nitrosative stress.
      <br/>
      The hydroxyurea is converted to nitric-oxide related compounds in vivo and therefore causes nitrosative stress.
      <br/>
      Examples of inhibitors of glutathione synthesis and depleters of glutathione for this embodiment are L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine, ethacrynic acid, L-prothionine-s-sulfoximine, L-pentathionine-S-sulfoximine, and diethyl maleate; these are administered systemically, e.g., via oral or intravenous routes, in a therapeutic amount, e.g., at a dosage of 0.1  MU g to 100 mg/kg body weight per day.
      <br/>
      The hydroxyurea is administered in the dosages and with the routes of administration used for the disorder being treated.
      <br/>
      In general, the dosage for hydroxyurea normally ranges from 20 to 80 mg/kg body weight, e.g., 80 mg/kg administered orally as a single dose every third day or 20-30 mg/kg administered orally as a single daily dose.

    <p num="157">We turn now to the invention herein related to treating patients in need of increased nitrosative stress defenses.</p>
    <p num="158">
      One kind of patient in need of increased nitrosative stress defenses, is a patient who has had a transient ischemic attack.
      <br/>
      Transient ischemic attacks are defined in The Merck Manual, 16th edition, as "Focal neurologic abnormalities of sudden onset and brief duration (usually minutes, never more than a few hours) that reflect dysfunction in the distribution of either the internal carotid-middle cerebral or the vertebral-vascular arterial system." In some patients, transient ischemic attacks occur shortly before a stroke.
      <br/>
      In other patients who have had one or more transient ischemic attacks, stroke eventually occurs; this scenario is more prevalent in those patients with carotid artery involvement.
      <br/>
      There is now evidence that nitrosative stress can contribute importantly to the tissue damage and disability of cerebral stroke.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      One embodiment herein is directed to prophylactically treating those patients who have had one or more transient ischemic attacks or a prior stroke so as to protect neuronal cells from death in the event a stroke later occurs in such a patient.
      <br/>
      This embodiment is directed to a method of treating a patient at risk for a cerebral stroke because of having had one or more transient ischemic attacks or a prior stroke, said method comprising administering to said patient a nitrosative stress defense mechanism upregulating amount of manipulator of nitrosative stress in the patient thereby to cause protection of neuronal cells in the patient from death from nitrosative stress occurring in the patient in the event a cerebral stroke occurs in the patient.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      A method for causing upregulation of nitrosative stress defense mechanism in patients needing such including those who have had one or more transient ischemic attacks or a prior stroke comprises the administration to such a patient of a nitrosative stress tolerance increasing amount of a manipulator of nitrosative stress.
      <br/>
      Thus, an embodiment herein is directed to a method of treating a patient in need of increased nitrosative stress defenses, e.g., a patient who is at risk for a stroke because of having had one or more transient ischemic attacks or who has had one or more strokes and is therefore at risk for another stroke, and comprises administering to said patient a nitrosative stress tolerance increasing amount of a manipulator of nitrosative stress thereby to cause increase of nitrosative stress defense mechanism in the patient.
      <br/>
      The manipulator of nitrosative stress for this embodiment can be one that imposes a nitrosative stress or one that is metabolized in the body to one that imposes nitrosative stress or agent that is one that inhibits protection against nitrosative stress, which is administered repeatedly, usually at low doses, to cause an increase in tolerance to nitrosative stress, i.e., to cause a tolerance enhancing response of upregulating nitrosative defense mechanism, in the patient.
      <br/>
      The method herein can be effected for example, by administering, preferably nasally, low concentrations (e.g., 1 to 10 ppm in air) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), dinitrogen trioxide (N2 O3) or dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) for 0.1 to 4 hours for 1 to 30 days or at concentrations of 1 to 2 ppm for 0.1 to 1 hour indefinitely.
      <br/>
      Other specific methods of upregulating nitrosative stress defense mechanism in a patient include administering nitroglycerin, e.g., orally, at a dose ranging from 3 to 13 mg, four times a day, for three days to three weeks, or via sublingual administration at a dose ranging from 0.15 to 0.6 mg up to 10 times per day or at least 50 times a week, for one week; administering S-nitrosocysteine, intravenously, intranasally or orally, at a dose of 0.1 mg to 10 mg, six times per day for three days to three weeks; administering a redox cycling drug; i.e., a drug which is reduced by enzymes using NADPH or NADH, to a species that reacts spontaneously with O2 to give superoxide, e.g., doxorubicin or menadione, at a dosage which is 1 to 100% of that used for the drug for its known therapeutic usage, daily, for up to four days via the route of administration used for the drug; administering hyperbaric oxygen, i.e., 100% O2 (containing up to 100 ppm NO) at 1 to 3 atmospheres, two or three times per day for 30 minutes, repeating for up to 10 days; administering amyloid peptide, e.g., amino acids 1-40 of amyloid protein or any of those described in established literature, at doses of 1  MU g to 100, daily, or at least three times a week, for at least two weeks, via intravenous route of administration; or administering L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine (LBSO) or its ethyl ester, preferably orally for LBSO and intravascularly for the ester, at a dose ranging from 1 to 10 mmol/kg, daily or at least two times a week, for at least 10 weeks.
    </p>
    <p num="161">Other patients in need of upregulation of nitrosative stress defenses besides those at risk for a cerebral stroke include, for example, those with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and AIDS dementia; and those undergoing surgical procedures that might cause temporary reduction of blood flow to the brain.</p>

    <p num="163">Inhibition of E. coli Gamma-Glutamylcysteine Synthetase by BSO Analogs</p>
    <p num="164">
      It has been known since the 1970's that methionine sulfoximine potently inhibits glutamine synthetase and gamma-glutamylcysteinyl synthetase (gamma-GCS) in mammalian systems.
      <br/>
      In 1978, O. W. Griffith and A. Meister reported that selective inhibition of either glutamine synthetase or gamma-GCS could be achieved using analogs of methionine sulfoximine.
      <br/>
      Thus, glutamine synthetase was inhibited by  ALPHA -ethyl-DL-methionine-SR-sulfoximine, a compound which did not significantly inhibit gamma-GCS, and gamma-GCS was inhibited by DL-prothionine-SR-sulfoximine, a compound which did not significantly inhibit glutamine synthetase.
      <br/>
      Griffith, O. W., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 253, 2333-2338 (1978) and Griffith, O. W., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 254, 1205-1210 (1979).
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 in the second mentioned reference shows schematically the basis of this selectivity.
      <br/>
      As shown, the glutamate binding site of glutamine synthetase can accommodate  ALPHA -alkyl substituents as large as ethyl, whereas the glutamate binding site of gamma-GCS cannot accommodate such substituents.
      <br/>
      Correspondingly, the binding site region occupied by S-alkyl substituents of homocysteine sulfoximine inhibitors is small in glutamine synthetase and much larger in gamma-GCS.
      <br/>
      Subsequent studies established that mammalian gamma-GCS is most effectively inhibited by L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine (BSO).
      <br/>
      Bacterial gamma-GCS, exemplified by the E. coli enzyme, catalyzes the same reaction as mammalian gamma-GCS, but the enzymes are essentially unrelated in terms of their protein structure and amino acid sequence.
      <br/>
      The possibility was therefore considered that homocysteine sulfoximine derivatives could be discovered that selectively inhibited E. coli gamma-GCS without inhibiting the mammalian enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      E. coli gamma-GCS was isolated from bacterial cells engineered to overexpress the enzyme; the isolation procedure was similar to that used previously to isolate mammalian gamma-GCS.
      <br/>
      The enzyme obtained was pure by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of denaturants (SDS-PAGE) and had a specific activity of .about.1,100 units/mg.
      <br/>
      The enzyme was assayed in reaction mixtures (final volume=1.0 ml) containing: 150 mM Tris*HCl, pH 8.2, 100 mM KCl, 25 mM MgCl2, 7.5 mM ATP, 7.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.3 mM EDTA, 10 mM L-glutamate, 10 mM L- ALPHA -aminobutyrate (an L-cysteine analog), 0.3 mM NADH, 5 IU pyruvate kinase, and 5 IU lactate dehydrogenase.
      <br/>
      Reaction was initiated by adding gamma-GCS; in control studies, L- ALPHA -aminobutyrate was omitted from the reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      In this assay, pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are added in excess to detect formation of ADP, one of the products of the gamma-GCS reaction.
      <br/>
      The relevant enzyme reactions are shown as equations 1-3 below.
      <br/>
      Oxidation of NADH to NAD+ is followed and quantitated spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (1  MU mol oxidation gives  DELTA OD=-6.2) and is directly proportional to product formation by gamma-GCS.  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="166">
      Inhibition by homocysteine sulfoximines was carried out by preincubating the E. coli gamma-GCS with potential inhibitors in the presence of ATP and then removing aliquots of that mixture at specific times and assaying for residual activity using the assay procedure described above.
      <br/>
      The preincubation reaction mixtures contained (final volume=400  MU l) the following: 210 mM Tris*HCl, pH 8.2, 142 mM KCl, 36 mM MgCl2, 10 mM ATP, 0.4 mM EDTA, various amounts of sulfoximine, and gamma-GCS.
      <br/>
      At intervals, 50  MU l aliquots were removed and added to 1.0 ml assay reaction mixtures to determine residual activity spectrophotometrically.
      <br/>
      Results of a study indicate that E. coli gamma-GCS loses about 27% of its activity over 30 minutes in the absence of added inhibitors; this loss of activity represents an inherent instability in the enzyme when incubated under these reaction conditions in this particular experiment.
      <br/>
      Inclusion of 100  MU M L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine (L-BSO) results in 89% inactivation in 10 min and virtually complete inactivation in 30 min.
      <br/>
      A similar level of inactivation was achieved with 2 mM with  ALPHA -ethyl-DL-buthionine-SR-sulfoximine (DL-SR- ALPHA -ethyl-BSO), synthesized by the method described in Griffith, O. W., Methods in Enzymology, 143, 286-291 (1987) for synthesizing DL- ALPHA -ethylmethionine-SR-sulfoximine except 45.1 g (0.5 mole, approximately 53.6 ml) of 1-butanethiol was used in place of methanethiol. (Analytical date on the synthesized compound is given above; the synthesized compound was greater than 95% pure by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using the HPLC procedure with solvent system described in Griffith, O. W., et al., Methods in Enzymology, 143, 166-172, (1987)).
      <br/>
      This preparation contains 4 isomers of  ALPHA -ethyl-BSO, but only the L-S isomer is active as an enzyme inhibitor.
      <br/>
      The concentration of  ALPHA -ethyl-L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine is .about.1/4 of the total concentration or .about.500  MU M. Therefore, the experiment shows that on an active isomer basis  ALPHA -ethyl-BSO is about 20% as effective an inhibitor of E. coli gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase as is L-S-BSO.
      <br/>
      Note that  ALPHA -ethyl-BSO will not inhibit glutamine synthetase because its S-alkyl substituent is too large to bind to that enzyme (see said FIG. 5 mentioned above).
      <br/>
      In separate studies,  ALPHA -ethyl-DL-buthionine-SR-sulfoximine was compared to L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine as an inhibitor of mammalian gamma-GCS.
      <br/>
      Using highly purified rat kidney gamma-GCS and a protocol similar to that described here for the E. coli enzyme, it was found that  ALPHA -ethyl-DL-buthionine-SR-sulfoximine was 0.025% as effective as L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine as an inhibitor of the mammalian enzyme.
      <br/>
      Expressed on the basis of the active isomer,  ALPHA -ethyl-L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine,  ALPHA -ethyl-BSO has about 0.1% the inhibitory activity of L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine with mammalian enzyme.

    <p num="167">Proof That Nitrosating Agent Causes Reduction in Bacterial Growth and That Pretreatment With Nitrosating Agent Induces Resistance to Later Treatment With Nitrosating Agent</p>
    <p num="168">
      In a first experiment, six runs were carried out.
      <br/>
      In three of the runs, wild type E. coli were incubated in bacterial growth medium.
      <br/>
      In the other three runs, E. coli lacking a gene essential for glutathione production (in particular, lacking a gene expressing gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, hereinafter glutathione deficient E. coli) were incubated in the bacterial growth medium.
      <br/>
      In one run, for each of the wild type E. coli and the glutathione deficient E. coli, no nitrosating agent was employed.
      <br/>
      In one run, for each of the wild type E. coli and the glutathione deficient E. coli, 0.5 mM S-nitrosocysteine (a nitrosating agent) was added after two hours.
      <br/>
      In one run, for each of the wild type E. coli and the glutathione deficient E. coli, 0.2 mM S-nitrosocysteine was added initially and 0.5 mM S-nitrosocysteine was added at the two hour mark.
      <br/>
      In each run, starting at the two hour mark and every 15 or 30 minutes thereafter, bacterial cell density (i.e., growth) was measured.
      <br/>
      The results are shown in FIG. 1 where cell density is plotted versus time (after two hours) and where O.D. 600 nm is a measure of bacterial cell growth, "wt" stands for wild type E. coli, " DELTA gsh" stands for glutathione deficient Reaction E. coli, a minus sign under "pre" means no pretreatment with 0.2 mM S-nitrosocysteine, a plus sign under "pre" means pretreatment with 0.2 mM S-nitrosocysteine, a minus sign under "post" means no post-treatment with 0.5 mM S-nitrosocysteine, a plus sign under "post" means post-treatment with 0.5 mM S-nitrosocysteine.
      <br/>
      Thus the circle data points are for wild type E. coli with no S-nitrosocysteine treatment; the X data points are for glutathione deficient E. coli with no S-nitrosocysteine treatment; the diamond data points are for wild type E. coli with treatment with both 0.2 mM S-nitrosocysteine and 0.5 mM S-nitrosocysteine.
      <br/>
      The triangle data points are for glutathione deficient E. coli with treatment with both 0.2 mM S-nitrosocysteine and 0.5 mM S-nitrosocysteine; the square data points are for wild type E. coli with no 0.2 mM S-nitrosocysteine treatment but with 0.5 mM S-nitrosocysteine treatment; and the plus sign data points are for glutathione deficient E. coli with no 0.2 mM S-nitrosocysteine treatment but with 0.5 mM S-nitrosocysteine treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      In a second experiment, six runs were carried out the same as in the first experiment.
      <br/>
      In this case, the results are shown in FIG. 2 where bacterial growth (measured as optical density (O.D.) 600 nm) is plotted on a log axis versus time (after two hours) and where "wt" and the plus and minus sign mean the same as in FIG. 1 and "gsh- " means glutathione deficient E. coli.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, the X data points are for wild type E. coli with no S-nitrosocysteine treatment; the plus sign data points are for glutathione deficient E. coli with no S-nitrosocysteine treatment; the square data points are for wild type E. coli with treatment with both 0.2 mM S-nitrosocysteine and with 0.5 mM S-nitrosocysteine; the triangle data points are for glutathione deficient E. coli with treatment with both 0.2 mM S-nitrosocysteine and with 0.5 mM S-nitrosocysteine; the circle data points are for wild type E. coli with no treatment with 0.2 mM S-nitrosocysteine but with treatment with 0.5 mM S-nitrosocysteine; and the diamond data points are for glutathione deficient E. coli with no treatment with 0.2 mM S-nitrosocysteine but with treatment with 0.5 mM S-nitrosocysteine.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, the open symbols (i.e., symbols which are not filled in, i.e., not solid) represent no growth.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, the use of a semilog scale provides linear rate of growth of curves, in the absence of treatment, i.e., depicts "log phase growth" as a straight line.
    </p>
    <p num="170">The results demonstrate that nitrosating agent reduces rate of bacterial growth, that there are two ways of inhibiting bacterial growth (delaying growth and causing failure to achieve maximal growth), that glutathione itself protects against nitrosative stress but is also involved in other protections against nitrosative stress (i.e., glutathione helps the organism induce resistance to nitrosative stress).</p>
    <p num="171">
      The same results were obtained when the experiment was carried out under anaerobic conditions.
      <br/>
      This indicates that nitrosative stress is involved and not oxidative stress.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the levels of reduced thiol were elevated in the experiments indicating that the cells continue to maintain reduced intracellular environment inconsistent with oxidative stress.
      <br/>
      In other words, in all the cells, thiol levels went up even through glutathione level was down, indicating oxidative stress is not involved.

      A recent CNN report described an explosion of a tanker containing the toxic nitrosant gases NO2 /N2 O4.
      <br/>
      The cloud of gas 12 remained in the area for several days, was blown away and then blown back several days later.
      <br/>
      Subjects in the area developed respiratory infections and cognitive and central nervous system deficits.
      <br/>
      However, workers in the N2 O4 plant who were exposed chronically to low doses of N2 O4 on a regular basis were found to be protected from the brain syndrome.
