      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to artificial lift production systems and methods deployed in subterranean oil and gas wells, and more particularly relates to artificial lift production systems and methods having submersible transducers allowing two fluids to be produced separately.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      An oil producing reservoir or zone in a well has a natural pressure.
      <br/>
      A well that produces oil or gas by its own pressure is a flowing well.
      <br/>
      Stated another way, a flowing well is a well that is not being produced by the employment of transducers, such as pumps, or other artificial means.
      <br/>
      The natural pressure may not be sufficient to force the production fluid to the surface during the later or even from the beginning stages of the life of the well.
      <br/>
      In such instances, secondary methods of extracting the production fluid to the surface may be required to supplement the reservoir drive.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One type of secondary method of extracting the production fluid is through the use of an electric submersible pump, commonly referred to as an ESP.
      <br/>
      The ESP is lowered into the well and an electrical cable extends from the wellhead to the ESP.
      <br/>
      The ESP pumps the production fluid to the surface and aids in maximizing production from a low pressure or non-flowing well.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In many instances, two or more separate producing zones exist in a single well bore.
      <br/>
      In many of these multiple zone wells, it is desirable to produce the production fluids P1 and P2 from zones Z1 and Z2, respectively, concurrently and without commingling.
      <br/>
      For example, P1 and P2 may be at different reservoir pressures.
      <br/>
      If P2 has a higher pressure than P1 and they are produced commingled, the flow rate of the lower pressure reservoir P1 will be reduced because of the higher pressure of the other reservoir P2.
      <br/>
      Another example would be where one formation includes a corrosive gas or a damaging fluid that should not be commingled with the other formation.
      <br/>
      The two production fluids may not be compatible with each other.
      <br/>
      Yet another reason for producing without commingling is that certain regulatory agencies consider separated zones to be different fields and the operator has to report the flow rates from each individual reservoir.
      <br/>
      If the production fluids P1 and P2 are commingled downhole the operator has no way of accurately reporting the separate flow rates.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      One option for producing two zones from a single well is for the operator to complete one zone for several years and then complete the second zone when the first zone is abandoned.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the operator could drill a separate well for the second zone as opposed to waiting for several years and taking the risk that the economic value of the well may be significantly lower at that point in time.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is desirable to produce concurrently without commingling from two zones within a single well bore.
      <br/>
      It is even more desirable to be able to use an artificial lift system to separately produce fluids from multiple zones within a single well bore.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In an artificial lift system having a transducer, such as a submersible pump, the work required in the transducer is a finction of the volume being pumped.
      <br/>
      If the produced fluid includes both liquid and gas, the current state of the art places a liquid/gas separator on the transducer to remove the gas and reduce the fluid volume to be pumped by the transducer.
      <br/>
      The use of the separator to remove the gas allows the transducer to work more efficiently.
      <br/>
      However, it is to be understood that once that transducer fails it can only be replaced by pulling the combined transducer and separator assembly out of the well.
      <br/>
      Similarly, if the liquid/gas separator fails, the separator can only be replaced by pulling the combined transducer and separator assembly out of the well.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in many reservoirs where large amounts of gas are found with the associated liquids, the current state of the art requires the use of natural gas separation, and then placing the transducer below the resulting fluid level.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is also desirable to be able to use an artificial lift system to produce a gas and liquid production fluid from a single zone separately as a gas and a degassed fluid.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="23">
      The first embodiment of the artificial lift, concentric tubing production system of the present invention, generally designated as reference 10, is shown in FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 1C.
      <br/>
      The artificial lift, concentric tubing production system 10, hereinafter referred to as "first system," is installed in a well bore or casing 12.
      <br/>
      The first system 10 is for use in a well in which it is desired to separately produce production fluids from upper and lower formations 14 (FIG. 1B) and 16 (FIG. 1C), respectively.
      <br/>
      The casing 12 includes perforations 12a and 12b at the elevations of the upper and lower formations 14 and 16, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring to FIG. 1A, the first system 10 includes an inner production tubing string 18 and an outer production tubing string 20 extending down from a wellhead (not shown).
      <br/>
      The inner production tubing string 18 has an inner tubing bore 18a and the outer production tubing string has an outer tubing bore 20a.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the inner production tubing string 18 is concentrically located within the outer production tubing string 20.
      <br/>
      Thus, the inner and outer production tubing strings 18 and 20, respectively, form a concentric tubing string 19.
      <br/>
      An annulus 20b is formed in the space between the inner and outer production tubing strings 18 and 20, respectively.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the outer production tubing string 20 has an outside diameter which is less than an inside diameter of the casing 12 as shown in FIG. 1A.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Still referring to FIG. 1A, a flow crossover assembly 22 is connected to a lower end 20c of the outer production tubing string 20.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 1A and 2, the flow crossover assembly 22 preferably includes inner and outer production pipes 24 and 26, respectively.
      <br/>
      The inner production pipe 24 has an inner pipe bore 24a and the outer production pipe 26 has an outer pipe bore 26a.
      <br/>
      An annulus 26b is formed in the space between the inner and outer production pipes 24 and 26, respectively.
      <br/>
      A transition or "Y"-tool member 28 is connected to the lower end of the inner and outer production pipes 24 and 26, respectively, of the flow crossover assembly 22.
      <br/>
      The "Y"-tool member 28 has an upper end 28a which is connected to the outer production pipe 26 and a lower end 28b having first and second passageways 28c and 28d, respectively, which are non-concentric but preferably parallel to one another.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the first system 10 as shown in FIGS. 1A-1C, an upper transducer 30, such as an electric submersible pump (ESP), is in fluid communication with the first passageway 28c, the inner pipe bore 24a, and the inner tubing bore 18a.
      <br/>
      A spool piece 32 fluidly connects the upper ESP 30 to the flow crossover assembly 22 as shown in FIG. 1A.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Referring to FIGS. 1B and 1C, a lower transducer 34, such as an ESP, is in fluid communication with the second passageway 28d, the crossover annulus 26b, and the tubing annulus 20b.
      <br/>
      A lower tubing section 36 fluidly connects the lower transducer or ESP 34 to the flow crossover assembly 22 as shown in FIG. 1A.
    </p>
    <p num="28">It is to be understood that the upper and lower transducers 30 and 34, respectively, are not limited to electric submersible pumps but also include other types of pumps including progressive cavity pumps.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Still referring to FIGS. 1B and 1C, the lower ESP 34 is preferably housed within a capsule 38 for reasons which will be explained below.
      <br/>
      The capsule 38 includes a lower opening 38a.
      <br/>
      A lower stinger 40 is connected to the capsule 38 around the lower opening 38a and extends through an opening in a packer 42.
      <br/>
      The packer 42 forms a seal with the casing 12 above the lower perforations 12b and sealingly engages the lower stinger 40.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The production fluid from the lower formation 16 below the packer 42 passes through the lower perforations 12b, the lower stinger 40, and the lower opening 38a into the capsule 38.
      <br/>
      The lower formation production fluid is transduced through the lower ESP 34 and conducted through the lower tubing section 36, the second passageway 28d, the crossover annulus 26b, and the tubing annulus 20b to the surface.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The production fluid from the upper formation 14 (FIG. 1B) above the packer 42 passes through the upper perforations 12a and is transduced through the upper ESP 30 and conducted through the spool piece 32, the first passageway 28c, the inner pipe bore 26a, and the inner tubing bore 18a to the surface.</p>
    <p num="32">
      Thus, it is seen that the upper concentric tubing string 19 provides separate flowpaths to the surface for the production fluids from the formations 14 and 16.
      <br/>
      The tubing annulus 20b provides the flowpath for the fluid from the lower formation 16 while the inner tubing bore 18a provides the flowpath for the fluid from the upper formation 14.
      <br/>
      It is also understood that the lower ESP 34 transmits the fluid from the lower formation 16 whereas the upper ESP 30 transmits the fluid from the upper formation 14.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In the first embodiment of the present invention 10, the lower ESP 34 is preferably positioned above the packer 42 as shown in FIG. 1C. This allows the ESPs 30 and 34 and electrical hardware to be retrieved to the surface without retrieving the packer 42 and also allows the packer 42 to be accurately set at the correct depth in the casing 12.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the packer 42 could be positioned above the lower ESP 34 and run down with the lower ESP 34.
      <br/>
      With the lower ESP 34 positioned above the packer 42, the capsule 38 provides pressure isolation between the two zones 14 and 16.
      <br/>
      A suction inlet 34a (FIG. 1C) to the lower ESP 34 is typically located along the side of the lower ESP 34.
      <br/>
      Thus, the fluid from the lower zone 16 passes through the lower stinger 40 and begins to fill the capsule 38.
      <br/>
      The fluid is drawn into the suction inlet 34a and discharged into the lower tubing section 36.
      <br/>
      The capsule 38 prevents fluid from the upper formation 14 from entering the suction inlet 34a of the lower ESP 34 while providing a chamber for the lower formation fluid above the packer and before being transduced by the lower ESP 34.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Electric submersible pumps require electric power.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the upper and lower transducers 30 and 34, respectively, are electric submersible pumps, they require electric power.
      <br/>
      In such a situation, it is preferable to have separate and unique control of the upper ESP 30 and the lower ESP 34.
      <br/>
      Thus, preferably a separate electric power cable (not shown) is run for each ESP 30, 34 from the wellhead or surface down to the ESP 30, 34.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the electric power cable for each ESP 30, 34 is run along the outside surface of the outer production tubing string 20 and the flow crossover assembly 22 and down to the respective ESP 30 or 34.
      <br/>
      This allows the electric power cables to be out of the flow path of the high pressure fluids discharged from the ESPs 30, 34 since the high pressure fluids are within the lower piping 32 and 36, the flow crossover assembly 22, and the concentric tubing string 19.
      <br/>
      This feature is desirable as it prevents electric power cable failures caused by contact with high pressure pump discharge fluids.
      <br/>
      It is additionally preferable from an installation standpoint as will be explained below.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Another obstacle to having more than one transducer in a non-flowing well is the difficulty with installation and the risk of damaging some components before reaching the desired location in the well.
      <br/>
      The first system 10 reduces both the difficulty and the risks involved.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the inner production tubing string 18 is run independently from the outer production tubing string 20.
      <br/>
      The lower stinger 40, capsule 38 with lower ESP 34, lower tubing section 36, upper ESP 30, spool piece 32, flow crossover assembly 22, and the ESP power cables (not shown) are all deployed on the outer production tubing string 20 as one assembly.
      <br/>
      The packer 42 can be deployed either with this assembly or deployed prior to this assembly via common industry methods such as wireline or tubing.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      As stated above, the inner production tubing string 18 is run independently from the outer production tubing string 20 after the above assembly has been installed.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, a sealing bore 24b is placed inside of the upper portion of the inner production pipe 24 within the flow crossover assembly 22.
      <br/>
      This sealing bore 24b has a smooth internal surface that allows for a set of seals 44 (FIG. 3), as for example O-rings, run on a tubing adapter stinger 46 at the lower end 18b of the inner production tubing string 18 to form a fluid and pressure seal.
      <br/>
      Thus, the pressure and fluid coming through the inner production pipe 24 of the flow crossover assembly 22 is prevented from mixing with the fluid flowing in the outer production pipe 26.
      <br/>
      The upper end of the inner production pipe 24 is preferably maintained concentrically located within the outer production pipe 26 with a centralizer 47.
      <br/>
      This will allow easier stabbing of the tubing adapter stinger 46 in the inner production pipe 24.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, the tubing adapter stinger 46 may comprise a number of short pup sections 48 which are threadably joined together and having seal grooves 48a for receiving the seals 44.
      <br/>
      The tubing adapter stinger 46 is retained in position by the weight of the inner production tubing string 18.
      <br/>
      The integrity of the seal can be tested by landing a wireline plug (not shown) in the lower end of the sealing bore 24b and pressurizing the inner production tubing string 18.
    </p>
    <p num="37">The sealing assembly between the tubing adapter stinger 46 and the sealing bore 24b of the inner production pipe 24 provides for the inner production tubing string 18 to be run in the well bore independently of the outer production tubing string 20, and provides for the inner production tubing string 18 to be run into and out of the well at a different time than outer production tubing string 20.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The use of the concentric tubing string 19 allows for the deployment of more than one electric cable, and more than one transducer on a single tubing string, while producing the production fluids of different formations 14 and 16 in different production tubing.
      <br/>
      In this case, the inner production tubing string 18 and inner production pipe 24 are not connected to the ESP power cable and the inner production tubing string 18 can be pulled out or run into the well independently of the outer production tubing string 20.
      <br/>
      This simplifies the deployment of two or more ESP power cables, as the ESP power cables are only connected to the outer production pipe 26 and the outer production tubing string 20.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Additionally, this concentric method of deployment allows for the use of an electric submersible pump 34 with its associated electric cable to produce one interval or formation 16, while a second transducer 30, for example, a positive displacement pump, is run in or out of the hole on the inner production tubing string 18 separately and independently of the outer production tubing string 20 and the ESP transducer 34.</p>

      It is to be understood that the second system 100 and third system 200 provide for the downhole separation and separate conduction of liquids and gases in the wellbore using a submersible transducer and separator.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 is an alternative arrangement of the lower portion of the third system 200 having downhole monitoring equipment.
      <br/>
      By using downhole monitoring equipment the performance of the transducer 230' can be monitored on the surface, and interactively controlled to speed up the flow through the liquid/gas separator 234'. With reference to FIG. 6, this is accomplished by the control of a throttle valve (not shown) at P1, control of an actuated valve (not shown) at P2, or by the pressure drop achieved across the liquid/gas separator 234' by changing the rate of the transducer 230'. Hence by using the system of concentric tubing and separating the liquid/gas separator 234' from the transducer 230', a controlled submersible separation process can be deployed in a well bore.
      <br/>
      If the separator 234' is damaged or needs to be changed due to changes in the interval's production, or any other reason, the separator 234' is changed without requiring the changing of the transducer 230' and its associated equipment.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The systems 100 and 200 and as shown in FIG. 6 provide a method of separating gas from liquid downhole in combination with a submersible transducer in such a manner as to bypass the gas around the upper submersible transducer, control the separation process downhole, and make the gas separation equipment retrievable from the wellbore independent of the retrieval of the submersible transducer.
      <br/>
      This allows the use of transducers in a well where the currently available gas separation equipment is deficient (and causes severe efficiency losses in the transducers due to gas compression).
      <br/>
      By connecting the liquid/gas separator to a separate concentric conduit, and forcing all the reservoir fluids to pass through the separator prior to contacting the fluid transducer, the present invention offers a significant amount of control of the separation process, while enhancing the extraction of the gas, due to increased velocity in the smaller tubing, and simultaneously removing the gas from contact with the fluid transducer.
      <br/>
      The liquid/gas separation device is further enhanced by the use of the transducer to develop the required and controlled pressure drop across the liquid/gas separation device.
      <br/>
      This avoidance of gas contact with the fluid transducer is significant for the electric submersible transducer power cable C (FIG. 6), located on the outer diameter of the outer concentric string, as it reduces damage to the transducer's power cable typically induced by gas corrosion, erosion, impregnation, and the damage due to associated products of gas production, for example scales and other precipitates.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      It is also envisioned that the expanding gas that is separated from the production stream can be used to augment the fluid lifting capacity of the fluid transducer in the well.
      <br/>
      With reference to FIG. 6, this can be accomplished by diverting a portion of the expanding gas into the production conduit connected to the discharge of the fluid transducer 230' at P3 to induce a gas lift effect.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the use of the expanding gas in the concentric string can be manipulated to thermodynamically cool downhole instruments and electric motors.
    </p>
    <p num="61">It is to be understood that the present invention allows for the simultaneous separate production of more than one zone in a well bore of different pressures, fluids, gases, or solids using transducers, including transducers that require electric power cables.</p>
    <p num="62">
      It is to be understood that the embodiments of the present invention allow for the running and pulling of the inner concentric string independent of the outer string, due to the unique combination of the flow crossover assembly with "Y"-tool convergence in combination with the sealing adapter for the inner concentric string.
      <br/>
      This invention further allows the inner concentric string to deploy a mechanically, or hydraulically powered transducer or apparatus that can be pulled or run from the well without disturbing the electric submersible transducer and the outer concentric tubing string.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      This invention also allows for the forced separation of liquids and gas by the combination of the liquid/gas separation equipment, downhole monitoring equipment, the inner concentric tubing string, and the deployment and retrieval of the liquid/gas separation equipment without retrieving the transducer.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the invention's placement of the packer, and liquid/gas separation device with the "Y"-tool convergence allows for all liquids and gases to be forced through the separation device, and to use the transducer and its control devices like variable speed drives, as well as other downhole valves, and measurement instruments, to control the separation process.

    <p num="64">
      The present invention also allows for the forced and controlled separation of liquids and gases and subsequent conduction of the separated products in concentric tubing strings thus allowing for the expanding gas to assist in lifting fluids from the discharge of the transducer.
      <br/>
      This technique provides a means of using gas lifting techniques and submersible transducer techniques in the same well bore.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      This present invention further provides for the use of expanding gas for thermodynamic cooling of devices deployed in the well bore.
      <br/>
      Currently, all electrical, optical, and electronic equipment run into well bores have a run life dependent of the temperatures in the well bore.
      <br/>
      This invention yields a refrigeration method for downhole devices.
