    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention is in the field of maize breeding, specifically relating to an inbred maize line designated PH3P0.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The goal of plant breeding is to combine in a single variety or hybrid various desirable traits.
      <br/>
      For field crops, these traits may include resistance to diseases and insects, tolerance to heat and drought, reducing the time to crop maturity, greater yield, and better agronomic quality.
      <br/>
      With mechanical harvesting of many crops, uniformity of plant characteristics such as germination and stand establishment, growth rate, maturity, and plant and ear height, is important.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Field crops are bred through techniques that take advantage of the plant's method of pollination.
      <br/>
      A plant is self-pollinated if pollen from one flower is transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant.
      <br/>
      A plant is cross-pollinated if the pollen comes from a flower on a different plant.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Plants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type for many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny.
      <br/>
      A cross between two different homozygous lines produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that may be heterozygous for many gene loci.
      <br/>
      A cross of two plants each heterozygous at a number of gene loci will produce a population of hybrid plants that differ genetically and will not be uniform.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Maize (zea mays L.), often referred to as corn in the United States, can be bred by both self-pollination and cross-pollination techniques.
      <br/>
      Maize has separate male and female flowers on the same plant, located on the tassel and the ear, respectively.
      <br/>
      Natural pollination occurs in maize when wind blows pollen from the tassels to the silks that protrude from the tops of the ears.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A reliable method of controlling male fertility in plants offers the opportunity for improved plant breeding.
      <br/>
      This is especially true for development of maize hybrids, which relies upon some sort of male sterility system.
      <br/>
      There are several options for controlling male fertility available to breeders, such as: manual or mechanical emasculation (or detasseling), cytoplasmic male sterility, genetic male sterility, gametocides and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Hybrid maize seed is typically produced by a male sterility system incorporating manual or mechanical detasseling.
      <br/>
      Alternate strips of two maize inbreds are planted in a field, and the pollen-bearing tassels are removed from one of the inbreds (female).
      <br/>
      Providing that there is sufficient isolation from sources of foreign maize pollen, the ears of the detasseled inbred will be fertilized only from the other inbred (male), and the resulting seed is therefore hybrid and will form hybrid plants.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The laborious, and occasionally unreliable, detasseling process can be avoided by using cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) inbreds.
      <br/>
      Plants of a CMS inbred are male sterile as a result of factors resulting from the cytoplasmic, as opposed to the nuclear, genome.
      <br/>
      Thus, this characteristic is inherited exclusively through the female parent in maize plants, since only the female provides cytoplasm to the fertilized seed.
      <br/>
      CMS plants are fertilized with pollen from another inbred that is not male-sterile.
      <br/>
      Pollen from the second inbred may or may not contribute genes that make the hybrid plants male-fertile.
      <br/>
      Seed from detasseled fertile maize and CMS produced seed of the same hybrid can be blended to insure that adequate pollen loads are available for fertilization when the hybrid plants are grown.

      There are several methods of conferring genetic male sterility available, such as multiple mutant genes at separate locations within the genome that confer male sterility, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,654,465 and 4,727,219 to Brar et al. and chromosomal translocations as described by Patterson in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,861,709 and 3,710,511.
      <br/>
      These and all patents referred to are incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      In addition to these methods, Albertsen et al., of Pioneer Hi-Bred, U.S. Patent No. 5,432,068, have developed a system of nuclear male sterility which includes: identifying a gene which is critical to male fertility; silencing this native gene which is critical to male fertility; removing the native promoter from the essential male fertility gene and replacing it with an inducible promoter; inserting this genetically engineered gene back into the plant; and thus creating a plant that is male sterile because the inducible promoter is not "on" resulting in the male fertility gene not being transcribed.
      <br/>
      Fertility is restored by inducing, or turning "on", the promoter, which in turn allows the gene that confers male fertility to be transcribed.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      There are many other methods of conferring genetic male sterility in the art, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.
      <br/>
      These methods use a variety of approaches such as delivering into the plant a gene encoding a cytotoxic substance associated with a male tissue specific promoter or an antisense system in which a gene critical to fertility is identified and an antisense to that gene is inserted in the plant (see: Fabinjanski, et al.

      EPO 89/3010153.8 publication no. 329,308 and PCT application PCT/CA90/00037 published as WO 90/08828).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Another system useful in controlling male sterility makes use of gametocides.
      <br/>
      Gametocides are not a genetic system, but rather a topical application of chemicals.
      <br/>
      These chemicals affect cells that are critical to male fertility.
      <br/>
      The application of these chemicals affects fertility in the plants only for the growing season in which the gametocide is applied (see Carlson, Glenn R., U.S. Pat. No. 4,936,904).
      <br/>
      Application of the gametocide, timing of the application and genotype specificity often limit the usefulness of the approach.

    <p num="12">Development of Maize Inbred Lines</p>
    <p num="13">
      The use of male sterile inbreds is but one factor in the production of maize hybrids.
      <br/>
      Plant breeding techniques known in the art and used in a maize plant breeding program include, but are not limited to, recurrent selection, backcrossing, pedigree breeding, restriction length polymorphism enhanced selection, genetic marker enhanced selection and transformation.
      <br/>
      The development of maize hybrids in a maize plant breeding program requires, in general, the development of homozygous inbred lines, the crossing of these lines, and the evaluation of the crosses.
      <br/>
      Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection breeding methods are used to develop inbred lines from breeding populations.
      <br/>
      Maize plant breeding programs combine the genetic backgrounds from two or more inbred lines or various other germplasm sources into breeding pools from which new inbred lines are developed by selfing and selection of desired phenotypes.
      <br/>
      The new inbreds are crossed with other inbred lines and the hybrids from these crosses are evaluated to determine which of those have commercial potential.
      <br/>
      Plant breeding and hybrid development, as practiced in a maize plant breeding program, are expensive and time consuming processes.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Pedigree breeding starts with the crossing of two genotypes, each of which may have one or more desirable characteristics that is lacking in the other or which complements the other.
      <br/>
      If the two original parents do not provide all the desired characteristics, other sources can be included in the breeding population.
      <br/>
      In the pedigree method, superior plants are selfed and selected in successive generations.
      <br/>
      In the succeeding generations the heterozygous condition gives way to homogeneous lines as a result of self-pollination and selection.
      <br/>
      Typically in the pedigree method of breeding five or more generations of selfing and selection is practiced: F1 --&gt; F2 ; F2 --&gt; F3 ; F3 --&gt; F4 ; F4 --&gt; F5, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Recurrent selection breeding, backcrossing for example, can be used to improve an inbred line and a hybrid which is made using those inbreds.
      <br/>
      Backcrossing can be used to transfer a specific desirable trait from one inbred or source to an inbred that lacks that trait.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished, for example, by first crossing a superior inbred (recurrent parent) to a donor inbred (non-recurrent parent), that carries the appropriate gene(s) for the trait in question.
      <br/>
      The progeny of this cross is then mated back to the superior recurrent parent followed by selection in the resultant progeny for the desired trait to be transferred from the non-recurrent parent.
      <br/>
      After five or more backcross generations with selection for the desired trait, the progeny will be homozygous for loci controlling the characteristic being transferred, but will be like the superior parent for essentially all other genes.
      <br/>
      The last backcross generation is then selfed to give pure breeding progeny for the gene(s) being transferred.
      <br/>
      A hybrid developed from inbreds containing the transferred gene(s) is essentially the same as a hybrid developed from the same inbreds without the transferred gene(s).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Elite inbred lines, that is, pure breeding, homozygous inbred lines, can also be used as starting materials for breeding or source populations from which to develop other inbred lines.
      <br/>
      These inbred lines derived from elite inbred lines can be developed using the pedigree breeding and recurrent selection breeding methods described earlier.
      <br/>
      As an example, when backcross breeding is used to create these derived lines in a maize plant breeding program, elite inbreds can be used as a parental line or starting material or source population and can serve as either the donor or recurrent parent.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Development of Maize Hybrids</p>
    <p num="18">
      A single cross maize hybrid results from the cross of two inbred lines, each of which has a genotype that complements the genotype of the other.
      <br/>
      The hybrid progeny of the first generation is designated F1.
      <br/>
      In the development of commercial hybrids in a maize plant breeding program, only the F1 hybrid plants are sought.
      <br/>
      Preferred F1 hybrids are more vigorous than their inbred parents.
      <br/>
      This hybrid vigor, or heterosis, can be manifested in many polygenic traits, including increased vegetative growth and increased yield.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The development of a maize hybrid in a maize plant breeding program involves three steps: (1) the selection of plants from various germplasm pools for initial breeding crosses; (2) the selfing of the selected plants from the breeding crosses for several generations to produce a series of inbred lines, which, although different from each other, breed true and are highly uniform; and (3) crossing the selected inbred lines with different inbred lines to produce the hybrid progeny (F1).
      <br/>
      During the inbreeding process in maize, the vigor of the lines decreases.
      <br/>
      Vigor is restored when two different inbred lines are crossed to produce the hybrid progeny (F1).
      <br/>
      An important consequence of the homozygosity and homogeneity of the inbred lines is that the hybrid between a defined pair of inbreds will always be the same.
      <br/>
      Once the inbreds that give a superior hybrid have been identified, the hybrid seed can be reproduced indefinitely as long as the homogeneity of the inbred parents is maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A single cross hybrid is produced when two inbred lines are crossed to produce the F1 progeny.
      <br/>
      A double cross hybrid is produced from four inbred lines crossed in pairs (A * B and C * D) and then the two F1 hybrids are crossed again (A * B) * (C * D).
      <br/>
      Much of the hybrid vigor exhibited by F1 hybrids is lost in the next generation (F2).
      <br/>
      Consequently, seed from hybrids is not used for planting stock.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Hybrid seed production requires elimination or inactivation of pollen produced by the female parent.
      <br/>
      Incomplete removal or inactivation of the pollen provides the potential for self pollination.
      <br/>
      This inadvertently self pollinated seed may be unintentionally harvested and packaged with hybrid seed.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Once the seed is planted, it is possible to identify and select these self pollinated plants.
      <br/>
      These self pollinated plants will be genetically equivalent to the female inbred line used to produce the hybrid.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Typically these self pollinated plants can be identified and selected due to their decreased vigor.
      <br/>
      Female selfs are identified by their less vigorous appearance for vegetative and/or reproductive characteristics, including shorter plant height, small ear size, ear and kernel shape, cob color, or other characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Identification of these self-pollinated lines can also be accomplished through molecular marker analyses.
      <br/>
      See, "The Identification of Female Selfs in Hybrid Maize: A Comparison Using Electrophoresis and Morphology", Smith, J. S. C. and Wych, R. D., Seed Science and Technology 14, pp. 1-8 (1995), the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Through these technologies, the homozygosity of the self pollinated line can be verified by analyzing allelic composition at various loci along the genome.
      <br/>
      Those methods allow for rapid identification of the invention disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      See also, "Identification of Atypical Plants in Hybrid Maize Seed by Postcontrol and Electrophoresis" Sarca, V. et al., Probleme de Genetica Teoritica si Aplicata Vol. 20 (1) p. 29-42.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      As is readily apparent to one skilled in the art, the foregoing are only some of the various ways by which the inbred can be obtained by those looking to use the germplasm.
      <br/>
      Other means are available, and the above examples are illustrative only.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Maize is an important and valuable field crop.
      <br/>
      Thus, a continuing goal of plant breeders is to develop high-yielding maize hybrids that are agronomically sound based on stable inbred lines.
      <br/>
      The reasons for this goal are obvious: to maximize the amount of grain produced with the inputs used and minimize susceptibility of the crop to pests and environmental stresses.
      <br/>
      To accomplish this goal, the maize breeder must select and develop superior inbred parental lines for producing hybrids.
      <br/>
      This requires identification and selection of genetically unique individuals that occur in a segregating population.
      <br/>
      The segregating population is the result of a combination of crossover events plus the independent assortment of specific combinations of alleles at many gene loci that results in specific genotypes.
      <br/>
      The probability of selecting any one individual with a specific genotype from a breeding cross is infinitesimal due to the large number of segregating genes and the unlimited recombinations of these genes, some of which may be closely linked.
      <br/>
      However, the genetic variation among individual progeny of a breeding cross allows for the identification of rare and valuable new genotypes.
      <br/>
      These new genotypes are neither predictable nor incremental in value, but rather the result of manifested genetic variation combined with selection methods, environments and the actions of the breeder.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Thus, even if the entire genotypes of the parents of the breeding cross were characterized and a desired genotype known, only a few if any individuals having the desired genotype may be found in a large segregating F2 population.
      <br/>
      Typically, however, neither the genotypes of the breeding cross parents nor the desired genotype to be selected is known in any detail.
      <br/>
      In addition to the preceding problem, it is not known how the genotype would react with the environment.
      <br/>
      This genotype by environment interaction is an important, yet unpredictable, factor in plant breeding.
      <br/>
      A breeder of ordinary skill in the art cannot predict the genotype, how that genotype will interact with various climatic conditions or the resulting phenotypes of the developing lines, except perhaps in a very broad and general fashion.
      <br/>
      A breeder of ordinary skill in the art would also be unable to recreate the same line twice from the very same original parents as the breeder is unable to direct how the genomes combine or how they will interact with the environmental conditions.
      <br/>
      This unpredictability results in the expenditure of large amounts of research resources in the development of a superior new maize inbred line.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="105">
      Inbred maize lines are typically developed for use in the production of hybrid maize lines.
      <br/>
      Inbred maize lines need to be highly homogeneous, homozygous and reproducible to be useful as parents of commercial hybrids.
      <br/>
      There are many analytical methods available to determine the homozygotic and phenotypic stability of these inbred lines.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      The oldest and most traditional method of analysis is the observation of phenotypic traits.
      <br/>
      The data is usually collected in field experiments over the life of the maize plants to be examined.
      <br/>
      Phenotypic characteristics most often observed are for traits associated with plant morphology, ear and kernel morphology, insect and disease resistance, maturity, and yield.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      In addition to phenotypic observations, the genotype of a plant can also be examined.
      <br/>
      There are many laboratory-based techniques available for the analysis, comparison and characterization of plant genotype; among these are Isozyme Electrophoresis, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs), and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) which are also referred to as Microsatellites.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      The most widely used of these laboratory techniques are Isozyme Electrophoresis and RFLPs as discussed in Lee, M., "Inbred Lines of Maize and Their Molecular Markers," The Maize Handbook, (Springer-Verlag, New York, Inc. 1994, at 423-432) incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Isozyme Electrophoresis is a useful tool in determining genetic composition, although it has relatively low number of available markers and the low number of allelic variants among maize inbreds.
      <br/>
      RFLPs have the advantage of revealing an exceptionally high degree of allelic variation in maize and the number of available markers is almost limitless.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      Maize RFLP linkage maps have been rapidly constructed and widely implemented in genetic studies.
      <br/>
      One such study is described in Boppenmaier, et al., "Comparisons among strains of inbreds for RFLPs", Maize Genetics Cooperative Newsletter, 65:1991, pg. 90, is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      This study used 101 RFLP markers to analyze the patterns of 2 to 3 different deposits each of five different inbred lines.
      <br/>
      The inbred lines had been selfed from 9 to 12 times before being adopted into 2 to 3 different breeding programs.
      <br/>
      It was results from these 2 to 3 different breeding programs that supplied the different deposits for analysis.
      <br/>
      These five lines were maintained in the separate breeding programs by selfing or sibbing and rogueing off-type plants for an additional one to eight generations.
      <br/>
      After the RFLP analysis was completed, it was determined the five lines showed 0-2% residual heterozygosity.
      <br/>
      Although this was a relatively small study, it can be seen using RFLPs that the lines had been highly homozygous prior to the separate strain maintenance.

      Inbred maize line PH3P0 is a yellow, dent maize inbred that is suited as a female for producing first generation F1 maize hybrids.
      <br/>
      Inbred maize line PH3P0 is best adapted to the Northcentral region of the United States and the southern Manitoba area of Canada, and can be used to produce hybrids from approximately 81 relative maturity based on the Comparative Relative Maturity Rating System for harvest moisture of grain.
      <br/>
      Inbred maize line PH3P0 demonstrates early maturity and good yields as an inbred per se.
      <br/>
      In hybrid combination, PH3P0 demonstrates early maturity, good stalk strength, and good seedling vigor and shows early maturity, good drydown and good seedling vigor for its area of adaptation.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      The inbred has shown uniformity and stability within the limits of environmental influence for all the traits as described in the Variety Description Information (Table 1) that follows.
      <br/>
      The inbred has been self-pollinated and ear-rowed a sufficient number of generations with careful attention paid to uniformity of plant type to ensure the homozygosity and phenotypic stability necessary to use in commercial production.
      <br/>
      The line has been increased both by hand and in isolated fields with continued observation for uniformity.
      <br/>
      No variant traits have been observed or are expected in PH3P0.
    </p>
    <p num="112">Inbred maize line PH3P0, being substantially homozygous, can be reproduced by planting seeds of the line, growing the resulting maize plants under self-pollinating or sib-pollinating conditions with adequate isolation, and harvesting the resulting seed, using techniques familiar to the agricultural arts.</p>

    <heading>FURTHER EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="114">
      This invention also is directed to methods for producing a maize plant by crossing a first parent maize plant with a second parent maize plant wherein either the first or second parent maize plant is an inbred maize plant of the line PH3P0.
      <br/>
      Further, both first and second parent maize plants can come from the inbred maize line PH3P0.
      <br/>
      Still further, this invention also is directed to methods for producing an inbred maize line PH3P0-derived maize plant by crossing inbred maize line PH3P0 with a second maize plant and growing the progeny seed, and repeating the crossing and growing steps with the inbred maize line PH3P0-derived plant from 0 to 5 times.
      <br/>
      Thus, any such methods using the inbred maize line PH3P0 are part of this invention: selfing, backcrosses, hybrid production, crosses to populations, and the like.
      <br/>
      All plants produced using inbred maize line PH3P0 as a parent are within the scope of this invention, including plants derived from inbred maize line PH3P0.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, the inbred maize line is used in crosses with other, different, maize inbreds to produce first generation (F1) maize hybrid seeds and plants with superior characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      It should be understood that the inbred can, through routine manipulation of cytoplasmic or other factors, be produced in a male-sterile form.
      <br/>
      Such embodiments are also contemplated within the scope of the present claims.
    </p>
    <p num="116">As used herein, the term plant includes plant cells, plant protoplasts, plant cell tissue cultures from which maize plants can be regenerated, plant calli, plant clumps, and plant cells that are intact in plants or parts of plants, such as embryos, pollen, ovules, seeds, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, leaves, husks, stalks, roots, root tips, anthers, silk and the like.</p>
    <p num="117">
      Duncan, Williams, Zehr, and Widholm, Planta (1985) 165:322-332 reflects that 97% of the plants cultured that produced callus were capable of plant regeneration.
      <br/>
      Subsequent experiments with both inbreds and hybrids produced 91% regenerable callus that produced plants.
      <br/>
      In a further study in 1988, Songstad, Duncan &amp; Widholm in Plant Cell Reports (1988), 7:262-265 reports several media additions that enhance regenerability of callus of two inbred lines.
      <br/>
      Other published reports also indicated that "nontraditional" tissues are capable of producing somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration. K. P. Rao, et al., Maize Genetics Cooperation Newsletter, 60:64-65 (1986), refers to somatic embryogenesis from glume callus cultures and B. V. Conger, et al., Plant Cell Reports, 6:345-347 (1987) indicates somatic embryogenesis from the tissue cultures of maize leaf segments.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is clear from the literature that the state of the art is such that these methods of obtaining plants are, and were, "conventional" in the sense that they are routinely used and have a very high rate of success.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      Tissue culture of maize is described in European Patent Application, publication 160,390, incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Maize tissue culture procedures are also described in Green and Rhodes, "Plant Regeneration in Tissue Culture of Maize," Maize for Biological Research (Plant Molecular Biology Association, Charlottesville, Va. 1982, at 367-372) and in Duncan, et al., "The Production of Callus Capable of Plant Regeneration from Immature Embryos of Numerous Zea Mays Genotypes," 165 Planta 322-332 (1985).
      <br/>
      Thus, another aspect of this invention is to provide cells which upon growth and differentiation produce maize plants having the physiological and morphological characteristics of inbred line PH3P0.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      The utility of inbred maize line PH3P0 also extends to crosses with other species.
      <br/>
      Commonly, suitable species will be of the family Graminaceae, and especially of the genera Zea, Tripsacum, Coix, Schlerachne, Polytoca, Chionachne, and Trilobachne, of the tribe Maydeae.
      <br/>
      Potentially suitable for crosses with PH3P0 may be the various varieties of grain sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.

    <p num="120">Transformation of Maize</p>
    <p num="121">
      With the advent of molecular biological techniques that have allowed the isolation and characterization of genes that encode specific protein products, scientists in the field of plant biology developed a strong interest in engineering the genome of plants to contain and express foreign genes, or additional, or modifed versions of native or endogenous genes (perhaps driven by different promoters) in order to alter the traits of a plant in a specific manner.
      <br/>
      Such foreign, additional and/or modified genes are referred to herein collectively as "transgenes".
      <br/>
      Over the last fifteen to twenty years several methods for producing transgenic plants have been developed, and the present invention, in particular embodiments, also relates to transformed versions of the claimed inbred maize line PH3P0.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      Plant transformation involves the construction of an expression vector which will function in plant cells.
      <br/>
      Such a vector comprises DNA comprising a gene under control of or operatively linked to a regulatory element (for example, a promoter).
      <br/>
      The expression vector may contain one or more such operably linked gene/regulatory element combinations.
      <br/>
      The vector(s) may be in the form of a plasmid, and can be used, alone or in combination with other plasmids, to provide transformed maize plants, using transformation methods as described below to incorporate transgenes into the genetic material of the maize plant(s).
    </p>
    <p num="123">Expression Vectors For Maize Transformation</p>
    <p num="124">Marker Genes</p>
    <p num="125">
      Expression vectors include at least one genetic marker, operably linked to a regulatory element (a promoter, for example) that allows transformed cells containing the marker to be either recovered by negative selection, i.e. inhibiting growth of cells that do not contain the selectable marker gene, or by positive selection, i.e., screening for the product encoded by the genetic marker.
      <br/>
      Many commonly used selectable marker genes for plant transformation are well known in the transformation arts, and include, for example, genes that code for enzymes that metabolically detoxify a selective chemical agent which may be an antibiotic or a herbicide, or genes that encode an altered target which is insensitive to the inhibitor.
      <br/>
      A few positive selection methods are also known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      One commonly used selectable marker gene for plant transformation is the neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII) gene, isolated from transposon Tn5, which when placed under the control of plant regulatory signals confers resistance to kanamycin.

      Fraley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 80: 4803 (1983).

      Another class of marker genes for plant transformation require screening of presumptively transformed plant cells rather than direct genetic selection of transformed cells for resistance to a toxic substance such as an antibiotic.
      <br/>
      These genes are particularly useful to quantify or visualize the spatial pattern of expression of a gene in specific tissues and are frequently referred to as reporter genes because they can be fused to a gene or gene regulatory sequence for the investigation of gene expression.
      <br/>
      Commonly used genes for screening presumptively transformed cells include  BETA -glucuronidase (GUS),  BETA -galactosidase, luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.

    <p num="133">
      Genes included in expression vectors must be driven by a nucleotide sequence comprising a regulatory element, for example, a promoter.
      <br/>
      Several types of promoters are now well known in the transformation arts, as are other regulatory elements that can be used alone or in combination with promoters.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      As used herein "promoter" includes reference to a region of DNA upstream from the start of transcription and involved in recognition and binding of RNA polymerase and other proteins to initiate transcription.
      <br/>
      A "plant promoter" is a promoter capable of initiating transcription in plant cells.
      <br/>
      Examples of promoters under developmental control include promoters that preferentially initiate transcription in certain tissues, such as leaves, roots, seeds, fibers, xylem vessels, tracheids, or sclerenchyma.
      <br/>
      Such promoters are referred to as "tissue-preferred".
      <br/>
      Promoters which initiate transcription only in certain tissues are referred to as "tissue-specific".
      <br/>
      A "cell type" specific promoter primarily drives expression in certain cell types in one or more organs, for example, vascular cells in roots or leaves.
      <br/>
      An "inducible" promoter is a promoter which is under environmental control.
      <br/>
      Examples of environmental conditions that may effect transcription by inducible promoters include anaerobic conditions or the presence of light.
      <br/>
      Tissue-specific, tissue-preferred, cell type specific, and inducible promoters constitute the class of "non-constitutive" promoters.
      <br/>
      A "constitutive" promoter is a promoter which is active under most environmental conditions.

      Optionally, the inducible promoter is operably linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding a signal sequence which is operably linked to a gene for expression in maize.
      <br/>
      With an inducible promoter the rate of transcription increases in response to an inducing agent.

      <br/>
      A particularly preferred inducible promoter is a promoter that responds to an inducing agent to which plants do not normally respond.
      <br/>

    <p num="148">
      With transgenic plants according to the present invention, a foreign protein can be produced in commercial quantities.
      <br/>
      Thus, techniques for the selection and propagation of transformed plants, which are well understood in the art, yield a plurality of transgenic plants which are harvested in a conventional manner, and a foreign protein then can be extracted from a tissue of interest or from total biomass.
      <br/>
      Protein extraction from plant biomass can be accomplished by known methods which are discussed, for example, by Heney and Orr, Anal.

      In another preferred embodiment, the biomass of interest is seed.
      <br/>
      For the relatively small number of transgenic plants that show higher levels of expression, a genetic map can be generated, primarily via conventional Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis, and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) which identifies the approximate chromosomal location of the integrated DNA molecule.
      <br/>
      For exemplary methodologies in this regard, see Glick and Thompson, METHODS IN PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY 269-284 (CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993).
      <br/>
      Map information concerning chromosomal location is useful for proprietary protection of a subject transgenic plant.
      <br/>
      If unauthorized propagation is undertaken and crosses made with other germplasm, the map of the integration region can be compared to similar maps for suspect plants, to determine if the latter have a common parentage with the subject plant.

      Map comparisons would involve hybridizations, RFLP, PCR, SSR and sequencing, all of which are conventional techniques.

      A generally applicable method of plant transformation is microprojectile-mediated transformation wherein DNA is carried on the surface of microprojectiles measuring 1 to 4  MU m. The expression vector is introduced into plant tissues with a biolistic device that accelerates the microprojectiles to speeds of 300 to 600 m/s which is sufficient to penetrate plant cell walls and membranes.

      In maize, several target tissues can be bombarded with DNA-coated microprojectiles in order to produce transgenic plants, including, for example, callus (Type I or Type II), immature embryos, and meristematic tissue.

    <p num="186">
      Another method for physical delivery of DNA to plants is sonication of target cells.

      Following transformation of maize target tissues, expression of the above-described selectable marker genes allows for preferential selection of transformed cells, tissues and/or plants, using regeneration and selection methods now well known in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, transformed maize immature embryos.
    </p>
    <p num="188">
      The foregoing methods for transformation would typically be used for producing transgenic inbred lines.
      <br/>
      Transgenic inbred lines could then be crossed, with another (non-transformed or transformed) inbred line, in order to produce a transgenic hybrid maize plant.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a genetic trait which has been engineered into a particular maize line using the foregoing transformation techniques could be moved into another line using traditional backcrossing techniques that are well known in the plant breeding arts.
      <br/>
      For example, a backcrossing approach could be used to move an engineered trait from a public, non-elite line into an elite line, or from a hybrid maize plant containing a foreign gene in its genome into a line or lines which do not contain that gene.
      <br/>
      As used herein, "crossing" can refer to a simple X by Y cross, or the process of backcrossing, depending on the context.

    <p num="190">
      Maize is used as human food, livestock feed, and as raw material in industry.
      <br/>
      The food uses of maize, in addition to human consumption of maize kernels, include both products of dry- and wet-milling industries.
      <br/>
      The principal products of maize dry milling are grits, meal and flour.
      <br/>
      The maize wet-milling industry can provide maize starch, maize syrups, and dextrose for food use.
      <br/>
      Maize oil is recovered from maize germ, which is a by-product of both dry- and wet-milling industries.
    </p>
    <p num="191">Maize, including both grain and non-grain portions of the plant, is also used extensively as livestock feed, primarily for beef cattle, dairy cattle, hogs, and poultry.</p>
    <p num="192">
      Industrial uses of maize include production of ethanol, maize starch in the wet-milling industry and maize flour in the dry-milling industry.
      <br/>
      The industrial applications of maize starch and flour are based on functional properties, such as viscosity, film formation, adhesive properties, and ability to suspend particles.
      <br/>
      The maize starch and flour have application in the paper and textile industries.
      <br/>
      Other industrial uses include applications in adhesives, building materials, foundry binders, laundry starches, explosives, oil-well muds, and other mining applications.
    </p>
    <p num="193">Plant parts other than the grain of maize are also used in industry: for example, stalks and husks are made into paper and wallboard and cobs are used for fuel and to make charcoal.</p>
    <p num="194">The seed of inbred maize line PH3P0, the plant produced from the inbred seed, the hybrid maize plant produced from the crossing of the inbred, hybrid seed, and various parts of the hybrid maize plant and transgenic versions of the foregoing, can be utilized for human food, livestock feed, and as a raw material in industry.</p>
