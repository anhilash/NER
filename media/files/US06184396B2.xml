      Mycosis can be classified into two types, that is, superficial mycosis represented by various trichophytosis, marginated eczema, psoriasis, cutaneous candidiasis or the like and deep seated mycosis represented by mycotic meningitis, mycotic infectious disease of respiratory organ, fungemia, mycosis of urinary tract or the like.
      <br/>
      Of these, deep seated mycosis such as candidiasis or aspergillosis tends to show a marked increase in recent days owing to the frequent use of an anticancer chemotherapeutic agent or immunosuppressive agent or lowering in the bioimmunology due to HIV infection or the like.
      <br/>
      There is accordingly a demand for a pharmaceutical efficacious against fungi causing such diseases.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      As pharmaceuticals effective against Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp., Amphotericin B and azole base compounds such as Fluconazole and Itraconazole are conventionally known, but not so many pharmaceuticals have been commercially available yet.
      <br/>
      In addition, the above-exemplified pharmaceuticals involve problems in safety and antimycotic action.
      <br/>
      There is accordingly a demand for an antimycotic effective against Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp.
      <br/>
      Now, more effective azole base compounds are under development.
      <br/>
      For example, as a compound having a difluoromethylene group, those described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 163374/1984, 163269/1993 and 227531/1997 are known.
      <br/>
      As an azole base compound having a substituted tertiary hydroxyl group, cyclic compounds as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 217778/1996 and 333367/1996, acyl compounds as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 104676/1996 and 183769/1997, and the like are known but they are not fully satisfactory.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a compound which has high safety and has antimycotic activity effective against Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp.</p>
    <p num="8">
      With the forgoing in view, the present inventors synthesized a number of triazole derivatives and salts thereof and carried out an investigation on their antimycotic activity effective against Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp.
      <br/>
      As a result, it has been found that a cyclopropylthio- or cyclopropylsulfonyl-containing triazole derivative represented by the below-described formula (1) and a salt thereof are superior in antimycotic activity against fungi including Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. and also in safety to the analogous compounds which have been known to date, leading to the completion of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In one aspect of the present invention, there are thus provided a triazole derivative represented by the following formula (1):  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)

    <p num="10">In another aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a pharmaceutical comprising as an effective ingredient the triazole derivative represented by the formula (1) or salt thereof.</p>
    <p num="11">In a further aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising the triazole derivative represented by the formula (1) or salt thereof and a pharmacologically acceptable carrier.</p>
    <p num="12">In a still further aspect of the present invention, there is also provided the use of the triazole derivative represented by the formula (1) or salt thereof as a pharmaceutical.</p>
    <p num="13">In a still further aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a treating method of mycotic infections, which comprises administering to a patient a pharmacologically effective amount of the triazole derivative represented by the formula (1) or salt thereof.</p>
    <p num="14">The triazole derivative or salt thereof according to the present invention has strong antimycotic activity, and an antimycotic comprising such compound as an effective ingredient is useful for the prevention and treatment of mycotic infections of mammary animals including humans.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      In the triazole derivative of the present invention, examples of the lower alkyl group represented by R1 in the formula (1) include linear or branched C1-6 alkyl groups.
      <br/>
      Specific examples include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, i-pentyl and n-hexyl.
      <br/>
      As the aralkyl group represented by R1, C7-10 aralkyl groups are preferred, with phenyl-C1-4 alkyl groups being more preferred.
      <br/>
      Specific examples include benzyl, phenethyl and phenylpropyl.
      <br/>
      As R1, methyl and benzyl groups are preferred.
      <br/>
      In X1 or X2, examples of the halogen atom include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine atoms, with the fluorine and chlorine atoms being particularly preferred.
      <br/>
      Examples of the halogenoalkyl group include the above-exemplified C1-6 alkyl groups each substituted by the above-exemplified halogen atom.
      <br/>
      Among them, perfluoro-C1-6 alkyl groups are preferred, with trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups being particularly preferred and trifluoromethyl group being more preferred.
      <br/>
      The number n of oxygen atoms stands for an integer of 0 to 2, with 0 or 2 being preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      No particular limitation is imposed on the salt of the triazole derivative (1) of the present invention insofar as it is a pharmacologically acceptable salt.

    <p num="145">
      After 4-week-old, male, ICR (CRJ: CD-1) mice were fasted for 6 hours, C. albicans IFM 40009 was inoculated to the tail vein of each of the mice to give an amount of 3.0 * 106 cells/mouse, whereby infection was caused.
      <br/>
      A control group consisted of 11 mice, while a medicament-administered group consisted of 5 mice.
      <br/>
      The medicament dissolved in 20% polyethylene glycol was orally administered 1 hour after the inoculation of the fungus and from 24 hours after the inoculation, it was administered once a day for 4 straight days, each in an amount of 1.25 mg/kg. The survival condition on Day 14 after the infection was compared.
      <br/>
      In addition, the survival days of the control group and the medicament-administered group were detected by the Kaplan-Meier method (Cox mantel test).
      <br/>
      Incidentally, Fluconazole was employed as a medicament for comparison.
      <br/>
      The results are shown in Table 2.
