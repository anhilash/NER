    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing homopolymers and/or copolymers, in an aqueous solution of ethylenically monounsaturated monomers, e.g. acrylic and/or vinylic monomers, such that, for each monomer, one can achieve a residual monomer concentration less than or equal to 300 ppm (based on the weight of the raw product), wherewith the concentration of the products is at least 38%; and wherewith these results can be achieved regardless of the monomer(s) used, and at the end of the polymerization, without the need for any intervening treatment.</p>
    <p num="4">The invention also relates to the homopolymers and/or copolymers manufactured by the described method; and the use of said homopolymers and/or copolymers, as:</p>
    <p num="5">
      milling agents and/or dispersants in aqueous suspensions of mineral materials; or
      <br/>
      sequestering agents and/or precipitation inhibitors and/or inhibitors of mineral incrustation (particularly with respect to heat transfer surfaces in industrial or household systems); or
      <br/>
      fluidifying agents for aqueous suspensions based on non-saline or saline water, which suspensions are used as drilling fluids (muds) and the like in the areas of civil engineering, construction, public works, minerals prospecting, and petroleum production; or
      <br/>
      stabilizers for suspensions of zeolites; or anti-scaling agents and dispersant agents, in detergent formulations containing hypochlorite compounds, wherewith the subject polymers do not destabilize the "chlorometric index" of said hypochlorite compounds; or
      <br/>
      "builders" in detergent compositions; or
      <br/>
      water retention agents in the paper industry.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The invention further relates to the abovementioned aqueous suspensions of mineral materials, having characteristics of long term stability and high concentrations of the mineral materials; and the use of the suspensions in areas such as paper, paints and other coatings, detergents and other cleaning agents, ceramics, mineral drilling and production (e.g. drilling-mud compositions), and other sectors which employ such suspensions.</p>
    <p num="7">2. Description of the Background</p>
    <p num="8">
      Various methods have long been known for homopolymerization, in solution, of acrylic and/or vinylic monomers, e.g. (meth)acrylic acid, maleic anhydride, and acrylamide; and for copolymerization, in aqueous solution, of acrylic acid with monoethylenically unsaturated comonomers such as, e.g., maleic anhydride, itaconic acid, acrylamide, (acrylamidomethyl)propanesulfonic acid, and acrylate esters.
      <br/>
      However, none of these methods is entirely satisfactory in the light of current and/or expected environmental regulations, particularly regulations governing the residual monomer content in the polymer in a given application, or requirements as to the color and/or odor of the product.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Eur. Pats. 0,668,298 and 0,608,845 describe methods of copolymerization which, unless subsequent treatments are employed, result in residual monomer contents which exceed 1000 ppm.
      <br/>
      These methods would not meet the standards demanded in the current market.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Eur. Pat. 0,618,240 discloses a method enabling production of polymers with lower residual monomer content, as do Eur.
      <br/>
      Pats. 0,398,724, 0,510,831, and 0,663,408; however, all have fundamental practical disadvantages connected with the method, or disadvantages such as:
      <br/>
      the use of metallic salts which promote decomposition reactions of hydrogen peroxide, e.g. the Fenton reaction, which often result(s) in ultimate products which are undesirably colored and which contain metal salts which are environmental pollutants;
      <br/>
      the use of persulfates which undergo decomposition because of the application of heat or because of redox reactions, resulting in ultimate products which undesirably contain sulfur; and
      <br/>
      the use of organic initiators, e.g. organic peroxides, particularly benzoyl peroxide, which result in the production of undesirable by-products such as certain nitrogen compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="11">U.S. Pat. No. 4,301,266 discloses a method of manufacturing acrylic acid polymers, with the disadvantage that one must use a solvent of the isopropanol type and must operate at elevated pressure.</p>
    <p num="12">
      Also known to those skilled in the art is U.S. Pat. No. 4,621,127, which discloses a method of copolymerization.
      <br/>
      The method is costly and lengthy, and requires the use of chain regulators to prepare low molecular weight polymers.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">Accordingly, one object of the invention is to provide a method which enables the production of dissolved polymers which are colorless, odorless, and which are accompanied by very low (minimum) amounts of residual monomers and undesirable organic by-products.</p>
    <p num="14">Another object of the invention is to provide a milling agent and/or dispersant for aqueous suspensions of mineral materials, which enables production of concentrated aqueous dispersions of mineral particles, which dispersions have relatively low viscosity and are durably stable even without agitation.</p>
    <p num="15">Still another object of the invention is to provide a sequestering agent and/or precipitation inhibitor and/or inhibitor of mineral incrustation, using a copolymer of the described type having a molecular weight low enough to be adapted to such applications.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Yet another object of the invention is to provide
      <br/>
      a fluidifying agent for aqueous suspensions which are used as drilling fluids (muds) and the like; or
      <br/>
      a stabilizer for suspensions of zeolites; or
      <br/>
      an anti-scaling agent and dispersant agent, for use in detergent formulations containing hypochlorite compounds, wherewith said agent does not destabilize the "chlorometric index" of said hypochlorite compounds; or
      <br/>
      a "builder" for detergent compositions and the like.
    </p>

      Briefly, these objects and other objects of the present invention as hereinafter will become more readily apparent can be attained in a method of polymerization in which compounds containing a phosphorus atom, having a degree of oxidation less than 5, are introduced in amounts corresponding to 0.005-0.49 gram-atom phosphorus per mol of unsaturation in the monomer(s) to be polymerized, into the reaction vessel or into the starting monomer mixture in the reaction vessel as into the reaction vessel, prior to the start of the polymerization, said introduction occurring:
      <br/>
      in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and
      <br/>
      in the absence of any agents, which decompose hydrogen peroxide to form free radicals, such as metals or metal salts, which agents are deemed necessary by the art to satisfactorily achieve such decomposition, further, in the absence of any other generator of free radicals, and in the absence of any per salt and/or any other transfer agent.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="19">
      Whereas the prior art to which the present invention relates describes methods of polymerization which make use of decomposition reactions of hydrogen peroxide of the type of the Fenton reaction, or employs reactions of thermal or redox decomposition of initiators currently in use, it has now been found, and quite surprisingly, that the use of a compound containing a phosphorus atom of degree of oxidation less than 5, when introduced in amounts corresponding to 0.005-0.49 g-atom phosphorus per mol of unsaturation in monomers in an aqueous reaction medium enables:
      <br/>
      homopolymerization of a monomer such as (meth)acrylic acid or maleic acid, or
      <br/>
      copolymerization of maleic acid or a copolymerizable monomer, with acrylic acid or a copolymerizable monomer, with the addition solely of hydrogen peroxide, without the presence of agents which promote decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to form free radicals, e.g. metals or metal salts, such as salts of Cu, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, W, Ce, Mo, Zr, or mixtures of these, which agents are deemed necessary in the art in order to satisfactorily achieve such decomposition, e.g. in the familiar Fenton reaction, and further without the presence of organic initiators, e.g. benzoyl peroxide, and further without the presence of per salts, e.g. persulfates, and further without the presence of other transfer agents e.g., thio compounds, alcohols, halides, amines, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The copolymerizable monomers are selected from the group consisting of (meth)acrylic acid, itaconic acid, crotonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid anhydride, isocrotonic acid, acronitic acid, mesaconic acid, sinapic acid, undecylenic acid, angelic acid; esters of the aforesaid acids; (acrylamidomethyl)propanesulfonic acid, acrolein, (meth)acrylamide; (meth)acrylamidopropyl trimethylammonium chloride, (meth)acrylamidopropyl trimethylammonium sulfate, ethyl trimethylammonium chloride (meth)acrylate, ethyl trimethylammonium sulfate (meth)acrylate, acryloyl (trimethylammonium chloride), acryloyl(trimethylammonium sulfate), or the non-quaternized homologs of any of these; dimethyldiallyl chloride, sodium methallyl sulfonate, ethylene glycol (meth)acrylate phosphate, propylene glycol (meth)acrylate phosphate, and vinylpyrrolidone.</p>
    <p num="21">
      The present method enables (co)polymerization in an aqueous phase in a continuous or semicontinuous or batch process, yielding a copolymer having a residual monomer content of less than or equal to 300 ppm on the basis of the raw product for each monomer.
      <br/>
      The concentration of the product copolymers is at least 38% regardless of the amounts of the monomers by weight, and after the termination of the polymerization, it is not necessary to resort to any of the customary treatments well-known to persons skilled in the art such as distillation or adding excess oxidizing or reducing agent following the polymerization.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The present method of manufacturing homopolymers and/or copolymers, in an aqueous solution, from ethylenically monounsaturated monomers, such as acrylic and/or vinylic monomers, occurs with compounds which contain a phosphorus atom of a degree of oxidation less than 5, which are introduced into the reaction medium in amounts corresponding to 0.005-0.49 g-atom phosphorus per mol of unsaturation in the monomers polymerized,
      <br/>
      in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and
      <br/>
      in the absence of any agents which promote decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to form free radicals, and further, in the absence of any other generator of free radicals, and in the absence of any per salt and/or any other transfer agent.
      <br/>
      More particularly, in the method, all or part of the necessary quantity of the compound containing a phosphorus atom of degree of oxidation less than 5 is introduced into the reaction vessel or into the starting mixture in the reaction vessel, prior to the start of the polymerization, which introduction may occur in the presence of all or part of the monomer(s) which are to undergo polymerization, which monomer(s) if then present may be present as acids or in a partially or completely neutralized state by neutralization with a basic solution.
      <br/>
      Further the method results in the production of homopolymer(s) and/or copolymers without addition of metals or metallic salts, which metals or metallic salts initiate the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In the present method of copolymerization, copolymerization is conducted, regardless of the proportions by weight of the monomers, by introducing into the reaction vessel or into the starting mixture in the reaction vessel, all or part of the quantity of the compound containing a phosphorus atom of degree of oxidation less than 5, which compound is selected from the group consisting of sodium hypophosphite and hypophosphorous acid, the quantity being determined depending on the desired molecular weight of the polymer, and the introduction may be:
      <br/>
      in the presence all or part of the monomer(s) to be polymerized, which monomer(s) if then present may be present as the acids or in a partially or completely neutralized state provided by neutralization with a basic solution, and
      <br/>
      generally in the presence of sufficient added water to obtain a homogeneous solution.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The base used may be sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or lithium hydroxide, which may be added in the form of a solution or as pellets.</p>
    <p num="25">It should be noted that in the present method the expected molecular weight of the copolymer (in the case of manufacture of a copolymer) is not directly a function of the amount of hydrogen peroxide employed, but rather is governed by the relative amount of phosphorus employed and the concentration of the medium.</p>
    <p num="26">
      In the present method when homopolymerizing acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, or maleic acid, homopolymerization is conducted by combining the monomer, the hydrogen peroxide, the compound containing a phosphorus atom of degree of oxidation less than 5, the additional water, and possibly one or more of the abovementioned bases.
      <br/>
      In particular, the following procedure may be used in which the reactor is preheated and is charged with:
      <br/>
      all or part of the total amount of the monomer to be polymerized,
      <br/>
      all or part of the total amount of the compound containing a phosphorus atom which is sodium hypophosphite as hypophosphorous acid, in an amount determined by the desired molecular weight, and
      <br/>
      a quantity of water as needed to prepare a homogeneous solution.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Following this the hydrogen peroxide is injected into the reactor.
      <br/>
      A base comprising one or more of the abovementioned bases is added in a manner and at a time or times such that the injection of the hydrogen peroxide will be in the presence of said base.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Then at the end of the homopolymerization or copolymerization of a reaction duration of preferably 2 hr or less, the copolymer obtained is cooled and then is recovered without further treatment, to be used directly in the form recovered.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The copolymer may also be partially or completely neutralized by one or more neutralizing agents having a monovalent or polyvalent function, e.g. agents selected from the groups consisting of:
      <br/>
      alkali cations, particularly those of sodium and potassium, and also ammonium ion;
      <br/>
      the primary, secondary, or tertiary amines, aliphatic and/or cyclic, e.g. mono-, di-, and triethanolamine, mono- and diethylamine, cyclohexylamine, and methylcyclohexylamine;
      <br/>
      the divalent alkaline earth cations, particularly those of magnesium and calcium, and the divalent zinc cation;
      <br/>
      the trivalent cations, particularly aluminum; certain cations of higher valence; and
      <br/>
      cations of primary and secondary amines, aliphatic and/or cyclical, e.g. cations of monoethylamine, diethylamine, cyclohexylamine, methylcyclohexylamine(s); and combinations thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The polymer may also be treated by any known means to eliminate the water, particularly whereby the polymer is isolated in the form of a fine powder and made use of as said powder.</p>
    <p num="31">The polymers obtained from the present method have a residual monomer content by 300 ppm on the basis of the raw product for each monomer, and the dry matter content is at least 38% regardless of the monomer proportions employed.</p>
    <p num="32">The residual monomer content is determined by an HPLC method with internal standardization, using an HPLC apparatus having a UV and visible light detector enabling operation in the range 180-220 nm, and employing a "Microbondapak" chromatographic column.</p>
    <p num="33">The copolymers intended to be used as milling agents, dispersants, fluidifying agents for drilling fluids, and/or Theological modifiers in detergent formulations of the invention have specific viscosity, defined infra as less than or equal to 10, and preferably less than or equal to 3.</p>
    <p num="34">In the case the present copolymers are intended to be used for treatment of industrial and/or household waters, e.g. to confer anti-scaling and anti-corrosion characteristics, or are intended to be used in the areas of reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration for completing of cations present, the specific viscosities of the copolymers are in the range 0.10 to 10.</p>
    <p num="35">The "specific viscosity" referred to is symbolized by the letter p, and is determined in the following manner:</p>
    <p num="36">
      A solution of the polymer is prepared comprising 2.5 g dry polymer and 50 mL of doubly deionized water.
      <br/>
      Then a capillary viscometer having a Baume constant of 0.000105, operating in a 25 (degree)  C. temperature bath, is used to measure:
      <br/>
      the efflux time of a given volume of said solution containing the copolymer and
      <br/>
      the efflux time of the same volume of doubly de-ionized water, not containing the copolymer.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The specific viscosity  MU  is then defined by the following relation:
      <br/>
      MU =�(efflux time of the polymer solution)-(efflux time of the doubly de-ionized water)� / (efflux time of the doubly de-ionized water).
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      For homopolymers of acrylic acid, the measurement of the specific viscosity is determined by comparison of
      <br/>
      the efflux time of a given volume of a solution of 2.5 g of the corresponding sodium polyacrylate (dry) in 50 mL of a 60 g/L aqueous solution of sodium chloride to
      <br/>
      the efflux time of an equal volume of aqueous sodium chloride solution without the polyacrylate.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The specific viscosity is then given by:
      <br/>
      MU =�(efflux time of the polymer solution)-(efflux time of the NaCl solution) / (efflux time of the NaCl solution).
    </p>
    <p num="40">In both cases the capillary tube is generally chosen such that the efflux time of the doubly deionized water or the NaCl solution without the polymer and/or copolymer is c. 90-100 sec.</p>
    <p num="41">The resulting specific viscosity measurements are very precise.</p>
    <p num="42">
      In practice, a dispersion is prepared from the mineral substance to be dispersed, by introducing said substance into an aqueous solution of the present dispersant which solution has been prepared with agitation.
      <br/>
      The mineral substance may be any of a wide range of materials, e.g.: natural or synthetic calcium carbonate, dolomite, calcium sulfate, titanium dioxide, lamellar pigments such as mica, and/or kaolin, and/or other materials having the characteristic that they must be prepared in suspension and dispersed in order to be utilized in a given application.
      <br/>
      Some of the very diverse areas of application which might be mentioned are: paper coating; pigmentation of paints; ceramics manufacturing; preparation of drilling muds; and preparation and use of detergents.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The mineral substance may be finely comminuted using comminuting bodies, in an aqueous medium containing the milling agent.
      <br/>
      For the fine comminution, an aqueous suspension of the mineral substance is formed wherewith the mineral substance has initial particle size not greater than 50 micron and is present in an amount such that the dry matter content of said suspension is at least 70 wt. %.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The comminuting bodies, advantageously having particle size(s) in the range 0.20 to 4 mm, are added to the suspension of the mineral substance to be comminuted.
      <br/>
      The comminuting bodies are generally in the form of particles of widely diverse materials, e.g. (inter alia):
      <br/>
      silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, or mixtures thereof;
      <br/>
      hard synthetic resins; and
      <br/>
      steels.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      An example of the composition of such comminuting bodies is given in Fr.
      <br/>
      Pat. 2,303,681, which describes comminuting bodies comprised of zirconium oxide in the amount of 30-70 wt. %, aluminum oxide 0.1-5 wt. %, and silicon oxide 5-20 wt. %. The comminuting bodies are added to the suspension in an amount such that, preferably, the ratio between the weight of the comminuting material and the weight of the mineral substance undergoing comminution is at least 2:1, particularly preferably in the range 3:1 to 5:1.
    </p>
    <p num="46">The mixture of the suspension and the comminuting bodies is then subjected to mechanical agitation, of the sort provided in a classical comminuting mill with micro-elements.</p>
    <p num="47">
      The present polymeric milling agent and/or dispersant is also introduced into a mixture comprised of the aqueous suspension of the mineral substances to which the comminuting bodies have been added.
      <br/>
      The amount of the polymer employed is 0.2 to 2 wt. %, based on the dry weight of said polymer and the dry weight of the mineral substance undergoing comminution.
      <br/>
      The time needed to finely comminute the mineral substances varies according to the nature and amount of said mineral substances, the mode of agitation employed, and the temperature of the medium during the comminution.

    <p num="345">
      For each Experiment, the coating slip is prepared by adding to a 1000 mL beaker:
      <br/>
      an amount of water necessary to provide a final concentration of the slip of 68%; and
      <br/>
      an amount of a suspension of calcium carbonate of particle size distribution such that 90% of the particles have a particle size less than 2 micron providing 500 g of calcium carbonate on a dry weight basis.

    <p num="346">After this suspension is formed, the given water retention agent is introduced, under agitation.</p>

      a base piece having an orifice and equipped with a delivery tube through which the filtrate exits, wherein the base piece supports a 60 * 80 mesh metal screen on which a filter paper 90 mm in diameter is placed (Fann reference N 87000100 Box, supplied by Fann Instrument Company);
      <br/>
      a cylinder of 76.2 mm interior diameter and 128 mm height; and
      <br/>
      a cover provided with an inlet for compressed gas, and having a flat gasket to provide a seal between the cover and the cylinder, wherein the gasket is of the same type as those used on the base piece.
    </p>
    <p num="350">
      After 20 min under pressure in the filter, the volume of water collected in a graduated cylinder or the like disposed below the filter body is measured.
