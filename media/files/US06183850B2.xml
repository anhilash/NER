    <p num="2">The present invention relates to target devices for toilets, urinals, or children's potty chairs.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Various types of target devices for toilets or urinals have been employed in the past.
      <br/>
      Such target devices have been found useful in facilitating the toilet training of small children, improving the sanitation in public rest rooms, and as general amusement devices.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Some such target devices are coated with water resistant materials.
      <br/>
      These water resistant materials adversely impact the biodegradability of the target devices and thus are environmentally undesirable.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In addition, a growing problem is the increasing volume of disposable diapers in landfills.
      <br/>
      The diapers are not readily biodegradable and have accumulated at a surprising rate.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Further, many preschool programs require that children be potty trained.
      <br/>
      Thus, it would be helpful for children to be potty trained when they are old enough to benefit from appropriate preschool programs.
    </p>
    <p num="7">It would therefore be desirable to provide a target device which is entertaining, water-dispersible, and easily useable in all types of urinals, toilets, or children's potty chairs.</p>

    <p num="22">Typically the water-dispersible polymers disperse in water in a period of time in the range of from 1 second to 30 minutes, preferably in the range of from 1 second to 20 minutes, and more preferably in the range of from 1 second to 10 minutes.</p>
    <p num="23">
      In a preferred embodiment, the target device comprises a water-dispersible polymer which is biodegradable.
      <br/>
      In an especially preferred embodiment, the water-dispersible polymer at least partially dissolves in water.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable water-soluble polymers include high amylose starch products containing at least 40% by weight amylose, poly(vinyl alcohol), hydroxyethylcellulose, poly(ethylene glycol), and mixtures thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The water-dispersible polymer can be in any suitable form such as film, sheet, or foam.
      <br/>
      Foam products are preferred because of their ease of handling, rigidity, printability and floatability.
      <br/>
      The polymer can contain coloring agents and the target can comprise one or more colors.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The target device can be any desired shape or form.
      <br/>
      If a printed target device is desired, generally the target device will comprise a thin planar element.
      <br/>
      Designs can be created on blank target devices by the individual user.
      <br/>
      If the target devices are printed, the printing can be accomplished by any means known in the art.
      <br/>
      Generally the target device will be free floating.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Typically target devices for children can be prepared in the shape of or printed with animals, including dinosaurs, zoo animals, pets, farm animals, fish, frogs, snakes birds, as well as geometric shapes, rings, fictional characters such as storybook, comic book or cartoon characters, space men, space ships, sun, moon, stars, soldiers, flowers, a bull's-eye, numbers, letters, words, names of children or fictional characters, historic persons, countries, states, continents, boats, trains, cars, trucks, bicycles, tricycles, wagons, toys, combinations thereof or any design of interest to children.
      <br/>
      If the target devices are for adults, the target devices can be printed with political figures, a bull's-eye, or any such design.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Three-dimensional, sculptured or bas-relief, target devices are also within the realm of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Such devices can represent any of the above noted items such as animals including dinosaurs, zoo animals, pets, farm animals, fish, frogs, snakes, birds, as well as geometric shapes, rings, fictional characters such as storybook, comic book or cartoon characters, historic persons, countries, states, continents, space men, space ships, sun, moon, stars, soldiers flowers, political figures, numbers, letters, words, names of children or fictional characters, boats, trains, cars, trucks, bicycles, tricycles, wagons, toys, combinations thereof, or any form of interest.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The size of the target device can vary broadly depending on the particular use.
      <br/>
      Generally, in the case of a planar target device, the size will be in the range of from about 0.1 cm2 to about 400 cm2, preferably from about 1 cm2 to about 300 cm2, and more preferably from 1 cm2 to 250 cm2.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the thickness can vary broadly depending on the particular use and manipulation of the target device.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      For example if the target device is to be printed, the target device should be sufficiently thick to withstand the rigors of the particular printing.
      <br/>
      If the target device is imprinted with a three dimensional effect, the target will be somewhat thicker.
      <br/>
      Generally the target device will have a thickness in the range of from about 1 mm to about 30 mm, preferably from 1 mm to about 25 mm, and more preferably from 1 mm to 20 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Generally, in the case of a three-dimensional target device, the size will be in the range of from abut 1 cc to about 1500 cc, preferably from about 1 cc to about 1000 cc, more preferably from about 1 cc to about 750 cc, and most preferably from 1 cc to 500 cc.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The target device can be prepared by any method known in the art which is appropriate for the material selected.
      <br/>
      For example a predetermined form can be cut from sheet material by means of a scissors, knife or die.
      <br/>
      Forms which are 3-dimensional can be formed by injection molding or other suitable methods.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In one embodiment, the target device contains a fragrance.
      <br/>
      The fragrance can be derived from any material known in the art as long as the fragrance or material containing the fragrance are compatible with the composition of the target device.
      <br/>
      Many such fragrances are commercially available as oils.
      <br/>
      Sources where fragrances can be purchased include Scentastics, Inc., Coral Springs, Fla. and Intercontinental Fragrances, Houston, Tex.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Suitable fragrances include floral, spice, herb, evergreen and various extracts.
      <br/>
      Examples of fragrances include amber, baby powder, bayberry, lilac, cinnamon, coconut, frankincense, gardenia, almond, heather, peach, honey-suckle, jasmine, lily of the valley, myrrh, orange blossom, pine, raspberry, strawberry, rose, vanilla, pineapple, watermelon, peppermint, spearmint, bergamot, sandalwood, cedarwood, cinnamon, sage, clove, geranium, eucalyptus, ginger, grapefruit, lemon, lime, orange, tangerine, rosemary, lavender, and marjoram.
