      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a memory storage disk module adapted for use, for example, in a computer memory unit, and including at least one memory storage disk and at least one head able to access the storage disk.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Memory storage disk systems, including memory storage disks such as magnetic disks or optical disks, are widely used as external memories of computers.
      <br/>
      In such a system, a plurality of magnetic disks and cooperating magnetic heads are hermetically housed in a housing, to thus constitute a memory storage disk unit as is well known and disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,899,237. The magnetic heads are carried by movable arms or the like and are capable of a selective access to a desired magnetic disk.
      <br/>
      Usually, a control circuit board is attached to the memory storage disk unit, and the memory storage disk unit and the control circuit board constitute a memory storage disk module.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A memory storage disk system of the large computer system comprises a plurality of such memory storage disk modules accommodated in a rack or a cabinet, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,754,397. This patent also discloses power supply units arranged in the cabinet at a lower position thereof.
      <br/>
      Each module is carried by a drawer slidably accommodated in each shelf of a cabinet.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 62-239394 also discloses a memory storage disk system comprising a plurality of memory storage disk modules and power supply units accommodated in a rack or a cabinet.
      <br/>
      In this publication, each memory storage disk and a cooling fan are housed in a duct-like drawer slidably accommodated in the rack or cabinet.
      <br/>
      As a cooling fan is provided in the duct-like drawer of each module, the cooling capability for each module can be greatly improved in this memory storage disk system.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Many countries have standards requiring a reduction of electromagnetic noise radiated externally from an electric or electronic device, and to satisfy these standards, manufacturers of memory storage disk systems often provide shields for preventing an emission of electromagnetic waves from the memory storage disk module and associated control circuit board in the rack or cabinet of the electric or electronic device, externally of the rack or cabinet.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the rack or cabinet for these systems must be made extra large, and thus costly, and accordingly, attempts are being made to produce a rack or cabinet in a smaller and more simple form, to thereby reduce the cost of manufacturing same.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there is a need for a rack or cabinet that can be made easily and cheaply, even if each memory storage disk module is a shielded against radiation thereby of electromagnetic waves.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Also, manufacturers of such systems wish to facilitate the assembly work of the memory storage disk system, and accordingly, there is a need for a memory storage disk module having features that will allow manufacturers of these systems to make the rack or cabinet in a more simple manner.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">The object of the present invention to provide a memory storage disk module having a good cooling capacity.</p>
    <p num="11">Another object of the present invention to provide a memory storage disk module having a shield against radiation of electromagnetic waves therefrom sufficient to reduce noise radiated externally from an electric or electronic device to which the memory storage disk module is to be mounted.</p>
    <p num="12">The object of the present invention to provide a memory storage disk module having a good cooling capacity and a shield against radiation of electromagnetic waves therefrom sufficient to reduce noise radiated externally from an electric or electronic device to which the memory storage disk module is to be mounted.</p>
    <p num="13">Another object of the present invention is to provide a memory storage disk module having a good cooling capacity and shielded against an emission thereby of electromagnetic waves, and allowing an electric or electronic device to which the memory storage disk module is to be mounted to have a simple design.</p>
    <p num="14">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a memory storage disk module having a good cooling capacity and shielded against an emission thereby of electromagnetic waves, and including a power supply means incorporated therein to thereby allow simple design and easy assembly of an electric or electronic device to which the memory storage disk module is to be mounted.</p>
    <p num="15">A further object of the present invention is to provide a memory storage disk module having a good cooling capacity and shielded against an emission thereby of electromagnetic waves and including a plug-in connector means incorporated therein, to thereby allow simple design and easy assembly of an electric or electronic device to which the memory storage disk module is to be mounted.</p>
    <p num="16">According to the present invention, there is provided a memory storage disk module comprising a memory storage disk unit including at least one memory storage disk, and at least one head able to access the disk for writing and reading data to and from disk, a control circuit board attached to the memory storage disk unit and including a control circuit for controlling the disk and the head, and cover means covering at least the memory storage disk unit and the control circuit board for shielding an emission of electromagnetic waves from at least the control circuit board, the cover means having a longitudinal axis, a main panel portion extending generally along and around the longitudinal axis and having opposite ends, a front panel located on the main panel portion at one end thereof, and a rear panel portion located on the main panel portion at the other end thereof, the main panel portion being substantially solid and the front and rear panel portions having small apertures, respectively, allowing air to flow therethrough.</p>
    <p num="17">
      According to the present invention, the cover means is made from a metal able to provide a shield against an emission of electromagnetic waves.
      <br/>
      The main panel portion of the cover means extends along the longitudinal axis and around the longitudinal axis, to thereby constitute a duct-like cover allowing a flow of cooling air over the memory storage disk unit and the control circuit board.
      <br/>
      The main panel portion is solid, i.e., there are no significant openings in the wall of the main panel portion constituting the shield.
      <br/>
      The front and rear panel portions have small apertures, respectively, allowing air to flow therethrough, but these small apertures must have a size and be arranged such that the front and rear panel portions also provide a shielding effect, respectively, to satisfy the relevant regulations imposed in many countries.
