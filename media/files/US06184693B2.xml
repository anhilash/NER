      A first substrate having a first electromagnetic noise sensor on its surface perpendicularly intersects with a second substrate having a second electromagnetic noise sensor on its surface, making up an integral structure.
      <br/>
      A first induced voltage value output from the first electromagnetic sensor at a position thereof directly before driving by a driving means is recorded, and a second induced voltage value output from the second electromagnetic noise sensor at a position thereof at a time of movement of the integral structure for only a predetermined distance by a driving means is recorded.

      Based on the recorded first and second voltage values, an electromagnetic noise level in a vicinity of the integral substrate is determined.
      <br/>
      The first and second induced voltage values are compared, and based on comparison of the first and second induced voltage values, and whether a larger voltage value from among the first and second voltage values is larger than the third voltage value, a direction of an electromagnetic noise generating source in the vicinity of the integral substrate is computationally determined.

      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1.
      <br/>
      FIELD OF THE INVENTION
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention concerns an electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus for measuring electromagnetic noise generated from a concerned electromagnetic noise measurement body under operation, for example, a printed circuit board.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In electrical devices, as represented by computers having a clock frequency exceeding 100 MHz, digitalization of such electrical devices and high speed operation thereof is progressing.
      <br/>
      Because high frequency noise is generated, including successive even and odd numbers from binary digital signals therefrom, an electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus covering the GHz band has been desired.
    </p>
    <p num="5">As types of electromagnetic noise measurement apparatuses for measuring electromagnetic noise, there are for example, the disclosures of Japanese Patent publication No. 5-67184, Japanese Laid-Open Patent publication No. 6-58969 and Japanese Laid-Open Patent publication No. 6-58970. In Japanese Patent publication No. 5-67184, an antenna made up of a wire which generates an electrical output corresponding to electromagnetic radiation from an electromagnetic radiating body is disposed in proximity to the electromagnetic radiating body, the output from the antenna is sequentially selected by a diode matrix and transmitted to a measurement receiving device, the electromagnetic radiation level is analyzed by the measurement signal receiving device, and a mapping showing electromagnetic radiation levels at positions confronting the antenna in the vicinity of the electromagnetic radiating body is generated from the analyzed measured electromagnetic radiation levels.</p>
    <p num="6">On the other hand, in the disclosures of Japanese Laid-Open Patent publication Nos. 6-58969 and 6-58970, a near magnetic field probe is caused to confront a printed circuit board which is installed in an electrical device emitting much unnecessary radiation, the near magnetic field probe is moved in X-Y-Z axial directions with respect to the printed circuit board, and electromagnetic noise is measured based on an output from the near magnetic field probe.</p>
    <p num="7">Further, in the disclosure of Japanese Laid-Open Patent publication No. 6-58970, a printed circuit board disposed in an electrical device is placed on an antenna for measuring interference, wherein measurements including electromagnetic noise of surfaces of the printed circuit board are made.</p>
    <p num="8">On the other hand, as an interference measuring antenna for detecting a magnetic field of unnecessary radiation, there is the disclosure of Japanese Laid-Open Patent publication No. 6-58971. This interference measurement antenna is made up of a multi-turn coil which is connected in series to a coil constructed as a pattern in the same position atop a multi-layer printed circuit board, wherein a surface-installed condenser is made internal with the printed circuit board, the multi-turn coil and condenser are connected, and an LC resonant circuit is arranged as a matrix on the printed circuit board.</p>
    <p num="9">Notwithstanding, apart from the problem that in the measurement of electromagnetic noise by the electromagnetic noise measurement apparatuses of the above-mentioned prior art, measurement of electromagnetic noise covering the GHz band is problematic, there is also the problem that an antenna must be arranged at a predetermined interval in a plane which is wider than the area of the concerned electromagnetic noise measurement body under operation.</p>
    <p num="10">Furthermore, because the antenna is arranged in a plane, a distance-based measurement interval is fixed by the distance from the antenna, and measurement resolution cannot be made small.</p>
    <p num="11">Still further, the antenna cannot capture, as a near magnetic field, a current which flows through an electronic circuit.</p>
    <p num="12">Further, in the disclosures of Laid-Open Patent publication Nos. 6-58969 and 6-58970, because measurements are made while driving the near magnetic field probe in X-Y-Z axial directions, in spite of the fact that the time of electrical measurement is shortened, time is required for mechanical movement of the near magnetic field probe, and there is the problem that high speed measurement is difficult.</p>
    <p num="13">Further, in the measurement of electromagnetic noise by the electromagnetic noise measurement apparatuses of the above-mentioned prior art, because a drive motor for moving the near magnetic field probe is always operated, elimination of electromagnetic noise due to the motor becomes necessary and the motor must be distanced from the near magnetic field probe, also resulting in the problem that the apparatus becomes increased in complexity.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Further, when using the interference measurement antenna of the above-mentioned prior art, there is the problem that only electromagnetic noise of a narrow frequency band, in which sensitivity is improved by constructing a resonant circuit, can be measured.
      <br/>
      For widening the frequency band, it becomes necessary to raise the resonant frequency, however when made small in size with a few MHz frequency band, there is the problem that the sensitivity thereof is diminished.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Furthermore, when using the interference measuring antenna of the above-noted prior art, when the coil number is increased the antenna surface shields the measured electromagnetic noise of concern, and there is also a problem that the direction of the magnetic field components which make up the electromagnetic noise are bent and accurate measurement thereof cannot be conducted.</p>
    <p num="16">Moreover, in the electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus of the prior art, apart from electromagnetic noise levels, such apparatuses cannot enable measurement together with measuring the direction of generation of the electromagnetic source.</p>
    <heading>OUTLINE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">A first object of the present invention is to provide an electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus which can take measurements in a wide band GHz range, further wherein accurate measurement of electromagnetic noise levels, combined with direction of the electromagnetic noise generating source, can be performed, and wherein electromagnetic noise levels and the electromagnetic noise generating source can be specified.</p>
    <p num="18">A second object of the present invention is to provide an electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus in which resolution of the electromagnetic noise measurement is increased.</p>
    <p num="19">A third object of the present invention is to provide an electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus in which the electromagnetic noise levels and direction of the electromagnetic noise generating source can be rapidly measured.</p>
    <p num="20">The above and other objects, characteristics and advantages shall be made more clear from the attached figures and accompanying descriptions of the following preferred embodiments.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="22">Below, preferred embodiments of the electromagnetic noise sensor in accordance with the present invention shall be presented, the below detailed description thereof being explained with reference to the attached drawings.</p>
    <p num="23">FIG. 1 is an outline structural view of an electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention, wherein an example of a case in which a two-dimensional planar electromagnetic noise is measured shall be described.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus 1 comprises a base substrate 3 having disposed upright on a first surface thereof an electromagnetic noise sensor EN1 formed from a coil array, and further on a back surface thereof a switch circuit group 2 made up of switches 2a, 2b, . . . (refer to FIG. 6) which separately and selectively deliver out an output from a coil corresponding to coils of the electromagnetic noise sensor EN1, and which constitute the electromagnetic noise sensor EN1; a base substrate driving device 4 for driving the base substrate in Y-axis and X-axis directions; a signal conversion device 5 made up, for example, of a spectral analyzer or network analyzer which constitutes an interface which converts an induced voltage output, via the switching circuit group 2, from the electromagnetic noise sensor EN1, to a signal capable of being read-in by a control circuit 6; a RAM 7 operating cooperatively with the control circuit; and a display device 8 for displaying an electromagnetic noise level and a direction based on the output from the control circuit 6.
      <br/>
      Further, in FIG. 1, in order to better describe the switching circuit group 2, it is shown as being spaced apart from the base substrate 3.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The switches which constitute the switch group 2 disposed on the back surface of the base substrate 3 correspond to each coil making up the electromagnetic noise sensor EN1, and further are constituted by relays which deliver out separately and selectively an evoked voltage from its corresponding coil.
      <br/>
      Herein, the relays which make up the switches are wide band mechanical relays set at a characteristic impedance of 50  OMEGA .
      <br/>
      Such relays are used because the OFF resistance thereof is substantially infinite.
      <br/>
      When a slight decrease concerning OFF resistance is acceptable, in place of mechanical relays, diode switching circuits may also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="26">The control apparatus 6, to be discussed later, comprises a drive pulse generating means 61, a switching signal generating means 62, a calculating means 63 and a display control means 64.</p>
    <p num="27">The reason for use of the signal conversion device 5 is so that the frequency of the induced voltages output from the coils making up the electromagnetic noise sensor EN1 are frequencies in the GHz band, and so that the high voltage of such frequencies is converted to a signal capable of being read by the control circuit 6.</p>
    <p num="28">Further, at least the base substrate 3, the base substrate driving device 4, the control circuit 6 and RAM 7 are disposed in a casing 10 of the electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus 1.</p>
    <p num="29">
      With the electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus 1 of the first embodiment, a concerned electromagnetic noise measurement device to be tested which generates electromagnetic noise, for example an electronic device of a printed circuit board while under operation, is placed on an upper surface of the casing 10 of the electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus 1, wherein a frosted glass substrate 9 is provided as a placement substrate for the electromagnetic noise measurement device to be tested.
      <br/>
      In place of frosted glass substrate 9, a substrate formed of an acrylic resin, for example, may also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The base substrate 3 is disposed at a fixed interval separation from, and so as to confront, a back surface of the frosted glass plate 9.</p>
    <p num="31">In the electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus 1 of the first embodiment of the present invention, the effective area of the frosted glass plate 9 is made JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) A4 in size.</p>
    <p num="32">
      The electromagnetic noise sensor EN1 is constructed on a surface of the base substrate 3 which faces the back surface of the frosted glass plate 9, as shown in plan view in FIG. 2A and perspective view in FIG. 2B. In the first embodiment, for the electromagnetic noise sensor EN1 a dielectric substrate 31, for example a Teflon substrate or glass epoxy substrate, is disposed upright on a surface of the based substrate 3.
      <br/>
      Coils 32a, 32b, . . . 32n are formed, separated at fixed intervals mutually on front and rear surfaces of the dielectric substrate 31, and dielectric substrates 33a, 33b, . . . 33n are separately disposed perpendicularly at central positions of the coils 32a, 32b, . . . 32n on an opposite side surface of the dielectric substrate 31, opposite to a surface of the dielectric substrate 31 which has the coils 32a, 32b, . . . 32n formed thereon.
      <br/>
      Coils 34a, 34b, . . . 34n are formed on one surface of the dielectric substrates 33a, 33b, . . . 33n, wherein an electromagnetic noise sensor EN1 is made up from the dielectric substrates 31 and 33a, 33b, . . . 33n and coils 32a, 32b, . . . 33n and 34a, 34b, . . . 34n.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In this manner, the coils 32a, 32b, . . . 32n are arranged on the base substrate 3 along the X-axis direction, wherein Y-axis direction noise components, in particular Y-axis direction magnetic field components to be discussed hereinafter, are detected.
      <br/>
      The coils 34a, 34b, . . . 34n are arranged along the Y-axis direction on the base substrate 3, wherein X-axis direction electromagnetic noise components, in particular X-axis magnetic field components to be discussed hereinafter, are detected.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Furthermore, to exemplify the relative positioning of the paired coils 32a and 34a, they are as shown in the perspective view of FIG. 3A.</p>
    <p num="35">FIGS. 3B, 3C, 4A and 4B are explanatory views for determining the electromagnetic noise levels and direction of an electromagnetic noise generating source from coils 32a and 34a, wherein to facilitate explanation, the coils 32a and 34a are shown as typical views.</p>
    <p num="36">Herein, a distance AL is defined to be a distance from the surface position of coils 32a, . . . , 32n to a center position A0 of each of corresponding coils 34a, . . . , 34n. Coils 32a, . . . , 32n and 34a, . . . , 34n are formed with a uniform coil winding direction, and are arranged so as to output a positive induced voltage with respect to coordinates determined by the dielectric substrates 31 and 33a, . . . , 33n, and with respect to a magnetic field from a first quadrant side.</p>
    <p num="37">
      When a magnetic field generated by a high frequency current flowing through an electronic circuit of an electromagnetic measurement device under test exists in the vicinity of the dielectric substrate 31, a voltage is induced in the coils 32a, . . . , 32n and 34a, . . . , 34n by the magnetic field.
      <br/>
      The induced voltage values output based on the induced voltage from coils 32a, . . . , 32n and 34a, . . . , 34n are stored respectively in RAM 7.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The induced voltage values from coils 32a and 34a, when at the position of the dielectric substrates 31 and 33a shown in FIG. 3B, are stored in RAM 7.
      <br/>
      The induced voltage value from the coil 34a is defined as (.vertline.VX1.vertline.).
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Herein, because the frequency of induced voltages from the coils 32a, 34a are in the GHz band, and a signal conversion is performed by a signal conversion device, such as a spectral analyzer which acts as an interface, and are then read in, the instantaneous polarity thereof is unclear.
      <br/>
      As a result, for convenience, absolute value symbols .vertline..vertline. are applied and shown.
      <br/>
      Such symbols shall be used similarly throughout the following descriptions.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Next, as illustrated in typical view in FIG. 3C, the dielectric substrates 31 and 33a are moved only a distance AL from the position of FIG. 3B in the Y-axis direction, an induced voltage value output from coils 32a and 34a at the position shown in FIG. 3C is stored in RAM 7, and then the coils 32a and 34a are put in parallel connection, and an induced voltage value in the parallel connected state is stored in RAM 7.
      <br/>
      The induced voltage value from the coil 32a is defined as (.vertline.Vy2.vertline.) and the induced voltage value when in a parallel connected state is defined as (.vertline.Vp2.vertline.).
    </p>
    <p num="41">Following storage of the induced voltage values in RAM 7, an induced voltage value (.vertline.Vx1.vertline.) from the coil 34a, which is stored when at the condition shown in FIG. 3B, and an induced voltage value (.vertline.Vy2.vertline.) from the coil 32a which is stored when at the condition shown in FIG. 3C, are read out from a memory, and calculations of the following equations (1) and (2) are performed.</p>

      Although the magnetic field strength is determinable from equation (1), as stated previously, because the instantaneous polarity of the induced voltage is unclear, it cannot be decided at that time from equation (2) inside of which four quadrants the magnetic field direction is.
      <br/>
      Next, an explanation shall be given of the induced voltage value (.vertline.Vp2.vertline.).
    </p>
    <p num="47">The induced voltage value which is detected by parallel connecting coils 32a and 34a at the position of FIG. 3C, wherein the internal impedance of coils 32a and 34a are set to be roughly equal, is an induced voltage value which is determined based on the polarities at respective instants of the induced voltage of coil 32a and the induced voltage of coil 34a, wherein (.vertline.Vp2.vertline.) is roughly equal to (.vertline.Vx2 +Vy2.vertline.).</p>
    <p num="48">
      Next, the larger value among the induced voltage values (.vertline.Vy2.vertline.) and (.vertline.Vx2.vertline.) is selected, and it is checked whether the induced voltage value (.vertline.Vp2.vertline.) is larger than the larger of the former two voltages.
      <br/>
      Based on this check, when it is discerned that the induced voltage value (.vertline.Vp2.vertline.) is larger than the one discerned to be the larger of the induced voltage values (i.e. the larger of .vertline.Vy2.vertline. and .vertline.Vx2.vertline.), the value of the calculation result of equation (2) is taken as the magnetic field direction.
      <br/>
      When it is discerned, in the above-described check, that the induced voltage value (.vertline.Vp2.vertline.) is not larger than the one discerned to be the larger of the induced voltage values (i.e. the larger of .vertline.Vy2.vertline. and .vertline.Vx2.vertline.), a value taken by adding 90 degrees to the calculation result of equation (2) is taken as the magnetic field direction.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 4B, the magnetic field strength G and magnetic field direction can be determined.
      <br/>
      The broken line in FIG. 4B shows a case in which the magnetic field generation point is in the second quadrant.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      This feature shall be described more fully.
      <br/>
      As for the induced voltage value (Vp2), when coils 32a and 34a are connected in parallel, in the case that the magnetic field is received from the first or third quadrants, the induced voltage value (Vy2) from coil 32a and the induced voltage value (Vx2) from coil 34a are of the same polarity, and (Vp2) becomes an induced voltage value by adding voltage value (VYy2) and voltage value (Vx2); and in the case that the magnetic field is received from the second or fourth quadrants, the induced voltage value (Vy2) from coil 32a and the induced voltage value (Vx2) from coil 34a are of different polarity, and (Vp2) becomes an induced voltage value by subtracting induced voltage value (Vy2) from induced voltage value (Vx2).
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Accordingly, when the larger among the induced voltage value (.vertline.Vy2.vertline.) and induced voltage value (.vertline.Vx2.vertline.) is selected, and the induced voltage value (.vertline.Vp2.vertline.) is greater than the larger of the induced voltage values, this implies an addition, and it is discerned that the magnetic field direction is from the first or third quadrant.
      <br/>
      When the larger amount the induced voltage value (.vertline.Vy2.vertline.) and induced voltage value (.vertline.Vx2.vertline.) is selected, yet the induced voltage value (.vertline.Vp2.vertline.) is not greater than the larger of the induced voltage values, this implies a subtraction and it is discerned that the magnetic field direction is from the second or fourth quadrant.
      <br/>
      As a result, the magnetic field direction can be easily detected.

    <p num="51">Further, in the above, paired coils 32a and 34a have been explained, however the situation is the same in the case of the other paired coils 32b and 34b, 32n and 34n.</p>
    <p num="52">The respective coils 32a, 32b, . . . , 32n, 34a, 34b, . . . , 34n are constructed, for example, by shielded loop coils SC, as shown by the partial broken sectional view of FIG. 5.</p>
    <p num="53">In each of respective coils 32a, . . . , 32n, 34a, . . . , 34n which are constructed as shielded loop coils SC, a through hole 16 is disposed substantially centrally, and further a notch Gp which communicates the through hole 16 to the outside is disposed, and dielectric substrates 12-1 and 12-2 formed by substantially C-shaped Teflon plates or glass-epoxy resin plates or the like are stacked in relative confronting relation with their mutual through holes 16 and notches Gp in conformity; ground conductors 13-1 and 13-2 are separately formed on outer surfaces of the respective dielectric substrates 12-1 and 12-2; a fixed position interposed by the through hole 16 and opposing the notch GP is taken as a starting terminal position P, and a fixed position on one semicircular C-shaped part is taken as an end terminal position E, wherein the ground conductors 13-1 and 13-2, at the starting terminal position P, are electrically connected to the outer conductor of a co-axial cable 15; a roughly half-turn strip conductor 14, having a characteristic impedance set at 50  OMEGA , is formed on an inner surface of one dielectric substrate 12-1 from the starting terminal position P along the other C-shaped semicircular part, and across the notch GP and along the one C-shaped semicircular part until reaching the end terminal position E; the respective ground conductors 13-1 and 13-2 are electrically connected with the strip conductor 14 at the end terminal position E, and the starting terminal position P side of the strip conductor 14 is electrically connected to the inner conductor of coaxial cable 15, wherein an induced voltage between the strip conductor 14 and ground conductors 13-1 and 13-2 is taken out and delivered to a switch of the switching circuit group 2.</p>
    <p num="54">
      As a result of the fact that the respective coils 32a, . . . , 32n, 34a, . . . , 34n are constructed as shielded loop coils SC as described above, the strip conductor 14 is gripped in a sandwiched state by the ground conductors 13-1 and 13-2, is shielded from external electric fields and does not receive effects from external electric fields.
      <br/>
      Further, because the respective ground conductor surfaces of the ground conductors 13-1 and 13-2 are in upper/lower symmetry with respect to a line connecting the notch GP and starting terminal position P of the strip conductor 14, induced voltages from electric fields are differentially suppressed, such induced voltages by electric fields are negated, and induced voltages caused primarily by magnetic fields are taken out from the coils 32a, . . . , 32n, 34a, . . . , 34n, and further the range of measuring frequency can cover up to 2 GHz.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In this way, according to the first embodiment, shielded loop coils SC are used for the coils 32a, 32n, 34a, . . . , 34n, and since electromagnetic noise is caused to be detected by the shielded loop coils SC, electric field components are negated by such shielded loop coils SC, and electric field components are not detected thereby, wherein only magnetic field components caused by changes in electric current changes in an electronic circuit which is the object of measurement are detected.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, magnetic fields generated by currents flowing in the electronic circuit, which is the object of measurement, are detected.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      In contrast to this, when detecting electromagnetic noise by an antenna, the electromagnetic waves as a result magnetic fields, namely combined electric fields and magnetic fields, are detected.

      <br/>
      However, with the first embodiment, because shielded loop coils SC are disposed perpendicularly, such directivity does not cause any problem.

    <p num="57">Further, in the shielded loop coils SC, even if the dielectric substrates 12-1 and 12-2 do not have through holes 16, and are formed in a state without through holes 16, this does not interfere in terms of the characteristics thereof.</p>

    <p num="61">The base substrate 3, having disposed thereon the electromagnetic noise sensor EN1, is affixed through spacers 54 on a surface side of the Y-axis direction moving table 53, so that the Y-axis direction moving table 53 and the switch circuit group 2 do not abut each other.</p>
    <p num="62">As a result of structuring the base substrate moving apparatus 4 as described above, the base substrate 3 is driven in the Y-axis direction, in a state having the electromagnetic noise sensor EN1 installed thereon, in accordance with driving of the Y-axis direction moving pulse motor 48, and the base substrate 3 is driven in the X-axis direction, in a state in which the electromagnetic noise sensor EN1 is installed thereon, by driving of the X-axis direction driving pulse motor 42.</p>
    <p num="63">The control circuit 6 is formed by a microcomputer, and is functionally equipped by a drive pulse generating means 61 outputting a driving pulse for driving the X-axis direction driving pulse motor 42 and a Y-axis direction driving pulse for driving the Y-axis direction driving pulse motor 48; a switching signal generating means 62 for delivering out a switching signal to the switch circuit group 2, for successively and selectively conveying out an induced voltage signals from each of the coils; a calculating means 6 for determining, by calculation, a magnetic field strength and magnetic field direction based on the induced voltage values output by the coils; and a display control means 64 for displaying on a display means 8 the magnetic field strength and magnetic field direction corresponding to a position above the region of measurement.</p>
    <p num="64">Operation of the electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus 1 of the first embodiment, constructed as described above, shall be explained based on the flow chart of FIG. 7.</p>
    <p num="65">When the electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus 1 is operated in a state in which a magnetic field generating body, for example an electronic device during operation thereof, is placed on the frosted glass plate 9, the base substrate 3 having the electromagnetic noise sensor EN1 installed thereon is moved to a previously determined origin point in accordance with driving pulses output from the X-axis direction driving pulse motor 42 and Y-axis direction driving pulse motor 48, and an initial setting for the number of times of movement thereof, N=1, is made (Step S1).</p>

    <p num="71">
      Following Step S6, the induced voltages stored in RAM 7 area F(N) are read out, sizes of the induced voltage values from paired coils 32a and 34a, coils 32b and 34b, . . . coils 32n and 34n, which are the stored content of RAM 7 areas D(N) and E(N), are compared, and it is checked whether the induced voltage value which is the stored content of RAM 7 area F(N), in which induced voltage values at a time when the paired coils are parallel connected are stored, is greater than the larger of the previously compared voltage values (Step S7).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, such a check is performed with respect to each of the respective plural pairs.
      <br/>
      Herein, in Step S7 of FIG. 7, the statement "D(N) and E(N)" implies the selected larger item from among the stored content of area D(N) and the stored content of area E(N).

      The display, for example, performs a display of length on the display device 8 based on a magnetic field direction An(N) and a magnetic field strength G(N), at a display position corresponding to each of paired coils 32a and 34a.

    <p num="78">Further, the coils which constitute the electromagnetic noise sensor EN1 are disposed as pairs which, on the one hand, are disposed in an X-axis direction and, on the other hand, in the Y-axis direction, and because the base substrate 3, having disposed thereon paired plural coils, is driving by pulse motors, compared to the case of an antenna disposed on a planar measurement surface, the number of coils making up the electromagnetic noise sensor EN1 can be made less, and in addition the base substrate 3 can be moved an interval of for example 0.1 mm, wherein in terms of distance, a measurement interval can be set at an interval of 0.1 mm.</p>

    <p num="100">The control circuit 6A comprises a microcomputer, and is functionally equipped by a drive pulse generating means 61A outputting driving pulses for driving the X-axis direction driving pulse motor 42 and Y-axis direction driving pulses for driving the Y-axis direction drive pulse motor 48; a switching signal generating means 62A for transmitting switching signals to switches 2a, 2b, . . . of the switch circuit group 2A, which serve to derive selectively and sequentially induced voltages from coils 361 to 3696 which constitute the electromagnetic noise sensor EN2; a calculating means 63A for determining an electromagnetic noise level and a direction of the electromagnetic noise generating source, based on induced voltages output from the coils 361 to 3696 making up the electromagnetic noise sensor EN2; and a display control means 64A for displaying on a display device 8 the electromagnetic noise level and direction of the electromagnetic noise generating source determined by the calculating means 63A corresponding to a position above a region of measurement.</p>
    <p num="101">Operation of the electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus 1A of the second embodiment of the present invention, constructed as described above, shall be explained based on FIG. 12 through FIG. 16C.</p>
    <p num="102">Under a condition in which a concerned electromagnetic noise measurement device under test, for example a computer printed circuit board or the like while under operation, is placed on the frosted glass plate 9, when the electromagnetic noise measurement apparatus 1A according to the second embodiment of the present invention is operated, the X-axis direction driving pulse motor 42 and the Y-axis direction driving pulse motor 48 are driven by drive pulses output from the drive pulse generating means 61A, wherein the base substrate 3A is moved to a predetermined origin position, for example, until an end position of the coils 361 to 3624 of the first electromagnetic noise sensor row EN2f reaches a lower end position of an A4 sized region, and a line of extension from a left end position of the coil 3649 on the left end of the third electromagnetic noise sensor row EN2h is positioned along a left end of the A4 sized region (Step S21).</p>
    <p num="103">After positioning at the above-mentioned origin position, the base substrate 3A is moved sequentially in the Y-axis direction, wherein a measurement range is from where the coils 3673 to 3696 of the fourth electromagnetic noise sensor row EN2i extend outside of an upper end side of the A4 sized region.</p>
    <p num="104">
      When the base substrate 3A is moved to the origin position, following Step S21, the maximum number of shift times in the Y-axis direction (N=Ymax / a+3) is determined (Step S22).

      Herein, Ymax indicates the length in the Y-axis direction which, in the case of an A4 size, is 210 mm, a is the distance of the center interval of adjacent coils in the Y-axis direction, and "3" is a value so that the coils 3673 to 3696 of the fourth electromagnetic noise sensor row EN2i can measure inside an upper end of the measurement region.
      <br/>
      When the quotient of Ymax / a is not an integer, the quotient is made .left brkt-top.Ymax / a.right brkt-bot.+1 wherein the symbols .left brkt-top..right brkt-bot. indicate gauss's notations.

      Following step 22, the Y-axis direction shift number n is set at n=1 (Step S23) and next the coil number m of coils making up the electromagnetic noise sensor EN2 is set at 1 (Step S24).

      Herein, the coil number m of coils constituting the electromagnetic noise sensor EN2, at a maximum, is m=92 (24 of each row of electromagnetic noise sensors X 4 rows) Following Step S24, it is checked whether the mth electromagnetic noise sensor EN is positioned inside of the measurement region or not (Step S25), and when it is discerned that the mth electromagnetic noise sensor EN is positioned inside the measurement region, following Step S25, the switch 2 m of switch group 2A corresponding to the mth coil 36m (m=1 to 96) is placed in an ON state by a switching signal output from the switching signal generation means 62A, and the induced voltage of the mth coil 36m is measured (Step S26).

    <p num="106">
      Following Step S26, it is checked whether or not measurement data is already stored in the RAM 7 address position corresponding to the position inside the region of the mth coil 36m (Step S27).

      In Step S27, as discussed below, with respect to induced voltages from coils of the odd-numbered electromagnetic noise sensor rows EN2f, EN2h, it is discerned that the measurement data is not already stored in Step S26, and with respect to induced voltages from the sensors of even-numbered electromagnetic noise sensor rows EN2g, EN2i, it is discerned that the measurement data is already stored in Step S26.

    <p num="107">
      When the mth coil 36m is a coil of an odd numbered electromagnetic row (EN2f, EN2h), the induced voltage output from the mth coil 36m is stored as measurement data at an address position of RAM 7 corresponding to a position of the mth coil (Step S28), and next, m is incremented (m=m+1) (Step S29).
      <br/>
      Next, it is checked whether or not m is 96 or less (Step S30).
      <br/>
      The execution of Step S30 is for checking whether or not Steps S25 through S29 have been effected across all coils.

      During execution of these repeated steps, when m reaches m=25, at that condition, because the mth coil 36m does not enter inside of the measurement region in Step S25, steps S26 to S28 are skipped, and Step 29 is immediately executed after Step S25.
      <br/>
      Direct execution of Step S29 after Step S25 is performed from the 25th coil 3625 until reaching coil 3696.

      When it is discerned that n is N or less in Step S32, namely when it is discerned that coils 3673 through 3696 of the fourth electromagnetic noise sensor row EN2i are not projecting outside of the measurement region, the Y-axis direction pulse motor 48 is driven in accordance with a driving pulse output from the drive pulse generating means 61A, and the base substrate 3A is driven only a distance a in the Y-axis direction (Step S33), and thereafter the steps from Step S24 onward are repeated.
