    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a heat pack, and more particularly to a heat pack which is provided with a coil type trigger.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">There are provided various kinds of heat packs in accordance with a shape of a trigger which is operated in a supersaturated solution of the heat pack.</p>
    <p num="5">
      As an example of the heat pack, U.S. Pat. No. 5,205,278 discloses a chemical bag warmer comprising a sealed bag which is made of PVC, P.P, P.U. plastic and in which a sodium acetate solution is filled, and a triggering member which is mounted in the sodium acetate and generates an oscillation wave effect in the sodium acetate solution.
      <br/>
      The triggering member is a disc-shaped member, of which the center portion is a cross-shaped part extended to the edge thereof to divide the center portion into four sectors; each sector has a plurality of fragmental concentric circles to form into a rugged surface, the rugged surface can facilitate the triggering member to bend and vibrate so as to generate the better oscillation wave effect.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Further, U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,110 discloses an activator for initiating crystallization of a supersaturated solution within a flexible container.
      <br/>
      The activator comprises a flexible screen for immersing in the supersaturated solution within the flexible container.
      <br/>
      The flexible screen defines a plurality of apertures therein with an activation material being affixed to the screen within the plurality of apertures.
      <br/>
      Upon flexing of the flexible screen by an operator, the activation material interacts with the screen to initiate crystallization of the supersaturated solution.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 4,829,980, there is disclosed a trigger device for a heat pack comprises three helically-coiled, resilient metallic filaments 1,2,3 nested one within the other and of inwardly decreasing diameter, the filament 2 is wound in a sense opposite to that of filaments 1 and 3.
      <br/>
      Flexing the assembly of nested helices about its longitudinal axes produces a rubbing action between adjacent turns thereof which initiates crystallization.
      <br/>
      Other devices comprises two nested helices wound in the same sense; a single helix having a pressure plate at one end and an external or internal cap at the other; and a body of randomly convoluted or woven metallic filament.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      However, in case of the U.S. Pat. No. 5,205,278 among the constructions of the triggers of the conventional heat packs, as described above, since the triggering member is a flexible metallic piece having the disc-shape, the triggering member may be damaged, when being repeatedly used over a long time.
      <br/>
      In addition, in case of the flexible screen of the U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,110, such problem may be seriously raised.
    </p>

      Meanwhile, in case of the U.S. Pat. No. 4,829,980, there should be provided a process of nesting a plurality of filaments in order to manufacture the trigger.
      <br/>
      This makes the manufacturing process complex.
      <br/>
      Also, in case of the single helix, the single helix has to have a pressure plate at one end and an external or internal cap at the other.
      <br/>
      Therefore, since there should be provided further process of mounting the pressure plate and cap, there is a difficulty in the manufacturing process.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      And in case of the trigger in which two or more filaments are nested, since the plurality of the filaments have to be bent in order to crystallize the supersaturated solution, there is a problem that it is too hard for a user to operate the trigger.
      <br/>
      In case of the single helix having the pressure plate at one end and the external or internal cap at the other, since the user has to apply a big force to the pressure plate and the cap so as to suppress an elastic force of the filament, it is also difficult to operate the trigger.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">Hereinafter, a heat pack according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="19">A heat pack according to a first embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, comprises a container 2 which is made of a flexible material such as polyethylene, PVC, and so forth, a sodium acetate solution which is supercooled below a solidification point in the container 2 so as not to leak from the container 2, a single coil spring 10 for generating a crystallization reaction of the sodium acetate solution, which is used as a trigger.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The coil spring 10 has windings in close contact with each other so that the spacing between the windings is zero.
      <br/>
      On the outer face of the coil spring 10, there is provided a tube 20 made of rubber.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Hereinafter, an operation of the heat pack according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="22">
      When the coil spring 10 is bent by an user to use the heat pack 1, it causes the windings of the coil spring 10 to make a friction therebetween, resulting in a generation of spark.
      <br/>
      The spark makes the solution react.
      <br/>
      The solution is crystalized while the reaction of the solution is widely spread around the coil spring 10.
    </p>
    <p num="23">As the solution 3 starts to generate the heat, the coil spring 10 may be returned by a resilient force to the initial state.</p>
    <p num="24">In a second embodiment of the trigger according to the present invention, as shown in FIG. 5, a coil spring 30 used as the trigger has windings which are partially contacted with each other.</p>
    <p num="25">
      That is, the coil spring 30 is deformed so that the windings are laid down to one side.
      <br/>
      Therefore, Since the windings are partially contacted with each other, it is not necessary to limit a pitch between the windings.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The coil spring 30 has a longitudinal axis and a series of interconnected coil windings.
      <br/>
      Each of the windings is generally circular and is laid down in a plane disposed at an acute angle to the longitudinal axis of the spring.
      <br/>
      The width of the coil spring along the length of the longitudinal axis is equal to the diameters of the circular windings, and the thickness of the coil spring along the length of the longitudinal axis is less than the diameters of the circular winding.
    </p>
    <p num="27">The coil spring 30 is covered with a tube 20 made of rubber.</p>
    <p num="28">The operation of crystallization of the solution is the same as the first embodiment of the trigger according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="29">
      That is, as shown in FIGS. 6a and 6b, When the coil spring 10 is bent by an user to use the heat pack 1, it causes the windings of the coil spring 10 to make a friction therebetween, resulting in a generation of spark.
      <br/>
      The spark makes the solution react.
      <br/>
      The solution is crystalized while the reaction of the solution is widely spread around the coil spring 10.
    </p>
    <p num="30">As described as above, since the thickness of the coil spring 30 according the the second embodiment of the present invention is smaller than that of the coil spring 10 of the second embodiment (d&gt;d'), the occupation space of the spring 30 can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="31">In addition, since the coil spring 30 is in a state that its windings are laid down to one side, at least two coil spring 30 can be manufactured with one coil spring 10, whereby the manufacturing cost can be lowered.</p>
    <p num="32">Further, since the coil spring 30 is not compressed, the bending operation of the coil spring 30 is facilitated giving the user convenience.</p>
    <p num="33">According to the present invention, as described above, the coil spring 10, 30 cannot be broken in spite of being bent many times, resulting in extending the life time of the heat pack 1.</p>
    <p num="34">In the trigger according to the present invention, it is not necessary to provide a separate manufacturing process.</p>
    <p num="35">While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to particular embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be effected therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
