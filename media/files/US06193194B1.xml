      A traveling-field, magnetic propulsion system and operating method is provided for achieving economical space travel.
      <br/>
      The system is based upon designing the vehicle in the form of a single-stage streamlined circular toroidal airfoil containing a thin-walled superconducting solenoid.
      <br/>
      It is initially launched vertically off the earth's surface into a vacuum environment at 125 km using conventional rocket propulsion.
      <br/>
      It is then accelerated along a high-inclination trajectory by a traveling repulsive magnetic field generated by ejecting an easily ionizable low-density gas cloud in the vehicle's magnetic field and transmitting a high-power, plane-polarized, microwave beam at the cloud tuned to the electron cyclotron resonant frequency.
      <br/>
      The transmitter is constructed horizontally on the earth's surface as an electronically-steered, phased array several hundred meters in diameter energized by a large superconducting energy storage system.
      <br/>
      The transmitter will be able to transmit a converging CW microwave beam at the vehicle with very high power to magnetically accelerate it over great distances without atmospheric breakdown.
      <br/>
      The method can be used as a general high-speed earth or space transportation system by catapulting suborbital or orbital payloads, or by catapulting multikiloton payloads to other celestial bodies with mass ratios below that of long-range aircraft.

    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="1">
      At the present time the most economic, technically viable method used for launching and accelerating high-mass space vehicles from the earth's surface to orbital or escape velocities is based upon rocket or jet propulsion wherein propulsive thrust is achieved by burning a gas inside pressure chambers and creating pressure differentials on the walls by expelling the gas through a system of nozzles.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, since the required velocities are relatively high, most of the chemical energy is wasted accelerating large amounts of unburned fuel, and the inert structural mass required to contain it.
      <br/>
      Thus, the useful payload is a small fraction of the vehicle's initial launch mass.
      <br/>
      This has serious technical implications in terms of payload limitations which appear to be unavoidable.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The minimum mass ratio (launch mass/burn-out mass) for achieving low earth orbit using LH2 /LO2 propellant is about 10 0 (slashed zero)  Unfortunately, since the density of LH2 is very low, the vehicle must be designed with a large structural mass to contain it.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the required initial mass will be very high, even for relatively small payloads.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cost to put payloads into orbit is very-high even if the vehicle is reusable.
      <br/>
      For example, the expected minimum cost of transporting payloads into orbit by the proposed reusable single-stage Aerospace Plane propelled by idealized scramjets operating at maximum efficiency or by the vertically launched Delta Clipper will be about $300/kg ($136/lb), and the size and weight of the payloads will be relatively small.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The problem of achieving economical space travel does not involve energy.
      <br/>
      A long-range 747 airliner burns the equivalent of twice its own orbital energy in the fuel it consumes.
      <br/>
      The problem is the high mass ratio of the launch vehicle set by the rocket equation.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the underlying propulsion principles (i.e., the technical methods) of space travel remain unchanged, space travel will always remain very expensive and way beyond the reach of ordinary citizens.
      <br/>
      The situation can not be significantly improved by utilizing remotely generated laser or microwave beams to heat the propellant gas because of thermal and structural limitations.
      <br/>
      Although nuclear propelled vehicles could achieve high velocities in interplanetary space, they could not be operated directly from the earth's surface.
      <br/>
      The basic mass ratio problem of launching payloads from the earth's surface into orbit would still remain.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The technical problem of achieving economical space travel is one of the most challenging problems in applied physics.
      <br/>
      In actually, the problem is not actively pursued because it is viewed as having no viable solution that is attainable with current technology.
      <br/>
      The propulsion method and operating system introduced herein will provide a solution to this problem.
      <br/>
      What is most significant is that this method is well within technological feasibility, and, from an engineering point of view, will be relatively easy to develop and implement.
      <br/>
      It could also be utilized as a propulsion method for achieving low-cost high-speed intercontinental transportation at speeds far beyond that of supersonic airliners.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      In the vehicle acceleration method presented herein, the entire vehicle is designed with a streamlined toroidal geometry having a diameter ranging from a few meters to several hundred meters containing a thin-walled superconducting solenoid coil mounted inside with approximately the same diameter.
      <br/>
      Thus, the vehicle resembles a circular flying wing with a constant length-to-thickness ratio airfoil.
      <br/>
      The solenoid is charged with current to create a large axial magnetic field in the circular region inside the vehicle's perimeter.
      <br/>
      The vehicle's superstructure is designed as a stress-bearing containment vessel to support the magnetic stress acting on the charged solenoid which tends to pull it apart and compress it into its mid-plane.
      <br/>
      The acceleration method involves launching the vehicle with conventional chemical rocket propulsion on a nearly vertical ballistic trajectory which is designed only to reach a vacuum environment at an altitude of about 125 km using relatively little propellant.
      <br/>
      The energy required to propel the vehicle into the vacuum environment is only about 1/10 of that required to propel it all the way into orbit.
      <br/>
      After the vehicle reaches the vacuum environment, it is accelerated to orbital or escape velocities by a traveling repulsive magnetic field.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The traveling repulsive magnetic field is generated by ejecting a low-density, easily ionizable gas cloud behind the vehicle in the magnetic field of the solenoid and transmitting a plane-polarized microwave beam into the cloud from a very large transmitter mounted horizontally on the earth's surface.
      <br/>
      By selecting a frequency tuned to the electron cyclotron resonant frequency of the vehicle's magnetic field, the incident microwave beam ionizes the gas and accelerates the free electrons into high-energy cyclotron resonant orbits.
      <br/>
      In view of Lenz's Law, the orbiting electrons become strong magnetic dipoles that oppose the magnetic field of the solenoid.
      <br/>
      They are accelerated away from the vehicle by magnetic repulsive forces, taking the positively charged ions with them by electrostatic forces.
      <br/>
      In their aggregate, the orbiting electron dipoles generate a large repulsive magnetic field that travels behind the vehicle that is sustained by the ejected gas cloud and by the microwave beam that is continuously transmitted and focused inside the vehicle's perimeter.
      <br/>
      The thrust vector lies along the vehicle's central axis.
      <br/>
      By rotating a pressurized toroidal passenger cabin inside the vehicle, an artificial gravity environment is created which also gives the vehicle gyroscopic spin stability to cancel non-axial magnetic torque from the earth's magnetic field.
      <br/>
      Since this acceleration method can be used in reverse to decelerate a vehicle approaching the transmitter from space, the vehicles are reusable and can, with the aid of atmospheric breaking, be decelerated to land at the launch site by reversing the steps.
      <br/>
      By constructing the transmitter horizontally on the earth's surface adjacent the launch site in the form of a multiple-feed, electronically-steered phased array several hundred meters in diameter with a high power density energized by a large system of underground toroidal superconducting energy storage coils, it will be possible to achieve virtually unlimited CW beam power.
      <br/>
      This power is converted directly into the traveling repulsive magnetic field which accelerates the vehicle over great distances.
      <br/>
      Atmospheric breakdown is avoided by generating the beam over a large area on the earth's surface and focusing it on the vehicle above the atmosphere.
      <br/>
      The resulting accelerating force can be many times greater than any previous technically viable vehicle acceleration method.
      <br/>
      The invention will enable single-stage reusable space vehicles to accelerate enormous payloads to escape velocities with mass ratios that are actually lower than that of long-range airliners.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The propulsion system disclosed herein is radically different from any prior propulsion system for space travel in that the underlying method is specifically designed to achieve optimum performance and efficiency.
      <br/>
      This is achieved by basing the operating principles on "optimum performance principles" and some basic principles of geometry.
      <br/>
      Consequently, to understand the operating principles of the system, it is important to understand the optimum operating principles behind it.
      <br/>
      Since it will always be possible to generate more power off a vehicle than on a vehicle, the basic principle of accelerating a space vehicle by beamed power will enable the vehicle to out perform conventional propulsion systems that use an onboard power generating system that adds to the vehicle's inertial mass.
      <br/>
      But there is a simple geometrical fact that will give the beamed power vehicle acceleration method described here, maximum performance.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A circle has the unique property of enclosing a maximum area for a given perimeter.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the optimal shape of a vehicle propelled by a given amount of beamed power will be circular (in the form of a thin torus), and the power is equal to the power density multiplied by the vehicle's enclosed area.
      <br/>
      Since this power does not make physical contact with any part of the vehicle's structure, the power density, and hence the total power, has no upper limit.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the power can be converted directly into propulsive thrust with very high conversion efficiency, the system will be capable of generating the highest possible thrust-to-mass ratio.
      <br/>
      These theoretical optimum performance principles represent the basic design principles of the present system.
      <br/>
      It can be achieved by mounting a superconducting solenoid inside the circular vehicle, expelling a tenuous gas cloud behind the vehicle in the magnetic field of the solenoid, and beaming the power by a plane-polarized microwave beam tuned to the solenoid's electron cyclotron resonant frequency.
      <br/>
      This will create a thrust-generating traveling repulsive magnetic field behind the vehicle while moving in space that is sustained by ejecting the gas cloud and by the microwave beam.
      <br/>
      This is the invention that is disclosed herein.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      By designing the microwave transmitter in the form of an electronically-steered, multiple-feed phased array mounted horizontally on the earth's surface in a suitable location, it will be possible to construct the array with essentially unlimited size fed by an unlimited number of microwave generators operating in parallel.
      <br/>
      Since the vehicle's thrust-to-weight ratio is designed to be greater than 1.0, the acceleration trajectory can be nearly vertical so that only one transmitter is required.
      <br/>
      The power used to energize the array is provided by a system of toroidal superconducting energy storage coils having diameters of several kilometers embedded underground.
      <br/>
      Since the stored inductive energy in the coils can be extracted at essentially any power desired for the microwave generators, it will be possible for the array to generate and transmit virtually unlimited power over great distances to give the vehicle an optimum acceleration profile.
      <br/>
      Atmospheric breakdown is avoided by transmitting the beam over a large area within the atmosphere with relatively low power density, and focusing it on the vehicle above the atmosphere with very high power density.
      <br/>
      By accelerating the vehicle with relatively low acceleration (e.g., 2 g) over a distance of 3 * 105 km, velocities exceeding 100 km/sec can be achieved.
      <br/>
      With these velocities, it will not be necessary to accelerate the vehicle beyond the range of the transmitter to achieve ultra high-speed interplanetary space travel.
      <br/>
      A similar transmitter constructed near the landing site on another celestial body will provide the deceleration.
      <br/>
      Thus, with this propulsion concept, it is not necessary to generate any propulsive energy onboard the vehicle beyond that required for guidance.
      <br/>
      It will be shown that the amount of ejected gas required to reach 100 km/sec is a small fraction of the vehicle's structural mass.
      <br/>
      Therefore, since the amount of launch propellant is also less than the vehicle's structural mass, the vehicle's overall mass ratio will be remarkably small.
      <br/>
      In fact, it will be shown that the mass ratios will actually be lower than that of long-range commercial airliners.
      <br/>
      Although the electrical energy required to charge the superconducting storage coils can be obtained from large photovoltaic arrays, the preferred system will utilize high-temperature, radiatively-cooled, MHD nuclear-electric generators.
      <br/>
      The problem of radioactive waste disposal can be solved by simply ejecting the waste products out of the Solar System using unmanned cargo vehicles.
      <br/>
      Since the vehicles are reusable, the cost for space travel will essentially equal the cost for generating the electrical energy.
      <br/>
      By designing the nuclear power plants to be very reliable and automated, this cost can be reduced to a small fraction of the cost of hydroelectric power.

      FIG. 1 illustrates the vehicle's circular design.
      <br/>
      A superconducting solenoid 10, mounted inside the vehicle 12, generates a static axial magnetic field 14.
      <br/>
      The vehicle 12 is launched from the earth's surface by a rocket propulsion system 16 to reach a vacuum environment at an altitude of about 125 km.
      <br/>
      After the vehicle reaches this altitude, a very tenuous gas cloud is ejected behind the vehicle 12 and the microwave beam is turned on.
      <br/>
      As is shown in FIG. 2, the beam 18 ionizes the gas cloud 20 and accelerates the free electrons into high-energy cyclotron resonant orbits 22.
      <br/>
      The resulting magnetic field 24 acts repulsively on the magnetic field 14 generated by the solenoid 10 and accelerates the vehicle by magnetic repulsive forces.

      To demonstrate the basic engineering feasibility of this microwave-generated traveling repulsive magnetic field vehicle acceleration method it is necessary to show that the vehicle's thrust-to-weight ratio can in fact exceed 1 0 (slashed zero)  This can be demonstrated by determining the minimum required vehicle mass Ms corresponding to various radii R and microwave frequencies f, showing that these parameters have realizable values, and showing that the corresponding thrust-to-weight ratios are greater than 1.0 for realizable microwave transmitters.
      <br/>
      The required operating parameters of the vehicle's superconducting propulsion solenoid, such as maximum magnetic field strength Bm and current density J, should also be realizable.
      <br/>
      In order to accomplish this analysis, it is necessary to present the basic physics behind the system and its mathematical representation.

      A charged superconducting solenoid generates an axial magnetic field which can be fairly intense.
      <br/>
      This magnetic field generates Lorentz forces on the solenoid's conductor which exert various mechanical stresses that must be contained by some supporting mass.
      <br/>
      Ideally, this supporting mass will be provided by the vehicle's entire structure.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the vehiclc's minimum possible mass is equal to the minimum structural mass required to support the magnetic stress generated by the solenoid mounted inside.
      <br/>
      This mass depends upon the solenoid's length l, radius R, and total current.
      <br/>
      Omitting the details, it can be shown that the minimum structural mass Ms required to contain the tension that tends to pull a thin-walled solenoid apart (magnetic hoop-stress) and, simultaneously, the magnetic compressive forces that tend to compress the solenoid into its mid-plane, is given by  (Equation image '1' not included in text)

      For small values of  BETA  between 0 and 0.1, the value of Q( BETA ) is given approximately by the linear interpolation function

      The superconducting cable used in the vehicle solenoid can be designed to be stress-bearing with a very high tensile strength  SIGMA c, and a low density  RHO c. This enables the solenoid to be partially self-supporting.

      Assuming that the vehicle structure has the same  SIGMA  and  RHO , and is designed to support the coil, the quantity Ms given in equation (6) is equal to the minimum possible vehicle mass, which includes the coil mass.

      Based on recent advances in materials research (see Ko, T. H. and Huang, L. C., "Preparation of High-Performance Carbon Fibres From PAN Fibres Modified With Cobaltous Chloride," Journal of Materials Science, Vol. 27, 1992, pp. 2429-2436), the values of  SIGMA  and  RHO  can be taken to be:

      SIGMA =4.5 * 109 N/m2 and  RHO =1,520 kg/m3  (7)

    <p num="22">
      The ratio of superconducting material to fiber material is relatively small.

      Consequently, the resulting cable can be assumed to have an effective tensile strength  SIGMA =4.5 * 109 N/m2 and a density  RHO =1,520 kg/m3.
      <br/>
      Since experiments indicate that the cable is intrinsically stable, stabilizer material such as copper or aluminum may be unnecessary. (See the above article by Ko.) However, to provide a high degree of safety, the cable is assumed to have an aluminum stabilizer. (See Huang, X. et al, "High Current Density Aluminum Stabilized Conductor Concepts For Space Applications," IEEE Transactions On Magnetics, Vol. 25, No. 2, March 1989, pp. 1532-1535.) For simplicity, it will be assumed that the coil and vehicle have an average  SIGMA  and  RHO  equal to the numerical values given above. (This assumption is valid because the coil mass will be a small fraction of the total minimum vehicle mass Ms.)

      If a microwave beam of sufficient intensity is passed through a gas, the gas becomes ionized and the microwave beam is absorbed by ionization and thermalization processes.
      <br/>
      However, if the gas has very low density, and if a constant magnetic field with a certain intensity is applied, the amount of microwave energy required to ionize the gas can be significantly reduced. (See, MacDonald, A. D., Microwave Breakdown In Gases, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, London, Sydney, 1966, p. 135.) If, after ionization, a free electron moves in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field B with velocity .nu., the resulting Lorentz force e(.nu. * B) will force the electron to move in a circular path with radius r given by  (Equation image '6' not included in text)

      If the microwave radiation is plane-polarized and has a frequency f equal to the electron's gyration frequency 1/p, the energy transfer mechanism called electron cyclotron resonance is achieved.
      <br/>
      When this occurs, the orbiting electrons are accelerated on successive revolutions by the oscillating electric field vector of the microwave radiation.
      <br/>
      Since this is the underlying principle of the classical cyclotron, the phenomenon is known as electron cyclotron resonance.

      If the electron-ion collision frequency is significantly below the cyclotron resonant frequency f of the microwave radiation, the orbiting electrons continue to absorb microwave radiation by cyclotron resonance in a nearly collisionless acceleration process.
      <br/>
      The electrons are thus pumped into very high-energy cyclotron orbits perpendicular to the magnetic field lines.
      <br/>
      A strong coupling between the plasma and the microwave radiation is created, resulting in the absorption of essentially all the microwave radiation.
      <br/>
      This can be achieved if the gas has a very low-density and there is no interfering background gas.

      Since the vehicle is essentially a very large superconducting magnetic solenoid, these principles can be utilized most effectively to generate a traveling repulsive magnetic field behind the vehicle after it is launched and enters a vacuum environment at high altitude.
      <br/>
      This is achieved by ejecting an easily ionizable gas cloud into the magnetic field and transmitting a high-power plane-polarized microwave beam from the earth's surface with a frequency tuned to an electron cyclotron resonant frequency of the vehicle's magnetic field.
      <br/>
      If the microwave beam remains focused on the circular region inside the vehicle's inner perimeter (i.e., inside the solenoid), the intensity of the traveling repulsive magnetic field and, hence, the resulting accelerating thrust will not decrease with increasing distance from the transmitter.
      <br/>
      By generating the microwave beam with a multiple-feed, electronically-steered phased array constructed horizontally on the earth's surface with a diameter of several hundred meters fed by electric current from a sufficiently large inductive superconducting energy storage system it will be possible to achieve levels of accelerating thrust many times greater than any presently known, technically viable propulsion concept.
      <br/>
      Moreover, this acceleration process is basically magnetic, and hence very efficient.

      <br/>
      At this point, the microwave transmitter is turned on (with gradually increasing power), and the beam 18 is focused inside the vehicle's perimeter which ionizes the gas cloud 20. (See FIGS. 1 and 2.) The frequency of the microwave beam 18 is designed to produce electron cyclotron resonance in the region of the vehicle's magnetic field 14 where the magnetic repulsive force generated by the gyrating cyclotron electrons 22 will be maximum.
      <br/>
      It will be shown that this optimal electron cyclotron resonance region is located behind the vehicle, a distance equal to one-half the vehicle radius from the mid-plane.

      In view of the resonant magnetic field, the amount of microwave power required to ionize the gas represents a small fraction of the total beam power.

      As described in MacDonald's book cited above, the magnetic field reduces the required ionization energy to about 1/20 the energy normally required.
      <br/>
      The free electrons absorb the microwave energy by being accelerated into high-energy cyclotron orbits.
      <br/>
      A strong coupling between the plasma and the microwave beam is created, resulting in the absorption of essentially all the beam power by the plasma.
      <br/>
      But unlike most beamed-power vehicle propulsion concepts, this absorption is not thermalization.
      <br/>
      Most of the power is pumped into extremely high-energy electron cyclotron orbits.
      <br/>
      The orbiting electrons become strong magnetic dipoles that oppose the vehicle's magnetic field.
      <br/>
      They are accelerated away from the vehicle by magnetic repulsive forces, taking the positively charged ions with them by electrostatic forces.
      <br/>
      In their aggregate, the orbiting electron dipoles generate a very large traveling repulsive magnetic field behind the vehicle that is sustained by the ejected gas cloud and by the microwave beam that is continuously transmitted and focused at the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Since the beam quality is very high and since there is no interfering background gas, the acceleration process is very efficient.
      <br/>
      Essentially all of the beam power received at the vehicle is converted directly into magnetic repulsive thrust with a conversion efficiency approaching 95%.
      <br/>
      The process enables vast amounts of inexpensive microwave power to be converted directly into propulsive thrust.
      <br/>
      Since the vehicle is accelerated along a high inclination trajectory 26 (see FIG. 3) that is maintained nearly broadside to the transmitting antenna 30 by a gyro attitude control system, it can be accelerated over great distances to achieve very high escape velocities.
      <br/>
      The method could also be used to place an enormous payload into geo-synchronous orbit, or to catapult an enormous payload onto a low-energy escape trajectory that could be subsequently propelled by gravity propulsion to return the vehicle to Earth. (See Dowling, R. L., et al., "Gravity Propulsion Research at UCLA and JPL, 1962-1964," International Academy of Astronautics, IAA Paper 91-677, Oct. 1991) When such a vehicle approaches a target body, the payload is released, soft-landed on the surface, and the vehicle returns to earth on a non-stop, free-fall, round-trip trajectory.
      <br/>
      It will be shown that a convoy of such vehicles could deliver enormous payloads to other celestial bodies at a cost not significantly higher than large ocean freighters.

      An important operating feature of this vehicle acceleration concept is the fact that the microwave beam does not have to propagate along the central axis of the vehicle in order to pump the electrons.
      <br/>
      Since the microwave beam is plane-polarized, the oscillating electric field vector of the microwave beam that pumps the electrons into their resonant cyclotron orbits will always be perpendicular to the central axis if the microwave beam is in the vehicle's trajectory plane (which is assumed to be perpendicular Lo the earth's surface).
      <br/>
      This condition can always be satisfied by constructing the transmitter near the launch site.

      Previous studies of plasma accelecration by elcetron cyclotron resonanec using microwave power at a frequency of 8.35 GHz with argon indicate that a gas stream density of 2 * 1019 molecules/M3 will produce a nearly collisionless acceleration process with essentially zero thermalization, i.e.  ETA c will be nearly 1 0 (slashed zero)  (See, Kosmahl, H. G. et al, "Plasma Acceleration With Microwaves Near Cyclotron Resonance," Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 38, No. 12, Nov. 1967, pp. 4576-4582.) The number density of the atmosphere at an altitude of 125 km is 2.5 * 107 molecules/m3.
      <br/>
      Therefore, to eliminate the presence of background atmospheric gas from interfering with the electrodynamics of electron cyclotron acceleration, the microwave acceleration will begin after the vehicle has reached an altitude of 125 km.
      <br/>
      At this altitude, the ambient pressure is 1.2 * 10-5 Torr.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the collision frequency with background atmospheric gas will be negligible when the microwave acceleration begins.
      <br/>
      Since most of the microwave acceleration occurs above 150 km, it can be assumed that the microwave acceleration occurs in a perfect vacuum environment with no background gas.

      One of the most important considerations effecting the transmission of microwave power through the atmosphere concerns atmospheric breakdown.

The breakdown occurs when the pressure is between 10 and 0.1 Torr. This pressure range corresponds to altitudes between 40 km and 60 km.

      The breakdown power density increases fairly rapidly at altitudes outside this range.
      <br/>
      For microwave frequencies between 5 and 30 GHz, the breakdown altitude is approximately 47 km where the pressure is 1.0 Torr. By constructing the microwave transmitter horizontally on the earth's surface in the form of an electronically-steered, phased array covering a large area several hundred meters in diameter, it will be possible to transmit hundreds of terawatts of CW microwave power over great distances without atmospheric breakdown.

      Since the vehicle has a circular toroidal geometry resembling a circular flying wing with constant cord and is launched and landed vertically with its mid-plane parallel to the earth's surface, these minimum mass requirements arc well within engineering feasibility.

      A very important design feature is the fact that the rocket propelled launch system only has to catapult the vehicle ballistically to a peak altitude of 125 km where the velocity will be close to zero.

      Since the energy of this ascent trajectory is a small fraction of orbital energy, the required mass ratio is only about 1.60. This fact has very important vehicle design implications because the propellant tanks needed to carry the rocket propellant will be relatively small.

    <p num="73">
      Another important operating feature is the vehicle's relatively low ascent velocity through the atmosphere.
      <br/>
      It will be shown that the maximum velocity will be 1,350 m/sec (Mach 4.4) which will occur at burn-out at an altitude of about 32,000 m. Thus, there will be relatively little aerodynamic heating.
      <br/>
      The magnetic propulsion will decelerate a returning vehicle outside the atmosphere such that the reentry velocity will be close to zero at 125 km.

      This enables a circular flexible Kevlar sheet to be deployed over the vehicle's upper end prior to reentry to serve as a large ballute for aerodynamic braking.
      <br/>
      In view of the vehicle's circular geometry, this aerodynamic braking will be extremely effective.

      Having developed the above mathematical description of the traveling magnetic field propulsion system, it is now possible to establish engineering feasibility (i.e., to show that the propulsion system will give the vehicle a thrust-to-weight greater than 1.0) and to conduct quantitative performance analysis.
      <br/>
      This analysis is based upon experimental data obtained from small microwave generated plasma accelerators using the principle of electron cyclotron resonance, and scaling up the dimensions which are independent of these parameters.
      <br/>
      This experimental data indicates that by injecting argon gas with a low number density n=2 * 1019 molecules/m3 into a resonant magnetic field operating at a microwave frequency of 8.35 GHz, it will be possible to achieve nearly ideal collisionless electron cyclotron resonance pumping by the microwave beam. (Sec the above mentioned article by Kosnmahl.) Essentially all of the incoming microwave power will be converted into kinetic energy of the gyrating electrons which are accelerated by magnetic repulsive forces away from the solenoid in a directed plasma stream.
      <br/>
      If this number density is used with a higher microwave frequency, the process becomes even more efficient.
      <br/>
      Since the atmosphere has a natural microwave transmission window at 30 GHz, this frequency is selected as the preferred operating frequency of the propulsion system.

Consequently, by designing the gas injection system to inject the gas into the solenoid's magnetic field with a uniform particle density of 2 * 109 molecules/m3 in a hard vacuum environment with no interfering background gas, it will be possible to obtain a microwave coupling efficiency with ionized gas close to the ideal theoretical limit (i.e.,  ETA c (congruent to) 1.0).

      The argon gas injection system is also designed to inject the gas into the magnetic field with an axial velocity u0 =1,500 m/sec.

      The energy required can be obtained by utilizing some of the incoming microwave power that is not completely absorbed by the gas.
      <br/>
      A plurality of microwave horns, mounted 360 (degree)  around the base of the vehicle, could be used to capture some of this power.
      <br/>
      A small fraction could be converted into electrical power to compress liquefied argon to high pressure (e.g., 500 Bar).
      <br/>
      The remaining portion could be used to vaporize and heat it to 2,000 (degree)  K. The heated compressed gas could then be ejected through a system of miniature nozzles positioned around the inside periphery of the vehicle to generate the gas cloud uniformly with the desired axial velocity.

      Since it is not be possible to design a vehicle such that all of its structural mass can be utilized to support the coil stress, the actual minimum mass M0, will exceed the theoretical minimum mass Ms by at least 50%.
      <br/>
      To be conservative, it will be assumed that the actual minimum vehicle mass exceeds Ms by 100%.

      It follows from equation (24) that the minimum propulsive power Pr received from a microwave transmitter operating at the maximum power density always occurs when the vehicle is closest to the transmitter at the minimum altitude of 125 km.

      If this minimum beam power is not sufficiently high, the vehicle's initial thrust-to-weight ratio at the beginning of the magnetic propulsion will be less than 1.0, and the vehicle will fall back to earth.
      <br/>
      Since the operating frequency is 30 GHz, the minimum vehicle mass M0 =2M, obtained from equation (28), is completely determined by it's radius R.nu.. (See Table 1.).

      The microwave transmitter is designed to operate with a variable power density where the maximum is 3.60 * 107 W/2 (3.6 KW/cm2).

      In view of ionization losses, the microwave coupling efficiency will be about 0.95. Consequently, the vehicle's minimum thrust-to-weight ratio F/M0 g (where g=9.43 m/sec2) is completely determined by it's radius R.nu., and the radius Rt of the microwave transmitter.

      This table demonstrates that for any given transmitter radii Rt, the maximum transmitted power Pmax increases very slowly with increasing vehicle radii R.nu., Thus, the maximum power of the system is determined primarily by the diameter of the transmitter.

      For example, the maximum initial power Pmax that can be transmitted to a 50 m diameter vehicle using a 2,000 m diameter transmitter operating at 30 GHz is 45.37 TW. This power increases to only 46.73 TW if the vehicle diameter is doubled.

      But the payload of the larger vehicle will be almost twice that of the smaller. (It will be shown later that the payloads that these reusable vehicles could transfer to the Moon using the same 2,000 m diameter transmitter is 1,564 MT and 2,364 MT respectively.

      One of the most important underlying design features of this vehicle acceleration concept is the fact by utilizing the principles of electronically-steered phased array microwave transmitters and superconducting energy storage systems, it will be relatively easy to construct a single-aperture transmitter capable of transmitting a coherent plane-polarized CW microwave beam of hundreds of terrawatts.
      <br/>
      It is only a matter of dimensions.
      <br/>
      Since there are many remote regions where large transmitters and underground superconducting energy storage systems can be constructed, virtually unlimited beam power can be achieved.
      <br/>
      By taking advantage of the economics of mass production, it will be very cost effective to construct transmitters with large dimensions.
      <br/>
      This is particularly true for superconducting energy storage systems since the cost of these systems is proportional to E1/3 where E is equal to the stored energy capacity. (See, S. M. Schoenung and W. R. Meier, "A Comparison of Large-Scale Toroidal and Solenoidal SMES Systems," IEEE Transactions On Magnetics, Vol. 27, No. 2, March 1991, pp. 2324-2328, and R. J. Loyd et al, "An Overview Of The SMES ETV Program: The Bechtel T eam's Perspective," IEEE Transactions On Magnetics, Vol. 25, No. 2, March 1989, pp. 1569-1575.).

      By constructing the superconducting energy storage system with coils having radii on the order of 50 km or more, embedded deep underground on multiple levels, it will be possible to achieve a stored energy capacity exceeding 10.about. J. The electrical energy needed to charge the superconducting energy storage coils could be obtained by compact automated radiatively-cooled MHD nuclear-electric generators. (See, Rosa, R. J., and Myrabo, L. N., "Ultra-Performance Closed-Cycle Gas Core Reactors For Orbit Raising," Orbit-Raising and Maneuvering Propulsion, Vol. 87, Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics, 1984, pp. 460-476.) Since these generators could operate continuously over very long time periods using very little fuel, the cost of the electrical energy could be very low. (This cost could be reduced to almost zero by employing breeder reactions.) These MHD nuclear-electric generators would be ideal for remote desert areas.
      <br/>
      Excess electrical energy not needed for propulsion could be fed into a commercial power grid and sold to utility companies to generate additional income revenue.
      <br/>
      It is conceivable that such revenue could far exceed the cost of operating the space vehicles.
      <br/>
      This would open the possibility of providing commercial interplanetary space travel at essentially zero cost.

      The electrical energy could also be generated photoelectrically by very large solar arrays covering several hundred square kilometers.
      <br/>
      However, it is conceivable that the most economical method for generating the electrical energy is by converting ambient heat energy (natural thermal energy) into mechanical work using my previous invention of closed-cycle cryogenic engines.
      <br/>
      These engines are designed by using a paramagnetic working fluid such as oxygen and extracting entropy magnetically by the principle of adiabatic demagnetization. (See my U.S. Pat. No. 5,040,373.)

      Larger vehicles, such as those described in FIG. 10, would be used for interplanetary flights.

      This angular momentum will prevent the vehicle from flipping over due to magnetic torque acting on the vehicle's solenoid by non-axial external magnetic fields.

      As soon as the free-moving coil is released and begins to rise via magnetic repulsive forces, the magnetic torque will immediately flip the coil over, whereupon the repulsive force becomes attractive, forcing the coil back toward the fixed coil.

      As far as the Applacant knows, this is a new discovery made by the Applicant in 1993 which can be utilized for launching and landing circular vehicles equipped with superconducting solenoids on the surfaces of celestial bodies without rocket propulsion by means of conservative force fields.

      <br/>
      By embedding a system of coaxial superconducting coils underground with very large radii, and charging them with current, it is possible to create an artificial static magnetic field with an intensity mnany times greater than the earth's natural magnetic field, extending upward several hundred kilometers.
      <br/>
      If a coil-carrying circular vehicle is placed coaxially at the center of this system, constrained, and charged with sufficient current, it is possible to generate an upward magnetic repulsive force greater than the downward force of gravity.
      <br/>
      Consequently, when the vehicle is released, it will accelerate upward by means of a "force field" without using any rocket propulsion.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, it will be impossible to maintain the vehicle's attitude such that its vertical axis will be precisely aligned along the direction of the external magnetic field vector B passing through its center.

      However, by giving the vehicle angular momentum, which can be generated by rotating a circular ring-like mass inside the vehicle (e.g.,toroidal payload bays or passenger cabins) or by rotating the entire vehicle by means of a rotating launching platform, the angular momentum will prevent the magnetic torque from flipping the vehicle over.

      This will enable the vehicle (with very large dimensions) to be catapulted through the open atmosphere at relatively low acceleration to very high altitudes by a static magnetic field acting over great distances.

      If the stationary coils are sufficiently large this (static field) magnetic propulsion concept could be utilized in principle to achieve space travel without consuming any energy.

      The acceleration process is achieved by converting magnetic potential energy at the launch site into gravitational potential and kinetic energy, and the deceleration process is achieved by converting gravitational potential and kinetic energy back into magnetic potential energy at the landing site.
      <br/>
      Omitting the relatively minor effects of atmospheric drag, the conversion processes are conservative and no energy is lost.
      <br/>
      Thus, by giving the vehicle angular momentum prior to launch, it can be lifted off the surface and accelerated to escape velocities to another planet, decelerated, and landed by another repulsive magnetic field using the same process in reverse.

      There is an important theorem in theoretical mechanics stating that the angular momentum about the center of mass of a rotating body is an invariant for all reference frames in relative translational motion. (See, J. L. Synge and B. A. Griffith, Principles of Mechanics, McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc. New York, 1949, p. 330.)

      <br/>
      Therefore, upon substituting equation (34) into (35) and making use of the fact that B=Bk, the general equation for the vehicle's angular momentum along the ascent trajectory can be expressed as  (Equation image '32' not included in text)

    <p num="146">I shall now describe the detailed design and construction of the microwave power transmission system.</p>
    <p num="147">
      Although the construction of a CW beamed power steerable transmitter capable of generating several hundred terawatts at optical frequencies is well beyond technical feasibility, it can be achieved at microwave frequencies by constructing the transmitter horizontally on the earth's surface to obtain large dimensions and utilizing the principles of multiple-feed, electronically-steered phased arrays. (See, B. I. Hill, "High Power Tubes For Phased Array Applications," Ch. 3.2 in, Microwave Power Engineering, Vol. 2, E. C. Okress (ed.), Academic Press, New York, 1968, pp. 249-255, and N. A. Amitay et al, Theory and Analysis of Phased Array Antennas, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1972.) This will enable virtually unlimited amounts of microwave power to be transmitted if sufficient electrical input power is available.
      <br/>
      The superconducting energy storage system will provide this input power.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      Basically, the transmitter is constructed by joining individual radiating elements (e.g., beam launching horns) fed by microwave generators, phase shifters and waveguides all operating in parallel, to project a coherent plane-polarized microwave beam.
      <br/>
      The beam is steered electronically by the phase shifters which control the phase of each radiating element.
      <br/>
      It is possible to design the microwave feed system with low loss waveguides so that more than 98% of the microwave power fed into the system is transmitted.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      The transmitting horns could have square transverse cross-sections with aperture dimensions 4 LAMBDA  by 4 LAMBDA .
      <br/>
      Hence, at 30 GHz,  LAMBDA =0.01 m and the aperture dimensions of each element would be 4 cm * 4 cm.
      <br/>
      The array could be mounted with  LAMBDA /2 spacing to achieve a closely-packed array with negligible side lobes.
      <br/>
      This close-packing array design will enable more than 95% of the radiated power to be contained in the main lobe which forms the microwave beam.
      <br/>
      By mounting many of these elements in the form of 5 m by 5 m subarrays at the manufacturing plant, constructing an array having essentially any diameter desired could proceed by simply joining the subarrays on a horizontal mounting frame and connecting the power cables, control cables, and water cooling conduits.
      <br/>
      The cooling system could be provided by a grid of large-diameter underground water conduits constructed under the array fed by a large reservoir.
      <br/>
      A maximum power density of 3 KW/cm2 would be more than sufficient to generate a coherent beam with very high quality having enormous power.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      As described above, another reason why a large transmitter diameter is an important design feature involves atmospheric breakdown.
      <br/>
      By constructing the antenna with a large diameter, the flux (power density) of the beam passing through the atmosphere can be designed to be below the threshold where atmospheric breakdown occurs (between an altitude of 40 and 60 km).
      <br/>
      But, it will be capable of delivering a much higher power density at the vehicle several thousand kilometers above the atmosphere by focusing (see FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      By designing the microwave power generators to operate at variable power, the antenna's transmitted power density can be controlled to avoid atmospheric breakdown.
      <br/>
      The converging beam geometry enables the transmitted power to increase with increasing vehicle distance without increasing the power density at the breakdown altitude.

      As in the design of the microwave transmitter, the underground superconducting energy storage system can be designed to store virtually unlimited amounts of energy by utilizing large dimensions.
      <br/>
      In order to eliminate any fringe field, which would extend over a very large region, the system will be designed as a collection of superconducting toroids where the magnetic fields are confined within their interiors. (See, S. M. Schoenting and W. R. Meier, "A Comparison of Large-Scale Toroidal and Solenoidal SMES Systems," IEEE Transactions On Magnetics, Vol. 27, No. 2, March 1991, pp. 2324-2328.)

      A nested system having 10 or 20 such coils could easily exceed 1018 J, and this could be multiplied by an order of magnitude by employing deep tunnels with multiple levels.
      <br/>
      The tunnels could be bored by automated high-speed tunnel boring machines.

      Since the cost of large superconducting energy storage systems is proportional to E1/3, it is very cost effective to design the system with large dimensions.

      Since the inductive energy of the superconducting energy storage system is so great, it would be impractical to charge the coils using existing power plants.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the proposed magnetic propulsion system envisioned herein includes the construction of a large electric power generating system.
      <br/>
      This generating system could be photovoltaic solar arrays mounted around the transmitter covering a large area.
      <br/>
      A system covering an area of 2,000 km2 could generate an average annual output of about 25 GW at latitude 40 (degree) . But this would be very expensive to construct.
      <br/>
      An alternative system could be based upon Rosa-type, nuclear-electric, gas-core, closed-cycle MHD generators. (See, R. J. Rosa and L. N. Myrabo, "Ultra-Performance Closed-Cycle Gas Core Reactors For Orbit Raising," Orbit-Raising and Maneuvering Propulsion, Vol. 87, Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics, 1984, pp. 460-476, and I. Maya, "Ultrahigh Temperature Vapor-Core Reactor-Magnetohydrodynamic System for Space Nuclear Electric Power," Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 9, No. 1, Jan.-Feb., 1993, pp. 98-104.) These generators have the advantage of operating at extremely high power densities and require relatively few moving parts.
      <br/>
      Compact automated units could be designed to operate continuously at 10 GW.
      <br/>
      They could be designed and installed underground as modular unites around the storage coils.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of using Rosa generators is that waste heat is expelled radiatively, which could be utilized as a high temperature heat reservoir for secondary power generating systems to boost the total output power.
      <br/>
      They would be ideal for remote desert areas and for generating electric power on other celestial bodies.
      <br/>
      They have very low specific mass.
      <br/>
      Since the propulsion system could eject radioactive waste products out of the solar system for disposal at very low cost, all of the problems associated with radioactive waste disposal from nuclear power generating plants would be eliminated.
      <br/>
      Thus, the true economic potential of nuclear-electric power generation--$ 10-4 /KW-HR--could be realized. (Efficient hydroelectric generators can produce electrical energy at $10-3 /KW-HR.) Excess electrical energy not used for propelling vehicles could be fed into a power grid and sold to commercial utility companies.
      <br/>
      The superconducting energy storage system could be utilized as a large load-leveling system.
      <br/>
      By generating large amounts of electrical power (e.g., 100 GW or more), the revenue received by the sale of unused electrical energy could far exceed the cost of operating the space vehicles.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      It should also be pointed out that the electric power could also be generated by converting unlimited amounts of natural thermal energy into mechnical work to turn generators by using the Applicant's invention of closed-cycle cryogenic engines mentioned above. (See my U.S. Pat. No. 5,040,373 entitled "Condensing System And Operating Method" filed Oct. 27, 1989.) Since no radioactive materials are required, and since there is unlimited amounts of free natural thermal energy available, the cost of generating the electrical energy by this method would be virtually zero.
      <br/>
      However, since this system will require a considerable amount of research and development, it will be assumed that the electrical energy is generated by nuclear generators with a cost of $10-4 /KW-HR.

      High-speed vehicles returning to earth are initially decelerated by the traveling repulsive magnetic field.

      The energy efficiency and operating cost of this traveling field magnetic propulsion concept can be determined by introducing a parameter which will be called the specific launch energy.
      <br/>
      It will be defined as the total microwave energy E transmitted to magnetically accelerate a vehicle during a time interval T equal to  (Equation image '55' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="191">
      divided by the vehicle's total payload mass MP expressed as E/Mp.
      <br/>
      Since the electric-to-microwave D conversion efficiency is nearly 100% , this parameter is essentially equal to the electrical energy used to accelerate a unit mass of payload.
      <br/>
      It is therefore a good measure of the vehicle's energy efficiency.
      <br/>
      For suborbital flights, the amount of energy used to magnetically decelerate a vehicle above the landing site is approximately equal to E. Consequently, if the specific electrical energy production cost Ce ($/KW-HR) of the energy generation system is known, the electrical energy cost of a suborbital flight can be determined by multiplying this rate by 2E.
      <br/>
      Since the vehicles are single-stage and reusable, this cost is a good measure of the vehicle's flight cost.
      <br/>
      Omitting the cost of ware and maintenance, the total operating cost of a vehicle flight is equal to the cost of the electrical energy used by the transmitters and the cost of the L2 /LO2 chemical rocket propellant.
      <br/>
      The Lq/Lq propellant is manufactured using this electrical energy.
      <br/>
      Since the cost of the electrical energy is so low ($10-4 /KW-HR), the propellant cost will be negligible.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the total cost of a suborbital flight can be expressed as 2EC, and the cost of transporting a unit mass of payload in the vehicle will be 2(E/Mp)Ce. If the mass of a passenger is denoted by mp, the transportation cost would be 2(E/Mp)mp Ce. Since flights to orbiting space stations do not require any deceleration, the passenger cost is expressed as (E/Mp)mp Ce. For trips to the Moon and other celestial bodies, the passenger cost is approximately 2(E/Mp)mp Ce where, for simplicity, it is assumed that the energy production cost is essentially equal to the cost of the fissionable material used in the electric generating system. (Since the amount of fissionable fuel consumed in nuclear-electric generators is very small, its transportation cost to other celestial bodies is negligible.).

The mass ratio R34 of the retro rocket landing trajectories given in Table 9 will range between 1.0154 and 1.0217. Consequently, the total mass ratios Rt =R01 xR12 R23 xR34 corresponding to these suborbital flights ranges between 1.615 and 1.643.

      The significance of this Table becomes more apparent when one compares the results with the performance capabilities of advanced long-range commercial airliners such as the 747SP (superperformance).
      <br/>
      These aircraft (with a gross mass of about 300 MT) have a maximum range of about 10,000 miles, burn 145 MT of fuel, and require flight times of 17.4 hours.
      <br/>
      The corresponding payload for this distance is about 13 MT and the mass ratio is approximately 1.94. (See, R. Redding and B. Yenne, Boeing: Planemaker to the World, Crescent Books, 1983, pp. 202, 203.) Table 10 shows that a 1000 m diameter microwave transmitter, which could be constructed near a large airport, could accelerate a 100 m diameter vehicle with 30 times more payload, carrying 1,000 passengers over the same distance utilizing a suborbital trajectory in less than two hours.
      <br/>
      Deceleration is accomplished by a similar transmitter located at the landing site, and atmospheric breaking.
      <br/>
      The total mass ratio is only 1.643. Assuming that the nuclear-electric generating system operates at $10-4 /KW-HR, the cost of the electrical energy used for acceleration and deceleration is $1.32/kg. Consequently, if the average passenger mass is 100 kg, the per passenger cost of the flight would be about $264.

    <p num="198">
      Table 11 gives the payload mass Mp, total mass ratio Rt, total flight time TFT, and the specific launch energy E/Mp for flights to the Moon with various vehicle/transmitter combinations.
      <br/>
      For these flights (and all interplanetary flights), the magnetic acceleration trajectories can be assumed to be a continuation of the vertical launch trajectory.
      <br/>
      In view of the high approach velocities, it can be assumed that the vehicles approach the lunar landing site along a vertical trajectory and decelerated by a microwave transmitter having sufficient power.
      <br/>
      Since there is no atmosphere on the Moon, the microwave transmitter could operate at much higher power densities.
      <br/>
      The power is gradually increased to take into consideration the increasing limar gravity so that the deceleration is constant and equal to 1.5 g (14.715 m/sec2).
      <br/>
      The deceleration is designed to slow the vehicle to zero velocity one or two kilometers above the landing site.
      <br/>
      The landing deceleration could be accomplished by retro rocket propulsion, or by magnetic repulsive forces generated by a superconducting solenoid constructed around the landing site, or by a combination of these two methods.
      <br/>
      The trajectory calculations were carried out by numerically integrating the equation of motion (46) where the vehicle moves continuously under the influence of the earth and Moon acting simultaneously. (The reason why most of the payloads MP given in Table 11 are greater than the corresponding values given in Table 10, is due to the fact that the beam elevation angles corresponding to the suborbital trajectories in Table 10 are not 90.

      The most remarkable characteristic of the passenger-carrying flights to the Moon described in Table 11 is the short flight times and low mass ratios.
      <br/>
      They are actually lower than those of long-range commercial airliners traveling between two widely seperated cities.
      <br/>
      This is the key operating characteristic of the present invention that will make commercial space travel possible.
      <br/>
      The Table shows that a 1,000 m diameter transmitter could accelerate the same 100 m diameter vehicle used for suborbital flights, all the way to the Moon in only 7.86 hours, which is less than half the 17.4 hours of flight time required for a 747SP to travel 10,000 miles.
      <br/>
      And, the vehicle could carry 1,000 passengers at a cost of about $500/passenger.
      <br/>
      Since the flight times are so short, the same vehicles used for suborbital flights could be used for trips to the Moon (or trips to orbiting space stations) essentially without any modification.
      <br/>
      Since the electric generating system could produce electrical energy so cheaply, the cost of the launch energy could be recovered by the sale of excess power to utility companies.
      <br/>
      Thus, the actual operating cost of the vehicles would be very low.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since the cost of operating the propulsion system could be substantially less than the revenue received from the sale of excess electrical energy to utility companies, the passenger cost could be set at any level--even zero--and the system could still operate at a profit.
    </p>
    <p num="201">
      In order to construct the magnetic propulsion system on the Moon's surface, large quantities of cargo would have to be transported from the earth.
      <br/>
      Since the mass ratios of the magnetic propulsion system are so low, the maximum payloads that could be delivered by each vehicle/transmitter combination are close to those given in Table 5.
      <br/>
      When the vehicle approaches the Moon, the cargo is removed in modules and landed independently via retro rocket propulsion while the vehicle swings around the Moon and returns to earth on a low-energy, non-stop, free-fall, round-trip trajectory.
      <br/>
      Transmitting systems could be constructed on other celestial bodies by delivering the components using the same method.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      Table 12 gives the maximum payload mass Mp (MT) that the vehicles could transport to Mars on free-fall, round-trip, interplanetary trajectories with hyperbolic excess velocity equal to 3.5 km/sec. The total mass ratios R, and the corresponding specific launch energies E/Mp (J/kg) are also given.
      <br/>
      Since the vehicles are carrying cargo with few passengers, the maximum acceleration am of the rocket propelled launch trajectory can be taken to be 3.5 g so that the corresponding mass ratio R01 =1.499. By taking advantage of atmospheric breaking at Mars using very large parachutes, a fairly large fraction of the payload mass Mp could be useful cargo.

      This Table shows that all of these vehicles will be capable of taking off from the earth's surface, accelerating to very high escape velocities for a voyage through the solar system and landing on another planet (or satellite thereof) with mass ratios that are lower than that of long range commercial airliners.
      <br/>
      In the case of the 200 m diameter vehicle carrying several thousand passengers accelerated by a 10 km diameter transmitter, escape velocities exceeding 76 km/sec will be possible with a specific launch energy of 6.38 * 1011 J/kg.
      <br/>
      Omitting the cost of food and the deceleration energy cost, the passenger cost for the voyage would be about $1,770.
      <br/>
      This is equivalent to the cost of a transatlantic flight on a Concord SST airliner.

      If the vehicles are accelerated at 2.0 g and/or the diameter of the transmitter is increased, it will be possible to achieve escape velocities exceeding 100 km/sec.

      The Table shows that by accelerating vehicles to very high velocities (V (infinity) .apprxeq.100 km/sec), trips through the inner solar system, to Mercury, Venus and Mars, could be achieved with trip-times only a few days longer than those of transatlantic ocean liners.
      <br/>
      Although trips to Jupiter and Saturn would require a few months, these trip-times are comparable to summer cruises.
      <br/>
      Shorter trip-times to Uranus, Neptune and Pluto could be achieved by accelerating vehicles beyond the full power range of the transmitter to reach higher velocities.

      Since the electrical energy used to generate the traveling magnetic fields could be obtained very inexpensively by nuclear-electric closed-cycle MHD generators (or by the Applicant's closed-cycle cryogenic engines described in my U.S. Pat. No. 5,040,373), it will be possible to operate these vehicles at a cost below that of large ocean-going luxury liners.
      <br/>
      Consequently, since the trip-times would approximate ocean voyages with comparable fares, this propulsion concept would make large-scale commercial interplanetary space travel possible.
      <br/>
      And this would open the entire solar system to colonization.
    </p>
    <p num="213">I would like to make some concluding remarks in setting forth the present propulsion system in order to clearly distinguish it from all prior art propulsion systems designed for space travel.</p>
    <p num="214">
      First and foremost, the fundamental problem of finding a propulsion method (a propulsion concept) for achieving high-speed manned space travel required for commercial interplanetary flight through the solar system by ordinary individuals is presently believed to be far beyond any possible solution with current technology.
      <br/>
      Although it is possible to design vehicles propelled by advanced nuclear propulsion systems for achieving high-speed interplanetary space travel for the distant future, these vehicles could not be operated directly from the earth's surface because of inherently low thrust-to-weight ratios.
      <br/>
      The danger of contaminating large areas with radioactive debris resulting from a possible accident also excludes these vehicles from operating directly from the earth's surface.
      <br/>
      Consequently, even if such vehicles are developed in the distant future, they could only be operated between orbiting space stations, and their construction (in orbit) would be very expensive.
      <br/>
      Trips to the Moon and other celestial bodies would require the tedium of having to use three different transportation systems, each of which would be fairly expensive to operate, and would be limited to relatively small payloads.
      <br/>
      Several hundred passengers waiting in an orbiting space station to board a high-speed transfer vehicle for a flight to another space station orbiting the Moon or Mars would require very large and very expensive space stations.
    </p>
    <p num="215">
      This disclosure introduces a new propulsion concept that has the potential for circumventing the technical barriers to commercial interplanetary space travel by a wide margin.
      <br/>
      The concept is based on designing the vehicle in the form of a streamlined toroidal airfoil containing a thin-walled superconducting solenoid having the same mean radius, launching it vertically from the earth's surface to a low altitude vacuum environment with relatively little conventional rocket propulsion, and creating a traveling repulsive magnetic field behind the vehicle to accelerate it by magnetic repulsive forces.
      <br/>
      The traveling repulsive magnetic field is created by ejecting an easily ionizable, low-density gas cloud in the vehicle's magnetic field, and exciting it with a plane-polarized microwave beam tuned to the electron cyclotron resonate frequency transmitted from the earth's surface.
      <br/>
      The gas is ionized and the free electrons are pumped into high-energy resonant cyclotron orbits, which, in their aggregate, generate a very large repulsive magnetic field that travels behind the vehicle.
      <br/>
      By constructing the transmitter horizontally as a large multiple-feed, electronically-steered, phased array, energized by a system of superconducting energy storage coils, virtually unlimited power could be transmitted to achieve essentially any thrust-to-weight ratio desired.
      <br/>
      By utilizing very high microwave frequencies and focusing techniques, it will be possible to magnetically accelerate circular, coil-carrying vehicles over great distances to reach very high earth escape velocities with mass ratios close to the theoretical limit of 1 0 (slashed zero)  Since the acceleration trajectories have high inclinations, only one transmitter is required to accelerate the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The same transmitter could be used to decelerate a high-speed vehicle returning to earth.
    </p>
    <p num="216">
      An important feature of this propulsion concept is the fact that all of the required operating systems needed to construct it already exist.
      <br/>
      The performance possibilities of even relatively small systems (such as 50 m diameter vehicles and a one kilometer diameter transmitter) are quite significant.
      <br/>
      Such a system would be capable of transporting enormous amounts of payload to orbit, to the Moon, or to other celestial bodies at a cost approximately equal to the cost of the electrical energy used to generate the traveling repulsive magnetic field.
      <br/>
      Since it will be possible to use the propulsion system to eject radioactive waste products out of the solar system, the electrical energy could be generated by automated nuclear power plants (such as radiatively cooled Rosa type, closed-cycle, MHD generators) at very low cost.
      <br/>
      This would enable payloads to be transported at a cost comparable to that of transatlantic air cargo.
    </p>
    <p num="217">
      Since the propulsion system would enable large amounts of payload to be transported anywhere in the solar system at very low cost, it would be possible to use an initial earth-based system to transport cargo to construct superconducting storage coils and microwave transmitters on the Moon and on other celestial bodies.
      <br/>
      Since no onboard power generating system is required to magnetically accelerate the vehicles, they are able to operate directly between the surfaces of those celestial bodies equipped with these systems.
      <br/>
      One of the most remarkable features of this propulsion concept is the possibility that large vehicles could be launched directly from the earth's surface, accelerated onto an interplanetary trajectory through the solar system with an escape velocity of 100 km/sec, decelerated, and landed directly on the surface of another planet (or satellite thereof) with a total mass ratio lower than that of long-range commercial airliners.
    </p>
    <p num="218">
      The attainable velocities are so high that the flight times between the inner planets would be only a few days and comparable to that of voyages on transatlantic ocean liners.
      <br/>
      But the peak acceleration loads are very low (e.g., 1.5 g), and easily tolerated by ordinary passengers.
    </p>
    <p num="219">
      Since the injection velocities are so high, there is no need to accelerate the vehicles along the interplanetary trajectories.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is no need for the vehicles to carry any major energy generating system for primary propulsion other than that required for guidance (which could be provided by the chemical launch propulsion system).
      <br/>
      Consequently, the basic design of the vehicles is fairly simple, making it relatively easy to construct vehicles having diameters of several hundred meters containing toroidal passenger cabins to accommodate several thousand passengers.
      <br/>
      By rotating these cabins inside the vehicles, an earth-like, artificial-gravity environment can be created.
      <br/>
      This rotation also gives the vehicle gyroscopic spin stability which prevents the vehicle from flipping over due to magnetic torque.
    </p>
    <p num="220">
      If the electrical energy could be generated at a cost of $10-4 /KW-HR (achievable with automated nuclear power plants) the cost of high-speed flights through the solar system would approximate that of long-range commercial airliners.
      <br/>
      Excess electrical energy not needed for propulsion could be sold to utility companies to generate additional revenue.
      <br/>
      It is conceivable that such revenue could far exceed the cost of operating the vehicles.
      <br/>
      The system would enable commercial interplanetary space travel to become a practical reality.
      <br/>
      And this could lead to the colonization of the solar system on a scale previously believed to be far beyond technical possibility.
    </p>
    <p num="221">
      From the foregoing description, it will thus be evident that the present invention provides a vastly improved method for propelling vehicles for achieving ultra high-speed travel between widely seperated cities and economical space travel.
