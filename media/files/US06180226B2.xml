    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to a method of forming a monolayer of particles, and to products formed thereby.
      <br/>
      It is particularly concerned with forming an ordered array of particles in a monolayer, which may be incorporated into a film.
      <br/>
      Films formed by the inventive method have anisotropic conductive pathways formed by ordered arrays of conductive particles, and are especially useful in interconnection technology in the electronics industry.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The invention is also useful in other fields of technology and may be applied to particles which are not electrically conductive.</p>

      JP 62-127 194 of Fujikura Cable Works KK describes the production of anisotropic conductive solder sheets by forming an adhesive coating having a thickness of less than 10 micrometers on a support film, applying soft solder powder having a grain size of 10-50 micrometers onto the adhesive coating, and filling the spaces between granules of the solder with a plastic material.
      <br/>
      It is stated that the soft solder granules can be evenly dispersed in the plastic material on the film.
      <br/>
      However, application of particles onto an adhesive film to which the particles adhere on contact is not believed likely to achieve satisfactory dispersion or ordering of the particles in the plane of the film.

      EP 0 691 660 A1 of Hitachi Chemical Co.
      <br/>
      Ltd. describes an anisotropically electro-conductive film material produced by adhering electro-conductive particles to an adhering layer formed on a support and fixing the particles therein, and then introducing a film-forming resin incompatible with the adhering material between the electro-conductive particles, the film material having electro-conductivity only in the film thickness direction via the electro-conductive particles uniformly dispersed in the plane direction.
      <br/>
      The particles may be arranged in a grid or zig zag pattern in the plane by means of a film, net or screen having holes therein ("screen"), through which the particles are fixed on the adhering layer.
      <br/>
      The particles and the screen may be electrostatically charged with different electric charges.
      <br/>
      However problems exist in the use of such a screen, including difficulty in producing and handling thin screens, and making the desired patterns of holes.
      <br/>
      An individual screen would be required for each pattern.
      <br/>
      Also it would be difficult to (1) ensure that all of the holes are filled by particles and (2) guard against clogging of at least some of the holes by the adhesive material.
      <br/>
      Removal of the screen may also cause disruption of the pattern.
      <br/>
      The use of electrostatic charging would be a complex procedure involving large electrical fields.

      U.S. Pat. No. 5,221,417 (Basavanhally) describes the use of photolithographic masking and etching to form a matrix array of mutually isolated ferromagnetic elements.
      <br/>
      These elements are magnetized and a single layer of conductive ferromagnetic particles is adhered to an upper surface of each of the ferromagnetic elements, so that the conductive particles are in an array.
      <br/>
      The layer of particles is then contacted with a layer of soft adhesive polymer to cause penetration of the particles into the polymer.
      <br/>
      The adhesive polymer is then hardened to assure containment of the particles in the polymer.
      <br/>
      The adhesive polymer containing the conductive particles is used for interconnecting conductor arrays.
      <br/>
      However, it is believed that this technique may be used only with conductive particles which are ferromagnetic.
      <br/>
      Such particles may be difficult to obtain in specific shapes, sizes and types (e.g., monodisperse spheres.)

      The particles are aligned via the interaction of an applied magnetic field with the electrically conductive particles.
      <br/>
      The invention relies on the use of magnetic particles as the conductors, and so has no utility in the preparation of ordered arrays of non-magnetic and substantially non-magnetic particles or in the preparation of systems in which ordered arrays are transferred from one substrate to another.

      Examples of the liquid include a curable liquid composition, a mixture of a curable liquid composition and a liquid carrier in which the ferromagnetic particles have been suspended, or a non-curable carrier liquid, provided the electrically-conductive particles have a latent adhesive property.

      In this application, a method of making an anisotropically-conductive bond between two sets of conductors is also described.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="22">
      The present invention provides methods for producing monolayered random and ordered arrays of particles which are maintained in place by use of a cured tack layer.
      <br/>
      These methods employ a curable matrix in which the particles are dispersed and the curable matrix is partially cured to form a thin film which maintains the particles in place but does not substantially encase the particles.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The present invention also provides methods for producing films from such particle-containing curable matrices where the particles are maintained and contained within a film.
      <br/>
      In these methods, the monolayers of particles are backfilled with a film-forming material which substantially encases and securely maintains in place the particles.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The present invention further provides a method of producing such ordered arrays and films prepared therefrom by use of a curable ferrofluid exposed to a magnetic field where the so-formed arrays and films are free or substantially free of ferrofluid or ferromagnetic particles.
      <br/>
      The particles may be transferred from the cured ferrofluid to an adhesive or latent adhesive free of the ferromagnetic particles.
    </p>
    <p num="25">The present invention still further provides for the preparation of ordered arrays and films containing the ordered array of particles by use of standard ferrofluids or ferrofluid waxes, where the ordered array is maintained in place by (1) pressing the ordered array in the ferrofluid or ferrofluid wax and (2) then transferring it under pressure upon the particles, and optionally under heat, to an adhesive, latent adhesive or film-forming material.</p>
    <p num="26">In addition, the present invention also provides for monolayer random and ordered arrays of particles and films prepared therefrom in accordance with the methods disclosed herein.</p>
    <p num="27">The present invention also provides for an article having a support tape substrate and an ordered monolayer array of transferable particles temporarily bound thereto as well as to an article having a sequential laminae of a first substrate, an adhesive matrix entraining an ordered monolayer array of particles and a second substrate joined to the first substrate by the adhesive matrix.</p>
    <p num="28">This invention pertains to a method of forming an anisotropic conducting bond between a first set of conductors and a second set of conductors.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="31">
      The present invention provides generally methods of forming a monolayer of particles.
      <br/>
      One such method ("method A") includes applying to a substrate a curable composition having particles contained therein having a particle size on at least one dimension thereof of at least 1 micrometer; and exposing the particle-containing curable composition to a source of energy suitable for effecting polymerization of the curable composition for a sufficient time to effect polymerization of a layer of the curable composition having a thickness of no more than about 50% of the height of the largest particles; optionally, the method also includes removing the uncured curable composition, if any remains.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The source of energy for effecting cure or polymerization may suitably be any source of electromagnetic heat radiation or particularly actinic radiation, including ultraviolet (UV), infra red, visible, X-ray or gamma ray, E-beam or microwave.
      <br/>
      The time of exposure should be chosen by those persons skilled in the art, depending upon the source of energy, the exposure conditions, the depth of cure desired, the properties of the curable composition (such as, its ability to absorb of the chosen energy) and the structure confining the composition.
      <br/>
      In the case of UV light, an exposure time of about 0.1 to about 1 seconds may suffice.
      <br/>
      Desirably, the exposure time should be the minimum required to produce a layer or film of cured material in which the particles are maintained.
      <br/>
      This layer or film is referred to as the "tack layer", and the tack layer with the particles attached thereto is referred to as the "tacked array", both of which are distinguished from, although may be a part of, the particle containing film, referred to as the "film", which is produced in accordance with the methods of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The particles employed in the present invention should have a particle size of at least one micrometer on at least one dimension thereof.
      <br/>
      These particles are referred to as "the substantive particles".
    </p>
    <p num="34">In various aspects, the invention provides:</p>
    <p num="35">
      B.
      <br/>
      A method of forming a film having a monolayer of particles contained therein.
      <br/>
      This method includes applying to a substrate a curable composition particles containing having a particle size of at least one dimension thereof of at least 1 micrometer; exposing the particle-containing curable composition to a source of energy suitable for effecting polymerization of the curable composition for a sufficient time to effect polymerization of a layer of the curable composition having a thickness of no more than about 50% of the height of the largest particles; removing the uncured curable composition; and applying a film-forming material to fill the interstitial spaces between the particles.
      <br/>
      The so-applied film-forming material may also cover areas of the substrate flanking the particles to a film-thickness similar to that of the particle-containing areas.
      <br/>
      In addition, the film-forming material may be at least partially solidified, also the so-formed film may be removed from the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      C. A method of forming a monolayer of particles.
      <br/>
      This method includes applying to a substrate a curable composition containing particles having a particle size of at least one dimension thereof of at least 1 micrometer; exposing the particle-containing curable composition to a source of energy suitable for effecting polymerization of the curable composition for a sufficient time to effect polymerization of a layer of the curable composition having a thickness of no more than 50% of the height of the largest particles; applying an adhesive film over the surface of the particles, remote from the layer of cured composition; pressing the adhesive film onto the particles; and separating the adhesive film with the particles adhering thereto away from the layer of cured composition.
      <br/>

      The film-forming material should be an adhesive material.

      A single film-forming material should be sufficient to manufacture the films in accordance with the present invention.

      In addition, two or more layers of different film-forming materials may also be appropriate to apply to the particles, such as a first layer of film-forming material which may be adhesive (e.g. an elastomer) and a second layer of adhesive film-forming material.
      <br/>
      The second layer may have been formed with the additional step of separating the film formed by solidification of the film-forming material with the particles therein away from the layer of polymerized curable composition, the tack layer, and then applying a layer of adhesive material over the so-exposed surface of the film.

      The invention provides a bi-layer film which includes a layer of thermoset material and a layer of thermoplastic material.

      The layer of thermoset material may be either the tack layer with a secondary or latent adhesive cure system (B-stage mechanism) therein, or a layer of thermoset backfill material with a thickness not more than about 50% of the height of the largest particles.
      <br/>
      The layer of thermoplastic material may be backfill material with a thickness of about 50% or more of the height of the largest particles, so that the total thickness of the film is about equal to the height of the largest particles.

      The thermoset layer maintains in position the arrayed particles while the thermoplastic layer may be reworked, such as by use of heat.
      <br/>
      For example, if the bi-layer film is applied with the thermoset layer adhering to an electronic device and the thermoplastic layer adhering to a printed circuit board, the thermoplastic layer allows a reworking function if the parts need to be disassembled for repair or repositioning or re-use, while the ordering of the arrayed particles is maintained.
      <br/>
      In a reuse operation, a new layer of thermoplastic material need only be applied to the circuit board, not to the electrical device, which is of much smaller size.

      Alternatively, after removing the uncured material, a layer of thermoset material may be backfilled followed by application of a layer of thermoplastic.

      A film having a monolayer non-random array of particles therein may be prepared from the methods of J, K, and O by employing a substrate where the adhesive or latent adhesive is a solidifiable film-forming material and the particles are pressed into the adhesive.
      <br/>
      The film-forming material should be in a liquid or penetrable state so as to allow the particles to penetrate into the film-forming material, with the film-forming materials filling the interstitial spaces between the particles.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the film-forming material should be at least about 50% of the height of the largest particles, desirably at least about 95% of the height of the largest particles, not thicker than about 200% of the height of the largest particle, which is about 125% of the height of the largest particle.
      <br/>
      A thickness in the range of from about from 95% to about 105% of the height of the largest particle, such as 95% to 100% of the height of the largest particle, generally provides beneficial results.
      <br/>
      Here the particles are intended to fully or substantially penetrate into the adhesive or latent adhesive material which is used as a film-forming material.
      <br/>
      This contrasts to other aspects of the present invention where the adhesive or latent adhesive is not a film-forming material or is intended only to tack the particles onto the surface thereof.
      <br/>
      In such case, the particles should penetrate to a depth of no more than about 25% of the height of the largest particles.

    <p num="73">
      In the method of O and P, in order to prevent too much intermixing of the ferrofluid wax and the adhesive, latent adhesive or film-forming material, the ferrofluid wax may be removed as the particles are pressed into the adhesive, latent adhesive or film-forming material.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, one may employ an adhesive, latent adhesive, or film-forming material having a viscosity, under the softening or melt temperature of the ferrofluid wax, substantially higher than that of the ferrofluid wax but not so high as to make it difficult for the particles to penetrate the same.
      <br/>
      Still, the temperature may be varied so as to activate the adhesive characteristics of the latent adhesive at a temperature which is substantially the same as the "softening point" or melting point of the ferrofluid wax.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the softening point is that temperature at which the ferrofluid wax is sufficiently pliable or flowable under minor pressure to allow for the easy and ready transfer of the particles from the ferrofluid wax to the adhesive, latent adhesive or film-forming material, as appropriate.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      In the method of J through P, the ferrofluid and ferrofluid waxes may be reused or recycled for subsequent reuse.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the ferrofluid is not incorporated into the film, the films can be made transparent or translucent so as to allow for ease of positioning of the formed film on a substrate in its intended end use.
      <br/>
      This may also be attained by the method of D and H, as well as by the method of B and F provided the tack layer is sufficiently thin or is removed after backfilling.

    <p num="77">
      Solidification of the film-forming material (and optionally also the curable tack layer composition) generally involves two stages, an A-stage and a B-stage.
      <br/>
      The A-stage, or primary solidification, has the function of producing a film with the particles maintained in place which is capable of being handled.
      <br/>
      The A-stage may involve a primary cure, e.g., by photocure, heat, or E-beam.
      <br/>
      Solvent evaporation, cooling (in particular from a melt), chemical reaction (e.g., polymerization), physical association phenomena and the like are also acceptable means of effecting viscosity increases to an effectively solid A-staged condition.
      <br/>
      The B-stage which occurs during end-use application of the film may use thermoplastic properties of the A-staged film or coating, but desirably involves a cure, for example to a thermoset condition.
      <br/>
      When the A-stage solidification has been effected by a primary cure, the B-stage cure is a secondary cure which may use the same or a different cure mechanism from that of the A-stage.

      Ceramic, epoxy composite, polyimide films and the like represent other forms of substrates which may include conductive tracks.

    <p num="92">
      In the case of ITO-coated glass substrates, the tack layer of the curable composition is suitably rendered susceptible to photopolymerization, and is cured by irradiation through the transparent substrate, with actinic (UV) radiation.
      <br/>
      Exposure conditions may be selected such that only a layer of the curable composition solidifies.
      <br/>
      After removal of uncured material, a backfilling material is then applied and cured (primary cure or A-stage).
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Alternatively, backfilling is not necessary if a film forming material is to be applied intermediate the ITO-coated glass substrate and the substrate to which it is to be mated concurrently with or prior to mating or if the second substrate has a pre-applied coating of a solidifiable film forming material on its surface.
      <br/>
      The solidifiable film-forming material should either be a liquid or in a softened or pliable state, such that as the substrates are mated and pressed together, the particles penetrate through the solidifiable film forming materials until contact is made with the surface of the second substrate.

      Similar methods are appropriate in the case of substrates which are non-transmissive to UV or visible radiation but which are transmissive to other forms of electromagnetic radiation.

      In such case, the initiator systems in the curable compositions may require modification.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a pre-formed "patch" of film according to the invention may be applied to the electrically-addressable substrate.
      <br/>
      In either case, the backfill composition contains a latent thermal hardener or other B-stage cure system so that it has latent adhesive properties.

      The resulting products can be used for device interconnection to flat panel displays of various types, or direct die attachment, using "flip chip" techniques in the case of a coated and subdivided wafer.

      The average particle size of the substantive particles should be at least about 10 times that of the colloidal-size ferromagnetic particles, more particularly at least about 100 times, and advantageously at least about 500 times.
      <br/>
      The substantive particles have an average particle size (measured on the minor dimension in the case of non-symmetrical particles) of at least about 2 micrometers while the colloidal ferromagnetic particles have an average particle size not greater than about 0.1 micrometers, such as about 0.01 micrometers.

      For electronic interconnection uses, the interconnection pads generally have a width in the range of about 10 to about 500 micrometers, suitably is about 100 micrometers.

      The separation between the pads generally is less than about 150 micrometers, such as about 100 micrometers.
      <br/>
      The present invention facilitates pitch or separation reduction below about 100 micrometers, even to about 10 micrometers or less.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      The substantive particles may be arrayed in a regular pattern in a monolayer.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the uncured curable composition on the substrate should be desirably regulated (e.g., by compression, squeegee, and the like) before cure so that essentially all of the particles (or at least the largest particles) are in substantially the same plane.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The substantive particles should have substantially uniform sizes and shapes.
      <br/>
      Substantial uniformity is not affected by the presence of smaller than average particles (which may not function as conductive particles in the film) or larger than average particles (which may be compressible and/or otherwise capable of size reduction in the conditions of production of the film or coating, e.g., solder particles which may melt or deform).
      <br/>
      The size distribution for solder powder particles is defined according to test methods of the Institute for Interconnecting and Packaging Electronic Circuits, Lincolnwood, Ill. 60646-1705, U.S.A. For example, in Table 1 below distributions from test method IPC-TM-650 are presented:

      The substantive particles should be compliant when pressed upon, either during preparation of the film, or during its end-use application.
      <br/>
      Such compliancy facilitates greater than single point contact and enables compensations for small variations in particle size or substrate flatness.
      <br/>
      This is particularly desirable in the preparation of electrically-conductive films.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      The thickness of the film should be substantially the same as the average diameter of the substantive particles.
      <br/>
      In the event the particles are of two or more groups of different sizes, particles belonging to the group of larger particles should be of substantially uniform size and the thickness of the film should be in relation to the average diameter of that largest group of particles.
      <br/>
      During exposure to the magnetic field, the thickness of the layer of curable ferrofluid composition may be greater than the average diameter of the substantive particles, although ordinarily the thickness should be less than twice the average diameter.
      <br/>
      In this way, each particle may be surrounded by the carrier liquid and may migrate in the layer of the composition.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      After backfilling, pressure may be applied to the material to reduce the thickness so that the substantive particles lie at, or protrude slightly from, both surfaces of the film.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the thickness of the film may be reduced by shrinkage during the A-stage, e.g. as a result of cure or drying.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      If the particles are compressible spheres, the thickness of the film may be reduced by compression to less than the average diameter of the electrically-conductive particles.
      <br/>
      In so doing, the particles may be compressed into a non-circular cross-sectional shape and the area of electrical contact on the surface of each particle thereby increased.
      <br/>
      Compression of individual particles to different degrees of compression may also compensate for some variations in particle size and flatness of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The compressibility of electrically-conductive particles having a core of polymeric material coated with an electrically-conductive metal will be a degree of dependent upon the extent of cross-linking of the polymer.
      <br/>
      Gold-coated spherical polystyrene particles �supplied by Sekisui Fine Chemical Co, Osaka, Japan under the name AU 212, (which were found to have an average diameter of 11.5 micrometers) compressed on the Z-axis under 3.3 MPa pressure were found to have a Z-axis dimension of 10.5 micrometers, ie., an aspect ratio (Z/X) of 0.79 corresponding to an 8.7% contraction on the Z-axis.

    <p num="106">
      Generally, the uniform magnetic field is applied normal to the layer of the curable composition (i.e. in the Z direction) and the substantive particles form a regular array of particles in a monolayer.
      <br/>
      With a monolayer, there is primarily single-particle bridging in the Z direction between two sets of conductors (when the film is used between two sets of conductors).
      <br/>
      The regular pattern improves the reliability of electrical contact.
      <br/>
      The magnetic field may be applied parallel to the layer of the curable composition (e.g. the X direction) and the substantive particles form parallel chains of particles, each in contact with an adjacent particle or particles of the same chain.
      <br/>
      The chains are formed to lie parallel to the longitudinal axis of two sets of conductor pins or tracks.
      <br/>
      Here again, single-particle bridging in the Z-direction is achieved between the two sets of conductors.
      <br/>
      The particles, however, are also in electrical contact with adjacent particles in the same chain so that reliability is further improved.
    </p>
    <p num="107">In the case where two separate sets of conductor pins or tracks are located on opposite edges of an integrated circuit or other component, the layer of the composition will normally be interrupted at a central area of the component so that no conductive chain of particles extends across the width of the component to connect the two sets of conductors on the same component (unless desired).</p>
    <p num="108">
      In the case of a "quad" component having conductor pins on four edges, with two sets at right angles to the other two sets, the layer of the composition is applied, exposed to the magnetic field and cured in the tack layer in two steps, so that chains of conductive particles are formed in the X-direction and Y-direction with the appropriate alignments and interruptions in the respective areas.
      <br/>
      Screen printing of the composition and/or the use of masks, for example, may facilitate this operation.
      <br/>
      With those areas in which particle chains of one direction are desired are screen printed and cured, followed by a second screen printing step and cure for particles in the other direction.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, those areas in which a different direction or orientation of the particle chains is desired may be masked during curing or polymerization, with subsequent curing or the previously masked area.
    </p>
    <p num="109">Where a magnetic field is used normal to the layer of the composition, no significant alignment in the X-direction or Y-direction occurs, so that no interruption of the layer of the composition or double alignment step is needed.</p>

      For backfilling the layer of film forming material is desirably less than about 125% of the height of the largest particle and desirably of a thickness within the range of from about 95% to about 110% of the height of the largest particle, such as from about 95% to about 100% of the height of the largest particle.
      <br/>
      These ratios may vary depending upon the depth to which the particles penetrate the tack layer or adhesive film.

      After cure or A-stage cure, the carrier film or substrate may be removed.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the carrier fiber or substrate may be removed just prior to use of the so-formed film in its intended end-use application.
    </p>
    <p num="121">The carrier film may also be a latent adhesive or have a layer of adhesive or latent adhesive material on the face opposite the film-forming material so that in use, the adhesive or latent adhesive is activated to bond the film to a second substrate and the carrier film itself should be sufficiently pliable or penetrable to allow the particles to penetrate therethrough in assembling a device, particularly an electronic device, with the film.</p>

      The monomer composition at which the ferrofluid is comprised may include two polymerizable systems, one of which cures wholly or partially in the A-stage or primary solidification, and the second of which cures in the B-stage (accompanied by further curing of the first system, if appropriate).
      <br/>
      Alternatively or additionally, the monomers themselves may be hybrids having more than one reactive or curable functionality, such as an epoxy acrylate.

      Depending upon the end-use application of the products of the present invention, the particles may be conductive or non-conductive.
      <br/>
      That is the particles may conductive, whether thermally or electrically conductive, or optically transmissive.
      <br/>
      Those persons skilled in the art should recognize the wide-range applicability of this invention and should choose appropriate particles for the intended result, e.g., glass or transparent/translucent polymer particles for optical transmission; carbon, carbon black, alumina, zinc oxide, magnesium oxide and ferric oxide for thermal conductivity; and silver, copper, gold, nickel and the like for electric conductivity.
      <br/>
      Alloy particles, especially solders, may also be used as electrically conductive particles.
      <br/>
      The '558 patent describes solder powder whose particle size is less than 37 micrometers and preferably less than 15 micrometers.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="125">
      However, for electronic applications, the substantive particles should be electrically conductive and substantially non-magnetic.
      <br/>
      The term non-magnetic as used herein means that each particle has no significant net magnetic dipole.
      <br/>
      A particle with a "non-magnetic" core may have a coating of a metal (such as, nickel) which is ferromagnetic in nature.
      <br/>
      But in view of the small volume of the coating, the net magnetic moment per unit volume of the particle is not significant.
      <br/>
      The substantially non-magnetic particles do not typically respond to magnetic fields in environments which themselves are not susceptible to magnetic fields, such as a non-ferromagnetic liquid medium.
      <br/>
      Suitable particles may be constructed entirely of conductive materials or they may have a non-magnetic non-conductive core, such as of a plastics material like polystyrene, or of glass, coated with an electrically-conductive metal like nickel, silver or gold.
      <br/>
      A core of conductive material, such as graphite or a metal, may also be used.
      <br/>
      The core may optionally be hollow, such as a hollow glass sphere with an outer coating of a conductive material.
      <br/>
      Particles of carbon fiber or solder may also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      The substantive particles may suitably have a size in the range of about 1 to about 300 micrometers.
      <br/>
      Spherical particles are desirable but other spheroidal shapes, elongated shapes, cylindrical shapes, regular shapes, such as cubic or fibrous structures, may also be used.
      <br/>
      For spherical particles, a diameter in the range of about 2 to about 100 micrometers is desirable, such as about 2 to about 50 micrometers, particularly about 5 to about 30 micrometers or about 5 to about 20 micrometers.
    </p>
    <p num="127">For particles having a major dimension and a minor dimension, the major dimension is desirably in the range of about 2 to about 300 micrometers and the minor dimension is desirably in the range of about 2 to about 100 micrometers, such as 2-50 micrometers, particularly 5-30 micrometers, or 5-20 micrometers, with the aspect ratio being in the range of about 15/1 to about 1/1, more particularly 10/1 to 1/1.</p>
    <p num="128">
      In the case of fibrous structures, an aspect ratio of up to about 50/1 may be acceptable.
      <br/>
      If used, fibres should be of substantially uniform length (e.g. in the form of cylinders) and arrayed so that their long axes are orthogonal to the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      Application of a magnetic field to the ferrofluid composition creates interactions between the colloidal ferromagnetic particles and the non-magnetic substantive particles.
      <br/>
      These interactions result in mutual stabilization in a non-random structural pattern (with chain formation where the appropriate dimension of a layer of the composition so permits) due to attractive interactions between particles and repulsive interaction between chains �(see Skjeltorp, One- and Two-Dimensional Crystallization of Magnetic Holes, Physical Review Letters, 51(25) 2306-2309, (Dec. 19, 1983)�.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      The concentration of substantive particles in the composition should be chosen according to the desired spacing between those particles in the ordered array and other factors.
      <br/>
      With spherical particles of about 2 micrometers diameter, a concentration in a monolayer of about 10 particles per square centimeter may be suitable.
      <br/>
      A qualitative concentration in the range 0.5-60%, by weight of the composition may also be suitable (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,366,140, the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference, particularly column 2, lines 24-28 which describes average densities of about 600-6,000,000 microbeads/cm2, such as 160,000-6,000,000 beads/cm2).
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      Desirable concentrations of substantive particles depend upon a number of factors that can be determined by those person skilled in the art through routine experimentation and/or mathematical calculations. U.S. Pat. No. 4,846,988 (Skjeltorp) notes that the concentration of magnetic holes in ferrofluids polarized with a magnetic field, determines the distance between them.

      Shiozawa et. al. 1 st International Conference on Adhesive Joining Technology in Electronics Manufacturing, Berlin (November 1994) indicates that contact resistance in traditional anisotropically conductive adhesives decreases as particle count (per unit area) increases.
      <br/>
      An increasing number of conductive particles increases the current carrying capacity.
      <br/>
      The current carrying capabilities are not only concentration dependent but also particle type dependent �(see Lyons and Dahringer in Handbook of Adhesives Technology, Pizzi and Mittal, eds., Marcel Dekker Inc., p.578, (1994)�.
    </p>
    <p num="132">Thus, the actual concentration of conductive particles should depend on the particle type, density, diameter, electrical pattern, minimum required contact resistance measurements, the spacing between opposing and adjacent conductors, the surface area of the conductors and the like.</p>
    <p num="133">
      Li and Morris, 1 st International Conference on Adhesive Joining Technology in Electronics Manufacturing, Berlin) (November 1994) describes computer programs which calculate the minimum pad size for different loading densities and the minimum pad space for different particle sizes of conductive particles in conductive adhesives.
      <br/>
      In ordering the array of particles, a magnetic field may be applied by a permanent magnet or by electromagnetic means.
      <br/>
      The magnetic field is described to be in the range of 10 mT to 1000 mT, such as 10 mT to 100 mT, applied for a time in the range 0.1 to 10 minutes, such as 0.5 to 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      The magnetization saturation of the ferrofluid composition should influence the selection of the magnetic field strength.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      Films or coatings according to the present invention containing electrically-conductive particles are intended for use in electrical interconnection of active and/or passive electronic components, for example chip-on-board, chip-on-flex, chip-on-glass and board/flex and flex/glass.
      <br/>
      The invention is particularly well suited for interconnection of fine-pitch sets of conductors and for flip-chip technology.

    <p num="135">
      The present invention further provides a product in the form of the tack layer following removal of the particles therefrom.
      <br/>
      The tack layer, free of particles, may inherently produce a result of the separation of an adhesive film with the particles adhering thereto away from the layer of cured curable composition or cured curable ferrofluid composition in the method of C or G above, respectively.
      <br/>
      The so-formed product includes a layer of cured composition having apertures or recesses therein corresponding to the locations of particles, such as arrayed particles.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      The invention also provides an adhesive film having recesses in the adhesive surface layer thereof, produced as a result of removal of particles formerly adhered thereto in the method of C or G above.
      <br/>
      The removal of particles from the adhesive film should be effected by applying to the particles a second adhesive film having an adhesiveness with respect to the particles greater than that of the first adhesive film.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the recesses may be created in the second adhesive film by removal of the particles therefrom by applying a third adhesive film having even stronger adhesiveness with respect to the particles than the second adhesive.
      <br/>
      This procedure may be repeated in a mastering operation from one adhesive film to another with greater adhesiveness.
      <br/>
      The adhesive film may be in the form of a pressure sensitive adhesive tape.
    </p>
    <p num="137">The array of craters in the first (or subsequent) adhesive film may be of higher quality than that in the cured tack layer because of possible roughness in the tack layer after removal of uncured curable composition.</p>
    <p num="138">The particle array on the first adhesive film may also be used as a master to create a pattern by stamping, or the like, into a substrate capable of producing a smooth surface and retaining the shapes of the recesses created by the particles.</p>
    <p num="139">
      The recesses or "craters" may be circular in outline, or may have non-circular shapes, such as squares or hexagons, depending upon the cross-section of the particles.
      <br/>
      The craters may have a parabolic or flat base, depending upon the shape of the particles.
    </p>
    <p num="140">The crater arrays may be overcoated with a thin layer of moldable material, such as metal, for example to make a reflector array of parabolic mirrors, or glass, for example to make waveguides with geodesic optical elements incorporated thereon.</p>
    <p num="141">
      The invention also provides a film having apertures therein corresponding to the locations of particles, such as in an arrayed pattern, produced by removing particles from a film produced by the method of C, D, G or H above.
      <br/>
      The particles may, for example, be removed from the film by treatment with a solvent which dissolves the particles but not the film, e.g. THF or acetone for dissolving polystyrene spherical particles.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      The cratered array may also be prepared from other backfill materials including ceramics or metallics, and highly resistant polymers.
      <br/>
      Particles may be removed by dissolution, pyrolysis and the like to leave voids in an arrayed configuration in the film, which may be useful for example in membrane applications, mastergrid applications for displays or display elements, confining other species such as liquid crystals, photochromic materials, dyes, photosensitive or emissive materials, or for vibrating plate orifice devices for aerosol production �Berglund, R. N., Environmental Science and Technology, 7, 2, 147. (1973)�.

    <p num="143">
      The invention additionally provides a method of making an assembly of two components which includes forming a monolayer of particles in a cured layer of curable composition according to the method of A or E, removing the uncured curable composition, bringing the second component into contact with the particles, and applying a fluid adhesive material into the space between the components and optionally over the assembly.
      <br/>
      The method is particularly suitable for forming a "globbed" assembly of an electronic device onto a substrate such as a board.
      <br/>
      The cured tack layer with the particles arrayed therein is created on the substrate and the device is assembled onto the particle array.
      <br/>
      It may optionally be held in position by a "chipbonder" adhesive in small quantities, or the particles themselves may have adhesive properties, such as is described in the WO '820 publication.
      <br/>
      The assembly may then be globbed and underfilled simultaneously by applying adhesive over the device and into the space between the two components including the interstitial space between the particles.
      <br/>
      This method maximizes electrical contact and environmental protection for the particles.

      This particle-containing ferroadhesive composition was applied to a microscope slide and confined by placing a glass cover slip on top of the liquid formulation.
      <br/>
      The liquid film was squeezed gently with even pressure to give a uniform film which was less than two particle diameters in thickness.
      <br/>
      The sample was poled in a Halbach magnetic cylinder with a uniform magnetic field of 0.6 T for approximately 30 seconds at room temperature (approx. 26 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The field direction was perpendicular to the substrate plane.
      <br/>
      The sample was removed from the poling field and irradiated with UV light from the microscope slide side for 0.2 of a second.
      <br/>
      The glass cover slip was then prized off with a blade and the upper portion of the sample was seen to be in a substantially uncured liquid form.
      <br/>
      Inspection under the microscope however revealed that an ordered particle array was still intact following the delamination of the top cover slip, and the gold particles were completely uncovered by material.
      <br/>
      There was nevertheless some free liquid material still surrounding the particles.
      <br/>
      The free liquid material was washed from the sample with a jet of acetone.
      <br/>
      Washings were colored with ferrofluid.
      <br/>
      The sample was re-examined under the microscope to reveal an intact array of bright gold particles on a dry surface.
      <br/>
      No trace of liquid material was observed in the particle interstitial spaces.
      <br/>
      Electron microscopy revealed that a 23.6 micrometers of a 25 micrometer diameter particle was standing proud on a cured layer of the ferroadhesive composition as shown in FIG. 1 i.e. the cured layer had a thickness of 1.4 micrometers which is 5.6% of the diameter of the particles.
      <br/>
      This distance could be controlled by adjusting parameters relating to the absorption of the ferrofluid composition, the confining structure and the illumination conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      The array of ordered particles standing proud on the surface was backfilled with film-forming adhesive of the composition tabulated above i.e. of identical composition to that from which the ferroadhesive was derived except that it contained no magnetite nor ingredients necessary to disperse same.
      <br/>
      The backfilling material filled the interstitial spaces between the particles.
      <br/>
      This backfilled system was confined by a cover slip and again irradiated from the slide side, now for ten seconds, to invoke an A-stage cure as described in the second parent application, Example 7.
      <br/>
      The A-staged film was peeled free from confining cover slip and substrate sequentially and used in electrical and mechanical tests.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      Mechanical testing involved bonding a 36 mm2 silicon die onto an FR4 substrate with the above-mentioned film.
      <br/>
      The bonding conditions (B-stage cure) for both the backfill and the tack layer were: 90 seconds, 100N, and approximately 180 (degree)  C. in the bondline.
      <br/>
      The sample was left for one hour at room temperature before die shear testing.
      <br/>
      Die shear strengths averaging 13 mPa were recorded.
      <br/>
      Typical values obtained in identical tests for pure ferroadhesives were around 4 mPa.

    <p num="155">
      Electrical testing of the sample prepared according to the invention showed Z-axis contact resistance of 350 mOhms.

    <p num="156">Example 2</p>
    <p num="157">
      An identical experiment to that described in Example 1 was conducted up to the point where the ordered array was washed and left adhering to a cured layer of the ferroadhesive composition.
      <br/>
      Next a commercially available pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) tape (Sellotape--registered trade mark) was used to transfer the ordered array of particles from the cured ferroadhesive layer directly on to the PSA while retaining order as shown by electron microscopy and illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      In this way the particles were set free from the cured ferroadhesive layer or tack layer.
      <br/>
      The top of the spheres shown in FIG. 2 corresponds to the bottom, or tacked portion, of the spheres shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Depending on the applied pressure the particles may be transferred into the PSA to different depths.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows a 25 micrometer sphere embedded to a distance of 4 micrometers in the PSA.
      <br/>
      The particles supported on the PSA were backfilled and part cured (A-stage) in the same way and to the same effect as described in the previous example.
      <br/>
      The liner on the PSA tape was removed for test purposes, but otherwise supported the films and facilitated handling.
      <br/>
      The transfer operation left behind an array of craters in the ferroadhesive layer or tack layer remaining on the substrate.
      <br/>
      This ferroadhesive layer with the array of craters therein could be used for other purposes.
    </p>
    <p num="158">Example 3</p>
    <p num="159">
      Since the function of the ferroadhesive composition is to order and tack particles, it is not necessary that this material be formulated to impart dual stage cures or any specific strength characteristics.
      <br/>
      However it is advantageous if the ferroadhesive adheres better to the substrate than to the backfilled matrix of film-forming material.
      <br/>
      To this end acrylic acid was admixed with the commercially available ferrofluid APG 511A (Ferrofluidics Inc., NH, USA) in a 1:1 mix together with some 10% of photoinitiator IC 1700 (Ciba-Geigy, UK) (cf. WO 95/20820 Example 18-19).
      <br/>
      This produced a polymerizable fluid with a magnetic saturation of almost 90 G and with a viscosity considerably less than 40 mPa * s at room temperature (APG 511A alone has a room temperature viscosity of 40 mPa * s, whereas acrylic acid is of lower viscosity) which was extremely responsive to a magnetic field and capable of ordering included magnetic holes (i.e. particles) in one to three seconds at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Various other ratios of acrylic acid and APG511A were used to get greater magnetic strength or greater polymerization.
      <br/>
      Ordered arrays were established by the means described in Example 1 (photocure for 0.2 seconds).
      <br/>
      The ordered-particles were washed on the cured polyacrylic acid layer with acetone and the tack layer remained intact.

    <p num="160">
      The skeletal array of particles was backfilled with the non-ferroadhesive equivalent of the curable composition tabulated in Example 1.
      <br/>
      The backfilled adhesive was cured for ten seconds as previously described (A-stage) and stripped free from the cured polyacrylic acid film layer which remained tenaciously adhered to the substrate due to its rich polar structure.
      <br/>
      The free standing test film was completely transparent and uncoloured by ferrofluid and comprised an array of bright gold spheres.
      <br/>
      This was subjected to mechanical and electrical testing according to the methods already described.
      <br/>
      Mechanical testing showed die shear strengths of 10 mPa and electrical testing showed a Z axis contact resistance of some 500 mOhms.
      <br/>
      The backfilled matrix without particles was an electrical insulator.

      A commercial double-sided PSA tape (Sellotape--registered trade mark) was used to prepare a test substrate.

      One side was adhered to a glass microscope slide and the other side which faced upwards was stripped of its siliconized backing film.
      <br/>
      A commercially available (non-polymerizable) ferrofluid (APG 511A from Ferrofluidics Inc, NH, USA) containing 25 micrometer Au-coated uniform plastic spheres at approximately 10% w/w was prepared and applied on top of the PSA tape.
      <br/>
      A siliconized release paper was gently placed on top of the ferrofluid droplet taking care not to press so much that particles became stuck to the PSA before ordering.
      <br/>
      This was achieved by placing a glass cover slip on top of the siliconized paper to function as a low mass weight which would exert pressure over a given area.
      <br/>
      The sample was poled in a uniform magnetic field as described in the second parent application.
      <br/>
      After poling for one to three seconds the sample was removed and pressure was uniformly applied to the assembly to drive the particles onto the PSA surface.
      <br/>
      The siliconized paper was removed and the sample was washed free of ferrofluid with a brief acetone wash.

      Five milliliters of the above mentioned heptane-based material was added to 5 ml of butane diol dimethacrylate and a further 2 ml of a secondary surfactant was added which was an acid form of an aromatic phosphate ester sold under the Trade Mark GAFAC RE610 by GAF (Great Britain) Limited and now available as RHODAFAC RE610=GAFAC RE610 from Rhone Poulenc Chimie, France.

      The saturation magnetization curve was steep and typical of superparamagnetic systems in that it exhibited no hysteresis.

    <p num="171">
      (a) In order to demonstrate the in situ ordering of magnetic holes in a ferrofluid coating, the following experiment was conducted.
      <br/>
      A DEK 245 high performance multipurpose screen printer was modified in such a way that a substantially uniform magnetic field could be applied to a specific area of an overlying substrate, such that the direction of the magnetic field was orthogonal to the substrate and the so-called `worktable` of the printer (DEK Printing Machines LTD, Dorset, England).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 6(a) and 6(b) the conventional worktable of the DEK 245 was replaced with a custom-built worktable which comprised a polished aluminum surface plate (320 mm * 240 mm) (1) with a central milled depression (2) sufficient to accommodate a standard glass microscope slide (approximately 76 mm * 25 mm) (3).
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      The polished plate was mounted over an array of flat permanent magnets arranged so that a stripe of magnetic material (4) some 170 mm long by 50 mm wide lay directly beneath the milled depression in the plate, the said depression being located approximately 70 mm from the squeegee (5) end of the stripe so that a magnetic field was developed in advance of the substrate (slide 3) with respect to the direction of print, the direction of print being that which moves squeegee blade (5) from left of FIG. 6(a) (A end) to the right of the FIG. 6(b)(B end).
      <br/>
      The magnetic stripe was constructed from a series of flat ferrite magnets each 40 mm * 25 mm * 8 mm (length * width * depth).
      <br/>
      These were poled across their thickness and collectively delivered approximately 400 Oe field strength, measured directly on the surface of the overlying polished plate.
      <br/>
      Each magnet had its flat face parallel to the face of polished worktable top plate (1) and was arranged so that the long dimension of each magnet was parallel to the long axis of the top plate.
      <br/>
      Flanking the central magnetic stripe on either side, were two similar stripes poled in the opposite direction to the central stripe.
      <br/>
      All three stripes were bonded together to complete a magnetic circuit with vertical flux lines rising up through the substrate coincident with the milled depression (2) in the top plate (1).
    </p>
    <p num="173">In comparative experiments where no magnetic field was required, the same polished top plate was used, but the array of underlying magnets was temporarily removed.</p>
    <p num="174">
      A particle-filled ferrofluid formulation was prepared based on a commercially available ferrofluid having a 1500 mPa * s (1.5 Nm-2 s) viscosity (APG 057 available from Ferrofluids, Inc, NH, USA) and 10 weight percent of transparent 11 micrometer cross-linked polystyrene spheres (Sekisui Fine Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan).
      <br/>
      The spheres were thoroughly dispersed in the formulation by vigorous mixing.
      <br/>
      The formulation was applied to the magnetic worktable (1) in a 20 mm stripe positioned about 20 mm in advance of the milled depression (2) which now contained a standard laboratory microscope slide (3).
      <br/>
      The worktable was raised to a position that would enable the printing of a thin coating of ferrofluid.
      <br/>
      The worktable position, printing speed, printing pressure, and squeegee type were adjusted in independent experiments to optimize coating for the particular formulation under consideration.
      <br/>
      The motorized squeegee blade pulled the formulation across the length of the microscope slide.
      <br/>
      During this coating action the filled fluid experienced a magnetic field.
      <br/>
      After the printing cycle the squeegee blade lifted free from the worktable surface and reverted to its original position in readiness for another operation.
    </p>
    <p num="175">
      The coated substrate (3) was examined optically using a microscope connected to an optical image analyzer.
      <br/>
      The latter equipment is capable of processing the image and assessing the quality of the field-induced ordering of particles in the ferrofluid.
      <br/>
      The particles order in the ferrofluid coating because they act as magnetic holes in the fluid matrix.
      <br/>
      The phenomenon of magnetic holes has been described by Skjeltorp (see for example "One and Two Dimensional Crystallization of Magnetic Holes" in Physical Review Letter, 51(25), 2306, 1983) in fluid films which are confined in a cavity formed by two rigid substrates.
      <br/>
      In this case, the coating was unconfined.
    </p>
    <p num="176">Image analysis of the coated substrate indicated that a substantially uniform film with discrete particles dispersed therein resulted as illustrated in FIG. 7.</p>
    <p num="177">
      A comparative experiment was conducted using the above mentioned formulation and methodology except that the array of magnets was removed from the underside of the worktable.
      <br/>
      The results of this experiment are indicated in FIG. 8 and clearly show that the particles are not uniformly dispersed nor isolated as discrete particle entities.
    </p>

      The boards were taped in place on an ACCU-LAB (tm)  draw down coater (Industry-Tech., Oldsmar, Fla.) and the formulation was drawn down with Meyer rod to give a wet thickness of approximately 40 micrometers.
      <br/>
      The coated substrate was placed into a Halbach magnetic cylinder with the uniform field of 0.6 Tesla disposed normally to the sample plane.

      Poling was conducted when the film was still wet and solvent evaporation proceeded while the sample remained in the magnetic field until a tacky film was obtained.

      Adhesives derived from coatings or films can be made by B-staging a pre-cast material.
      <br/>
      In such cases, the primary solidification, or A-stage, may result from solvent evaporation and/or partially induced thermal cure.
      <br/>
      The A-stage, which has the function of locking conductor particle arrays in place, may equally be performed by chemical reactions which cause partial gelling at temperatures which are nevertheless well below the thermal threshold temperature required to trigger latent polymerization catalysts used to activate subsequent B-stages, e.g. &lt;120 (degree)  C. in the case of dicyandiamide (DICY).

      An example of a system that operates at room temperature involves reaction between multi-functional isocyanates and polyols to yield a polyurethane.
      <br/>
      The ferrofluid content of such a formulation may be derived from a ferrofluid polyol, a ferrofluid isocyanate or from some other monomeric system which does not enter into polyurethane formation but is present to provide subsequent heat cure, eg, ferrofluid epoxy or acrylic monomers.
      <br/>
      The formulation below has been used to order conductive particles and lock them in place by chemical reactions (polyurethane formation) at room temperature which were unassisted by light:

      An alternative approach to locking particles in ordered arrays in ferrofluid adhesives involves photochemistry.
      <br/>
      Thus the A-stage can be a photoinduced cationic or radical cure.
      <br/>
      Formulations which respond in this way may only partially cure with light, or may comprise two different types of reacting system which act independently (in the same or in different monomers).
      <br/>
      In the former cases a mixed cycloaliphatic and non-cycloaliphatic system may be partially cured with photocationic initiators and subsequently thermally cured in a B-stage process.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, a mixed acrylic-epoxy system may be designed and a photoinduced radical cure used to act on the acrylic functionalities to lock ordered conductor arrays in place.

      In order to produce high quality anisotropically conductive adhesives or films (ACAs or ACFs respectively) it was necessary to design specialized formulations and specialized equipment.
      <br/>
      The film making equipment is illustrated in FIG. 5. 11(a), and 11(b) and provides films up to approximately 20 square centimeters in area, although the test pieces routinely used were approximately 7.5 square centimeters in area.
      <br/>
      This example describes in detail the apparatus used to produce films and the processing steps involved.
    </p>
    <p num="196">
      As shown in FIG. 11(a), carriage 10 which is a flat platform constructed from polished non magnetic steel is used to hold the sample.
      <br/>
      The carriage comprises a vacuum chuck to hold a substrate in place as well as a cartridge heater capable of raising the platform temperature to approximately 100 (degree)  C., and a thermocouple for temperature sensing.
      <br/>
      The carriage is mounted on a Tufnal base to prevent any thermal transfer to the substructure on which it rests.
      <br/>
      The carriage rides on single track 11, again constructed from non magnetic material.
      <br/>
      The arrangement is such that the mounted carriage assembly can be moved to specific positions from the leftmost side of the apparatus to the right.
      <br/>
      On so doing it can be passed into the central plane of large magnetic (Halbach) cylinder 17.
      <br/>
      When processing is finished, the carriage can be retracted and moved from the right of the apparatus to the left.

      The ferrofluid adhesive formulation containing a plurality of conductors is applied to a release coated substrate mounted on top of carriage 10.
      <br/>
      The said substrate is flat and may be reflective.
      <br/>
      A similarly treated substrate is placed over the top of the ferrofluid adhesive film.
      <br/>
      This substrate is UV transmissive
    </p>
    <p num="198">
      When the ferrofluid adhesive composition comprising a plurality of conductors is confined by the two substrates the disposition of the conductive particles is initially random in three dimensions.
      <br/>
      The confined fluid is brought and locked into position in the next step of the film making process.
      <br/>
      If initial film assembly is considered step 1 of the process, the second step may be described as `wet film thickness determination`. In this second step, the assembled film is compressed by apparatus identified by numerals 12-14 in FIG. 11(a).
      <br/>
      The object of this compression stage is to produce a homogeneous fluid film occupying the entire area of the confining top substrate with excessive liquid being squeezed out around the entire periphery of the top substrate.
      <br/>
      Not only does the compression achieve a substantially uniform fluid film, but pressure is applied which produces a fluid layer between the substrates such that the liquid layer is less than two conductive particle diameters in thickness.
      <br/>
      This situation is referred to as a monolayer of conductive particles.
      <br/>
      The fluid film is however thicker than a particle diameter so that the individual particles are free to move in the XY plane of the sample.
    </p>
    <p num="199">
      The hardware used in this second stage comprises an air driven cylinder 12 capable of delivering a continuously variable pressure up to 20 Kgs per square centimeter, a pressure measuring device 13 and a specially designed cube 14 which eventually applies pressure to the film assembly.
      <br/>
      Cube 14 is open on one of its vertical faces to allow optical access for a UV beam.
      <br/>
      At a position corresponding approximately to the cube diagonal a high quality mirror 15, tuned to optimize UV reflection, is mounted at an angle of 45 degrees or less to deflect light downwards towards the underlying sample.
      <br/>
      The bottom face of the cube, i.e., that which is parallel to the sample plane, is a high quality fused silica optical flat 1 centimeter in thickness and approximately 5 centimeters on each side.
      <br/>
      This component is flat to  LAMBDA /4 or better over 25 square millimeters measured at the green Ar ion laser line.
      <br/>
      The optical window in the cube base created by this component after mounting onto the cube assembly is 3 centimeters * 3 centimeters.
      <br/>
      The optical flat sits proud from the base of the cube framework and hence applies pressure across an area up to 5 centimeters * 5 centimeters.
      <br/>
      The entire assembly attached to the cylinder 12 can be made to appear weightless by differential pressure control to the cylinder regulated through precision controls in box 18.
      <br/>
      These controls also enable extremely gentle touch down of the assembly onto the sample below.
      <br/>
      Control box 18 further comprises heater control and feedback for the carriage cartridge heater.
      <br/>
      The remaining sides of the cube framework are polished metal optionally fitted with heat sinks on their outer surfaces.
      <br/>
      A heat sink may also be bonded to the rear side of the mirror within the cube to remove any heat generated by the lamp.
    </p>
    <p num="200">
      To generate a wet film having a thickness of approximately one conductive particle diameter, the pressure controls are regulated to compress the film assembly.
      <br/>
      This requires pressures typically in the order of a few Kgs per square centimeter.
      <br/>
      The pressure is then removed and the film remains essentially at the compressed thickness.
      <br/>
      The carriage 10 bearing the compressed film is then inspected in step 3.
      <br/>
      Inspection is conducted with reflective mode microscope 16 usually operating at 200 *  magnification.
      <br/>
      The length of the film can be scanned.
      <br/>
      The image is relayed to a monitor by a video camera attached to the trinocular head of the microscope.
      <br/>
      When the operator is satisfied that the film is a monolayer with respect to thickness, the assembly can be sent to the next process step.
      <br/>
      If the film is not a monolayer, it may be sent back a step and recompressed under different conditions until a satisfactory result is observed.
      <br/>
      Once in monolayer configuration, the film is advanced into the poling gate 17 which comprises a large Halbach magnetic cylinder with a circular aperture of approximately 55 millimeters and a length of approximately 140 millimeters.
      <br/>
      This permanent magnet has been designed and constructed to deliver a substantially uniform magnetic field over the vast majority of its length.
      <br/>
      The Halbach cylinder delivers a field of 0.6 T, the orientation of which may be controlled by rotating it in its cup shaped housing.
      <br/>
      The strength of the magnetic field was selected to substantially saturate the ferrofluid compositions employed.
      <br/>
      To achieve a uniform dispersion of conductive particles such as that depicted in FIG. 7, the field will be applied normal to the sample.
      <br/>
      It has however been found helpful to achieve very high degrees of order to first pole the sample with the field direction parallel to the sample then subsequently redirect the field to a position normal to the sample.
      <br/>
      The period required for poling depends on a number of parameters such as the composition of the fluid with regard to magnetizable material, magnetization saturation of the fluid at the specific field applied, the viscosity of the formulation, the temperature of the sample, etc.
      <br/>
      The sample temperature can be regulated by heating the mounting platform 10.
    </p>
    <p num="201">
      After the fourth step of poling, the sample is retracted from the magnet and re-inspected to check for conductor particle ordering.
      <br/>
      If ordering is not satisfactory, the sample may be re-poled.
      <br/>
      At this fifth stage or at the third inspection stage, the video camera output may be connected to an optical image analyzer which provides quality control of the ordering process.
      <br/>
      The ordered fluid film is next retracted in step six back to the compression position.
      <br/>
      The ordered sample may be photocured at this point with or without pressure applied to the liquid film.
      <br/>
      In this process the sample is illuminated with UV light, item 19 in FIG. 11(a), to induce photocure and lock the arrayed conductors in place.
      <br/>
      An Oriel 1 kW XeHg arc lamp (LOT ORIEL, Leatherhead, Surrey, UK) with a 50 millimeter beam diameter and fitted with a dichroic mirror and electronic shutter was built into the film making fixture and used to partially cure, or A-stage, the ACFs.
      <br/>
      Following UV irradiation, the pressure, if applied, was released from the assembly and the cured film was carefully released from the substrates.
      <br/>
      The central section of the thus produced ACF, which was approximately 7.5 square centimeters in area, was used for physical testing.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      Following cleaning or replacement of substrates, the operation could be repeated.
      <br/>
      The apparatus was designed to accommodate different types and sizes of conductor particles and different viscosity formulations.
      <br/>
      Process parameters could thus be obtained for continuous film making equipment.

      The abovementioned formulations may be classified into two general classes, viz., those in which the conventional ferrofluids are not in themselves polymerisable, but are formulated with various levels and types of monomer(s) which are polymerisable (Type I), and those derived from 100% polymerisable ferrofluid carriers (Type II).
      <br/>
      In each case the formulations contained various levels of initiator systems, such as a photoinitiator (IC 1700).
      <br/>
      The formulations may further contain specialized adhesion promoters for specific substrates, for example, KR-55 is an adhesion promoter for polyester available from Kennrich Petrochemicals, Inc., NJ which is compatible with ferrocolloids of either Type I or II.

    <p num="232">
      In a typical procedure, a formulation containing approximately 10% w/w of 18 micron Au coated crosslinked polystyrene spheres (Sekisui KK, Japan) was applied to a polyester film.
      <br/>
      The liquid sample was laminated with a second polyester film or a thin glass cover slip.
      <br/>
      In the case where polyester films formed both sides of the laminate, rigid substrates, such microscope slides, were applied above and below the polyester films to keep the whole assembly flat and convenient to handle.
      <br/>
      The samples were poled in a 0.6 T uniform magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet configured in a Halbach cylinder arrangement.
      <br/>
      The direction of the field was perpendicular to the plane of the samples.
      <br/>
      Poling time was in the order of a few seconds.
      <br/>
      Following field poling the samples were irradiated from one specific side, for example, the underside, for approximately 0.3 seconds or less.
      <br/>
      The laminate was subsequently split apart by peeling the top polyester film off, to reveal a material which was only partially cured.
      <br/>
      The sample was washed or `developed` with an organic solvent, to reveal an array of bright golden spheres adhered to the lower substrate by a thin carpet of cured ferroadhesive which uniformly covered the area which the lamp exposed.
      <br/>
      The organic solvent was chosen so as not to damage the thin cured layer of ferroadhesive.
      <br/>
      The washings removed all uncured ferroadhesive Electron microscopic examination of the final cured layer revealed that the tacked spheres were held in place by a layer of cured Ferroadhesive approximately 1.5 microns in thickness.
    </p>
    <p num="233">
      Experiments were also conducted with particles of different sizes, types as well as with different concentrations of particles.
      <br/>
      Thus for example, 7 micron Au coated crosslinked polystyrene spheres at 15% w/w were locked in arrays on the surface of a thin cured ferroadhesive.
      <br/>
      Non-conductive 25 micron uncoated polystyrene spheres were similarly adhered to the surfaces as were 15 micron regular hexagonal zeolite crystals, etc.
      <br/>
      Solder particles were also locked onto surfaces using the abovementioned methods.

    <p num="234">Example 14</p>
    <p num="235">
      Tacked array samples were prepared according to the general descriptions in Example 13 with the lower flexible substrate having release properties.
      <br/>
      Suitable substrates included oriented polypropylene (OPP) films siliconised OPP and polyester available from Sterling Coated Materials Ltd, Cheshire, UK.
      <br/>
      Care had to be exercised in the development of tacked array samples which adhered on substrates with release properties to avoid debonding the tacked array prematurely.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless robust samples could be prepared by optimising exposure conditions particularly with the OPP substrates.
      <br/>
      Siliconised polyester substrates have the advantage of greater dimensional stability at elevated temperature relative to OPP which can be important in downstream drying operations aimed at solvent removal from adhesive compositions cast atop the tacked array of particles.
    </p>
    <p num="236">Example 15</p>
    <p num="237">
      Tacked array samples prepared on release conferring flexible substrates were backfilled with different types of adhesive compositions to produce final transfer tape embodiments.
      <br/>
      In these embodiments the entire adhesive film, complete with particle arrays, may be transferred from their supporting substrates to substrates such as those comprising the device to be assembled, for example.
      <br/>
      In all cases the adhesive transfer tape had a built in B-stage capability; it thus contained a latent thermal hardener.
      <br/>
      The latter was essential to effect subsequent cure in end use.
    </p>
    <p num="238">
      In order to form a tape capable of transfer in the first instance, adhesives were formulated to produce an initial solid product form.
      <br/>
      This so-called A-staged film, was either completely uncured but derived from solid film forming resin mixtures after evaporation from a casting solvent, or, was initially partially cured, for example by photochemistry, to a solid like product form.
      <br/>
      The former approach has the advantage of presenting a film which can be completely cured by the end user, while the latter approach is completely solventless.

      Typical adhesive formulations suitable for backfilling tacked array samples from each type of sample are described below:

      To this formulation a latent epoxy curing agent could be added.
      <br/>
      The amount of latent curatives is to be added depends on curative type as well as the final cure profile required in the B-stage and are readily adjusted by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Optimization of the B-stage cure was effected using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis, hot stage optical microscopy, and Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA) of final cured coatings.
      <br/>
      The casting formulations were typically 50% solids.
      <br/>
      Films were prepared at approximately 40 micron dry film thickness.
      <br/>
      Standard draw down techniques and Meyer rod applicator bars (Industry Tech Inc.
      <br/>
      USA) were used to apply the films to tacked array substrates which were taped on glass sheets during the backfilling operation.
      <br/>
      Toluene and or MEK were used as casting solvent systems.

      The films were dried in a fan assisted laboratory oven.

      In the abovementioned example a specific DICY type hardener (Casamid 783) is described.
      <br/>
      This is not meant to limit the example.
      <br/>
      Other latent hardeners were also used.
    </p>
    <p num="245">
      In this case no solvent was used and films of comparable thickness to the aforementioned could be prepared by draw down.
      <br/>
      In some cases it was found helpful to laminate over the liquid film before curing with some flexible release coated material.
      <br/>
      Exposures of approximately 5 seconds or less at about 100 mW/cm2 effected A-stage cure.
      <br/>
      Subsequent mechanical testing of lap shear joints prepared by placing a patch of thus cured (A-staged) backfiller itself (i.e., independent from a tacked array sample) between two metal lapshear specimens then heat curing the assembly at temperatures in excess of 150C for 10 minutes indicated that much additional curing occurred and strong bonds resulted.
    </p>
    <p num="246">Example 16</p>
    <p num="247">
      Hot melt adhesive films (reactive types available from Sika Werke GmbH, Liepzig, Germany) and passive types available from Samatech-Xiro Ltd., CH-3185, Schmitten, Switzerland) were individually placed atop a tacked array sample as described in Examples 13 and/or 14.
      <br/>
      The tacked array--Adhesive film assembly was placed between the rollers of a desktop office laminating machine, of the type used to make Membership or Visitor card badges (Ibico ML4).
      <br/>
      The machine heated the assembly and applied pressure to it.
      <br/>
      After passage through the machine, the ordered array of spheres had completely transferred into the hot melt film which could be peeled away.
      <br/>
      The spheres could be further depressed into the hot melt film if necessary by further laminating the film between two release coated substrates.
      <br/>
      In these experiments, the relative adhesion between the tacked layer to its initial substrate, e.g., polyester as in Example 13, and the adhesive film which was applied atop, was controlled with various treatments.
      <br/>
      Thus polyester adhesion promoters in the initial ferroadhesive formulation (cf, Example 13) encouraged the tack layer to remain on the initial substrate after the transfer operation into the hot melt film.
      <br/>
      Adhesion of the tack layer to the hot melt film was discouraged by incorporating a release agent in the developing solvent used to wash away excess ferroadhesive (cf Example 13).
      <br/>
      Suitable release agents included the RA10 series and RA-95H available from Mayzo Inc., Georgia, USA, and Silwet.RTM. (ex. Witco).
      <br/>
      Alternatively one or more release agents were sprayed atop the tacked array before laminating with a hot melt film.
      <br/>
      In some cases ferroadhesive compatible release agents were included in the initial formulation prepared for the process.
      <br/>
      Examples of ferroadhesives compatible release agents included RAD 2200 available from Tego Chemie Service GmbH, Essen, Germany, which was compatible with diacrylate (Type II) ferrofluids.
    </p>
    <p num="248">
      In cases where cured ferroadhesive from the tack layer had transferred to the adhesive film as a result of lamination and the ferroadhesive layer was not required in the final product, the ferroadhesive layer could be removed easily from the final adhesive film by rubbing the sample with a moist tissue.
      <br/>
      With ferroadhesives derived from acrylic acid, moistening with aqueous solutions was particularly effective.
      <br/>
      In cases employing predominantly diacrylate based ferroadhesives, moistening with acetone solutions was particularly effective.
      <br/>
      Cleaning solvents were chosen on the basis of their non, or very limited, reaction with the surface layer of the adhesive matrix forming material.
      <br/>
      In either case, the fact that the ferroadhesive film was so thin (approximately 1.5 microns) meant that it was easily and quickly removed.
      <br/>
      Removal of the colour associated with said film gave a simple method for gauging when the cleaning process was complete.
      <br/>
      This process further enhanced the optical clarity of the resulting ACF.
    </p>
    <p num="249">
      The use of non reactive hot melt films provided a means of producing thermoplastic transfer adhesives.
      <br/>
      The films may also be used as anisotropically conductive test films when their bonding capability is not activated.
      <br/>
      The latter also is true of fully cured backfill matrices, or backfilled UV curing matrices which purposely do not have a B-stage capability.
    </p>
    <p num="250">Example 17</p>
    <p num="251">
      Formulations similar to those described in Example 15 were used to form B-stageable transfer tape or films on release coated flexible substrates without incorporating any particles therein.
      <br/>
      Particle arrays from tack layer samples were then transferred to these tapes via lamination as in Example 16.
      <br/>
      The tackiness of the films was adjusted to facilitate array transfer by including or adjusting epoxy diluent monomer (Heloxy 505) concentrations, and/or through the use of conventional tacifiers known to those skilled in the art (for example, Unitac types available from Union Camp, Vistanex available from Exxon, Vylons available from Toyobo).
      <br/>
      Thus the backfilling matrix could be applied to the particle array chassis by either backfilling with a wet formulation (Example 15), or, with a dry or preapplied film, in this case derived from essentially the same formulations modified for tack.
    </p>
    <p num="252">
      The dry lamination option in advantageous in that already formed commercially available B-stageable transfer tapes may be used as a matrix.
      <br/>
      It further permits a greater level of control of inventory management in the production of ACF type products which may require user defined specific particle types, concentrations, sizes, matrix types, and product formats.
      <br/>
      The process of transferring particle arrays into preformed films permits separation of the two key processes in the formation of ordered ACFs: (1) the process of forming a tacked array which involves ferroadhesive coating, temporary laminating, field aligning, UV exposure, delaminating and solvent developing, and (2) the backfilling operation which entails application and A-stage formation of the adhesive matrix to produce a solid form transfer tape.
      <br/>
      Where these processes are integrated, the rate determining step of the process is the field aligning step, which by default, would dictate the coating speed of wet backfilling operations.
      <br/>
      In certain cases it may be desirable to control the backfilling rate independently from the formation of the tacked array.
    </p>
    <p num="253">Example 18</p>
    <p num="254">
      Tacked array samples were prepared on polyester substrates as described in Example 13.
      <br/>
      These were used in lamination experiments using the equipment and methods described in Example 16.
      <br/>
      Polyethylene coated paper, however, was used as a second substrate.
      <br/>
      A tacked array sample was placed, array side down, atop a polyethylene coated paper (Sterling Coated Materials Ltd, Cheshire, UK), with the polyethylene side facing towards the array of gold spheres.
      <br/>
      The thus configured substrates was laminated as in Example 13 and the polyester substrate bearing the original array of spheres peeled away from the lower paper substrate immediately after lamination, the entire array of gold spheres, from the tack layer substrate, had transferred onto the paper substrate in perfect registration with the original.
      <br/>
      This experiment thus describes the use of a tacked array sample as a master in a transfer-replication process employing a substrate with a surface which can be rendered tacky, for example by heat.
      <br/>
      The particles in this experiment were transferred to the polyethylene coated paper substrate in by a processing of heating and pressing during the lamination process.
      <br/>
      Similar experiments were performed on transparent polyethylene coated polyester substrates, low density polyethylene films, wax coated polyester, and hot melt (ethylene vinyl acetate) coated polyesters.
    </p>
    <p num="255">
      Samples prepared in this way may be used in a variety of ways.
      <br/>
      Since the substrates mentioned above are release substrates, the particle arrays on polyethylene coated paper form a convenient structure for assembling a transfer anisotropically conducting adhesive tape.
      <br/>
      The interstitial spaces between the arrayed particles were backfilled using both the wet and dry methods described in Examples 15 and 16 respectively to produce ACFs already formed on a release substrate.
      <br/>
      Thus formed ACFs were heat de-tacked onto parts, eg, glass microscope slides, ITO coupons or metalised boards, by gently heating the back side of the paper release liner, for example, whereupon the active adhesive matrix material complete with included particle arrays was deposited cleanly onto the receiving substrate without actually physically handling the thin adhesive polymer film.
    </p>
    <p num="256">Example 19</p>
    <p num="257">
      Tack array samples were produced according to the method described in Example 13 and used to prepare replica arrays on polyethylene coated paper according to the method described in Example 18.

      To an Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate coupon, such as the type used in the production of Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) oriented with the ITO side facing upwards.
      <br/>
      A few drops of Loctite 358, a UV curing adhesive were applied to an Indium Tin Oxide (ITO).
      <br/>
      The array of gold spheres on the release coated paper substrate was presented release side down to the liquid adhesive on the ITO substrate, and was tightly held in position.
      <br/>
      The assembly was irradiated briefly with UV light from the glass substrate side and the paper layer subsequently removed.
      <br/>
      Inspection showed that the array of golden spheres had transferred from the paper substrate onto the ITO substrate and was locked-in-place by the cured adhesive, which nevertheless did not completely cover the spheres.
      <br/>
      A further drop of the liquid adhesive was dispensed atop the array of spheres located on the ITO substrate and a flexible edge connector circuit was brought into contact with this and held tightly in place the adhesive was UV cured from the underside.
      <br/>
      This procedure enabled the array of golden spheres to be located in part between two conductive substrates.
      <br/>
      The assembly procedure furthermore did not displace the particle array as it had been locked in position in the first step of the two step cure-on-part procedure.
      <br/>
      Contact resistance measurements were performed to demonstrate reliable electrical interconnection between the flex circuit and the ITO mediated through the formed-in-place ACF.
    </p>
    <p num="258">Example 20</p>
    <p num="259">
      Tack array samples were prepared and replicas prepared therefrom as described in Examples 13 and 18.
      <br/>
      A few drops of a UV curable adhesive with a B-stage capability such as the second formulation described in Example 15, were placed on an opaque substrate such as metalised glass, the adhesive being in direct contact with the metal.
      <br/>
      The release coated paper substrate with particle arrays thereon was placed atop the liquid adhesive and the assembly clamped together.
      <br/>
      The assembly was irradiated from the paper side with radiation passing through the paper and curing or partially curing the adhesive.
      <br/>
      Upon removal of the release coated paper, the adhesive had adhered to the opaque substrate and the array of golden spheres had also transferred from the paper to the opaque substrate.
      <br/>
      The substrate complete with preapplied ACF was used to form a joint on another metal clad substrate by the action of heat and pressure with the joint displaying anisotropic electrical conductivity through the bondline.

    <p num="260">
      Identical experiments were conducted on polyethylene and wax coated polyesters in place of the polyethylene coated paper.
      <br/>
      These substrates had better optical clarity than the paper samples.

      The experiments described in this example indicate the feasibility of preparing preapplied ACF to opaque (to UV light) electronic devices or parts such as unbumped integrated circuits, flex connectors and metal substrates.

      <br/>
      While cyanoacrylate bonds are not known for their particular durability, they can be used in less demanding environments or in temporary ACF joints.

      An experiment was conducted as described in Example 19 up to the point where particles had been locked-in-place in arrays on the ITO substrate (to simulate an LCD).

      Instead of applying the same liquid adhesive which was used to adhere the particles to the part, a different adhesive was applied atop the structure on the part.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, a hot melt film was applied and a flexible circuit was brought to bear on said film using pressure and elevated temperature to unite the assembly.
      <br/>
      Low contact resistance measurements and optical inspection through the ITO-glass substrate indicated good electrical continuity and no particle movement on the part after bonding.
      <br/>
      The joint could be subsequently reworked by remelting the hot melt film.
    </p>
    <p num="265">
      The joint could alternatively made permanent by application of a second liquid or paste adhesive atop the array which was locked on the part.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable adhesives include two part epoxies which are highly durable, structural acrylics, and polyurethane adhesives with high peel strengths.
      <br/>
      Adhesive selection was based on application type, e.g., edge connection or chip mount, as well as whether rework was desirable or not.
    </p>
    <p num="266">Similar experiments were conducted on opaque substrates such as metalised Si wafers, FR4 circuit boards and the like using the methods described in Examples 19 and 20.</p>
    <p num="267">Example 23</p>
    <p num="268">
      Customized test circuit boards were designed to accommodate a single test chip.
      <br/>
      The test chip comprised an approximately 5 * 5 mm2 silicon substrate on which was deposited a metallic seed layer used to promote adhesion to a copper overlayer which was deposited electrodlessly.
      <br/>
      The test die had a peripheral array of 54 bumps grown on the copper layer.
      <br/>
      The square bumps measured approximately 100 microns on edge and approximately 14 microns tall and were gold plated.
      <br/>
      Bump separation was approximately 80 microns.
      <br/>
      The circuit boards had a matching electrode pattern with gold plated metalisation.
      <br/>
      The board tracks fanned out to a pad array on the periphery of the square board which was convenient for manual testing with electrical probes using the four point probe test methodology know to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      The measuring device employed was a GenRad precision digibridge.
      <br/>
      Chips were assembled on a `Finetec` Flip Chip placement machine.
    </p>
    <p num="269">
      Bonding-conditions depended on the adhesive employed but generally bondline temperatures of approximately 180 (degree)  C. were employed for approximately 60 seconds.
      <br/>
      The joints were assembled under approximately 100 N pressure applied across the entire test die.
      <br/>
      Anisotropically conductive adhesive films prepared according to the methods described in Examples 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 and 21 were employed in flip chip assembly.
      <br/>
      Overall electrical measurements typically averaged approximately 300-700 m OMEGA  per joint in laboratory tests.
    </p>
    <p num="270">Electrical measurements were also made on chip-on-board, chip-on-glass, chip-on-flex, flex-on-board, flex-on-glass and flex-on-flex assemblies demonstrating comparable joint resistances.</p>
    <p num="271">Example 24</p>
    <p num="272">
      Multiple layer anisotropically conductive adhesive films were prepared, either on flexible or rigid substrates, and on either passive (from an electrical conducting point of view) or device forming substrates according to methods outlined in previous examples (Examples 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 and 22).
      <br/>
      Thus an array of particles was established on said substrates by way of forming a tack array and transferring the array via pressing or heat and pressing array into the substrates.
      <br/>
      A bilayer structure was established through the thickness of the film by irradiating the film with UV radiation, partially curing a backfilling matrix such as that described in Example 15.
      <br/>
      Over the top of the particle array, which was partially covered with the adhesive composition was added a second covering of adhesive formulation of a different type to the first.
      <br/>
      Said second covering could be applied in either liquid or dry form, either on a flexible substrate or on a rigid substrate such as a part.
      <br/>
      In the second liquid coat option, the liquid may be solidified in a bilayer tape format or else may be solidified by curing on the part.
      <br/>
      The bilayer structure is advantageous in that it allows the formulator to tune the adhesiveness of each side of the applied film in accordance with substrate type.
    </p>
    <p num="273">Example 25</p>
    <p num="274">
      Multiple component anisotropically conductive films were prepared by establishing a particle array by the means described in previous examples and backfilling said array with formulations such those described in Example 15.
      <br/>
      In this example, however, stripe or stripes of B-stageable formulations which did not contain particles, were formed in juxtaposition to the array loaded material.
    </p>
    <p num="275">
      Similar experiments, which essentially create areas of different adhesives side-by-side, were performed in more sophisticated patterns using masking techniques.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, the photocurable, B-staging composition in Example 15 was used to surround a square pattern of particles established by transferring the tack array either by pressing alone or by a combination of heating and pressing.
      <br/>
      The square area was subsequently backfilled with a different matrix.
      <br/>
      These methods were also used to create structures in which the particle arrays were not backfilled, but walls of fully cured materials were established around said uncovered arrays.
    </p>
    <p num="276">Example 26</p>
    <p num="277">
      Particle array samples were prepared on various substrates according to the methods described in Examples 13, 14 and 18.
      <br/>
      A solvent casting formulation similar to that described in Example 14 was prepared, it differed in that no latent B-stage epoxy catalyst was included.
      <br/>
      Transfer tape embodiments of said the depleted formulation were prepared and used in a lamination operation as described in Example 17.
      <br/>
      Before laminating with a tacked array (with or without the use of heat) a latent epoxy catalyst such as DICY was sprinkled liberally atop the samples.
      <br/>
      Film inspection using polarized light optical microscopy after laminating with the previously prepared transfer tape illustrated that the (birefringent) latent catalyst had transferred across into the body of the film along with the particles.
      <br/>
      This technique facilitates thermal management of films during processing.
    </p>
    <p num="278">Example 27</p>
    <p num="279">
      Samples were prepared according to the methods described in Examples 13 and 14 but were placed on a platform which could be driven at various speeds through the central bore of a 0.6 T Halbach cylinder.
      <br/>
      The particles in the ferroadhesive formulations were randomly disposed before entering the leading edge of the magnet but were uniformly distributed throughout the sample after leaving the magnet.
      <br/>
      In addition to uniform particle separation according to the general principles of magnetic hole alignment, an additional ordering dimension (axial ordering) was achieved through the dynamics of the sample movement in the static field which tended to cause further ordering of the separated particles in lines parallel to the direction of movement of the sample.
      <br/>
      The ordering was more evident the faster the sample was traversed through the field.
      <br/>
      Axial ordering in the direction of movement of the sample for example was observed at a speed of approximately 4 m/min, for Type I, formulation 4 from Example 13.
      <br/>
      High degrees of ordering were captured by photocuring in situ in the magnetic field, i.e, by passage of the ordered sample across a beam of light.
