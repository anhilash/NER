    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention replaces to recombinant enzymes used in the conversion of type B erythrocytes to type O cells to render the cells useful for transfusion therapy.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention provide novel recombinant galactosidases.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The A, B, and H antigens are a clinically significant blood group (Landsteiner, 1901; Mollison et al, 1987).
      <br/>
      These antigens are terminal immunodominant monosaccharides on erythrocyte membrane glycoconjugates (Harmening, 1989).
      <br/>
      High densities of these epitopes are present on erythrocyte membranes and antibodies bound to these antigens readily fix complement (Economidou, et al, 1967; Romano and Mollison, 1987).
      <br/>
      Because these epitopes are ubiquitous in nature, immuno-potent and naturally occurring, complement fixing antibodies occur in individuals lacking these antigens, and transfusion of incompatible blood results in fatal hemolytic transfusion reactions (Fong et al, 1974; Schmidt, 1980).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Complex sugar chains in glycolipids and glycoproteins have often been implicated in the growth and development of eukaryotes (Watanabe et al., 1976).
      <br/>
      In particular, complex sugar chains play an important part in the recognition of self in the immune system (Mollison et al., 1987).
      <br/>
      Exoglycosidases are enzymes which can modify carbohydrate membrane epitopes, thereby modulating the immune response (Goldstein et al., 1982).
      <br/>
      The  ALPHA -D-galactosidase from Glycine is an enzyme that degrades the human blood group B epitope to the less immunogenic blood group H antigen also known as blood group O (Harpaz et al., 1977).  ALPHA -D-galactosidases ï¿½EC 3.2.1.22ï¿½ are a common class of exoglycosidases.
      <br/>
      Although physical properties of these enzymes differ as a group, and the physiological significance of these enzymes are not clearly established, isozymes of  ALPHA -D-galactosidase are common to many plant species (Flowers et al, 1979; Corchete, et al 1987).
      <br/>
      Several investigators have studied  ALPHA -D-galactosidase from Coffea (Yatziv, 1971).
      <br/>
      There are reports that several isozymes exist for the Coffea  ALPHA -D-galactosidase enzyme (Courtois, 1966).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Modification of the A, B, and H antigens using exoglycosidases to hydrolyze the terminal immunodominant residue has previously been described (Tsuji et al, 1990; Levy &amp; Aminoff, 1978; Yatziv &amp; Flowers, 1971; Kubo, 1989).
      <br/>
      Hydrolysis of the terminal N-acetyl- ALPHA -D-galactosamine by  ALPHA -N-acetyl-galactosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.49) converts blood type A2 to blood type O, and similarly, hydrolysis of the terminal  ALPHA -D-galactose residue by  ALPHA -D-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) converts blood type B to O (Yatziv &amp; Flowers, 1971; Levy &amp; Aminoff, 1978).
      <br/>
      An  ALPHA -D-galactosidase from Coffea canephora has been shown to effectively convert type B erythrocytes to type O erythrocytes (Harpaz, 1975).
      <br/>
      Because type O erythrocytes are generally universally transfusable, enzymatic deantigenation would have important medical applications.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Improvements of this technology could increase the compatible blood supply while reducing waste and risk of transfusion reactions.
      <br/>
      The primary impediments to seroconversion have been the large quantities of enzyme required for deantigenation, and washing the red cell concentrates to achieve the desired pH (Goldstein, 1989).
      <br/>
      Further, the reaction needs to take place at 24 (degree)  C. Standard transfusion medicine protocol requires treating erythrocytes at or below 24 (degree)  C. in order to decrease the possibility of bacterial contamination and maintain cell function and survival.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is commercially important to isolate enzymes and develop buffer systems in which efficient seroconversion can occur at 24 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Work by Goldstein et al., 1982, lead to the feasibility of large-scale enzymatic conversion of blood type B to O erythrocytes (Lenny et al, 1982, 1991).
      <br/>
      This group used Coffea  ALPHA -D-galactosidase in PCBS buffer to achieve deantigenation.
      <br/>
      These cells were transfused into individuals with anti-B antibodies and survived normally.
      <br/>
      The current problem with this application is that very high enzyme concentrations, about one to two grams of exoglycosidase per transfusable unit of red cells, are required for deantigenation (Lenny and Goldstein, 1991).
      <br/>
      The cost of this amount of enzyme is enormous and, without reduction, renders this technology impractical.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Data establishing the optimal ionic strength, pH, buffer species, or enzyme concentration for efficient deantigenation has not been published.
      <br/>
      It is presently unknown whether exoglycosidase activity can be modified to achieve more efficient hydrolysis of the B antigen in red cell concentrates.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,330,619, issued May 18, 1982; U.S. Pat. No. 4,427,777, issued Jan. 24, 1984; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,609,627, issued Sep. 2, 1986, all to Goldstein, relate to the enzymatic conversion of certain erythrocytes to type O erythrocytes.
      <br/>
      The above-mentioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,330,619 and 4,427,777 disclose the conversion of B-type antigen to H-type antigens by using  ALPHA -D-galactosidases from green coffee beans (Coffea canephora).
      <br/>
      The patent discloses the significant potential of such enzymes to be used in the conversion of type B erythrocytes to type O erythrocytes but does not provide a commercially feasible method.
      <br/>
      Additionally, other compounds such as tannins, present in  ALPHA -D-galactosidase enzyme extracts from plants such as Coffea beans can potentially inhibit or impair enzyme function which provides a further disadvantage for their commercial use (Goldstein et al, 1965).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      It would also be useful to have additional exoglycosidases, particularly those active at neutral pH, that could be used in the deantigenation of blood group serotypes for transfusions.
      <br/>
      However, the screening procedures currently available to undertake a survey of procaryotic species that produce exoglycosidases active at neutral pHs against blood group epitopes (Tsuji et al., 1990; Aminoff &amp; Furukawa, 1970; Levy &amp; Aminoff, 1980) and to characterize the resulting cells are cumbersome, time consuming and expensive to run.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      For example, quantitation of red cell membrane deantigenation has been accomplished by conventional hemagglutination assays.
      <br/>
      However, hemagglutination titers are not highly sensitive and are technically cumbersome.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a 50% decrease in antibody concentration only correlates with a one-fold change in titer.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is difficult to vary a large number of parameters and detect subtle changes in deantigenation using this assay.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A sensitive, rapid assay that could be used in deantigenation studies on native red blood cells and could be used for screening culture banks or selecting bacterial mutants that constitutively express blood group specific enzymes would be very useful.
      <br/>
      It would also be useful if the assay could be used to characterize other blood group specific exoglycosidases as well as blood group A active  ALPHA -N-acetyl-galactosaminidases and blood group systems I and P which express terminal immunodominant saccharide epitopes.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Finally, it would be useful to have recombinant  ALPHA -D-galactosidases available from several sources so that deantigenation protocols can be optimized with a supply of purified enzyme for more efficient production of deantigenated red blood cells.
      <br/>
      The Glycine (soybean)  ALPHA -D-galactosidase is one such galactosidase for which would be useful to have a recombinant  ALPHA -D-galactosidase available.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the Phaseolus (pinto bean)  ALPHA -D-galactosidase is another galactosidase for which it would be useful to have a recombinant supply.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND ADVANTAGES</heading>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention provides the DNA sequence of the Glycine (soybean)  ALPHA -D-galactosidase (SEQ ID No:2) and Phaseolus (pinto bean)  ALPHA -D-galactosidase (SEQ ID No:5).
      <br/>
      From these sequences, the present invention further provides a purified preparation of recombinant enzyme for Glycine  ALPHA -D-galactosidase (SEQ ID No:4) and Phaseolus  ALPHA -D-galactosidase (SEQ ID No:7) and functional analogs thereof.
      <br/>
      Purification from plants of exoglycosidases can co-isolate contaminants that are harmful and that are expensive to remove such as in Coffea extractions which contain tannins (Goldstein et al, 1965), therefore it is useful to have available recombinant exoglcosidases as well as the natural product.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      By functional analogs, it is meant that an analog will be generally at least 70% homologous over any portion that is functionally relevant.
      <br/>
      In more preferred embodiments the homology will be at least 80% and can approach 95% homology to the  ALPHA -D-galactosidase.
      <br/>
      The amino acid secuence of an analog may differ from that of the  ALPHA -D-galactosidase when at least one residue is deleted, inserted or substituted.
      <br/>
      Differences in glycosylation can provide analogs.
      <br/>
      The molecular weight of the  ALPHA -D-galactosidase can vary between the analog and the present invention due to carbohydrate differences.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Vectors which comprise the DNA of SEQ ID No:2 and SEQ ID No:5 are also provided by the present invention.
      <br/>
      The vectors can be constructed by those skilled in the art and should contain all expression elements necessary to achieve the desired transcription of the sequences.
      <br/>
      Other beneficial characteristics can also be contained within the vectors such as mechanisms for recovery of the nucleic acids in a different form.
      <br/>
      Phagemids are a specific example of such beneficial vectors because they can be used either as plasmids or as bacteriophage vectors.
      <br/>
      Examples of other vectors include viruses such as bacteriophages, baculoviruses and retroviruses, DNA viruses, cosmids, plasmids, liposomes and other recombination vectors.
      <br/>
      The vectors can also contain elements for use in either procaryotic or eucaryotic host systems.
      <br/>
      One of ordinary skill in the art will know which host systems are compatible with a particular vector.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The vectors can be introduced into cells or tissues by any one of a variety of known methods within the arts Such methods can be found generally described in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, New York (1989, 1992), and in Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Baltimore, Md. (1989), and include, for example, stable or transient transfection, lipofection, electroporation and infection with recombinant viral vectors.
      <br/>
      Introduction of nucleic acids by infection offers several advantages over the other listed methods.
      <br/>
      Higher efficiency can be obtained due to their infectious nature.
      <br/>
      Moreover, viruses are very specialized and typically infect and propagate in specific cell types.
      <br/>
      Thus, their natural specificity can be used to target the vectors to specific cell types in vivo or within a tissue or mixed culture of cells.
      <br/>
      Viral vectors can also be modified with specific receptors or ligands to alter target specificity through receptor mediated events.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The present invention also provides a pair of PCR primers (SEQ ID No:9 and SEQ ID No:10) which were designed to anneal to nucleotide sequences in the  ALPHA -D-galactosidase gene.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Further, the present invention provides a method of increasing efficiency of deantigenation of blood group epitopes on erythrocytes, seroconversion, by exoglycosidases.
      <br/>
      Generally, the method includes a step of performing deantigenation in an enhancing buffer.
      <br/>
      In an embodiment, when deantigenating either B or A epitopes using  ALPHA -D-galactosidase from Glycine and Gallus domesticus  ALPHA -N-acetyl-galactosaminidase, respectively, the method generally includes the steps of isolating A, B, and AB erythrocytes and suspending the isolated erythrocytes in a zwitterionic buffer.
      <br/>
      The appropriate exoglycosidase is then added and the cell suspension incubated at 24 (degree)  C. for between one and two hours and washed in phosphate buffered saline to remove both the exoglycosidase and enhancing buffer.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Additionally other blood types with a galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine terminal group such as P1 can be modified with the present invention.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The exoglycosidases are selected from the group consisting of Glycine (soybean)  ALPHA -D-galactosidase, Gallus domesticus (chicken)  ALPHA -N-acetyl-galactosaminidase, Phaseolus vulgaris (pinto bean)  ALPHA -D-galactosidase and other multimeric eucaryotic exoglycosidases.
      <br/>
      Monomeric enzymes, i.e. an enzyme without subunits, may also be enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The zwitterion buffer contains zwitterions selected from the group consisting of glycine, alanine, CHAPS, and zwitterions not containing additional charged groups.
      <br/>
      The glycine is used at a 220 to 440 mM concentration, in a buffer having 0.1 to 20 mM Na citrate, and 0.01 to 30 mg ml-1 albumin at pH 5.8. In a preferred embodiment, the zwitterionic buffer consists of 5 mM Na citrate, 300 mM glycine and 1 mg ml-1 albumin at pH 5.8. In a further preferred embodiment, the albumin is human serum albumin.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In determining the enhancing buffer, the type of exoglycosidase is considered.
      <br/>
      The subclass of exoglycosidases including  ALPHA -D-galactosidase from Glycine, Phaseolus and Gallus domesticus  ALPHA -N-acetyl-galactosaminidase respond to zwitterionic buffers.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The pH of the buffer is generally effective between 5.4 and 6.4 with a pH of 5.8 as the preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      Deantigenation was done at a hematocrit between 8% and 16%.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In an embodiment,  ALPHA -D-galactosidase from Glycine and Gallus domesticus  ALPHA -N-acetyl-galactosaminidase were used for deantigenation in an enhancing buffer which contained zwitterions.
      <br/>
      The optimal concentrations of the zwitterions were determined as described in Examples 2 and 3 hereinbelow.
      <br/>
      For glycine, a concentration of 220 to 440 mM was found to be optimum.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The suitability of  ALPHA -D-galactosidase from Glycine over Coffea  ALPHA -D-galactosidase was shown by the following data.
      <br/>
      Lower concentrations of  ALPHA -D-galactosidase from Glycine, as low as 2.0 U ml-1, completely removed B antigen from native erythrocytes in GCB buffer at low hematocrits in cell suspension assays.
      <br/>
      However, under similar conditions, the Coffea canephora enzyme activity was undetectable.
      <br/>
      Both enzymes had similar activities in the PCBS buffer, but, because the Glycine enzyme has a much higher specific activity, a smaller mass of enzyme was required to achieve deantigenation in PCBS buffer.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Inhibition of enzymatic activity at physiologic ionic strength ( MU  approximately 0.120 to 0.145) and low hematocrit was significant, however, isosmotic concentrations of the zwitterion glycine did not inhibit the Glycine enzyme, whereas the Coffea enzyme activity was not enhanced.</p>
    <p num="30">
      With the present invention, deantigenation with Glycine enzyme, at low hematocrits, can be achieved at higher pHs in the GCB buffer, closer to physiologic conditions.
      <br/>
      The active pH range of the Glycine enzyme was suitable for enzymatic conversion.
      <br/>
      The pH used in the deantigenation buffer system has been shown to provide recovery of viable, transfusable cells (Goldstein et al., 1987; Goldstein, 1989).
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Glycine containing buffers enhanced enzyme activity on native erythrocyte membranes.
      <br/>
      Other zwitterions had a similar effect.
      <br/>
      A hypothesis for the mechanism of the zwitterions can be made, but it is not to be construed as limiting the present invention to this one mode of action.
      <br/>
      It is thought that glycine disrupts the ion cloud around red cell membranes reducing the zeta potential.
      <br/>
      From the soluble B trisaccharide substrate studies, it was apparent that activity in GCB was similar to PCBS.
      <br/>
      This implies that glycine must somehow alter the interaction of the Glycine  ALPHA -D-galactosidase with the erythrocyte membrane enhancing hydrolysis of the B epitope.
      <br/>
      This is supported by data which shows that the effect of glycine is diminished with increasing NaCl concentrations.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The safety of use of glycine in a cell preparations to be used in humans was considered.
      <br/>
      Although glycine is a known neurotransmitter, the mean residual glycine concentration measured in the final wash buffers, 2.43  MU M, was below the reported physiologic concentration of glycine, median 275  MU M, range 120 to 386  MU M and, therefore, would not pose a problem.
      <br/>
      Further, the present invention will not provide levels of glycine where physiologic reactions have been described (Sherwood et al, 1991; Mizutani et al, 1990).
    </p>
    <p num="33">The step of incubating requires that the enzyme be active at 24 (degree)  C. The enzyme isolated from Glycine max was active at 24 (degree)  C., only slightly less than at 37 (degree)  C. Standard transfusion medicine protocol requires treating erythrocytes at or below 24 (degree)  C. in order to decrease the potential of bacterial contamination and maintain cell function and survival.</p>
    <p num="34">
      In GCB buffer, red cell function was unchanged when measured by methods described hereinbelow.
      <br/>
      The only detected antigenic change was the B and P1 epitopes in cell phenotyping. similar results have been reported for PCBS buffer with Coffea canephora  ALPHA -D-galactosidase (Goldstein et al, 1982).
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Interestingly, cells incubated in PCBS buffer developed spicules as described by others (Goldstein, 1982).
      <br/>
      However, cells incubated in GCB, however, maintain normal cell morphology.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      One of the major obstacles to seroconversion technology is the enormous quantities of enzyme required for deantigenation; approximately one to two grams of purified Coffea enzyme is required to deantigenate the B epitope from one unit of packed red blood cells (Goldstein et al, 1982; Goldstein, 1989).
      <br/>
      By using Glycine  ALPHA -D-galactosidase in a zwitterionic buffer, deantigenation at about a twenty to one hundred fold lower total enzyme mass can be achieved than with a purified Coffea enzyme.
      <br/>
      This buffer-enzyme combination is an economically feasible alternative to the Coffea enzyme in PCBS.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In an additional experiment, activity of a Gallus domesticus enzyme on erythrocyte membranes was modified by different buffer species.
      <br/>
      Maximal hydrolysis of the A epitope on red cell membranes was seen when using a PGB buffer.
      <br/>
      This further shows that glycine alters the enzyme-membrane interaction and that zwitterionic buffers can improve enzyme efficiency in deantigenation.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Coffea  ALPHA -D-galactosidase has been used in the prior art for seroconversion of B epitopes on erythrocytes, but a zwitterionic buffer was not effective in increasing its efficiency.</p>
    <p num="39">
      Applicants have developed a novel procedure (co-pending application U.S. Ser. No. 07/996,029 incorporated herein by reference) for the purification of the Coffea  ALPHA -D-galactosidase enzyme which results in a product with a specific activity of 145.7 U mg-1 min-1 which is higher than the 25 U mg-1 min-1 value previously described by others (Haibach et al., 1991; Lenny et al, 1982).
      <br/>
      Hydrolysis can be enhanced compared to PCBS by performing hydrolysis in 10 mM MES or Na citrate+140 mM NaCl at Ph 5.8. This enhancing buffer provides a two-fold increase in efficiency.
      <br/>
      MES enhancement of B epitope hydrolysis was mirrored in the soluble phase carbohydrate studies suggesting that this compound affects the enzyme rather than the erythrocyte membrane.
    </p>
    <p num="40">These findings show that increases in exoglycosidase efficiency can be achieved with changes in buffer systems.</p>
    <p num="41">
      In undertaking the above experiments, it was useful to vary a large number of parameters and detect subtle changes in deantigenation.
      <br/>
      A sensitive, rapid flow cytometry assay that can be used in deantigenation studies on native red blood cells and can be used for screening culture banks or selecting bacterial mutants that constitutively express blood group specific enzymes was developed.
      <br/>
      The method includes the steps of preparing erythrocytes in suspension and adding an exoglycosidase under a variety of buffer conditions and concentrations.
      <br/>
      Following incubation, the cells are labeled and the deantigenation efficiency monitored with a flow cytometer.
    </p>
    <p num="42">It is a useful assay that can also be used to characterize other blood group specific exoglycosidases as well as blood group A active  ALPHA -N-acetyl-galactosaminidases and blood group systems I and P which express terminal immunodominant saccharide epitopes and only require the substitution of the appropriate antibodies specific for the blood group being assayed.</p>
    <p num="43">
      The flow cytometry assay of the present invention can be used to identify optimal deantigenation conditions with sensitivity and objectivity.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, cells from larger scale assays can be harvested and their morphology/structure and function characterized.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The Coffea canephora  ALPHA -D-galactosidase currently used for deantigenation of native erythrocytes has an acidic pH optima (Kadowaki et al, 1989; Courtois &amp; Petek, 1966).
      <br/>
      Numerous procaryotic species produce exoglycosidases active at neutral pHs against blood group epitopes (Tsuji, et al, 1990; Aminoff &amp; Furukawa, 1970; Levy &amp; Aminoff, 1980).
      <br/>
      Additionally, many procaryotic exoglycosidases are active against glycolipid and glycoprotein blood group epitopes and inactive against low molecular weight chromogenic substrates (Hoskins et al, 1987).
      <br/>
      More traditional assays such as mucin or glycolipid hydrolysis followed by quantitation of liberated monosaccharide are cumbersome and time consuming.
      <br/>
      The flow cytometry assay is ideal for sensitive deantigenation studies on native red blood cells and can be used for screening culture banks or selecting bacterial mutants that constitutively express blood group specific enzymes.
      <br/>
      This assay can also be used for the characterization of other blood group specific exoglycosidases as well as blood group A active  ALPHA -N-acetyl-galactosaminidases and blood group systems I and P which express terminal immunodominant saccharide epitopes.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Flow cytometry assays can be employed to characterize enzymatic modification of these epitopes.
      <br/>
      The advantages of this assay include the use of native cells, the ability to perform large numbers simultaneously, and the ability to easily determine enzyme activity over a variety of conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The above discussion provides a factual basis for the use of the zwitterionic buffer.

    <heading>CLONING AND SEQUENCING OF GLYCINE  ALPHA -D-GALACTOSIDASE</heading>
    <p num="123">Cloning of Glycine  ALPHA -D-Galactosidase:</p>
    <p num="124">
      A Glycine (soybean) cDNA library (a gift from Joe Polacco, University of Missouri), made in lambda ZAP (Stratagene), was screened under low stringency hybridization and wash conditions with a radiolabeled portion of the pinto bean  ALPHA -D-galactosidase gene (SEQ ID No.:1) The positive clone obtained, SB-10, was excised from the lambda vector and sequenced.
      <br/>
      The deduced amino acid sequence was compared to that of the guar (Overbeek et al., 1989) and pinto bean  ALPHA -D-galactosidases.
      <br/>
      SB-10 was not full length and was missing the expected 5' end of the gene, corresponding to the start codon, signal peptide, and mature N-terminus.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      Modern soybean, Glycine max, is an allotetraploid that formed from the union of two genetically distinct species.
      <br/>
      This means that in addition to the genetic diversity bred into modern soybean for agronomic reasons, it is also likely that there are two or more different copies of the  ALPHA -D-galactosidase gene in soybean in any given soybean cultivare.
      <br/>
      As with corn, soybean is a crop planted in many climates and soil conditions.
      <br/>
      Many strains exist with different characteristics for growth under these conditions.
      <br/>
      This genetic diversity may be reflected in the amino acid sequence for soybean  ALPHA -D-galactosidase.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      The SB-10 clone Eco RI insert was radiolabeled and used as a probe to re-screen the lambda ZAP::SB cDNA library under high stringency hybridization and wash conditions.
      <br/>
      A full length clone, SB-14a, was purified and excised.
      <br/>
      The DNA of the SB-14a clone was sequenced (SEQ ID No.:2) and found to be 1750 nt in length, with a 1266 nt open reading frame encoding a protein with a 59 amino acid signal peptide (SEQ ID No.:3) and a mature length of 363 amino acids (SEQ ID No. 4).
      <br/>
      The coding region and 3' untranslated region of the soybean is set forth in SEQ ID No:8.
      <br/>
      Identity of the SB-14a cDNA clone as the gene encoding Glycine  ALPHA -D-galactosidase was confirmed by comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the clone to the N-terminal and cyanogen bromide-derived peptide sequences obtained from the native soybean  ALPHA -D-galactosidase.
      <br/>
      Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the SB-14a clone to that of other reported  ALPHA -D-galactosidases and  ALPHA -N-acetylgalactosaminidases showed a high degree of sequence similarity between the different proteins.

      Active recombinant Glycine  ALPHA -D-galactosidase was obtained with the Pichia Expression Kit (Invitrogen) using the Pichia expression/secretion vectors pHILS1 and pPIC9.
      <br/>
      Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the coding region of SB-14a.
      <br/>
      The 5' PCR primer corresponded to the mature N-terminus of the protein and contained an Eco RI site designed to allow cloning of the PCR product such that the soybean ORF was in-frame with the translation start codon provided by the Pichia expression vectors.
      <br/>
      An oligo annealing to M13-pUC was used as the 3' PCR primer.
      <br/>
      The PCR product was digested with Eco RI and cloned into the Eco RI site of pHILS1 and pPCI9.
      <br/>
      The vector-insert junctions of these constructs were sequenced to determine proper ligation, orientation, and maintenance of reading frame.

      Two clones, pHILS1/SB229 and pIC9/SB217, were chosen for expression in the Pichia system.

      Midi-prepped plasmid DNA from each clone was linearized by Aat II/Tth 111I digestion.
      <br/>
      Pichia spheroplasts were transformed with these linear constructs.
      <br/>
      Greater than fifty His+ transformants were obtained for each construct.
      <br/>
      These were screened for the His+ Mut- phenotype, which indicates correct integration of the soybean construct into the yeast chromosome.
      <br/>
      Those transformants found to be correctly integrated were grown and induced on a small scale and the culture media was assayed for  ALPHA -D-galactosidase activity.
      <br/>
      The transformant found to have the highest activity, pHILS1/SB229-32, was used for a medium scale induction and expression of the recombinant Glycine  ALPHA -D-galactosidase enzyme.
