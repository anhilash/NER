    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates in general to knife sharpeners and more specifically, to a blade sharpening apparatus capable of sharpening knives having serrations or having flat edges.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Typically, knives for many uses are constructed with a blade having either a serrated cutting edge or a flat edge.
      <br/>
      A serrated edge is particularly difficult to sharpen.
      <br/>
      Because of the nature of a serrated edge of a blade and its possible range of dimensions, known sharpener devices have not been able to satisfactorily sharpen both a serrated edge of a wide range of sizes and a straight edge in an effective manner.
      <br/>
      Prior sharpener designs have required that the sharpening stone be replaced by other stones in order to sharpen either a serrated edge, accommodate all sizes of serrations, and also sharpen flat edges.
      <br/>
      Known sharpeners also have a tendency to operate at high speeds that can cause heat build up and remove the temper of the knife blade.
      <br/>
      Past known devices are further deficient in providing a guide that permits sharpening to occur at optimum angles.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there is a need in the prior art to provide an improved knife sharpener capable of sharpening knives having serrated edges of all sizes and flat edges as well in an efficient and effective manner.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      It is, therefore, an objective of this invention to provide an improved blade sharpening apparatus capable of sharpening knives and the like having serrated edges of all sizes and flat blades.
      <br/>
      The invention of the application includes sharpening stones having an unique triangular configuration of equal sized faces that allow for superior sharpening of serrations and that allow the stones to be rotated to extend wear.
      <br/>
      The stones are moved in a back and forth stroke by an improved drive mechanism to assure superior sharpening.
      <br/>
      A slidable blade guide allows the user to select a coarse stone for initial edge sharpening or to repair damaged edges or alternatively, a fine stone to grind a final finished edge on the knife or to sharpen already sharp knives.
      <br/>
      The slidable guide also acts to provide a guide surface to sharpen a blade at an optimum angle.
      <br/>
      The knife sharpener of the invention is portable in nature and can be powered by batteries or other sources of electrical potential.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="8">
      Referring now to FIGS. 1, 1a, 1b, 2 and 3, there is illustrated the improved blade sharpening apparatus of the invention, generally designated by reference numeral 2.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, a first half portion 4a of housing 4 of the blade sharpening apparatus 2 is shown.
      <br/>
      The half portion 4a substantially conforms to the configuration of the other half portion 4b of the housing 4 which is illustrated in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The two housing portions 4a, 4b to form housing 4 are retained together by suitable mechanical fasteners and retention elements (not shown).
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 1, 1a and 2, the two portions 4a and 4b of the housing 4 include handle openings 8a and 8b formed on an enlarged end 6 of housing by which the blade sharpening apparatus 2 can be manipulated by a user.
      <br/>
      Housing 4 including portions 4a and 4b may be formed from a suitably durable plastic material.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The blade sharpening apparatus 2 is powered by a conventional electric motor 10 capable of rotating a pinion gear 12 rotatably attached to the output shaft of the motor 10.
      <br/>
      The motor 10 can be any type of electric motor that can be powered by electrical batteries (not shown) or an external electrical power source.
      <br/>
      The electrical batteries are arranged to be mounted in a suitable manner (not shown) within housing 4.
      <br/>
      In one form of the invention, the motor is driven by four "C" cell batteries, but other batteries may be used dependent on motor requirements.
      <br/>
      The batteries are electrically connected to leads 10a and 10b by a conventional electrical circuit by which an external on/off switch (not shown) is used to actuate the electric motor 10 as needed.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 3, the motor is mounted on two pairs of rigid rods 10' (two of which are shown in FIG. 3) at both ends of motor 10 in a manner to secure the motor in position as shown within housing 4.
      <br/>
      A pinion gear 12 engages a crown gear 14 that is secured to a shaft 18 and extends transverse to the axis of rotation of the pinion gear 12.
      <br/>
      The end 18a of shaft 18 engages the U-shaped slot 20a of the actuator lever 20 as seen in FIG. 3 and FIG. 10. The shaft 18 is mounted on off-center axis with respect to the center of the crown gear 14 to drive the actuator lever 20 and produce a back and forth motion on the actuator lever 20.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 3, the actuator lever 20 extends up through a opening 22 provided in an intermediate upper wall 24 of housing 4.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The top end of actuator lever 20 is secured to a grinding stone holder 30 as seen in FIGS. 2, 3 and 10.
      <br/>
      The stone holder 30 includes a pair of pockets 32 for respectively receiving a pair of grinding stones 34 and 36 as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The stones 34 and 36 respectively comprise a fine stone and a coarse stone for various sharpening operations.
      <br/>
      For example, the coarse stone 36 may be used to sharpen the serrated edge or flat edge of a damaged blade or can be used in an initial sharpening operation.
      <br/>
      The fine stone 34 can be used to finish a sharpening operation or to sharpen up relatively sharp edges.
      <br/>
      As will be discussed later, the stones 34 and 36 can be alternately exposed for sharpening by sliding the angle guide 38 that is disposed above the stones.
      <br/>
      The angle guide 38 is slidable in either direction to expose one of the stones 34, 36 and cover the other stone as will be described later.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIGS. 1 and 2, the stones 34 and 36 are mounted above housing top 24 in a depressed area which is disposed intermediate of the length of the housing 4.
      <br/>
      The actuator lever 20 moves the stone holder 30 and the stones 34, 36 in a limited back and forth stroke along the longitudinal axis of the housing 4 for an extent, for example, of 1/16" or other suitable distance.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In FIGS. 7, 8 and 9, it is shown that the two pockets 32 of stone holder 30 are closed at one end by triangular shaped projections 40.
      <br/>
      The stones 34 and 36 each have a triangular cross section of a configuration having equal sides by which a lower flat side rests respectively in pockets 32 of the stone holder 30.
      <br/>
      The stone holder 30 includes a pair of holes 42 by which a screw or other threaded member may engage the stones 34 and 36 to retain them in position on stone holder 30 and allow that the stones to be removed.
      <br/>
      Because of the triangular shape of the stones 34 and 36, they are capable of being rotated to extend the useful lifetime service of sharpening.
      <br/>
      The unique shape of the triangular stones further effectively sharpens serrated blade edges of any size and can also be used to sharpen flat blades with effectiveness without changing the stone.
      <br/>
      The lower body 44 of the stone holder 30 is mounted on a stone holder rack 50 as best seen in FIGS. 11, 12 and 13.
      <br/>
      The area of the cross-section of stones 34 and 36 is larger than the area of triangular shaped projections 40, such that the upper surfaces 34a, 36a extend beyond projections 40 as shown in phantom in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The stone holder 30 is further provided with a pair of open ended slots 46 at each end.
      <br/>
      Both the stone holder 30 and the stone holder rack 50 may be fabricated from a plastic or other durable material.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Referring now to FIGS. 1, 2, 3 and 11 to 13, there is illustrated the stone holder rack 50 upon which is the stone holder 30 is mounted.
      <br/>
      The stone holder rack 50 is suitably retained on housing 4 and permits the back and forth motion of the stone holder rack 50.
      <br/>
      The stone holder rack 50 includes a flat bottom member 52 having an opening 54 through which actuator lever 20 extends.
      <br/>
      A pair of the flat projections 56 project upward at a position inward from the opposite edges of flat bottom member 52.
      <br/>
      Two pairs of aligned holes 58 are provided in upward projections 56.
      <br/>
      The holes 58 receive pins 60 as best seen in FIG. 1 with said pins 60 being positioned in end slots 46 of stone holder 30.
      <br/>
      The pins 60 retain the stone holder 30 and stones 34, 36 from raising up when pressure is being applied by a blade to a stone during sharpening.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Referring to FIGS. 1, 4, 5, 6, 14 and 15 details of the blade angle guide 38 are shown.
      <br/>
      Although not so limited, the blade angle guide 38 can be fabricated from a suitable metal and the like.
      <br/>
      The blade angle guide 38 is formed as a one-piece body 70 having an intermediate upper blade sharpening section 72.
      <br/>
      The sharpening section 72 includes a pair of lower ledges 74 intersecting a pair of sloped side surfaces 76.
      <br/>
      The side surfaces 76 terminate with a pair of flat blade angle surfaces 80 and 82 which angle downward toward the center of blade sharpening section 72.
      <br/>
      The angles of incline of surfaces 80, 82 are selected to act as a base surface and guide for a blade (not shown) being sharpening for engaging a selected stone 34 and 36 at an optimum angle.
      <br/>
      An opening 84 is provided in surfaces 80 and 82 to allow the upper edge portion (FIG. 1) of either triangular stone 34 or 36 to project upward through opening 84 for sharpening.
      <br/>
      The sharpening section 72 is integral with two end portions 86 and 88 by two pairs of transverse sections 90, 92 disposed above ledges 74 and adjacent sloped surface 76.
      <br/>
      The end portion 86 is formed by an upper surface 96 and a pair of side sections 98 forming an open bottom in a modified inverted U-shape.
      <br/>
      The end portion 88 similarly includes an upper surface 100 and a pair of side sections 102 also having a modified inverted U-shape.
      <br/>
      The outer surface of at least end portion 88 has a gripping surface, such as ribs 88a as shown in FIG. 4, 5, 6, 14 and 15.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      As seen in FIGS. 1, 1a and 1b the blade guide is moveable between a wall 104 correspondingly formed on housing portions 4a, 4b to stop surface 106 adjacent one end of housing 4.
      <br/>
      The housing 4 forms an open blade guide compartment 108 for the receiving end portion 86 of blade guide 38 in the position shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 1, the compartment 108 is formed by back wall 104, upper and lower walls 110a, 110b and side wall 112 (one of which is shown) which have a configuration to receive end section 86 through opening 113 with end 86a of end portion 86 is in contact or near contact with a back wall 104.
      <br/>
      In the position of blade angle guide 38 shown in FIG. 1, stone 36 is exposed for sharpening, while stone 34 is covered.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The blade guide 38 is further moveable to a second position exposing stone 34 and covering stone 36 by which the end 88' of portion 88 contacts or is in near contact with stop 106.
      <br/>
      The end portion 88 moves into surrounding exterior relation to upper reduced section 114 of the housing 4 having a correspondingly similar but smaller configuration than the cross sectional shape of end portion 88 as seen in FIGS. 1a and 1b. The blade guide 38 moves on its lower edge along the housing 4 on lower wall l110b, wall 24 and a ledge 116.
      <br/>
      The ledge 116 is outwardly disposed below upper reduced section 114 under which a slot 118 is formed.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIGS. 6 and 14, a pin 120 is attached to the lower edges of end portion 88 of blade guide 38 to engage the slot 118 for movement and securement.
      <br/>
      A portion of the end portion 86 of blade guide 38 is captured in compartment 108 when end 88' contacts stop 106 to aid in securement.
