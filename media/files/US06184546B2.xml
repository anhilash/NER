      A high-barrier gate field-effect transistor with an n+-GaAs/p+-GaInP/n-GaAs heterojunctions has been fabricated.
      <br/>
      The channel contains tri-step doped GaAs layers with a different doping level and thickness in each layer.
      <br/>
      Due to the significant conduction band discontinuity DELTAEC between GaInP/GaAs heterointerface in the gate region, the gate barrier is increased and electrons are effectively confined in the channel.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the existence of a valance band discontinuity DELTAEv at the GaInP/GaAs heterointerface may prevent holes generated by impact ionization from reaching the gate region.
      <br/>
      The tri-step doped channel is adopted to increase the output current and linear transconductance.
      <br/>
      Therefore the device of this invention provides a high gate-drain breakdown voltage, a low leakage current and a high transconductance.
      <br/>
      Based on these advantages, the proposed device shows the promise for high-power, large signal analog, and digital switching circuit applications.

      Description of Prior Art
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Recently, many semiconductor devices with the very thin and sharply doped layer have been developed because of the advancement of film growth techniques, such as MOCVD and MBE and so on.
      <br/>
      Among them, the Ga0.51 In0.49 P epitaxial layer lattices matched to GaAs have been received much attention.
      <br/>
      GaInP material has the advantages of (1) lower deep level trap; (2) highly selective etch ration between GaInP and GaAs materials; (3) large break down voltage; (4) larger valance band discontinuity between GaInP and GaAs materials; (5) the elimination of DX centers and thermal oxidation as compared to AlGaAs.
      <br/>
      Therefore, GaInP/GaAs heterostructure has been widely used in high speed and microwave devices, such as heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT) or heterojunction field-effect transistors (HFET), etc.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      As mentioned above, due to the excellent characteristics of GaInP epitaxial layer.
      <br/>
      The object of this invention is to provide a high-barrier gate and tri-step doped channel field-effect transistor with an n+ -GaAs/p+ -GaInP/n-GaAs heterojunctions.
      <br/>
      The channel contains tri-step doped GaAs layers with different doping level and thickness in each layer.
      <br/>
      Due to the significant conduction band discontinuity  DELTA EC between the GaInP/GaAs heterointerface in the gate region, the gate barrier is increased and electrons are effectively confined in the channel.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the existence of a valance band discontinuity  DELTA Ev at the GaInP/GaAs heterointerface may prevent holes generated by impact ionization from reaching the gate regime.
      <br/>
      The tri-step doped channel can increase the output current and linear transconductance.
      <br/>
      The device of this invention has the characteristics of high gate-drain breakdown voltage, low leakage current and high transconductance, etc.
      <br/>
      Based on these advantages, the device shows promise in high-power, large signal analog and digital switching circuit applications.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Moreover, the "camel gate"-like structure has the following advantages: (1) the ohmic contact gate can eliminate the difficulty of making a metal-semiconductor contact; (2) the gate barrier height is large and adjustable, however it is not fixed and is affected by the applied gate voltages; (3) the potential for improving reliability under conditions of high power dissipation.</p>

    <p num="8">Referring to FIG. 1, from bottom to top, the device of this invention contains: a semi-insulating GaAs substrate 20; a layer of undoped GaAs 22 with a thickness of 0.5  MU m; a layer of p+ -GaAs 24 with a thickness of 50  Angstrom  and a concentration of 8 * 1018 cm-3 ; a layer of undoped GaAs 26 with a thickness of 500  Angstrom ; a tri-step n-doped GaAs channel which comprises a first step 28c with a thickness of 200  Angstrom  and a concentration of 5 * 1017 cm-3, a second step 28b with a thickness of 400  Angstrom  and a concentration of 2.5 * 1017 cm-3, and a third step 28a with a thickness of 1000  Angstrom  and a concentration of 1 * 1017 cm-3 ; a layer of p+ -GaInP 30 with a thickness of 100  Angstrom  and a concentration of 6 * 1018 cm-3 ; a ohmic contact layer of n+ -GaAs 32 with a thickness of 300  Angstrom  and a concentration of 6 * 1018 cm-3 ; and gate metal Au 34 and drain and source metals Au/Ge/Ni 36 and 38, serving as an ohmic contact, deposited on the n+ -GaAs layer 32, respectively.</p>

      FIG. 2 shows the energy-band diagram for the device of this invention, EC represents the conduction band discontinuity, EF represents the Fermi level, and Ev represents the valance band discontinuity.
      <br/>
      It is found that a conductance band discontinuity  DELTA EC of about 200 meV existed between the aInP/GaAs heterointerface in the gate region, thus electrons are effectively confined in the channel.
      <br/>
      This can improve the transconductance and reduce the leakage current.
      <br/>
      In addition, the existence of  DELTA Ev, which is about 300 meV, at the GaInP/GaAs heterointerface may prevent holes generated by impact ionization from reaching the gate region.
      <br/>
      Thus a higher gate-drain breakdown voltage can be obtained.

      FIG. 3 shows the characteristics of the current-voltage of the device in this invention.
      <br/>
      The transversal axis indicates the drain-source voltage (VDS) with a scale of 1 V. The longitudinal axis indicates the drain current (IDS) with a scale of 2 mA.
      <br/>
      The gate-source voltage (VGS) is -0.5V/step.
      <br/>
      It is found that the device of this invention has an excellent pinch-off behavior, the threshold voltage is about -2.5 V. For a gate dimension of 1 * 50  MU m2, the cut-off frequency (ft) is 17 GHz, which is measured by using an HP8510B Network Analyzer manufactured by HEWLETT PACKARD Co.

    <p num="11">
      FIG. 4 shows the characteristics of the gate current-voltage of the device.
      <br/>
      The transversal axis represents the gate-drain voltage (VGD) with a scale of 2.5V. The longitudinal axis indicates the gate current (IG) with a scale of 0.1 mA. It is found that the gate leakage current is only 250  MU A/mm when the gate breakdown voltage is 33 V. Such a superior characteristic is in agreement with the corresponding band diagram of FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 5 shows the relation of drain saturation current, transconductance, and gate voltage for the device of this invention.
      <br/>
      The drain-source voltage is 6 V. The transversal axis represents the gate-source voltage (VGS) with a scale of 0.25V. The left longitudinal axis represents the transconductance with a scale of 15 mS/mm.
      <br/>
      The right longitudinal axis indicates the drain saturation current (IDS) with a scale of 40 mA/mm.
      <br/>
      The maximum transconductance is 140 mS/mm when the gate-source voltage is -0.5 V, for a 1 * 50  MU m2 gate device.
