    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a 3-isochromanone useful as an intermediate of medicals or agricultural chemicals, and a method for manufacturing a cyano compound which can be used as a starting material in the manufacturing method of 3-isochromanones.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      For manufacturing a 3-isochromanone represented by the later described formula (II), some different methods have been proposed.
      <br/>
      For example, JP-A-9-67364 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") discloses a method of reacting  ALPHA , ALPHA '-dihalogeno-o-xylene with carbon monoxide and water in the presence of a hydrogen halogenide scavenger and a-complex catalyst containing a metal such as palladium.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, A. Cowell et al have reported that 3-isochromanone is synthesized by reacting o-bromomethylbenzyl alcohol with carbon monoxide in the presence of a palladium complex catalyst (JACS., 102, 4191 (1980)).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Also, in some methods hitherto proposed, 3-isochromanone is synthesized by the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation reaction using 2-indanone as a starting material.
      <br/>
      More specifically, A. Chatterjee et al, P. Cottet et al and C. Kocch et al disclose a method of synthesizing 3-isochromanone by reacting 2-isodandne with a metachloroperbenzoic acid (see, Synthesis, 818 (1981), Synthesis, 497 (1987), Synthetic Communication, 19, 829 (1989)). F. G. Mann et al disclose a method of synthesizing 3-isochromanone by reacting  ALPHA -methoxy- ALPHA '-cyano-o-xylene in an aqueous sulfuric acid solution (see, J. Chem. Soc., 2819 (1954)).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, U. Azzena et al disclose a method of synthesizing 3-isochromanone by ring-opening phthalan with a metal lithium, reacting it with carbon dioxide and hydrolyzing the reaction product (see, Tetrahedron Lett., 36, 8123 (1995)).
    </p>
    <p num="5">However, these methods are not an industrially useful method because the starting materials are difficult to be synthesized and prevented from the industrial use for general purposes, an expensive reagent or catalyst is necessary to be used or the yield is low.</p>
    <heading>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">The object of the present invention is to manufacture a 3-isochromanone represented by formula (II) by an industrially advantageous method in a high yield.</p>

    <p num="21">Still more, in the above method, it is preferred that an aprotic polar solvent is added to the reaction system of the  ALPHA , ALPHA '-dihalogeno-o-xylene compound with the carboxylic acid alkali salt.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="22">The present invention is described in detail below.</p>
    <p num="23">Manufacturing Method of 3-Isochromanones (II)</p>
    <p num="24">The cyano compound (I) is hydrolyzed with an alkali such as sodium hydroxide according to reaction scheme (a):  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="25">
      to synthesize a 2-(hydroxymethyl)phenylacetic acid compound (V).

    <p num="27">Furthermore, the cyano compound (I) may be subjected to hydrolysis and intramolecular cyclization at the same time in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid according to reaction scheme (d):  (Chemical Structure image '10' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="28">to synthesize a 3-isochromaonone (II).</p>
