    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (collectively referred to herein as CPPS) is a syndrome of undetermined etiology occurring in men.
      <br/>
      CPPS is the third of four subgroups of prostatitis recognized by the NIH.
      <br/>
      Category I encompasses acute bacterial prostatitis, and Category II covers chronic bacterial infection.
      <br/>
      Category III, CPPS, includes all remaining prostatitis syndromes, and is subdivided into IIIa (inflammatory) and IIIb (non-inflammatory).
      <br/>
      These sub-categories can be distinguished by the presence of leukocytosis in expressed prostatic secretions or sediment in a post-massage urine sample.
      <br/>
      Finally, Category IV represents asymptomatic prostatitis, which often is associated with benign prostate hyperplasia.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Prostatitis is extraordinarily common, resulting in approximately 2 million office visits to primary care physicians and urologists in the United States annually �1997 American Urological Association Annual Meeting, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, National Center for Health Statistics, 1990 to 1994�. Patients with CPPS suffer from chronic, episodic pain in the perineum or pelvic region, irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms, and adverse effects upon sexual function �Alexander et al., Urology 48:568-574 (1996)�. Men with chronic prostatitis often require repeated physician visits, commonly to different physicians.
      <br/>
      Medical expenditures relating to CPPD are conservatively estimated to exceed half a billion dollars annually.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Bacterial vs.
      <br/>
      Non-Bacterial Prostatitis
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Given its apparent prevalence, CPPS has defied characterization to an almost astonishing extent.
      <br/>
      While an enormous number of patients seek the care of a physician because of prostatitis-like symptoms, almost nothing is known about diagnostic criteria, etiology, or objective signs for CPPS.
      <br/>
      In a survey conducted through the Internet of 163 men with a diagnosis of prostatitis, Alexander and Trissel found that pain in the pelvic region was the most frequently reported and the most severe symptom in such patients �Alexander et al., Urology 48:568-74 (1996)�. It was because of these observations and the paucity of objective criteria for defining the disease, that the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases working group in prostatitis suggested that the disease be named Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One reason for the present state of confusion regarding CPPS is the similarity of CPPS symptoms to the symptoms of bacterial prostatitis.
      <br/>
      Only about 5 to 10% of patients whose symptoms are consistent with bacterial prostatitis are shown to have infection in the prostate gland �Weidner et al., Infection 19:S109-S190 (1991)�. The misdiagnosis of CPPS as infectious prostatitis, commonly results in unnecessary treatment with multiple courses of antibiotics at enormous cost to patients and to the health care system with no clearly demonstrated benefit to patients.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      An enormous amount of effort has attended the search for a fastidious organism as the cause of CPPS.
      <br/>
      No clear consensus has emerged identifying any such organism as the causative agent.
      <br/>
      Published studies have proven difficult to interpret due to lack of a standardized definition of CPPS and the variability in methodologies for detecting infectious organisms.
      <br/>
      Another difficulty with published studies is that the presence of normal flora in the male urethra complicates the interpretation of culture data.
      <br/>
      Further, many published studies lack control groups to which the findings in men with prostatitis must be compared.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Recently, Krieger et al. reported an extensive study examining trans-perineal prostate biopsies in 135 men with CPPS for bacterial 16s rRNA-encoding DNA sequences �Krieger et al, J. Clin. Microbiol 34:3120-3128 (1996)�. Krieger et al. found that 77% of the CPPS patients had bacterial DNA sequences in their prostatic tissue that were distinct from normal bowel and skin flora.
      <br/>
      Patients with bacterial DNA sequences in the prostate also had higher numbers of leukocytes in the prostatic fluid compared to patients without such DNA sequences.
      <br/>
      Krieger et al. concluded that bacteria distinct from the normal bowel and skin flora are present in the prostatic tissue of men with CPPS and are therefore a potential causative agent of CPPS.
    </p>
    <p num="9">In another study by the same group, Berger et. al reported that an aerobic or anaerobic bacterial organism could be cultured from the prostate tissue in 32% of 85 symptomatic men by performing cultures of trans-perineal needle biopsies in a specialized microbiology laboratory �Berger et al., J. Urol. 157:863-865 (1997)�.</p>
    <p num="10">
      However, the Krieger et al. and Berger et al. data cannot be interpreted as positively identifying a causative agent for prostatitis because neither study compared the CPPS group with a control group lacking symptoms of CPPS to demonstrate that the prostate tissue of subjects without CPPS symptoms does not contain such bacterial DNA sequences.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, in preliminary data, the present inventors have detected similar diverse bacterial 16s rRNA-encoding DNA sequences in 8/9 patients undergoing transperineal radioactive seed implantation for localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate, all of whom had no antecedent history of CPPS symptoms �S.
      <br/>
      Keay et al, Urology 53: 487-491, 1999�. Thus, while the data of Krieger et. al. show that bacterial DNA sequences exist in the prostate of men with CPPS, the presence of these sequences is not sufficient to demonstrate a bacterial origin for CPPS.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      What is clear, however, is that some men with CPPS have evidence of inflammation of the prostate.
      <br/>
      While the cellular and cytokine mediators involved in the inflammatory process have been increasingly clarified in the immunologic literature, few studies have investigated the immunobiology of the prostate gland to determine whether CPPS might be arise from an auto-immune condition.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Autoimmunity and the Prostate</p>
    <p num="13">
      Many diseases are known to result from autoimmunity.
      <br/>
      The present inventors have discovered that CPPS has an autoimmune component.
      <br/>
      The inventors hypothesize that either (1) the autoimmune component of CPPS results from an autoimmune attack upon the prostate, or (2) that a chronic inflammatory process is maintained in CPPS patients as a result of a breakdown of immunoregulatory mechanisms in the immediate environment of the prostate.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      There is a substantial body of evidence demonstrating the occurrence of immunological activity within the prostate gland.
      <br/>
      However, the nature and cause of this activity, and whether it is detrimental to the host, has not been determined.
      <br/>
      Inflammatory infiltrates in the prostate are very common.
      <br/>
      In one study of 162 cases of surgically resected prostatic tissue inflammatory infiltrates were found in 98% �Kohnen et al., J. Urology 121:755-60 (1979)�. The infiltrating cells consist of monocytes and activated T and B lymphocytes �Theyer et al., Lab Invest. 66:96-107 (1992); Steiner et al., J. Urology 151:480-84 (1994)�.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      A rare form of prostatic inflammation, granulomatous prostatitis, has been characterized, although the etiology of the inflammation is also unknown.
      <br/>
      One of the major theories about this disease, however, is that it represents an immune reaction against self prostatic proteins induced by infection or manipulation of the gland by previous biopsy or surgical procedure �Stillwell et al., J. Urology 138:320-23 (1987); Dhundee et al., Histopathology 18:435-41 (1991)�.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The disease is also observed after instillation of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) into the bladder as a treatment for superficial bladder cancer �Bahnson, J. Urology 146:1368-69(1991)�.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Recent observations about the existence of subsets of CD4+ T cells has yielded fundamental information about immune responses in humans.
      <br/>
      CD4+ T cells can be separated into subsets based upon the patterns of cytokines they secrete �Mosmann, Ann NY Acad.
      <br/>
      Sci. 664:89-92 (1992)).
      <br/>
      CD4+ T cells that secrete IFN- GAMMA  and IL-2 are called T helper 1 (Th1) cells.
      <br/>
      Th1 cells mediate cellular immunity, such as delayed hypersensitivity responses.
      <br/>
      CD4+ T cells that secrete IL-4 and IL-10 are termed T helper 2 (Th2).
      <br/>
      Th2 cells are associated with antibody production and allergy.
      <br/>
      Immune responses mediated by Th1 and Th2 cells can be characterized by the local cytokine environment during the developing immune response.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Zisman et al. found IgG anti-PSA antibody titers to be higher in the serum of men with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) compared to controls �Zisman et al., J. Urology 154:1052-55 (1995)�. However, of 17 men with chronic prostatitis, Zisman et al. found no difference in mean antibody titer as compared to controls.
      <br/>
      Zisman et al. speculate that an immunologic mechanism may play a role in the symptomatology of BPH.
      <br/>
      An alternative explanation is that a Th1 type of response may be occurring in patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.
      <br/>
      In this event, no antibody response would be expected.
      <br/>
      A further understanding of the local cytokine environment in the prostate will be critical to understanding the nature of the inflammatory response that is occurring in order to more clearly understand the disease.
    </p>
    <p num="19">There remains a major need in the art for an objective means for diagnosing CPPS, to identify the cause or causes of the syndrome and for CPPS treatments that can result in an improvement in symptoms in men with the disease.</p>
    <p num="20">Cytokines</p>
    <p num="21">
      Cytokines are small to medium-sized proteins or glycoproteins which mediate potent biological effects on most cell types. �See Mire-Sluis, et al., eds. Cytokines (1998); also see Thompson, Angus, ed.
      <br/>
      The Cytokine Handbook (1998)� While cytokines were originally identified as key components in inflammatory processes, it is now known that cytokines are involved in many non-inflammatory physiological processes.
      <br/>
      Cytokines mediate their effects by binding to specific cell surface receptors which are coupled to intracellular signal transduction and second messenger pathways.
      <br/>
      More than one hundred cytokines have been identified to date.
      <br/>
      The inventors have identified the following cytokines as having particular importance in the operation of the present invention: IL8, GM-CSF, IL- BETA  and TNF- ALPHA .
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      IL-8 is a member of the chemokine family of cytokines.
      <br/>
      IL-8 is produced by many cell types.
      <br/>
      In general, the biological activity of IL-8 results from its ability to activate the CXC chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2.
      <br/>
      Among many other functions, IL-8 acts as a neutrophil chemoattractant and activating factor �Matsushima et al., Cytokine 1:2-13 (1989); Matsushima et al., J. Exp. Med. 167:1883-1893 (1988); Oppenheim et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:617-648 (1991)�. Synonyms for IL-8 include neutrophil attractant/activating protein (NAP-1), monocyte derived neutrophil activating peptide (MONAP), monocyte derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (MDNCF), neutrophil activating factor (NAF), leukocyte adhesion inhibitor (LAI), Granulocyte chemotactic protein (GCP).
      <br/>
      IL-8 can be obtained from known commercial sources.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      GM-CSF, or granulocytelmacrophage colony stimulating factor, is a survival and growth factor for haematopoietic progenitor cells, a differentiation and activating factor for granulocytic and monocytic cells, and a growth factor for endothelial cells, erythroid cells, megakaryocytes and T cells �Wong et al., Science 228:810-815 (1985); Gough et al., EMBO. J. 4:645-653 (1985); Clarke et al., Science 236: 1229-1237 (1987); Groopman et al., New Eng. J. Med. 321, 1449-1459 (1989)�. GM-CSF is also known as CSFa or pluripoietin-a.
      <br/>
      GM-CSF can be obtained from known commercial sources.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      IL-1 BETA  has a wide range of biological activities on many different target cell types including B cells, T cells, and monocytes (Dinarello et al., Adv. Immunol. 44:153-205 (1989); Fuhlbrigge et al., In The Year in Immunology 1988: Immunoregulatory Cytokines and Cell Growth, Vol. 5, Cruse et al., pp.21-37 (1989); di Giovine et al. lmmunol.
      <br/>
      Today 11:13-20 (1990)�. In vivo, IL-1 BETA  induces hypotension, fever, weight loss, neutrophilia, and acute phase response.
      <br/>
      IL-1 BETA  can be obtained from known commercial sources.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine secreted by both lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells which regulates B and T cell function, haematopoiesis and acute phase reactions �Hirano, in The Cytokine Handbook, Thomson, ed., Academic Press, London, pp. 169-190 (1991); Kishimoto, Blood 74:1-10 (1989); Kishimoto, et al., Science 258:593-597 (1992)�. Synonyms for IL-6 include interferon- BETA 2, 26-kDa protein, B cell stimulatory factor 2 (BSF-2), hybridoma/plasmacytoma growth factor (HPGF or IL-HP1), hepatocyte stimulating factor (HSF), monocyte granulocyte inducer type 2 (MGI-2), cytotoxic T cell differentiation and thrombopoietin.
      <br/>
      IL-6 is produced by a large member of cell types, including lymphoid cells (T cells, B cells) and many non-lymphoid cells including macrophages, bone marrow stromal cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, mesangium cells, astrocytes and endothelial cells.
      <br/>
      IL-6 can be obtained from known commercial sources.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      TNF- ALPHA  is a potent paracrine and endocrine mediator of inflammatory and immune functions.
      <br/>
      It is also known to regulate growth and differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.
      <br/>
      TNF- ALPHA  is selectively cytotoxic for many transformed cells, especially in combination with IFN- GAMMA .
      <br/>
      In vivo, it leads to necrosis of methylcholanthrene-induced murine sarcomas.
      <br/>
      Many of the actions of TNF- ALPHA  occur in combination with other cytokines as part of the "cytokine network" �Manogue et al.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="32">
      The present invention provides a method for diagnosing CPPS comprising analyzing a semen component for an elevated level of a cytokine.
      <br/>
      The semen component is preferably seminal plasma, and the cytokine is preferably selected from the group consisting of GM-CSF, IL-1- BETA , IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-. More preferably, the cytokine is TNF- ALPHA .
      <br/>
      The present invention also provides a method for treating the CPPS by administering a cytokine inhibitor, such as a TNF- ALPHA  inhibitor.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The present inventors evaluated a group of men with a history of CPPS for reactivity with normal seminal plasma as compared to a control group.
      <br/>
      The control group consisted of 15 individuals, including 3 individuals with no history of any urologic problem or symptoms who underwent leukopheresis, and 12 volunteer male blood donors whose buffy coat leukocytes were obtained 24 hours after blood donation.
      <br/>
      The CPPS group consisted of 10 men who were referred to the VA Maryland Health Care System Urology Section or the University of Maryland Division of Urology with a history of CPPS.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The results of the proliferation assay are shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The mean SEM (counts per minute) for the proliferation assay are shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      These data show that a subpopulation of men with CPPS had a significant recall proliferative response to seminal plasma pulsed PBMCs, and that this response was not observed in the control group.
      <br/>
      Both normal subjects and patients with CPPS had equivalent and significant responses to the recall antigens tetanus toxoid and Candida extract.
      <br/>
      The recall response to seminal plasma was dose-dependent and the antigen appears to be contained within the secretions of the prostate.
      <br/>
      A similar recall response was observed when the seminal plasma was obtained from men with seminal vesicle atresia or from normal male volunteers.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The data clearly show that an autoimmune response to self prostatic proteins is occurring in men with the clinical syndrome of CPPS.
      <br/>
      The antigenic material in seminal plasma is presumably processed and presented by antigen-presenting cells in PBMCs.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      To further characterize the observed autoimmune response, the present inventors analyzed seminal plasma for the presence of cytokines.
      <br/>
      Measurement of cytokine levels in the semen of men with CPPS represents an objective measure of genital tract inflammation as cytokines are mediators of the inflammatory response.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The pattern of seminal cytokines observed so far suggests that macrophage products proximal in the inflammatory cytokine cascade are elevated in men with chronic non-bacterial prostatitis.
      <br/>
      The T-cell cytokine IFN- GAMMA  was not detected in controls or CPPS patients (data not shown).
      <br/>
      The correlation of IL-1 ALPHA  and TNF- ALPHA  levels (FIG. 8) strongly suggests that these cytokines are physiologically present in the semen because of some stimulus.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Elevated levels of TNF- ALPHA  in these patients is particularly intriguing.
      <br/>
      TNF- ALPHA  is a critical proximal mediator in several known autoimmune conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.
      <br/>
      Recent prospective, randomized, blind trials in these two diseases have clearly shown that blocking TNF- ALPHA  with antibodies or receptor antagonists improves symptoms and signs of these diseases in patients �Moreland et al., N.Engl.J.Med. 337:141-47 (1997); Targan et al., N.Engl.J.Med. 337:1029-35 (1997)�.
    </p>
    <p num="39">The inventors have discovered that cytokines useful in the diagnosis of CPPS include GM-CSF, IL-1- BETA , IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-. However, it will be apparent to those in the art that it is a routine matter in light of the instant disclosure to test seminal fluid of subjects with CPPS symptoms for all known cytokines to determine whether further cytokines are elevated in such subjects.</p>
    <p num="40">
      The most sensitive method ever applied to detect circulating human TNF- ALPHA , based on extremely high binding specificity and affinity of the p55 TNF- ALPHA  receptor for TNF- ALPHA , failed to detect any circulating TNF- ALPHA  protein in healthy humans �Poltorak et al., J. Immunol. Methods 169:93-99 (1994)�. The detection limit of this assay is 200 attomolar (10-18  mol L-1), which equals 120,000 TNF- ALPHA  trimers or 10 femtograms in 1 ml plasma.
      <br/>
      By contrast, in acute diseases such as septic shock, TNF- ALPHA  circulates in nanomolar (10-9 mol L-1) concentrations.
    </p>
    <p num="41">Methods for Diagnosing CPPS</p>
    <p num="42">
      The methods of the subject invention exploit the inventors' discovery of the relationship between cytokine levels in seminal plasma to CPPS.
      <br/>
      The inventors have shown that cytokines are secreted in measurable quantities in the semen of men with CPPS, and hence can be used for diagnostic purposes.
      <br/>
      The diagnostic methods of the present invention provide a more objective, accurate, and quantifiable measure of inflammation in the prostate of men with CPPS.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Collection of semen from men suspected of having CPPS may be accomplished via any known method.
      <br/>
      Semen is preferably incubated at ambient temperature for 30 minutes, followed by centrifugation, results in the recovery of supernatant, referred to herein as "seminal plasma." Cytokine levels are preferably measured in this seminal plasma, but may also be measured in other semen components or fractions, such as expressed prostatic secretions
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Cytokine assay of the seminal plasma may be accomplished by any known method for identifying and quantifying a protein or peptide in a body sample.
      <br/>
      Preferred assays are immunoassays, such as radioimmunoassays.
      <br/>
      The most preferred method is the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) employing commercially available monoclonal antibodies.
      <br/>
      Various receptor binding assays may also be employed in the diagnostic methods of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Methods for Treating CPPS</p>
    <p num="46">
      The invention also provides a method for treating men determined to be suffering from a disorder associated with elevated levels of one or more cytokines in one or more components or fractions of semen, preferably seminal plasma, comprising administering one or more anti-cytokine agents, such as anti-TNF- ALPHA  agents.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments of the claimed methods, the anti-cytokine agent is administered to a patient suffering from a disorder falling within the definition of CPPS, including prostatitis.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The anti-cytokine agent may be provided in a formulation suitable for administration to a patient.
      <br/>
      Such formulations are known in the art and depend on the chemical and physiological characteristics of the particular anti-cytokine agent.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The dosage regimen is readily determined by one of skill in the art, taking into account various factors which affect the action of the particular anti-TNF- ALPHA  agent.
      <br/>
      For example, dosage may vary depending on the condition, type and/or severity of damaged tissue; the patient's age and/or diet; time, mode, and/or route of administration, as well as other clinical factors known in the art.
      <br/>
      Generally, systemic or injectable administration, such as intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (Sub-Q) injection, will be initiated at a dose which is minimally effective.
      <br/>
      The dose will then be gradually increased until a positive effect is observed.
      <br/>
      Incremental increases should be continued, so long as such increases produce a corresponding increase in effect, while taking into account any adverse affects that may appear.
      <br/>
      The addition of any other anti-TNF- ALPHA  agents to the final composition may also affect the final dosage.
      <br/>
      Progress may be monitored by analyzing the cytokine levels by the diagnostic assay previously described in the subject invention.
    </p>
    <p num="49">Anti-Cytokine Agents</p>
    <p num="50">
      Compounds which interfere with the production and/or activity of various cytokines, such as TNF- ALPHA , are widely known.
      <br/>
      The term "anti-cytokine compound" as used herein includes compounds which inhibit production, processing or activity of a cytokine or its receptor.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the term "anti-TNF- ALPHA  compound" as used herein includes compounds which inhibit production, processing or activity TNF- ALPHA  or its receptor(s).
      <br/>
      Such compounds may, for example, bind to the cytokine or its receptor, thereby preventing the natural cytokine-receptor interaction.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Many anti-TNF- ALPHA  compounds are known and/or are under development for treatment of other conditions associated with TNF- ALPHA , such as rheumatoid arthritis, insulin dependent diabetes, sepsis and Crohn's disease �see Haworth et al., "Cytokine and Anti-Cytokine Therapy", The Cytokine Handbook, Thomson, Angus, ed., pp. 777-801 (1998)�. Synthesis of TNF- ALPHA  can be inhibited by a variety of known agents, including phosphodiesterase inhibitors, prostanoids, adenosine, corticosteroids and IL-10.
      <br/>
      Glucocorticoids and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) also inhibit TNF synthesis.
      <br/>
      Processing of the TNF- ALPHA  pro-protein can be inhibited by specific inhibitors of the TNF- ALPHA  metalloprotease.
      <br/>
      The effects of released TNF- ALPHA  protein can be antagonized by TNF- ALPHA  antagonists, such as soluble TNF- ALPHA  receptors or anti-TNF- ALPHA  antibodies.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Anti-TNF- ALPHA  agents which can be used in the methods of the subject invention also include various cytokines, endogenous mediators, and synthetic drugs.
      <br/>
      Cytokines useful as anti-TNF- ALPHA  agents include, for example, IL-4, IL-10, TGF BETA , and ciliary neurotrophic factor.
    </p>
    <p num="53">Endogenous mediators which can be used as anti-TNF- ALPHA  agents include, for example, corticosteroids, prostanoids, adenosine, histamine, nitric oxide, retinoic acid, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>
    <p num="54">Synthetic drugs useful in the methods of the present invention as anti-TNF- ALPHA  agents include, for example, pentoxifylline, rodipram, cyclosporin A, chlorpromazine, thalidomide, antisense oligonucleotides, tetravalent guanylhydrazone (CNI-1493), and bicyclic imidazoles (SK&amp;F 86002).</p>
    <p num="55">Compounds which inhibit TNF processing include, for example, compound 2, and GI 129471.</p>
    <p num="56">Compounds which inhibit TNF- ALPHA  effects useful according to the present invention include, for example, anti-TNF- ALPHA  antibodies and soluble TNF receptors, and TNF receptor chimeras.</p>
    <p num="57">
      Inhibition of TNF synthesis can be achieved by several means: (1) inhibition of transcription; (2) decrease of the mRNA half-life; and (3) inhibition of translation.
      <br/>
      Phosphodiesterase inhibitors pentoxifylline act mainly on transcription.
      <br/>
      Dexamethasone inhibits translation.
      <br/>
      Thalidomide specifically decreases the half-life of TNF mRNA.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides allow specific suppression of TNF translation.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Phosphodiesterase inhibitors are also known to suppress TNF activity.
      <br/>
      Among the clinically used phosphodiesterase inhibitors, pentoxifylline has been the most extensively studied with regard to TNF-suppressing activity.
      <br/>
      Patients receiving anti-CD3 mAbs to treat acute graft rejection have been administered pentoxifylline to decrease harmful TNF synthesis.
      <br/>
      Rolipram, a specific type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is 500-fold more potent than pentoxifylline at suppressing TNF synthesis.
      <br/>
      Type IV phosphodiesterase is predominant in monocytes and is therefore an excellent target for suppression of cAMP-sensitive functions in this cell type.
      <br/>
      Moreover, rolipram synergizes with prostanoids (prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostacyclin analogs) both in elevating cAMP concentrations and in suppressing TNF synthesis.
      <br/>
      This may confer a tropism towards inflamed tissue with high interstitial concentrations of PGE2.
      <br/>
      Several animal studies show the efficacy of specific phosphodiesterase inhibition in vivo: in a rat model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), TNF suppression and amelioration by rolipram was confirmed for EAE in non-human primates (marmosets); and suppression of TNF synthesis and enhanced survival has been demonstrated following rolipram treatment in a rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
      <br/>
      Rolipram was first synthesized in the early 1980s.
      <br/>
      It has been tested in clinical trials as an antidepressant but has not been marketed.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      In a preferred aspect of the present invention, the anti-chemokine compound is etanercept, a dimeric fusion protein marketed under the name ENBREL.
      <br/>
      Etanercept consists of the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the human 75 kilodalton (p75) tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1.
      <br/>
      The Fc component of etanercept contains the CH2 domain, the CH3 domain and hinge region, but not the CH1 domain of IgG1.
      <br/>
      Etanercept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian cell expression system.
      <br/>
      Etanercept consists of 934 amino acids and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons.
      <br/>
      Etanercept is preferably supplied as a sterile, white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder for parenteral administration after reconstitution with 1 mL of the supplied Sterile Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (containing 0.9% benzyl alcohol).
      <br/>
      Following reconstitution, the solution of etanercept is preferably clear and colorless, with a pH of 7.4.+- 0 (slashed zero) 3.
      <br/>
      Each single-use vial of etanercept preferably contains 25 mg etanercept, 40 mg mannitol, 10 mg sucrose, and 1.2 mg tromethamine.

    <p num="65">Seminal Plasma Used as Principal Source of Antigen</p>
    <p num="66">
      Normal seminal plasma was used as the principal source of antigen.
      <br/>
      This material was obtained from pooled normal semen donors examined in the University of Maryland Andrology/In Vitro Fertilization laboratory.
      <br/>
      Semen was used for these studies if the semen analysis showed normal sperm count, motility, volume, pH and liquefaction and no leukospermia.
      <br/>
      Semen from normal donors was allowed to liquefy by incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature and centrifuged to remove spermatozoa.
      <br/>
      The supernatant was diluted in PBS and filter sterilized through a 0.2  MU m filter and cryopreserved at 70 (degree)  C. in aliquots.
      <br/>
      Several specimens were pooled and frozen in aliquots to allow for multiple experiments.
      <br/>
      Seminal plasma preparations were tested for endotoxin by the Limulus amebocyte lysis (LAL) assay.
      <br/>
      It was ensured that endotoxin levels in semen were low and standardized between lots of pooled seminal plasma.
      <br/>
      Control antigens were tetanus toxoid and candida extract.
    </p>
    <p num="67">CD4+ Proliferation Assay</p>
    <p num="68">
      Recall antigen proliferation assays were performed on CD4+ T lymphocytes from the PBMC of all subjects enrolled in the protocol as described previously �Cohen et al., J. Immunother. 14:242-252 (1993)�. Complete medium (CM) consists of RPMI-1640 containing 10% pooled human serum plus penicillin/streptomycin.
      <br/>
      PBMC was produced from leukopheresis packs by centrifugation over Lymphocyte Separation Medium.
      <br/>
      Aliquots of PBMC were cryopreserved in 10% DMSO in human serum avoiding exposure to potential bovine antigens in fetal bovine serum.
      <br/>
      Human serum from males may contain prostatic antigens, such as PSA.
      <br/>
      However, PSA is present in normal male serum in low amounts and all comparisons of reactivity to antigen are made to unpulsed antigen presenting cells cultured in the same medium alone.
      <br/>
      Hence any effect of traces of prostate antigens in human serum cannot explain differences between pulsed and unpulsed groups.
      <br/>
      PBMC was enriched for CD4+ T cells by immunoaffinity column chromatography by negative selection (R &amp; D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.).
      <br/>
      This was the responding population.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The stimulator cells consisted of autologous whole PBMC pulsed with various dilutions of pooled human seminal plasma, salt cut proteins, purified prostatic proteins or control antigens in CM for 18 hours.

      Antigens were added to 3 * 106 PBMC/well in 24 well plates containing 2 ml CM/well.
      <br/>
      Dilutions of seminal plasma and control antigens from 1:50 to 1:500 were used to determine antigen dose.
      <br/>
      Pulsed APC was washed, irradiated (3000 cGy, 137 Cs source) and mixed with the responder population in triplicate in 96 well plates at various stimulator:responder ratios.
      <br/>
      APC alone and T cells alone were set up as controls.
      <br/>
      Other wells received PHA 1  MU g/mI or PHA plus unpulsed PBMC to ensure that the responder population can proliferate.
      <br/>
      The plates were incubated for 5 days at 37 (degree)  C. and 3 H-thymidine 1  MU Ci/well was added for the last 18 hours of the incubation.
      <br/>
      The cells were then harvested onto filtermats and the incorporated counts per minute (CPM) in the cells determined by liquid scintillation counting with the BetaPlate instrument (Wallac, Gaithersburg, Md.).
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Data were analyzed by determining the mean of triplicate wells.
      <br/>
      CPM from stimulator PBMC alone was subtracted.
      <br/>
      A patient was considered a responder to seminal plasma if the mean CPM obtained from seminal plasma-pulsed APC exceeds the mean plus 3 standard deviations of the CPM obtained from unpulsed APC.
      <br/>
      Differences between the response of subjects within a group (prostatitis, normal volunteer) to recall and seminal plasma antigens was evaluated by the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test.
      <br/>
      This is a non-parametric test appropriate for a response which is not normally distributed as our preliminary data show for the response to seminal plasma.
      <br/>
      Differences in the overall mean CPM response to the antigens compared between groups (prostatitis versus normal, for example) was performed by the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.
      <br/>
      A 2 tailed p value of less than 0.05 was interpreted as excluding the null hypothesis for each comparison.
