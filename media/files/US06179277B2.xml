      The present invention provides for improved liquid vaporizer systems and methods for their use.
      <br/>
      Vaporizer systems of the present invention are likely to be particularly useful for the vaporization of liquids having a relatively low vapor pressure, such as TDMAT.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, a liquid vaporizer system (10) includes a vaporizer unit (16) having first and second inlets (50 and 60) and an outlet (62).
      <br/>
      The vaporizer system further includes a vessel (22) having an inlet (70) and an outlet (72), whereby the vessel inlet is operably connected to the vaporizer outlet.
      <br/>
      The vessel contains a plurality of passages (78) which operably connect the vessel inlet and the vessel outlet.
      <br/>
      In this manner, liquids and/or gases flowing into the vaporizer unit through either or both of its two inlets, exit the vaporizer unit outlet and enter the vessel inlet.
      <br/>
      Liquids and/or gases pass through the plurality of passages and exit the vessel outlet.
      <br/>
      In this manner, heating vaporizer unit and vessel to desired temperatures results in the vaporization of the liquid, such as liquid TDMAT.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention is directed to liquid vaporizer systems and, more specifically, to liquid vaporizer systems for low vapor pressure liquids.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Semiconductor fabrication processes may include the use of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to deposit a thin film of material on semiconductor wafers.
      <br/>
      CVD processes are often preferred because of their ability to provide highly uniform layers of film.
      <br/>
      CVD typically comprises introducing gases into a reaction chamber in the presence of a substrate, wherein the gases react and deposit a film on the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      Some of the CVD materials originate as liquids, and are evaporated and transported in the gaseous state to the desired reaction chamber for CVD.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Liquid reactant sources are often used with CVD processes.
      <br/>
      For example, titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) is used as a reactant gas in CVD to deposit titanium-containing film layers onto a substrate surface.
      <br/>
      Tetrakisdimethyl-amidotitanium (TDMAT), a metal-organic material, also is used in CVD processes.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      CVD using TiCl4 and TDMAT typically involves the vaporization of liquid TiCl4 or TDMAT and the transportation of the gaseous TiCl4 or TDMAT to the reaction chamber using a carrier gas.
      <br/>
      Care must be exercised to fully vaporize the liquid compound.
      <br/>
      If the compound is not fully vaporized and is thus delivered to the reaction chamber as a gas/liquid mixture, liquid compounds in the reaction chamber can lead to poor uniformity of the deposited film and other undesired process results.
      <br/>
      This also can cause poor repeatability wafer to wafer because liquid droplets deposited on the walls of the process piping can later evaporate, causing fluctuations in vapor concentration in the reaction chamber.
      <br/>
      Once fully vaporized, care also must be exercised to maintain the compound in a gaseous state while it is being transported to the reaction chamber.
      <br/>
      Condensation of TiCl4 or TDMAT can lead to undesirable deposition process variability and possibly the failure of line components.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The vaporization of TDMAT presents unique problems, in part due to the fact that TDMAT has a low vapor pressure.
      <br/>
      It is desirable, therefore, to provide an efficient mechanism for fully vaporizing TDMAT metal-organic compound, and for transporting the gaseous compound to the reaction chamber while avoiding the condensation of TDMAT liquid out of the gas.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention provides for improved liquid vaporizer systems and methods for their use.
      <br/>
      Vaporizer systems of the present invention are likely to be particularly useful for the vaporization of TDMAT and other liquid sources having relatively low vapor pressures.
      <br/>
      The present invention uses a two-step vaporization process to assist in the full vaporization of such liquids.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In one embodiment, a liquid vaporizer system of the present invention includes a vaporizer unit having first and second inlets and an outlet.
      <br/>
      The vaporizer system further includes a vessel having an inlet and an outlet, whereby the vessel inlet is operably connected to the vaporizer unit outlet.
      <br/>
      The vessel contains a plurality of passages which operably connect the vessel inlet with the vessel outlet.
      <br/>
      In this manner, liquids and/or gases flowing into the vaporizer unit through either or both of its two inlets exit the vaporizer unit outlet and enter the vessel inlet.
      <br/>
      Liquids and/or gases pass through the plurality of passages and exit the vessel outlet.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In one aspect, the first vaporizer inlet is adapted to receive a liquid and the second vaporizer inlet is adapted to receive a carrier gas.
      <br/>
      The vaporizer unit preferably comprises a control valve for controlling the amount of liquid passing therethrough, and a vaporization valve for causing the liquid which has passed through the control valve to be at least partially vaporized and transported out the vaporizer outlet by the carrier gas.
      <br/>
      A vaporizer passageway is provided which connects the control valve with the vaporization valve to allow liquid to flow from the control valve into the vaporization valve.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The vaporizer unit further preferably comprises a temperature-controlled housing structure containing both the control valve and the vaporization valve.
      <br/>
      A temperature control mechanism is in communication with the housing structure for maintaining a thermostatic condition inside the housing structure.
      <br/>
      In this manner, a desired amount of heat can be transmitted to the liquids or gases passing through the control valve and vaporization valve, thereby assisting with the vaporization of the liquid.
      <br/>
      Exemplary vaporizer units of the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,440,887 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,880, the complete disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

    <p num="14">
      In another aspect, the liquid vaporizer system further includes a preheater operably connected to at least one of the vaporizer inlets.
      <br/>
      Such a preheater is preferably used for preheating a carrier gas before the carrier gas enters the vaporizer unit.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the heated carrier gas facilitates the vaporization of a desired liquid, such as liquid TDMAT.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="22">
      A liquid vaporizer system 10 according to the present invention will now be described.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 depicts a schematic of liquid vaporizer system 10.
      <br/>
      Vaporizer system 10 includes a carrier gas line 12 through which a carrier gas such as helium, nitrogen, or the like is transported.
      <br/>
      For the vaporization of liquid TDMAT, the carrier gas is preferably a combination of inert gases, such as helium and nitrogen.
      <br/>
      Thus, the term carrier gas shall be understood to refer to an inert gas or a combination of inert gases.
      <br/>
      The desired carrier gas flows through a mass flow controller 11, which operates to control the amount of carrier gas flowing therethrough.
      <br/>
      The carrier gas is preheated in a preheater 14 and continues through carrier gas line 12 into a vaporizer unit 16.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A desired liquid, such as liquid TDMAT, flows through a liquid source line 13 and into and through a liquid flow meter 15.
      <br/>
      Liquid flow meter 15 operates to measure the amount of liquid flowing therethrough.
      <br/>
      The desired liquid enters a liquid line 18 and is delivered to vaporizer unit 16.
      <br/>
      Vaporizer unit 16, whose details will be described in conjunction with latter figures, at least partially vaporizes the TDMAT.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      A liquid/gas mixture of TDMAT and the carrier gas exits vaporizer unit 16 through a liquid/gas mixture line 20 and enters a vessel 22 in which further vaporization of the TDMAT occurs as described in conjunction with latter figures.
      <br/>
      A product gas comprising gaseous TDMAT exits vessel 22 and proceeds through a product gas line 24 to a reaction chamber 26.
      <br/>
      Chemical vapor deposition or other desired processes involving gaseous TDMAT can then occur in reaction chamber 26.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Carrier gas line 12, liquid source line 13 and liquid line 18 may comprise stainless steel tubing or the like.
      <br/>
      Similarly, liquid gas mixture line 20 and product gas line 24 may comprise stainless steel tubing or the like.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, lines 12, 13, 20 and 24 comprise 1/4 inch diameter tubing, and line 18 comprises 1/8 inch diameter tubing.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The present invention further anticipates operably attaching preheater 14 to vaporizer unit 16 without the need to have carrier gas line 12 therebetween.
      <br/>
      Such a connection may be accomplished by fittings and joints, such as face sealed tubing or the like.
      <br/>
      Likewise, vaporizer unit 16 and vessel 22 may be operably attached to one another without the need to use liquid/gas mixture line 20.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Turning now to FIG. 2, a preferred vaporizer unit 16 will be described.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, vaporizer unit 16 comprises a liquid inlet 50 for receiving a desired liquid such as TDMAT.
      <br/>
      Liquid line 18 is operably connected to liquid inlet 50 to allow the transportation of liquid TDMAT to vaporizer unit 16.
      <br/>
      A control valve 52 operates to control the amount of liquid TDMAT passing therethrough.
      <br/>
      Liquid TDMAT proceeds through a vaporizer passageway 56 and into a vaporization valve 54.
      <br/>
      As best seen in FIG. 3, vaporizer unit 16 further includes a carrier gas inlet 60 as shown here operably attached to carrier gas line 12.
      <br/>
      As the carrier gas enters vaporizer unit 16, it proceeds into and through vaporization valve 54.
      <br/>
      The carrier gas transports at least partially vaporized TDMAT through vaporization valve 54 and a liquid/gas TDMAT mixture exits a vaporizer unit outlet 62.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIGS. 2 and 3 depict a temperature-controlled housing structure 58 enclosing control valve 52 and vaporization valve 54.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 4, a temperature control mechanism or heater controller 64 is operably attached to housing structure 58 to maintain a thermostatic condition inside housing structure 58.
      <br/>
      By controlling the temperature within housing structure 58, preferably at an elevated temperature between about 50 degrees Celsius and about 200 degrees Celsius, and more preferably, between about 70 degrees Celsius and about 90 degrees Celsius, TDMAT can be at least partially vaporized.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, TDMAT is at least partially vaporized by its contact with the carrier gas.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The preceding discussion in conjunction with FIGS. 2-4 describes a preferred embodiment of vaporizer unit 16 according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      A more detailed description is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,440,887 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,880, the complete disclosures of which have been previously incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The preferred vaporizer unit 16 has experienced considerable success in vaporizing tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, having a vapor pressure of about 82 Torr at 100 degrees celsius), and other materials.
      <br/>
      However, due in part to the fact that TDMAT has a low vapor pressure (about 9.1 Torr at 100 degrees Celsius), vaporizer unit 16 typically only partially vaporizes TDMAT.
      <br/>
      As previously described, the presence of partially vaporized TDMAT can provide undesirable characteristics in chemical vapor deposition processes.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In an attempt to fully vaporize TDMAT, consideration was given to heating liquid/gas mixture line 20 to a temperature sufficient to complete the vaporization of TDMAT.
      <br/>
      However, for mixture line 20 comprising a 1/4 inch diameter tubing, this required heating the outer surface of such tubing to at least 115 degrees Celsius.
      <br/>
      At such a temperature, TDMAT breaks down into undesirable by-products which negatively affect the chemical vapor deposition process conducted in the reaction chamber.
      <br/>
      In addition, gas at this temperature may cause cracking of fittings, injection valves, and other line components.
      <br/>
      Therefore, at least part of the present invention is the realization that to provide full vaporization of TDMAT without increasing liquid/gas mixture line 20 temperature, and hence TDMAT temperature, to an undesirable level, TDMAT should be exposed to a larger heating surface at a lower temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Referring now to FIG. 5, a preferred vessel 22 of liquid vaporizer system 10 will now be described.
      <br/>
      Vessel 22 comprises inlet and outlet end caps 74 operably attached to a middle portion 76.
      <br/>
      The combination of end caps 74 and middle portion 76 results in vessel 22 having a cylindrical shape.
      <br/>
      Liquid/gas mixture line 20 is operably attached to vessel 22 in a manner which allows a liquid/gaseous TDMAT mixture to enter vessel 22.
      <br/>
      Product gas line 24 in turn is operably attached to vessel 22 to allow a product gas to exit vessel 22.
      <br/>
      Lines 20 and 24 can be operably attached to vessel 22 by a number of methods, including by the use of face sealed tubing or the like.
      <br/>
      As previously noted, vessel 22 also may be operably attached to vaporizer unit 16 without the need to use mixture line 20 therebetween.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Vessel 22 preferably comprises a thermally conductive material, and more preferably, stainless steel and/or aluminum.
      <br/>
      The choice of such a metal provides desirable thermal conductive properties to allow an external heat source to heat vessel 22 to a desired temperature.
      <br/>
      Vessel 22 may also comprise other thermally conductive materials, including other metals or metal alloys.
      <br/>
      Vessel 22 preferably comprises a disk-shaped or cylindrical vessel 22, although other shaped vessels are possible within the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, vessel 22 preferably has a diameter that is between about one inch and about three inches, and a height that is between about one half inch and about two inches.
      <br/>
      Such a size and shape facilitates the incorporation of vessel 22 into exemplary mainframe units currently commercially available, including the Precision 5000.RTM., the Centura.RTM. 5200, and the Endura.RTM. 5500 systems from Applied Materials, Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      FIGS. 6a-6c show cross-sectional views of inlet and outlet end caps 74 and middle portion 76, taken through the middle thereof.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIGS. 6a and 6c, each end cap 74 has an outer cap rim 75 having a height that is greater than the height of the remainder of end cap 74.
      <br/>
      As a result, when end caps 74 are operably attached to middle portion 76, a small gap is created between an inner surface 77 of end caps 74 and the upper and lower surfaces of middle portion 76.
      <br/>
      Inlet end cap 74, to which liquid/gas mixture line 20 is operably attached, includes a vessel inlet 70 for receiving the liquid/gas mixture.
      <br/>
      Likewise, outlet end cap 74 is operably attached to product gas line 24 and has a vessel outlet 72 to allow a product gas to exit vessel 22.
      <br/>
      End caps 74 may be affixed to middle portion 76 by welding, adhesive or the like.
      <br/>
      Further, end caps 74 and middle portion 76 may be formed as a single piece of thermally conductive material.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Middle portion 76 comprises an outer surface 80, a solid core 82 and a plurality of passages 78.
      <br/>
      Middle portion 76 may comprise a solid piece of thermally conductive material such as stainless steel, with passages 78 bored or drilled out therefrom.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, middle portion 76 may be formed or molded with passages 78, for example, by extruding a honeycomb-shaped structure to a desired length.
      <br/>
      As best seen in FIGS. 7a-7c, which depict top planar views of inlet and outlet end caps 74 and middle portion 76, a liquid/gas mixture entering vessel 22 enters vessel inlet 70.
      <br/>
      The liquid/gas mixture is unable to proceed directly through vessel 22 due to solid core 82.
      <br/>
      Instead, liquid/gas mixture proceeds through plurality of passages 78 and exits vessel 22 through vessel outlet 72.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      By providing a plurality of passages 78 through which the liquid/gas TDMAT mixture proceeds, the liquid/gas mixture is exposed to a surface area that is larger than an internal surface area of vessel 22 if vessel 22 were a hollow vessel without such passages 78.
      <br/>
      Vessel 22 with a plurality of passages 78, therefore, exposes the liquid/gas TDMAT mixture to a larger heated surface area and any liquid TDMAT remaining in the liquid/gas mixture can be further vaporized.
      <br/>
      As a result, vessel outlet 72 allows a product gas to exit vessel 22 which preferably comprises fully vaporized TDMAT.
      <br/>
      As depicted in FIG. 7b, one preferred embodiment has passages 78 having circular cross-sections, however, the shape of passages 78 can be varied within the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Further, the number of passages 78 may be larger or smaller than the number of passages 78 depicted in FIG. 7B.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In one preferred embodiment, vessel 22 is cylindrical in shape and has a diameter of two inches and a height equal to one inch.
      <br/>
      Two hundred and forty-six (246) passages 78 are provided, each having a diameter of 0.081 inch.
      <br/>
      The passages 78 allow liquid/gas mixtures passing therethrough to be exposed to a surface area that is over 100 times greater than the surface area such mixtures would be exposed to in a one inch long, 1/4 inch outer diameter (0.18 inch inner diameter) tubing.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      As seen in FIG. 8, a vessel heat source 84 preferably is operably attached to the outer surface of vessel 22.
      <br/>
      In this manner, vessel 22 outer surface preferably is heated to between about 50 degrees Celsius and about 200 degrees Celsius to assist with the vaporization of liquids.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 depicts vessel heat source 84 as a blanket heater, however, other heat sources may be used.
      <br/>
      As previously noted, passing a liquid/gas mixture of TDMAT through the one quarter (1/4) inch diameter tubing required that the outer surface of such tubing be heated to at least 115 degrees Celsius in order to fully vaporize the remaining liquid TDMAT.
      <br/>
      Use of vessel 22 having a larger surface area exposed to the liquid TDMAT allows vessel 22 to be heated to a lower temperature than the one quarter inch diameter tubing.
      <br/>
      For vaporization of TDMAT in the present invention, the outer surface of vessel 22 preferably is heated to between about 80 degrees Celsius and about 100 degrees Celsius, and more preferably, to about 95 degrees Celsius.
      <br/>
      By reducing vessel 22 temperature to about 95 degrees Celsius, TDMAT is no longer broken down into undesirable byproducts.
      <br/>
      As a result, a more homogeneous gaseous TDMAT is produced, thereby resulting in more favorable chemical vapor deposition processes.
      <br/>
      In addition, the lower temperature reduces the likelihood of cracking or other damage to line components.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Turning now to FIG. 9 a gas passageway as part of the liquid vaporizer system 10 will be described.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9 depicts product gas line 24 surrounded by an electric resistance heater 90.
      <br/>
      Electric resistance heater 90 may comprise a blanket heater, although other heat sources may be used.
      <br/>
      Heater 90 is used to heat product gas line 24 to a desired temperature and to insulate line 24 in order to prevent the condensation of liquids, such as liquid TDMAT, on the internal surface of product gas line 24.
      <br/>
      Product gas line 24 preferably is heated to between about 50 degrees Celsius and about 200 degrees Celsius.
      <br/>
      As previously noted, the presence of liquid TDMAT is undesirable in chemical deposition processes and, therefore, the use of a heated insulated, product gas line 24 is desirable.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      As previously discussed in conjunction with FIG. 1, carrier gas line 12 may preferably pass through a preheater 14.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 10a and 10b, preheater 14 can comprise heating elements 15 operably attached to the outer surface of carrier gas line 12.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the outer surface of carrier gas line 12 is heated, preferably to between about 50 degrees Celsius and about 200 degrees Celsius.
      <br/>
      As a result, carrier gas passing through carrier gas line 12 is at least partially heated.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, vessel 22 may be used as preheater 14.
      <br/>
      In this manner, carrier gas line 12 delivers a carrier gas to vessel 22, which heats the carrier gas passing therethrough as previously described.
      <br/>
      Carrier gas then flows into vaporizer unit 16 and a second vessel 22, which operate as previously described to vaporize a desired liquid, such as TDMAT.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Referring to FIG. 1, a method of vaporizing liquid/gas mixtures will now be described.
      <br/>
      A carrier gas, such as helium and/or nitrogen, is introduced into vaporizer unit 16, preferably after passing through mass flow controller 11 and preheater 14.
      <br/>
      A liquid, preferably liquid TDMAT, is introduced into vaporizer unit 16, preferably after passing through liquid flow meter 15.
      <br/>
      The liquid is at least partially vaporized in vaporizer unit 16 to create a liquid/gas mixture.
      <br/>
      The liquid/gas mixture is then passed through heated vessel 22, wherein the liquid/gas mixture is further vaporized into a product gas.
      <br/>
      Such further vaporization in heated vessel 22 is accomplished by passing the liquid/gas mixture through a plurality of passages as previously described.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In one preferred embodiment, the liquid comprises TDMAT and the carrier gas comprises a combination of helium and nitrogen.
      <br/>
      Preheater 14 is heated to a desired temperature that preferably is between about 90 degrees Celsius and about 120 degrees Celsius, which in turn heats the carrier gas passing through carrier gas line 12.
      <br/>
      Vaporizer unit 16 is heated to a desired temperature that preferably is between about 70 degrees Celsius and about 90 degrees Celsius, and the carrier gas and liquid TDMAT pass therethrough.
      <br/>
      A liquid/gas TDMAT mixture exits vaporizer unit 16 and passes through vessel 22.
      <br/>
      Vessel 22's outer surface is heated to a desired temperature that preferably is between about 80 degrees Celsius and about 100 degrees Celsius, and more preferably, is about 95 degrees Celsius.
      <br/>
      The product gas exiting vessel 22 is transported to chamber 26 through heated, insulated passageway 24.
      <br/>
      Passageway 24 is heated to a desired temperature that preferably is between about 80 degrees Celsius and about 110 degrees Celsius.
      <br/>
      As a result, liquid TDMAT is fully vaporized by passing through vaporizing unit 16 and vessel 22 at the preferred temperatures, and is transported in heated passageway 24 to chamber 26 in the gaseous state.

    <p num="43">
      The invention has now been described in detail.
      <br/>
      However, it will be appreciated that certain changes and modifications may be made.
      <br/>
      For example, the present invention may be used with other liquids having a relatively low vapor pressure, such as triethylphosphate (TEPO) or liquids marketed under the trade name Cupra Select by Schumacher (a unit of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.), located in Carlsbad, Calif.
      <br/>
      It is further understood that the liquid vaporizer systems and methods of the present invention can facilitate vaporization of other liquids having vapor pressures higher than that of TDMAT, such as liquid TEOS or TiCl4.
