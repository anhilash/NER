      3-Isochromanome is prepared by reacting an o-xylene-alpha,alpha'-dihalide with carbon monoxide and water in the presence of a metal catalyst such that the pH of the reaction is maintained between about 7 and 11.

  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">This application is a 371 of PCT/GB98/01581 filed May 29, 1998, now WO 98/56784 Dec. 17, 1998.</p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a chemical process and more particularly to a process for preparing 3-isochromanone which is useful in the manufacture of certain agricultural products.</p>
    <p num="3">
      3-Isochromanone is a well known compound and a number of methods for its preparation are described in the chemical literature.
      <br/>
      In particular, a process is described in WO97/00850 which comprises reacting an o-xylene- ALPHA , ALPHA '-dihalide derivative with carbon monoxide and water in an organic solvent in the presence of a catalyst and a hydrogen halide capturing agent followed by treatment with an acid.
      <br/>
      It has now been found that the final acid treatment can be obviated by careful control of the pH during reaction, thereby providing a simpler process.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of 3-isochromanone which comprises reacting an o-xylene- ALPHA , ALPHA '-dihalide with carbon monoxide and water in the presence of a catalyst, characterised in that the pH of the reaction is maintained between 7 and 11.</p>
    <p num="5">The o-xylene- ALPHA , ALPHA '-dihalide starting material has the general formula:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="6">where X is a halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine or iodine, especially chlorine or bromine. o-Xylene- ALPHA , ALPHA '-dichloride is a particularly convenient starting material.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The pH of the reaction is maintained by having present at the beginning a sufficient amount of a suitable base, or by the controlled addition during the reaction of a suitable base at a suitable rate, or by buffering.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, it may be maintained by a combination of these methods.
      <br/>
      Suitable bases include inorganic bases such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carbonates, bicarbonates or hydroxides, for example, sodium or magnesium carbonate, potassium or sodium bicarbonate or calcium or magnesium hydroxide, or organic bases such as carboxylate salts, for example acetate salts.
      <br/>
      Quantities and rates of addition of the base should be sufficient to maintain the pH in the range of 7 to 11, suitably 7 to 10, for example, 8 to 10.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Conveniently the process is carried out in an organic solvent which is inert to the reactants.
      <br/>
      Any suitable organic solvent may be used, either water soluble or water immiscible.
      <br/>
      Examples are saturated or aromatic hydrocarbons or halogenated derivatives thereof, such as chlorinated or fluorinated derivatives, for example methylene chloride, toluene or chloro- or fluorobenzene, polar aprotic solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, ethers such as cyclic ethers, for example tetrahydrofuran, aliphatic ethers, for example dialkyl ethers, aromatic ethers, for example phenyl alkyl ethers and polyethers such as polyethylene glycols and variants thereof, for example, end-capped polyether glycols, alcohols such as t-butanol, nitrites, amines, ketones and esters.
      <br/>
      The choice of solvent may be influenced by the use to which the 3-isochromanone will be put.
      <br/>
      Of particular interest are C1-6 and especially C1-4 dialkyl ethers like methyl t-butyl ether and methyl t-amyl ether.
      <br/>
      It is envisaged, however, that the reaction may be carried out in water with no solvent present.

      One example of this is to carry out the process at a temperature above the melting point of the o-xylene- ALPHA , ALPHA '-dihalide, which, in the case of o-xylene- ALPHA , ALPHA '-dichloride is about 55 (degree)  C. As 3-isochromanone melts at 82 to 84 (degree)  C., a reaction temperature below this may be of advantage in allowing 3-isochromanone to crystallise out and allowing isolation of 3-isochromanone by filtration or extraction in a suitable solvent.

      The carbon monoxide will normally be added by feeding a continuous supply of the gas into the reaction mixture either at atmospheric pressure or at pressures up to 100 atmospheres, for example at from 1 to 5 atmospheres.

      When the process is carried out in a two-phase system, for example when a water-immiscible solvent is used, it may be advantageous to include a phase transfer catalyst.
      <br/>
      By the term "phase transfer catalyst" is meant a substance which, being at least partly present in or wetted by a first (usually organic) phase, promotes reaction between a reactant in the first phase and a reactant which it transfers to the first phase from a second (usually aqueous but sometimes solid) phase.
      <br/>
      After reaction, the phase transfer catalyst is released for transferring further reactant.
      <br/>
      Phase transfer catalysts are reviewed by E. V. Dehmlow in Angewante Chemie (International Edition), 13 (3), 170 (1974).
      <br/>
      Other reviews are by Jozef Dockx in Synthesis (1973), 441-456 and by C. M. Starks in JACS., (93) 1, Jan. 13, 1971, 195-199.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Suitably the phase transfer catalyst is a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salt preferably containing bulky organic groups, usually alkyl or aralkyl groups, to make it soluble in the organic phase.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the phase catalyst is a tetraalkyl or aralkyl (eg benzyl) trialkyl ammonium or phosphonium salt in which the total number of carbon atoms attached to each nitrogen or phosphorus atom is greater than 10.
      <br/>
      There is little advantage in the number being above 70.
      <br/>
      It is especially preferred that the number should be in the range of from 16 to 40.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Examples of quaternary ammonium salts are: cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, dicetyldimethylammonium chloride, octyltributylammonium bromide, trioctylmethylammonium chloride (available as Aliquat (tm)  336), benzyldimethyllaurylammonium chloride, benzyltriethylammonium chloride, dilauryldimethylammonium chloride, tetrabutylammonium bromide and dieicosyldimethylammonium chloride.
      <br/>
      Examples of quaternary phosphonium salts are cetyltripropylphosphonium bromide and triphenylethylphosphonium bromide.
      <br/>
      Other phase transfer catalysts which may be suitable include crown ethers and polyethylene glycol variants.
      <br/>
      If used, the phase transfer catalyst may be present in an amount ranging from 0.001 to 0.5 mole equivalents of the o-xylene- ALPHA , ALPHA '-dihalide.

      The latter is then discarded and the 3-isochromanone extracted from the organic layer by the addition of aqueous base to form a salt of the corresponding hydroxy acid.

      o-Xylene  ALPHA , ALPHA '-dichloride (5.0 g, 29 mmol), potassium bicarbonate (12.1 g, 121 mmol), Aliquat (tm)  336 (1.2 g, 3 mmol), recycled catalyst (from Example 13) and toluene (52.9 g, 574 mmol) were charged to a 100 ml three-necked round bottomed flask with stirring.
      <br/>
      A steady flow of carbon monoxide was bubbled through the reaction mixture whilst heating to 70 (degree)  C. Triphenylphosphine (186.5 mg, 0.7 mmol) was dissolved in approximately 3 ml of toluene, and once the reaction mixture had reached temperature, this solution was charged by syringe in suitable aliquots, over a 30 minute period.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was maintained at 70 (degree)  C., with carbon monoxide bubbling through and vigorously stirred for 13 hours, before sampling for qualitative gas chromatographic analysis.
      <br/>
      Results showed the ratio of 3-isochromanone to starting material to be 87:13 by area percent.
      <br/>
      After a further 3 hours under the reaction conditions, the qualitative gas chromatographic analysis showed the ratio of 3-isochromanone to starting material to be 95:5 by area percent.
      <br/>
      After an additional 4 hours under the reaction conditions, the qualitative gas chromatographic analysis showed the ratio of 3-isochromanone to starting material to be &gt;99:1.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and the carbon monoxide supply was stopped.
      <br/>
      The slurry was filtered through a GF/B Whatman filter (-3) and the clear amber toluene solution (25.69 g) analysed for isochromanone content.
      <br/>
      The remaining cake was washed with toluene (2 * 10 ml), and the washings (16.28 g) retained for analysis.
      <br/>
      The total quantitive yield of 3-isochromanone by gc analysis (including washings) was 54.8%. After further washing with water (20 ml) and hexane (20 ml) the black solid (recovered palladium on Montmorillonite catalyst) was dried by suction.

    <p num="54">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 15</p>
    <p num="55">
      This Example forms no part of the present invention and is included for comparative purposes only.
      <br/>
      It illustrates that when the pH of the carbonylation reaction mixture is allowed to rise to 12, no 3-isochromanone is formed without an acidification step.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Toluene (25 ml), dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (II), (0.1 g, 1.1 mol. %), triphenylphosphine (0.075 g, 2.3 mol %) and o-xylene- ALPHA , ALPHA '-dichloride (2.2 g. 1 eq) were charged to a 100 ml round bottomed flask which was degassed and filled 4 times with carbon monoxide.
      <br/>
      The temperature was raised to 70 (degree)  C. and potassium hydroxide as a 1.8% solution was added to maintain the pH of the reaction between 9 and 9.5. The pH steadied out at around 12 after approx. 0.15 eq of potassium hydroxide solution was charged.
      <br/>
      Qualitative gc analysis showed 93% starting material and no 3-isochromanone in the organic layer.
      <br/>
      The acidified aqueous layer showed 19.2% starting material and 6% 3-isochromanone.
