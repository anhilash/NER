    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to curable latex compositions, and, more specifically, to heat-gellable latex compositions that are stable in the absence of heat for a relatively long period of time.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Natural and synthetic rubbery cellular products have many applications.
      <br/>
      One significant use for such products is the application of a layer of foam to carpet backing to provide an integral cushion.
      <br/>
      Synthetic latex foam is now used widely in the textile industry.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      It is customary in compounding latex dispersions to add all the compounding ingredients except the activator prior to the foaming step.
      <br/>
      A commonly used activator is zinc oxide.
      <br/>
      However, if this procedure is followed, the zinc oxide present would induce premature coagulation during the foaming step.
      <br/>
      Therefore, zinc oxide is frequently added prior to the foaming step.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,969,289 discloses a one-part storable foamable latex composition.
      <br/>
      The composition comprises a natural or synthetic elastomeric latex that is subject to cure.
      <br/>
      A curing system is provided comprising an ammonia-retarded dibenzyl dithiocarbamate accelerating agent that is inhibited in accelerating function in the presence of a base, such as ammonia.
      <br/>
      The composition includes an amount of ammonia sufficient to inhibit the cure of the latex and a foaming agent.
      <br/>
      Most importantly, the composition includes a siloxane heat-sensitizing agent to lower the coagulation temperature of the latex to about 90 degrees F., or above.
      <br/>
      The latex composition disclosed in the '289 patent is disadvantageous because it requires the use of a specific heat sensitizing agent.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Thus, a one-part foamable latex composition that is stable against gellation for extended periods of time prior to or after foaming has long been sought in the art.</p>

    <p num="29">
      The latex, potassium oleate, antioxidant, phosphate dispersant inert filler, pigment, ammonia, zinc ammonium chloride and thickener are blended together in a Hobart mixer.
      <br/>
      The zinc oxide, sulfur, zinc dibenzyldithiocarbamate and Z(MBT) are blended together in a separate Hobart mixer.
      <br/>
      The two blends are then combined and thoroughly mixed in a Hobart mixer.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The resulting mixtures are stored in separate containers for a period of two months.
      <br/>
      The containers are opened and the contents are examined.
      <br/>
      There is no sign of coagulation of the latex in any of the formulations.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The resulting mixtures are also fed to an Oakes froth generator where they are converted to a froth having a density of approximately 4-40 pounds per cubic foot.
      <br/>
      The froth is then deposited from a traversing hose onto the backing of a carpet carried on a moving, continuous conveyor belt.
      <br/>
      The moving belt carries the carpet and the deposited froth under a doctor blade which doctors the deposited froth into a layer of approximately 0.062-0.500 inches in thickness.
      <br/>
      The belt carrying the carpet and the layer of frothed latex on the backing thereof passes into a forced hot air over at a temperature of approximately 130 (degree) -500 (degree)  F. The frothed layer of latex is heated for a period of approximately 15 seconds to 2 minutes.
      <br/>
      The heating of the frothed layer of latex is sufficient to volatilize enough of the ammonia from the latex composition so that gellation or coagulation of the latex composition occurs.
      <br/>
      The carpet and layer of frothed latex then passes under an embossing roller which embosses a waffle pattern on the gelled, but not cured, layer of frothed latex foam.
      <br/>
      The carpet and embossed layer of foam then passes through a second heated forced air oven where the layer of foam is heated at a temperature of approximately 180 (degree) -400 (degree)  F. for a period of approximately 1-12 minutes.
      <br/>
      When the carpet emerges from the second oven, the frothed foam is dried and cured or vulcanized and has an embossed pattern on its surface.
