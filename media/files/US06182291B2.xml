      The invention is a hunting vest that is comprised of a base fabric material.
      <br/>
      Flaps are provided on the front and on the back of the vest.
      <br/>
      The flaps have a camouflage color on one side, and a blaze orange color on the opposite side.
      <br/>
      The flaps are detachably attached to the vest so that either color is visible, dependent on the choice of the hunter.
      <br/>
      The front flap is designed to fold over pockets, designed to protect shotgun shells, in the front side of the vest.
      <br/>
      The vest can also be equipped with additional pockets and a game bag.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to clothing, and in particular to hunting clothing.
      <br/>
      More specifically, this invention relates to hunting vests that have colored reversible flaps on the front and back of the vest.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In order to remain concealed from animals while hunting, hunters typically wear camouflage clothing.
      <br/>
      However, there are times during the same hunting excursion that hunters wish to be visible while walking through the woods so that the hunter is visible to other hunters, such as when the hunter is walking through the hunting area.
      <br/>
      Presently, this requires the hunter to carry two different garments on their person while hunting.
      <br/>
      The first garment is the camouflage clothing while the second garment is some brightly colored garment to promote visibility.
      <br/>
      This invention provides for an improvement to common hunting vests in which the one vest can be modified without removing the vest to change its color.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Inventors have obtained patents on hunting vests that provide beneficial features.
      <br/>
      For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,796,304 (Shelby) provides for ventilated pockets composed of a netting material in front of a base fabric material.
      <br/>
      The ventilated pockets allow for air to ventilate food and other items that would otherwise become stale or soggy in non-ventilated pockets.
    </p>
    <p num="4">U.S. Pat. No. 3,885,248 (Salsby) includes a hunting vest that has an elongated back panel to prevent blood from a gutted carcass from splashing on the hunter during transportation of the carcass from the woods.</p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,337,101 (Tombari) discloses a hunting vest that has pockets on the outside for the storage of shells, cartridges, or other relatively heavy articles.
      <br/>
      These pockets allow for a hunter to readily and quickly retrieve the articles when needed.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      U.S. Pat. No. Des. 278,089 (Day) is a design patent for a reversible vest.
      <br/>
      This patent discloses a vest that can be turned inside out.
      <br/>
      The vest has pockets on one side of the vest only.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the user reverses the vest, the pockets become inaccessible by the wearer.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      These vests are limited in that none provide a hunting vest that can be modified in the woods by the hunter to change the color of the vest without removing the vest.
      <br/>
      Further, none of these vests allow for the hunter to change the color of the vest without disrupting the orientation of the pockets or the items carried in the pockets of the vest.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      There is a need for a hunting vest that is capable of being modified so that the color of the vest is changed without removing the vest from the person.
      <br/>
      There is a need for doing this modification quickly and easily by the hunter, while in the woods, without having to carry or store extra clothing on their person.
      <br/>
      There is also a further need for performing such modification without disrupting the orientation of items in pockets of the hunting vest.
      <br/>
      Additionally, yet another need exists for performing such modification so that pockets are still located on the outside of the vest, providing easy access for the hunter to the items inside.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">Accordingly, it is the general object of the instant invention to provide a vest that is capable of being modified so that the color of the vest is changed without removing the vest.</p>
    <p num="10">It is a further object of the instant invention to provide for a vest that overcomes the shortcomings of previous vests and improves upon existing vest options for hunters.</p>
    <p num="11">It is yet a further object of the instant invention to provide a vest that can have its color modified easily and quickly by the hunter, without the need of having to store or carry extra clothing or colored fabric.</p>
    <p num="12">
      It is still yet a further object of the instant invention to provide for such a vest which can be modified without having to remove the vest or turn the vest over or inside out.
      <br/>
      This object of the invention prevents items stored in the pockets of the vest from shifting or spilling when such modification occurs.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      It is still another object of the instant invention to provide a vest that can be modified so that the pockets of the vest remain on the outside of the vest.
      <br/>
      This object of the invention enables the hunter to always have easy access to items in the vest regardless of the color of the vest and prevents the hunter from having to switch items to different pockets.
    </p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The instant invention provides a vest which has colored reversible flaps on both the front and back of the vest.
      <br/>
      Both of the flaps have one side colored in camouflage while the other side is blaze orange in color.
      <br/>
      The blaze orange color is used in the subject invention to allow the hunter wearing the subject invention to be visible to other hunters.
      <br/>
      It should be readily appreciated that any bright color can be used in place of the blaze orange, although blaze orange is the color typically used by hunters.
      <br/>
      When the hunter wishes to change the color of the front side of the vest, the first flap is simply removed and flipped around to reveal the backside of the flap.
      <br/>
      This backside will be camouflage or blaze orange, depending on which side the hunter currently had visible.
      <br/>
      The hunter will now attach the front flap to the front side of the vest so that the new color is displayed.
      <br/>
      This modification is quick and easy.
      <br/>
      It does not require removal of the vest or storage of an item which accomplishes the same task as the colored flap.
      <br/>
      Further, if any items are located in the vest or on it, they are not disrupted during this modification.
      <br/>
      This is because only the flap, and not the vest, is removed and rotated.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The color of the back side of the vest is changed in a similar fashion.
      <br/>
      The second flap is attached to the back side of the vest.
      <br/>
      When the hunter wishes to change the color of the back of the vest, the hunter removes the second flap, flips the flap around, and attaches the second flap to the back of the vest.
      <br/>
      The hunter accomplishes this modification in the same way as the modification of the color of the front side of the vest.
