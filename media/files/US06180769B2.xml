    <p num="6">
      Strongly negatively charged biological macromolecules such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA) and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) play a crucial part in cell functioning.
      <br/>
      In principal strongly negatively charged implies at least 1 negative charge per pentasaccharide of the biomolecule in so far as this is composed of pentasaccharides.
      <br/>
      DNA and RNA contain 1 negative charge per nucleotide.
      <br/>
      Glycosaminoglycans are heterogenous in this respect and can contain 1 to 4 negative charges per disaccharide.
      <br/>
      Compounds with such charge structure can be applied in the invention from which proteins, polypeptides, oligopeptides and peptides, the so-called proteinaceous molecules, are excluded.
      <br/>
      It is generally known that such proteinaceous molecules can coat polystyrene in physiological salt solutions (for example 0.15 M NaCl) however for non-proteinaceous molecules until now preferably spacer molecules have been applied.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      DNA encodes all proteins, RNA is an intermediate in protein synthesis and glycosaminoglycans (such as heparin) play a part during fundamental processes such as growth, differentiation and blood coagulation.
      <br/>
      By development of molecular biological techniques nucleic acids have begun to play an increasingly large part in analysis of biological material.
      <br/>
      Fragments of DNA that are specific for example for causative organisms of disease (bacteria, viruses etc.) can be used for detection of these organisms and diagnosis of hereditary diseases also occurs at DNA level.
      <br/>
      Besides the strongly developing diagnostic importance of DNA/RNA, nucleic acids are also often applied for synthesis (also at industrial level) of specific proteins via so-called recombinant DNA techniques.
      <br/>
      Antibodies directed against nucleic acids play a part in diseases of connective tissue and autoimmune diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosis.
      <br/>
      From this it is clear that good analysis possibilities of in particular DNA and RNA are of crucial importance.
      <br/>
      Microtitre plates are often used for analysis of a large number of samples.
      <br/>
      In diagnostic routine assays microbeads, tubes and strips are also used a lot.
      <br/>
      Microtitre plates are plastic plates (usually of polystyrene) which contain 96 wells in which the sample is analysed.
      <br/>
      A known example of use of such plates is for ELISA's (Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assays).
      <br/>
      A large disadvantage of these plates is that for assays wherein biological micromolecules with a strong negative charge have to be immobilized, such molecules hardly bind to the plastic plates.
      <br/>
      Immobilized macromolecule is however required for many tests.
      <br/>
      At the moment spacer molecules are used to bind negatively charged molecules to plastic.
      <br/>
      The spacer molecules bind both to the plastic and the macromolecule.
      <br/>
      Examples of such spacer molecules are protamin and polylysine, which are both positively charged proteins.
      <br/>
      Another option is the modification of DNA/RNA via biotinylation whereby it binds to avidin which can be bound in turn to plastic.
      <br/>
      Both methods require additional steps, are costly and also sensitive to disturbances.
      <br/>
      Such a disturbance is the provision of false positive results which cannot be acceptable in particular for diagnostic tests.

      <br/>
      In this procedure Yamaoka et al first dialyse the nucleic acid against the salt with which linkage is to occur.
      <br/>
      The purpose hereof is to charge the nucleic acid with the relevant ions.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated instance of page 520 replacement of monovalent Na+ by divalent Ca2+ occurs.
      <br/>
      In addition the polystyrene has to be dialysed against the relevant salt containing liquid (page 520) and thus needs pretreatment prior to linkage to the macromolecule being possible.
      <br/>
      The highest concentration of salt solution applied by Yamaoka is 0.01M and this is a concentration at which the amount of DNA more or less reaches a maximum.
      <br/>
      On page 523 it is further reported the Na-salt of DNA can hardly be linked.
      <br/>
      Yamaoka et al believe that binding of divalent anions that bind on one hand to negative groups on DNA and on the other hand to negative groups in the polystyrene is responsible for the linkage of DNA to the matrix.
      <br/>
      The divalent cation is to be regarded as a spacer molecule (page 519).
      <br/>
      The removal of the divalent cation for example with EDTA results in desorption of DNA from the matrix.
      <br/>
      The linked DNA produced by Yamaoka et al can easily be removed from the latex (p522).
      <br/>
      Obviously the DNA binding achieved with the method described by Yamaoka et al results in such weak linkage of the DNA to polystyrene that no applications with extreme circumstances such as used in hybridisation assays are possible.

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The subject invention is capable of providing such linkage.
      <br/>
      The subject invention comprises a cheap, simple, efficient and reliable method to directly bind strongly negatively charged nucleic acid or glycosaminoglycan macrobiomolecules to plastic carriers such as polystyrene, polyethylene, latex, polyvinylidene difluoride or polycarbonate.
      <br/>
      These plastics need not be subjected to chemical activation or modification and can thus be applied as such which offers an appreciable advantage over the existing methods.
      <br/>
      The subject method for preparing the macrobiomolecules of the invention with strong negative charge linked to plastic is characterized in that the macrobiomolecules and plastic are contacted with each other in the presence of a non chaotropic solution capable of removing the water coat of the molecule and/or shielding the negatively charged groups of the macrobiomolecule such that direct linkage occurs between molecules and plastic i.e. without a spacer molecule and without requiring an activation step of the plastic.
      <br/>
      The linkage step is followed by removal of the solution.
      <br/>
      The conditions of the solution used depend on the applications.
      <br/>
      The method can be carried out by applying a solution with 20-100% salt saturation which provides direct linkage between molecules and plastic.
      <br/>
      Preferably a solution with a degree of saturation of more than 50% is applied, with more preference for a degree of saturation of more than 60%.
      <br/>
      The optimal results are obtained with a solution with a degree of saturation between 70-100%.
      <br/>
      The suspected mechanism of operation is as follows.
      <br/>
      The salt removes the water coat around the negatively charged molecules and shields the negative charges such that the interaction with plastic, for example polystyrene is strongly improved.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Preferably a non chaotropic salt belonging to the Hofmeister series of salts is used for the solution according to the subject invention.
      <br/>
      A non chaotropic salt of a metal from group I or II of the Periodic Table of Elements or a NH+4 salt are examples of effective salts.
      <br/>
      A solution which comprises at least a salt with an anion from the group of halogens comprising chloride and bromide, or the group phosphate, sulphate and acetate is also preferred.
      <br/>
      Of the halogens chloride is preferred.
      <br/>
      Salts that are very useful in a method according to the subject invention are NaCl, KCl, LiCl, MgCl2, MgSO4, (NH4)2 SO4, NaH2 PO4 and Ca(AC)2. A person skilled in the art will realise what salts are to be considered chaotropic and non chaotropic.
      <br/>
      In particular the ions in the Hofmeister series that tend to denature proteins I-, ClO4-, SCN-, Li+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and Ba2+ are said to be chaotropic.
      <br/>
      This list also includes the guadinium ion and nonionic urea.
      <br/>
      Generally speaking salts capable of salting out proteins are non chaotropic and salts that tend to denature proteins are chaotropic.
      <br/>
      The most chaotropic substances are salts resulting as a combination of ions from the right of the Hofmeister series and the most non chaotropic substances are combinations of ions from the left of the Hofmeister series.
      <br/>
      Combinations of any of SO42-, H2 PO4-, CH3 COO- and Cl- with any of NH430 , K+, Cs+, Na+ are non chaotropic salts.
      <br/>
      In general chaotropic agents increase the solubility of nonpolar substances in water.
      <br/>
      Any agent capable of illustrating the increase in solubility of a non-polar substance in water to the same degree as salts from the left of the Hofmeister series as mentioned above can be considered suitable for carrying out the invention if they do not denature the macrobiomolecule.
      <br/>
      LiCl is an example of a suitable salt.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In particular (NH4)2 SO4 is superior as a non chaotropic salt in the process according to the invention because only low amounts of the compound to be bound are required for optimal binding.
      <br/>
      In general the method according to the subject invention will be carried out with a salt capable of salting out proteins.
      <br/>
      The pH is not critical for the method when salt is applied.
      <br/>
      The correct circumstances will vary per biomolecule and a person skilled in the art will know for biomolecules such as RNA, DNA which pH and which salt concentrations are applicable.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The method according to the invention can also be carried out by using a solution of the macrobiomolecule with a lower pH than the pKa of the charged groups of the macrobiomolecule to be linked whereby direct linkage occurs between the molecule and the plastic without a spacer molecule.
      <br/>
      By selection of an extremely low pH, for example pH 0 (i.e. 1 M HCl) negative groups (phosphate groups in DNA/RNA, sulphate groups in GAG) will become neutral whereby linkage will be strongly simplified.
      <br/>
      If the method is carried out at a very low pH this will mean in general that the pH is lower than 2.
      <br/>
      Of course a combination of the two above-mentioned embodiments (variation of salt concentration and pH) of the method is possible.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The method according to the subject invention can be carried out in the various embodiments mentioned above at a temperature between 0-100 (degree)  C., preferably between 2-90 (degree)  C. Good results are achieved at both 4 (degree)  C. and 80 (degree)  C. The higher the temperature the quicker the coating will proceed.
      <br/>
      At 80 (degree)  C. very efficient coating can be achieved.
      <br/>
      The temperature to be used will not only depend on the period of time in which coating is required but will possibly be dependent on the type of molecule with which the coating is carried out.
      <br/>
      Double stranded DNA will denature at higher temperatures which can be undesirable.
      <br/>
      The method according to the subject invention can be carried out with a linkage step lasting at least 5 to 10 minutes, for example 10 minutes at a temperature of 80 (degree)  C. The method according to the invention can also be carried out overnight at 4 (degree)  C. with good results or for 1 hour at 80 (degree)  C. with very good results.
      <br/>
      The period of time is also dependent on the time required for any steps optionally to be carried out after the coating for example with antibodies and detection reagents.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The method according to the subject invention preferably comprises one or more steps after the linkage step for removing the linkage solution.
      <br/>
      The linked product can be rinsed with water to achieve this.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to apply salt solution buffered with Tris with Tween.RTM. 20 for example 0.1% Tween.RTM.. In general one will rinse with a product that is not detrimental to the linked biomacromolecule.
      <br/>
      In practice rinsing with at least two rinsing steps with water and once with salt solution buffered with Tris with 0.1% Tween.RTM. suffices well.
      <br/>
      A person skilled in the art will understand which solutions can be applied.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      For hybridisation research double stranded DNA can be linked using the method according to the subject invention.
      <br/>
      The method for linkage of double stranded DNA to plastic according to the invention proceeds best in a saturated salt solution in water.
      <br/>
      A solution of NaCl is excellent.
      <br/>
      A saturated solution of NaCl contains approximately 5 M NaCl, depending on the temperature of the solution.
      <br/>
      Good results can be achieved for the linkage step with incubation overnight at 4 (degree)  C. After the linkage the DNA can subsequently be rendered single stranded thereby becoming suitable for hybridisations.
      <br/>
      After rinsing the linked double stranded DNA can be rendered single stranded by addition of 0.2 M NaOH/0.2 mM EDTA for 5 minutes at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The linked nucleic acid is attached in such a manner to the plastic that it will not be released during the usual steps required for hybridisation tests.
      <br/>
      In particular nucleic acid linked to plastic according to the invention will exhibit a linkage strength sufficiently high for it to remain substantially linked to the plastic after treatment for 10 minutes at 56 (degree)  C. with an aqueous EDTA solution of more than 1 mM.
      <br/>
      It will preferably be resistant to treatment with an aqueous EDTA solution of more than 10 mM.
      <br/>
      Treatment under the same temperature and period of time with solutions of more than 100 mM and even up to 200 mM are possible with the coated plastic obtainable with the process according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Thus a plastic substance coated in a simple manner with nucleic acid which is sufficiently strongly bound to remain bound under hybridisation conditions has been provided by the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Probably the nucleic acid attaches to the plastic via the phosphate sugar groups.
      <br/>
      The bases are thereby left available for the hybridisation test (base-pairing).
      <br/>
      Obviously carrying out amplification reactions such as PCR belongs to the possibilities.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The subject method can also be applied extremely well for linking glycosaminoglycans.
      <br/>
      For linking glycosaminoglycans one can operate very efficiently solely by applying a salt solution as described above, preferably a substantially saturated salt solution.
      <br/>
      The method however proceeds more efficiently upon combination of saturated salt conditions with an acid pH, preferably pH 0.
      <br/>
      The method can also be carried out at 4 (degree)  C. but also at higher temperatures even up to 80 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The method in any of the embodiments disclosed above is applicable for any test wherein negatively charged nucleic acid or glycosaminoglycan macrobiomolecules are involved that need to be immobilised.
      <br/>
      One can think here of assays with DNA, RNA and GAG.
      <br/>
      Modified forms of such molecules also fall within the group of biomolecules that can be applied.
      <br/>
      One of the more important areas of application lies in diagnostic methods in which DNA/RNA are involved, in particular for detecting pathogenic organisms with the aid of specific DNA probes by means of hybridisation techniques.
      <br/>
      In addition the diagnosis of diseases in which anti DNA or anti RNA or anti GAG antibodies are involved is another possible embodiment.
      <br/>
      Above all the biological characteristics of GAG can be well used in this manner.
      <br/>
      The HIV virus for example binds specifically to heparan sulphate (a GAG) and therefore microtitre plates coated with heparan sulphate according to the subject method can be used for detection of the HIV virus, thereby providing a very suitable AIDS test.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The subject method provides an extremely simple and cheap method for linkage of the biomolecules of the invention to plastic.
      <br/>
      It is possible to produce plastic carriers, for example microtitre plates with material linked thereto which can be maintained for a long time and in a dried form.
      <br/>
      A long time implies a period of a number of months but possibly also a number of years.
      <br/>
      Tests have been carried out with microtitre plates coated with a glycosaminoglycan such as heparan sulphate and stored in a dry form for 2 months at 4 (degree)  C. The coated microtitre plates maintained their capacity to react with specific antibodies after this period of time.
      <br/>
      The linked molecules above all remain bioactive, i.e. can still bind specific antibodies and undergo hybridisation tests because the binding places required therefore are not involved in the linkage to plastic.
      <br/>
      Furthermore with the subject method a very strong binding to plastic is obtained which is so strong that hybridisation tests with the concomitant many rinsing steps and optional heating steps are possible.
      <br/>
      Any plastic coated with a negatively charged macrobiomolecule according to the invention without the presence of a spacer molecule exhibiting a binding strength such that it is resistant to treatment with a 1 mM aqueous EDTA solution at 56 (degree)  C. for 10 minutes falls within the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      By resistant to treatment it is implied that a substantial amount of the macrobiomolecule remains attached to the plastic after the treatment with EDTA.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A further advantage of tests with such material according to the invention is that lower background values are obtained which is important in work with unpurified sera.
      <br/>
      In particular this is important for blood research.
      <br/>
      In the subject method sufficient material is linked to render tests extremely sensitive.
      <br/>
      As a further advantage it can be mentioned that material with which the plastic is coated is compatible with every detection system that is current such as by means of radio activity, enzyme markers, fluorescent markers and chemo luminescent markers.
      <br/>
      An additional advantage is that in particular upon application of nucleic acid like RNA, DNA and GAG's the enzymes that usually degrade such substrates (RNAse, DNAse and glycosidases) are not active.
      <br/>
      In particular for RNA applications this is extremely interesting because these tests are usually very sensitive to RNA degradation.

    <p num="44">Quantification of Heparan Sulphate Upon Application of an Inhibition Enzyme Immuno Test.</p>
    <p num="45">
      In FIG. 6 the results of this tests are illustrated.
      <br/>
      Heparan sulphate (1  MU g/100  MU l) was contacted with microtitre wells in a solution of 1 M HCl and 100% saturation with NaCl.
      <br/>
      The linkage step was carried out for 2 days at 4 (degree)  C. The heparan sulphate to be quantified was incubated for 16 hours with mouse antiheparan sulphate antibodies at 4 (degree)  C. This mixture was subsequently transferred to wells coated with heparan sulphate according to the subject method in order to let free antibody bind to the bound heparan sulphate.
      <br/>
      Bound antibody was detected upon application of anti mouse IgG antibodies which were conjugated to alkaline phosphatase.
      <br/>
      Upon application of a solution of 1  MU g heparan sulphate per 100  MU l the decrease in concentration of the solution can be so small as a result of the small amount of heparan sulphate that binds (probably of the order of some nanograms) that a solution already used for coating can be used a number of times to coat other plates.
      <br/>
      The detection limit for this test lies at approximately 10 ng heparan sulphate.
