      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to garden tools and more particularly pertains to a new angled garden tool for manipulating earth from a standing or crouch position.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The use of garden tools is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      More specifically, garden tools heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Known prior art includes U.S. Pat. No. 2,753,785; U.S. Pat. No. 1,823,254; U.S. Pat. No. Des. 305,604; U.S. Pat. No. 4,645,010; U.S. Pat. No. 1,931,349; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,351,395.</p>
    <p num="6">In these respects, the angled garden tool according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of manipulating earth from a standing or crouch position.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of garden tools now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new angled garden tool construction wherein the same can be utilized for manipulating earth from a standing or crouch position.</p>
    <p num="8">The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new angled garden tool apparatus and method which has many of the advantages of the garden tools mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new angled garden tool which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art garden tools, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="9">
      To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a head having a first side extent with a substantially planar rhomboid configuration.
      <br/>
      The first side extent is defined by a pair of elongated side edges and a pair of short end angled garden tools forming acute and obtuse angles with the side angled garden tools.
      <br/>
      Associated therewith is a central extent with a substantially planar rhomboid configuration defined by a pair of elongated side edges and a pair of short end edges.
      <br/>
      Similar to those of the first side extent of the head, the short end edges of the central extent form acute and obtuse angles with the side edges.
      <br/>
      Further, one of the side edges of the central extent is integrally coupled to one of the side edges of the first side extent.
      <br/>
      As such, the first side extent resides in a plane that forms a 120 degree angle with that in which the central extent resides.
      <br/>
      The head further includes a second side extent with a substantially planar rhomboid configuration defined by a pair of elongated side edges and a pair of short end edges forming acute and obtuse angles, as set forth hereinabove.
      <br/>
      One of the side edges of the second side extent is integrally coupled to one of the side edges of the central extent.
      <br/>
      As such, the second side extent resides in a plane that forms a 120 degree angle with that in which the central extent resides.
      <br/>
      Such second side extent further remains in parallel with that in which that first side extent resides.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 1 &amp; 2, the first side extent of the head further includes an upturned extension integrally formed on one of the end edges thereof.
      <br/>
      Such extension resides adjacent to one of the side edges opposite the central extent of the head.
      <br/>
      The extension has a width of about 1/2 that of the first side extent of the head.
      <br/>
      An outer terminal edges of the extension is sharpened and has a first linear portion and a second beveled portion.
      <br/>
      One of the end edges of the second side extent of the head has a triangular configuration.
      <br/>
      Such triangular end edges is positioned on a diagonally opposed side of the head with respect to the upturned extension.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 1 &amp; 2, a grip, or handle, is provided with a planar inverted U-shaped configuration having a pair of ends coupled to a top surface of the first side extent of the head.
      <br/>
      The grip is preferably positioned adjacent to the central extent of the head.
      <br/>
      In use, the grip lies within a plane positioned in perpendicular relationship with that in which the first side extent of the head resides.
      <br/>
      Finally, a handle rod mount includes a substantially conical socket having a tapered end integrally coupled to one of the ends of the grip.
      <br/>
      The handle rod mount extends away from the extension of the first side extent of the head and further remains in coplanar relationship with the grip.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the handle rod mount is situated at an angle of about 30 degrees with respect to the plane in which the first side extent of the head resides.
      <br/>
      The handle rod mount preferably has a pair of bores formed therein for removably coupling a hand rod therein in coaxial relationship therewith.

    <p num="23">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIGS. 1 through 4 thereof, a new angled garden tool embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The present invention, designated as numeral 10, includes a head 12 having a first side extent 14 with a substantially planar rhomboid configuration.
      <br/>
      The first side extent is defined by a pair of elongated side edges and a pair of short end edges forming acute and obtuse angles with the side edges.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Associated therewith is a central extent 16 with a substantially planar rhomboid configuration defined by a pair of elongated side edges 40, 41 and a pair of short end edges 42, 43.
      <br/>
      Similar to those of the first side extent of the head, the short end edges of the central extent form acute and obtuse angles with the side edges.
      <br/>
      Further, one of the side edges of the central extent is integrally coupled to one of the side edges of the first side extent.
      <br/>
      As such, the first side extent resides in a plane that forms a 120 degree angle with that in which the central extent resides.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The head further includes a second side extent 18 with a substantially planar rhomboid configuration defined by a pair of elongated side edges and a pair of short end edges forming acute and obtuse angles, as set forth hereinabove.
      <br/>
      One of the side angled garden tools of the second side extent is integrally coupled to one of the side edges of the central extent.
      <br/>
      As such, the second side extent resides in a plane that forms a 120 degree angle with that in which the central extent resides.
      <br/>
      Such second side extent further remains in parallel with that in which that first side extent resides.
    </p>
    <p num="27">In the preferred embodiment, end edges of the second side extent are rearwardly positioned with respect to the end edges of the first side extent with the central extent between beveled therebetween.</p>
    <p num="28">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 &amp; 2, the first side extent of the head further includes an upturned extension 20 integrally formed on one of the end edges thereof.
      <br/>
      Such extension resides adjacent to one of the side edges opposite the central extent of the head.
      <br/>
      The extension has a width of about 1/2 that of the first side extent of the head.
      <br/>
      An outer terminal angled garden tool of the extension is sharpened and has a first linear portion 22 and a second beveled portion 24.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      One of the end edges of the second side extent of the head has a tapered configuration 26.
      <br/>
      Such tapered end edges is positioned on a diagonally opposed side of the head with respect to the upturned extension.
      <br/>

      As shown in FIGS. 1 &amp; 2, a grip 28, or a handle, is constructed from a planar member having an inverted U-shaped configuration with a pair of ends 34, 35 coupled to a top surface of the first side extent of the head.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the grip has a pair of legs which positioned at a 69.8 and 37.5 degree angle with respect to the plane in which the first side extent resides, respectively.
      <br/>
      The grip is preferably positioned adjacent to the central extent of the head.
      <br/>
      In use, the grip lies within a plane positioned in perpendicular relationship with that in which the first side extent of the head resides.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Finally, a handle rod mount 30 includes a substantially conical socket having a tapered end integrally coupled to one of the ends of the grip.
      <br/>
      The handle rod mount extends away from the extension of the first side extent of the head and further remains in coplanar relationship with the grip.
