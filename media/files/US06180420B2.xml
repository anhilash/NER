      <br/>
      Chemical vapor deposition is used to form a film of Bi oxide, Sr oxide, and Ta oxide on a heated substrate by decomposing the precursors of these oxides at the surface of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The precursor of Bi oxide is a Bi complex which includes at least one carboxylate group and is decomposed and deposited at a temperature lower than 450° C.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to chemical vapor deposition methods for providing a Bi-containing metal oxide film on a surface of a substrate by decomposing a precursor of Bi oxide.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Interest in ferroelectrics has increased in recent years, due to the utility of these materials in applications such as non-volatile memories.
      <br/>
      Information in these memories is stored by the polarization of a thin ferroelectric layer which is placed between the two plates of a capacitor.
      <br/>
      The capacitor is connected to a transistor to form a storage cell, which controls the access of read-out electronics to the capacitor.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The information stored in the cell can be changed by applying an electric field to the thin ferroelectric layer and flipping the polarization.
      <br/>
      Ferroelectric random access memories (FERAMs), unlike DRAMs (dynamic random access memories), retain the stored information if the power supply is turned off.
      <br/>
      In addition, they do not require refresh cycles.
      <br/>
      Desirable electrical properties for ferroelectrics used in memory applications include: (a) a low coercive field, which makes the use of as low a voltage supply as possible; (b) a high remanent polarization, which is needed for high reliability of information storage; (c) minimal fatigue, which is required for a long life-time; and (d) no imprint, as an imprint would alter the stored information.

    <p num="6">
      Strontium bismuth tantalate (SrBi2 Ta2 O9) (SBT) is a ferroelectric material that meets all of these requirements.
      <br/>
      Significant efforts are therefore being made to integrate this material into memory devices.
      <br/>
      Capacitors in which SBT is incorporated using a sol-gel method have good electrical properties.
      <br/>
      The sol-gel method provides only a low integration density of SBT, however.
      <br/>
      To achieve a higher integration density of SBT, an alternative method, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), must be used.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      In one aspect, the invention features a method of forming a Bi-containing metal oxide film on a substrate, by decomposing a precursor of Bi oxide and depositing the Bi oxide on the substrate.
      <br/>
      Bi complexes which include at least one carboxylate group are used as the precursors of Bi oxide.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Embodiments of this aspect of the invention may include one or more of the following features.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The precursor of Bi oxide is dissolved in a solution prior to being decomposed.
      <br/>
      The deposition temperature is preferably lower than 450 (degree)  C., and is more preferably lower than 400 (degree)  C. The Bi oxide-containing film may also be provided by adding the steps of decomposing a precursor of Sr oxide, and a precursor of Ta oxide to form Sr oxide and Ta oxide, respectively, and depositing the Bi oxide, the Sr oxide, and the Ta oxide on the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The Bi-containing metal oxide film may be deposited as a ferroelectric film or can be converted into a ferroelectric film by an annealing process.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The Bi-containing metal oxide film is formed by placing the substrate in a CVD chamber, heating the substrate to a deposition temperature lower than 450 (degree)  C., introducing vapors of the precursors of Bi, Sr, and Ta oxides to the CVD chamber, decomposing the precursors of Bi, Sr, and Ta oxides, and depositing the oxides on the substrate.
      <br/>
      Precursors of Bi, Sr, and Ta oxides may be decomposed in the presence of an oxidizer by oxidative decomposition, where examples of the oxidizers include O2, singlet O2, O3, H2 O2, N2 O, NOx (1 &lt;= x &lt;= 3), and downstream oxygen plasma, and where the concentration of the oxidizer is between 5% and 95% of the total gas and vapor flow into the CVD chamber.
      <br/>
      At least one of O2 and N2 O may be used as the oxidizer.
      <br/>
      The oxidizer may be formed in the CVD chamber by converting an oxidizer molecule into an active oxidizer by applying to the CVD chamber plasma, UV light, heat, a sensitizer, or ion beams.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The precursor of Bi oxide may have the formula Bi(O2 CR)3, Bi(O2 CR)2 (O2 CR'), or Bi(O2 CR)(O2 CR')(O2 CR"), where each of R, R', and R" is, independently, an alkyl, an aryl, or a silyl group.
      <br/>
      For example, R may be t pentyl, pentyl, t Bu, Bu, i Pr, Pr, Et, Me, Ph, aryl, or SiR"3, and R" may be t Bu, Bu, i Pr, Pr, Et, or Me.
      <br/>
      The precursor of Bi oxide may also include an alkoxy group, a phenoxy group, or a donor atom such as N, O, or S.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The Bi-containing metal oxide deposited on the substrate may have the formula (Bi2 O2)2+ (Am-1 Bm O3m+1)2-, where A is Bi3+, L3+, L2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Pb2+, or Na+, B is Fe3+, Al3+, Sc3+, Y3+, L3+, L4+, Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+, W6+, or Mo6+, and L is Ce4+, La3+, Pr3+, Ho3+, Eu2+, or Yb2+, where 1 &lt;= m &lt;= 5.
      <br/>
      The Bi-containing metal oxide may also have the formula Bi2 WO6 ; BiMO3, where M is Fe or Mn; Ba2 BiMO6, where M is V, Nb or Ta; Pb2 BiMO6, where M is V, Nb or Ta; Ba3 Bi2 MO9, where M is Mo or W; Pb3 Bi2 MO9, where M is Mo or W; Ba6 BiMO18, where M is Mo or W; Pb6 BiMO18, where M is Mo or W; KBiTi2 O6 ; or K2 BiNb5 O15.
      <br/>
      These metal oxides can be obtained by decomposing precursors which contain the above-described metals.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The Bi-containing metal oxide film can also be a SBT derivative.
      <br/>
      Examples of such derivatives include SrBi2 Ta2 O9 ; SrBi2 Ta2-x Nbx O9, where 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 2; SrBi2 Nb2 O9 ; Sr1-x Bax Bi2 Ta2-y Nby O9, where 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1 and 0 &lt;= y &lt;= 2; Sr1-x Cax Bi2 Ta2-y Nby O9 where 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1 and 0 &lt;= y &lt;= 2; Sr1-x Pbx Bi2 Ta2-y Nby O9, where 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1 and 0 &lt;= y &lt;= 2; and Sr1-x-y-z Bax Cay Pbz Bi2 Ta2-p Nbp O9, where 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1, 0 &lt;= y &lt;= 1, 0 &lt;= z &lt;= 1, and 0 &lt;= p &lt;= 2).
      <br/>
      An element of the metal oxide may be substituted by a metal such as Ce, La, Pr, Ho, Eu, and Yb.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The precursor of Sr oxide generally has the formula Sr(thd)2 or Sr(thd)2 adduct, and may include a polyether or a polyamine.
      <br/>
      The polyether has the formula R--O--(CH2 CH2 O)n --R', where 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 6, and where each of R and R' may be, independently, an alkyl group, an aryl group, or hydrogen.
      <br/>
      The polyamine has the formula R--NR"--(CH2 CH2 NR")n --R', where 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 6, where each of R and R' may be, independently, an alkyl group, an aryl group, or hydrogen, and where R" is H, Me, Et, or Pr.
      <br/>
      The precursor of Sr oxide may also include tetraglyme, triglyme, N, N, N', N", N"-pentamethyl-diethylene-triamine, or N, N, N', N", N'", N'"-hexamethyl-triethylene-tetramine.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The precursor of Ta oxide generally has the formula Ta(OR)5-n (X)n, where R is Me, Et, Pr, i Pr, Bu, i Bu, t Bu, pentyl, or pentyl, where X is  BETA -diketonate, and where 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 5.
      <br/>
      For example, the precursor may be Ta(Oi Pr)4 (thd).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The precursors of the Bi, Sr, and Ta oxides are dissolved in a solution of an aliphatic, a cycloaliphatic, or an aromatic solvent that may include a functional group such as an alcohol, ether, ester, amine, ketone, or aldehyde group.
      <br/>
      For example, the precursors of Bi, Sr, and Ta oxides may be dissolved in a solvent such as butylacetate.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the precursors may be dissolved in a mixture of THF, i PrOH, and a Lewis base in a ratio of about 8:2:1, respectively, or a mixture of octane, decane, and pentamethyl-diethylene-triamine in a ratio of about 5:4:1.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The solutions containing the precursors are evaporated by vaporizers.
      <br/>
      For example, the solution containing the precursor of Bi oxide is evaporated at a temperature from 130 (degree)  C. to 300 (degree)  C., and the solution for the precursors of Sr and Ta oxides is evaporated at a temperature from 170 (degree)  C. to 240 (degree)  C. An inert gas such as Ar, He, or N2 is added to the vapors of the solution, and a mixture of the inert gas and vapors is delivered to the CVD chamber.
      <br/>
      For example, the mixture includes vapors of the precursors of Bi oxide, Sr oxide, and Ta oxide in a ratio of about 2:1:2.
      <br/>
      It is appreciated that the concentrations of the precursors in the vapor mixture depend on several factors, including vaporization temperature, pressure in the vaporizer, gas and vapor flow rate, desired film stoichiometry, and geometry of the CVD chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the CVD chamber, the substrate is heated to the deposition temperature of 350 (degree)  C. to 450 (degree)  C. The pressure in the CVD chamber is maintained between 0.001 torr and 760 torr, for example, between 0.1 torr and 10 torr.
      <br/>
      An additional inert gas is added to the CVD chamber, where the concentration of the inert gas may vary from 10% to 90% of the total gas and vapor flow into the CVD chamber, for example, 30% to 50%.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the vapors of the precursors, the oxidizers, and an inert gas are introduced to the CVD chamber at a total flow rate of 1 ml/min to 15,000 ml/min, measured at the standard condition.
      <br/>
      The desirable flow rate may also depend on the temperature and pressure of the gas and vapor mixture, desired film stoichiometry, and geometry of the CVD chamber.
      <br/>
      The oxides are deposited onto the substrate over a time period between 2 minutes and 2 hours, for example, between 2 minutes and 15 minutes.
      <br/>
      After deposition, the film is heated to a temperature of 600 (degree)  C. to 800 (degree)  C. for a time period between 5 minutes and 3 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The substrate preferably includes Si, n-doped Si, p-doped Si, SiO2, Si3 N4, GaAs, MgO, Al2 O3, ZrO2, SrTiO3, BaTiO3, or PbTiO3.
      <br/>
      The film of Bi-containing metal oxide is deposited on a bottom electrode disposed on the substrate, which includes a transistor.
      <br/>
      The bottom electrode is connected to the transistor by a plug.
      <br/>
      The bottom electrode may include a metal such as Pt, Pd, Au, Ir, or Rh; a conducting metal oxide such as IrOx, RhOx, RuOx, OsOx, ReOx, or WOx, where 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 2; a conducting metal nitride such as TiNx, ZrNx, or WNy TaNy, where 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1.0 and 0 &lt;= y &lt;= 1.7; or a superconducting oxide such as YBa2 Cu3 O7-x where 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1, and Bi2 Sr2 Ca2 Cu3 O10.
      <br/>
      The bottom electrode may be a Pt electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A first intermediate layer may be provided between the bottom electrode and the plug.
      <br/>
      Examples of the first intermediate layer include a Ti adhesion layer and a Ti nitride diffusion barrier layer.
      <br/>
      A second intermediate layer may also be provided between the bottom electrode and the metal oxide layer.
      <br/>
      Examples of the second intermediate layer include a seed layer, a conducting layer, and a dielectric layer of high permittivity.
      <br/>
      The plug may include W or Si, and is connected to the bottom electrode and to a source/drain of a MOS field effect transistor.
      <br/>
      The film may also be used as a thin ferroelectric film for a ferroelectric capacitor, a ferroelectric memory, and/or a ferroelectric field effect transistor, for example, a metal ferroelectric semiconductor or a metal ferroelectric insulating semiconductor.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The substrate may be flushed with a mixture of an inert gas and the oxidizer before and/or after being exposed to the vapors of the precursors of the metal oxides.
      <br/>
      The processes of heating, decomposing, and depositing may be performed at least twice on the substrate.
      <br/>
      The substrate may also be removed from the chamber, treated by at least one intermediate process, such as a rapid thermal process, and returned to the chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The operating conditions of the CVD may also be changed.
      <br/>
      For example, the compositions of the precursors, oxidizers, and inert gas in the mixture may be varied while the substrate is positioned in the chamber.
      <br/>
      Deposition temperature as well as the chamber pressure may also be varied.
      <br/>
      The precursor of Bi oxide may be delivered to the CVD chamber during a period between the onset of deposition and 30 minutes thereafter; the concentration of the Bi oxide is then decreased.
      <br/>
      In other methods, the substrate may be heated inside the chamber at a temperature lower than 450 (degree)  C. at least twice, or the substrate may be heated inside the chamber at a temperature lower than 450 (degree)  C. in the presence of at least one of the oxidizers O2 and O3.

    <p num="24">
      In another aspect, the invention features a method of forming a metal oxide film on a substrate, by heating the substrate to a temperature lower than 450 (degree)  C. and introducing vapors of a precursor of Bi oxide to the substrate.
      <br/>
      Bi complexes which include at least one carboxylate group are used as the precursors of Bi oxide.
      <br/>
      The precursor of Bi oxide decomposes at the surface of the substrate to form Bi oxide, which is deposited on the surface of the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      As used herein, the term "precursor of Bi oxide" means any Bi complex which may be degraded to form Bi oxide.
      <br/>
      Examples of precursors of Bi oxide include Bi carboxylates, which have the structure Bi(O2 CR)3, Bi(O2 CR)2 (O2 CR'), or Bi(O2 CR)(O2 CR')(O2 CR"), where each of R, R', and R" is, independently, an alkyl or an aryl group.
      <br/>
      Bi carboxylates also include derivatives of the above-described precursors.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The use of Bi carboxylates as the precursors of Bi oxide in chemical vapor deposition offers numerous advantages.
      <br/>
      Bi carboxylates contain Bi--O bonds which are relatively easy to cleave.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, Bi carboxylates can be decomposed at relatively low temperatures.
      <br/>
      Decomposition and deposition at lower temperatures decreases the migration of Bi oxide to the bottom electrode and the substrate.
      <br/>
      The degradation of the pre-existing structure is thereby minimized.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, Bi carboxylates do not require oxygen as a co-reactant for the formation of Bi oxide.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="30">
      Chemical vapor deposition can be used to provide a thin film of Bi, Sr, and Ta oxides on a surface of a substrate.
      <br/>
      The substrate can then be used to manufacture devices such as storage cells.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Referring to FIG. 1, a storage cell is formed by placing a layer 1 of ferroelectric material between two plates of a capacitor 2.
      <br/>
      Capacitor 2 is connected to transistor 3 which has a bit-line 4 and a word-line 5, and which controls access of read-out electronics to capacitor 2.
      <br/>
      Ferroelectric layer 1 stores information by polarization in a non-volatile manner.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Referring to FIG. 2, a ferroelectric SBT layer 9 is incorporated into a stack capacitor with a transistor to form a storage cell.
      <br/>
      The stack capacitor sits on top of the transistor, and the bottom electrode 6 of the capacitor is connected with a drain of the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor-feel-effect-transistor) by a plug 8 which is made from either poly Si or W. Ferroelectric layer 9 is disposed between the bottom electrode 6 and the top electrode 10.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is used to provide the ferroelectric layers in FIGS. 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      For example, CVD is used to deposit layers of metal oxides of Bi, Sr, and Ta on a Pt/Ti/SiO2 /Si substrate.
      <br/>
      During CVD, a substrate is placed in a CVD chamber at a low pressure, and is heated to a deposition temperature.
      <br/>
      Precursors are vaporized and then delivered to the CVD chamber.
      <br/>
      Vapors of the precursors are decomposed at the surface of the substrate, and metal oxide molecules are deposited on the substrate to form a thin film.
      <br/>
      Metal oxide films formed by the CVD process have higher conformality and better step coverage than films produced by other methods.
      <br/>
      Further advantages of the CVD process include high film uniformity, high film density, the capability to grow very thin films, a high throughput, and low manufacturing costs.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Precursors for Bi Oxides</p>
    <p num="35">
      Bi carboxylates contain C--O bonds which are relatively easy to cleave.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, when Bi carboxylates are used as precursors of Bi oxide, oxygen is not required as a co-reactant for the formation of Bi oxide.
      <br/>
      It is believed that these properties of Bi carboxylates contribute to the favorable decomposition mechanism of Bi carboxylates and conformal deposition of Bi oxides.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Bi oxides can be deposited at low temperatures, for example, at 300 (degree)  C. Oxides of Bi, Sr, and Ta can be deposited together in a desired film stoichiometry, such as Bi2 O3 --SrO--Ta2 O5.
      <br/>
      The SBT film obtained using Bi carboxylate as a precursor of Bi oxide exhibits high uniformity of composition within the wafer, high conformity to the structure of the surface, and high run-to-run repeatability.
      <br/>
      The film of Bi, Sr, and Ta oxides formed by the low temperature deposition is generally non-ferroelectric but can be transformed, by a post-deposition treatment such as annealing, into a ferroelectric Aurivilius phase.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Bi carboxylates used as precursors of Bi oxides generally have the structure Bi(O2 CR)3, Bi(O2 CR)2 (O2 CR'), or Bi(O2 CR)(O2 CR')(O2 CR"), where each of R, R', and R" is, independently, an alkyl, an aryl, or a silyl group.
      <br/>
      For example, R may be t pentyl, pentyl, t Bu, Bu, i Pr, Pr, Et, Me, Ph, aryl, or SiR'"3, where R'" may be t Bu, Bu, i Pr, Pr, Et, or Me.
      <br/>
      Examples of Bi carboxylates include Bi(O2 C--C5 H11)3, Bi(O2 C--CMe2 Et)3, Bi(O2 C-t Bu)3, and Bi(O2 C--i Pr)3.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Bi carboxylates also include derivatives of the precursors discussed above.
      <br/>
      They also include derivatives in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms are replaced by alkoxy, phenoxy, or silyl groups.
      <br/>
      They also include derivatives in which the alkyl groups are substituted with donor atoms, such as N, O, or S.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      All of these molecules are capable of undergoing oxidative decomposition at very low temperatures.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, these molecules yield Bi oxides in a controlled and reproducible manner.
      <br/>

    <p num="40">Bi-Containing Metal Oxides</p>

      Bi-containing metal oxides deposited on the substrate generally have the following structure:

    <p num="61">
      Precursors of Bi, Sr, and Ta oxides are decomposed in the presence of an oxidizer by oxidative decomposition.
      <br/>
      O2 is generally used as an oxidizer.
      <br/>
      However, deposition efficiency may be improved by using more reactive oxidizers during the film deposition.
      <br/>
      Examples of these alternate oxidizers include singlet O2, O3, H2 O2, N2 O, NOx (1 &lt;= x &lt;= 3), and downstream oxygen plasma.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The concentration of the oxidizer may be maintained at a level between 5% and 95% of the total gas and vapor flow into the CVD chamber.
      <br/>
      At least one of O2 and N2 O may be used as the oxidizer.
      <br/>
      The oxidizer may be supplied to the CVD chamber from an external source such as a tank, or may be formed in the CVD chamber by converting a molecule therein into an active oxidizer by applying to the CVD chamber plasma, UV light, heat, a sensitizer, or ion beams.

    <p num="63">
      O3 can form oxygen radicals O which can react with the precursors of Bi oxide, Sr oxide, and/or Ta oxide.
      <br/>
      The reaction may occur in the boundary layer, for example, by inserting the O radical into the Bi--O bonds or by undergoing an electrocyclical bimolecular reaction.
      <br/>
      When O3 reacts with a precursor containing a phenyl ring, O3 may attack the ring and crack the molecule from another side, yielding an intermediate product such as O.dbd.BiPh3, which may either decompose back to BiPh3 or undergo a rearrangement to form a (PhO)BiPh2. Chemical properties of the substrate surface may also be affected by O3.
      <br/>
      For example, the amount of adsorbed O atoms may be increased, or the electrochemical potential of the surface and its electrical conductivity may be altered.
      <br/>
      O3 may also affect the chemical properties of the surface of the Bi-containing metal oxide film during its growth in the (CVD chamber.

    <p num="64">
      NO and NO2 can react with the precursors already in the boundary layer.
      <br/>
      In addition, NO and NO2 can be adsorbed on the substrate, react with intermediate products from the decomposition reaction of the precursors, or increase the substrate surface potential for further chemical reactions.

    <p num="65">
      H2 O2 can react with the precursors in the boundary layer or at the heterogenous surface.

      The use of oxidizers offers a number of benefits in depositing the Bi-containing metal oxide film.
      <br/>
      In general, oxidizers allow low temperature deposition of Bi oxides on the substrate.
      <br/>
      Oxidizers also stabilize and enhance the deposition of Bi oxides at low pressures.
      <br/>
      Oxidizers also help in depositing the Bi-containing metal oxide film in a desirable phase.
    </p>
    <p num="69">CVD Process</p>
    <p num="70">
      The substrate is heated to a deposition temperature ranging from 300 (degree)  C. to 500 (degree)  C. Preferably, the substrate is heated to a temperature below 450 (degree)  C. The pressure in the chamber is maintained between 0.1 and 10 torr.
      <br/>
      A carrier gas such as Ar, He, or N2, and oxidizers such as O2, singlet O2, O3, N2 O, NOx (1 &lt;= x &lt;= 3), and downstream oxygen plasma are also delivered to the CVD chamber.
      <br/>
      The total gas flow is maintained between 1 and 15,000 sccm, where sccm represents a volumetric flow rate in the unit of cc/min measured at the standard condition, that is, at 0 (degree)  C. and 1 atm. The deposition time ranges from 30 to 60 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      CVD processes for SBT can be carried out at different deposition temperatures.
      <br/>
      For example, the CVD process at a temperature such as 430 (degree)  C. yields a non-ferroelectric film in the fluorite phase.
      <br/>
      By annealing between 600 (degree)  C. and 820 (degree)  C., for example, at 750 (degree)  C. for one hour, this film is converted into the ferroelectric Aurivilius phase.
      <br/>
      The structure of the deposited film depends on many different deposition parameters, although the deposition temperature has the most profound effect.
      <br/>
      For example, films deposited at lower temperatures, for example, at 350 (degree)  C., are predominately amorphous.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      At high temperatures, for example, 650 (degree)  C., the CVD process yields films which are in a crystalline non-ferroelectric phase, such as a fluorite phase, or which are already in the ferroelectric Aurivilius phase.
      <br/>
      By annealing at 800 (degree)  C. (ferroanneal), the non-ferroelectric SBT layer can be transformed into the ferroelectric Aurivilius phase, or the electrical properties of the existing ferroelectric films can be enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Alternatively, the deposition may be carried out under two different conditions.
      <br/>
      For example, it may be advantageous to deposit more Bi oxides in the beginning of the CVD process than during the rest of the process to compensate for a loss of Bi oxides due to depletion into the bottom electrode during deposition and/or annealing.
      <br/>
      It may also be helpful to have a nucleation control in the beginning, even if this decreases the growth rate.
      <br/>
      After the nucleation step, the conditions are changed for a high growth rate in the second deposition step.
      <br/>
      Nucleation is very important for phase control and can be very important for composition control, for example, if the film composition depends on the nature of the surface.

      The high-temperature process results in a film which is in a non-ferroelectric fluorite phase, in a ferroelectric Aurivilius phase, or in a mixture of these phases.
    </p>
    <p num="94">After the CVD process, the deposited film is annealed at 750 (degree)  C. for 60 minutes or at 800 (degree)  C. for 15 minutes in order to form and/or to completely crystallize the ferroelectric Aurivilius phase.</p>
    <p num="95">EXAMPLE 5</p>
    <p num="96">Multi-Step CVD Process</p>
    <p num="97">
      A multi-step process is also used, where a different deposition condition is applied for the first 2-10 minutes in order to yield a higher Bi content in the parts of the film adjacent to the Pt bottom electrode than in the rest of the film.
      <br/>
      An increased amount of the precursor of Bi oxide is delivered to the CVD chamber for the first 2-10 minutes, for example, by increasing the liquid delivery rate of the second, Bi carboxylate vaporizer.
      <br/>
      All other parameters in this step, and all parameters for the second step, are the same as those used in the single-step process.
