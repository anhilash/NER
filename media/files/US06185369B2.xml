    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="10">A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="11">
      FIG. 2 shows an apparatus for synchronously reproducing multi-angle data according to an embodiment of the present invention, the apparatus including a plurality of reproducers 20, 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) which are sequentially connected one after another.
      <br/>
      The number of reproducers is identical to the number of angles of multiplexed data for multi-angle reproduction, in which nine reproducers are connected at a maximum in the case of a DVD system.
      <br/>
      A main reproducer 20 among the plurality of reproducers 20, 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) receives a data stream in which data is multiplexed for multi-angle reproduction obtained from a DVD disk.
      <br/>
      Later on, when broadcasting providing multi-angle reproduction is initiated, a data stream in which data is multiplexed for multi-angle reproduction is obtained from a cable TV or a wireless broadcasting station.
      <br/>
      The sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) receive the data stream from the preceding reproducer, respectively.
      <br/>
      The main reproducer 20 and the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) separate data corresponding to a predetermined angle from the received data stream, respectively.
      <br/>
      The main reproducer 20 and the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) decode and reproduce the separated data at respective angles.
      <br/>
      The main reproducer 20 controls synchronization of data reproduction of the main reproducer 20 and the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n).
      <br/>
      The detailed structure of the main reproducer 20 is shown in FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing the main reproducer 20 of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The main reproducer 20 shown in FIG. 3 includes a channel data processor 31 for receiving a data stream in which data read from a storage medium such as a DVD and received from a broadcasting station for multi-angle reproduction is multiplexed, and processing the received data in the form of a desired pattern, a switch SW for selecting between the data stream processed in the channel data processor 31 and a data stream received from a preceding reproducer for the other viewing angles and a data separator 32 for separating data corresponding to a predetermined angle from the data stream selected by the switch SW.
      <br/>
      A channel buffer 33 temporarily stores the data separated in the data separator 32 and outputs the stored data at a certain bit rate.
      <br/>
      The main reproducer 20 also includes a system decoder 34 for separating video and audio data contained in the data output from the channel buffer 33, and a video decoder 35 and an audio decoder 36 for receiving the separated video and audio data and decoding the received data, respectively.
      <br/>
      An interfacer 38 performs interfacing with the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n).
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, the main reproducer 20 includes a controller 39 for controlling reproduction of the multi-angle data in synchronization with the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n), and a data transmitter/receiver 37 for transmitting and receiving data of the other viewing angles.
      <br/>
      The sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) may have the same structure as that of the main reproducer 20 shown in FIG. 3, or a different structure therefrom, respectively.
      <br/>
      When the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) are constructed differently from the main reproducer 20, they do not have a device for directly reproducing data from a disk or receiving an aerial broadcast (not shown in FIG. 3) nor the channel data processor 31, which are included in the main reproducer 20 shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      When the same structure as that of the main reproducer 20 is used as the sub-reproducer, one of the reproducers which accepts a disk and initially reproduces data from the disk is automatically set as a main reproducer and the other reproducers not containing a disk are automatically set as sub-reproducers.
      <br/>
      Here, the operations of the main reproducer 20 and the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) will be described below in more detail with reference to FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In the main reproducer 20, the channel data processor 31 receives a data stream for multi-angle reproduction which is multiplexed in the form of a program stream of FIG. 1 received from an aerial broadcast, a cable TV or read from a storage medium such as a DVD, and processes the received data in a necessary form.
      <br/>
      The data stream processed in the channel data processor 31 is input to the data separator 32 via the switch SW.
      <br/>
      The data separator 32 separates data corresponding to a predetermined angle from the received data stream and outputs the separated data to the channel buffer 33, and the data stream containing the remaining data to the data transmitter/receiver 37.
      <br/>
      In case of the DVD system, the data separator 32 separates only data of the predetermined angle using data search information contained in the data stream.
      <br/>
      For example, when only data corresponding to a certain angle is intended to be reproduced, the data separator 32 separates data D1 among the data multiplexed in the form of the program stream of FIG. 1 and outputs the separated result to the channel buffer 33, and outputs the data D2 through D9 of the other angles to the data transmitter/receiver 37.
      <br/>
      The data transmitter/receiver 37 transmits the data stream containing the data of the other angles output from the data separator 32 to a first sub-reproducer 21(1) via the interfacer 38.
      <br/>
      Since the data corresponding to the predetermined angle separated in the data separator 32 is compressed and encoded according to the MPEG-2 standard and has an inconsistent bit rate, the channel buffer 33 temporarily stores the data and outputs it to the system decoder 34 at a constant bit rate.
      <br/>
      The system decoder 34 separates video and audio data of the corresponding angles contained in the data output from the channel buffer 33 and outputs them to the video decoder 35 and the audio decoder 36, respectively.
      <br/>
      The video decoder 35 decodes the input video data according to the MPEG-2 standard.
      <br/>
      The audio decoder 36 decodes the input audio data according to the AC 3 or MPEG-2 standard.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Meanwhile, each of the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) has the same structure as that of the main reproducer 20 and operates in the same manner as that of the main reproducer 20.
      <br/>
      In each of the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n), the data separator 32 receives, via the switch SW, the data stream of the remaining angles received by the data transmitter/receiver 37 from a preceding reproducer via the interfacer 38.
      <br/>
      The data separator 32 separates data corresponding to the predetermined angle from the input data stream and outputs the separated result to the channel buffer 33, and outputs the data of the other angles to the data transmitter/receiver 37.
      <br/>
      The first sub-reproducer 21(1) receives data of the angles other than that corresponding to the main reproducer 20, a second sub-reproducer 21(2) receives data of the angles other than that corresponding to the main reproducer 20 and first sub-reproducer 21(1), and the other sub-reproducers receive data in the same manner, to thereby separate data of a desired angle therefrom.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the data photographed at various angles is separated during passing through the respective reproducers.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      A respective video decoder 35 in the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) temporarily stops at the time when data corresponding to an initial image has been decoded, and informs the controller 39 that a reproduction operation is ready by generating a reproduction ready notice signal.
      <br/>
      The controller 39 informs the main reproducer 20 via the interfacer 38 that the reproduction is ready, in response to the reproduction ready notice signal output from the video decoder 35.
      <br/>
      A controller 39 of the main reproducer 20 generates a reproduction command to all of the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) via the interfacer 38 if reproduction ready notice signals are supplied from all of the subreproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n).
      <br/>
      If a reproduction command generated in the main reproducer 20 is applied via the interfacer 28, each controller 39 of the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) outputs an image decoded by the video decoder 35 to a monitor (not shown) in a synchronization with the reproduction command.
      <br/>
      In this case, the main reproducer 20 outputs an image decoded in the video decoder 35 to an unshown monitor in synchronization with the reproduction command.
      <br/>
      Each controller 39 of the reproducers 20, 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) outputs an audio signal decoded in the audio decoder 36 to a speaker (not shown) in synchronization with the output of the video decoder 35.
      <br/>
      Here, there are a synchronous multi-angle reproduction having the same audio signal with respect to the multi-angle images, and an asynchronous multi-angle reproduction having a different audio signal with respect to the multi-angle images.
      <br/>
      In the case of the synchronous multi-angle reproduction, the controller 39 of the main reproducer 20 controls only one reproducer of the main reproducer 20 and the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) to reproduce audio data.
      <br/>
      In the case of the asynchronous multi-angle reproduction, the controller 39 of the main reproducer 20 controls a respective audio decoder 38 of the main reproducer 20 and the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) to reproduce audio data.
      <br/>
      As a result, only one audio signal among the reproduced audio signals is selected using an external selection device (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The main reproducer 20 reads a data stream where data for multi-angle reproduction is multiplexed from a disk, in which the disk is reproduced at sufficiently fast speed so that the data stream is supplied to all the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) within a predetermined time.
      <br/>
      All the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) can use the same disk as in the main reproducer 20, and read the multiplexed data stream from the disk.
      <br/>
      In this case, a disk is reproduced at normal speed and reproduction information is given to or taken from the main reproducer 20 for synchronous reproduction.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Meanwhile, a DVD system or a digital broadcasting system can be constructed so that a plurality of audio information can be supported.
      <br/>
      In the case of a DVD system which can support a multi-lingual service, a multiplexed data stream contains audio data for multi-language as eight sub-streams at maximum.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the respective sub-streams are reproduced, eight different language voices can be listened to.
      <br/>
      When the above sub-streams are applied to the present invention, the sub-reproducers 21(1), . . . , and 21(n) can reproduce a respectively different language voice.
      <br/>
      That is, a respectively different language voice can be output with respect to the same image.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      An IEEE 1394 transmission standard proposed as a recent International Standard can be used in a method of connecting reproducers of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In case of the IEEE 1394 transmission standard, a bidirectional transmission condition is met and simultaneously an isochronous mode and an asynchronous mode are supported.
      <br/>
      Also, since a maximum transmission speed is 400 Mbps, the IEEE 1394 standard is appropriate for the application field in which sync information is sent between the reproducers on occasion, and simultaneously video and audio information is given to or taken from each other at a certain period of time.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As described above, an apparatus for synchronously reproducing data for multi-angle reproduction according to the present invention separates the data compressed and multiplexed for multi-angle reproduction at respective viewing angles and reproduces the separated data synchronously.
      <br/>
      Therefore, images corresponding to various viewing angles at an instant can be provided to a user, which can fulfill various viewers' desires.
