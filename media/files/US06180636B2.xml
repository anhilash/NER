    <p num="57">Compounds of the formula I having at least one acid group, for example a free carboxyl group, are capable of forming internal salts or metal or ammonium salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts, or ammonium salts with ammonia or suitable organic amines, such as tertiary monoamines, for example triethylamine or tri(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, or heterocyclic bases, for example N-ethylpiperidine or N,N'-dimethylpiperazine.</p>
    <p num="58">
      For isolation or purification purposes it is also possible to use pharmaceutically unsuitable salts, for example picrates or perchlorates.
      <br/>
      Only salts that are pharmaceutically acceptable and non-toxic (at the appropriate doses) are used therapeutically and these salts are therefore preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="59">In view of the close relationship between the novel compounds in free form and in the form of their salts, including those salts that can be used as intermediates, for example in the purification or identification of the novel compounds, hereinbefore and hereinafter the free compounds are to be understood as meaning also the corresponding salts, as appropriate and expedient.</p>
    <p num="60">
      The compounds of the formula I have valuable pharmacologically useful properties.
      <br/>
      In particular they display specific inhibitory activities that are of pharmacological interest.
      <br/>
      They are effective primarily as protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors and/or (furthermore) as inhibitors of protein serine/threonine kinases; they exhibit, for example, potent inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and of c-erbB2 kinase.
      <br/>
      These receptor-specific enzyme activities play a key role in signal transmission in a large number of mammalian cells, including human cells, especially epithelial cells, cells of the immune system and cells of the central and peripheral nervous system.
      <br/>
      For example, in various cell types, EGF-induced activation of receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinase (EGF-R-PTK) is a prerequisite for cell division and thus for the proliferation of the cell population.
      <br/>
      An increase in the number of EGF-receptor-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors thus inhibits the proliferation of the cells.
      <br/>
      The same applies analogously to the other protein kinases mentioned hereinbefore and hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="61">In addition to or instead of inhibiting EGF receptor protein tyrosine kinase, the compounds of the formula I also inhibit to varying extents other protein tyrosine kinases that are involved in signal transmission mediated by trophic factors, for example abl kinase, especially v-abl kinase, kinases from the family of the src kinases, especially c-src kinase, Ick, fyn; other kinases of the EGF family, for example c-erbB2 kinase (HER-2), c-erbB3 kinase, c-erbB4 kinase; members of the family of the PDGF receptor protein tyrosine kinases, for example PDGF receptor kinase, CSF-1 receptor kinase, Kit receptor kinase, VEGF receptor kinase and FGF receptor kinase; the receptor kinase of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1 kinase), and serine/threonine kinases, for example protein kinase C or cdc kinases, all of which play a part in growth regulation and transformation in mammalian cells, including human cells.</p>
    <p num="62">
      The inhibition of EGF-receptor-specific protein tyrosine kinase (EGF-R-PTK) can be demonstrated using known methods, for example using the recombinant intracellular domain of the EGF receptor (EGF-R ICD; see, for example, E. McGlynn et al., Europ. J. Biochem. 207, 265-275 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Compared with the control without inhibitor, the compounds of the formula I inhibit the enzyme activity by 50% (IC50), for example in a concentration of from 0.0005 to 1  MU M, especially from 0.001 to 0.1  MU M.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The action of the compounds of the formula I on EGF-stimulated cellular tyrosine phosphorylation in the EGF-receptor can be determined in the human A431 epithelial carcinoma cell line by means of an ELISA which is described in U. Trinks et al., J. Med. Chem. 37:7, 1015-1027 (1994).
      <br/>
      In this test (EGFR-ELISA) the compounds of the formula I exhibit an IC50 of approximately 0.001 to 1  MU M.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      Stimulation of quiescent BALB/c3T3 cells with EGF rapidly induces the expression of c-fos mRNA.
      <br/>
      Pretreatment of the cells with a compound of the formula I before the stimulation with EGF inhibits c-fos expression at an IC50 of approximately from 0.001 to 0.1  MU M. This test procedure is likewise described in U. Trinks et al., J. Med. Chem. 37:7,1015-1027 (1994).
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      In the micromolar range too, the compounds of the formula I also exhibit, for example, inhibition of the cell growth of EGF-dependent cell lines, for example the epidermoid BALB/c mouse keratinocyte cell line (see Weissmann, B. A., and Aaronson, S. A., Cell 32, 599 (1983)) or the A431 cell line, which are recognized as useful standard sources of EGF-dependent epithelial cells (see Carpenter, G., and Zendegni, J. Anal. Biochem. 153, 279-282 (1985)).
      <br/>
      In a known test method (see Meyer et al., Int. J. Cancer 43, 851 (1989)), the inhibitory activity of the compounds of the formula I is determined, briefly, as follows: BALB/MK cells (10 000/microtiter plate well) are transferred to 96-well microtiter plates.
      <br/>
      The test compounds (dissolved in DMSO) are added in a series of concentrations (dilution series) in such a manner that the final concentration of DMSO is not greater than 1% (v/v).
      <br/>
      After the addition, the plates are incubated for three days during which the control cultures without test compound are able to undergo at least three cell-division cycles.
      <br/>
      The growth of the MK cells is measured by means of Methylene Blue staining: after the incubation the cells are fixed with glutaraldehyde, washed with water and stained with 0.05% Methylene Blue.
      <br/>
      After a washing step the stain is eluted with 3% HCl and the optical density per well of the microtiter plate is measured using a Titertek Multiscan at 665 nm.
      <br/>
      IC50 values are determined by a computer-aided system using the formula:
      <br/>
      IC50 =�(ODtest -ODstart)/(ODcontrol -ODstart)� * 100.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The IC50 value in these experiments is given as that concentration of the test compound in question that results in a cell count that is 50% lower than that obtained using the control without inhibitor.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the formula I display inhibitory activity in the micromolar range, for example an IC50 of approximately from 0.1 to 1  MU M.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The compounds of the formula I display inhibition of the growth of tumor cells also in vivo, as shown, for example, by the test described below: the test is based on inhibition of the growth of the human epidermoid carcinoma A431 (ATCC No. CRL 1555; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md., USA; see Santon, J. B., et al., Cancer Research 46, 4701-4705 (1986) and Ozawa, S., et al., Int. J. Cancer 40, 706-710 (1987)), which is transplanted into female BALB/c nude mice (Bomholtgard, Denmark).
      <br/>
      This carcinoma exhibits a growth that correlates with the extent of the expression of the EGF-receptor.
      <br/>
      In the experiment, tumors having a volume of approximately 1 cm3 cultured in vivo are surgically removed from experimental animals under sterile conditions.
      <br/>
      These tumors are comminuted and suspended in 10 volumes (w/v) of phosphate-buffered saline.
      <br/>
      The suspension is injected s.c. (0.2 ml/mouse in phosphate-buffered saline) into the left flank of the animals.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, 1 * 106 cells from an in vitro culture in 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline can be injected.
      <br/>
      Treatment with test compounds of the formula I is started 5 or 7 days after transplantation, when the tumors have reached a diameter of 4-5 mm.
      <br/>
      The active compound in question is administered (in different doses for different animal groups) once a day for 15 successive days.
      <br/>
      The tumor growth is determined by measuring the diameter of the tumors along three axes that are perpendicular to each other.
      <br/>
      The tumor volumes are calculated using the known formula p * L * D2 /6 (see Evans, B. D., et al., Brit. J. Cancer 45, 466-8 (1982)).
      <br/>
      The results are given as treatment/control percentages (T/C * 100=T/C %).
      <br/>
      At a dose of from 3 to 50 mg/kg of active ingredient, distinct inhibition of the tumor growth is found, for example T/C % values of less than 10, which indicates strong inhibition of tumor growth.
    </p>
    <p num="68">As well as or instead of inhibiting EGF-receptor protein tyrosine kinase, the compounds of the formula I also inhibit other protein tyrosine kinases that are involved in signal transmission mediated by trophic factors, for example abl kinase, such as especially v-abl kinase (IC50 for example from 0.01 to 5  MU M), kinases from the family of the src kinases, such as especially c-src kinase (IC50 for example from 0.1 to 10  MU M) and c-erbB2 kinase (HER-2), and serine/threonine kinases, for example protein kinase C, all of which are involved in growth regulation and transformation in mammalian cells, including human cells.</p>
    <p num="69">
      The abovementioned inhibition of v-abl tyrosine kinase is determined by the methods of N. Lydon et al., Oncogene Research 5, 161-173 (1990) and J. F. Geissler et al., Cancer Research 52, 4492-4498 (1992).

      <br/>
      The c-erbB2 kinase can be isolated, and its activity determined, by means of protocols known per se, for example in accordance with T. Akiyama et al., Science 232, 1644 (1986).

      They are capable of effecting tumor regression and of preventing the formation of tumor metastases and the growth of micrometastases.

    <p num="89">In the compound of the formula IV a suitable leaving group X is preferably halogen, such as bromine, iodine or especially chlorine. 1-Aryl-lower alkyl Z is preferably 1-phenyl-lower alkyl, such as especially 1-phenylethyl or, in particular, benzyl.</p>
    <p num="90">Free functional groups present in the radicals R1 and R2, which if necessary are protected by easily removable protective groups, are especially amino or lower alkylamino.</p>
    <p num="91">
      Protective groups and their introduction and removal are described, for example, in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London, New York 1973, and in "Methoden der organischen Chemie", Houben-Weyl, 4th edition, Vol. 15/1, Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart 1974 and in Theodora W. Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1981.
      <br/>
      It is a characteristic of protective groups that they can be removed easily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions taking place, for example by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or alternatively under physiological conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="92">A protected amino group may be present, for example, in the form of an easily cleavable acylamino, arylmethylamino, etherified mercaptoamino or 2-acyl-lower alk-1-enylamino group.</p>
    <p num="93">
      In a corresponding acylamino group, acyl is, for example, the acyl radical of an organic carboxylic acid having, for example, up to 18 carbon atoms, especially an unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo- or aryl-substituted, alkane-carboxylic acid or an unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-, lower alkoxy- or nitro-substituted, benzoic acid, or of a carbonic acid hemiester.
      <br/>
      Such acyl groups are, for example, lower alkanoyl, such as formyl, acetyl or propionyl, halo-lower alkanoyl, such as 2-haloacetyl, especially 2-chloro-, 2-bromo-, 2-iodo-, 2,2,2-trifluoro- or 2,2,2-trichloro-acetyl, unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-, lower alkoxy- or nitro-substituted, benzoyl, for example benzoyl, 4-chlorobenzoyl, 4-methoxybenzoyl or 4-nitrobenzoyl, or lower alkoxycarbonyl that is branched in the 1-position of the lower alkyl radical or suitably substituted in the 1- or 2-position, especially tert-lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example tert-butoxy-carbonyl, arylmethoxycarbonyl having one or two aryl radicals which are preferably phenyl that is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted, for example, by lower alkyl, especially tert-lower alkyl, such as tert-butyl, lower alkoxy, such as methoxy, hydroxyl, halogen, for example chlorine, and/or by nitro, such as unsubstituted or substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, for example 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, or substituted diphenylmethoxycarbonyl, for example benzhydryloxycarbonyl or di(4-methoxyphenyl)methoxycarbonyl, aroylmethoxycarbonyl in which the aroyl group is preferably benzoyl that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by halogen, such as bromine, for example phenacyloxycarbonyl, 2-halo-lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, 2-bromoethoxycarbonyl or 2-iodoethoxycarbonyl, or 2-(tri-substituted silyl)ethoxycarbonyl in which the substituents are each independently of the others an unsubstituted or substituted, for example lower alkyl-, lower alkoxy-, aryl-, halo- or nitro-substituted, aliphatic, araliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical having up to 15 carbon atoms, such as corresponding, unsubstituted or substituted lower alkyl, phenyl-lower alkyl, cycloalkyl or phenyl, for example 2-tri-lower alkylsilylethoxycarbonyl, such as 2-trimethylsilylethoxycarbonyl or 2-(di-n-butylmethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl, or 2-triarylsilylethoxycarbonyl, such as 2-triphenylsilylethoxycarbonyl.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      In an arylmethylamino group, which is a mono-, di- or especially tri-arylmethyl-amino group, the aryl radicals are especially unsubstituted or substituted phenyl radicals.
      <br/>
      Such groups are, for example, benzyl-, diphenylmethyl- and especially trityl-amino.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      An etherified mercapto group in an amino group protected by such a radical is especially arylthio or aryl-lower alkylthio, in which aryl is, especially, phenyl that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by lower alkyl, such as methyl or tert-butyl, lower alkoxy, such as methoxy, halogen, such as chlorine, and/or by nitro.
      <br/>
      A corresponding amino protective group is, for example, 4-nitrophenylthio.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      In a 2-acyl-lower alk-1-en-1-yl radical that can be used as an amino protective group, acyl is, for example, the corresponding radical of a lower alkanecarboxylic acid, of a benzoic acid that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by lower alkyl, such as methyl or tert-butyl, lower alkoxy, such as methoxy, halogen, such as chlorine, and/or by nitro, or especially of a carbonic acid hemiester, such as a carbonic acid lower alkyl hemiester.
      <br/>
      Corresponding protective groups are especially 1-lower alkanoylprop-1-en-2-yl, such as 1-acetylprop-1-en-2-yl, or 1-lower alkoxycarbonylprop-1-en-2-yl, for example 1-ethoxycarbonylprop-1-en-2-yl.
    </p>
    <p num="97">Preferred amino protective groups are acyl radicals of carbonic acid hemiesters, especially tert-butyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example as indicated, for example 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, or diphenylmethoxycarbonyl, or 2-halo-lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, also trityl or formyl.</p>
    <p num="98">
      The reaction between the derivative of the formula IV and the aniline derivative of the formula V takes place in suitable inert polar solvents, especially alcohols, for example lower alkanols, such as methanol, propanol, isopropanol or especially ethanol or n-butanol.
      <br/>
      In some cases the addition of a solubilizer, such as 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (DMPU), is advantageous.
      <br/>
      The reaction takes place at elevated temperatures, for example in a temperature range from 70 to 150 (degree)  C, preferably under reflux conditions.

      A protected amino group is liberated in a manner known per se and, according to the nature of the protective groups, in various ways, preferably by solvolysis or reduction. 2-Halo-lower alkoxycarbonylamino (where appropriate after conversion of a 2-bromo-lower alkoxycarbonylamino group into a 2-iodo-lower alkoxycarbonylamino group), aroylmethoxycarbonylamino or 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino can be cleaved, for example, by treatment with a suitable chemical reducing agent, such as zinc in the presence of a suitable carboxylic acid, such as aqueous acetic acid.
      <br/>
      Aroylmethoxycarbonylamino can be cleaved also by treatment with a nucleophilic, preferably salt-forming, reagent, such as sodium thiophenolate, and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino also by treatment with an alkali metal dithionite, for example sodium dithionite.
      <br/>
      Unsubstituted or substituted diphenylmethoxycarbonylamino, tert-lower alkoxycarbonylamino or 2-trisubstituted silylethoxycarbonylamino can be cleaved by treatment with a suitable acid, for example formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid; unsubstituted or substituted benzyloxycarbonylamino can be cleaved, for example, by means of hydrogenolysis, i.e. by treatment with hydrogen in the presence of a suitable hydrogenation catalyst, such as a palladium catalyst; unsubstituted or substituted triarylmethylamino or formylamino can be cleaved, for example, by treatment with an acid, such as a mineral acid, for example hydrochloric acid, or with an organic acid, for example formic, acetic or trifluoroacetic acid, where appropriate in the presence of water; and an amino group protected by an organic silyl group can be liberated, for example, by means of hydrolysis or alcoholysis.
      <br/>
      An amino group protected by 2-haloacetyl, for example 2-chloroacetyl, can be liberated by treatment with thiourea in the presence of a base, or with a thiolate salt, such as an alkali metal thiolate, of thiourea, and subsequent solvolysis, such as alcoholysis or hydrolysis, of the resulting condensation product.

      An amino group protected by 2-substituted silylethoxycarbonyl can be converted into the free amino group also by treatment with a salt of hydrofluoric acid that yields fluoride anions.
