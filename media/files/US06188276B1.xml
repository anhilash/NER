      The invention is a linear converter that operates from a single, unregulated power supply to provide voltage gain and power amplification.
      <br/>
      The circuit comprises two pulse-width modulators, two switches, and an inductive element, all of which cooperate to maintain an output voltage in fixed proportion to an input signal.
      <br/>
      According to the invention, an error signal is generated in a resistive divider formed between the input voltage and the output voltage.
      <br/>
      Excursions of this error signal from two fixed voltage references are used by the pulse-width modulators to generate two pulse-width modulated signals.
      <br/>
      One pulse-width modulated signal is generated when the error signal is below one voltage reference, and it drives a switch to inductively increase the output voltage.
      <br/>
      The other pulse-width modulated signal is generated when the error signal is above another voltage reference, and it drives another switch to inductively decrease the output voltage.
      <br/>
      By continuously feeding back the output voltage to the pulse-width modulators in this manner, a linear power amplifier is realized.

    <heading>RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
    <p num="1">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/101,189, filed on Sep. 21, 1998. The disclosure of that application is incorporated rated herein by reference.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to power amplifiers, and more particularly to a push-pull switching power amplifier and converter.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      In a conventional telephone system, a central office provides a ring signal to a telephone set to indicate an incoming call.
      <br/>
      In response to the ring signal, the telephone set produces intermittent, audible tones.
      <br/>
      A typical ring signal is powered by a -48 VDC central office power supply, and is delivered as a sequence of 90 Vrms, 20 Hz, signals across the two electrical connections, a "ring" and a "tip," extending from a central office to a telephone handset.
      <br/>
      This local ring signal must be generated even where digital call signaling is used because telephone sets in a local loop may be designed to respond to the characteristic ring signal.
      <br/>
      Further, the ring signal is used by some telephone sets to directly drive an electro-mechanical ringing device, which places load requirements on the ring signal generator.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      One approach to providing a ring signal is to employ a conventional class D switching power amplifier.
      <br/>
      These amplifiers are efficient; however, they typically require four switching transistors selectively driven by a pulse-width modulated error signal and two transformers.
      <br/>
      They are thus relatively large and expensive.
      <br/>
      Additionally, these amplifiers generally require significant output ripple filtering which adds to cost and complexity.
      <br/>
      The output filter prevents these amplifiers from passing direct current (DC) signals, which presents a further disadvantage where DC signals are desired.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      More specialized circuits have been developed specifically for the generation of analog ring signals from digital inputs.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,555,301 describes a circuit for converting digital call signaling.
      <br/>
      However, this circuit is limited to a uni-polar, approximately square ring signal.
      <br/>
      Another ring signal generator is described in the data sheet for Lucent Technologies' L7590 Telephone Ringing Driver.
      <br/>
      This circuit receives as an input a 100 kHz pulse-width modulated signal, which is converted to a ring signal.
      <br/>
      The L7590 requires two power supplies and an external pulse-width modulator.
      <br/>
      Further, the maximum output excursion from ground is limited by the negative voltage supplied to the circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="6">There is thus a continuing need for a simple ring signal generator which operates from a single power supply and provides voltage gain and power amplification for an analog ring signal.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">In view of the foregoing, the applicant has devised an improved ring signal generator However, as will be clear from the following description, the invention is more generally an efficient, linear power amplifier with broad potential applications.</p>
    <p num="8">
      The amplifier comprises two pulse-width modulators, two switches, and an inductive element, all of which cooperate to maintain an output voltage in fixed proportion to an input signal.
      <br/>
      An error signal is generated in a resistive divider formed between the input voltage and the output voltage.
      <br/>
      The error signal is compared to two fixed voltage references, and the differences are used by the pulse-width modulators to generate two pulse-width modulated signals.
      <br/>
      One pulse-width modulated signal is generated when the error signal is below one voltage reference, and it drives a switch to inductively increase the output voltage.
      <br/>
      The other pulse-width modulated signal is generated when the error signal is above another voltage reference, and it drives another switch to inductively decrease the output voltage.
      <br/>
      By continuously feeding back the output voltage to the pulse-width modulators in this manner, a simple amplifier is realized.
    </p>
    <p num="9">In one embodiment of the invention, the inductive element is a two-terminal inductor</p>
    <p num="10">
      In another embodiment, the inductive element is a power transformer having a primary and a secondary winding.
      <br/>
      One switch is connected to each winding of the transformer such that current pulses may be used to increase or decrease the voltage of the output.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In another aspect of this embodiment, the inductive element is used as an isolation barrier between an input power supply and the voltage output.
      <br/>
      This topology further employs isolation of the feedback error signal to completely isolate the input stage of the amplifier from the output stage of the amplifier.
      <br/>
      This embodiment can be further adapted to provide bi-directional control of the output voltage, that is, the control voltage may be provided from either side of the isolation barrier, or from both sides in combination.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The amplifier can be used as a DC/DC converter by supplying a DC input signal.
      <br/>
      The amplifier can also be used as a ring signal generator to drive a Ringer Equivalent Number load with large signal gain and a characteristic ring signal.
    </p>
    <p num="13">In another embodiment, one of the pulse-width modulators is a variable frequency pulse-width modulator.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an amplifier 10 according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 1, the amplifier 10 includes a first pulse-width modulator and a second pulse-width modulator 14.
      <br/>
      As is known in the art, a pulse-width modulator produces a digital signal that has a duty cycle indicative of an analog input.
      <br/>
      Here, two pulse-width modulators 12, 14 are used to selectively couple an inductive element 16 to an unregulated, direct current (DC) power supply 20, and also to selectively couple the inductive element 16 to ground 30.
      <br/>
      Current is sourced through the inductive element 16 to a load 40 along a path indicated by a first arrow 42, and current is sunk through the inductive element 16 from the load 40 along a path indicated by a second arrow 44.
      <br/>
      A feedback signal is provided along a lead 46 from the output 50 to a control circuit 52.
      <br/>
      The control circuit receives the feedback signal 46, and also receives an input signal 60.
      <br/>
      The control circuit 52 provides signals to the pulse-width modulators 12, 14 in response to the difference between the input signal 60 and the feedback signal from the lead 46 such that a linear relationship is maintained between the input signal 60 and the output signal 50.
      <br/>
      In short, when the input voltage 60 decreases, the first pulse-width modulator 12 is activated to increase voltage at the output 50 (the output is inverted).
      <br/>
      When the input voltage 60 increases, the second pulse-width modulator 14 is activated to decrease voltage at the output 50.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The circuit described above is a linear power amplifier.
      <br/>
      It may be used in power supplies, audio amplifiers, servo actuators, or any other application where an input signal is used to control a voltage applied to a load.
      <br/>
      The following describes in detail a variety of topologies and applications of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 2 shows a detailed circuit diagram of a simple power amplifier 62 according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The inputs to the amplifier 62 are a power source 64, which can be an unregulated DC power source, an input voltage 66, and a ground 68.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      An input resistor 70 connects the input voltage 66 to a first node 72.
      <br/>
      The first node 72 is also connected through a feedback resistor 74 to an output voltage node 76.
      <br/>
      The first node 72 is further connected, through a resistor-capacitor (RC) feedback circuit 78, to a first pulse-width modulator (PWM) 80. The PWM 80 includes an internal voltage reference 82, preferably derived from the power source 64.
      <br/>
      Its output is divided in half to provide a second internal voltage reference 84, which is in turn connected to a first error amplifier 86 at a non-inverting input 88.
      <br/>
      An inverting input 90 of the first error amplifier 86 is connected to the first node 72.
      <br/>
      An output 92 of the first error amplifier 86 is connected through the RC feedback circuit 78 to the first node 72.
      <br/>
      When the voltage at the first node 72 is less than the divided internal voltage reference 84, an output 94 of the first PWM 80 carries a pulse-width modulated signal indicative of the difference, or error, between the divided internal voltage reference 84 and the first node 72.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      An output 96 of the (undivided) internal voltage reference 82 of the first PWM 80 is connected, through a resistor 98 (R1), to a second node 100.
      <br/>
      The second node 100 is connected to ground 68 through a resistor 102 (R2), thus establishing a reference voltage at the second node 100 that is a fixed fraction of the output 96 of the internal voltage reference 82.
      <br/>
      Also connected to the second node 100 is a second RC feedback circuit 104 to a second error amplifier 106 of a second PWM 108.
      <br/>
      A non-inverting input 110 of the second error amplifier 106 is connected to the first node 72, while an inverting input 112 of the second error amplifier 106 is connected to the second node 100.
      <br/>
      The output 114 of the second error amplifier 106 is connected to the second RC feedback circuit 104.
      <br/>
      When the voltage at the first node 72 is greater than the voltage at the second node 100, the output 116 of the second PWM 108 is a pulse-width modulated signal indicative of the voltage difference, or error, between the first node 72 and the second node 100.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      It is possible to use equal reference voltages for both PWM's 80, 108, or for example, to use a single voltage reference to establish the voltage at the non-inverting input 88 of the first error amplifier 86 and the inverting input 112 of the second error amplifier 106.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferred to select resistors 98 (R1) and 102 (R2) such that there is a voltage offset between these inputs 88, 112.
      <br/>
      This prevents the first PWM 80 and the second PWM 108 from concurrently generating "on" signals to the subsequent switching stage of the amplifier.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The bias for the first PWM 80 and the second PWM 108, although not shown on the circuit diagram of FIG. 2, is provided by the power supply 64, for example through a voltage regulator.
      <br/>
      The power supply 64 is also connected to a power input node 118, which includes a bypass capacitor 120 between the power input node 118 and ground 68.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The output 94 of the first PWM 80 drives a gate 122 of a first metal oxide semi-conductor conductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) 124.
      <br/>
      A source 126 of the first MOSFET 124 is connected to a third node 128, and a drain 129 is connected to the power input node 118.
      <br/>
      A first diode 130 is included with an anode connected to the source 126 and a cathode connected to the drain 129.
      <br/>
      The output 116 of the second PWM 108 drives a gate 132 of a second MOSFET 134.
      <br/>
      A source 136 of the second MOSFET 134 is connected to ground 68, and a drain 138 is connected to the third node 128.
      <br/>
      A second diode 140 is included with an anode connected to the source 136 and a cathode connected to the drain 138.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the MOSFET's are well suited to the switching functions of the invention because they have high switching speed and the capacity to carry large currents However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other switching devices may be used, such as simple field effect transistors or bi-polar junction transistors configured as saturation switches, provided the gates are compatible with the signals from the PWM's, and provided the switches can carry sufficient current for linear amplifier operation.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The selection of the first diode 130 and the second diode 140 is important to the proper operation of the amplifier 62.
      <br/>
      The switching speed of the diodes 130, 140 should be an order of magnitude higher than the switching frequency at the MOSFET gates 122, 132 The forward voltage drop of the diodes 130, 140 must be less than the forward voltage drop of the parasitic diodes of the MOSFET's 124, 134.
      <br/>
      Finally, the diodes 130, 140 must have a reverse break down voltage at least as high as the maximum drain to source voltage of the MOSFET's 124, 134.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The amplifier 62 also includes an inductive element 142.
      <br/>
      The inductive element converts current pulses from the MOSFET's 124, 134 into a voltage at the voltage output node 76.
      <br/>
      There is a bypass capacitor 143 between the voltage output node 76 and ground 68.
      <br/>
      A load 144 is connected between the voltage output node 76 and ground 68.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In operation, the MOSFET's 124, 134, under control of the PWM's 80, 108, alternately couple the third node 128 either to ground 68 or to the power supply 64.
      <br/>
      This creates alternating current pulses through the inductive element 142 which result in voltage pulses across the inductive element 142.
      <br/>
      The resulting voltage at the voltage output node 76 is supplied to the load 144, and is also fed back to the first node 72 through the feedback resistor 74.
      <br/>
      By intermittently activating the first MOSFET 124, a buck operation is realized.
      <br/>
      By intermittently activating the second MOSFET 134, a boost operation is realized.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The PWM's 80, 108, together with the MOSFET's 124, 134 and the inductive element 142 provide a large open loop voltage gain from the first node 72 to the output node 76.
      <br/>
      Since, at the same time, the inputs to the error amplifiers 86, 106 are high impedance inputs, the voltage at the output node can be determined by a simple application of Ohm's law to the resistive divider between the voltage output node 76 and the input voltage 66.
      <br/>
      This approximation will be familiar to designers who work with operational amplifiers or other large gain devices, and yields the following relationship:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="27">where</p>
    <p num="28">
      vo is the voltage at the voltage output node 76,
      <br/>
      vref is the voltage of the divided reference voltage 84,
      <br/>
      vi is the voltage at the input voltage 66,
      <br/>
      Ri is the resistance of the input resistor 70, and
      <br/>
      Rf is the resistance of the feedback resistor 74.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      As should be clear from this relationship, the AC gain of the amplifier 62 can be adjusted through a simple change to the feedback resistor 74.
      <br/>
      The AC performance of the above circuit depends substantially on the switching speed of the non-linear components, i.e., the PWM's and the MOSFET's.
      <br/>
      Using PWM's with a switching frequency of five-hundred kilohertz and a twenty volt supply, this topolog demonstrated a -3 dB band width of twenty kilohertz for a fifteen volt, fifteen watt output sine wave.
      <br/>
      To use the amplifier 62 as a DC/DC converter, a constant input voltage 66 can be supplied.
      <br/>
      In this case, line and load regulation will similarly depend on the switching speed.

      FIG. 4 shows an isolation amplifier according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      This isolation amplifier 300 is similar to the amplifier 150 of FIG. 3, with the differences as described below to achieve an isolation barrier 305 between the power supply 152 and the load 266.
      <br/>
      The output stage of the amplifier has a separate ground 310.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The isolation amplifier 300 includes an opto-isolator 312, an external error amplifier 314 with compensation 316, a voltage detector 318, and a voltage reference 320 in the second PWM 200.
      <br/>
      The isolation amplifier 300 receives an isolated negative feedback through the opto-isolator 312 as follows.
      <br/>
      The opto-isolator 312 receives a bias current from the reference voltage 174 of the first PWM 172.
      <br/>
      An output 322 of the external error amplifier 314 provides an input current to the opto-isolator 312, which the opto-isolator 312 converts to an output current.
      <br/>
      This output current passes through a biasing resistor 324 to generate a voltage at an input node 325 to the first PWM 172.
      <br/>
      The output 322 from the external error amplifier 314 is also connected to the voltage detector 318 so that the second PWM 200 can be selectively enabled, using an enable input 326, only when the output from the external error amplifier 314 has a voltage higher than the voltage reference 320 of the second PWM 200.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that the threshold of the voltage detector 318 may be trimmed to obtain a desired time-wise separation between the activation of the first PWM 172 and the second PWM 200.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In operation, the isolation amplifier 300 uses the voltage at the first node 160, which is the resistively divided voltage between the amplifier output 255 and the input voltage 154, to control the PWM's 172, 200.
      <br/>
      When the input voltage 154 decreases, the voltage at the first node 160 decreases below it's equilibrium value, i.e., the voltage at the amplifier output 255 is too small.
      <br/>
      As a result, the voltage at the output 322 of the external error amplifier 314 increases, and this is inverted by the opto-isolator 312 to produce a lower input voltage to the first PWM 172 at the input node 325.
      <br/>
      The first PWM 172 then generates a pulse stream to the first MOSFET 220, which produces current pulses through the primary winding 246 of the transformer 242 resulting in increased voltage at the amplifier output 255.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Conversely, when the voltage at the first node 160 is higher than the inverting node 202 of the second PWM's error amplifier 198, the second PWM 200 is enabled.

      It responsively generates a pulse stream to the second MOSFET 232, which produces current pulses through the secondary winding 224 of the transformer 242 resulting in a decreased voltage at the amplifier output 255.
      <br/>
      It is noted that in this latter state, power is transferred back to the power supply 152.
      <br/>
      While this feature increases efficiency, it requires the addition of over-voltage protection 327 for the input stage circuitry.

      The voltage reference 320 for the second PWM 200 is provided to the inverting input 202 of the error amplifier 198 through a resistor 328.

      The voltage reference 320 is also provided to the external error amplifier 314 by a network consisting of a resistor 330 (R1) and a resistor 332 (R2).
      <br/>
      These resistors 330, 332 establish an offset between a divided voltage node 334 and the inverting input 202 of the second error amplifier 198.
      <br/>
      When the voltage of the first node 160 is between these two voltages, neither PWM 172, 200 is active.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The isolation amplifier 300 also includes a synchronization transformer 340.
      <br/>
      Using the synchronization transformer 340, an output 342 based upon an oscillator (not shown) from the first PWM 172 can be used to synchronize the oscillator from the second PWM 200 across the isolation barrier 305.
      <br/>
      This control is bi-directional and either PWM 172,200 can provide the synchronization signal.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that the PWM's 172,200 can operate without this synchronization, however, the PWM's 172, 200 will generate less noise when modulated with synchronized oscillators.

      An inverting input for the first internal PWM is provided at pin 4, as shown.

      An output of the first error amplifier (pin 5) drives an input resistor 417 (R1) of a second internal error amplifier (not shown) in a second internal PWM, with the second amplifier configured as a unity gain inverting amplifier.

      FIG. 6 shows another embodiment of the ring signal generator 400.
      <br/>
      This embodiment eliminates the diode 228.
      <br/>
      The drain of the second MOSFET 232 is connected, through a resistor 438, to the first tap 252 of the secondary winding 254 of the transformer 242.
      <br/>
      As a result of this arrangement, power is dissipated from the load directly through a power resistor 438 and the second MOSFET 232.

      FIG. 7 shows another amplifier 448 according to the present invention in which one of the pulse width modulators is replaced by a single error amplifier.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term "pulse-width modulator" is intended to include this topology, which provides variable frequency pulse-width modulation of a given input voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The circuit of FIG. 7 operates from a power supply 450, which can be an unregulated DC supply.
      <br/>
      A ground 452 is provided on the power supply 450 side of an isolation barrier 454, and another ground 456 is provided on the output side of the isolation barrier 454.
      <br/>
      A pulse-width modulator with an integrated switch 458 controls the flow of current through a first diode 459 (D1) and a primary winding 460 of a transformer 462.
      <br/>
      The voltage output of the power supply 450 is conditioned by a capacitor 463.
      <br/>
      An input 464 to the pulse-width modulator 458 is controlled by an opto-isolator 466.
      <br/>
      The opto-isolator receives biasing from a first reference 468 on one side of the isolation barrier 454, and from a second reference 470 on the other side of the isolation barrier 454.
      <br/>
      The voltage at the input 464 to the pulse-width modulator 458 is controlled by the voltage at a feedback node 472, as buffered by an error amplifier 474 with feedback compensation 476.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The voltage at the feedback node 472 is determined by a combination of a voltage at an output 478 and a voltage at an input 480 through a resistive divider formed by a first resistor 482 (R1) and a second resistor 484 (R2).
      <br/>
      In operation, when the voltage at the input 480 decreases, and the voltage at the feedback node 472 accordingly falls below the voltage at a first node 486, the pulse-width modulator 458 produces current pulses through the primary winding 460 of the transformer 462.
      <br/>
      This increases the voltage at node 488.
      <br/>
      After conditioning through a first output capacitor 490, an output inductor 492, and a second output capacitor 494, this results in an increase of the voltage applied to a load 496 at the output 478.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      A voltage reference 498 is resistively divided between a third resistor 500 (R3) and a fourth resistor 502 (R4) to provide a constant voltage at the first node 486.
      <br/>
      The voltage reference 498 is also provided, through a fifth resistor 506 (R5) to an inverting input 503 of a second error amplifier 504 (with current established through RC compensation network 505).
      <br/>
      A bypass capacitor 508 (Cref) is connected between the voltage reference 498 and ground 456.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      When the voltage at the input 480 increases, the circuit 448 has a different mode of operation.
      <br/>
      The resulting increase in voltage at the feedback node 472 will raise a non-inverting input 510 of the second error amplifier 504 above the inverting input 503, thus generating a positive voltage at an output 512 of the second error amplifier 504.
      <br/>
      This positive voltage activates a switch 514 which decreases the voltage at the output 478.
      <br/>
      A second diode 516 (D2) is connected between ground 456 and a secondary winding 518 of the transformer 462.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the switch 514, which is shown connected between ground 456 and the node 488, may optionally be connected between ground and a cathode 520 of the second diode 516 using a second switch 522.
      <br/>
      In this case, the first diode 459 (D1) is required because power is transferred from the output 478 back to the power supply 450.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The circuit maintains a linear relationship between the voltage at the input 480 and the voltage at the output 478.
      <br/>
      The relationship is similar to that of Eq. 1, except that the voltage at the first node 486 is derived from the voltage reference 498 through the resistive divider comprising the third resistor 500 (R3) and the fourth resistor 502 (R4).

      FIG. 8 shows an amplifier 600 according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      It is similar to the amplifier of FIG. 7, with the addition of bi-directional control of the voltage at the output 478.
      <br/>
      To achieve bi-directional control, the fixed voltage reference 498 of FIG. 7 is replaced with a voltage derived from a second input 660.
      <br/>
      The output of a buffer 662 establishes a voltage at a node 663, which provides a reference voltage for the remaining circuitry.
      <br/>
      In the circuit of FIG. 8, a second opto-isolator 664 is used to maintain the isolation barrier 454 between the power supply 450 and the output 478.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      A sixth resistor 665 (Ry) provides a ground path for current from a first diode 666.
      <br/>
      The current through the first diode 666 is proportional to the current passing from a third amplifier 672 through an output resistor 676 and through a second diode 678.
      <br/>
      A proportional current is also established through a third diode 680, and a seventh resistor 682 (Rx) provides a path to ground for this current.
      <br/>
      The current through the third diode 680 establishes feedback for linear operation of the third amplifier 672.

      By feeding back current in this manner, good thermal stability can be maintained between the voltage at the second input 660 and the voltage at the node 663.
