    <heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>
    <p num="3">This invention relates generally to techniques for producing interconnecting conductive links and, more particularly, to a unique process for providing conductive links between two conductive materials having a non-conductive material positioned between them.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Configurations of interconnected arrays of conductive elements, as used, for example, in programmable logic gate arrays, requires the formation of conductive links, or paths, between selected conductive elements in a manner which produces relatively low resistance links between them.
      <br/>
      Techniques for producing such low resistance conductive links have been developed using either electrical or laser linking and cutting processes.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The latter laser processes have been preferred for certain applications because they provide permanent links and require no programming wiring or high voltage switching on the chip.
      <br/>
      Laser programmable techniques have the potential for providing higher performance and greater link density than electrical techniques if the linking device itself is sufficiently small.
      <br/>
      Ultimately the minimum size laser link would be a simple crossing of two wires.
      <br/>
      However, up to now insofar as is known, a successful process does not exist for providing such links.
      <br/>
      A primary concern when using any linking technology is the ability to use standard processing for the metal lines on the insulation.
      <br/>
      More specifically, this means the ability to integrate laser restructurable elements using standard silicon based MOS processing without the need to incorporate additional steps.
      <br/>
      Lateral links, which produce conductive links using silicon diffusion, have been used for some time to achieve compatibility with CMOS processing, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,455,495, to Masuhara et al. and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,937,475, issued to F. M. Rhodes et al. on Jun. 26, 1990. These techniques require large areas to focus the laser to the substrate and have high resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Other recent exemplary techniques have been proposed using laser linking processes for interconnecting metal layers at different levels.
      <br/>
      One such technique is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,556 issued on Nov. 24, 1992 to F. Shu et al. in which a laser beam is applied to an upper titanium metal layer at the location at which a link is desired to be made with a lower titanium layer.
      <br/>
      Laser power is supplied at a sufficient level to cause a chemical reduction reaction between the titanium layers and the intermediate silicon dioxide insulating layer so as to produce a conductive compound between the titanium layers which acts as an electrically conductive circuit therebetween.
      <br/>
      Such technique requires additional non-standard process steps and produces high resistance links and, hence, low performance.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,810,663 issued to J. I. Raffel et al. on Mar. 7, 1989 discusses a technique in which a diffusion barrier layer is placed between each metal layer and the insulation layer and the link region is exposed to a low power laser for a relatively long time (i.e., a relatively long pulse width) to cause the metals to alloy with the diffusion and insulating layers to form the desired conductive link.
      <br/>
      Such technique requires a relatively long laser power pulse output using a relatively complicated diffusion barrier/insulation structure so as to produce an opening in the upper layer to permit the energy to be applied to the barrier and insulating layers to produce the desired alloying operation.
    </p>
    <p num="8">A further technique has been proposed to provide lateral links between metals substantially at the same surface or plane as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,636,404 issued to J. I. Raffel et al. on Jan. 13, 1987. Again relatively long pulses are applied to the general region between the metals so as to cause the metals to form an aluminum doped silicon link.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In a recent article "Laserpersonalization of Interconnection Arrays for Hybrid" ASIC's of M. Burnus et al., IEEE International Conference on Wafer Scale Integration, 1993, a laser beam is used to provide sufficient power to blast a hole through an upper metal layer so as to form an opening at the link region.
      <br/>
      Multiple laser pulses of high energy density are used to create the opening and to remove the insulating layer between the metal elements.
      <br/>
      The multiple pulses also produce molten aluminum which spreads along the walls of a crater that is formed when the insulating layer is removed beneath the opening.
      <br/>
      Such aluminum flow along the crater walls produces a tube-like aluminum contact body between the upper and lower aluminum layers.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The article "Laser Programmable Vias for Reconfiguration of Integrated Circuits" by Rouillon-Martin et al. in Optical Microlithography and Metrology for Microcircuit Fabrication, 1989, discloses a technique which performs a similar operation to that discussed in the above Burnus et al. article in which the opening is made much smaller in diameter by using multiple pulses of a relatively highly focused laser beam.</p>
    <p num="11">
      It is desirable to devise a laser linking process which produces a link structure between any two metal layers which can be fabricated in a manner which is compatible with standard MOS processes and which provides high performance (low resistance) and high density (small area) links.
      <br/>
      Such process should use relatively low laser power and provide self-contained links with low peripheral damage at the link sites.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, in a linking process an energy producing device, e.g., a laser, applies a single pulse of sufficient energy to at least one of two conductive materials which are to be linked, and which have a non-conductive material between them, so as to produce mechanical strain in at least one of the conductive materials.
      <br/>
      The strain that is produced initiates a fracturing of the non-conductive material so as to provide at least one fissure therein which extends between the conductive materials.
      <br/>
      The single energy pulse applied by the energy producing device further causes a portion of at least one of the conductive materials to flow in the at least one fissure to provide at least one conductive link between the conductive materials.
      <br/>
      In most cases, an effective fissure extends from a point at or near an edge of at least one of the conductive materials to the other conductive material.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Preferably the non-conductive material is a silicon based dielectric such as silicon oxide or silicon nitride.
      <br/>
      The fracture and conductive link is preferably obtained with a pulse of energy of less than 1 microjoule and a pulse duration of less than 1 microsecond.
      <br/>
      The most preferred pulse duration is in the range of 1 to 10 nanoseconds.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In the preferred embodiment, the first and second conductive materials are metals lying substantially in the same plane and the fissure extends generally laterally between the first and second conductive materials.
      <br/>
      By forming the non-conductive material in layers, an interface between the layers can control the fracturing.
      <br/>
      The fracture may be formed along or be limited by the interface.
      <br/>
      Preferably, an interface of hard material over softer material is provided at a level above the conductive materials.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In another embodiment of the invention, an upper metal layer is deposited on the non-conductive material in a manner so as to provide a preformed opening at the desired link site.
      <br/>
      A single pulse of energy can then be used to be effectively applied to the lower metal layer at the link site so as to produce the mechanical strain required to initiate the fracturing of the dielectric or insulating material, as discussed above.
      <br/>
      In a still further embodiment of the invention, if a preformed opening is used in the upper metal layer, a single laser pulse of energy may be used to provide a desired chemical reaction, or desired alloying, or a desired removal of the dielectric to create a crater therein, without having to produce an opening through the upper metal layer.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, by the use of such a preformed opening a conductive link may be formed from fracturing or from a chemical reduction reaction process, an alloying process, or the flow of metal in a crater formed in the dielectric which has been removed at the link site.
      <br/>
      Thus, in some cases the use of the preformed opening may not require a fracturing of the dielectric material between the metal elements.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In accordance with a preferred implementation of the invention, a first pattern of first preformed conductive elements and a second pattern of second conductive elements are provided on a substrate and lateral conductive links are formed at a single level between selected ones of the first and second conductive elements so as to provide a plurality of desired conductive paths.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term "level" is intended to include embodiments wherein the surfaces of the elements involved in the link lie at substantially the same level, whether or not the elements themselves are formed or deposited on the same planar surface.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment thereof, for example, a first pattern of conductive elements is formed at a first level while a second pattern of second conductive elements is such that it has portions of its conductive elements at two levels, i.e., first portions thereof being at the same level as the first conductive elements and other portions thereof being at another second level below the first level.
      <br/>
      Lateral conductive links are then formed at a single level between selected ones of the first conductive elements and selected ones of the portions of the second conductive elements that are at the same level.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, for example, the first and second patterns of conductive elements are all formed at the same level and lateral links are formed at such level.
      <br/>
      In addition, appropriate cuts can also be made to separate, as necessary, the conductive paths that are so formed.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">
      As can be seen in FIGS. 1 and 2, a lower conductive material in the form of a metal element 10 lies generally in a first plane 11 at a lower level with reference to an upper conductive material in the form of a metal element 12 which lies in generally a second plane 13 above metal element 10.
      <br/>
      In the particular embodiment depicted, a non-conductive (insulating) material 14, such as a glass dielectric, effectively encloses metal elements 10 and 12 and provides a layer 14A thereof between such elements.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention a preformed opening 15 is provided in metal element 12 at the desired link site.
      <br/>
      The metal elements and the insulating material are mounted on a suitable substrate 16 such as a further glass or other appropriate substrate material.
      <br/>
      It is desired to provide an electrically conductive link between the metal elements 10 and 12.
    </p>
    <p num="19">A link site shown in FIG. 3 is similar to that depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, except that the width of the lower metal layer 10 is co-extensive with the width of upper metal layer 12.</p>
    <p num="20">
      As shown in FIG. 3 an energy producing device, such as a laser (not specifically shown in the Figure), is positioned above the link site so as to apply laser energy, depicted by arrows 17, through the structure of FIG. 3. at the opening 15 thereof.
      <br/>
      Such laser energy is applied in the form of a single pulse of energy, as discussed in more detail below.
      <br/>
      The energy of the single pulse so applied is at a sufficient power level that it causes either or both metal elements 10 and 12 to become heated so that mechanical strains are produced therein and both elements thermally expand at portions thereof where the energy is applied, as shown by the exaggerated thermally expanded portions 10A and 12A thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The mechanical strains thereby initiate a fracturing of the glass dielectric material 14 so as to produce one or more fissures 18 therein, particularly in the region 14A thereof.
      <br/>
      While the fissures which are so produced may extend throughout the material 14 one or more of them will extend from metal element 12 to metal element 10, normally one or more of the latter fissures extending from a position at or near at least one edge 19 of metal element 12, as shown by exemplary fissure 18A.
      <br/>
      The laser energy further causes metal from at least one of the metal layers, e.g., the layer with the lower melting point, to flow from such layer into the fissure so as to contact the other layer, as shown.
      <br/>
      Similar fissures and at least one conductive link between layers 10 and 12 would be produced in the structure of FIGS. 1 and 2 as shown by exemplary conductive links 18A in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In a particular embodiment of the invention, used for the link site shown in FIG. 3, for example, a continuous wave argon ion laser was applied to the link site, which had a site area of 4  MU m * 4  MU m and an opening area of 2  MU m * 2  MU m, via a suitable electro-optical shutter, shutter driver circuitry, and associated optical elements, such structures and operation being well known to those in the art.
      <br/>
      The metal layers were separated by a layer of a silicon oxide dielectric having a layer thickness of 0.75  MU m between the metal layers.
      <br/>
      The laser produced single pulses of laser output power of about 1.0 watts having a pulse width from about 1 microsecond ( MU s) to about 3  MU s. The shutter was arranged to provide laser power rise and fall times, i.e., between about 10% to 90% of full power, of about 200 nanoseconds (ns).
      <br/>
      The laser output pulse was formed to provide a minimum beam diameter, through a microscope objective lens producing a 1/e radius of about 1.0 micrometers ( MU m).
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Single pulses of such pulse widths were found to provide a high probability of producing one or more satisfactory conductive links, i.e., a failure rate of less than one in approximately fifty links, in the above embodiment.
      <br/>
      Further increases in the pulse width did not appear to provide any significant improvement in link probability and pulse widths between about 1 to 3 microseconds appeared to be adequate for the structure shown.
      <br/>
      The necessary energy dose was nearly 1  MU juole.
      <br/>
      In some cases it is believed that even smaller pulse widths can be used, e.g., greater than about 1 nanoseconds (ns) so long as they provide sufficient energy to cause the fracturing and metal flow required.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Moreover, in the above described particular embodiment process it was found that using more than a single pulse also did not appear to improve the probability of forming one or more conductive links and that, if a single pulse failed to produce at least one link, the use of additional pulses did not tend to do so.</p>
    <p num="25">
      In the particular embodiment discussed above it was also found that laser output power in a range from about 0.5 to 1.0 watts proved to be sufficient to provide one or more fissures to form the desired conducting links.
      <br/>
      For example, a peak laser output power of 0.72 watts yielded 98.2% out of 1021 link attempts using pulse widths of one microsecond ( MU s).
      <br/>
      The differences in linking probabilities, when the power used was varied from 0.6 to 0.72 watts, for example, using pulse widths of 2  MU s and 3  MU s, appeared to be relatively insignificant.
      <br/>
      It is believed that further improvement will occur by scaling the configuration of FIGS. 1 and 2, for example, to provide a link site area of 4  MU m * 4  MU m, or smaller, such that a failure rate of less than 1 in 10000 links should be achieved.

      Although a laser is the preferred energy source, other energy sources which introduce sufficient thermal energy into the conductive elements to cause the thermal expansion may be used.
      <br/>
      For example, the invention may be implemented in a voltage programmable environment.
      <br/>
      Even where a radiant energy source such as a laser is used, a wide range of wavelengths may be used.
      <br/>
      It is only necessary that the energy be absorbed by the conductive material.
      <br/>
      Absorption can be enhanced by treating the conductive metal layer as by providing a thin titanium layer on the aluminum.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Although a wide range of energy levels and pulse durations may be used, to maintain the fracturing mode of linkage it is important that not too much energy be applied.
      <br/>
      If too much energy is applied, linkage may still result from ablation of the non-conducting layer and the molten flow of metal along the walls of the resultant crater.
      <br/>
      However, such processes have a disadvantage of damaging the upper passivation layer of the structure.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The above dielectric fracturing technique for providing vertical links between upper and lower metal layers can also be used to produce horizontal, or lateral, links between metal elements lying in substantially the same plane, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.
      <br/>
      As seen therein, a pair of separated metal elements 20 and 21 are enclosed in a dielectric (e.g., a silicon based glass or polymer) material 22.
      <br/>
      A laser energy pulse 25 is applied to the region 23 between the metals.
      <br/>
      The laser pulse produces mechanical strains in the metal elements so that they tend to expand so as to provide stresses concentrated at the corners thereof adjacent region 23, as shown by expanded regions 20A and 21A.
      <br/>
      Such expansions initiate a fracturing of the dielectric material 22 so as to produce one or more fissures therein, at least one of which will extend from one metal element 20 to the other metal element 21, as shown by exemplary fissures 24.
      <br/>
      Metal from at least one of the metals will tend to flow through the at least one fissure to form a conductive link between metals 20 and 21, as shown by exemplary fissure 24A.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The lateral link has several advantages over the vertical link.
      <br/>
      With the windowed vertical link of FIGS. 1-3, for example, the laser spot size should be limited in order to pass through the window without being absorbed primarily by the upper metal layer.
      <br/>
      Further, positioning tolerance of the laser is more critical to avoid radiating the upper layer.
      <br/>
      With the lateral link, the spot should be wide enough to heat the metal to either side of the gap.
      <br/>
      Further, because the metal is thermally conductive, the spot size can be considerably larger than the gap size.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the lateral approach is more scalable since the gap size can be made as small as lithographically possible with significant tolerance in laser beam diameter and position.
      <br/>
      Further, the lateral link is particularly suited to applications such as flat panel displays which require a single level of metal.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Another embodiment of the invention can also be used for forming horizontal, or lateral, links between metal elements lying in substantially the same plane, as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9.
      <br/>
      As seen therein, a pair of separated metal elements 40 and 41 are positioned on a first dielectric (e.g., a silicon oxide glass or polymer) material 42 and embedded in a second dielectric (e.g., a silicon nitride glass or polymer) material 43 above the first dielectric material 42.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an interface is formed at the adjacent surfaces of the dielectric materials a portion 44 of the interface being formed between the metal elements 40 and 41.
      <br/>
      Energy in the form of one or more laser pulses 45, for example, is applied generally to the region 46 between the metal elements 40 and 41 particularly so as to be applied to the ends of the metal elements.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The mechanical strength characteristics of the dielectric materials are different and the thermal expansion coefficients of the metal elements are relatively higher than the thermal expansion coefficients of the dielectric materials.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when such energy is applied, thermal energy is absorbed in the metal elements which then expand and produce mechanical stresses therein which tend to be concentrated at stress concentration points, e.g., at the lower corners thereof, at region 46.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As shown in FIG. 9, since the dielectric materials do not expand significantly, the expansions of the metal elements initiate a rupturing at the interface 44 of the dielectric materials which separate at the interface so as to produce a fissure which extends from one metal element 40 to the other metal element 41, as shown by the exemplary fissure 47.
      <br/>
      Molten metal from at least one of the metals flows through the fissure 47 to form a lateral conductive link between metals 40 and 41.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In a particular embodiment such a lateral link was formed, between aluminum elements, in accordance with the technique of the invention discussed with reference to FIGS. 8 and 9, using a diode-pumped Q-switch laser, such as those made and sold by Spectra Physics Laser Diode Systems, Inc. of Mountainview, Calif. under Model 7000 Series designation as an energy supplying source.
      <br/>
      The laser provided pulse energy at about 400 nJ which resulted in a range of usable linking resistances from about 0.5 ohms to about 5.5 ohms was achieved in the formation of over 30,000 links between aluminum alloy elements separated by about 1.0  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="34">While aluminum, or alloys thereof, are found to be effective for use as the metal elements involved, any other metal materials having relatively high coefficients of thermal expansion, e.g., copper or copper alloys, can also be used.</p>
    <p num="35">
      While the use of two dielectric materials having different mechanical strength characteristics has been discussed in the above embodiment, the same dielectric material can be used for dielectric layers 42 and 43, so long as the materials are deposited in layers so that a distinct, interface is clearly formed therebetween.
      <br/>
      Even when the same dielectric materials are so used, a rupturing will tend to occur at the interface 44 so as to form the desired lateral fissure.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      While the dielectric interface is shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 as being adjacent the lower surfaces of the metal elements, the interface can also be arranged to be adjacent the upper surfaces of the metal elements or somewhere in between such upper and lower surfaces.
      <br/>
      Rupturing and the formation of a fissure can also occur in such latter structures to provide the desired lateral conductive link between metal elements 40 and 41.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Moreover, while FIGS. 8 and 9 show the use of two dielectric materials to form a single interface, a pair of interfaces 44 and 49 can be formed using three layers of dielectric materials, as shown in the embodiment of FIGS. 10 and 11. The dielectrics can be different from each other or can be substantially the same, so long as two distinct interfaces are clearly formed at region 46.
      <br/>
      In such an approach the application of laser energy may cause a fissure to be formed at one interface before one is formed at the other interface.
      <br/>
      For example, a fissure 50 can be formed at upper interface 49 from the stress concentration points at the upper comers of the metal elements, prior to the formation of a fissure from the stress concentration points at lower interface 44, as shown in FIG. 11. Accordingly, fissure 50 will produce a conductive link between metal elements 40 and 41 in substantially the same manner as discussed above with reference to the formation of fissure 47.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      A further embodiment is shown in FIGS. 12 and 13 wherein, instead of forming a dielectric interface adjacent the upper surfaces of the metal elements, as in FIG. 10, the dielectric material 43 is deposited on dielectric 48 at a level above such upper surfaces to form an interface 51 at such level.
      <br/>
      When energy is applied generally to region 46 and particularly to the opposing ends of metal elements 40 and 41, mechanical stresses are produced at the stress concentration points, e.g., at the upper corners of the metal elements, which stresses initiating a fracturing of the dielectric material 48 which produces a fissure 52 extending from the upper corners up to the level of the interface 51 so as to be effectively confined to the region at and below interface 51.
      <br/>
      A rupturing at such interface also tends to occur to further enhance the formation of the fissure 52 particularly at and near the region of the interface 51.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, metal flows into such fissure to form a lateral conductive link between metal elements 40 and 41.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      It is preferred that the upper layer 43 be of a harder material than layer 48.
      <br/>
      For example, layer 43 might be silicon nitride (Si3 N4) and the layer 48 might be silicon oxide (SiO2).
      <br/>
      It is a characteristic of multi-layered materials that a fracture which is initiated in a hard material tends to continue on through an adjacent soft material.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a fracture which initiates in a soft material tends to be reflected by a hard material as illustrated in FIG. 13. Thus, the use of a harder material above the softer material tends to limit the vertical extension of the link 52 and any other fractures initiated in the layer 48.
      <br/>
      In fact, this feature is advantageous even where the conductive link 52 does not reach the interface 51.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In another embodiment of the invention, it has been found that the use of a preformed opening, such as preformed in an upper metal layer, will permit the formation of a conductive link between an upper metal layer and a lower metal layer without necessarily requiring a fracturing of the dielectric material therebetween.
      <br/>
      The use of such a preformed opening tends to focus the laser beam energy more efficiently at the link region.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 6, an upper metal element 30 and a lower metal element 31 are enclosed by a dielectric material 32, the overall structure being positioned on a dielectric substrate 33.
      <br/>
      An opening 34 is preformed in metal element 30 prior to the application of any energy thereto.
      <br/>
      A single pulse of laser power 35 applied at the region of the opening 34 can be used to cause the metal near such region to flow into the dielectric region and to alloy with the dielectric material or to produce a chemical reduction reaction with the dielectric material, as discussed above, at the region 36.
      <br/>
      Such alloying or chemical reaction processes cause the dielectric material to become conductive and form a conductive link between metals 30 and 31.
      <br/>
      Because a preformed opening is used, a single pulse of relatively low laser power can be used in contrast with prior art systems where the laser energy must be sufficient to provide the alloying or chemical reaction processes required, which processes tend to result in producing an opening in the upper metal element 30.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Alternatively, if an alloying or chemical reaction process is not used, the use of such preformed opening permits the laser energy to be focused more effectively at the dielectric material so as to remove such material in the region under the opening to expose the laser metal layer to form a crater 37.
      <br/>
      The laser energy also causes the metal from elements 30 and 31 to flow along the sides of the crater that is so formed, as shown in FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      FIGS. 14 and 15 depict an embodiment of the invention wherein a first pattern of first conductive elements 110 of the first pattern is formed at a first level 111 of a dielectric substrate 112.
      <br/>
      Two such conductive elements 110 are shown in FIG. 14 as extending along the same direction, i.e., they are essentially parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      It is clear that FIG. 14 shows only a representative portion of an overall array of such a pattern, the representative portion being along one edge 112A of the substrate, for example, while the overall array extends well beyond that shown in the figure in the directions shown by arrows 113.
      <br/>
      In the particular embodiment depicted, a second pattern of second conductive elements 14 extends in a direction generally orthogonal to the direction of first conductive elements 110, portions 114A of each of which lie at a second level 115 below that of the first level 111.
      <br/>
      Portions 114B of the second conductive elements 114 lie at the same level 111 as the first conductive elements 110, portions 114A and the portions 114B being interconnected by preformed vertical vias 116 at appropriate sides extending between levels 111 and 115 (FIG. 15).
      <br/>
      The second conductive elements 114 are, in the particular embodiment depicted, formed in a generally zig-zag configuration at second level 115 in order to provide for a relatively high density of elements and to permit "cuts" in the conductive elements to be made more readily, as discussed below.
      <br/>
      Portions 114B, in the embodiment depicted, effectively provide conductive portions, or tabs, at the first level 111 which are effectively parallel to portions of conductive elements 110 that are adjacent thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Using the particular configuration depicted in the embodiment of FIGS. 14 and 15, for example, a plurality of conductive paths can be formed as desired by making suitable lateral conductive links at the same level 111 between selected ones of the conductive elements and, if necessary, by making appropriate cuts at selected regions of selected ones of the conductive elements.</p>
    <p num="44">
      One exemplary embodiment of the formation of a conductive path is illustrated in FIG. 16, wherein lateral links 120 and 121 are formed between a first conductive element 110 and adjacent tab portions 114B of a second conductive element 114 so that a conductive path shown by the shaded regions in the figure is formed between the points thereof depicted by arrows 125.
      <br/>
      In addition, a cut is made at region 122 of the adjacent first conductive element 110 to isolate such path from other conductive paths that may be formed.
      <br/>
      The use of the two lateral links 120 and 121 using tab portions 114B at the same level as conductive element 110, as shown, provides for redundancy in the conductive path so as to increase the current carrying capacity and the reliability of the path that has been formed.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, only a single element tab portion 114B may be made available and its associated tab portion as shown in FIG. 16 may be eliminated from the original pattern, in which case the conductive elements can be more densely positioned on the substrate.
      <br/>
      In such case, however, redundant links 120 and 121 cannot be formed so that, while an increased density can be achieved, it is attained at the expense of a possible decrease in reliability.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Another exemplary conductive path shown by the shaded regions between arrows 126 is also depicted in FIG. 16 wherein lateral links 127 and 128 are formed at the same level 111 between a first conductive element 110 and adjacent portions 114B of a second conductive element 114.
      <br/>
      An appropriate cut is made at region 129 of first conductive element 110 to isolate the conductive path from other conductive paths that may be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="46">The above described conductive paths are exemplary only and it would be clear to those in the art from such description as to how other appropriate links and cuts can be used to form a plurality of different conductive paths in an overall array of first and second patterns of conductive elements preformed in a substrate, only a part of which is illustrated in FIGS. 14-16.</p>
    <p num="47">
      A further embodiment of the invention is depicted in FIG. 17 wherein the first and second patterns of conductive elements involved lie at the same level in a substrate.
      <br/>
      Thus, a first pattern of first conductive elements 140 are positioned to lie generally in the same direction and a second pattern of second conductive elements 141 are positioned at the same level to lie in the same general direction so that the conductive elements of each pattern are arranged in an interdigital manner, as shown.
      <br/>
      Appropriate lateral links between selected ones of the conductive element 140 and 141 can be formed at the same level so as to form a plurality of conductive paths as desired, suitable cuts being also made to isolate the paths from each other.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 18, appropriate links 142 and 143 are formed at the same level to provide a conductive path shown by the shaded regions between arrows 145, while appropriate links 146 and 147 are formed at the same level to provide a conductive path shown by the shaded region between arrows 149.
      <br/>
      Suitable cuts as shown at regions 150, 151, 152, 153, and 154 are also provided to isolate such paths from each other.
      <br/>
      It is clear that FIGS. 17 and 18 depict only a part of an overall array of patterns of conductive elements 140 and 141 and it would be clear to the art from the above description that a number of conductive paths could be formed in such an overall array using appropriate lateral links at the same level, as well as suitable cuts as required to isolate the paths from each other.
