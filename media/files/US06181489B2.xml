      <br/>
      A housing assembly includes a combination lens and window retainer, an inner optical lens, an outer optical window and a front cover.
      <br/>
      The retainer includes a middle body structure, a pair of side wing structures, an inner seat and an outer seat.
      <br/>
      The middle body structure has opposite lateral sides, interior portions and exterior portions.
      <br/>
      The side wing structures are attached to and extend in opposite lateral directions from the opposite lateral sides of the middle body structure.
      <br/>
      Each side wing structure has exterior portions.
      <br/>
      The inner seat is defined on the interior portions of the middle body structure.
      <br/>
      The outer seat is defined forwardly of the inner seat on the exterior portions of the middle body structure and of the side wing structures.
      <br/>
      The inner optical lens is mounted to the inner seat of the retainer.
      <br/>
      The middle body structure and side wing structures together define an opening aligned with the inner optical lens and provides an unobstructed forward panoramic field of view through the retainer.
      <br/>
      The outer optical window is sandwiched between the front cover and the retainer and disposed in an overlying relationship to the opening of the retainer.
      <br/>

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention generally relates to a wall mounted motion detection system and, more particularly, is concerned with a combination lens and window housing assembly for a motion detection system and a combination lens and window retainer employed therein for supporting both an optical lens and an optical window in a desired arrangement.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A passive infrared motion detection system detects heat energy radiated or emitted by an object, such as a body of a person, moving across a field of view of a heat sensor, such as a pyroelectric detector, of the motion detection system.
      <br/>
      The motion detection system must be capable of distinguishing between background temperature and a temperature of the moving object which is different from that of the background.
      <br/>
      Thus, the detection system has an electrical circuit operatively coupled to the heat sensor for producing a detection signal in response to the heat sensor detecting a change of temperature as, for example, caused by the body heat of a person entering the detection pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The sensitive area of the heat sensor is too small to detect a significant amount of heat energy radiated from a human body by using the heat sensor alone.
      <br/>
      Thus, the detection system typically employs a lens made up of an array of Fresnel lens segments in a configuration for collecting and focusing a significantly greater amount of heat energy on the heat sensor than would be received using the heat sensor alone.
      <br/>
      A Fresnel lens segment is most efficient when it is flat.
      <br/>
      However, typically a lens array of Fresnel lens segments must be provided in a curved configuration in order to collect and focus the desired amount of heat energy on the heat sensor from a wide angle detection pattern.
      <br/>
      Thus, the lens array of Fresnel lens segments approximate this flatness by being provided as close-to-flat vertical segments arranged in a contiguous side-by-side relationship along a curve of constant radius.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One particular motion detection system is a low profile wide field of view optical system that employs an optical window in front of the Fresnel optical lens.
      <br/>
      The optical window has a relatively large flat main portion with opposite curved end portions.
      <br/>
      The Fresnel optical lens has the aforementioned curved configuration.
      <br/>
      A need exists for a structure to mount and enclose both the optical window lens and Fresnel optical lens in the desired arrangement.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention provides a combination lens and window retainer and housing assembly designed to satisfy the aforementioned need.
      <br/>
      The combination lens and window retainer of the present invention employed in the housing assembly is a single unitary structure.
      <br/>
      The structure defines interior and exterior seats.
      <br/>
      The interior seat is adapted to retain and support an inner optical lens about peripheral edges of the inner optical lens and without obstructing the field of view of the inner optical lens.

      <br/>
      Each of the opposite end ledges 46 of the interior portions 30 forming the inner seat 24 has a substantially curved configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The exterior portions 32 of the middle body structure 20 include a pair of exterior flat surfaces 50 each formed along the peripheral edge 48 of a respective one of the opposite end walls 40 of the middle body structure 20.
      <br/>
      Each of the side wing structures 22 has a pair of opposite end rims 52 and a lateral side rim 54 extending between and connected to the opposite end rims 52 and spaced away from a respective one of the opposite lateral sides 28 of the middle body structure 20.

      <br/>
      Each exterior curved surface 58 of the exterior portions 32 of a respective one of the side wing structures 22 is formed along one of the opposite end rims 52 thereof and extends away from the exterior flat surfaces 56 on the opposite end rims 52.

      <br/>
      Each side wing structure 22 has an overall configuration generally similar to that of the middle body structure 20.
      <br/>
      However, each side wing structure 22 has a size somewhat smaller than the size of the middle body structure 20.
      <br/>
      Also, the middle body structure 20 and side wing structures 22 define a plurality of spaced apart apertures 62 through the opposite end wall peripheral edges 48 of the middle body structure 20 and the opposite end rims 52 of the side wing structures 22 on the opposite sides of the opening 36 therethrough.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Referring again to FIGS. 1 and 2, the inner optical lens 14 overall has a substantially curved configuration.
      <br/>
      As is well-known per se, the inner optical lens 14 is comprised of an array of lens segments 64.
      <br/>
      Each lens segment 64 preferably is a Fresnel type, though may be of any other suitable type, and has a substantially flat configuration.
      <br/>
      Each lens segment 64 has a vertical length greater than its horizontal width.
      <br/>
      The lens segments 64 are arranged in a contiguous side-by-side relationship.
      <br/>
      The curved configuration of the inner optical lens 14 is preferred for collecting and focusing heat energy rearwardly thereof, such as on a heat sensor 66, from a wide angle detection pattern and allows for collecting and focusing a significantly greater amount of heat energy on the heat sensor 66 than would be received using the heat sensor 66 alone.
      <br/>
      The inner optical lens 14 has a pair of opposite substantially straight side edges 68 and a pair of opposite substantially curved end edges 70.
      <br/>
      Each of the straight opposite lateral side ledges 44 of the interior portions 30 of the middle body structure 20 forming the inner seat 24 receives and supports one of the substantially straight side edges 68 of the inner optical lens 14.
      <br/>
      Each of the curved opposite end ledges 46 of the interior portions 30 of the middle body structure 20 forming the inner seat 24, in combination with an adjacent one of the opposite end wall interior surfaces 42 of the interior portions 30 forming the inner seat 24, receives and supports one of the substantially curved end edges 70 of the inner optical lens 14.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The outer optical window 16, being sandwiched between the retainer 12 and front cover 18 when assembled, has a substantially flat main portion 72 and a pair of opposite substantially curved side portions 74 which terminate in opposite side edges 75.
      <br/>
      The flat main portion 72 rests against and contacts the exterior flat surfaces 50, 56 of the exterior portions 32, 34 of the middle body structure 20 and of the side wing structures 22 of the retainer 12.
      <br/>
      The curved side portions 74 rest against and contact the exterior curved and straight surfaces 58, 60 of the exterior portions 34 of the side wing structures 22 of the retainer 12.
      <br/>
      The outer optical window 16 also has a peripheral edge 76 and defines a plurality of spaced apart holes 78 adjacent to the peripheral edge 76 thereof.
      <br/>
      The holes 78 are defined through the substantially flat main portion 72 of the outer optical window 16.
      <br/>
      Each aperture 62 of the middle body structure 20 and side wing structures 22 of the retainer 12 is aligned with one of the holes 78 of the outer optical window lens 16.
      <br/>
      The outer optical window 16 has a size substantially similar to the size of the exterior portions 32, 34 of the retainer 12.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The front cover 18 has a substantially U-shaped configuration in transverse cross-section with a substantially flat main bite portion 18a and a pair of curved side walls 18b.
      <br/>
      The main bite portion 18a of front cover 18 has a plurality of spaced apart couplers 80 in the form of bosses formed thereon and extending rearwardly on opposite longitudinal sides of the window 38 thereof, whereas, a pair of ribs 81 are formed in the inner surface of each of the opposite side walls 18b of cover 18 adjacent to the opposite lateral sides of the window 38.
      <br/>
      Each aperture 62 of the retainer 12 and hole 78 of the outer optical window 16 has a substantially circular configuration.
      <br/>
      Each coupler/boss 80 also has a substantially cylindrical configuration conforming to the configurations of the apertures 62 and holes 78 but slightly smaller in diameter than the apertures 62 and holes 78.
      <br/>
      The couplers/bosses 80 of the front cover 18 align with the apertures 62 of the retainer 12 and the apertures 78 of the outer optical window 16 and the opposite side edges 75 of the outer optical window 16 abut against the ribs 81 on the curved side walls 18b of cover 18 so as to permit the coupling and securing of the front cover 18 with the retainer 12 having the inner optical lens 14 and an outer optical window 16 respectively disposed on the inner and outer seats 24 and 26 of the retainer 12.
      <br/>
      Further, the front cover 18 is mounted to a back base 82.
      <br/>
      The back base 82 has a substantially U-shaped configuration in transverse cross-section and combines with the front cover 18 to enclose the dual lens retainer 12, the inner optical lens 14 and outer optical window 16.
      <br/>
      The back base 82 has the heat sensor 66 mounted thereon such that the heat sensor 66 is positioned centrally in relation to and rearwardly of the inner optical lens 14.
      <br/>
      The back base 82 may be mounted to any suitable external structure.
      <br/>
      The front cover 18 has a pair of opposite end walls 84.
      <br/>
      Each opposite end wall 84 of the front cover 18 defines a plurality of vents 86.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Furthermore, the middle body structure 20 of the combination lens and window retainer 12 has a pair of spaced apart feet or protrusions 88 formed thereon at the opposite lateral sides 28 and rearwardly of the inner seat 24 of the dual lens retainer 12 for contacting a support substrate 90, such as a printed circuit board, and spacing the middle body structure 20 away from the support substrate 90.
      <br/>
      Each protrusion 88 is disposed closer to one than to the other of the opposite end walls 40 of the middle body structure 20.
      <br/>
      Each protrusion 86 has a substantially cylindrical configuration and inner and outer portions with two different diameters.
