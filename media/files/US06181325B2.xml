      A portable computer system enables locating the mouse pointer precisely on the monitor screen.
      <br/>
      The computer system includes a pointing device such as a touch pad mounted at top surface of the main body with two mouse buttons.
      <br/>
      A button is provided at left sides of the touch pad.
      <br/>
      This button is similar to the mouse button and used when fine adjustment of the mouse pointer is needed.
      <br/>
      The operation of the fine adjustment mode performed in the computer are as follows: determining whether a fine adjustment mode selection key is pressed; zooming in a predetermined screen area including current location of the pointer based on the corresponding video driver and operating system; locating the pointer at the desired position within the zoom in screen; checking if the fine adjustment mode has canceled; and restoring the zoom in screen to original picture if the fine adjustment mode is canceled.
      <br/>
      The cancellation of the fine adjustment mode is performed by detecting the signal fed from one of the mouse buttons.

    <heading>CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
    <p num="1">This application makes reference to, incorporates the same herein, and claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. .sctn. 119 from an application for A Computer System With Precise Control Of The Mouse Pointer earlier filed in the Korean Industrial Property Office on Feb. 14, 1997 and there duly assigned Serial No. 4379/1997.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to computer systems, and more particularly to a portable computer system capable of locating the mouse pointer precisely on the monitor screen.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Conventionally, personal computers are equipped with pointing devices as peripheral device for enabling input of coordinate data, selection of a menu, moving of an object, and so forth.
      <br/>
      The typical pointing device may include a mouse, touch pad, track point, track ball, and pointing stick.
      <br/>
      The mouse is widely used in desktop computers for its fine sensitivity and resolution.
      <br/>
      Instead of the mouse, a track ball, track point, and touch pad have been used in portable computers such as a notebook computer for their compactness fit for the smaller size of the portable computer.
      <br/>
      The pointing devices are incorporated into the main body of the notebook computer to perform corresponding mouse function.
      <br/>
      Buttons are provided on the surface of the main body to be pressed or clicked manually and to control certain functions that may be customized to suit the user.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      However, it is common to users of the notebook computers that the use of the track ball or touch pad is inconvenient and less precise compared with the mouse.
      <br/>
      Particularly, it is difficult for a novice to locate a pointer at fine position on screen, since movement of the pointer made by a finger is instable.
      <br/>
      To control movement of the mouse pointer precisely in the notebook computer, either changing the mouse resolution to higher one or adjusting the mouse pointer speed slowly is needed.
      <br/>
      The adjustment of the pointer speed should be performed through the corresponding control program each time it is required to fit for the use.
      <br/>
      Change of the mouse resolution as well as adjustment of the mouse operation is troublesome and time consuming.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,888 for a Method And Apparatus For Improving Visibility And Selectability Of Icons to Selker discloses a display enhancement scheme that expands the size and the selection zone of icons when a pointer falls within a vicinity of the icon.
      <br/>
      This arrangement for enlarging the size of the icons is automatic and does not require the user to press a button or use a complicated display menu to enlarge the size of the icons.
      <br/>
      The enlargement of the icons is out of the control of the user as the user is not required to press any buttons to cause the icon to become enlarged. U.S. Pat. No. 5,187,776 for an Image Editor Zoom Function to Yanker discloses a user controlled ZOOM function that enlarges the region of the screen surrounding the cursor.
      <br/>
      Yanker requires the user to depress CNTR-Z to activate the ZOOM function and the ESC key to deactivate the ZOOM function.
      <br/>
      Yanker uses an image editor to activate and deactivate the ZOOM function.
      <br/>
      What is needed is an arrangement where the user can enlarge the screen in the vacinity of the pointer.
      <br/>
      What is also needed is a single key that both activates and deactivates the ZOOM function.
      <br/>
      Finally, what is needed is the above to be carried out without the use of an image editor.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      FIG. 1 shows a conventional desktop personal computer which employs a mouse as the pointing device.
      <br/>
      The computer 2 includes a keyboard 3 and a mouse 4 as input devices, and a display unit 1 as output device.
      <br/>
      The mouse 4 enables inputting of coordinate data and performing various function supported by related mouse driver programs installed in the computer 2.
      <br/>
      A cursor or pointer is generated and it is presented on the screen of the display 1.
      <br/>
      As the mouse 4 moves on the desktop, the pointer is moved and indicate a position on screen where characters will be inserted or a selection is made.
      <br/>
      Also, buttons are provided in the mouse 4 to be pressed or clicked manually and to control certain functions that are customized to suit the user.
      <br/>
      Most of all, it is important that the mouse pointer should designate a position on screen precisely so that the desired insertion point or selection position may be found.
      <br/>
      The mouse 4 is known to have fine sensitivity and resolution compared to the one mounted in portable computers.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In portable computers, a track ball, track point, and touch pad are used instead of the mouse.
      <br/>
      For example, notebook computers usually adopt the touch pad for its flat and compact structure.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, a notebook computer 100 is provided with a touch pad 200 mounted at top surface of the main body with two mouse buttons 202 and 204.
      <br/>
      A button 300 is provided at left sides of the touch pad 200 in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      This button 300 is similar to the mouse button and used when fine adjustment of the mouse pointer is needed.
      <br/>
      The operation of the fine adjustment mode will be described hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 3 shows a configuration of the notebook computer system with which the pointing device of the invention is incorporated.
      <br/>
      The computer system includes a central processing unit 110, a ROM 120, a RAM 130, an auxiliary storage 150, a video controller 180, and a display unit 190.
      <br/>
      System buses are provided to interconnect the components of the computer.
      <br/>
      The computer system further includes a microcontroller 160 coupled to the system bus.
      <br/>
      Inputs of the microcontroller 160 is coupled to a keyboard 170, a pointing device or touch pad 200, and a fine adjustment mode select button 300.
      <br/>
      The screens of the monitor provide a variable visual display of images and symbols under the control of central processing unit 110.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In this computer system, if the button 300 is pressed, the microcontroller 160 recognizes the signal fed from the button 300 and outputs a signal to the central processing unit 110 notifying that the fine adjustment mode is being invoked.
      <br/>
      Then the central processing unit 110 issues a command that allows the video controller 180 to display screen such that a predetermined area including current location of the pointer is enlarged.
      <br/>
      In this fine adjustment mode, the size of the pointer in the enlarged screen remains unchanged.
      <br/>
      This permits easy location of the pointer at fine position on screen although movement of the pointer made by a finger is instable.
      <br/>
      This will also eliminate change of the mouse resolution or adjustment of the mouse pointer speed.
      <br/>
      Also, the fine adjustment mode is operated by concurrent supporting of the mouse driver, video driver, and operating system in the computer system.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      FIG. 4 shows detailed operation of the fine adjustment mode performed in the computer according to one embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      The fine adjustment mode routine is initiated when the fine adjustment mode select button 300 is pressed.
      <br/>
      At step 120, a determination is made whether the fine adjustment mode is selected.
      <br/>
      If the button 300 is pressed, the central processing unit 110 detects the button signal fed from the microcontroller 160 and recognizes the selection of the fine adjustment mode.
      <br/>
      Then, the central processing unit 110 issues a command that urges the video controller 180 to zoom in or enlarge a predetermined screen area including current location of the pointer based on the corresponding video driver and operating system.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is preferred that the pointer be moved adjacent to the desired position in advance and that the size of the pointer maintain its original size.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Next, locating the pointer at the desired position within the enlarged screen is performed at step 140.
      <br/>
      Once the pointer is moved to the desired position, a selection by the mouse is made by clicking mouse button 202 or 204, dragging the mouse, or double clicking one of mouse buttons 202 or 204.
      <br/>
      After a mouse function has performed, the central processing unit 110 then checks if the fine adjustment mode has canceled by detecting another signal fed from the button 300 at step 150.
      <br/>
      The signal can be generated for example by clicking again the fine adjustment mode select button 300.
      <br/>
      If the cancel signal has detected, the central processing unit 110 urges the zoom in screen to be reduced to its original size at step 160.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIGS. 5A to 5D depict the zoom in screen and pointer location procedure in an application program according to the fine adjustment operation shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5A, provided that the user attempt to locate the pointer P at quit button B30 placed on right edge of a window title bar, the pointer may be moved adjacent to the button area B40.
      <br/>
      Reference numerals B10 denotes iconize button, B20 denotes restore or reduce button, and W10 denotes a tool bar of the application program.
      <br/>
      Mode of the zoom in screen is exemplified by FIG. 5B. Zoom in window W40 is appeared above the button area B40 when the fine adjustment mode selection button 300 is pressed.
      <br/>
      In the zoom in window W40, the region W30 and W20 represent the zoom in title bar and a part of the main window, respectively.
      <br/>
      This is advantageous when the pointer should be located at one of small buttons on title bar in extremely high resolution display status.
      <br/>
      Then the pointer P may be moved exactly to the desired position on the button B30.
      <br/>
      When the mouse button is clicked, the zoom in window will disappear as shown in FIG.
      <br/>
      SD and the pointer P is located in position of the desired button B30 to carry out desired mouse function.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 6 shows another embodiment of the invention representing the operation of the pointer fine adjustment mode.
      <br/>
      As similar to FIG. 4, the fine adjustment mode routine is initiated when the button 300 is pressed.
      <br/>
      At step 220, a determination is made whether the fine adjustment mode is selected.
      <br/>
      If the button 300 is pressed, the central processing unit 110 detects the button signal fed from the microcontroller 160 and recognizes the selection of the fine adjustment mode.
      <br/>
      Then, at step 230, the central processing unit 110 issues a command that urges the video controller 180 to zoom in or enlarge a predetermined screen area including current location of the pointer.
      <br/>
      Also, in this case, the size of the pointer remains unchanged and maintains its original size.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Then, locating the pointer at the desired position within the enlarged screen is possible at step 240.
      <br/>
      Once the pointer is moved to the desired position, a determination is made whether a mouse button 202 or 204 has clicked at step 250.
      <br/>
      If mouse button 202 or 204 has clicked, for example, the zoom in window is restored to original picture at step 280, and subsequently performs corresponding function at step 290.
      <br/>
      If it is found that a mouse button has not been clicked at step 250, the central processing unit 110 then checks if the fine adjustment mode has canceled at step 260 by detecting another signal generated from clicking of the button 300.
      <br/>
      If the cancel signal has been detected, the central processing unit 110 urges the zoom in screen to be restored to original picture at step 270.
    </p>
    <p num="23">As apparent from foregoing, the present invention provides for a precise and easy control of the mouse pointer in the high resolution graphic mode, without changing the mouse resolution or pointer speed.</p>
    <p num="24">
      While the invention has been described in terms of an exemplary embodiment, it is contemplated that it may be practiced as outlined above with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
      <br/>
      For example, the fine adjustment mode selection button 300 can be implemented by designating a function key or a special key combination in a common keyboard.
      <br/>
      Also, it can be configured that the fine adjustment mode is selected in the menu invoked when the mouse right button is clicked.
