      A high-density semiconductor device and semiconductor device array exhibiting high light emission efficiency which can be mass-produced at low cost with high yield is provided.
      <br/>
      An LED array comprises a structure wherein an n-type GaAs buffer layer 102 is formed on an n-type GaAs substrate 101, on which are then stacked an n-type AlzGa1-zAs layer 103, an n-type AlyGa1-yAs layer 104, a semi-insulating AlxGa1-xAs layer 105, and a semi-insulating GaAs layer 106.
      <br/>
      The energy band gaps of the AlzGa1-zAs layer 103 and AlxGa1-xAs layer 105 are at least larger than the energy band gap of the AlyGa1-yAs layer 104.
      <br/>
      A pn junction is formed by selective diffusion, having a diffusion front in the semiconductor layer having the smaller energy band gap sandwiched between the semiconductor layers having the larger energy band gaps.
      <br/>
      The outermost layer forming ohmic contact is made a p-type GaAs region formed by zinc diffusion in a semi-insulating GaAs layer.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention concerns a light emitting semiconductor device, such as a light emitting diode device, and a light emitting semiconductor device array.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">Light emitting diode (LED) devices have been widely employed as display devices for some time because the light which they emit is brilliant, the drive voltage is low, and the peripheral circuitry is simple.</p>
    <p num="5">Conventionally, the LED arrays used in photo printers are such as are disclosed, for example, in Hikari Purinta Sekkei (Photo Printer Design), pp 121-126, ed. by Y. Takekida, Torikeppusu KK, Oct. 31, 1985. Conventionally these have been fabricated by selectively diffusing zinc on a substrate made by epitaxial growth of GaAsP on a GaAs substrate (hereinafter called a GaAsP- substrate).</p>
    <p num="6">
      FIG. 14 is a diagram which models conventional LED fabrication.
      <br/>
      This LED comprises an n-type GaAs substrate 11, an n-type GaAsP epitaxial layer 12 wherein Te is doped and epitaxially grown on the n-type GaAs substrate 11, a p-type GaAsP epitaxial region 13 formed by diffusing Zn, a SiN insulating film 14 which functions as a mask for Zn diffusion, an Al electrode 15, and an Au--Ge electrode 16.
      <br/>
      This LED is structured by the formation of a pn junction by diffusing zinc, which is a p-type impurity, in an n-type GaAsP substrate.
      <br/>
      Junctions having this structure are commonly called homo junctions.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      LEDs structured in this way provide the advantages of requiring comparatively few fabrication steps and of being easy to fabricate.
      <br/>
      In such LEDs as these, the minority carriers injected through the junction recombine with the majority carriers and emit light.
      <br/>
      The wavelength of this emitted light corresponds to the energy band gap of the substrate semiconductor.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the light emitted is affected by large light absorption in the p-type region as it passes through, wherefore the light emission efficiency is not high, which is a problem.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In distinction to LEDs based on the homo junction, as described above, there are LEDs which use a pn junction (hereinafter called a hetero junction) formed by joining a different crystal, such as is set forth, for example, in Hakko Daiodo (Light-Emitting Diodes), pp. 27-31, Okuno, Sangyou Tosho KK, Jan. 20, 1994. As will be described subsequently, the light emission efficiency of an LED can be made higher with a hetero junction than with a homo junction.</p>
    <p num="9">
      FIG. 15(A) is a diagram of the structure of an LED using the hetero structure, while FIG. 15(B) is a diagram of an example of an energy band gap therein.
      <br/>
      FIG. 15 is a diagram of an example of an LED commonly called a single hetero structure (SH structure).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The LED having the single hetero structure shown in FIG. 15(A) is structured with a p-type Al0.35 Ga0.65 As layer 21 epitaxially grown on a p-type GaAs substrate 20, with an Al0.65 Ga0.35 As layer 22 grown epitaxially on top of that.
      <br/>
      Reference numerals 23 and 24 show Au electrodes, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      With this structure, as shown in FIG. 15(B), the positive holes injected through the junction are blocked from diffusing by the energy barrier at the hetero junction interface, whereupon the proportion that recombines increases.
      <br/>
      The wavelength of the light emitted, moreover, corresponds to the energy band gap of the Al0.35 Ga0.65 As layer 21, while the n-type Al0.65 Ga0.35 As layer 22 that forms a light window is larger than the energy band gap of the Al0.35 Ga0.65 As layer 21, so the emitted light is not absorbed in the semiconductor region 22 that constitutes the window.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the light emission efficiency increases.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      LED arrays in which the LEDs described above are integrated are used as light sources in LED printers, for example.
      <br/>
      When an LED array is fabricated by homo junctions, pn junction arrays can be easily fabricated by selective diffusion in which the diffusion into the semiconductor is performed through the diffusion mask openings.
      <br/>
      The fabrication of LED arrays by this selective diffusion is easy, and it is possible to fabricate a super-high-density 1200 dpi LED array.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      With a conventional hetero structured LED such as this, a semiconductor layer having an energy band gap larger than the energy of the light forms a window, so there is no light absorption, and the efficiency with which the light is drawn to the outside is enhanced.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, with an LED array using LEDs of this structure, it is necessary to provide device separation between the devices.
      <br/>
      For that purpose, the elements are separated, for example, by mesa etching.
      <br/>
      This places limitations on the integration density of the LED array.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Thus, in the related art, there is no technology for fabricating LED arrays that exhibit high light emission efficiency and are capable of super-high-density integration.</p>
    <p num="15">An object of the present invention is to provide both a light emitting semiconductor device and a light emitting semiconductor device array that exhibit high light emission efficiency and wherewith high densities can be achieved.</p>
    <p num="16">Another object of the present invention is to provide both a light emitting semiconductor device and a light emitting semiconductor device array that can be mass-produced at low cost and high yield.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      A first aspect of the present invention is a light emitting semiconductor device having the following construction.
      <br/>
      First, a laminated or stacked structure is formed that comprises at least, on a substrate, a semiconductor layer having an energy band gap, and, beneath that semiconductor layer, a first conductivity type semiconductor layer having a relatively smaller energy band gap than that of aforesaid semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      A pn junction face is formed selectively in the first conductivity type semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      In addition, the laminated or stacked structure described above, including the first conductivity type semiconductor layer, contains at least one layer that is a semi-insulating layer of an undoped semiconductor layer.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As based on this light emitting semiconductor device structure, this semiconductor laminated or stacked structure exhibits enhanced light emission efficiency, for the following reasons.
      <br/>
      First, it is a hetero-epitaxial structure.
      <br/>
      Second, injected electrons can be contained or confined between the pn junction face provide din the first conductivity type semiconductor layer and the lamination interface between that semiconductor layer and the semiconductor layer on top of it, whereupon the injection electron density rises, so that the recombination probability increases.
      <br/>
      Third, the wavelength of the emitted light is determined by the energy band gap of the first conductivity type semiconductor layer, but the energy band gap of the semiconductor layer above, which constitutes a light emission window, is large, so the emitted light is not absorbed.
    </p>
    <p num="19">As based on this light emitting semiconductor device structure, moreover, the laminated or stacked structure described above can be formed so as to be thin, and the pn junction can also be formed so that it is locally shallow, so that no wide device separation space is required for forming selectively the pn junction regions in the first conductivity type semiconductor layers, making it possible to raise the light emitting semiconductor device density, but wide device separation space is required for mesa-etched grooves or the like between the light emitting semiconductor devices.</p>
    <p num="20">
      A second aspect of the present invention is a light emitting semiconductor device having the following construction.
      <br/>
      In the first place, a laminated or stacked structure is provided wherein semiconductor layers having energy band gaps are positioned on and beneath a first conductivity type semiconductor layer having a relatively smaller energy band gap than those of aforesaid semiconductor layers.
      <br/>
      A second conducting impurity diffusion region is formed that extends from the upper surface of the outermost semiconductor layer provided above in the laminated or stacked structure to within the first conductivity type semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      In this outermost semiconductor layer, the impurity diffusion region is a semiconductor material wherein an electrode and ohmic contact can be implemented.
      <br/>
      Also, this outermost semiconductor layer is made either a semi-insulating or undoped semiconductor layer, so that no pn junction will be formed inside the outermost semiconductor layer.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As based on this light emitting semiconductor device structure, the laminated or stacked structure exhibits a hetero-epitaxial structure, and injected electrons are contained or confined between a pn junction face formed by the first conductivity type semiconductor layer and the second conductivity type diffusion region and the lamination interface between the first conductivity type semiconductor layer and the semiconductor layer formed thereon.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, injected holes are contained or confined between this pn junction face and the lamination interface between the first conductivity type semiconductor layer and the semiconductor layer formed beneath it.
      <br/>
      Light emission efficiency rises due to two facts, namely, that the recombination probability of the injected minority carriers rises, and that the emitted light is not absorbed because, while the wavelength of the emitted light is determined by the energy band gap of the first conductivity type semiconductor layer, the energy band gap of the upper semiconductor layer that forms the light emission window is larger than the energy band gap of the first conductivity type semiconductor layer that forms the light emission region.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Also, as based on this light emitting semiconductor device structure, the laminated or stacked structure described above can be formed so as to be thin, and the pn junction can be formed so as to be locally shallow.
      <br/>
      In addition thereto, according to the above structure, there is no need for wide device isolation or separation space between the light emitting semiconductor devices, which is quite different from a mesa-etched groove structure requiring wide isolation regions.
      <br/>
      Consequently, according to the above semiconductor device structure, light emitting semiconductor device density can be made high.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Also, as based on this light emitting semiconductor device structure, the pn junction is formed by impurity diffusion, and the structure is such that an electrode and ohmic contact can be effected in the impurity diffusion region of the outermost semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, no special structure is necessary in each device for device separation, which alone makes the structure simpler, and, accordingly, well suited to mass production at low cost and high yield.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      According to a third aspect of the present invention, a light emitting semiconductor device has the following structure.
      <br/>
      That is, the device comprises an underlayer and a laminated or stacked body formed by lamination on the upper surface of the underlayer.
      <br/>
      This laminated or stacked body is constituted by laminating a first semiconductor layer having an energy band gap of Eg1, a first conductivity type second semiconductor layer having an energy band gap of Eg2, and a third semiconductor layer having an energy band gap of Eg3, in that order.
      <br/>
      On or above this laminated body is provided a fourth semiconductor layer that is either semi-insulating or undoped.
      <br/>
      A second conductivity type diffusion region is formed as a partial region or regions, extending from the upper surface of the fourth semiconductor layer into the second semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      A first electrode and a second electrode are provided for injecting carriers into this diffusion region and second semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      These first, second, third, and fourth semiconductor layers, respectively, are formed from compound semiconductors.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the design is made such that, between Eg1, Eg2, and Eg3, the relationships Eg1&gt;Eg2, and Eg3&gt;Eg2 are sustained.
      <br/>
      Also, the diffusion front of the diffusion region described above forms a pn junction face in the second semiconductor layer.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      As based on this light emitting semiconductor device structure, light emission efficiency is enhanced for the following reasons.
      <br/>
      First, the laminated or stacked body (laminated or stacked structure) described above is formed as a hetero-epitaxial structure.
      <br/>
      Second, injected electrons are contained or confined between the pn junction face provided in the first conductivity type second semiconductor layer and the lamination interface between that second semiconductor layer and the third semiconductor layer on it, whereupon the density of the injected electrons rises, while injected positive holes are contained or confined between the pn junction face and the lamination interface between the first conductivity type second semiconductor layer and the first semiconductor layer beneath it, whereupon the positive hole density rises, wherefore the recombination probability of the injected minority carriers is increased.
      <br/>
      Third, the wavelength of the emitted light is determined by the band gap of the first conductivity type second semiconductor layer, but the band gap of the third semiconductor layer on it that forms the light emission window is greater, so the emitted light is not absorbed.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      As based on the construction of this light emitting semiconductor device, moreover, the laminated or stacked body described above can be formed so as to be thin, and the pn junction can be formed so as to be locally shallow, whereupon no wide device isolation or separation space is required between the light emitting semiconductor devices, which is different from a mesa-etched groove structure requiring wide isolation regions between the light emitting semiconductor devices.
      <br/>
      Therefore, according to the above-mentioned device structure of the present invention, higher light emitting semiconductor device density can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      As based on the structure of this light emitting semiconductor device, moreover, the diffusion front of the diffusion region forms a pn junction face within the second semiconductor layer, and the structure is such as to allow an electrode and ohmic contact to be effected in the diffusion region of the fourth semiconductor layer, so no special structure is needed in each device for device separation, making the structure that much simpler.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the construction is well suited to mass production at low cost and high yield.
    </p>
    <p num="28">According to a preferable embodiment of the above-mentioned light emitting semiconductor device, the energy band gap Eg1 may be equal to that Eg2.</p>
    <p num="29">According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, respective light emitting semiconductor device arrays are provided wherein the light emitting semiconductor devices described in the foregoing are formed and arrayed.</p>
    <p num="30">With a light emitting semiconductor device array structured in this way, by making the semiconductor layer below the second semiconductor layer, or the substrate forming the semiconductor laminated or stacked structure either semi-insulating, undoped, or a second conductivity type, it is possible to fabricate semiconductor arrays exhibiting high light emission efficiency which can be matrix-driven.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="32">
      Preferred embodiments of the present invention are now described, with reference to the drawings.
      <br/>
      It should be noted, however, that the drawings are intended merely to represent schematically the shapes, sizes, and positional relationships of the various constitutional components to such a degree as will enable the constitution of the present invention to be understood, and nothing more.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the embodiments described below are simply preferred embodiments, and the present invention is not to be understood to be limited to or by these embodiments.
      <br/>
      In these embodiments, moreover, constitutional examples in which LEDs are used as the light emitting semiconductor device are described.
    </p>
    <p num="33">(First Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 1 is a diagram representing the structure of an LED array to which the first embodiment of the present invention pertains.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a diagram of a cutaway in a cross-section taken from the A--A plane in FIG. 1, being a diagram wherein one device in an LED array wherein multiple LEDs are aligned is focused on, and representing the cross-sectional structure thereof as a model.
      <br/>
      In the following embodiments, the first conductivity type is described as an n-type, and the second conductivity type is described as a p-type.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In FIGS. 1 and 2, an LED 100 comprises an n-type GaAs substrate 101, an n-type GaAs buffer layer 102 formed on the n-type GaAs substrate 101, an n-type first semiconductor layer 103 such as an Alz Ga1-z As layer epitaxially grown on the GaAs buffer layer 102, an n-type second semiconductor layer 104 such as an Aly Ga1-y As layer, a semi-insulating third semiconductor layer 105 such as an Alx Ga1-x As layer, a semi-insulating or undoped fourth semiconductor layer 106 such as a GaAs layer, a Zn diffusion region 107 wherein zinc (Zn) is selectively diffused and locally formed, an inter-layer insulating film 108 comprising an SiN film that constitutes a diffusion prevention mask film for zinc diffusion, a p-side electrode 109, and an n-side electrode 110.
      <br/>
      As is shown in FIG. 2, the zinc diffusion region extends from the surface of the GaAs layer 106, through the Alx Ga1-x As layer 105, to the Aly Ga1-y As layer 104.
      <br/>
      Preferably, moreover, there is present a pn junction face (diffusion front) 120 roughly parallel to the main surface of the substrate 101, i.e. the upper surface 101a, inside the Aly Ga1-y As layer 104.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In the LED 100 of this constructional example, an n-type GaAs buffer layer 102 is formed on the n-type GaAs substrate 101, forming an underlayer 111.
      <br/>
      The structure is such that, on this buffer layer 102, an n-type Alz Ga1-z As layer 103, n-type Aly Ga1-y As layer 104, semi-insulating Alx Ga1-x As layer 105, and semi-insulating or undoped GaAs layer 106 are laminated or stacked.
      <br/>
      The Al ratios of composition for x, y, and z in the compound semiconductor laminated structure or laminated body satisfy the relationships 1 &gt;= x&gt;y &gt;= 0 and 1 &gt;= z &gt;= y &gt;= 0.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Accordingly, layer 104 may be GaAs, and layers 103 and 105 may be AlAs layers.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, when the energy band gaps of the Alz Ga1-z As layer 103 and Alx Ga1-x As layer 105 are made Eg1 and Eg3, respectively, and the energy band gap of the Aly Ga1-y As layer 104 is made Eg2, we have Eg1 &gt;= Eg2, and Eg3&gt;Eg2.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      It is desirable that the size of the energy band gap difference be only sufficient to achieve the effect of containing or confining the injected carriers (electrons and positive holes).
      <br/>
      In this constructional example, this energy band gap difference is made approximately 0.3 eV or higher.
      <br/>
      If we have x=z=0.4, and y=0.15, for example, the energy band gap difference is approximately 0.3 eV. In the laminated structure there is a selectively formed zinc diffusion region 107.
      <br/>
      The diffusion front in the depth direction in the zinc diffusion region 107 is a pn junction face, and this pn junction face is inside the n-type Aly Ga1-y As layer 104.
      <br/>
      Preferably, this pn junction face should be made roughly parallel with the lamination faces in the laminated structure, but is not by any means limited thereto.
      <br/>
      The diffusion will also cross over in the lateral direction, and be formed in directions that are not parallel to the lamination faces, so such formation will also take place in layer 105 and layer 106, but the pn junction is only formed in the Aly Ga1-y As layer 104.
    </p>
    <p num="39">The uppermost GaAs layer 106, moreover, is a layer that covers the Alx Ga1-x As layer in order to form an electrode and ohmic contact.</p>
    <p num="40">
      When the Al composition x is large, Al will be oxidized, making it difficult to form ohmic contact with the Alx Ga1-x As layer.
      <br/>
      Ohmic contact can be formed with GaAs, so it is possible to continually form ohmic contact by covering with GaAs.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      GaAs, on the other hand, has a smaller energy band gap than does Alx Ga1-x As, wherefore, in cases where a pn junction is formed in the GaAs layer, almost all of the current passing through the device will pass through the pn junction in the GaAs layer.
      <br/>
      That being so, in such cases, the emitted light wavelength will be a wavelength that corresponds to the energy band gap of GaAs, and the device will not function.
    </p>
    <p num="42">For the reasons set forth above, providing the GaAs layer 106 elicits two effects, namely that, irrespective of the material making up the layer 105, ohmic contact can be continually formed, and that no pn junction is formed in the GaAs layer.</p>
    <p num="43">In other words, the semi-insulating or undoped GaAs layer 106 is provided so as to achieve the effects noted above simultaneously.</p>
    <p num="44">
      The inter-layer insulating film 108 is provided on the GaAs layer 106.
      <br/>
      This inter-layer insulating layer 108 is provided as a mask for selective diffusion when forming the zinc diffusion region 107 described earlier.
      <br/>
      This inter-layer insulating film is also called a diffusion prevention mask.
      <br/>
      An SiN film, for example, may be used for this diffusion prevention mask 108.
      <br/>
      If the diffusion can be controlled well, some other insulating film such as Al2 O3 or AlN may be used.
      <br/>
      In the LED construction of this example, the semiconductor layer below the insulating layer is a semi-insulating or undoped GaAs layer and, therefore, a high-resistance layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, even if there are some pinholes or flaws in the insulating layer, it is still possible to adequately insulate the n-side semiconductor layers from the p-side electrode 109 that extends over the insulating layer.

    <p num="45">
      On the inter-layer insulating film 108 there is the p-side electrode 109 that is in ohmic contact with the surface of the zinc diffusion region 107.

      <br/>
      The n-side electrode 110 is formed as a common electrode on the back surface of the GaAs substrate 101.

      The operation of the LED 100 constituted as described in the foregoing will now be described with reference to FIGS. 2, 5(A), and 5(B).
      <br/>
      FIG. 5(A) is a model diagram of the laminated or stacked structure portion of the LED device shown in FIG. 2, while FIG. 5(B) is a band structure diagram in a region in the I--I plane of FIG. 5(A).
      <br/>
      Va is the voltage applied to the pn junction.
      <br/>
      In the example structure of the LED array 100 described in the foregoing, layers other than the first conductivity type are formed on the second semiconductor layer 104, so the pn junction is only in the Aly Ga1-y As layer 104.
      <br/>
      That being so, when a current is made to flow in the forward direction between the p-side and n-side electrodes 109 and 110, light is emitted with an energy that corresponds to the aluminum ratio of composition or aluminum mixture ratio y. Electrons injected into the p-type diffusion region 107 cannot diffuse into the Alx Ga1-x As layer 105 because of the barrier (Eg3&gt;Eg2) formed at the interface between the Alx Ga1-x As layer 105 and the Aly Ga1-y As layer 104, and so are contained or confined within the narrow region between the pn junction face 120 and the lamination interface.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the density of the injected electrons will rise, causing their recombination probability to increase, and thus enhancing the light emission efficiency.
      <br/>
      A barrier (Eg1&gt;Eg2) will also exist at the interface between the Alz Ga1-z As layer 103 and the Aly Ga1-y As layer 104, so the positive holes injected into the n layer 104 will also be contained or confined within a narrow region.
      <br/>
      This being so, these contained or confined positive holes will contribute to the enhancement of light emission efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The energy band gap of the Alx Ga1-x As layer 105 is larger than the energy of the emitted light E LAMBDA  being calculated as E LAMBDA  =hc/ LAMBDA , where h is a Plank's constant and  LAMBDA  is a wavelength of the emitted light and c is a light velocity, so the emitted light is not absorbed by the Alx Ga1-x As layer 105.
      <br/>
      If the thickness of the GaAs layer 106 is made thin, moreover, at a thickness of 500  Angstrom , for example, the amount of absorption will be very small, and hence the efficiency with which light is brought to the outside will be enhanced.
      <br/>
      This GaAs layer 106 need only have a thickness that will at least completely cover the upper surface of the layer 105 below it; it may be the thickness of the GaAs crystal laminated or stacked portion, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The zinc diffusion region 107 in the semi-insulating or undoped GaAs layer 106 functions as an ohmic contact layer.
      <br/>
      When the aluminum ratio of composition in the AlGaAs is larger than about 0.2, it is difficult to achieve ohmic contact due to aluminum oxidation.
      <br/>
      However, due to the presence of the p-type GaAs region 121 formed by zinc diffusion (that is, the region of zinc diffusion within the GaAs layer 106), continual ohmic contact can be formed irrespective of the aluminum mixture ratio in the Alx Ga1-x As layer 105.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The semi-insulating or undoped GaAs layer 106 is a semi-insulating semiconductor layer or a high-resistance semiconductor layer having a resistivity &gt;= approximately 107  OMEGA  * cm.
      <br/>
      Therefore, even if zinc is diffused, all that happens is that a p-type conducting layer is formed by the zinc diffusion in the semi-insulating or undoped GaAs layer 106, and no pn junction is formed.
      <br/>
      If the semi-insulating or undoped GaAs layer 106 should happen to be an n-type layer, a pn junction would be formed by zinc diffusion in the layer 106, a current would be injected into the surface GaAs layer, and light emission efficiency would decline.
      <br/>
      Similarly, since the Alx Ga1-x As layer 105 is made semi-insulating, only a conducting layer is formed when zinc is diffused and so there is no contribution made to light emission.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is not necessary to go to the length of providing a structure wherewith current will not flow in the pn junction that is formed by selective zinc diffusion in layers other than the Aly As1-y As layer having a smaller band gap than the Aly Ga1-y As layer (which, in this embodiment example, wherein the outermost layer is not semi-insulating but rather is an n-type GaAs layer, would be the n-type GaAs layer), thus simplifying the device structure, and, hence, also simplifying the fabrication process.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Also, it is possible to contain or confine injected electrons by the barrier at the interface between the Alx Ga1-x As layer 105 and the Aly Ga1-y As layer 104, between that interface and the pn junction face (diffusion front) 120, so they can be made to recombine efficiently even when the distance from the interface between the Alx Ga1-x As layer and the Aly Ga1-y As layer and the diffusion front 120 in the depth dimension is made smaller than the mean free path of the electrons.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it becomes possible to reduce the thickness of the epitaxial layers.
    </p>
    <p num="51">By making the layer thicknesses thin in the semiconductor laminated or stacked structure, and making the selective diffusion depth shallow, it is easy to form device arrays wherein the devices are mutually insulated and thus electrically independent, thus also making it possible to fabricate super-high-density LED arrays such as the 1200 DPI (pitch interval=21.2 microns).</p>
    <p num="52">
      As described in the foregoing, the LED array to which the first embodiment pertains has an n-type GaAs buffer layer 102 formed on an n-type GaAs substrate, and comprises, laminated thereupon or thereabove, an n-type Al2 Ga1-z As layer 103, n-type Aly Ga1-y As layer 104, semi-insulating Alx Ga1-x As layer 105, and semi-insulating or undoped GaAs layer 106.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the energy band gaps Eg1 and Eg3 in the Alz Ga1-z As layer 103 and Alx Ga1-x As layer 105 are made larger than the energy band gap Eg2 in the Aly Ga1-y As layer 104, and a pn junction is formed by selective diffusion having the diffusion front 120 in the depth dimension in the semiconductor layer 104 sandwiched between the semiconductor layers 103 and 105 having relatively larger energy band gaps than that of the semiconductor layers 104.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the outermost layer that forms ohmic contact is made a p-type GaAs region 107 formed by zinc diffusion in the semi-insulating or undoped GaAs layer 106.
      <br/>
      With an LED structure like this, the device structure is simple, and it is possible to implement super-high-density LED arrays that exhibit high light emission efficiency.

      FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of an LED structure in a case wherein the semi-insulating Alx Ga1-x As layer 105 has been replaced by an n-type Alx Ga1-x As layer 201 as the third semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      The band structure of this LED is the same as the LED shown in FIG. 2, so it is represented in FIG. 5(A) and 5(B).
      <br/>
      The n-type Alx Ga1-x As layer 201 has a larger energy band gap than that of the Aly Ga1-y As layer 104, so electrons primarily pass through the pn junction formed in the Aly Ga1-y As layer 104 and are injected into the zinc diffusion region 107.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the Alx Ga1-x As layer 201 does not contribute to light emission, and the light emission wavelength is determined by the energy band gap of the Aly Ga1-y As layer 104.

      An Alz Ga1-z As layer formed by the MOCVD method, for example, when the aluminum content is high, becomes a p-type layer, so the effectiveness is the same as when it is made the p-type as noted above.
      <br/>
      With other materials, in cases of a semiconductor material wherewith a semi-insulating semiconductor layer is obtained by non-doping, the morphology and the device structure will be the same as in the second embodiment described earlier.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      The LED of the third embodiment, as described in the foregoing, is formed as a laminated or stacked structure having, on a semi-insulating or undoped GaAs substrate 301, a semi-insulating or undoped GaAs buffer layer 302, Alz Ga1-z As layer 801, n-type Aly Ga1-y As layer 104, n-type Alx Ga1-x As layer 802, and semi-insulating or undoped GaAs layer 106.
      <br/>
      It also comprises a zinc diffusion region formed by the selective diffusion of zinc from the surface of the laminated structure.
      <br/>
      The diffusion front in the depth dimension in this diffusion region exists in the Aly Ga1-y As layer 104.
      <br/>
      The structure is such that the Alz Ga1-z As layer 801 or 902 is made either p-type or undoped, so the n-type epitaxial layer can be separated into blocks containing a suitable number of pn junctions by the device separation regions 903 that extend to the p-type epitaxial layer.
      <br/>
      This affords the benefit of being able to fabricate an LED array of high light emission efficiency which can be matrix-driven.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      For this third embodiment, an example has been described wherein a semi-insulating or undoped GaAs substrate is used, but it is also possible to use a high-resistance Si substrate, as in the second embodiment.
      <br/>
      An n-type GaAs and a p-type GaAs substrate can be also used instead of a semi-insulating or undoped GaAs substrate, so the n-type epitaxial layer can be separated into blocks by the device separation regions 903 that extend to the p-type epitaxial layer.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      In the embodiments described in the foregoing, examples are described of semiconductor device arrays which are LED array applications using Alx Ga1-x As.
      <br/>
      Needless to say, however, applications are possible in any kind of semiconductor device so long as it be a light emitting device array fabricated by selectively diffusing an impurity of a second conductivity type at least in two epitaxial layers having a different energy band gap from a first conductivity type.
    </p>
    <p num="87">The semi-insulating device arrays to which the foregoing embodiments pertain may, furthermore, have any construction whatever, so long as it embodies one of the structures described, and the manufacturing process therefor, type of substrate therein, number of arrays, or positional arrangement, etc., are not limited to or by these embodiments.</p>
    <p num="88">
      In the embodiments described in the foregoing, the terms "undoped" and "semi-insulating" are employed.
      <br/>
      By "undoped" is meant that there is no doping with an impurity, while by "semi-insulating" is signified a semi-insulating property (resistivity &gt;= approximately 107  OMEGA  * cm) irrespective of whether undoped or doped.
      <br/>
      The undoped GaAs substrates (also called wafers) ordinarily available exhibit a semi-insulating property (resistivity &gt;= approximately 107  OMEGA  * cm).
