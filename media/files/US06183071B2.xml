      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to an ink jet recording apparatus, as well as to a method, for recording information on a recording medium by jetting a recording liquid onto the recording medium.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention is concerned with an ink jet recording apparatus and an ink jet recording method which use, as the recording liquid, a blended ink formed by mixing a plurality of types of ink.
      <br/>
      The present invention is also concerned with an ink supply system.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      In general, conventional ink jet recording systems employ a recording head having a plurality of ink discharge openings from which ink droplets are discharged in accordance with data to be recorded towards the recording medium so as to be deposited on the latter to record the data.
      <br/>
      This type of recording system is used in, for example, printers, facsimile machines and copying machines.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Various ink discharging techniques are available for discharging the ink as the recording liquid.
      <br/>
      For instance, a heat generating element (referred to as an "electro-thermal transducer") in the ink channel near the discharge opening.
      <br/>
      In operation, an electrical signal is applied to the heat-generating element to locally heat the ink so as to generate a bubble in the ink, thereby causing a pressure change in the ink channel to discharge the ink in the form of a droplet.
      <br/>
      Another discharge technique incorporates an electro-mechanical conversion element such as a piezoelectric element.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Techniques are also known for recording halftone images or information using one of the known discharge methods described above.
      <br/>
      For instance, a method referred to as dot-density control method is known in which halftone recording is realized by controlling the density per unit area of dots of a constant size formed by the ink droplets.
      <br/>
      In another method known as dot-size control method, half-tone is realized by controlling the size of the recording dots.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Since the latter method, i.e., the dot-size control method, requires a complicated control to achieve delicate variation of dot size, the former method, i.e., dot-density recording method, is used more broadly.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Recording heads incorporating the above-mentioned electro-thermal transducers can be produced comparatively easily and can perform recording with high level of resolution by virtue of this ability to attain high dot density.
      <br/>
      In this type of recording head, however, it is rather difficult to delicately control the level of pressure generated by the electro-thermal transducer and, therefore, it is impossible to modulate the dot size in accordance with the information to be recorded.
      <br/>
      Consequently, this type of recording head cannot suitably be used in dot-size control type recording operation.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      For the reasons stated above, dot-density control method is used as a primary recording method rather than the dot-size control method.
      <br/>
      The ordered dither method is known as one of the typical binary coding methods for realizing halftone image recording.
      <br/>
      This method, however, has a shortcoming in that the number of levels of tone or gradation is limited by the matrix size.
      <br/>
      That is to say, a larger of matrix is required to obtain a greater number of gradation levels.
      <br/>
      A larger matrix size undesirably increases the size of one pixel of recorded image constituted by one matrix, resulting in problems such as degradation of resolution.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      A conditioned determination type dither method such as the error diffusion method also has been known as another binary coding method.
      <br/>
      The above-mentioned structural dither method is an independent determination type dither method which uses a binary-coding threshold independent of the input pixel, and the conditioned determination dither method varies the threshold level taking into consideration the values of pixels around the pixel in interest.
      <br/>
      The conditioned determination dither method, represented by error diffusion method, is advantageous in that gradation and resolution are made compatible at high levels and in that generation of unwanted moire patterns in the image recorded from a printed image is greatly reduced.
      <br/>
      This method, however, suffers from a disadvantage in that coarseness of recording dots is noticeable particularly in bright regions of the recorded image, thus degrading the quality of the image.
      <br/>
      This problem is serious particularly when the recording density is low.
    </p>
    <p num="12">In order to make the coarseness of dots less noticeable, a recording method has been proposed which employs a pair of recording heads: namely, one for discharging an ink having a low dye concentration, i.e., an ink which is of a comparatively light color and which produces an image of a comparatively low thickness on the recording medium (referred to as "thin ink", hereinafter) and one for discharging an ink having a high dye concentration, i.e., an ink which is of a comparatively dark or thick color and which produces an image of a comparatively thick image on the recording medium.</p>
    <p num="13">
      According to this multi-level tone recording method using plural types of ink having different levels of thickness of the same color, the gradation is improved particularly in the highlighted region of the recorded image when the number of levels is increased, with the result that the coarseness of dots becomes less noticeable, thus improving the image quality.
      <br/>
      This is because the highlighted portion of the image is formed by light color ink dots which are inconspicuous.
    </p>
    <p num="14">FIG. 1A is a schematic perspective view of an example of a conventional ink jet recording apparatus which relies upon the above-mentioned multi-level tone method.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring to FIG. 1A, a carriage 706 carries eight ink tanks 701 containing, respectively, thin and thick ink of black, cyan, magenta and yellow colors.
      <br/>
      The carriage 706 also carries a multi-head 702 having eight heads for discharging these different types of ink.
    </p>
    <p num="16">FIG. 1B illustrates the discharge openings of one of the heads on the multi-head 702, as viewed in the direction of the arrow Z, i.e., from the reverse side of the drawing sheet, of FIG. 1A.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The thick and thin inks of black, cyan, magenta and yellow are represented here by Kk, Ku, Ck, Cu, Mk, Mu, Yk and Yu.
      <br/>
      These discharge openings are arranged in parallel arrays in the direction of the arrow Y. These arrays, however, may be slightly inclined within the X-Y plane.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the discharge of inks from the respective discharge openings is conducted with predetermined time lags or delay, while the head 702 travels in the direction of the arrow X.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring again to FIG. 1A, a sheet feed roller 703 rotates in the direction of the arrow to cooperate with an auxiliary roller 704 in feeding a recording paper sheet 707 in the direction of the arrow y while imparting a certain level of tension to the sheet 707.
      <br/>
      Numeral 705 denotes another sheet feed roller which feeds the recording paper sheet 707 and functions to impart a certain level of tension to the recording sheet 707 in a manner similar to the roller pair 703, 704.
      <br/>
      The carriage 706 is stationed at a home position "h" illustrated by broken line when recording is not conducted and when a discharge recovery operation is being conducted.
      <br/>
      A recovery mechanism (not shown) such as capping means holds the multi-head in a predetermined condition.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The carriage 706 stationed at the home position "h" commences its movement in the direction of the arrow X along a carriage guide shaft 798, in response to a record start instruction.
      <br/>
      During the movement of the carriage, thick and thin inks of four colors are selectively discharged from the n discharge openings 801 of the multi-head 702, based on a carriage position signal which is produced by a linear encoder 709 in accordance with the travel of the carriage, whereby an image fraction of a width corresponding to the width D of the arrays of the discharge openings on the recording head.
      <br/>
      As a result of this scanning operation, ink droplets reach the recording sheets in such an order or sequence of colors that begins with the thick black ink, followed by thin black ink, thick cyan ink, light cyan ink, thick magenta ink, thin magenta ink, thick yellow ink and then by the thin yellow ink, whereby dots of these inks are formed on the recording paper sheet.
      <br/>
      When the recording is finished down to the end of the recording paper sheet, the carriage 706 is returned to the home position "h" and then again commences travelling in the direction of the arrow X. In the period between two successive passes of the head for recording, the sheet feed roller 703 rotates in the direction of the arrow so that the sheet is fed in the direction of the arrow y by a distance corresponding to the above-mentioned recording width.
      <br/>
      Thus, recording over the above-mentioned recording width and sheet feed by a distance corresponding to the recording width are executed in each reciprocating scanning motion of the carriage 706, whereby the data is recorded on the recording paper sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The above-described recording method, which utilizes thick and thin inks, suffers from the following problems to be solved.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Firstly, it is to be pointed out that the described recording method requires the use of two types of ink, i.e., thick and thin inks, for each of the colors to be used.
      <br/>
      For instance, eight types of inks, as well as eight ink tanks, are needed when recording with four colors.
      <br/>
      This undesirably increases the size of the recording apparatus, and poses troublesome complications in the production and administration of the inks.
      <br/>
      In addition, the user is obliged to prepare and store a large number of ink storage and supply means such as ink tank cartridges.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The second problem is as follows.</p>
    <p num="23">
      In general, an ink jet recording apparatus cannot provide image density which is higher than that of a silver salt photograph.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the ink jet recording apparatus is used in a copying machine or the like, it cannot reproduced with sufficient accuracy an original image if a silver salt photograph is used as the original.
      <br/>
      In recent years, performance of host computers connectable to an ink jet recording apparatus has been much improved, and there is an increasing demand for directly printing the image displayed on the display unit of the host computer.
      <br/>
      Known ink jet recording apparatuses cannot satisfactorily cope with this demand because the dynamic range of printed images printed by an ink jet recording apparatus is narrower than that of the image displayed on the computer display.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Ink jet recording apparatuses also suffer from a disadvantage in that, when a thick ink is used in order to attain a high density of recorded image, the ink discharge openings tend to be clogged with the ink which has become viscous or solidified due to evaporation of the solvent, resulting in ink discharge failure.
      <br/>
      Consequently, there is a practical limit in the increase of the ink thickness.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Thus, an ink jet recording system is required to record image with high levels of gradation and resolution within a restricted range of density, because this type of recording system can provide only a narrow range of recorded image density.
      <br/>
      This problem also is encountered in the aforementioned method which employs thick and thin inks.
    </p>
    <p num="26">It is also to be pointed out that the image quality tends to be degraded according to the composition of the solvent used in the ink.</p>
    <p num="27">
      It has been recognized that the quality of print of characters printed by an ink jet recording apparatus also varies largely depending on factors such as the type of the ink, type of the recording sheet and the combination thereof.
      <br/>
      When the ink jet recording method is used for color recording, it is necessary to use expensive special paper in order to obtain a color image of high quality having no bleeding at the boundary between regions of different colors.
      <br/>
      To obviate this problem, a study has been made in recent years to develop inks with which color printing can be done on ordinary paper sheet such as bond paper sheets or copies paper.
      <br/>
      Despite such a development, however, the quality of color printing by ink jet recording method is still unsatisfactory and further improvement in required.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Penetration and spreading of ink droplets on copies or bond paper, as well as some degree of bleeding of colors at the boundary region, can be varied by changing the composition of the solvent used in the ink.</p>
    <p num="29">
      In general, an ink which exhibits a small degree of spreading provides a high density of the dots and, hence, can suitably be used in printing sharp images such as those of characters, thin lines and so forth.
      <br/>
      This type of ink, however, exhibits only a low rate of penetration into the paper, allowing undesirable blurring at the boundary between regions of different colors.
      <br/>
      Conversely, an ink which exhibits a large degree of spreading of dots cannot produce sharp images so this type of ink is not suitable for use in printing characters and thin lines.
      <br/>
      This type of ink, however, is suitable for printing color image because of its lower tendency to blur at the boundary region.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In general, sharpness of characters and thin lines and suppression of blurring at the boundary region are incompatible with each other in the recording on an ordinary paper sheet.
      <br/>
      Namely, an ink which provides high quality of print of character exhibits a large tendency toward blurring at the boundary, whereas an ink which provides clear distinction between colors at the boundary region cannot provide high quality of print of characters.
    </p>
    <p num="31">Thus, no ink has been proposed and used which would enable recording of color images with a high degree of sharpness of characters and thin lines without substantial blur at the boundary between regions of different colors.</p>
    <p num="32">
      It would be possible to prepare two ink tanks: one containing an ink suitable for printing characters and one containing an ink suitable for recording color image, to enable the user to selectively use one of these ink tanks according to the recording purpose.
      <br/>
      Such a solution, however, inconveniently causes user confusion.
    </p>
    <p num="33">Installation of such plural ink tanks in a signal recording apparatus undesirably increases the number of the recording heeds, as well as the number of tanks and associated parts, particularly when a plurality of colors are to be used as in color recording, as is the case of the multi-color printing with thin and thick inks of each color described before.</p>
    <p num="34">The above-described problems are serious, especially in a recording apparatus which, in order to improve gradation, uses plural inks of different dye concentrations for each of plural colors, because such an apparatus requires troublesome work for producing and maintaining inks and ink tanks and undesirably burdens the users due to the necessity of preparing many ink tanks containing different types of inks.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="43">Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="44">(First Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="45">FIG. 2 is a perspective view of an embodiment of the ink jet recording apparatus of the present invention, showing critical portions of the same, while FIG. 3 is a schematic perspective view of a recording head used in this embodiment.</p>
    <p num="46">
      As shown in FIG. 3, a recording head 12 has an array of thick ink discharge openings 2A and an array of thin ink discharge openings 2B.
      <br/>
      The recording head 12 is carried by a carriage 23.
      <br/>
      A recording member P such as a recording paper sheet, shown in FIGS. 2 and 5, or a thin plastic sheet is fed onto a surface opposing the recording head 12 by the operation of a feed roller (not shown), and is moved in the direction of an arrow by the cooperation between the feed roller and paper.
      <br/>
      The carriage 23 is adapted to move while being guided by a guide shaft 22.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the carriage 23 is driven by a carriage motor 25 through a drive belt 24 so as to reciprocally move along the guide shaft 22.
      <br/>
      Heat-generating elements (referred to also as electro-thermal transducers) are arranged in ink channels which are provide in the recording head in communication with respective discharge openings.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The heat-generating elements are driven in accordance with timing read by an encoder (not shown) which is laid along the path of movement of the carriage 23, whereby inks are discharged onto the recording member P thereby performing recording.
      <br/>
      As will be explained later, ink discharge is conducted such that thick and thin inks are adjusted in real time.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      A recovery unit having a cap 26 is disposed at a home position HP which is provided outside the region in which the carriage 23 move during the recording.
      <br/>
      When recording is not conducted, the carriage 23 is moved to the home position HP so that the surface 1 of the recording head 12 in which the discharge openings 2 are formed (see FIG. 3) is capped with the cap 26, whereby the evaporation of solvent is suppressed to prevent clogging of the discharge openings 2 due to thickening of the ink, as well as introduction of foreign matter.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      At the same time, purging discharge may be conducted from the recording head 12 against the cap 26, thereby preventing discharge failure or clogging of a discharge opening or openings which are used comparatively infrequently.
      <br/>
      A suction recovery operation also may be conducted by applying a vacuum between the recording head surface 1 and the cap 26 on the surface 1, thereby sucking and removing thickened ink.
      <br/>
      A wiping blade may be disposed adjacent to the cap 26 so that the surface 1 of the recording head 12 is rubbed and wiped by the blade so as to be cleaned when the recording head 12 is moved.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Supply control units CS1 and CS2 for controlling the ratio of supply of the inks are disposed in the vicinity of the home position HP, in order to control the ratio between the rate of supply of a clear ink containing no colorant and an ink containing a colorant, as will be described later.
      <br/>
      The recording head 12 has supply ports 8 and 7 which are adapted to be connected to certain portions of the supply ratio control units CS1 and CS2 in accordance with the movement of the recording head 12.
    </p>
    <p num="51">FIG. 3 is a schematic perspective view of the recording head 2 as viewed from the underside, i.e., from the same side as the surface 1 having the discharge openings, while FIG. 4 is a fragmentary perspective view schematically showing the construction of the portion of the recording head near a discharge opening.</p>
    <p num="52">
      As will be seen from these Figures, a plurality of discharge openings 2 are formed in the surface 1 of the recording head and ink channels 3 are formed to communicate with the respective discharge openings 2.
      <br/>
      The aforementioned heat-generating elements 4 are disposed in each of the ink channels 3.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 3 and 4, a symbol "y" indicates the direction of the scanning movement of the carriage 23.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The ink channels 3 communicate with a common ink chamber 5 at their ends opposite to the discharge openings 2.
      <br/>
      Separate ink chambers 5 are used for thick and thin inks.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Each common ink chamber 5 is supplied with an ink or inks directly from plural ink tanks (not shown), or indirectly through the supply ratio control units CS1 and CS2, via the ink supply ports 6, 7 and 8.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated embodiment, ink containing a colorant (dye) is supplied through the supply port 6, while ink containing the colorant and a clear ink free of colorant are supplied through the supply ports 7 and 8.
      <br/>
      The ink supplied through the supply port 6 is a thick ink, while the inks supplied through the supply ports 7 and 8 are mixed and stirred in the ink chamber 5 so as to form a thin ink.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The control of the mixing ratio between the ink containing the colorant and the ink free of the colorant conducted by the control units CS1 and CS2 is effected by using manual valves so that the user can mix these inks at any desired mixing ratio.
      <br/>
      This arrangement is advantageously used particularly when the levels of thickness of the thick and thin inks are to be maintained for a predetermined period.
      <br/>
      The supply ports 8 and 7 are brought to positions near the home position in accordance with the scanning movement of the carriage, so as to be jointed to the supply control units CS1 and CS2, respectively.
      <br/>
      During the recording operation, the supply port 6 is held in connection with an ink tank which contains the ink (not shown) containing a colorant.
      <br/>
      Although in the illustrated embodiment the supply of the ink through the supply port 6 is conducted from an ink tank which is mounted separately from the ink tank, the ink tank for supplying the ink via the supply port 6 may also be carried by the carriage.
    </p>
    <p num="56">By recording with the thick and thin inks supplied in the manner described, it is possible to obtain a record image of density levels which satisfies the user's demands or provides an image of the quality required.</p>
    <p num="57">(Modification of First Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="58">A description will now be given of application of the described first embodiment to a color ink jet recording apparatus, with specific reference to FIGS. 5 to 11.</p>
    <p num="59">
      FIG. 5 is perspective view illustrating the critical portion of a color ink jet recording apparatus as a modification of the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      This apparatus operates basically in the same manner as the first embodiment as described.
    </p>
    <p num="60">FIG. 6 is a schematic perspective view of a recording head used in the apparatus shown in FIG. 5, as viewed in the direction opposing the surface in which ink discharge openings are formed.</p>
    <p num="61">
      The carriage 23 carries four recording head 12C, 12M, 12Y and 12K of four colors, i.e., cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y) and black (K), which are illustrated in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Each of the recording heads are provided with an array of discharge openings 2A for discharging thick ink and an array of discharge openings 2B for discharging thin ink of each color.
      <br/>
      The carriage 23 also carries ink tanks 13Y, 13M, 13C and 13K which store inks to be supplied to the respective recording heads.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      In general, when recording with inks of different thickness levels, it is very important that the ink dots of the thick ink and the ink dots of the thin ink are precisely formed with high positional accuracy.
      <br/>
      The density of the image may undesirably deviate when the droplets of the respective inks do not precisely hit the target positions.
      <br/>
      In the first embodiment, as well as in the modification which is being described, discharge openings for inks of different thickness levels of a color are formed in a common recording head so that thick and thin inks are handled in the same recording head.
      <br/>
      This arrangement eliminates miss-registration of ink dots both in vertical and horizontal directions, thus preventing any deviation of density gradation which otherwise may be caused due to offset of the ink droplets from target positions.
    </p>
    <p num="63">FIGS. 7 and 8 are a perspective view and an exploded perspective view showing the detail of the recording head shown in FIG. 6.</p>
    <p num="64">
      Referring to FIG. 7, as in the first embodiment, an ink containing a colorant is supplied through an ink supply port 6 so a to be used as the thick ink, and the ink containing colorant and an ink free of colorant are supplied through the supply ports 7 and 8, respectively.
      <br/>
      The thick ink supplied through the ink supply port 6 is introduced into the common ink chamber for the thick ink, whereas the inks introduced through the supply ports 7 and 8 are mixed and stirred in the thin ink common chamber.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the thick and thin inks are discharged from the openings 2A, 2B in the respective arrays.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      In this modification, the ink tank CIT for colorant-free ink supplied through the supply port 8 is disposed above the home position HP for the carriage 23 as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the carriage 23 is at the home position HP, the ink supply port 8 is connected to the ink tank CIT, so that the colorant-free ink is introduced via the supply port 8 at a rate controlled by the supply ratio control unit CS.
      <br/>
      As stated before, the ink tanks for the colorant-containing ink are carried by the carriage 23 together with the recording heads.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The above-described arrangement of ink tanks can effectively be used when two or more ink tanks are used for colorant-containing inks.
      <br/>
      The recording head is connected by so-called pit-in type connection to the colorant-free ink tank CIT when the head is at the home position, so as to enable a colorant-free ink to be supplied through the supply port 8 for the purpose of adjusting the density level of the thin ink.
      <br/>
      The arrangement, however, may be such that the colorant-containing ink is supplied from an ink tank which is separate from the carriage, through a flexible tube or the like.
      <br/>
      Such an arrangement effectively reduces the mass carried by the carriage.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Referring to FIG. 8, a circuit board 200 is connected at its one end to a wiring portion of a heater board 100 on which the electro-thermal transducers are mounted.
      <br/>
      The other end of the circuit board 200 is provided with a plurality of pads for receiving electrical signals from the main part of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, electrical signals from the main part of the apparatus are supplied in the form of driving pulses to the respective electro-thermal transducers.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      A metallic support 300 which supports the circuit board 200 at its reverse side serves as a bottom plate of the ink jet unit.
      <br/>
      A pressing spring 500 has a portion which is bent in a substantially U-shaped form to resiliently press a region of a grooved top plate 1300 along a line near the ink discharge openings, claws which are to be retained in holes in a base plate, and a pair of rear legs through which the force acting on the spring is borne by the base plate.
      <br/>
      The heater board 100 and the grooved top plate 1300 are resiliently pressed to each other by the force produced by this spring.
      <br/>
      The grooved top plate has an integral orifice plate portion 1301 and channel members 1500 which define channels leading from the ink supply ports.
      <br/>
      The mounting of the circuit board 200 on a support member 300 is by adhesive, using an adhesive or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      An ink supplying member 600 is provided above the grooved top panel 1300.
      <br/>
      The ink supplying member 600 is formed by molding to have a pair of pins (not shown) on the reverse side thereof.
      <br/>
      These pins are received and thermally fused in holes 1901, 1902, thus fixing the ink supplying member 600 to the support member 300.
      <br/>
      The ink supplying member 600 has integral supply ducts 2200a, 2200b and 2200c which correspond to the above-mentioned supply ports 6, 7 and 8, respectively.
      <br/>
      The supply duct 2200a communicates with a central supply duct 2200d of the ink supplying member 600, while supply ducts 2200b and 2200c are commonly connected to the supply duct 220e.
      <br/>
      The supply duct 2200d communicates with a supply port 1500a of the channel member 1500 of the top plate 1300, while the supply duct 2200e communicates with a supply port 1500b.
      <br/>
      Reference numerals 700 denote filters attached to the supply ports 6, 7 and 8 for the purpose of preventing foreign matter and thickened or solidified ink from entering into the respective supply ducts.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      A uniform gap is formed between the orifice plate portion 1301 and the ink supplying member 600.
      <br/>
      A sealant is injected from an upper sealant injection port in the ink supplying member 600 so as to seal wire bonds, while sealing the gap between the orifice plate portion 1301 and the ink supplying member 600.
      <br/>
      The sealant then flows through a groove 301 formed in the support member 300, thereby completely sealing the gap between the orifice plate portion 1301 and the front end of the supporting member 300.
    </p>
    <p num="71">FIG. 9 is a perspective view of the grooved top plate 1300 as viewed in a direction opposing the surface to be bonded to the heater board 100.</p>

      As stated before, two common ink chambers are formed: one for the thick ink and the other for thin ink.
      <br/>
      These common ink chambers 5a, 5b are partitioned by a partition wall 10.
      <br/>
      The ink chambers 5a, 5b are provided with supply ports 20a, 20b through which these ink chambers are supplied with inks.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      A groove 30 is formed in the joint surfaces of the partition wall 10 and the heater board 100.
      <br/>
      This groove 30 makes it possible to seal the peripheral part of the grooved top plate 1300 after it is pressed into close contact with the heater board.
      <br/>
      Namely, the sealant is allowed to flow and spread along the groove 30 so as to fill the gap between the grooved top plate and the heater board.
      <br/>
      It is thus possible to separate completely the common ink chambers from each other by using ordinary technique used in the production of conventional recording head.
      <br/>
      The construction of this groove should vary according to the properties of the sealant.
      <br/>
      It is thus possible to form separate common ink chambers to enable supply of different types of inks to the respective arrays of ink discharge openings.
    </p>
    <p num="74">FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate another example of the arrangement which is adopted when four recording heads are used.</p>
    <p num="75">
      More specifically, FIG. 10 is an exploded perspective view of a four-head ink jet cartridge (IJC) in which four recording heads for four colors, i.e., C, M, Y and K, are integrally assembled by means of a frame 3000.
      <br/>
      The four recording heads are mounted and fixed in the frame 3000 at a constant spacing, with the arrays of discharge openings in registration, i.e, such that the arrays extend exactly in parallel with one another.
      <br/>
      Numeral 3100 denotes a cover of the frame, while 3200 denotes covers which serve also as electrical connectors between the pads provided on the circuit boards of four recording heads and the electrical signal sources provided in the main part of the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="76">FIG. 11 illustrates the manner in which the four-head ink jet cartridge is mounted on the carriage together with the ink tanks containing the inks of the respective colors.</p>
    <p num="77">
      In the first embodiment as described, the color recording apparatus uses two types of inks, i.e., thick and thin inks, for each of four colors such as cyan, magenta, yellow and black.
      <br/>
      This, however, is not exclusive and the color recording apparatus may employ three or more types of inks for each color.
      <br/>
      When a greater number of types of ink are used for each color, the difference in density between the dots of different type of ink of each color is reduced, so that the generation of a false profile, which tends to appear in the boundary region between the thin and thick inks due to non-linear reproduction of gradation, is suppressed.
      <br/>
      The use of three or more types of inks, e.g., thin ink, half-thick ink and thick ink, provides more natural changes in the color tone at the boundaries between the regions of different thickness levels.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Although the first embodiment has been described to use a manual valve type ink supply ratio control unit CS, this unit may be formed by a solenoid valve.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, it is possible to effect a real-time control, i.e, quicker control, of the ink supply ratio, making it possible to correct thickness of the thin ink during recording, i.e., during movement of the carriage.
    </p>
    <p num="79">(Second Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="80">
      A second embodiment of the present invention will now be described.
      <br/>
      The second embodiment also uses a thin ink which is prepared by mixing an ink containing a colorant and an ink which is free of colorant.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      FIG. 12 shows an ink jet recording apparatus as the second embodiment.

      In this Figure, components which are the same as those of the first embodiment are denoted by the same reference numerals and detailed description of such components is omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Referring to this Figure, a carriage 23 carries a recording head 12 and ink tanks 13 which will be described later with reference to FIGS. 23 and 24, respectively.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, therefore, inks are supplied to the recording head 12 from ink tanks carried by the carriage.
    </p>
    <p num="83">FIG. 13 is a perspective view of the recording head used in the second embodiment.</p>
    <p num="84">
      The recording head of this embodiment is substantially the same as those which are shown in FIGS. 3 and 7, which are used in the first embodiment and modification of the first embodiment described before.
      <br/>
      This recording head, however, differs from those shown in FIGS. 3 and 7 in that it employs only two ink supply ducts, i.e., a thick ink supply duct 2200a and a thin ink supply duct 220b, in contrast to the recording heads of the first embodiment and the modification, which employ three ink supply ducts.
      <br/>
      Namely, in the second embodiment, the thin ink is generated by mixing two types of inks in the ink tank as will be described below.
    </p>
    <p num="85">FIG. 14 is an exploded perspective view schematically showing the construction of the ink tank used in this embodiment.</p>
    <p num="86">
      The ink tank has a vessel 130 which is provided substantially at the mid portion thereof with a partition wall 13C so that the space inside the ink tank vessel 130 is divided into a first ink chamber 13a and a second ink chamber 13b.
      <br/>
      The first and second ink chambers 13a and 13b receive ink absorption members 14a and 14b for retaining and supplying inks.
      <br/>
      Foam material such as urethane foam, typically sponge, is used as the material of the ink absorption members 14a, 14b.
      <br/>
      The ink tank 13 is completed by pressing ink absorption members 14a, 14b in the vessel 130 and then pressing and fixing a lid 15 to the vessel 130.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the fixing of the lid 15 to the ink tank vessel 130 is conducted by such a technique which fuses materials of both members, e.g., thermal welding, ultrasonic welding or high-frequency welding, in order to attain required tightness of seal, as well as productivity.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      The lid 15 is provided with holes 15a, 15b for receiving the thick ink supply ducts 2200a, 2200b for supplying respective inks to the recording head.
      <br/>
      Numerals 13a, 13b denote atmospheric pressure ports for maintaining atmospheric pressure inside the first and second ink chambers 13a, 13b.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      FIG. 15 is a top or bottom plan view of the lid 15, with the partition plate 13c combined therewith.
      <br/>
      As will be seen from this Figure, hole 15b of the aforementioned two holes 15a, 15b is divided by the partition plate 13c into two portions which open into the first and second ink chambers 13a, 13b, respectively.
      <br/>
      The areas of the two portions opening into the first and second ink chambers 13a, 13b are different.
    </p>
    <p num="89">Although the hole 15b is divided by the oblique straight partition wall 13c, this arrangement is only illustrative and a partition means which has a stepped cross-section may be used in place of the straight partition wall, as means for dividing the hole 15b.</p>
    <p num="90">The first ink chamber 13a of the ink tank 13 is charged with a thick ink, while the second ink chamber 13b is charged with a colorless ink free of colorant (clear ink).</p>
    <p num="91">The ink tank 13 is then connected to the recording head 12 by means of the ink supply ducts 2200a, 2200b.</p>
    <p num="92">FIG. 16 is a sectional view showing the detail of the structure where the recording head 12 and the ink tank 13 are connected within the hole 15b.</p>
    <p num="93">
      A sponge member 1400, similar to the ink absorption members used in the ink tank, is attached to the connecting end of the ink supply duct 2200b of the recording head 12.
      <br/>
      This sponge member 1400 is held in contact with the ink absorption members (sponge) 14a and 14b in the respective ink chambers of the ink tank.
      <br/>
      The surface of the sponge member 1400 adjacent to the recording head is held in contact with a mesh filter 700 which serves to prevent any foreign matter from coming into the recording head.
      <br/>
      When the recording head 1 and the ink tank 13 are joined together, thick ink is supplied into the recording head through the ink supply duct 2200a which is received in the hole 15c, whereas a thin ink, which is formed from the thick ink mixed and the clear ink at a mixing ratio of 1:2, is supplied to the recording head 12 through the ink supply duct 2200b connected in the hole 15b shown in FIG. 16.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      More specifically, the thick ink and the clear ink are supplied from the first ink chamber 13a and the second ink chamber 13b, respectively, into the connecting region provided in the hole 15b shown in FIG. 16, at a ratio which is determined by the ratio of the opening areas of two portions of the hole 15b defined by the partition wall 13c.
      <br/>
      Both inks are mixed with each other within the sponge member 1400 in the connecting portion so as to form the thin ink having a predetermined uniform thickness.
      <br/>
      This thin ink is then introduced into the common ink chamber inside the recording head 12 through the ink supply duct 2200b.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      In the second embodiment as described, the first hole 15a is not divided so that it supplies only the thick ink.
      <br/>
      This arrangement, however, is only illustrative and may be modified such that the first hole 15a is traversed by the partition plate so that inks from both ink chambers are mixed and supplied through the first hole 15a, as is the case of the second hole 15b.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      The ink supply structure describe hereinbefore supplies two types of inks: namely, a thick ink and a thin ink.
      <br/>
      This arrangement may be modified such that three or more supply holes, having different values of ratios of the area of the openings to both ink chambers 13a, 13b, are used to provide different types of inks having different thickness levels.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      During recording with the thick and thin inks supplied by the described ink supply mechanism, the inks are gradually consumed so that the amount of ink remaining in the ink tank is reduced.
      <br/>
      The user can easily recognize when only small amounts of inks are left in the ink tanks, because under such a condition the color tone is drastically changed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the user can know exactly when to change the ink tank 13.
      <br/>
      Namely, when the amount of the thick ink left in the tank has been reduced, the density of images recorded with the thin ink is lowered, whereas, when the amount of the clear ink remaining in the tank has been reduced, the density of the image recorded with the thin ink is raised.
      <br/>
      Thus, a shortage of the either ink can produce a noticeable change in the density of the recorded image.
      <br/>
      It is therefore possible to avoid dangerous "dry heating", i.e., driving of the electro-thermal transducer 4 with no ink remaining thereon, and this will extend the life of the recording head 12.
      <br/>
      In addition, the cost of the whole recording apparatus can be lowered because there is no need for any means which would be used for electrically or mechanically sensing amounts of ink remaining in the ink tanks.
    </p>
    <p num="98">Although the embodiment has been described with specific reference to a monochromatic recording which uses inks of a single color, it will be clear that the embodiment also can be applied to a color recording apparatus which use thick and thin inks for each of cyan, magenta, yellow and black colors.</p>
    <p num="99">
      Such a color recording apparatus can be realized substantially in the same manner as that of the modification of the first embodiment which was described before with reference to FIGS. 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11, although the construction of the ink tank and the ink supply mechanisms are varied in accordance with the features of the second embodiment described above.
      <br/>
      Such an application of the second embodiment to a color recording apparatus will be described briefly.
    </p>
    <p num="100">FIG. 17 shows a construction similar to that shown in FIG. 8.</p>
    <p num="101">
      Referring to this Figure, filters 700 are installed in the ink supply ducts 2200a, 2200b, and sponge members 1400 are set on the outer side of the filters 700.
      <br/>
      An ink supply member 600 integral has supply ducts 2200d, 2200e which correspond to the supply ducts 2200a, 2200b.
    </p>
    <p num="102">Four recording heads corresponding to four colors of C, M, Y and K, each having the construction shown in FIG. 17, are assembled together by means of a frame 3000 so as to form a four-head type ink jet cartridge (IJC) as shown in FIG. 18. Thus, the construction shown in FIG. 18 is substantially the same as that shown in FIG. 10.</p>
    <p num="103">FIG. 19 shows the manner in which the above-mentioned four-head ink jet cartridge is carried by a carriage, and shows a construction similar to that shown in FIG. 11. Thus, the arrangement shown in FIG. 19 is substantially the same as that shown in FIG. 11. In this arrangement, however, each of the ink tanks has a partition plate 13c similar to that used in the monochromatic ink tank described before.</p>
    <p num="104">With this arrangement, it is possible to determine the thickness level of the thin ink in accordance with the ratio opening areas of the hole formed in the tank between the portion through which the thick ink is supplied and the portion through which the thin ink is supplied.</p>
    <p num="105">(Modification of Second Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="106">FIG. 20 is an exploded perspective view of an ink tank used in a modification of the second embodiment.</p>
    <p num="107">
      The ink tank 13 used in this modification has a negative-pressure generating section which is composed of a pair of ink chambers 13a', 13b' provided with ink absorption members, and ink containing portions 13e', 13f' which are separated from the negative pressure generating section by partition plates 13g', 13h' and communicating with the negative-pressure generating section through notches or slits 13i' formed in the lower ends of the partition plates 13g', 13h'. This ink tank allows a more efficient use of the inks.
      <br/>
      Supply of ink from the ink containing sections 13e', 13f' is commenced after the inks in the ink absorption members 14a', 14b' have been consumed.
      <br/>
      Since the inks are supplied by the static pressure or heads, supply and mixing of inks are achieved more uniformly.
      <br/>
      By setting the level of the gas-liquid exchanging slit 13i' above the level of the ink supply holes 15a', 15b', it is possible to apply a positive pressure to the recording head when the carriage is not used, while ensuring that negative pressure is exerted during operation of the carriage, whereby mixing of inks due to diffusion in both in the first and second ink tanks is prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      An experiment showed that when the level of the slit 13i' is set to range between 2 mm and 10 mm, a water head of 0 to 10 mm Aq is maintained at the ink discharge openings of the recording head.
      <br/>
      This water head or pressure allows an ink meniscus to be maintained in the region near the discharge openings, thus preventing wasteful leakage of the ink from the discharge openings when the recording is not conducted.
    </p>
    <p num="109">There is no restriction in the number of ink colors in this embodiment, as is the case of the first embodiment described before.</p>
    <p num="110">(Another Modification of Second Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="111">
      In the second embodiment and the modification described above, the thick and thin inks of the same color are obtained by suitably selecting the area ratio of ink supply holes provided by partition wall installed in the tank.
      <br/>
      The mixing of the inks, however, can be conducted in various manners.
      <br/>
      FIG. 21 shows another modification of the second embodiment in which the first ink chamber 13a" and the second ink chamber 13b" of the ink tank are respectively charged with yellow and red inks, and three ink supply holes 15a", 15b" and 15c" are arranged in the illustrated manner.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, inks of yellow color, orange color and red color can be supplied through the first, second and third ink supply holes 15a", 15b" and 15c", respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      It is thus possible to obtain an ink of a color tone intermediate between two colors, by charging the two ink chambers with inks of these two colors, instead of obtaining thick and thin inks of the same color.
      <br/>
      Any desired intermediate color tone can be obtained by suitably determining the positions of the partition wall.
      <br/>
      It is thus possible to obtain an additional ink color without increasing the number of the ink tanks.
    </p>
    <p num="113">(Third Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="114">A description will now be given of a third embodiment in which the ratio of supply rate between inks of different thickness levels is varied in accordance with the detected density of recorded image, so as to control automatically the levels of thickness of the discharged inks.</p>

      Ink filling pumps 380 and 384 and main ink tanks 383, 387 (ink cartridges) for supplying these ink pumps with respective inks are disposed on the left and right sides of the apparatus.

      At the home position side, i.e., left aide as viewed in FIG. 28, the sub-ink tanks 378u and 378k carried by the carriage 371 are supplied with clear ink by the ink filling pump 380 via a supply tube 381, whereas, at the opposite side of the stroke of the carriage, i.e., at the right side of the carriage stroke as viewed in FIG. 28, the same sub-ink tanks are supplied with the ink by the operation of the ink filling pump 384, via the ink supply tube 385.

      The construction is materially the same as that of the pump shown in FIG. 29 so that detailed description is omitted with regard to this pump.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted, however, that the rate of supply of the clear ink for a given piston stroke are different from those in the pump shown in FIG. 29.

      FIGS. 31(a) and 31(b) are illustrations of the ink supply tubes used in the ink filling pump.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 31(a), an ink passage opens on the end surface of the tube, whereas, in FIG. 31(b), the ink passage opens at the peripheral surface of the tube adjacent to the end thereof.

    <p num="140">(Construction of Sub-Ink Tank)</p>
    <p num="141">
      FIGS. 32(a) and 32(b) are schematic sectional views showing the construction of a critical portion of the sub-ink tank 378.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent evaporation of the ink from the sub-ink tank 378, the tank structure shown in FIG. 32(a) employs a ball valve 3112 which can block the supply port 3111, while the structure shown in FIG. 32(b) employs a plate valve 3118 for blocking the supply port 3117.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      Referring to FIG. 32(a), when the supply tube of the ink filling pump is inserted into the supply port 3111 of the sub-ink tank 378, the ball valve 3112 is pressed by the supply tube so as to open the supply port 3111.
      <br/>
      Then, as the supply tube is extracted after completion of filling of the ink, the ball valve 3111 is urged by a spring 3119 into contact with the rim of the supply port, thereby closing the latter.
    </p>
    <p num="143">FIGS. 33(a) and 33(b) show sub-ink structures each of which has an overflow port for maintaining a constant ink level in the sub-tank, in addition to the ink supply port.</p>
    <p num="144">This sub-ink structure requires a tube or other means for returning the overflow ink to the filling pump.</p>
    <p num="145">In order to prevent evaporation of the ink in the sub-ink tank 378, the structure shown in FIG. 33(a) employs ball valves 3125 for closing the supply port 3124 and the overflow port 3123, while the structure shown in FIG. 33(b) employs plate valves 3133 for closing the supply port 3132 and the overflow port 3131.</p>
    <p num="146">
      Referring to FIG. 33(a), when the ink supply tube and the overflow tube are inserted into an ink supply port 3124 and overflow port 3123, the ball valves 3125 are displaced by these tubes so that the supply port and the overflow port are opened.
      <br/>
      After the completion of supply of the ink, the supply tube and the overflow tube are extracted from the respective ports, so that the ball valves 3125 are returned by the force of the springs 3126 so as to close the supply and overflow ports again.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      Referring now to FIG. 33(b), when the supply tube and the overflow tube of the ink filling port are inserted into the supply and overflow ports in the sub-ink tank, the valve member is displaced by these tubes so as to open the supply port 3131 and the overflow port 3132.
      <br/>
      After the completion of filling of the sub-ink tank, the supply tube and the overflow tube are extracted so that the valves 3133 are returned by the force of the springs 3134 so as to close the supply and overflow ports again.
    </p>
    <p num="148">Considering the manner of contact between the end of the ink supply tube and the valve member, the sub-ink tank structures shown in FIGS. 32(a) and 32(b) are preferably used in combination with the tube structure shown in FIG. 31(a), while the sub-ink tank structures shown in FIGS. 31A and 32(a) are used in combination with the tube structure shown in FIG. 31(b).</p>
    <p num="149">(Recording Head)</p>
    <p num="150">
      The recording head used in this embodiment has, for example, a construction similar to that shown in FIG. 17. The description of the recording head is therefore omitted.
      <br/>
      The structure of the grooved top plate also is similar to that shown in FIG. 9 having ink chambers or thick and thin inks and, therefore, detailed description is omitted also in this connection.
    </p>
    <p num="151">(Construction of Ink Discharge Opening Array and Example of Image Recorded)</p>
    <p num="152">FIG. 34 is a plan view of the recording head as viewed in the direction opposing the surface having arrays of ink discharge openings.</p>
    <p num="153">As in the case of each of the preceding embodiments, an array for thick black ink and an array for thin black ink are arranged in series in each recording head.</p>
    <p num="154">
      More specifically, the recording head 370 has an array 371K KAPPA  of discharge openings for thick black ink and an array 371Ku of discharge openings for thin black ink.
      <br/>
      These arrays 371Kk, 371Ku are arranged in series and each of these arrays has 32 discharge openings arranged at a pitch of 360 dpi.
      <br/>
      These arrays are separated from each other by a wall of the ink chamber which has a thickness corresponding to eight pitches of the discharge openings.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      FIG. 35 is a schematic illustration of the process for forming an image in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      In the following description of the recording operation, an assumption is made that there is no spacing between the arrays of discharge openings for thick and thin inks.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      Recording of the (N+1)h line, for example, is conducted by the following method.
      <br/>
      In the first scanning operation, recording with the thick black ink is performed followed by a feed of the recording member by a predetermined feed length (referred to as "line feed LF").
      <br/>
      In a second scanning, recording is performed with thin black ink, followed by a line feed LF, whereby the image of the (N+1)th line is completely formed.
      <br/>
      The amount of each line feed LF corresponds to 32 dots.
      <br/>
      Thus, an image portion having a width corresponding to 32 dots is formed by two successive scanning cycles performed by the recording head.
    </p>
    <p num="157">In the recording operation as described, only one type of ink is used in a single cycle of scanning performed by the recording head, so that image is recorded with excellent quality without being affected by blur which otherwise may occur due to interference between two types of inks.</p>
    <p num="158">
      In the described embodiment, the recording head has ink discharge opening arrays formed in the same surface of the head for discharging inks of different thickness levels supplied from separate common ink chambers.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, it is possible to reduce the number of recording heads to be employed, thus contributing to reduction in the size of the recording apparatus.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the recording head used in this embodiment eliminates the necessity for a high degree of precision of dot position control or a complicated position correcting operation which hitherto have been necessary, by virtue of the fact that the arrays of discharge openings can be formed with a high degree of positional and dimensional precision, with a reduced cost, thus further contributing to reduction in the cost of production of the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      From the viewpoint of need for correction of ink discharging timing, it is preferred that the arrays of the discharge openings be arranged on a common straight line.
      <br/>
      Such an arrangement of the ink discharge openings, however, is not mandatory and the arrangement may be modified such that the arrays of discharge openings for discharging inks of different thickness levels are disposed side by side or in a staggered manner.
      <br/>
      The arrangement also may be such that the arrays for discharging inks of different thickness levels employ different numbers of ink discharge openings.
    </p>
    <p num="160">(Ink Supply Operation)</p>
    <p num="161">FIG. 36 is a flow chart illustrating the ink supply process for varying the thickness level of the ink in the described embodiment.</p>
    <p num="162">This ink supply process includes histogram processing 322, ink mixing ratio determination 323 and ink mixing control 324, which are shown in FIG. 23.</p>
    <p num="163">
      As the process is started, image distribution is detected from the record data in Step S130.
      <br/>
      Then, in Step S131, whether the ink thickness level is to be changed is determined by the ink mixing ratio determination function 323, based on the density distribution of an image to be recorded as detected by the histogram processing function 322.
      <br/>
      When Step S131 has determined that the ink thickness level is to be changed.
      <br/>
      Steps S132, S133 and S134 are sequentially executed to move the carriage 371 to the left end of the apparatus to bring the supply tubes 381 of the pump into connection with the sub-tanks 378u, 378k.
      <br/>
      Then, Step S135 is executed to control the amount of movement of the carriage, in accordance with the amount of the clear ink to be supplied.
    </p>
    <p num="164">After completion of the routine for supplying the clear ink, Steps S136 to S139 are sequentially executed so that the carriage 371 is moved to the right end of the apparatus, where a control similar to that for the supply of clear ink is performed so as to supply thick and thin inks, so that the thin and thick inks are mixed with the clear ink within the sub-ink tanks 378u, 378k, whereby thick and thin inks are prepared to have desired levels of thickness.</p>
    <p num="165">After completion of the thickness changing operation described above, Steps S140 and S141 are executed to bring the carriage 371 back to a predetermined position, followed by execution of Step S142 in which the carriage is stationed for the recording operation.</p>
    <p num="166">
      In the third embodiment of the invention, by virtue of the construction described before, inks of desired thickness levels can be obtained through the mixing, thus attaining an image which excels in gradation.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since either one of thick and thin inks is used in each cycle of scan performed by the recording head, any blur which otherwise may be caused by overlap or interference of dots of different inks is avoided, whereby a high quality recorded image can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="167">(Modification of Third Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="168">As in the first and second embodiments described before, the third embodiment can be applied to a color ink jet recording apparatus which uses four types of inks having different colors.</p>
    <p num="169">A color ink jet recording apparatus as a modification of the third embodiment will be described with reference to FIGS. 37 to 42. The following description will be focused mainly on the points which distinguish the modification from the third embodiment.</p>
    <p num="170">Referring to FIG. 37, a ROM 484 includes an input/output  GAMMA  conversion table 484a which is referred to in the processing performed by the input/output  GAMMA  conversion circuit, masking coefficient table 484b which is referred to in the processing performed by a color correction (masking) circuit, black generation and UCR table 484c which is referred to in processing performed by black generation and UCR circuits, a thick/thin sorting table 484d which is referred to in the processing performed by the thick/thin sorting circuit, and various programs 484e.</p>
    <p num="171">
      FIG. 38 shows the image signal processing section of this embodiment.
      <br/>
      Image signals R, G and B corresponding to red, green and blue colors are respectively converted into image density signals of cyan, magenta and yellow colors, through the input  GAMMA  correction circuit 494.
      <br/>
      After processing through the color correction (masking) circuit 495 and the black generation/UCR (Under Color Removal) circuit 496, the signals are converted into image density signals of cyan, magenta, yellow and black.
      <br/>
      Then, an output  GAMMA  correction is effected on these signals through the output  GAMMA  correction circuit 497.
      <br/>
      The cyan, magenta, yellow and black image density signals are then processed through the thick/thin sorting circuit 498 so as to be sorted into thick image density signals corresponding to high dye concentration, i.e., thick cyan, thick magenta, thick yellow and thick black and thin image density signals corresponding to low dye concentration, i.e., thin cyan, thin magenta, thin yellow and thin black.
    </p>
    <p num="172">FIG. 39 is a perspective view showing the critical portions of the color ink jet recording apparatus.</p>
    <p num="173">This recording apparatus is distinguished from that shown in FIG. 28 in that the pumps 520 and 521 which are disposed on both sides of the apparatus are movable by moving mechanisms which are not shown, so as to be connected to the sub-tanks 518Y, 518M, 518C and 518K which are carried by the carriage 511.</p>
    <p num="174">FIG. 40 illustrates a recording head unit as viewed in the direction opposing the surface having the arrays of ink discharge openings.</p>
    <p num="175">
      In this apparatus, each recording head corresponding to one of the four colors is provided with an array of discharge openings for thick ink and an array of discharge openings for thin ink, and four such recording head are assembled together to form an ink jet unit.
      <br/>
      The arrangement of the arrays of discharge openings of each head corresponding to one color is the same as that shown in FIG. 34.
    </p>
    <p num="176">A description will now be given of the image forming process performed by this color ink jet recording apparatus, with reference to FIG. 41, which schematically shows this process, based on the assumption that there is no gap between the array of thick ink discharge openings and the array of the thin ink discharge openings, as in the operation which was described before in connection with FIG. 35.</p>
    <p num="177">
      Regarding the recording of data of (N+1) th line, recording with thick inks of black, cyan, magenta and yellow inks is conducted in a first scanning cycle follows by a line feed LF.
      <br/>
      In a subsequent or second scanning cycle, recording is conducted with thin inks of black, cyan, magenta and yellow inks, followed by a line feed.
      <br/>
      The amount of line feed LF conducted after each scanning corresponds to 64 dots.
      <br/>
      Thus, an image is recorded over a width corresponding of 64 dots, through two successive scanning cycles.
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      As in the case of the preceding embodiments, the described color ink jet recording apparatus can produce an image of high quality without suffering from blur, because thick and thin inks are not simultaneously used in each scanning cycle.
      <br/>
      Actual ink jet unit operation involves blanks between successive colors, so that the juncture between successive scans of each color appear at different positions, thus suppressing generation of distinctive score lines at the boundary between successive scans.
    </p>
    <p num="179">
      The described arrangement also is effective in suppressing mixing of colors which tends to occur during discharge recovery operation.
      <br/>
      In particular, the recording head is preferably constructed such that the array of ink discharge openings for thin inks having lower level of thickness is disposed at the upper side of the array of discharge openings for thick ink.
      <br/>
      Such an arrangement is effective in preventing mixing of inks due to dragging after a sucking operation for recovering safe discharging condition.
    </p>
    <p num="180">FIG. 42 is a flow chart illustrative of the ink supplying process which is executed when the level of ink thickness is to be changed.</p>
    <p num="181">The process illustrated in FIG. 42 is discriminated from that process shown in FIG. 36 by Steps S238 to S240 in which inks are sucked from the respective recording heads after supply of inks to the respective sub-tanks.</p>
    <p num="182">(Another Modification of Third Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="183">Another modification of the third embodiment will be described.</p>
    <p num="184">FIG. 43 is a perspective view of a color ink jet recording apparatus as the above-described modification of the third embodiment, showing particularly critical portions of the modification.</p>
    <p num="185">
      In this color ink jet recording apparatus, pumps 651 for supplying thick and thin inks and pumps 655a, 655b for supplying clear ink are disposed on the left end portion of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      As will be seen from this Figure, the ink tanks of inks of the respective colors are supplied with the inks simultaneously as a result of movement of an integral supply block 650a.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the clear ink is supplied to the sub-tanks of the different colors one after another.
      <br/>
      It will be understood that this embodiment produces the same advantages as those offered by the third embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="186">(Fourth Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="187">A description will now be given of a fourth embodiment of the ink jet recording apparatus of the present invention which uses inks containing dyes and a clear ink which does not contain any dye, so as to enable blending of inks having different compositions within the apparatus.</p>

    <p num="193">A heat generating element (electro-thermal transducer), as means for generating thermal energy for discharging an ink, is disposed in each ink channel leading to corresponding ink discharge opening formed in the ink jet unit.</p>
    <p num="194">In operation, the electro-thermal transducers are activated based on recording signals in accordance with reading timing provided by the encoder (not shown), so that discrete ink droplets are made to fly towards and deposit on the recording member P, thereby forming an image.</p>
    <p num="195">
      A recovery unit having a cap device 7026 is disposed at a home position (HP) for the carriage which is set outside the recording region.
      <br/>
      The carriage 7023, when not operating, is stationed at the home position HP so that the surface of each ink jet unit having ink discharge openings is capped with the corresponding cap, thereby preventing clogging of ink discharge openings which otherwise may be caused by foreign matter such as dust or ink which has been solidified due to evaporation of the solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="196">
      The above-described capping function of the cap device 7026 also is used in other operations which are performed to avoid any discharge failure or clogging in discharge openings which are not used frequently.
      <br/>
      For instance, a purging operation is performed in which ink is jetted against the cap which is spaced from the discharge openings so as to purge any foreign matter or solidified ink in the discharge openings.
      <br/>
      A recovery sucking operation also can be conducted by applying, by means of a vacuum pump (not shown), vacuum to the space between the head surface having the discharge openings and the cap with which this surface is capped, thereby forcibly inducing and removing any matter clogging the discharge openings, thereby recovering safe discharging condition.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to arrange a blade or a wiping member in the vicinity of the cap device in such a manner as to rub the head surface where the discharge openings open in accordance with the movement of the carriage, thereby cleaning this surface of the recording head.

      The evacuation of the sub-tank is sensed by the remain amount detecting circuit and, thereafter, the operation described above is executed to blend a new ink by mixing the clear ink A and the dye-containing ink within the sub-tank, whereby the ink of the desired composition is newly prepared.

      In general, it has been recognized that the ink jetted from an ink jet recording apparatus can penetrate into recording paper more quickly when the value represented by  ETA /( GAMMA  cos  THETA ) is made smaller, where  ETA  indicates the viscosity of the ink,  GAMMA  indicates the surface tension of the ink and  THETA  indicates the attack angle at which the ink impinges upon the paper.
      <br/>
      In general, a smaller attack angle increases the degree of wetting of the paper with the ink so as to increase the penetration into the paper.
      <br/>
      However, the spreading tendency of the ink on the paper also is increased, so as to impair the sharpness of the dot and, hence, the clearness of the print.
      <br/>
      The printing clearness can be increased by lowering the degree of wetting of the paper with the ink.
      <br/>
      The lowered wetting degree, however, undesirably reduces the penetration.
      <br/>
      The inks having the compositions shown above generally exhibit high surface tension levels of 40 to 50 dyne/cm.
      <br/>
      This high level of surface tension, with good balance with fastness, reduces penetration into the paper so as to avoid feathering, i.e., undesirable spreading of the ink along random fibers of the paper, thus improving the quality of print of characters.
    </p>
    <p num="215">
      On the other hand, inks prepared by mixing the clear ink B exhibit very high fastness to ordinary papers such as copy paper or bond paper.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when color inks of this type are used, undesirable mixing of inks of different colors, i.e., bleeding. is avoided in the boundary between adjacent regions of different colors.
      <br/>
      At the same time, uniform coloring is obtained in the color region, without reduced unevenness of color.

      It is an effective measure to reduce the attack angle q so as to increase the degree of wetting of the paper with the ink, for the purpose of enhancing penetration.
      <br/>
      Surfactants are broadly used as means for enhancing the degree of wetting.
      <br/>
      The inks show above incorporate a nonionic surfactant so that the surface tension is generally as small as 30 dyne/cm.
      <br/>
      These inks, however, exhibit a greater degree of wetting of the paper and a greater tendency of spreading of ink on the paper, thus increasing the dot size, as well as very high penetration speed.
      <br/>
      However, the sharpness is impaired due to the increased dot size, as compared with the inks formed by mixing the clear ink A, and the color density of the dot itself is lowered for the same reason.
    </p>
    <p num="219">Examples of penetration agents suitably used in the clear ink B are: anion-type surfactants such as aerosol OT, dodecylbenzene sodium sulfonate, lauryl sulfate ester sodium and the like; and nonionic surfactants such as ethylene oxide adduct of higher alcohol expressed by the following formula (1), ethylene oxide adduct of alkylphenol expressed by the following formula (2), ethylene oxide-propylene oxide copolymer expressed by the following formula (3) and ethylene oxide adduct of acetylene glycol expressed by the following formula (4).</p>
    <p num="220">Preferably, however, the nonionic surfactants as expressed by the following formulae are used in the invention, partly because the anionic surfactants generally exhibit a high foaming tendency and are not easy to handle and partly because nonionic surfactants are generally superior to anionic surfactants in the imaging characteristics such as anti-bleeding characteristic and anti-feathering characteristic.</p>

      Among the ethylene-oxide-type nonionic surfactants mentioned above, ethylene oxide adduct of acetylene glycol is used most preferably because this surfactant exhibits a good balance of required properties or characteristics such as absorption in an ink absorber, imaging characteristics on recording medium, discharge characteristic during discharge from a recording head, and so forth.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, this type of surfactant enables control of hydrophilic nature and penetration by varying the number N of added ethylene oxide.
      <br/>
      When N is below 6, water solubility is impaired to reduce dissolution in the ink, although the penetration is improved.
      <br/>
      Conversely, a too large n causes the hydrophilic nature to be enhanced excessively to reduce the penetration.
      <br/>
      In particular, when N is increased beyond 14, the effect of addition of ethylene oxide is saturated, while the penetration is further reduced, having an undesirable effect on the discharge characteristic.
      <br/>
      Thus, the number N of added of ethylene oxide preferably ranges between 6 and 14.
    </p>
    <p num="228">Preferably, the amount of addition of nonionic surfactant ranges between 0.1 and 20 wt %. This surfactant does not have an appreciable effect in improving image characteristic and permeability when its content is below 0.1%, whereas addition of this surfactant in excess of 20% undesirably raises the cost of ink and impairs the reliability of the ink, while causing saturation in the effects produced by addition of this surfactant.</p>
    <p num="229">Each of the described nonionic surfactants may be used alone or two or more of them may be used in combination.</p>
    <p num="230">The inks also may contain dye as the coloring agent, low-volatile organic solvent such as polyhydric alcohol for preventing clogging, and organic solvent such as alcohol for attaining excellent bubbling stability and fastness on paper.</p>
    <p num="231">
      Examples of water-soluble organic solvents suitably contained in the ink used in the invention are: glycols such as polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol; alkylene glycols in which the alkylene group contains 2 to 6 carbon atoms, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,2,6-hexane triol, hexylene glycol and diethylene glycol; glycerol; low alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol methylether, diethylene glycol methyl (or ethyl) ether and triethylene glycol monomethyl (or ethyl) ether; alcohols such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, sec-butyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol and cyclohexanol; amides such as dimethyl formamide and dimethyl acetoamide; ketone or ketone alcohols such as acetone and diacetone alcohol; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; and nitrogen-containing cyclic compounds such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone.
      <br/>
      These water-soluble organic solvents are used in an amount that does not impair the image characteristics or discharge reliability.
      <br/>
      Among these water-soluble organic solvents, preferably used are polyhydric alcohols and alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols, and the content of such solvents preferably ranges between 1 and 30 wt %.

    <p num="232">The content of pure water in the ink used in the present invention preferably ranges between 50 and 90 wt %.</p>
    <p num="233">
      Various types of dye can be used as the dye component of the ink used in the present invention, such as direct dye, acidic dye, basic dye, reactive dye, disperse dye and a developer.
      <br/>
      The content of such dyes is determined in consideration of factors such as the type of liquid solvent, characteristics required for the ink, rate of discharge from the recording head and so forth.
      <br/>
      In general, however, the dye content ranges form 0.5 to 15 wt %, preferably from 1 to 7 wt %.

    <p num="234">
      It has proved that the effect of preventing clogging, as well as discharge characteristics, is remarkably improved when thioglycol or urea (or its derivative) is contained in the ink.
      <br/>
      This effect is attributable to the fact that the dissolution of the dye in the ink is improved by the addition of such a component.
      <br/>
      The content of thioglycol or urea (or derivative) preferably ranges from 1 to 30 wt %, although the addition of thioglycol or urea (or derivative) is not essential.
    </p>
    <p num="235">The ink used in the present invention can contain, in addition to the main components described above, a viscosity adjusting agent such as polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose and water-soluble resin; a pH adjuster such as diethanol amine, triethanol amine or a buffer; and/or antimold agent, in an amount which does not hamper the advantages of the invention.</p>

      The invention can be embodied in the form of an ink jet recording apparatus of the type which electrostatically charges the ink.

      Although a multi-color ink jet recording apparatus has been specifically described, it will be clear that the described fourth embodiment can equally be applied to a monochromatic recording apparatus or color recording apparatus which performs recording of a specific color other than black and white.

      The ink compositions described hereinbefore are also only illustrative.

      Although in the described embodiments the quality or nature of the recorded image is variable on ordinary recording paper sheets such as bond paper, copy paper or the like, the described ink jet recording apparatus may b modified to use also a clear ink which is used in preparing an ink suitable for recording on other type of recording medium such as transparency sheet of an overhead projector (OHP).

      A recording method adaptable to the ink jet recording apparatus and using a plurality of inks having different concentrations has been suggested in order to improve the gradation characteristics, in particular the characteristics of highlight portions.
      <br/>
      A dark and light multi-valued recording method using dark and light inks having a plurality of concentrations of the same color is able to improve the gradation characteristics in the highlight portions, reduce the granular apperance of the dots and improve the image quality.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      The organic solvent, such as the diethylene glycol is added mainly for the purpose of preventing clogging.
      <br/>
      Since the dark ink containing the dye at a high concentration easily clogs as compared with the light ink, it is preferable that the concentration of the organic solvent be determined to be adaptable to the composition of the dark ink.

      A surface active agent has characteristics that the quality of the formed image is not substantially changed if the concentration of the same is larger than a predetermined quantity.
      <br/>
      Although the surface active agent decreases the surface tension of the ink in inverse proportion to the quantity thereof, the surface tension cannot be changed further if its concentration is higher than the micellar limit concentration level.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the concentration of the surface active agent has been raised to a level higher than a certain level, the surface tension between the material, on which an image is recorded, and the ink is not changed, that is the wettability is not changed furthermore.
      <br/>
      The ethylene oxide additive of the acetylene glycol does not vary the quality of the image if its quantity is larger than 2 to 3 wt %. Therefore, it is also preferable that the composition of a penetrating agent be determined to be a value sufficient to prepare the dark ink.

      The aforesaid method can be adapted to both a so-called on-demand type apparatus and a continuous type apparatus.
      <br/>
      In particular, a satisfactory effect can be obtained when the on-demand type apparatus is employed because of the structure arranged in such a manner that one or more drive signals, which rapidly raise the temperature of an electricity-to-heat converter disposed to face a sheet or a fluid passage which holds the fluid (ink) to a level higher than levels at which nucleate boiling takes place are applied to the electricity-to-heat converter so as to generate heat energy in the electricity-to-heat converter and to cause at the heat effecting surface of the recording head film boiling to take place so that bubbles can be formed in the fluid (ink) to correspond to the one or more drive signals.
      <br/>
      The enlargement/contraction of the bubble will cause the fluid (ink) to be discharged through a discharging opening so that one or more droplets are formed.
      <br/>
      If a pulse shaped drive signal is employed, the bubble can be enlarged/contracted immediately and properly, causing a further preferred effect to be obtained because the fluid (ink) can be discharged with excellent responsiveness.
