    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="4">The present invention relates to control systems and, more particularly, to low DC voltage detection systems responsive to radiated body heat for operating various apparatus.</p>
    <p num="5">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="6">
      Single or multi user wash basins used in industrial, commercial or public environments provide a source of water on demand for cleansing a user's hands, face and other body parts.
      <br/>
      Water flow valve actuating mechanisms are often manually or foot operated lever type devices to permit relative ease of use.
      <br/>
      The manually operated lever type devices may become soiled or otherwise damaged due to dirt and other contamination present on a user's hands prior to washing.
      <br/>
      The foot operated lever type devices are often subjected to abuse.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Dispensation of soap, whether liquid or powder, is usually achieved by manually operating a lever, a push button or a squeeze bottle; adaptations for operating such devices by foot are also known.
      <br/>
      To dry oneself, a user must manually grasp and pull individual folded paper towels from a dispenser, pull and tear off paper towels from a roll, pull down an endless cloth towel from an enclosed feed roller or push a button to actuate a hot air blower.
      <br/>
      All of these manually (and foot) operated devices accumulate a residue of dirt, bacteria and viruses at the locations of contact by the users.
      <br/>
      The constituents of this residue may contribute to the spread of disease and otherwise present a public health hazard.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      To avoid the requirements for having a user physically actuate a valve in order to cause water flow at a wash basin, various sensors have been developed and incorporated with valve actuating mechanisms to sense the presence of a user at a wash basin.
      <br/>
      Actuating apparatus of this type have included devices for generating ultrasonic energy focused upon a detector; or, upon a change in the energy detected due to the presence of a user, a signal may be generated for actuating a water flow valve.
      <br/>
      In one water faucet device, the faucet is rotatable to permit automatic water flow actuation or require manual valve control as a function of the rotational position of the faucet.
      <br/>
      Various devices have been developed which include a light emitter with a corresponding detector.
      <br/>
      Upon interruption of the light path by a wash basin user, actuation of a water flow valve will occur.
      <br/>
      Audio responsive detectors for actuating water flow valves associated with water basins and the like are known.
      <br/>
      Infrared detector systems include a generator for generating a source of infrared energy and a detector responsive thereto.
      <br/>
      Upon interruption of the infrared energy by a user, circuitry is energized for actuating a water flow valve.
      <br/>
      Several devices have also been developed for sensing the radiant energy of a human body part and actuating a water flow valve upon such sensing.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A common characteristic of prior art related devices for sensing the presence of a user and actuating a water flow valve and other devices is that such systems are active systems.
      <br/>
      That is, a signal generator is provided with a corresponding receiver.
      <br/>
      A change in signal intensity sensed by the receiver related circuitry and in response to the presence of a user, is detected and serves as a triggering signal for actuating a valve.
      <br/>
      The requirement for transmission of a signal, in combination with signal detection circuitry, imposes a requirement for a relatively substantial power supply.
      <br/>
      Such power supply requirements in essence negate the use of low voltage small capacity batteries as the power supply.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      A low voltage battery energized passive detection system generates a control signal in response to radiated heat from a human body to actuate a solenoid operated fluid flow valve for a predetermined limited time period unless an earlier cessation of body radiated heat triggers shut off of the valve.
      <br/>
      The configuration of the sensor in combination with its placement within a wash basin or upon a water spout establishes the configuration of the effective detection field to eliminate false signals.
      <br/>
      Additional timed and time dependent functions ancillary to washing, such as soap dispensation, air dryer operation and towel availability, can be energized.
      <br/>
      To avoid the possibility of the valve remaining open due to insufficient electrical power to effect closure of the valve, a fail safe circuit can be used to close and disable the valve in the closed position when the voltage of the power supply drops below a predetermined value.
    </p>
    <p num="11">It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide a passive detection system for detecting the presence of body heat within a defined detection field.</p>
    <p num="12">Another object of the present invention is to provide an automatically operated water basin for sensing the presence of body heat within a detection field.</p>
    <p num="13">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a low DC power detection system responsive to the presence of a human body part for controlling actuation of water flow in a wash basin along with related and ancillary functions.</p>
    <p num="14">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a flow control system for a wash basin which automatically terminates further flow upon sensing a reduced voltage power supply.</p>
    <p num="15">A further object of the present invention is to provide a water flow control system for wash basins having very low electrical power drain and operable in excess of a year or more by a low voltage low power battery source.</p>
    <p num="16">A still further object of the present invention is to provide the capability of operating a selected number of functions ancillary to water dispensation for washing purposes on a timed sequence and for a present duration.</p>
    <p num="17">A still further object of the present invention is to provide a miniaturized sensor and control circuit mountable within a water spout for sensing the presence of a human body part within a predetermined limited space.</p>
    <p num="18">A still further object of the present invention is to provide a water spout mounted sensor for sensing the presence of a human body part to operate a selected one of a plurality of functions.</p>
    <p num="19">A still further object of the present invention is to provide a method for operating a passive detection system responsive to the presence of a human body part within a detection field.</p>
    <p num="20">A yet further object of the present invention is to provide a method responsive to the presence of body heat for controlling the flow of water in a wash basin and for controlling selected ones of a plurality of functions ancillary to the act of washing.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="23">
      Public wash basins of the type used predominantly in various industrial, commercial and public establishments require manipulation of levers, knobs, handles or push buttons to bring about water flow.
      <br/>
      Often, each of a hot and cold water tap must be adjusted to obtain a satisfactory temperature of the outflowing water.
      <br/>
      Such ongoing contact by dirty and/or contaminated hands promotes spread of bacteria and viruses due to the final manual contact to turn off the water flow after one's hands have been washed.
      <br/>
      The transfer of bacteria and viruses will contribute to the spread of disease.
      <br/>
      Where such diseases are life threatening or permanently disabling, the risks of using public wash basins become intolerable.
      <br/>
      Similar risks exist in actuating soap dispensers, supplies of towels, air driers and other ancillary apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Preferably, the act of washing one's hands or face in a wash basin available to the public should not require physical contact with any part of the wash basin, associated implements or ancillary equipment.
      <br/>
      Apparatus for automatically discharging water should discharge such water at a preset temperature and for a period of time sufficient only to complete a washing function in order to conserve water.
      <br/>
      The operative elements should be actuated as a function of the proximity of the user's hands or body.
      <br/>
      Means should be employed to eliminate or prevent false actuation and means should be employed to terminate water flow prior to a preset time if use of the water ceases.
      <br/>
      Moreover, ancillary equipment should be operated commensurate with the timing of the washing operation.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Any electrical power source and any electrically energized components must be of sufficiently low voltage and power level to eliminate any electrical hazard.
      <br/>
      As many washing facilities are remote from a ready source of electrical power, the electrical power source for the actuating unit should be a low voltage battery.
      <br/>
      To permit extended uninterrupted operation, the power requirements of the operating system should have very low current consumption to permit use well in excess of a year and, preferably, for several years.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring to FIG. 1a, there is illustrated a top view of a representative wash basin 10.
      <br/>
      The wash basin includes a bowl 12, a drain 14 and a spout 16 for discharging water.
      <br/>
      To sense or detect the presence of the hands of a user, a detection field 20 is established primarily only within bowl 12.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 1b, the horizontal configuration of detection field 20 is generally round or ellipsoidal in cross section and conforming to a horizontal plane through bowl 12.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The vertical configuration of detection field 20 is best illustrated in FIGS. 2a and 2b. A sensor 22, responsive to a heat source such as a human body part within detection field 20, is usually located, for example, in rear wall 18 of bowl 12.
      <br/>
      The vertical parameter of detection field 20 is limited at the lower half by bowl 12.
      <br/>
      The upper limit of the detection field may be mechanically limited by a restrictor 24 used in conjunction with sensor 22.
      <br/>
      As particularly illustrated in FIG. 2b, the original detection field for sensor 22 would include the volumes represented by areas 1, 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      Area 3 is eliminated by bowl 12, which bowl defines the lower perimeter of area 2.
      <br/>
      Upper area 1 may be eliminated by restrictor 24 operating in conjunction with the sensor.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the detection field to which sensor 22 is responsive is essentially limited by the space within bowl 12 and extending in rounded manner slightly upwardly therefrom.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In certain applications it may be preferable to have the sensor, such as sensor 26, mounted upon water spout 16.
      <br/>
      Generally, detection field 20 will extend downwardly from sensor 26 into bowl 12 of wash basin 10.
      <br/>
      A restrictor 28 may be employed in conjunction with sensor 26 to define the downwardly extending cone angle or horizontal configuration and downward expansion rate of detection field 20.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Such limited detection field will prevent water flow during normal movement past wash basin 10 and essentially requires a user to place his hands or other body part essentially within the bowl of the water basin.</p>
    <p num="30">
      Referring to FIG. 3, there is illustrated a representation of the major components of the present invention which may be installed as original equipment or as retrofit equipment in a wash basin.
      <br/>
      Module 30 includes a heat sensor or infrared sensor 22/26 (see FIGS. 2a and 2c) that may be penetrably mounted in rear wall 18 of a wash basin 20 (see FIG. 2a) or in spout 16 (see FIG. 2c).
      <br/>
      For reasons discussed above, the parameters of the field, within which sensor 22/26 will detect a heat source represented by a body part is limited to the volume essentially within the wash basin.
      <br/>
      The sensor produces an output signal and a module 30 may include an amplifier for amplifying the output signal.
      <br/>
      To establish a threshold of operation for sensor 22/26, a regulating device 32 may be incorporated.
      <br/>
      The circuit attendant the regulating device may be contained within module 30 and be connected to the regulating device via conductor 34.
      <br/>
      The regulating device permits establishment of a threshold temperature for the sensor to accommodate variations in ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      A module 36, interconnected with module 30 through an electrical conductor or cable 38, includes timing circuitry for generating a control signal to provide power to actuate a water valve controlling the water flow through spout 16.
      <br/>
      Circuitry for deactuating the water valve, along with a time delay to minimize false actuations, are also contained within module 36.
      <br/>
      Because a certain amount of power is required to deactuate or close the water valve, it is mandatory that sufficient power be available to perform this function.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a fail safe circuit may be contained within module 36 to lock the water valve in the off or closed position when the source of power drops below a predetermined voltage (for example, 7.5 volts if a standard 9 volt battery is used).
      <br/>
      A conductor 40 conveys electrical power to the water valve (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      A characteristic of active detection systems is the transmission of a signal which is reflected from a triggering object to a receiver.
      <br/>
      Such transmission requires a substantial amount of power.
      <br/>
      A passive system is one in which a signal is received from the triggering element.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the power demand of a passive system is substantially less than that of an active system.
      <br/>
      Since the present invention is a passive system, and by careful circuit design, very little power is required for operation.
      <br/>
      To further reduce the power demand, low power consumption programmable microchip technology may be employed, as discussed in further detail below.
      <br/>
      Power consumption can be further reduced by having the system operate in a standby state until the presence of a human body part within the detector field triggers operation of the various control and timing functions.
      <br/>
      For this reason, a conventional nine (9) volt battery 42 may be used as a power supply.
      <br/>
      The battery is electrically connected to module 36 via a conventional clip 44 and electrical conductors 46.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Referring to FIG. 4a, there is illustrated a block diagram of a discrete component circuit and operation of detection system 50.
      <br/>
      Heat detector or sensor 22/26 is a dual element pyro electric heat detector specifically intended for battery operated passive detection systems.
      <br/>
      It has differentially connected dual elements which provide immunity from background radiation and noise.
      <br/>
      The spectral response of the sensor is in the range or five to fifteen  MU m; this is the range of the wave length of the infrared rays emitted by heat radiation from a human body part.
      <br/>
      The frequency range is 0.1 to 20 Hz; such low frequency range essentially eliminates any influence from ambient or expected acoustic noise sources.
      <br/>
      The quiescent power drain of the sensor is approximately 10  MU A and represents a very low current drain.
      <br/>
      The dual elements are combined with a single impedance converting amplifier specially designed to require a low voltage power supply and the amplifier has a low current consumption.
      <br/>
      An output signal is provided by the sensor only upon occurrence of an imbalance of radiation impinging upon the dual elements.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the sensor contains ceramic plates sensitive to radiant heat and serving as electric dipoles permanently polarized which change polarity only upon a sudden change in voltage potential across the electrodes resulting from a sudden change of temperature.
      <br/>
      Since the sensor is not sensitive to ambient temperature, but only to a sudden change of temperature, the sensor is self adjusting and accommodates slow changes in ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      More specifically, one of the ceramic plates reacts to the ambient temperature while the other plate is subjected to heat irradiating from the human body.
      <br/>
      This change in temperature registered by the plates generates an output signal.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The output signal generated by sensor 22/26 is transmitted to a multistage circuit 52 including an amplifier to amplify the low level output signal generated by the sensor and a band pass filter.
      <br/>
      Means may be incorporated to permit adjustment of the threshold of the output signal received from sensor 22/26 and amplified by use of regulating device 32 (see FIG. 3) or the like.

      A signal edge detector 56 detects positive and negative variations of a magnitude greater than a predetermined threshold of the signal received from multistage circuit 52 via conductor 58.

      The output of the valve open timer is transmitted via conductor 68 to pulse generator 70.

      On receipt of the output signal, the pulse generator will activate power driver 72 via conductor 74.
      <br/>
      The power driver will provide power to an electromagnetic valve, represented by numeral 76, to open the valve and permit water flow through spout 16.
      <br/>
      The output from valve open timer 66 is also transmitted via conductor 80 to a four (4) second timer 82.

      After valve 76 has been open for approximately four (4) seconds, timer 82 will transmit a signal via conductor 84 to a battery checker 86.
      <br/>
      The function of the battery checker is to determine whether the power supply (battery) is maintaining a voltage above a predetermined level during energization of valve 76.
      <br/>
      Power driver 94 and closure of the valve require a predetermined amount of electrical power.
      <br/>
      Such power level can be translated to a minimum acceptable voltage at the power supply or battery if the characteristics of the power supply or battery are known.
      <br/>
      In the event the voltage sensed is below the predetermined value, an output is provided via conductor 88 to a battery killer circuit 90.
      <br/>
      The function of the battery killer circuit is to generate a control signal for transmission via conductor 92 to power driver 94.
      <br/>
      On energization of power driver 94, an output signal is generated and transmitted via conductor 96 to close the water valve.
      <br/>
      This procedure will ensure that the water valve will not remain open due to a power drain or low voltage at the power supply.
    </p>

      Valve open timer 66 also determines the time during which the valve will remain open.

      On completion of this time period (nominally 20 seconds), a further output signal is generated and transmitted to pulse generator 100 via conductor 102.
      <br/>
      The pulse generator will provide a signal via conductor 104 to power driver 94 to close the valve.
      <br/>
      The second output signal is also transmitted to hold off timer 106 via conductor 108.
      <br/>
      The purpose of the hold off timer is to provide a delay of approximately six (6) seconds before the valve can be opened again.
      <br/>
      Hold off timer 106 transmits a signal to hold off circuit 62 via conductor 110 to preempt or inhibit transmission of a signal via conductor 64 to valve open timer 66 prior to expiration of the delay period.

      There is a growing demand by industry, governments and various commercial interests to install individual automatically operating faucets.
      <br/>
      At such locations, the space available for sensors, electronic circuitry and power supplies is at a premium.
      <br/>
      To meet this need, apparatus has been developed for mounting the control circuitry within the faucet spout itself.
      <br/>
      Such mounting eliminates constraints placed upon the wash basin and upon supporting and ancillary equipment attendant the wash basin and its mounting.
      <br/>
      Miniaturization can be achieved, as described hereinafter, with a programmed (programmable) microchip and a printed integrated circuit having surface mounted components.
      <br/>
      Within this technology, the fixed value components are generally surface mounted while the variable components or parameters are programmed in a microchip.
      <br/>
      Such miniaturization permits combining the elements or their equivalents and the functions performed by modules 30 and 36 (see FIG. 3) on a microchip in combination with sensor 22/26.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the mounting space is reduced and it becomes feasible to mount the sensor and its control circuitry within the spout of a water basin or the like.

    <p num="44">
      As described above, a water flow cycle of twenty (20) seconds with a six (6) second delay between cycles provides adeauate and satisfactory results.
      <br/>
      However, such predetermined time periods do not optimize water conservation.
      <br/>
      By turning the water flow on and off automatically as a function of actual use, further water conservation can be effected.
      <br/>
      To eliminate continuing water flow due to a foreign object within the detection field or to prevent cessation of water flow when a user is momentarily out of the detection field, special parameters must be accommodated.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The water flow is initiated upon sensing of a human body part within the detection field and the water flow will continue for a preset time period unless otherwise modified.
      <br/>
      Interruption of the water flow will occur if a human body part is not sensed within the detection field for a discrete period of time, such as approximately 2.5 seconds.
      <br/>
      This time period will preclude cessation of water flow during a momentary removal of the human body part from within the detection field and yet bring about a cessation of water flow when a user would normally be performing another function on completion of washing the body part.
      <br/>
      A time delay between water flow initiation periods can be preserved to reduce the likelihood of rapid on/off cycling due to abuse.
      <br/>
      Because of the programmability of the microchip, numerous other functions can be initiated and controlled as a function of the sensing of a human body part within the detection field.
      <br/>
      These functions include automatic soap dispensing, automatic actuation of air dryers, automatic dispensation of hand towels, water temperature control, light actuation, air exhaust, and various building facility control functions.
      <br/>
      As described above, the microchip can be mounted almost anywhere when space is at a premium.

      Referring to FIG. 9, there is shown various components and a flow diagram of the functions performable by a miniaturized and programmable version of the previously described apparatus.

      In variant 128 shown in FIG. 9, a human body part, represented by block 130, emits radiation, represented by arrows 132.
      <br/>
      The transmitted radiation is sensed by sensor 22/26 provided that the human body part is within detection field 20 (see FIGS. 2a to 2c) of the sensor.
      <br/>
      The output signal from sensor 22/26 is transmitted through conductor 134 to an amplifier and band pass filter 136.

    <p num="47">
      The variant of the passive system illustrated in FIG. 9 is normally in its standby state, which requires a very, very low power demand.
      <br/>
      Hence, until sensor 22/26 detects the presence of a human body part, minimal demands are made upon the power supply.
      <br/>
      As described previously, the variant is passive, which means that it does not generate a signal for transmission to determine the presence of an object of interest.
      <br/>
      Instead, the variant simply receives and detects receipt of radiation in a limited frequency range.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the detection field can be limited or expanded as a function of sensor 22/26 and any restrictor used in conjunction therewith to limit or modify the horizontal and vertical parameters of the detection field.
      <br/>
      Such limited detection field will prevent spurious actuation which unnecessarily draws power.
      <br/>
      Moreover, with the limited detection field, the sensitivity of sensor 22/26 can be optimized for the environment and for utilitarian purposes.

      Referring to FIG. 10, there is illustrated a three user position wash basin 270 which may incorporate the present invention to control and regulate operation of each of three water spouts 272,274 and 276 as a function of the presence of a user (body heat) in proximity to the respective user position about the wash basin.
      <br/>
      The wash basin includes a generally semicircular bowl 278 having a splash panel 280 to accommodate locating the wash basin against a wall.
      <br/>
      In a wash basin of this configuration, the three. user positions are the front center, and the right and left sections rearwardly of center.
      <br/>
      Spouts 272,274 and 276 are located within an overhanging cabinet 282, including a cover 282a, in general correspondence with the user positions.
      <br/>
      A source of hot and cold water may be provided through hoses 284,286 from respective sources to a mixing valve 288.
      <br/>
      The output of the mixing valve may be conveyed through a pipe 290 to a manifold or the like (not shown).
      <br/>
      Three conduits, 292,294 and 296 extend from pipe 290, or an attached manifold, to interconnect spouts 272,274,276, respectively, with pipe 290.
      <br/>
      In conjunction with each spout, a sensor 302,304 and 306 may be mounted in the respective one of modules 308,310 and 312.
      <br/>
      These sensors may be of the type discussed above and identified by numerals 22 or 26.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, restrictors may be incorporated with the sensors to focus the detection field at and about each respective user position.
      <br/>
      The control and regulatory circuitry attendant each sensor may be mounted upon a microchip, as discussed above,.to provide programmed and programmable functions.
      <br/>
      Each of these microchips may be mounted upon or as part of the respective one of modules 308,310 and 312.
      <br/>
      Thus, the control and regulatory circuitry in conjunction with the respective one of the sensors may be located adjacent the respective.one of spouts 272,274 and 276.
