    <p num="4">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Many metallocene compounds are known to be active as catalyst components in the olefin polymerization reactions.
      <br/>
      A particular class of these metallocenes is that of stereorigid metallocene compounds having two cyclopentadienyl ligands joined by means of a bridging group which gives stereo-rigidity to the molecule.
      <br/>
      These compounds, which are generally referred to as bridged metallocenes, can be prepared from the corresponding bridged ligands.
    </p>
    <p num="6">While compounds having two bridged ligands of the indenyl type are widely known, there are only a few disclosures of compounds having two bridged fluorenyl groups.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 1 249 782, it is described the preparation of the potassium salt of the bis(fluorenyl)dimethylsilane to be used for preparing organo-lantanide hydrides.
      <br/>
      These compounds are useable as catalysts for the hydrogenation of olefins of every type and for the polymerization of ethylene.

      A process for the preparation of bridged fluorenyl-containing compounds is disclosed in EP-A-512,554.

      The metallocene compounds of formula (I) can be prepared from the corresponding fluorenyl ligands with a process which comprises the following steps:

      (a) the reaction of a compound of formula (II):  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
      <br/>
      wherein substituents R1, the same or different from each other, are defined as above, with a compound able to form the anion of formula (III):  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
      <br/>
      and thereafter with a compound of formula EX2, wherein R2 is defined as above, and the substituents X, same or different from each other, are halogen atoms, thus obtaining a compound of formula (IV):  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)
      <br/>
      (b) the subsequent reaction of the compound of formula (IV) obtained at point (a) with a compound able to form the dianion of formula (V):  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)
      <br/>
      and thereafter with a compound of formula MX'4, wherein M is defined as above and the substituents X' are halogen atoms, thus obtaining the compound of formula (VI):  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)
      <br/>
      and finally,
      <br/>
      (c) in the case at least one X in the metallocene of formula (I) to be prepared is different from halogen, the substitution of at least one substituent X' in the compound of formula (VI) with at least one X different from halogen.

      The substitution reaction of substituents X' in the compound of formula (VI) with substituents X different from halogen is carried out by generally used methods.

      According to an embodiment of the process according to the invention, the synthesis of the ligand of formula (IV) is suitably performed by adding a solution of an organic lithium compound in an aprotic solvent to a solution of the compound (II) in an aprotic solvent.

    <p num="58">
      A particularly interesting use of the catalysts of the invention is the polymerization of propylene.
      <br/>
      The propylene polymers obtainable with the present catalysts are endowed with an atactic structure and, therefore, they are substantially amorphous.
      <br/>
      Their melting enthalpy ( DELTA Hf) is generally not measurable.

      The structure of the aforementioned propylene polymers is substantially atactic.

      Polymerization yields depend on the purity of the metallocene component of the catalyst.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in order to increase the yields of polymerization, metallocenes are generally used after a purification treatment.
      <br/>
      A major advantage of the metallocenes of the invention over those of the prior art is represented by their higher solubilities, allowing to obtain them in highly purified form and, consequently, to increase the polymerization yields to a significative extent.
