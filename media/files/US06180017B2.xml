    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/353,577 filed on Jul. 15, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,403. This invention relates to a pool skimmer basket assembly including a buoyant handle.
      <br/>
      The handle allows ready and convenient access to the basket for removal and cleaning.
      <br/>
      The invention is applicable to both in-ground and above-ground pools.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      In the pool industry, much attention has been given to the problem of capturing and removing bugs, leaves, and other debris floating on the surface of the water.
      <br/>
      One common and generally effective means for combating this problem involves the use of a filter passage, or skimmer passage, formed in a side wall of the pool and having an inlet adjacent the water level.
      <br/>
      The skimmer passage communicates with a water pump which draws water from the surface of the pool through the passage inlet and through a skimmer basket where the waste debris is separated from the pool water.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The skimmer basket has a handle, an open top, a cylindrical body, and a bottom formed with the body.
      <br/>
      The body and bottom define a rigid grid-like structure with openings that allow free passage of water through the basket, while capturing debris inside the basket.
      <br/>
      A pivoted skimmer weir located at the passage inlet operates to prevent any back flow of debris into the pool.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In order to maintain its effectiveness, the skimmer basket must be periodically removed and emptied.
      <br/>
      To facilitate this, convenient access to the basket is provided through an opening formed in the surface of the pool deck.
      <br/>
      According to one prior art skimmer basket, the handle is attached at the top perimeter of the basket and extends laterally over the basket opening.
      <br/>
      Thus, in order to remove the basket, the pool cleaner must insert his hand downwardly into the debris-filled water and feel around for the handle.
      <br/>
      This can be an especially unappealing task given the variety of bugs, snakes, frogs, and other creatures that are commonly trapped in the skimmer passage.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a pool skimmer basket assembly which includes a buoyant handle that floats to the top of the water level in the filter passage for convenient access to the pool cleaner.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT AND BEST MODE</heading>
    <p num="24">
      Referring now specifically to the drawings, a pool skimmer basket assembly according to the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 and shown generally at reference numeral 10.
      <br/>
      The assembly 10 includes a skimmer basket 11 with an extendable handle 12, an open top 14, and attached side and bottom walls 15 and 16.
      <br/>
      The walls 15 and 16 form a rigid, grid-like structure defining a multiplicity of small openings.
      <br/>
      The basket 11 sits in a cylindrical cavity "C" in a filter passage "F" formed in a side wall of the pool "P".
      <br/>
      The filter passage "F" communicates with a water pump (not shown) which operates to draw pool water and debris inwardly through the filter passage "F" and into the skimmer basket 11.
      <br/>
      The grid-like structure of the basket walls 15 and 16 allows pool water to pass through the basket 11, while capturing and separating waste debris entrained in the pool water.
      <br/>
      A skimmer weir "W" located at the passage inlet "I" operates to prevent any back flow of debris into the pool "P".
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      As best shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the extendable handle 12 of the basket 11 includes a pair of spaced vertical members 21 and 22 integrally formed with top and bottom horizontal members 23 and 24.
      <br/>
      The vertical members 21 and 22 slidably extend through diametrically opposed, rigid sleeves 25 and 26 formed adjacent the open top 14 of the basket 11 and through respective openings 27 and 28 formed in the bottom wall 16.
      <br/>
      The bottom horizontal member 24 of the handle 12 carries a float 30, and serves to help support the weight of the basket 11 when lifted from the basket cavity "C" for emptying and cleaning.
      <br/>
      The top horizontal member 23 of the handle 12 defines a grip portion for being grasped by the pool cleaner.
      <br/>
      As water fills the filter passage "F" and enters the basket 11, the float 30 causes the top member 23 of the handle 12 to move upwardly from the lowered position, shown in FIGS. 1 and 4, to the raised position, shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      The float 30 is made of any suitable buoyant material, such as polystyrene or cork.
      <br/>
      The basket 11 and sleeves 25 and 26 are preferably integrally molded of a hard durable plastic, such as PVC.
      <br/>
      The handle 12 is preferably formed of stainless steel, ABS, PVC, or any suitably buoyant material.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring to FIGS. 1-4, to empty the basket 11, the pool cleaner removes the lid "L" from a user access opening "O" formed in the pool deck "D" and grasps the top horizontal member 23 of the handle 12 located at or above the surface of the water in the filter passage "F".
      <br/>
      The basket 11 is then removed from the basket cavity "C", emptied, cleaned, and replaced, and the lid "L" repositioned over the access opening "O".
