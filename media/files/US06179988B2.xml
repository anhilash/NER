      More particularly, this invention relates to a process for making copper wire that includes the steps of forming a circular disk of electrodeposited copper, peeling a thin strip of copper from the peripheral edge of the disk, and slitting the strip of copper to form strands of copper wire.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Conventional methods for making copper wire involve the following steps.
      <br/>
      Electrolytic copper (electrorefined, electrowon, or both) is melted, cast into bar shape, and hot rolled into a rod shape.
      <br/>
      The rod is then cold-worked as it is passed through drawing dies that systematically reduce the diameter while elongating the wire.
      <br/>
      In a typical operation, a rod manufacturer casts the molten electrolytic copper into a bar having a cross section that is substantially trapazoidal in shape with rounded edges and a cross sectional area of about 7 square inches.
      <br/>
      This bar is passed through a preparation stage to trim the corners, and then through 12 rolling stands from which it exits in the form of a 0.3125" diameter copper rod.
      <br/>
      The copper rod is then reduced to a desired wire size through standard drawing dies.
      <br/>
      Typically, these reductions occur in a series of dies with a final annealing step and in some instances intermediate annealing steps to soften the worked wire.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The conventional method of copper wire production consumes significant amounts of energy and requires extensive labor and capital costs.
      <br/>
      The melting, casting and hot rolling operations subject the product to oxidation and potential contamination from foreign materials, such as refractory and roll materials, which can subsequently cause problems to wire drawers which include wire breaks during drawing.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      By virtue of the inventive process, copper wire is produced in a simplified and less costly manner when compared to the prior art.
      <br/>
      The inventive process utilizes electrodeposited cathodic copper as the copper source, and thus does not require use of the prior art steps of melting, casting and hot rolling to provide a copper rod feedstock.
    </p>
    <p num="5">U.S. Pat. No. 440,548 discloses a method for making wire which comprises electrodepositing a shell or cylinder of copper on a core, mold or mandrel; removing the deposited copper from the core, mold or mandrel using thermal expansion/contraction, or the rotary motion of a lathe coupled with the pressing movement of a roller; mounting the removed shell or cylinder of deposited copper in a machine for the purpose of cutting the shell or cylinder circumferentially into a continuous strip or rod; and drawing the strip or rod to form wire.</p>

      U.S. Pat. No. 5,516,408 discloses a process for making copper wire directly from a copper-bearing material, comprising: (A) contacting said copper-bearing material with an effective amount of at least one aqueous leaching solution to dissolve copper ions into said leaching solution and form a copper-rich aqueous leaching solution; (B) contacting said copper-rich aqueous leaching solution with an effective amount of at least one water-insoluble extractant to transfer copper ions from said copper-rich aqueous leaching solution to said extractant to form a copper-rich extractant and a copper-depleted aqueous leaching solution; (C) separating said copper-rich extractant from said copper-depleted aqueous leaching solution; (D) contacting said copper-rich extractant with an effective amount of at least one aqueous stripping solution to transfer copper ions from said extractant to said stripping solution to form a copper-rich stripping solution and a copper-depleted extractant; (E) separating said copper-rich stripping solution from said copper-depleted extractant; (F) flowing said copper-rich stripping solution between an anode and a cathode, and applying an effective amount of voltage across said anode and said cathode to deposit copper on said cathode; (G) removing said copper from said cathode; and (H) converting said removed copper from (G) to copper wire at a temperature below the melting point of said copper.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment the copper that is deposited on the cathode during (F) is in the form of copper foil, and the process includes (H-1) slitting the copper foil into a plurality of strands of copper wire and (H-2) shaping the strands of copper wire to provide said strands of copper wire with desired cross-sections.

    <p num="10">
      The circular disk of copper, which is formed during step (A) of the inventive process, is made using electrodeposition.
      <br/>
      The circular disk typically has a thickness of about 0.1 to about 1 inch, and in one embodiment about 0.1 to about 0.5 inch, and in one embodiment about 0.2 to about 0.3 inch; and a diameter of up to about 60 inches, and in one embodiment about 4 to about 60 inches, and in one embodiment about 10 to about 40 inches, and in one embodiment about 24 to about 40 inches.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the circular disk is electrodeposited directly in the form of a circular disk.

Since the circular disk, or the copper plate used to make the circular disk, is formed using electrodeposition, it is sometimes referred to as a copper cathode or cathodic copper.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Electrodeposition Process</p>
    <p num="14">
      In one embodiment, the circular disk of copper, or the copper plate used to make the circular disk, is formed using an electrodeposition process which employs as the copper feedstock any conventional copper feedstock used for electrodepositing copper, including copper shot, scrap copper metal, scrap copper wire, recycled copper, cupric oxide, cuprous oxide, and the like.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the circular disk, or the copper plate used to make the circular disk, is electrodeposited in an electroforming cell equipped with a series of cathodes and anodes.
      <br/>
      Typically the cathodes are vertically mounted and have flat surfaces.
      <br/>
      The cathodes can be circular in the form, or they can have square or rectangular shapes.
      <br/>
      The anodes are adjacent to the cathodes and are typically in the form of flat plates having the same shape as the cathodes.
      <br/>
      The gap between the cathodes and the anodes is typically from about 1 to about 10 centimeters, and in one embodiment about 2.5 to about 5 centimeters.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the anode is insoluble and made of lead, lead alloy, or titanium coated with a platinum family metal (i.e., Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru) or oxide thereof.
      <br/>
      The cathode has smooth surfaces on each side for receiving the electrodeposited copper and, in one embodiment, the surface is made of stainless steel, chrome plated stainless steel or titanium.
      <br/>
      The electrolyte solution is formed by dissolving the copper feedstock in sulfuric acid.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The electrolyte solution flows in the gaps between the anodes and cathodes, and an electric current is used to apply an effective amount of voltage across the anodes and the cathodes to deposit copper on the cathodes.
      <br/>
      The electric current can be a direct current or an alternating current with a direct current bias.
      <br/>
      The flow rate of the electrolyte solution through the gap between the anodes and the cathode is generally in the range of about 5 to about 60 gallons per minute (gpm), and in one embodiment about 20 to about 50 gpm, and in one embodiment about 30 to about 40 gpm.
      <br/>
      The electrolyte solution has a free sulfuric acid concentration generally in the range of about 10 to about 300 grams per liter, and in one embodiment about 60 to about 150 grams per liter, and in one embodiment about 70 to about 120 grams per liter.
      <br/>
      The temperature of the electrolyte solution in the electroforming cell is generally in the range of about 25 (degree)  C. to about 100 (degree)  C., and in one embodiment about 40 (degree)  C. to about 60 (degree)  C. The copper ion concentration is generally in the range of about 25 to about 125 grams per liter, and in one embodiment 60 to about 125 grams per liter, and in one embodiment about 70 to about 120 grams per liter, and in one embodiment about 90 to about 110 grams per liter.
      <br/>
      The free chloride ion concentration in the electrolyte solution is generally up to about 300 parts per million (ppm), and in one embodiment up to about 150 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 100 ppm, and in one embodiment, up to about 20 ppm.
      <br/>
      In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the free chloride ion concentration is up to about 10 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 5 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 2 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 1 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 0.5 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 0.2 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 0.1 ppm, and in one embodiment it is zero or substantially zero.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the free chloride ion concentration is in the range of about 0.01 to about 10 ppm, and in one embodiment about 0.01 ppm to about 5 ppm, and in one embodiment about 0.01 ppm to about 2 ppm, and in one embodiment about 0.01 ppm to about 1 ppm, and in one embodiment about 0.01 ppm to about 0.5 ppm, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 0.1 ppm. The impurity level is generally at a level of no more than about 50 grams per liter, and in one embodiment no more than about 20 grams per liter, and in one embodiment no more than about 10 grams per liter.
      <br/>
      The current density is generally in the range of about 10 to about 100 amps per square foot (ASF), and in one embodiment about 10 to about 50 ASF.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      During electrodeposition the electrolyte solution may optionally contain one or more active sulfur-containing materials.
      <br/>
      The term "active-sulfur containing material" refers to materials characterized generally as containing a bivalent sulfur atom both bonds of which are directly connected to a carbon atom together with one or more nitrogen atoms also directly connected to the carbon atom.
      <br/>
      In this group of compounds, the double bond may in some cases exist or alternate between the sulfur or nitrogen atom and the carbon atom.
      <br/>
      Thiourea is a useful active sulfur-containing material.
      <br/>
      The thioureas having the nucleus  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      and the iso-thiocyanates having the grouping S.dbd.C.dbd.N-- are useful.
      <br/>
      Thiosinamine (allyl thiourea) and thiosemicarbazide are also useful.
      <br/>
      The active sulfur-containing material should be soluble in the electrolyte solution and be compatible with the other constituents.
      <br/>
      The concentration of active sulfur-containing material in the electrolyte solution during electrodeposition is in one embodiment up to about 20 ppm, and in one embodiment in the range of about 0.1 to about 15 ppm.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The electrolyte solution may also optionally contain one or more gelatins.
      <br/>
      The gelatins that are useful herein are heterogeneous mixtures of water-soluble proteins derived from collagen.
      <br/>
      Animal glue is a preferred gelatin because it is relatively inexpensive, commercially available and convenient to handle.
      <br/>
      The concentration of gelatin in the electrolyte solution is generally up to about 20 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 10 ppm, and in one embodiment in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 ppm.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The electrolyte solution may also optionally contain other organic additives known in the art for controlling the properties of the electrodeposited copper.
      <br/>
      Examples include saccharin, caffeine, molasses, guar gum, gum arabic, the polyalkylene glycols (e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyisopropylene glycol, etc.), dithiothreitol, amino acids (e.g., proline, hydroxyproline, cysteine, etc.), acrylamide, sulfopropyl disulfide, tetraethylthiuram disulfide, benzyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, chlorohydroxylpropyl sulfonate, alkylene oxides (e.g., ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, etc.), the sulfonium alkane sulfonates, thiocarbamoyldisulfide, selenic acid, or a mixture of two or more thereof.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, one or more of these organic additives are used in concentrations of up to about 20 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 10 ppm.
    </p>
    <p num="20">In one embodiment, no organic additives are added to the electrolyte solution.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring now to FIG. 1, a process for electrodepositing copper plates used to make the circular disks pursuant to step (A) of the inventive process is disclosed.
      <br/>
      The apparatus used with this process includes a dissolution vessel 100, filters 102 and 104 and an electroforming cell 106.
      <br/>
      The electroforming cell 106 includes vessel 108, vertically mounted anodes 110, and vertically mounted cathodes 112.
      <br/>
      An electrolyte solution 114 is formed in dissolution vessel 100 by dissolving copper metal in sulfuric acid.
      <br/>
      The copper metal enters vessel 100, as indicated by directional arrow 116, in any conventional form which, as indicated above, includes copper shot, scrap copper metal, scrap copper wire, recycled copper, cupric oxide, cuprous oxide, and the like.
      <br/>
      The sulfuric acid entering vessel 100, as indicated by directional arrow 118, typically has a sulfuric acid concentration in the range of about 10 to about 300 grams per liter and in one embodiment about 60 to about 150 grams per liter.
      <br/>
      Electrolyte solution recycled from electroforming cell 106 also enters vessel 100 through line 120.
      <br/>
      The temperature of the electrolyte solution 114 in vessel 100 is typically in the range of about 25 (degree)  C. to about 100 (degree)  C., and in one embodiment about 40 (degree)  C. to about 60 (degree)  C. The copper feedstock is dissolved in the sulfuric acid and air to form the electrolyte solution 114.
      <br/>
      The electrolyte solution 114 is advanced from vessel 100 to vessel 108 through lines 121 and 122.
      <br/>
      The electrolyte solution 114 may be filtered in filter 102 prior to entering vessel 108 or, alternatively, it may by-pass filter 102 using line 124.
      <br/>
      The electrolyte solution 114 used in vessel 108 has the composition indicated above.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The electrolyte solution 118 flows between the anodes 110 and cathodes 112 at a rate in the range of about 5 to about 60 gpm, and in one embodiment about 20 to about 50 gpm, and in one embodiment about 30 to about 40 gpm.
      <br/>
      A voltage is applied between anodes 110 and cathodes 112 to effect electrodeposition of copper plates 130 on the cathodes.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the current that is used is a direct current, and in one embodiment it is an alternating current with a direct current bias.
      <br/>
      The current density is in the range of about 10 to about 100 ASF, and in one embodiment about 10 to about 50 ASF.
      <br/>
      Copper ions in electrolyte 114 gain electrons at the surface of cathodes 112 whereby metallic copper deposits or plates out on each side of each of the cathodes 112.
      <br/>
      Electrodeposition of copper on cathodes 112 is continued until the thickness of the deposited copper plates 130 is at a desired level which typically is in the range about 0.1 to about 1 inch, and in one embodiment about 0.1 to about 0.5 inch, and in one embodiment about 0.2 to about 0.3 inch.
      <br/>
      Electrodeposition is then discontinued.
      <br/>
      The cathodes 112 are removed from the vessel 108.
      <br/>
      The deposited copper plates 130 are stripped from the cathodes 112 using known techniques, and then washed and dried.
      <br/>
      The deposited copper is typically in the form of a square or rectangular plate 130 as illustrated in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      However, as indicated above, the deposited copper can be in the form of a circular disk.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The electrodeposition process depletes the electrolyte solution 114 of copper ions and, when used, organic additives.
      <br/>
      These ingredients are continuously replenished.
      <br/>
      Electrolyte solution 114 is withdrawn from vessel 108 through line 126 and recirculated through filter 104, line 120, dissolution vessel 100, line 121 and filter 102, and then is reintroduced into vessel 108 through line 122.
      <br/>
      Filter 104 may be by-passed through line 128.
      <br/>
      Similarly, filter 102 may be by-passed through line 124.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Organic additives may be added to the electrolyte solution 114 in either vessel 100, vessel 108 or in line 122 prior to the entry of the electrolyte solution into vessel 108.

      The addition rate for these organic additives is, in one embodiment, in the range of up to about 30 mg/min/kA, and in one embodiment about 0.1 to about 20 mg/mi/kA, and in one embodiment about 2 to about 20 mg/min/kA.

    <p num="43">
      In one embodiment, the circular disk of copper, or the copper plate used to make the circular disk, is formed in a process using solvent extraction in combination with electrodeposition.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the copper feedstock is any copper-bearing material from which copper may be extracted.
      <br/>
      These feedstocks include copper ore, smelter flue dust, copper cement, copper concentrates, copper smelter products, copper sulfate, and copper-containing waste.
      <br/>
      The term "copper-containing waste" refers to any solid or liquid waste material (e.g., garbage, sludge, effluent streams, etc.) that contains copper.
      <br/>
      These waste materials include hazardous wastes.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of wastes that can be used are copper oxides obtained from treating spent cupric chloride etchants.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The copper ore can be ore taken from an open pit mine.
      <br/>
      The ore is hauled to a heap-leaching dump which is typically built on an area underlain with a liner, such as a thick high-density polyethylene liner, to prevent loss of leaching fluids into the surrounding water shed.
      <br/>
      A typical heap-leaching dump has a surface area of, for example, about 125,000 square feet and contains approximately 110,000 tons of ore.
      <br/>
      As leaching progresses and new dumps are built on top of the old dumps, they become increasingly higher and eventually reach heights of, for example, about 250 feet or more.
      <br/>
      A network of pipes and wobbler sprinklers is laid on the surface of a newly completed dump and a weak solution of sulfuric acid is continuously sprayed at a rate of, for example, about 0.8 gallon per minute per 100 square feet of surface area.
      <br/>
      The leaching solution percolates down through the dump, dissolves copper in the ore, flows from the dump base as a copper-rich aqueous leach solution, drains into a collection pond, and is pumped to a feed pond for subsequent treatment using the inventive process.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      With some mining operations in-situ leaching is used to extract copper values from copper ore.
      <br/>
      The copper-rich leach solution obtained by this process can be used in the inventive process as the copper-bearing material.
      <br/>
      In-situ leaching is useful when reserves of acid-soluble oxide ore lie beneath an open pit area and above the depleted portion of an underground mine or when a deposit is buried too deeply to be economically developed by open pit methods.
      <br/>
      Injection wells are drilled into this zone at a depth of, for example, about 1000 feet.
      <br/>
      The wells are cased with polyvinylchloride pipe, the bottom portion of which is slotted to allow solution into the ore.
      <br/>
      A leach solution of weak sulfuric acid is injected into each well at a rate dependent upon the permeability of the zone into which it is drilled.
      <br/>
      The solution percolates down through the ore zone, dissolves the copper minerals, and drains into a prepared collection area.
      <br/>
      The collection area can be, for example, haulage drifts of the underground mine.
      <br/>
      The copper-bearing aqueous leach solution that is produced is pumped to the surface by means of a corrosion-resistant pumping system where it is available for use as the copper-bearing material for the inventive process.

      The circular disk of copper that is formed during step (A) of the inventive process is either electrodeposited directly in the form of a circular disk, or is electrodeposited in the form of a square or rectangular plate of copper which is subsequently cut using known techniques (e.g., stamping, punching, machining, etc.) to form the circular disk.
      <br/>
      The circular disk is then subjected to the metal working steps of rotating the circular disk about its center axis, feeding a cutting tool into the peripheral edge of the circular disk to cause a strip of copper to peel from the disk, slitting the strip of copper to form a plurality of strands of copper wire, and shaping the strands of copper wire to provide such strands with desired cross sectional shapes and sizes.
    </p>
    <p num="83">The peeling step of the inventive process, which includes rotating the circular disk about its center axis and feeding a cutting tool into the peripheral edge of the disk to cause a strip of copper to peel from the disk, is sometimes referred to in the art by the term "skiving."</p>

      Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the electrodeposited copper plate 130, in one embodiment, is cut using standard techniques to form circular disk 300.

      The circular disk 300 has one side that is smooth or shiny and an opposite side which has a rough or matte surface.

      <br/>
      However, in one embodiment, this machining step is eliminated.

      The slitting step of the inventive process is best illustrated with reference to FIGS. 6-8. In this step of the process, the copper strip 312 that is peeled from the circular disk 300 is slit to form a plurality of strands of wire having square or rectangular cross sections.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated embodiment depicted in FIGS. 6-8, the copper strip 312 is slit using slitter 380 to form product wire strands 402, 404, 406, 408 and 410.
      <br/>
      Scrap wire strands 400 and 412 are also formed.
      <br/>
      The sequence of this process step involves unwinding the copper strip 312 from reel 326, advancing it through accumulator 370 to tension sheave 372, and around tension sheave 372 to slitter 380.
      <br/>
      Accumulator 370 includes fixed sheave 374 and dancer sheave 376 which are provided for maintaining tension in copper strip 312 as it is advanced to slitter 380.
      <br/>
      In slitter 380, the copper strip 312 is slit to form wire strands 402, 404, 406, 408 and 410, and these wire strands are advanced from slitter 380 to product spools 382, 384, 386, 388 and 390, respectively.

      Scrap wire strands 400 and 412 are also formed in slitter 380, and these strands are advanced to spools 392 and 394, respectively.

      <br/>
      Copper wire having these characteristics can be drawn more easily than wire that does not have such characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="110">In one embodiment, the wire made by the inventive process has a copper content of about 99% to about 99.999% by weight, and in one embodiment about 99.9% to about 99.99% by weight.</p>
    <p num="111">
      In one embodiment, the wire made by the inventive process has an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) at 23 (degree)  C. in the range of about 60,000 psi to about 95,000 psi, and in one embodiment about 60,000 psi to about 85,000 psi, and in one embodiment about 65,000 psi to about 75,000 psi.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the elongations for this wire at 23 (degree)  C. are about 8% to about 18%, and in one embodiment about 9% to about 16%, and in one embodiment about 9% to about 14%.
    </p>
    <p num="112">In one embodiment, the wire made by the inventive process is cold worked to a reduction of about 60% and as such has a tensile strength in the range of about 65,000 psi to about 90,000 psi, and in one embodiment about 70,000 psi to about 75,000 psi; and an elongation about 0% to about 4%, and in one embodiment about 0% to about 2%, and in one embodiment about 1%.</p>
    <p num="113">In one embodiment, the wire made by the inventive process is cold worked to a reduction of about 60% and then annealed at a temperature of 200 (degree)  C. for two hours and as such has a tensile strength in the range of about 25,000 psi to about 40,000 psi, and in one embodiment about 27,000 psi to about 30,000 psi; and an elongation of about 30% to about 40%.</p>
    <p num="114">In one embodiment, the copper wire made by the inventive process has a conductivity of at least about 100% IACS (International Annealed Copper Standard), and in one embodiment about 100% to about 102.7% IACS.</p>
    <p num="115">
      The wire made by the inventive process can be cleaned using known chemical, mechanical or electropolishing techniques.
      <br/>
      Chemical cleaning can be effected by passing the wire through an etching or pickling bath of nitric acid or hot (e.g., about 25 (degree)  C. to 70 (degree)  C.) sulfuric acid.
      <br/>
      Electropolishing can be effected using an electric current and sulfuric acid.
      <br/>
      Mechanical cleaning can be effected using brushes and the like for removing burrs and similar roughened portions form the surface of the wire.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the wire is degreased using a caustic soda solution, washed, rinsed, pickeled using hot (e.g., about 35 (degree)  C.) sulfuric acid, electropolished using sulfuric acid, rinsed and dried.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      In one embodiment, the strands of wire made by the inventive process have lengths of up to about 100,000 feet, and in one embodiment from about 5000 to about 50,000 feet, and in one embodiment about 10,000 to about 50,000 feet.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, strands of wire made by the inventive process have relatively short lengths (e.g., about 500 to about 5000 ft, and in one embodiment about 1000 to about 3000 ft, and in one embodiment about 2000 ft), and these strands of wire can be welded to other similarly produced strands of wire using known techniques (e.g., butt welding) to produce strands of wire having relatively long lengths (e.g., lengths in excess of about 100,000 ft, or in excess of about 200,000 ft, up to about 1,000,000 ft or more).
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      An advantage of this invention is that the properties of the wire made by the inventive process can be controlled to a great extent by controlling the composition of the electrolyte solution.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, electrolyte solutions containing no organic additives and having a free chloride ion concentration of below 1 ppm, and in one embodiment zero or substantially zero, are particularly suitable for producing ultra thin copper wire (e.g., about AWG 40 to about AWG 60, and in one embodiment about AWG 50 to about AWG 60).
    </p>
    <p num="118">In one embodiment, the wire made by the inventive process is coated with one or more of the following coatings:</p>
    <p num="119">
      --
      <br/>
      -- (1)         Lead, or lead alloy (80Pb--20Sn) ASTM B189
      <br/>
      -- (2)         Nickel                         ASTM B355
      <br/>
      -- (3)         Silver                         ASTM B298
      <br/>
      -- (4)         Tin                            ASTM B33
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      These coatings are applied to (a) retain solderability for hookup-wire applications, (b) provide a barrier between the copper and insulation materials such as rubber, that would react with the copper and adhere to it (thus making it difficult to strip insulation from the wire to make an electrical connection) or (c) prevent oxidation of the copper during high-temperature service.
      <br/>
      Tin-lead alloy coatings and pure tin coatings are the most common; nickel and silver are used for specialty and high-temperature applications.
      <br/>
      The copper wire may be coated by hot dipping in a molten metal bath, electroplating or cladding.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, a continuous process is used; this permits "on line" coating following the wire-drawing operation.
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      Stranded wire may be produced by twisting or braiding several wires together to provide a flexible cable.
      <br/>
      Different degrees of flexibility for a given current-carrying capacity can be achieved by varying the number, size and arrangement of individual wires.
      <br/>
      Solid wire, concentric strand, rope strand and bunched strand provide increasing degrees of flexibility; within the last three categories, a larger number of finer wires can provide greater flexibility.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      Stranded wire and cable can be made on machines known as "bunchers" or "stranders." Conventional bunchers are used for stranding small-diameter wires (34 AWG up to 10 AWG).
      <br/>
      Individual wires are payed off reels located alongside the equipment and are fed over flyer arms that rotate about the take-up reel to twist the wires.
      <br/>
      The rotational speed of the arm relative to the take-up speed controls the length of lay in the bunch.
      <br/>
      For small, portable, flexible cables, individual wires are usually 30 to 44 AWG, and there may be as many as 30,000 wires in each cable.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      A tubular buncher, which has up to 18 wire-payoff reels mounted inside the unit, can be used.
      <br/>
      Wire is taken off each reel while it remains in a horizontal plane, is threaded along a tubular barrel and is twisted together with other wires by a rotating action of the barrel.
      <br/>
      At the take-up end, the strand passes through a closing die to form the final bunch configuration.
      <br/>
      The finished strand is wound onto a reel that also remains within the machine.
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      In one embodiment, the wire is coated or covered with an insulation or jacketing.
      <br/>
      Three types of insulation or jacketing materials can be used.
      <br/>
      These are polymeric, enamel, and paper-and-oil.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      In one embodiment, the polymers that are used are polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene, ethylene propylene rubber (EPR), silicon rubber, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP).
      <br/>
      Polyamide coatings are used where fire-resistance is of prime importance, such as in wiring harnesses for manned space vehicles.
      <br/>
      Natural rubber can be used.
      <br/>
      Synthetic rubbers can be used wherever good flexibility must be maintained, such as in welding or mining cable.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      Many varieties of PVC are useful.
      <br/>
      These include several that are flame-resistant.
      <br/>
      PVC has good dielectric strength and flexibility, and is particularly useful because it is one of the least expensive conventional insulating and jacketing materials.
      <br/>
      It is used mainly for communication wire, control cable, building wire and low-voltage power cables.
      <br/>
      PVC insulation is normally selected for applications requiring continuous operation at low temperatures up to about 75 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      Polyethylene, because of its low and stable dielectric constant, is useful when better electrical properties are required.
      <br/>
      It resists abrasion and solvents.
      <br/>
      It is used chiefly for hookup wire, communication wire and high-voltage cable.
      <br/>
      Cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE), which is made by adding organic peroxides to polyethylene and then vulcanizing the mixture, yields better heat-resistance, better mechanical properties, better aging characteristics, and freedom from environmental stress cracking.
      <br/>
      Special compounding can provide flame-resistance in cross-linked polyethylene.
      <br/>
      The usual maximum sustained operating temperature is about 90 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      PTFE and FEP are used to insulate jet aircraft wire, electronic equipment wire and specialty control cables, where heat resistance, solvent resistance and high reliability are important.
      <br/>
      These electrical cables can operate at temperatures up to about 250 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      These polymeric compounds can be applied over the wire using extrusion.
      <br/>
      The extruders are machines that convert pellets or powders of thermoplastic polymers into continuous covers.
      <br/>
      The insulating compound is loaded into a hopper that feeds it into a long, heated chamber.
      <br/>
      A continuously revolving screw moves the pellets into the hot zone, where the polymer softens and becomes fluid.
      <br/>
      At the end of the chamber, molten compound is forced out through a small die over the moving wire, which also passes through the die opening.
      <br/>
      As the insulated wire leaves the extruder it is water-cooled and taken up on reels.
      <br/>
      Wire jacketed with EPR and XLPE preferably go through a vulcanizing chamber prior to cooling to complete the cross-linking process.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      Film-coated wire, usually fine magnet wire, generally comprises a copper wire coated with a thin, flexible enamel film.
      <br/>
      These insulated copper wires are used for electromagnetic coils in electrical devices, and must be capable of withstanding high breakdown voltages.
      <br/>
      Temperature ratings range from about 105 (degree)  C. to about 220 (degree)  C., depending on enamel composition.
      <br/>
      Useful enamels are based on polyvinyl acetals, polyesters and epoxy resins.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      The equipment for enamel coating the wire is designed to insulate large numbers of wires simultaneously.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, wires are passed through an enamel applicator that deposits a controlled thickness of liquid enamel onto the wire.
      <br/>
      Then the wire travels through a series of ovens to cure the coating, and finished wire is collected on spools.
      <br/>
      In order to build up a heavy coating of enamel, it may be necessary to pass wires through the system several times.
      <br/>
      Powder-coating methods are also useful.
      <br/>
      These avoid evolution of solvents, which is characteristic of curing conventional enamels, and thus make it easier for the manufacturer to meet OSHA and EPA standards.
      <br/>
      Electrostatic sprayers, fluidized beds and the like can be used to apply such powdered coatings.
