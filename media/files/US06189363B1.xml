    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to a cooling device, and more particularly to a molding tool for manufacturing the cooling device.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      As shown in FIG. 1, a prior art cooling device 1 is intended for use in a CPU (central processing unit) and is formed of a base 3.
      <br/>
      The base 3 is provided with a plurality of cooling fins 4.
      <br/>
      Now referring to FIG. 2, a prior art molding tool 7 is shown for manufacturing the cooling fins 8 by extrusion molding.
      <br/>
      In the process of making the cooling fins, the structural strength of the molding tool 7 must be taken into consideration in relation to the pressure of the extrusion molding.
      <br/>
      The ratio of height (H) and width (W) of the cooling fins 8, as well as the distance (D) between the two cooling fins 8 must be kept in an appropriate range.
      <br/>
      If the cooling fins 8 are too thin, the molding tool 7 is susceptible to damage in the extrusion molding.
      <br/>
      If the cooling fins 8 are excessively thick, there will be less cooling fins 8 to result in a reduction in the cooling area.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a molding tool for manufacturing a cooling device having a plurality of cooling fins capable of removing heat effectively.</p>
    <p num="4">
      In keeping with the principle of the present invention, the foregoing objective of the present invention is attained by a molding tool comprising a lower mold, a lower mold housing, a punching head, and an urging plate.
      <br/>
      The lower mold is provided with a plurality of through holes.
      <br/>
      The lower mold housing is provided with a molding hole and is fixed on the lower mold such that the molding hole is corresponding in location to the through holes of the lower mold.
      <br/>
      The punching head is fastened with the bottom of the upper mold seat of a punching machine and is provided with a plurality of cavities and ribbed slots.
      <br/>
      The urging plate is provided with an opening and is disposed under the upper mold seat of the punching machine such that the punching head is put through the opening.
      <br/>
      The urging plate is further provided at the bottom thereof with an insertion slot extending along edge of the opening.
      <br/>
      A blank is first kept in the molding hole of the lower mold housing and is then extruded by the punching head to form a plurality of cooling fins in the through holes of the lower mold.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, a molding tool 10 embodied in the present invention is intended for use in making a cooling device having a plurality of cooling fins.
      <br/>
      The molding tool 10 comprises a lower mold 11, a lower mold housing 15, a punching head 21, and an urging plate 31.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The lower mold 11 is mounted on the lower mold seat 81 of a punching machine (not shown in the drawings) and is provided with a plurality of through holes 12.</p>
    <p num="8">
      The lower mold housing 15 is provided at the center thereof with a molding hole 16.
      <br/>
      The lower mold housing 15 is mounted on the lower mold 11 such that the molding hole 16 is corresponding in location to the through holes 12 of the lower mold 11.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The punching head 21 has a cross-sectional profile which is corresponding to the molding hole 16.
      <br/>
      The punching head 21 is provided in the bottom edge of the periphery thereof with a plurality of cavities 23 and ribbed slots 24.
      <br/>
      The cavities 23 are biased and have an arcuate cross section.
      <br/>
      The ribbed slots 24 are biased.
      <br/>
      The punching head 21 is mounted securely at the bottom of an upper mold seat 83 of the punching machine such that the punching head 21 is received in the molding hole 16 at the time when the punching head 21 is driven downward.
      <br/>
      When the punching head 21 is received in the molding hole 16, the punching head 21 does not come in contact with the inner wall of the molding hole 16.
      <br/>
      In the meantime, the underside of the punching head 21 is kept apart from the top of the lower mold 11 by a predetermined distance.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The urging plate 31 is provided at the center thereof with an opening 33 and is disposed under the upper mold seat 83 of the punching machine such that the punching head 21 is put through the urging plate 31 via the opening 33.
      <br/>
      The urging plate 31 is provided at the bottom thereof with an insertion slot 35 extending along the edge of the opening 33.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      As illustrated in FIG. 5, the process of making the cooling device by the molding tool 10 of the present invention involves a first step in which a blank 91, such as an aluminium block, is placed in the molding hole 16 of the lower mold housing 15.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the upper mold seat 83 of the punching machine is driven downward such that the punching head 21 is forced into the molding hole 16, as shown in FIG. 6, and that the underside of the urging plate 31 presses against the top of the lower mold housing 15.
      <br/>
      As a result, a base plate 92 is formed by the blank 91 such that the base plate 92 is located between the punching head 21 and the lower mold 11.
      <br/>
      In the meantime, a plurality of cooling fins 94 are integrally made with the base plate 92 by the through holes 12 of the lower mold 11.
      <br/>
      A smooth ring 96 is integrally formed with the base plate 92 between the punching head 21 and the inner wall of the molding hole 16 of the lower mold housing 15.
      <br/>
      A plurality of insertion hooks 97 are formed of the blank 91 such that the insertion hooks 97 are corresponding in location to the cavities 23 of the punching head 21.
      <br/>
      In addition, a plurality of reinforcing ribs 98, as shown in FIG. 8, are formed such that the reinforcing ribs 98 are corresponding in location to the ribbed slots 24 of the punching head 21.
      <br/>
      Moreover, an insertion flat part 99 is formed such that the insertion flat part 99 is corresponding in location to the insertion slot 35 of the urging plate 31.
      <br/>
      An unfinished cooling device 100 is thus made by the molding tool 10 of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      As shown in FIG. 7, upon completion of the production of the unfinished cooling device 100, the upper mold seat 83 of the punching machine, the punching head 21 and the urging plate 31 are displaced upward to lift the punching head 21 along with the unfinished device 100 in view of the insertion hooks 97 being engaged with the cavities 23 of the punching head 21.
      <br/>
      In light of the insertion flat part 99 being retained in the insertion slot 35 of the urging plate 31, the insertion flat part 99 is held securely to prevent the smooth ring 96 from expanding outwards at the time when the unfinished device 100 is lifted.
      <br/>
      As a result, the unfinished device 100 is held securely by the punching head 21.
      <br/>
      The reinforcing ribs 98 are intended to reinforce the structure of the smooth ring 96.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As shown in FIG. 8, the cooling fins 94 of the unfinished device 100 are so trimmed that they are flush.
      <br/>
      The smooth ring 96 is subsequently cut off.
      <br/>
      A finished device 110 is thus produced and shown in FIG. 9.
    </p>
    <p num="14">As shown in FIG. 10, a molding tool 50 of the second preferred embodiment of the present invention is basically similar in construction to the molding tool 10 of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention, with the difference being that the former comprises a punching head 61 which is provided in the periphery thereof with a stepped portion 62 and is further provided in the bottom edge of the periphery thereof with a plurality of cavities 63 and ribbed slots (not shown in the drawing), and further that the former comprises an urging plate 71 which is devoid of the insertion slot.</p>
    <p num="15">As shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, in the extrusion process of making a cooling device by the molding tool 50 of the second preferred embodiment of the present invention, a receiving space 79 is formed by the stepped portion 62 between the punching head 61 and the urging plate 71 and is used to form an insertion flat part 99' at the top of the smooth ring 96' of the periphery of the base plate 92'. The insertion flat part 99' is similar in function to the insertion flat part 99 as described above.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The embodiments of the present invention described above are to be regarded in all respects as being merely illustrative and not restrictive.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without deviating from the spirit thereof.
      <br/>
      For example, the urging plate 31 of the molding tool of the present invention may be provided with one insertion slot 35 extending along the edge of the opening 33, two insertion slots 35 which are located in two opposite sides of the opening 30, or four insertion slots 35 which are located in four sides of the opening 33.
      <br/>
      The present invention is therefore to be limited only by the scopes of the following appended claims.
