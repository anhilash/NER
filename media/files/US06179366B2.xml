      A sunshade mounting clip assembly for a vehicle includes a mounting clip adapted to be disposed adjacent a headliner covering a roof of a vehicle for cooperating with a sunshade.
      <br/>
      The mounting clip has a shaft extending outwardly therefrom.
      <br/>
      The sunshade mounting clip assembly also includes a mounting support adapted to be disposed adjacent the headliner on a side opposite the mounting clip and having an aperture extending therethrough to receive the shaft.
      <br/>
      The sunshade mounting clip assembly further includes a retainer disposed adjacent the mounting support having an aperture to receive the shaft and preventing the shaft from exiting the mounting support.
      <br/>
      The mounting support extends laterally and longitudinally to form a footprint greater than a footprint of the retainer.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      It is known to provide a sunshade or visor for a vehicle such as a sport utility vehicle or a pick-up truck.
      <br/>
      Typically, the sunshade is rectangular in shape and pivotally attached at one end to a headliner of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The sunshade also includes a mounting clip having a C-shaped recess mounted to the headliner to removably receive the other end of the sunshade.
      <br/>
      The mounting clip is typically attached to the headliner by screws extending through the mounting clip in combination with metal spacers, seals and clips to accomplish the attachment.

      Although the above has worked, it is desirable to provide a new mounting clip for a sunshade.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to provide a sunshade mounting clip that can be used with different types of substrates.
      <br/>
      It is further desirable to provide a sunshade mounting clip that does not rotate and is self-aligned for assembly.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a need in the art to provide a sunshade mounting clip assembly for a vehicle.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">It is, therefore, one object of the present invention to provide a sunshade mounting clip assembly for a vehicle.</p>
    <p num="5">It is another object to provide a sunshade mounting clip assembly for a vehicle that requires a low insertion force.</p>
    <p num="6">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a sunshade mounting clip assembly that does not rotate and is self-aligned for assembly.</p>
    <p num="7">
      To achieve the foregoing objects, the present invention is a sunshade mounting clip assembly for a vehicle.
      <br/>
      The sunshade mounting clip assembly includes a mounting clip adapted to be disposed adjacent a headliner covering a roof of a vehicle for cooperating with a sunshade.
      <br/>
      The mounting clip has a shaft extending outwardly therefrom.
      <br/>
      The sunshade mounting clip assembly also includes a mounting support adapted to be disposed adjacent the headliner on a side opposite the mounting clip and having an aperture extending therethrough to receive the shaft.
      <br/>
      The sunshade mounting clip assembly further includes a retainer disposed adjacent the mounting support having an aperture to receive the shaft and preventing the shaft from exiting the mounting support.
      <br/>
      The mounting support extends laterally and longitudinally to form a footprint greater than a footprint of the retainer.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      One advantage of the present invention is that a sunshade mounting clip assembly is provided for a vehicle.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the present invention is that the sunshade mounting clip assembly has a mounting support formed as a single piece keyed for correct orientation for a vehicle.
      <br/>
      Yet another advantage of the present invention is that the sunshade mounting clip assembly has the mounting support made from a non-corrosive material.
      <br/>
      Still another advantage of the present invention is that the sunshade mounting clip assembly has anti-rotation tabs and self-aligning tabs which reduce assembly time and mis-builds.
      <br/>
      A further advantage of the present invention is that the sunshade mounting clip assembly can be used with different types of substrates and requires a low insertion force to install final assembly, eliminating insertion problems due to over-tightening.
      <br/>
      Yet a further advantage of the present invention is that the sunshade mounting clip assembly improves quality due to easier installation and reduces and/or eliminates mis-installs (loose assemblies) due to clips not being seated.
      <br/>
      Still a further advantage of the present invention is that the sunshade mounting clip assembly reduces cost, resulting from fewer warranty issues and less repairs from mis-installs.

      The projections 50 prevent rotation of the mounting support 48 once the mounting support 48 is attached to the headliner 26 by engagement with the panel 30 as illustrated in FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Once the mounting clip assembly 10 is pre-assembled to the headliner 26, the headliner 26 is moved toward the roof 18 and roof rail 22 to extend the retainer 58 through the opening 25 and into the space 24 of the roof rail 22.
      <br/>
      The retainer legs 72 deflect inwardly as the retainer 58 is extended through the opening 25 and return to their original position once the retainer legs 72 are disposed in the space 24 of the flange 74, having passed through the opening 25.
      <br/>
      The flanges 74 prevent the retainer 58 from exiting the roof rail 22.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 3, the headliner 26 and sunshade mounting clip assembly 10 are installed in a secured position to the vehicle body 14.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that an operator (not shown) reaches through a side door window of the vehicle body 14 and pushes upward to snap in the sunshade mounting clip assembly 10 into the roof rail 22.
      <br/>
      It should also be appreciated that the sunshade mounting clip assembly 10 eliminates the need for a tool and reduces the efforts of the operator.
