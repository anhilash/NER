    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention generally relates to the treatment of cancer, and, more specifically, to the treatment of solid tumors, including their metastases, without radiation, surgery or standard chemotherapeutic agents.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Therapy for cancer has largely involved the use of radiation, surgery and chemotherapeutic agents.
      <br/>
      However, results with these measures, while beneficial in some tumors, has had only marginal or no effect in many others.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, these approaches have often unacceptable toxicity.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Both radiation and surgery suffer from the same theoretical drawback.
      <br/>
      It has been recognized that, given that a single clonogenic malignant cell can give rise to sufficient progeny to kill the host, the entire population of neoplastic cells must be eradicated.
      <br/>
      See generally, Goodman and Gilman The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (Pergamon Press, 8th Edition) (pp. 1202-1204).
      <br/>
      This concept of "total cell kill" implies that total excision of a tumor is necessary for a surgical approach, and complete destruction of all cancer cells is needed in a radiation approach, if one is to achieve a cure.
      <br/>
      In practice this is rarely possible; indeed, where there are metastases, it is impossible.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The term "chemotherapy" simply means the treatment of disease with chemical substances.
      <br/>
      The father of chemotherapy, Paul Ehrlich, imagined the perfect chemotherapeutic as a "magic bullet;" such a compound would kill invading organisms without harming the host.
      <br/>
      This target specificity is sought in all types of chemotherapeutics, including anticancer agents.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      However, specificity has been the major problem with anticancer agents.
      <br/>
      In the case of anticancer agents, the drug needs to distinguish between host cells that are cancerous and host cells that are not cancerous.
      <br/>
      The vast bulk of anticancer drugs are indiscriminate at this level.
      <br/>
      Typically anticancer agents have negative hematological effects (e.g., cessation of mitosis and disintegration of formed elements in marrow and lymphoid tissues), and immunosuppressive action (e.g., depressed cell counts), as well as a severe impact on epithelial tissues (e.g., intestinal mucosa), reproductive tissues (e.g., impairment of spermatogenesis), and the nervous system. P. Calabresi and B. A. Chabner, In: Goodman and Gilman The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (Pergamon Press, 8th Edition) (pp. 1209-1216).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Success with chemotherapeutics as anticancer agents has also been hampered by the phenomenon of multiple drug resistance, resistance to a wide range of structurally unrelated cytotoxic anticancer compounds. J. H. Gerlach et al., Cancer Surveys, 5:25-46 (1986).
      <br/>
      The underlying cause of progressive drug resistance may be due to a small population of drug-resistant cells within the tumor (e.g., mutant cells) at the time of diagnosis. J. H. Goldie and Andrew J. Coldman, Cancer Research, 44:3643-3653 (1984).
      <br/>
      Treating such a tumor with a single drug first results in a remission, where the tumor shrinks in size as a result of the killing of the predominant drug-sensitive cells.
      <br/>
      With the drug-sensitive cells gone, the remaining drug-resistant cells continue to multiply and eventually dominate the cell population of the tumor.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Treatment at the outset with a combination of drugs was proposed as a solution, given the small probability that two or more different drug resistances would arise spontaneously in the same cell. V. T. DeVita, Jr., Cancer, 51:1209-1220 (1983).
      <br/>
      However, it is now known that drug resistance is due to a membrane transport protein, "P-glycoprotein," that can confer general drug resistance. M. M. Gottesman and I. Pastan, Trends in Pharmacological Science, 9:54-58 (1988).
      <br/>
      Phenotypically, the tumor cells show, over time, a reduced cellular accumulation of all drugs.
      <br/>
      In short, combination chemotherapy appears not to be the answer.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      What is needed is a specific anticancer approach that is reliably tumoricidal to a wide variety of tumor types.
      <br/>
      Importantly, the treatment must be effective with minimal host toxicity.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The invention generally relates to the treatment of cancer, and, more specifically, to the treatment of solid tumors, including their metastases, without radiation, surgery or standard chemotherapeutic agents.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the invention involves using superantigens, including SEA and SEB, to stimulate tumor draining lymph node cells ex vivo, allowing them to differentiate into tumor specific immune effector cells.
      <br/>
      The cells are then reintroduced into the same host to mediate anticancer therapeutic effects.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the stimulated cells are introduced into a different host.
      <br/>
      In still a third embodiment, the cells are established as a cell line for continuous anticancer use.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In one embodiment, lymphocytes are obtained early in life from cancer-free hosts.
      <br/>
      The cells are stored in appropriate containers under liquid nitrogen using conventional techniques (e.g., DMSO, culture media, fetal calf serum, etc.) until the onset of disease.
      <br/>
      At this point, the cells may be thawed, and cultured and stimulated in the manner of the present invention for reinfusion.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Alternatively, an established cell line may be made from cancer-free hosts.
      <br/>
      The cell line can be stored as above.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, they may be passed continuously in culture until use.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The ex vivo stimulation method has decided advantages over direct intravenous injection of superantigens, namely: 1) the superantigens are ensured of contacting their appropriate target cell, namely, T lymphocytes; in other words, stimulation is specific; 2) stimulation in culture allows for the removal of the stimulating antigens prior to reintroduction of the cells in the host, i.e., the host is exposed to only very small amounts of superantigens in vivo; and 3) lack of systemic exposure to the stimulating antigens precludes significant interference with naturally occurring or induced antibodies to superantigens.</p>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention demonstrates that superantigens can reliably produce tumoricidal reactions to a wide variety of tumor types.
      <br/>
      Moreover, success is achieved with minimal host toxicity using the in vitro sensitization technique.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In its simplest form, the present invention offers a method for inducing a tumoricidal reaction in vivo comprising contacting cells with superantigens ex vivo and infusing them into a tumor-bearing host.
      <br/>
      The cells are typically hematopoietic cells, such as peripheral blood lymphocytes, spleen cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or lymph node cells.
      <br/>
      Where they are lymph node cells, it is preferred that they are from a tumor-bearing host.
      <br/>
      The superantigens may comprise enterotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus, or synthetic polypeptides with substantial structural homology and statistically significant sequence homology to natural superantigens.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention offers a method of human cancer treatment comprising: a) providing a human cancer patient; b) obtaining hematopoietic cells from said patient; c) contacting said cells ex vivo with one or more superantigens to generate stimulated cells; and d) re-introducing said stimulated cells into said patient so as to induce an in vivo therapeutic, tumoricidal reaction.
      <br/>
      Preferably the hematopoietic cells are cultured in culture media containing enterotoxins and the cultured cells are washed prior to re-introducing said stimulated cells into said patient so as to essentially avoid introducing enterotoxins in vivo.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The culture cells can be viewed as a reagent for treating cancer, comprising T cells sensitized to a growing tumor and stimulated with superantigens.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the T cells are suspended in media suitable for intravenous administration to a human cancer patient, such as a media comprising a physiological buffered saline solution.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      While not limited to any mechanism, it is believed that culturing the cells in the manner proposed results in subset enrichment.
      <br/>
      In this regard, the present invention provides a method of human cancer treatment comprising: a) providing a human cancer patient, having one or more growing tumors; b) obtaining V BETA -expressing T cells from said patient that are sensitized to said growing tumor; c) culturing said T cells in a first culture media, said media comprising one or more superantigens so as to specifically stimulate a subset of V BETA -expressing T cells; d) culturing said T cells in a second culture media, said media comprising human interleukin 2 so as to cause cell proliferation, thereby increasing the number of cells in said culture; and e) re-introducing at least a portion of said T cells into said patient so as to induce an in vivo therapeutic, tumoricidal reaction.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the method further comprises the step of administering human interleukin 2 to said patient in vivo after re-introducing said cells in step (e).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      For culturing, the superantigen may comprise the enterotoxin SEB at concentrations above approximately 0.010  MU g/ml.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the first culture media contains SEB at a concentration of approximately 2  MU g/ml or greater and the second culture media contains human interleukin 2 at concentrations above 2 international units per milliliter.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">
      The invention generally relates to the treatment of cancer, and more specifically, the treatment of solid tumors, including their metastases, without radiation, surgery or standard chemotherapeutic agents.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the invention involves a method wherein host cells are removed and stimulated outside the body, i.e., ex vivo, with stimulating antigens (see FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      These stimulated cells are later reintroduced into the same host to mediate anticancer effects.
      <br/>
      When administered to subjects having tumors, the stimulated cells induce a tumoricidal reaction resulting in tumor regression.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      It should be understood that the term, "tumoricidal reaction," as used herein, means that the tumor cells are killed, and is not meant to be limited to any particular method by which tumor cells are killed.
      <br/>
      For example, it may be that the tumor cells are killed directly (e.g., cell-cell interaction) or indirectly (e.g., release of cytokines like interferon) by the reinfused, stimulated cells.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the stimulated cells, while not secreting cytokines themselves, may cause changes in paracrine growth signals.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      With respect to the latter, it is known that metastatic cells receive and process negative paracrine growth signals, e.g., from molecules in the transforming growth factory- BETA  family of cytokines.
      <br/>
      In conjunction with positive growth factors, the negative growth factors could determine metastatic cell growth at particular sites.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In one embodiment, the stimulating antigens are selected from among the staphylococcal enterotoxins.
      <br/>
      The staphylococcal enterotoxins and toxic shock syndrome toxin, have extraordinary properties as T cell antigens.
      <br/>
      Like other antigens, T cell stimulation by these toxins is believed to be dependent upon presentation by Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC) molecules.
      <br/>
      In contrast to conventional antigens, however, they apparently do not require presentation by a "self" MHC molecule; allogeneic antigen-presenting cells are equally effective.
      <br/>
      It is thought that the essential requirement is that cells presenting the toxins express MHC class II molecules, as these molecules specifically bind the toxins.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The staphylococcal toxins are believed not to be "processed" within antigen-presenting cells to oligopeptides that are displayed to T cells within the class II antigen-binding groove.
      <br/>
      Instead, it is postulated that the intact protein binds outside the groove and interacts directly with T cell receptors for antigen.
      <br/>
      Most importantly, there is evidence that the staphylococcal toxins bind to a site on the V BETA  segment of the T cell receptor heterodimer that is distinct from the complex site for binding of self MHC and foreign peptide antigen.
      <br/>
      Because the toxins do not bind to a site constituted by the full array of V BETA , D BETA , J BETA , V ALPHA , and J ALPHA  gene products, the frequency of T cells responding to these molecules exceeds that of conventional peptide antigens by several orders of magnitude.
      <br/>
      Hence their name, "superantigens."
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Antitumor effects may reside in specific subsets of T cells with V BETA  phenotypes which may or may not have had prior exposure to tumor.
      <br/>
      These clones may have been deleted in the course of life by an antigenic stimulus or they may be genetically absent.
      <br/>
      Superantigens have the capacity to activate selective V BETA  subsets and expand their numbers significantly, alone or together with IL-2.
      <br/>
      This stimulation may be carried out ex vivo with T cells presensitized to the tumor in vitro or in vivo, and simultaneously or sequentially incubated with various superantigens.
      <br/>
      These stimulated T cell subsets can be collected selectively (e.g., with a fluorescent or magnetic cell sorter), expanded in numbers with agents such as IL-2 and reinfused into the host, producing a tumoricidal reaction.
      <br/>
      It is possible that not one but several V BETA  clones expanded by superantigens may work additively or synergistically to enhance the antitumor effect.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      It is possible that certain V BETA  subsets may exert suppressor effects on the tumoricidal activity.
      <br/>
      Optimal antitumor effects might be obtained after expansion of the V BETA  clones having antitumor activity and depletion of the V BETA  clones having suppressor activity, followed by reinfusion of the cells into the host.
      <br/>
      Selection of the V BETA  clone to be expanded can be obtained by analysis of V BETA  profiles of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as well as from lymph node and peripheral blood V BETA  T cell profiles.
      <br/>
      Cytotoxic or tumoricidal activity in vitro of a given V BETA  subset or enrichment of a V BETA  subset at a specific tumor location following parenteral administration in vivo might also assist in identification of the V BETA  subsets with antitumor activity.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Tumor specific V BETA  subsets may show different cytokine secreting profiles depending on the superantigen employed for stimulation.
      <br/>
      A preponderance of interferon  GAMMA  production by tumor specific T cells stimulated by a given superantigen may render these cells more potent tumoricidal agents, compared to another V BETA  subset stimulated by a different superantigen.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      It is not intended that the invention be limited by the origin or nature of the host cells.
      <br/>
      Preferably, they are hematopoietic cells, such as immune cells (e.g., tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) or cells capable of developing into immune cells.
      <br/>
      While they may be isolated from a variety of sources, such as bone marrow (e.g., from femurs by aspiration), spleen or peripheral blood (e.g., collected with heparin and separated by Ficoll/hypaque gradient), as well as from the tumor (e.g., tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes).
      <br/>
      It is preferred that they are obtained from the lymph nodes.
      <br/>
      While they may be obtained from normal, disease-free donors, it is also preferred that they be obtained from tumor-bearing hosts.
    </p>
    <heading>TUMOR-DRAINING LYMPH NODES</heading>
    <p num="30">
      It has been known that tumor draining lymph nodes contain T cells specifically sensitized to the growing tumor, although such cells are insufficient to mediate an antitumor response.
      <br/>
      These cells, termed "pre-effector" cells, can differentiate into functional immune cells upon further in vitro stimulation.
      <br/>
      Several culture techniques have been developed for successful generation of antitumor effector cells from tumor draining lymph nodes. S. Shu et al., J. Immun., 139:295-304 (1987). B. Ward et al., J. Immun., 141:1047-1053 (1988). T. Chou et al., J. Immun., 141:1775-1781 (1988).
      <br/>
      Initially, irradiated tumor cells were used to drive the maturation of draining lymph node cells, and, more recently, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and IL-2 were used. H. Yoshizawa et al., J. Immun., 147:729-737 (1991).
      <br/>
      However, the results reveal less than complete killing.
      <br/>
      While not limited by an understanding of the mechanism, this may be due to polyclonal stimulation with the particular stimulating agents used, i.e., generation of a significant proportion of immune cells with irrelevant specificity.
    </p>
    <heading>SUPERANTIGENS AS STIMULATING AGENTS</heading>
    <p num="31">
      The approach of the present invention is to use more effective stimulating agents.
      <br/>
      Again, while not limited by an understanding of the mechanism, it is believed that so-called "superantigens" are capable of selectively activating subsets of T cells responsible for mediating the desired immune response.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Among the best studied superantigens are enterotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus.
      <br/>
      These superantigens are single chain proteins with molecular weights ranging from 22,000 to 38,000, and more particularly between 24,000 and 30,000.
      <br/>
      They are heat stable and resistant to trypsin digestion (the general properties of the enterotoxins are given in Table 1A and 1B).
      <br/>
      According to one aspect of the present invention, enterotoxins isolated from media which are supporting the growth of various Staphylococcus aureus organisms are used.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The enterotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus form a group of serologically distinct extracellular proteins, designated A, B, C1, C2, C3, D, E and F. These proteins are recognized as the causative agents of Staphylococcal food poisoning.
      <br/>
      Enterotoxin F appears to be important in the pathogenesis of the Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      It is not intended that the present invention be limited by the origin or nature of the particular enterotoxin.
      <br/>
      Indeed, synthetic polypeptides with substantial structural homology and with statistically significant sequence homology and similarity to Staphylococcal enterotoxins and Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins, including alignment of cysteine residues and similar hydropathy profiles, may also be effective stimulants ex vivo to induce a tumoricidal reaction when the stimulated cells are reinfused.
      <br/>
      In addition to enterotoxins, such peptides might be derived from, but are not limited to sequences in additional superantigens such as minor lymphocyte stimulating loci, mycoplasma and mycobacterial, Yersinia and Streptococcal Protein M antigens, heat shock proteins, stress peptides, and mammary tumor viruses.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The protein sequences and immunological cross- reactivity of the enterotoxins reveal that they can be divided into two related groups.
      <br/>
      The Staphylococcal enterotoxins A, E and D (SEA, SEE and SED) constitute one group, and Staphylococcal enterotoxins B and C (SEB, SEC) and Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA) make up the second group.
      <br/>
      Amino acid sequences show that SEA and SEE are almost identical and that SEB, SEC and SPEA share regions of similar sequence (amino acid sequence similarities and congruences are given in Tables 2-4).
      <br/>
      SED is moderately related to both groups although it is more similar to the SEA group.
      <br/>
      There is a striking amino acid similarity among enterotoxins A, B, C, D and E in the region immediately downstream from cysteine located at residue 106 in SEA.
      <br/>
      A second region at residue 147 also shows a highly conserved sequence.

Single letter abbreviations for the amino acid residues are: A, Ala; C, Cys; D, Asp; E, Glu; F, Phe; G, Gly; H, His; I Ile; K, Lys; L, Leu; M, Met; N, Asn; P, Pro; Q, Gln; R, Arg; S, Ser; T, Thr; V, Val; W, Trp; and Y, Tyr.</p>

      It should be noted that the two Streptococcal toxins SPEA and C are about as similar to each of the Staphylococcal groups as they are to each other.
      <br/>
      Exfoliative toxins (ETA, ETB) are of similar size to SEB and SEA with similar modes of action.
      <br/>
      They share several points of sequence similarity to the Staphylococcal enterotoxins.
      <br/>
      Overall there are several stretches at which similarities are apparent throughout the total group comprised of Staphylococcal enterotoxins, Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins and Staphylococcal exfoliative toxins.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The recognition that the biologically active regions of the enterotoxins and SPEA were substantially structurally homologous enables one to predict synthetic polypeptide compounds which will exhibit similar tumoricidal effects.
      <br/>
      Table 6 illustrates the amino acid sequence homology of mature SPEA and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B. The top sequence is the SPEA-derived amino acid sequence.
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequence of enterotoxin B is on the bottom.
      <br/>
      Sequences are numbered from the amino acid terminus, with amino acids represented by standard one character designations (see Table 5).

      One common methodology for evaluating sequence homology, and more importantly statistically significant similarities, is to use a Monte Carlo analysis using an algorithm written by Lipman and Pearson to obtain a Z value.
      <br/>
      According to this analysis, a Z value greater than 6 indicates probable significance, and a Z value greater than 10 is considered to be statistically significant. W. R. Pearson and D. J. Lipman, Proc.

    <p num="47">In the present invention, synthetic polypeptides useful in tumoricidal therapy and in blocking or destroying autoreactive T and B lymphocyte populations are characterized by substantial structural homology to enterotoxin A, enterotoxin B and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins with statistically significant sequence homology and similarity (Z value of Lipman and Pearson algorithm in Monte Carlo analysis exceeding 6) to include alignment of cysteine residues and similar hydropathy profiles.</p>
    <heading>TOXICITY OF SUPERANTIGENS</heading>
    <p num="48">
      Previous approaches utilizing superantigens in cancer therapy have involved systemic exposure to these agents.
      <br/>
      Such early approaches include both plasma perfusion over a solid support matrix containing superantigens �D. S. Terman et al., New Eng. J. Med., 305:1195 (1981)� as well as direct injection of superantigens into a tumor-bearing host. D. S. Terman, patent application Ser.

    <p num="49">
      It is believed that all enterotoxins are capable of inducing fever and shock when given systemically (e.g., intravenously).
      <br/>
      When administered in this manner, they are presumed to finction by affecting emetic receptors in the abdominal viscera which stimulate the emetic and diarrheal response.
      <br/>
      They are also believed to induce interferon, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukins 1 and 2.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Unfortunately, the increased effectiveness of higher doses of systemically introduced superantigens is correlated with higher toxicity.
      <br/>
      In this regard, direct administration of increasingly effective, anti-cancer doses in animals has been followed by shock and death within 12-24 hours.

      The present invention contemplates avoiding the undesirable effects, but nonetheless harnessing the valuable characteristics of superantigens.
      <br/>
      Preferably, there is no significant systemic exposure to superantigens using the ex vivo stimulation approach of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      It should be noted that the ex vivo approach also allows for the presence of minor impurities in the preparation that would be unacceptable in preparations for direct administration.
      <br/>
      While these impurities might be toxic (or even lethal) in vivo, they can simply be washed away along with the superantigen itself following ex vivo culture.
    </p>
    <p num="55">In sum, the criteria for superantigens, and in particular, superantigen purity are: 1) mitogenic activity in a tritiated thymidine proliferation assay, 2) stimulation of interferon release, 3) V BETA  cell reactivity, 4) amino acid profile (see above), 5) HPLC and PAGE (21-28,000 MW); 6) negative in the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test for endotoxin; 7) negative in a hemolytic assay for the presence of alpha-hemolysin.</p>
    <heading>EX VIVO STIMULATION</heading>
    <p num="56">
      As noted above, a number of cell types can be used.
      <br/>
      When cells from lymph nodes are used, all types of lymph nodes are contemplated (inguinal, mesenteric, superficial distal auxiliary, etc.).
      <br/>
      For ex vivo stimulation, they are removed aseptically and single cell suspensions are prepared by teasing under sterile conditions.
      <br/>
      Cell preparations then may be filtered (e.g., through a layer of nylon mesh), centrifuged and subjected to a gentle lysing procedure, if necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Tumor-draining lymph node cells may be stimulated in vitro using a number of protocols.
      <br/>
      For example, a sufficiently large number of lymph node cells (i.e., a number adequate to show a tumoricidal reaction upon reinfusion) are exposed to superantigens (e.g., SEA, SEB, etc.) and diluted in synthetic culture media (e.g., RPMI 1640 with typical supplements) for the appropriate period of time (e.g., two days).
      <br/>
      Any number of standard culture techniques can be employed (e.g., 24-well plates in an incubator at 37 (degree)  C. in a 5% CO2 atmosphere).
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Following the incubation, the stimulated cells are harvested and washed with synthetic media containing no superantigens.
      <br/>
      At this point, the cells may be cultured further with other agents if desired (e.g., IL-2).
      <br/>
      In any event, the cells are counted to determine the degree of proliferation and resuspended in appropriate media for therapy.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The stimulated cells may be reintroduced to the host by a number of approaches.
      <br/>
      Preferably, they are injected intravenously.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the host may be treated with agents to promote the in vivo function and survival of the stimulated cells (e.g., IL-2).
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Of course, the stimulated cells may be reintroduced in a variety of pharmaceutical formulations.
      <br/>
      These may contain such normally employed additives as binders, fillers, carriers, preservatives, stabilizing agents, emulsifiers, and buffers.
      <br/>
      Suitable diluents and excipients are, for example, water, saline, and dextrose.
    </p>
    <heading>ALTERNATE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="61">
      Tumor resensitized lymphocytes may become anergized in the course of tumor growth in vivo and become refractory to activation or expansion by the superantigens with T cell V BETA  specificity.
      <br/>
      Various cytokines may partially reverse T memory cell anergy, namely, IL-2, IL-4, or IL-1 plus IL-6.
      <br/>
      These cytokines may promote T cell proliferation and may represent an essential "second signal" typically provided by antigen presenting cells.
      <br/>
      Hence, responsiveness of tumor sensitized lymphocytes may be restored by co-culturing with various cytokines and mitogens such as anti-CD3 antibody or conconavalin A.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      While the preferred embodiment involves culturing ex vivo, other approaches are also contemplated.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates transfecting with superantigen genes into tumor cells to provide powerful augmenting signals to T cell stimulation.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, dual transfection with superantigens and molecules such as B7 is contemplated.
      <br/>
      Moreover, various cytokines and antibodies which are known to enhance T cell proliferation and secretion such as interleukin 1, interleukin 2, interleukin 4, interleukin 6, anti-CD3 or anti-CD2 may be employed simultaneously or sequentially with enterotoxins in vivo or in vitro to augment antitumor effects of the enterotoxins.
    </p>
    <p num="63">Substances which increase the number of antigen-presenting cells, as well as substances which induce up- regulation of class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells or T cells, such as Y interferon, ICAM molecules and the like, used in vitro or in vivo could create additional binding sites for superantigen presentation to the T lymphocyte population and augment T lymphocyte proliferative and secretory function as well as anti-tumor effects.</p>
    <p num="64">
      Differences of antitumor reactivities between SEA and SEB stimulated cells probably represent distinct T cell subsets with V BETA  phenotypes responding to these two superantigens.
      <br/>
      If a population of T cells with specific V BETA  phenotype appears to mediate the antitumor effects, selective depletion of the ineffective subsets and expansion of the fraction of effective subset(s) can be carried out with immunomagnetic beads or monoclonal antibodies.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if a major tumor-killing V BETA  subtype T cell population is found to be deleted, that population may be reconstituted with T cells transfected with the specific V BETA  genes by various transfection techniques now in use in the field.
      <br/>
      Such a reconstituted T cell clone can be stimulated with appropriate tumor antigen in vitro or in vivo to create a presensitized T cell population and then with enterotoxin, plus antigen presenting cell APC stimulus.
      <br/>
      After expansion in IL-2, this reconstituted T cell clone would be expected to restore T cell function and antitumor activity to the deleted clone.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Finally, various superantigens may be employed sequentially to up-regulate the activity of one another.
      <br/>
      For example, SEA, which is known to be a powerful cytokine inducer, may be used in vitro or in vivo to up-regulate class II molecules before the use of SEB or SEC, which are potent T cell stimulants.
      <br/>
      The up-regulated class II binding sites created by SEA would be occupied by SEB, providing significantly increased antigenic presentation to the T cell V BETA  repertoire.

      In a canine model using the Protein A collodion charcoal (PACC) system described in a series of patent applications (for example, U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 331,095, the forerunner of the present invention), therapeutic success was transferred to humans in protocols in which objective tumor regressions were obtained in four of the first five consecutive patients treated.
      <br/>
      Thus, the data given herein also is expected to be predictive of success when the compositions are applied to humans.

    <p num="67">Enterotoxin Genes: Genetically Engineered Tumor Cells, Accessory Cells, and Peptides</p>
    <p num="68">
      The genes for the enterotoxins and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins have been cloned.
      <br/>
      With their known mimicry of the Mls locus and their affinity for T cell V BETA  receptors, it would be logical to assume that transfection of the enterotoxin gene into tumor cells bearing appropriate HLA-DQ or DR or DP would result in production of a tumor cell bearing the minor lymphocyte stimulating locus capable of ligating MHC class II molecules with T lymphocytes, therefore stimulating potent T cell proliferation and associated antitumor immunity.
      <br/>
      Experiments are being designed and implemented to test this hypothesis.
      <br/>
      The rabbit VX-2 carcinoma cells have been established in tissue culture.
      <br/>
      The gene for enterotoxins A and B have been isolated and have been made available for these studies by Dr.
      <br/>
      Marcia Betley and Dr.
      <br/>
      Saleem Khann, respectively.
      <br/>
      Plans for transfection of rabbit VX-2 carcinoma cells with both genes have been made with Dr.
      <br/>
      Susan Faas and Dr.
      <br/>
      John McIntyre of Tektagen, Malverne, Pa.
      <br/>
      The transfected cells will then be injected into rabbits bearing the VX-2 carcinoma with appropriate controls consisting of non-transfected rabbit VX-2 carcinoma cells and VX-2 cells transfected with an irrelevant microbial genes.
      <br/>
      Anti-tumor effects will be assessed in this system.
    </p>
    <p num="69">Alternatively, the toxin gene transfected tumor cells could be used for in vitro stimulation of host immunocytes prior to or coordinate with the addition of interleukin 2 to produce an enriched population of tumor specific T cells which could then be reinfused into a tumor bearing host and would be expected to exert tumor killing effects.</p>
    <p num="70">
      The enterotoxin gene could be used to transfect various accessory cells resulting in enterotoxin expression on the cell surface which may then induce more potent stimulation and proliferation of tumoricidal T lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      The cotransfection of these accessory cells with adhesion molecules and MHC molecules might further augment the mitogenic activity of T lymphocytes induced by these accessory cells.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Mutant genes of the toxins could be used to transfect various bacteria such as E. coli resulting in the production of toxin peptides retaining antitumor activity.
      <br/>
      Such superantigen peptides might have sequences homologous with various naturally occurring viruses such as mammary tumor virus, endogenous proteins such as heat shock proteins, stress proteins and minor lymphocyte stimulating loci, naturally occurring bacteria such as mycoplasma and mycobacterial species.
      <br/>
      Amino acid sequences in the native toxin molecules associated with toxicity such as emesis, excessive cytokine induction or humoral antibody production would be deleted.
      <br/>
      For example, histadine residues of SEB may account for emetic responses of the SEB molecule since carboxymethylation of the SEB molecule selectively blocks histadine moieties resulting in a reduction of the emetic response.
      <br/>
      Additional mutant genes might be employed to produce peptides which bind selectively to T lymphocytes or class II molecules without stimulating mitogenesis, cytokine or antibody production.
      <br/>
      As such, these genetically engineered molecules might be used to block or eliminate autoimmune responses induced by proliferation of clones of immunocytes reactive to self constituents such as basic myelin protein in multiple sclerosis or synovial constituents in rheumatoid arthritis.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Moreover, enterotoxin genes would be fused with genes from other bioreactive compounds such as cell poisons to produce molecules with capacity to destroy a selective cell population.
      <br/>
      Such fusion peptides might include enterotoxin sequences fused, for example, with peptides of pseudomonas toxin, diphtheria toxin sequences or antibodies yielding complexes retaining the major structural, biologic features of the native proteins.

      Approach 1: A 10 ml culture of Staphylococcus aureus 11N-165 (SEA), Staphylococcus aureus 361 (Source: Dr. John landolo, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kans.) (SEC2) is grown overnight at 37 (degree)  C. The removal of enterotoxin from the supernatant is carried out using QAE-Sephadex.
      <br/>
      The toxin is then eluted batchwise from the ion exchanger and recovered by filtration on a sintered glass funnel.
      <br/>
      The eluates are concentrated by ultrafiltration.
      <br/>
      The toxin is then passed through a Sephadex-G-100 column.
      <br/>
      Two peaks absorbing at 280 mm are eluted, with the latter containing the enterotoxin.
      <br/>
      The eluted toxin is concentrated and rerun on Sephadex-G-100.
      <br/>
      The overall recovery is about 30% for SEC2 and 40 to 50% for SEA.
      <br/>
      Both toxins appear homogeneous by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      Approach 2: Staphlococcus aureus Strain FRI-722 is grown in a 3% enzyme-hydrolyzed casein and 7% yeast extract at pH 6.6 at a temperature of 35-37 (degree)  C. The mixture is gently agitated for 16-20 hours.
      <br/>
      The culture is filtered through a 0.2 micron filter and the filtrate pH is adjusted to 5.6. The filtrate is diluted 1:5 to 1:10 with deionized water, incubated with a cation exchange resin and stirred for 1 h. The resin is collected and the bound protein is eluted with high ionic strength buffer.
      <br/>
      The eluate is concentrated and dialyzed then reincubated with a second cation exchange resin.
      <br/>
      The SEA is eluted with a low ionic strength to high ionic strength buffer gradient.
      <br/>
      The fraction containing SEA is concentrated, dialyzed and loaded onto a gel filtration system.
      <br/>
      The fraction containing SEA is concentrated and dialyzed against PBS pH 7.2. The final solution is filter-sterilized and frozen.
      <br/>
      Total protein is determined spectrophotometrically at 280/260 nm.

      For C1 and D, the supernatants are passed over an AmberLite-CG-50 column, as described for SED, and the active fractions pooled.
      <br/>
      All three toxins are then placed in buffer for chromatofocusing and then separated using the MONO P column FPLC system.
      <br/>
      Since all of the toxins have isoelectric points in the range of 7 to 9, the polybuffer PBE-96 is used for elution.
      <br/>
      The purity of SEA, SEC1 and SED is estimated to be 98, 95 and 80%, respectively.
      <br/>
      SEA elutes as two peaks at pH 8.8 and 8.6. SEC1 also elutes as two peaks at pH 8.3 and 7.9, and SED elutes as three peaks at pH 8.6, 8.3 and 8 0 (slashed zero)

      <br/>
      These cells may be isolated from a variety of sources.
      <br/>
      In this example, they are obtained from the lymph nodes.

    <p num="110">Isolation Of Host Cells: Spleen Cells</p>
    <p num="111">
      In this example, the host cells are obtained from the human spleen.
      <br/>
      Either a left subcostal incision or midline incision may be used for resection.
      <br/>
      The spleen is mobilized initially by dividing the ligamentous attachments, which are usually avascular.
      <br/>
      The short gastric vessels then are doubly ligated and transected.
      <br/>
      This permits ultimate dissection of the splenic hilus with individual ligation and division of the splenic artery and vein.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      The sequence of technical maneuvers necessary to remove the spleen varies somewhat, depending on the surgeon's election to approach the splenic hilum either anteriorly or posteriorly.
      <br/>
      The anterior approach is somewhat slower.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      Anterior Method.
      <br/>
      On entering the abdomen, the stomach should be thoroughly emptied by suction through a nasogastric tube already in place, if this maneuver has not been accomplished preoperatively.
      <br/>
      An opening is made in the gastrosplenic omentum in an avascular area, and by retracting the stomach upward and anteriorly through this opening the upper part of the pancreas can be visualized.
      <br/>
      The tortuous splenic artery can be seen along its upper margin; it is, at the option of the surgeon, ligated.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      The next step in the procedure is division of the lower two-thirds of the gastrosplenic omentum.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by dividing the vascular omentum between clamps and ligating the cut ends subsequently.
      <br/>
      The gastrosplenic omentum is frequently infiltrated with a considerable amount of adipose tissue and tends to slip away from clamps, especially if traction is applied to the instruments.
      <br/>
      The upper portion of this omentum also contains the vasa brevia and large venous tributaries joining the left gastroepiploic vein.
      <br/>
      To avoid hemorrhage from these sources, suture ligation rather than simple ligatures should be utilized in this area.
      <br/>
      Access to the upper portion of the gastrosplenic omentum is difficult with the spleen in situ, and for this reason it is best divided with the later stage after mobilization of the splenic hilum.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      Following division of the splenic vasculature, the splenorenal, the splenocolic, and the splenophrenic ligaments are divided.
      <br/>
      All except the last mentioned are generally avascular and pose no particular technical problems in division.
      <br/>
      The remnants of the splenophrenic ligament left behind may have to be underrun with running chromic catgut suture for hemostasis.
      <br/>
      The spleen is displaced from the abdomen and delivered through the incision.
      <br/>
      The only remaining attachments still in place is the upper third of the gastrosplenic ligament which is now carefully divided between ligatures, completing the splenectomy procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      Posterior Method.
      <br/>
      The posterior approach of removing the spleen is much more expeditious than the anterior approach, but blood loss is usually more substantial than in the anterior approach.
      <br/>
      After entering the abdomen the surgeon makes an incision in the avascular splenorenal ligament and then inserts three fingers behind the hilum of the spleen which is easily mobilized by blind dissection.
      <br/>
      Hemorrhage from the splenic hilum during this process can be avoided by placing the incision on the splenorenal ligament closer to the kidney and away from the spleen.
      <br/>
      By rapidly dividing the splenophrenic and the splenocolic ligaments, it is now possible to deliver the spleen through the incision.
      <br/>
      Any hemorrhage from the splenic hilum or from the ruptured spleen itself is very easily controlled at this point by manual compression of the splenic hilum or placement of a noncrushing clamp, taking care not to injure the tail of the pancreas.
      <br/>
      The gastrosplenic ligament and the presplenic fold when present can now be divided and suture ligated in a deliberate manner.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      Cell Suspensions.
      <br/>
      Spleen cells are mechanically dissociated by using the blunt end of a 10-ml plastic syringe in buffer.

      The cell suspension was passed through a single layer of 100-gauge nylon mesh (Nitex; Lawshe Industrial Co., Bethesda, Md.) and centrifuged, and the RBC lysed by resuspension of the cell pellet in ammonium chloride/potassium lysing buffer, (8.29 g of NH4 Cl, 1.0 g KHCO3 and 0.0372 g of EDTA/L pH 7.4; Media Production Section, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.).

    <p num="137">
      Previous studies have shown that enterotoxins are present in commercial preparations of protein A produced by either enzymatic digestion of whole bacteria or by secretion into culture media.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the IgG used in affinity chromatography to isolate protein A has now been shown to contain the complete library of antibodies to virtually all enterotoxins.
      <br/>
      Following perfusion with plasma, plasma products or whole blood over enterotoxins immobilized on biocompatible support matrices, enterotoxins are released whether they were immobilized via covalent or non-covalent binding.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      Enterotoxins or superantigens may be immobilized by non-covalent or covalent methods such as adsorption or carboduimide on inert supports such as collodion charcoal or silica, as previously described (U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,091, issued Feb. 25, 1992 to Terman).
      <br/>
      After plasma or blood product perfusion, the bound enterotoxins are released in a graded fashion over a 15 minute to 3 hour period.

      Toxicity associated with this procedure has been described in detail previously (Terman, 1984) and is manageable with corticosteroids and occasionally with low dose dopamine infusions.

      In this example, enterotoxins are provided for intravenous adminstration by displacement chromatography from immobilized surfaces after plasma or plasma component perfusion.

      Enterotoxins are immobilized on solid surfaces by carbodiimide chemistry or adsorbed by adsorptic chemistry on solid supports.
      <br/>
      Surfaces include silica, glass, cellulose, agarose, polystyrene and methacrylate.
      <br/>
      Perfused fluids can be selected from a group containing albumin, immunoglobulins or other plasma proteins.
