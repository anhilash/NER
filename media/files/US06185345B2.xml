    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to method and apparatus for providing ultra-stable optical wavelength division multiplexing and/or demultiplexing.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The implementation of a low cost, low insertion loss, dense wavelength division multiplexer (DWDM) or demultiplexer (DWDD) is of great advantage in high capacity optical systems.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, most DWDM of DWDD devices have high insertion loss or high cost associated with them.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,809,190 (Chen), issued on Sept. 15, 1998, discloses an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder (UMZ) interferometer capable of accomplishing dense wavelength division (DWD) multiplexing with low insertion loss.
      <br/>
      More particularly, Chen discloses apparatus and method of making a fused dense wavelength division multiplexer (DWDM) using a fused-biconical taper technique.
      <br/>
      The DWDM comprises multiple Multi-window Wavelength Division Multiplexers (MWDMs) which are cascaded in several stages where the MWDMs in each stage have an identical window spacing.
      <br/>
      For an N-channel DWDM, there are a predetermined plurality of DWDMs in each stage, and the stages are cascaded to form the MWDM.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the UMZ is by nature sensitive to temperature fluctuations of the environment, and typical temperature fluctuations expected in the terminal environment can render the DWDM device unusable.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the disclosed UMZ device is unstable because of the occurrence of variations in phase due to temperature fluctuations.
      <br/>
      A similar device is also discussed in an article titled "Fused-Coupler Technology for DWDM Applications" by F. Gonthier in the magazine Fiber Optic Product News, September 1998, at pages 54 and 56.

      <br/>
      Both output legs containing separate matched Bragg grating reflectors at separate predetermined distances from a central optical coupling region of the filter to reduce any noise component in a channel signal by a predetermined amount.

      The optical filter is able to redirect the channel signal into either a launch leg or a band-pass leg of the filter.

      Viewed from one aspect, the present invention is directed to an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer for use in, for example, an optical wavelength division multiplexer or demultiplexer.
      <br/>
      The unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer comprises first and second fused tapered couplers, and a variable delay providing means.
      <br/>
      Each of the first and second fused tapered couplers are responsive to the reception of at least one first and second optical input signals for generating separate predetermined first and second optical output signals.
      <br/>
      The first and second output signals from the first fused tapered coupler are coupled via first and second optical waveguides, respectively, to respective first and second optical inputs of the second fused tapered coupler.
      <br/>
      First and second output signals from the second fused tapered coupler are provided as first and second output signals from the unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer.
      <br/>
      The variable delay providing means is coupled in one of the first and second waveguides coupling the first and second optical output signals from the first fused tapered coupler to the first and second optical inputs of the second fused tapered coupler.
      <br/>
      The variable delay providing means introduces a predetermined variable delay into an optical signal passing therethrough for maintaining a relative delay between the first and second waveguides at a constant value.

    <p num="8">
      Viewed from another aspect, the present invention is directed to an optical wavelength division multiplexer or demultiplexer comprising a plurality of unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers located in a plurality of stages of a cascading arrangement.
      <br/>
      Each unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer comprises a first fused tapered coupler, a second fused tapered coupler, and a variable delay providing means.
      <br/>
      The first fused tapered coupler is responsive to the reception of at least one of first and second optical input signals for generating separate predetermined first and second optical output signals for transmission via first and second optical waveguides, respectively.
      <br/>
      The second fused tapered coupler is responsive to the reception of the first and second optical output signals from the first fused tapered coupler which are received at first and second optical inputs, respectively, from the respective first and second optical waveguides, for generating separate predetermined first and second optical output signals from the unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer.
      <br/>
      The variable delay providing means is coupled in one of the first and second waveguides coupling the output signals from the first fused tapered coupler to the first and second optical inputs of the second fused tapered coupler for introducing a predetermined variable delay into the associated optical output signal from the first fused tapered coupler passing therethrough for maintaining a relative delay between the first and second waveguides at a constant value.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Viewed from still another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of providing a unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer that compensates for signal drift.

      <br/>
      In a second step, the first and second optical output signals generated by the first fused tapered coupler in step (a) are received at first and second optical inputs, respectively, of a second fused tapered coupler from the respective first and second optical waveguides.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      Referring now to FIG. 1 there is shown a prior art unbalanced Mach-Zehnder multi-wavelength interferometer or filter 10 (shown within a dashed line rectangle) comprising first and second fused taper 3 dB couplers (CPLR.) 12 and 14.
      <br/>
      Each of the two fused taper couplers 12 and 14 is formed by, for example, heating two optical fibers (e.g., optical fibers 16 and 17) and fusing a section thereof together while tapering the fused section to a central point before dividing again.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the fused tapered couplers 12 and 14 can be formed from planar waveguides to obtain a similar structure.
      <br/>
      The first fused taper coupler 12 is coupled to receive first and second optical input signals (INPUT 1 and 2) via optical fibers 16 and 17, respectively.
      <br/>
      After passing through the first fused taper coupler 12, the resultant combined first and second output signals are transmitted via first and second optical fibers 18 and 19, respectively, for providing respective first and second input signals at separate inputs of the second fused taper coupler 14.
      <br/>
      The optical path lengths of the optical fibers 18 and 19 are have a predetermined difference and their lengths are hereinafter referred to as L18 and L19, respectively.
      <br/>
      After passing through the second fused taper coupler 14, the resultant combined signals are transmitted as first and second output signals (OUT 1 and 2) from the Mach-Zehnder interferometer 10 via first and second output optical fibers 20 and 21, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Based on the principles of interferometry, the transmission profiles "T" of the filter 10 in the first and second output optical fibers 20 and 21 are given by the equations:
      <br/>
      T20 =cos2 ( PHI ), and T21 =sin2 ( PHI ),  (Eq. 1)
      <br/>
      PHI =2 PI n DELTA L/w,  (Eq. 2)
    </p>
    <p num="14">where n is the refractive index of the interferometer medium,  DELTA L is the relative path length difference ( DELTA L=L19 -L18), and w is the wavelength of light.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring now to FIG. 2, there is graphically shown exemplary output waveforms obtained in the optical fibers 20 and 21 from the Mach-Zehnder multi-wavelength filter (interferometer) 10 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The horizontal axis represents wavelength in nanometers (nm), and the vertical axis represents transmission in decibels (dB).
      <br/>
      The solid waveform represents the exemplary waveform obtained in the output optical fiber 20, and the dashed line waveform represents the exemplary waveform obtained in the output optical fiber 21.
      <br/>
      The waveforms for the optical fibers 20 and 21 are complementary to each other as is shown in Equation (1), and the peaks are separated by  DELTA w, where w is the wavelength of light and  DELTA w is given by the equation
      <br/>
      DELTA w=w2 /(2n DELTA L).  (Eq. 3)
    </p>
    <p num="16">The filtering property of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer 10 can be exploited to separate densely packed signals at different wavelengths by cascading Mach-Zehnder interferometers with different  DELTA w's.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Referring now to FIG. 3, there is shown an exemplary Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexer (DWDM) or Demultiplexer 30 (shown within a dashed line rectangle) found in the prior art comprising a cascading of unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers 10a-10g.
      <br/>
      A first stage of the cascaded arrangement comprises the Mach-Zehnder interferometer 10a which is capable of receiving first and second input signals and generate first and second output signals via optical waveguides 31 and 32, respectively.
      <br/>
      A second stage of the cascaded arrangement comprises the Mach-Zehnder interferometers 10b and 10c.
      <br/>
      The interferometer 10b is coupled to receive the first output from the interferometer 10a via the optical waveguide 31 at one of its two inputs with the other input being pigtailed (unused).
      <br/>
      The interferometer 10c is coupled to receive the second output from the interferometer 10a via the optical waveguide 32 at one of its two inputs with the other input being pigtailed (unused).
      <br/>
      A first output of the interferometer 10b is coupled to one of two inputs of the interferometer 10d via an optical waveguide 34 while a second output therefrom is coupled to one of two inputs of the interferometer 10e via an optical waveguide 35.
      <br/>
      The other input of the interferometers 10d and 10e are pigtailed (unused).
      <br/>
      Similarly, a first output of the interferometer 10c is coupled to one of two inputs of the interferometer 10f via an optical waveguide 34 while a second output therefrom is coupled to one of two inputs of the interferometer 10g via an optical waveguide 35.
      <br/>
      The other input of the interferometers 10f and 10g are pigtailed (unused).
      <br/>
      First and second outputs from each of the interferometers 10d, 10e, 10f, and 10g provide separate output channel signals from the DWD Demultiplexer arrangement 30.
      <br/>
      For multiplexing eight channel signals, the DWDM arrangement 30 would be used in a reverse direction with the eight channels signal being inputted at the right side (at OUT 1 to OUT 8) of FIG. 3 and a single wavelength division multiplexed signal being generated at one of the two outputs (at INPUT 1 or 2).
    </p>
    <p num="18">In the cascading arrangement of the unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers 10a-10g, the  DELTA w (delta wavelength) of each Mach-Zehnder interferometer in a stage is adjusted to be twice that of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer(s) in a previous stage.</p>
    <p num="19">
      Referring now to FIG. 4, there is graphically shown enlarged exemplary output waveforms for one section of a frequency spectrum used with the prior art cascaded unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers 10a-10g shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the waveforms shown in FIG. 4 are essentially for one channel area and are repetitious in a corresponding manner below 1548 nm and above 1551 nm for the other channel areas.
      <br/>
      The horizontal axis represents wavelength in nanometers (nm) between 1548 and 1551 nanometers, and the vertical axis represents transmission in decibels (dB) between 0.001 and 1 decibels.
      <br/>
      From the graphical display in FIG. 4, it can be seen that cascading three levels of unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers 10a-10g (as is shown in FIG. 3) can allow for the separation of eight channels when demultiplexing an input DWD multiplexed signal.
      <br/>
      The dotted line waveform 42 is representative of an output on either leg 31 or 32 of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer 10a in the first stage of the DWD demultiplexer 30, where, for example, wavelengths 1,3,5,7 are found propagating in output leg 31 and wavelengths 2,4,6,8 are found propagating in output leg 32.
      <br/>
      The dashed line waveform 44 is representative of an output on any one of the output legs 34 or 35 from the Mach-Zehnder interferometers 10b and 10c in the second stage of the cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers 10a-10g.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the wavelengths 1 and 5 are found propagating in output leg 34 of interferometer 10b, wavelengths 3 and 7 are found propagating in output leg 35 of interferometer 10b, the wavelengths 2 and 6 are found propagating in output leg 34 of interferometer 10c, wavelengths 4 and 6 are found propagating in output leg 35 of interferometer 10c.
      <br/>
      The solid line waveform 46 is representative of an output on any one of the output legs 37 or 38 from the Mach-Zehnder interferometers 10d, 10e, 10f, or 10c in the third stage of the cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers 10a-10g.
      <br/>
      The bold solid line waveform 48 is representative of an output on either leg 37 or 38 from the Mach-Zehnder interferometers 10d, 10e, 10f, or 10c in the third stage of the cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers 10a-10g.
      <br/>
      As was stated hereinabove, the waveforms shown in FIG. 4 are repetitious in a corresponding manner below 1548 nm and above 1551 nm so that the peak of the bold line waveform 48 corresponds to only one of the outputs from one of the Mach-Zehnder interferometers 10d, 10e, 10f, or 10g.
      <br/>
      Each of the remaining outputs from the Mach-Zehnder interferometers 10d, 10e, 10f, or 10g has a peak at a different wavelength such that a separate demultiplexed channel of a received eight-channel multiplexed signal is obtained at each output (OUT 1-OUT 8) from the cascaded unbalanced Mach-Zehnders 10a-10g in the DWDM 30.
      <br/>
      If, for example, it is assumed that wavelengths of channels 1, 3, 5, and 7 are found propagating in output leg 31 of interferometer 10a, and wavelengths of channels 2, 4, 6, and 8 are found propagating in output leg 32 of interferometer 10a, then the first and second outputs via optical waveguides 37 and 38 from interferometer 10d are the demultiplexed channel 1 and 3 signals, respectively.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the first and second outputs via optical waveguides 37 and 38 from interferometer 10e are the demultiplexed channel 5 and 7 signals, respectively, the first and second outputs via optical waveguides 37 and 38 from interferometer 10f are the demultiplexed channel 2 and 4 signals, respectively, and the first and second outputs via optical waveguides 37 and 38 from interferometer 10g are the demultiplexed channel 6 and 8 signals, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The cascade unbalanced Mach-Zehnder arrangement as is shown in FIG. 3 is suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 5,809,190 (Chen), issued on Sep. 15, 1998. There is one significant short-coming of such an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder based device.
      <br/>
      It becomes obvious from Equation 1 that the performance of such a device is based entirely on the relative optical path difference in an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if there were any conditions in the environment that would change the optical path difference in the unbalanced Mach-Zehnder, the performance of the device would also be effected.
      <br/>
      Such effects can be studied by examining the argument of the sine or cosine functions in Equation 1 as a function of an external variable  BETA .
      <br/>
      Assuming that the external variable  BETA  effects both the refractive index and the length of the waveguide 18 or 19, the change in the phase  DELTA  PHI  can be written as,
      <br/>
      DELTA  PHI =(2 PI /w) DELTA (n DELTA L)=(2 PI /w)�n * d DELTA L/  DELTA  BETA + DELTA L * dn/d BETA (dn/d BETA � DELTA  BETA .  (Eq. 4)
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      If  BETA  represents temperature change, then (1/ DELTA L)d DELTA L/d BETA  represents a coefficient of thermal expansion, and (1/n)dn/d BETA  represents a thermo-optic coefficient.
      <br/>
      The effects of temperature change in a DWDM can be studied by modeling the output of a single channel in both the presence and absence of external temperature changes.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Referring now to FIG. 5, there is shown the results of a numerical modeling of unbalanced Mach-Zehnders 10a-10g cascaded as is shown in FIG. 3 to illustrate an extraction of a single channel shown by the solid line waveform from an output leg of an eight channel device (seven cascaded unbalanced Mach-Zehnders 10a-10g).
      <br/>
      The horizontal axis represents wavelength in nanometers (nm) between 1548 and 1551 nanometers, and the vertical axis represents transmission in decibels (dB) between 0.001 and 1 decibels.
      <br/>
      If the temperature of, for example, the first unbalanced Mach-Zehnder 10a is changed by 50 degrees Centigrade (a typical temperature range obtainable in a telecommunication application), the performance of the overall DWD demultiplexer 30 of FIG. 3 suffers significantly, and the relative loss of the channel being extracted increases by 10 dB (as is indicated by a dashed line in FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      Such an extreme change in the loss of the channel renders the DWD demultiplexer 30 useless in most applications of channel separation.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, due to the complementary nature of the unbalanced Mach-Zehnder filters, the signal loss is not dissipated, but redirected to a different channel leading to deleterious cross talk and signal degradation in other channels.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Referring now to FIG. 6, there is shown a block diagram of an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer 60 (shown within a dashed line rectangle) in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the arrangement of the unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer 60 would be used, for example, for each of the unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer 10a-10g in the cascaded DWD multiplexer/demultiplexer 30 of FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer 60 comprises first and second fused tapered 3 dB couplers (FUSED TAPER. 3 dB CPLR.) 62 and 64, a variable delay line (VAR. DELAY LINE) 66 coupled with an environmental control (ENVIRN. CONTROL) 68.
      <br/>
      The first fused tapered coupler 62 is coupled to receive first and/or second optical input signals via optical waveguides 70 and 71, respectively.
      <br/>
      First and second optical output signals generated in the first fused tapered coupler 62 are coupled to (a) a first optical input of the second fused tapered coupler 64 via optical waveguide 73, and (b) an optical input of the variable delay line 66 via optical waveguide 74, respectively.
      <br/>
      An optical output signal from the variable delay line 66 is coupled to a second optical input of the second fused tapered coupler 64.
      <br/>
      The second fused tapered coupler 64 generates first and second optical output signals (OUT 1 and OUT 2) from the unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer 60.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer 60 provides a general technique for overcoming signal drift problems by introducing the variable delay line 66 in one of the intermediate paths 73 or 74 of the interferometer 60.
      <br/>
      The delay provided in the variable delay line 66 can be controlled by sensing the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature) in the environmental control 68.
      <br/>
      The environmental control 68 then transmits appropriate control signals to the variable delay line 66 to maintain the relative delay between the paths 73 and 74 at a constant value.
      <br/>
      This avoids the condition graphically illustrated in FIG. 5.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Referring now to FIG. 7, there is shown a block diagram of an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer 80 (shown within a dashed line rectangle) in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 7, bold solid lines represent optical paths while thinner solid lines represent electrical paths.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the arrangement of the unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer 80 would be used, for example, for each of the unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer 10a-10g in the cascaded DWD multiplexer/demultiplexer 30 of FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer 80 comprises first and second fused tapered 3 dB couplers (FUSED TAPER. 3 dB CPLR.) 82 and 84, a variable delay line (VAR. DELAY LINE) 86, first and second optical taps 88 and 89, first and second bandpass filters (BPF) 90 and 92, first and second photodetectors (PHOTODETECT) 94 and 96, and a control 98.
      <br/>
      The first fused tapered coupler 82 is coupled to receive first and/or second optical input signals via optical waveguides 100 and 101, respectively.
      <br/>
      First and second optical output signals generated in the first fused tapered coupler 82 are coupled to (a) a first optical input of the second fused tapered coupler 84 via optical waveguide 103, and (b) an optical input of the variable delay line 86 via optical waveguide 104, respectively.
      <br/>
      An optical output signal from the variable delay line 86 is coupled to a second optical input of the second fused tapered coupler 84.
      <br/>
      The second fused tapered coupler 84 generates first and second optical output signals (OUT 1 and OUT 2) from the unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer 80 via optical waveguides 106 and 108, respectively.
      <br/>
      The first and second optical taps 88 and 89 are coupled to divert a portion of the first and second optical output signals from the second fused tapered coupler 84 propagating in optical waveguides 106 and 108, respectively, to optical inputs of the respective first and second optical bandpass filters 90 and 92 via optical waveguides 105 and 107, respectively.
      <br/>
      Optical output signals from the first and second optical bandpass filters 90 and 92 are coupled to optical inputs of the first and second photodetectors 94 and 96, respectively.
      <br/>
      Electrical output control signals from the first and second photodetectors 94 and 96 are coupled to separate inputs of the control 98, and an electrical output from the control 98 is coupled to an second input of the variable delay line 86.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In operation, an optical input signal is received at one of the optical inputs (INPUT 1 or INPUT 2) of the first fused tapered coupler 82.
      <br/>
      The resultant optical output signals from the first fused tapered coupler 82 propagate in optical waveguides 103 and 104 to the first and second optical inputs of the second fused tapered coupler 84, with the variable delay line 86 interjecting a predetermined delay into the optical signal propagating in the optical waveguide 104.
      <br/>
      A portion of the resultant first and second optical output signals from the second fused tapered coupler 84 in optical waveguides 106 and 108 are diverted by the first and second optical taps 88 and 89, respectively, to the respective first and second optical bandpass filters 90 and 92.
      <br/>
      The first and second bandpass filters 90 and 92 have their response centered about two quadrature points which are out of phase by  PI  radians.
      <br/>
      The resultant optical output signals from the first and second bandpass filters 90 and 92 are converted into corresponding electrical control signals by the first and second photodetectors 94 and 96, respectively.
      <br/>
      The electrical control signals from the first and second photodetectors 94 and 96 are used by the control 98 to generate appropriate electrical control signals to the variable delay line 86 for maintaining the relative delay between the paths 103 and 104 at a constant value.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The variable delay in either one of the unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers 60 or 80 of FIGS. 5 and 6, respectively, can be generated by any suitable method.
      <br/>
      For example, if the unbalanced Mach-Zehnder (UMZ) interferometer 60 or 80 is made using optical fibers instead of using planar waveguides, one or both optical fibers can be coated with Piezo-Electric material which can be used to apply strain on the fiber(s) and thereby causing a relative phase shift to cancel phase drifts due to environmental temperature drifts.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the optical fiber can be coated with a high resistance metal/material which can be forced to change its temperature due to an electric current through it from the control 68 or 98.
      <br/>
      Temperature changes in the waveguide can be used to maintain a fixed phase relationship in a planar waveguide version of the UMZ 60 or 80 by installing micro heaters around segments of the waveguide regions in the interferometers 60 or 80.
      <br/>
      Still further, it is possible to mount the UMZ 60 or 80 on a negative expansion material so that, as the temperature of the environment increases, a refractive index increase in the interferometer 60 or 80 is offset by a refractive index decrease in the interferometer 60 or 80 by strain relaxation.
