      A barrier layer is included in an integrated circuit capacitor, between a conductive plug and a lower capacitor electrode.
      <br/>
      The barrier layer includes refractory metal and grain boundary filling material.
      <br/>
      The grain boundary filling material preferably is Ce, Zr, Y, Th, Hf, La, Al and/or oxides thereof, and is preferably less that 20 atomic percent of the barrier layer.
      <br/>
      The barrier layer can reduce and preferably prevent diffusion of oxygen, and can thereby reduce the leakage current and oxidation of the integrated circuit capacitor.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to integrated circuit devices and fabrication methods thereof, and more particularly to integrated circuit capacitors and fabrication methods thereof.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Capacitors are widely used in integrated circuit devices, such as Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) devices.
      <br/>
      As DRAM devices become more highly integrated, various approaches for increasing the capacitance within a defined cell area have been proposed.
      <br/>
      For example, one approach is to thin the dielectric film.
      <br/>
      A second approach is to make the capacitor three-dimensional to increase the effective area thereof.
      <br/>
      A third approach is to use a material having a high dielectric constant.
      <br/>
      These approaches can also be combined.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Unfortunately, in the first approach, when the thickness of the dielectric film is 100  Angstrom  or less, the reliability may deteriorate due to Fowler-Nordheim currents.
      <br/>
      This may limit the ability to fabricate ultra-thin dielectric films.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the second approach, complicated processes and high product cost may result when fabricating a three-dimensional capacitor, such as a cylindrical type or a pin type capacitor.
      <br/>
      This may limit the advantages of three-dimensional capacitors.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      For the third approach, various proposals for increasing capacitance using a high dielectric contact material have been made.
      <br/>
      For the high dielectric constant material, ferroelectric materials such as SrTiO3 Ba(Sr, Ti)O3 (BST), Pb(Zr, Ti)O3 (PZT), Pb(La, Zr)TiO3 and Ta2 O5 may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A metal of the platinum group or an oxide thereof has been used for an electrode material of the high dielectric capacitor.
      <br/>
      It will be understood that the platinum group metals include the following six metals, all of which are members of Group VIII of the periodic system: ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium and platinum.
      <br/>
      The platinum group metals have an excellent oxidation resistance, so they are not oxidized even where they contact the high dielectric layer.
      <br/>
      Further, platinum has an excellent leakage current characteristic.
      <br/>
      That is, platinum (Pt) has a work function higher than that of high dielectric material such as BST, SrTiO3 and PZT, so that a Schottky barrier is formed at an interface with the high dielectric material, which can provide excellent leakage current characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      However, platinum may react with polysilicon at a temperature of 300 (degree)  C. or higher, to thereby form silicide.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is known to form a barrier layer for preventing silicide formation, at a lower portion of a platinum electrode.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, materials commonly used for the barrier layer, for example metal nitrides such as TiN, TaN or WN1-x, may be oxidized during a subsequent heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In particular, the platinum electrode formation generally is performed at a high temperature so that the surface of the electrode is smooth.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, a high dielectric constant layer is deposited in an oxygen atmosphere at a high temperature.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, oxygen may flow into the barrier layer along a grain boundary of the platinum electrode, and then it may additionally diffuse during the subsequent heat treatment.
      <br/>
      As a result, nitrogen contained in the barrier layer may be replaced with oxygen, which may cause the barrier layer to peel off.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In order to overcome the above problem, it has been proposed to use a conductive oxide layer such as RuO2 or IrO2 for the capacitor electrode.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, a high dielectric constant capacitor having this structure is shown.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Referring to FIG. 1, reference numerals 10, 11 and 12 indicate an integrated circuit substrate such as a semiconductor substrate, an insulating layer and a conductive plug, respectively.

      In FIG. 1, the conductive plug 12 is formed of polysilicon, and the barrier layer 14 is formed of a metal nitride such as TiN.

      Also, the lower electrode 15 is formed of a conductive oxide layer, for example, RuO2.
      <br/>
      The high dielectric constant layer 17 can be formed of a high dielectric constant material such as BST, PZT, PLZT or Ta2 O5, and the upper electrode 19 can be formed of a metal of the platinum group or an oxide thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Unfortunately, although the conductive oxide layer forming the lower electrode 15 can prevent oxygen diffusion more effectively than platinum, it has a work function similar to that of the high dielectric constant layer, which can cause inferior leakage current characteristics.
      <br/>
      In order to improve the leakage current characteristics, the contact area between the lower electrode 15 and the high dielectric constant layer 17 can be reduced, for example, by reducing the thickness of the lower electrode 15.
      <br/>
      However, there may be a limit as to how thin the lower electrode 15 can be made.
      <br/>
      This is because the lower electrode 15 also functions as an oxygen diffusion barrier layer.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Accordingly, it has also been proposed to thin the lower electrode by forming a sacrificial layer comprising a platinum group metal, between the lower electrode layer and the barrier layer.

      The sacrificial layer can prevent oxidation as will now be described in connection with FIG. 2.

      The sacrificial layer 209 for preventing oxidization can be formed of a platinum group metal, for example, Ru.
      <br/>
      Ru reacts with oxygen which flows into the Ru layer during a subsequent processing performed under an oxygen atmosphere at a high temperature, thereby forming RuO2.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the sacrificial layer 209 for preventing oxidization blocks oxygen from flowing into the barrier layer 207, which can prevent oxidation of the barrier layer 207.

    <p num="17">
      However, in the above-described high dielectric constant capacitor, the leakage current characteristics may still be inferior.

      Specifically, it is difficult to prevent oxygen from flowing from the sidewall of the barrier layer 207.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, oxidization of the barrier layer 207 may not be sufficiently prevented.

    <p num="33">
      The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown.
      <br/>
      This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      In the drawings, the thickness of layers and regions are exaggerated for clarity.
      <br/>
      Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.
      <br/>
      It will also be understood that when a layer is referred to as being "on" another layer or substrate, it can be directly on the other layer or substrate, or intervening layers may also be present.
      <br/>
      Moreover, each embodiment described and illustrated herein includes its complementary conductivity type embodiment as well.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Referring to FIG. 3, an insulating layer 301 is formed on an integrated circuit substrate such as semiconductor substrate 300, and a conductive plug 303 and an ohmic layer 305 are formed in a predetermined region of the insulating layer 301A stacked structure is formed on the insulating layer 301 and the ohmic layer 305.
      <br/>
      The stacked structure includes a barrier layer pattern 307a, a first lower electrode pattern 309a and a second lower electrode pattern 311a.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The barrier layer pattern 307a is formed of refractory metal and grain boundary filling material.
      <br/>
      The first lower electrode pattern 309a is formed of a platinum group metal and the grain boundary filling material.
      <br/>
      The second lower electrode pattern 311a is formed of a platinum group metal.
      <br/>
      A high dielectric constant layer 313 and an upper electrode 315 are also included on the stacked structure.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The conductive plug 303 is formed of polysilicon.
      <br/>
      The ohmic layer 305 is formed of a metal silicide such as TiSix to improve contact resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The barrier layer pattern 307a is formed of a refractory metal, such as Ta, Mo or W, and the grain boundary filling material.
      <br/>
      The grain boundary filling material fills grain boundaries of the refractory metal so that diffusion paths of metal or oxygen can be reduced and preferably blocked.
      <br/>
      The filling material should not have chemical affinity with the metals used for an electrode and for an interconnection.
      <br/>
      Also preferably, it should not form a grain boundary during treatment at high temperature, should have high resistance with respect to high solubility in the metal and silicon and should have a high diffusion rate therein.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Therefore, it is desirable that the filling material have a high melting point, a high thermal stability, high segregation when used with the barrier layer or the electrode material, and a large atomic radius.
      <br/>
      To this end, it preferably is formed of at least one material selected from a group consisting of Ce, Zr, Y, Th, Hf, La, Al, oxides thereof.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the oxides have a structure of MO2-x (0.ltorsim.x.ltorsim.1), where M indicates material selected from a group consisting of Ce, Zr, Y, Th, Hf, La and Al.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The amount of the filling material can be changed by the deposition conditions and the composition of a target used for sputtering.
      <br/>
      As the amount of the filling material increases, the diffusion preventing characteristic may improve but the electrical property may deteriorate.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The first lower electrode pattern 309a is formed of a platinum group metal and grain boundary filling material.
      <br/>
      As is well known, the platinum group metals include the following six metals, all of which are members of Group VIII of the periodic system: ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium and platinum.
      <br/>
      A grain boundary of the metal of a platinum group is filled with the filling material, to block a diffusion path of the metal or oxygen, was the case with the barrier layer pattern 307a.
      <br/>
      The metal of a platinum group is preferably at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Pt, Ir and Ru, and the filling material is preferably at least one material selected from a group consisting of Ce, Zr, Y, Th, Hf, La, Al and oxides thereof.
      <br/>
      Thus, multiple filling materials may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The second lower electrode pattern 311a may be formed of a platinum group metal to having good leakage current characteristic.
      <br/>
      Preferably, Pt, Ir and/or Ru are used.

    <p num="42">
      The high dielectric constant layer 313 can be formed of at least one material selected from the group consisting of BST, PZT, PLZT and Ta2 O5.

    <p num="43">
      A method for fabricating high dielectric constant capacitors according to one embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 4A through 4F.
      <br/>
      In the deposition process for fabricating the high dielectric constant capacitors, it is preferable to use a radio frequency magnetron sputtering system in which deposition chambers are connected by vacuum chambers so that a substrate can move to and from the deposition chamber without exposure to air.

    <p num="44">
      FIG. 4A shows the result of forming a conductive plug 403 on the semiconductor substrate 400.

      In particular, a silicon oxide layer is deposited on a semiconductor substrate 400, to form an insulating layer 401.
      <br/>
      A predetermined portion of the insulating layer 401 is etched to form a contact hole, and then the contact hole is cleaned.
      <br/>
      Then, polysilicon including phosphorus for enhancing the conductivity is deposited to a thickness of approximately 3000  Angstrom ( +- 300  Angstrom ) on the semiconductor substrate 400 using a vertical LPCVD apparatus to form a conductive plug 403.

      In detail, a native oxide film formed on the conductive plug 403 is eliminated by radio frequency (RF) 286 plasma-etching at 200 (degree)  C. in an Ar atmosphere at 7 mTorr, and then titanium is deposited to 300  Angstrom  on the conductive plug 403 without exposure to air.
      <br/>
      The resultant structure is thermally treated in a rapid thermal annealer for 30 seconds in an NH3 atmosphere at a temperature of 750 (degree)  C., to form the ohmic layer 405 of TiSi2.
      <br/>
      Then, the structure is cleaned by H2 SO4 solution to eliminate unreacted titanium and Tix Ny on the surface of the ohmic layer 405.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      A heat treatment process is then preferably performed at 700.about.800 (degree)  C. in an atmosphere of NH3 or N2.
      <br/>
      If the heat treatment is performed at a temperature lower than 700 (degree)  C. or higher than 800 (degree)  C., and in an atmosphere of inert Ar gas, the reaction for forming TiSi2 may not be uniform, which may make the surface of the TiSi2 ohmic layer rough.

      FIG. 7 illustrates the results of X-ray diffraction analysis performed after high temperature treatment of the structures of FIGS. 4C and 4D.

      <br/>
      Therefore, an X-ray diffraction test was performed on the resultant structure of FIGS. 4B and 4D, and then on the resultant structure of FIG. 4D which is thermally treated at 650 * 800 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes using an exposed oven.

    <p num="61">
      According to the present invention, the diffusion reducing functions of a barrier layer and an electrode layer may be enhanced, so that high dielectric constant capacitors of high reliability may be obtained.
      <br/>
      In particular, diffusion of the metal or oxygen can be reduced and preferably prevented, even when using barrier layers having thicknesses of approximately 100  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      Therefore, the area in which a layer other than platinum contacts the high dielectric layer can be reduced and preferably minimized, to thereby obtain high dielectric constant capacitors having enhanced diffusion preventing characteristics and excellent leakage current characteristics.
