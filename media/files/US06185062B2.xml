      A tracking control apparatus for a tape-shaped recording medium is operative, prior to carrying out actual reproduction, to measure times from the time point serving as the reference phase position within one period of the rotary drum to the time points when timing signals of respective recording areas of the tape-shaped recording medium are detected by the head, and to calculate average values every respective recording areas of the measured times to generate a reference value on the basis of the maximum value and the minimum value of the calculated average values of the respective recording areas.
      <br/>
      Further, in actual reproduction, times from the time point serving as reference phase position to the time points when the timing signals of the tape-shaped recording medium are detected by the head are measured to control relative velocity between traveling velocity of the tape-shaped recording medium and rotational velocity of the rotary drum on the basis of result of comparison between the measured times and the reference value.
      <br/>
      Thus, even in the case where particularly the relationship between the scanning locus of the reproduction head and the track shape is not ideal, satisfactory tracking can be carried out over the entire area of the track.
      <br/>
      As a result, reliability of, e.g., digital data storage using such tracking control apparatus for tape-shaped recording medium can be improved.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to a tracking control apparatus for a tape-shaped recording medium.
      <br/>
      Specifically, this invention relates to an apparatus adapted for controlling relative velocity between traveling velocity of the tape-shaped recording medium and rotational velocity of the rotary drum to provide (apply) tracking servo (control).
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      There have been developed, e.g., Digital Audio Tape Players (hereinafter simply referred to as DAT) adapted for recording and/or reproducing digital audio data with respect to magnetic tape and Digital Data Storages in which such DAT is used to record or reproduce data of the computer.
      <br/>
      In these devices, magnetic tape is traveled in the state where the magnetic tape is wound at a wrap angle of, e.g., 90 degrees on the rotary drum, and the rotary drum is rotated to carry out recording/reproduction in accordance with the helical scan system by using the magnetic head on the rotary drum.
      <br/>
      Thus, high density recording is permitted.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In accordance with this helical scan system, inclined tracks TKA, TKB are formed on the magnetic tape as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      These inclined tracks TKA, TKB are tracks formed by, e.g., recording in which no guard band is provided (so-called azimuth full recording) by using a pair of recording heads HRA, HRB in which azimuth angles are different from each other mounted on the rotary drum.
      <br/>
      In more practical sense, respective gaps GP of the recording heads HRA, HRB are adapted so that azimuth angles  THETA A,  THETA B are provided in directions opposite to each other, and magnetization (magnetic polarization) directions of the inclined tracks TKA, TKB are different from each other as indicated by slanting lines.
      <br/>
      In this azimuth full recording, the track width TP is narrower than the width of the recording heads HRA, HRB.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Meanwhile, at the time of reproduction, the magnetic head is required to precisely trace tracks TK (inclined tracks TKA, TKB) on the magnetic tape.
      <br/>
      As this tracking control system, e.g., in the digital data storage, a tracking servo control so called timing ATF (Automatic Track Following) system is used.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In accordance with this timing ATF system, the time (or time period which will be referred to as tracking detection time) required from the reference phase position of the rotary drum until the magnetic head detects (reproduces) a predetermined signal (hereinafter referred to as a timing detection signal) from corresponding track is measured to compare that measured value and reference value to allow error therebetween to be servo error information.
      <br/>
      Then, the rotational velocity (speed) of the capstan motor for traveling the magnetic tape is controlled on the basis of this servo error information to adjust the tape traveling velocity.
      <br/>
      Namely, the tape traveling velocity is adjusted to adjust the relative velocity between the drum rotational velocity and the tape traveling velocity so that a satisfactory tracking state can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In more practical sense, as shown in FIG. 3, phase position of the rotary drum when scanning position of the magnetic head is caused to be the position of line (timing) designated as TRA in FIG. 3 with respect to a certain track is caused to be the reference phase position.
      <br/>
      At the rotary drum or the drum motor, pulse generator (PG) is disposed.
      <br/>
      At the time point when the rotary drum is located at the reference phase position during rotation, a pulse signal is generated from the PG.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to detect the timing TRA at which the rotary drum has been located at the reference phase position.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, when the magnetic head comes into contact with the magnetic tape to scan the inclined track TRA, a timing detection signal is detected as reproduction data at a predetermined position PTTP on the track.
      <br/>
      This timing detection signal serves so that pulse can be obtained at the predetermined position PTTP such as synchronizing signal or address, etc. included in reproduction data.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In this case, three different kinds of scanning loci in the tracking phase state of the magnetic head with respect to the inclined track TKA are designated as 1, 2, 3 in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The times from the timing when the magnetic head is located at the reference phase position (position of the line TRA) of the rotary drum up to the timing when the magnetic head reaches the position PTTP, i.e., tracking detection times are different from each other as respectively designated as t1, t2, t3 in the scanning states of 1, 2, 3.

      As the reference value of the tracking detection time, time t1 obtained when the magnetic head is placed in the satisfactory tracking state with respect to the track TK, i.e., in the state where it traces the center of the inclined track TKA as in the case of 1 is set in advance.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in the case where scanning as in the case of 1 is carried out at the time of tracking servo control so that time t1 is measured as the tracking detection time, the measured value becomes in correspondence with the reference value.
      <br/>
      Namely, in this case, there is no error between the measured value and the reference value, and there results satisfactory tracking state.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the case where scanning is carried out in the tracking phase state as in the case of 2 or 3, the measured value of the tracking detection time becomes equal to t2 or t3, giving rise to error with respect to the reference value.
      <br/>
      In this case, there results the state where tracking deviates by that error.
      <br/>
      By reflecting this with respect to the tape traveling velocity, the servo control then results in just the tracking state can being carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In providing (applying) tracking servo (control) by such timing ATF system, it is necessary to determine in advance the reference value.
      <br/>
      This reference value is the time (time period) from the timing of the reference phase position of the rotary drum in the just tracking state to the timing at which the timing detection signal is detected.
      <br/>
      Since the timing detection signal is generated, e.g., on the basis of detection of synchronizing signal, etc. at a predetermined position on the track, that position PTTP should be fixed at each track of various tapes.
      <br/>
      However, from a practical point of view, it cannot be avoided that positional shift may take place resulting from mechanical error, etc. at various recording equipments and reproducing equipments.
      <br/>
      For this reason, in the digital data storage, in the case where certain file data is reproduced, it is necessary to measure, prior to read-out of that data, the reference value at that tape (its file data track).
    </p>
    <p num="11">In this measurement of the reference value, there is conducted such a processing to carry out scanning in various tracking phase states with respect to the tracks to calculate, from tracking detection times measured at respective scanning operations, e.g., an average value of these detection times to allow such an average value to be the reference value.</p>
    <p num="12">
      Its operation image is shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, when scanning is carried out in plural tracking phase states TJ1.about.TJ5 different from each other with respect to, e.g., the inclined track TKA to calculate an average value of respective tracking detection times measured in those scanning operations, tracking detection time in the tracking phase state in the vicinity of the tracking phase state TJ3 is obtained.
      <br/>
      This tracking detection time is permitted to be tracking detection time substantially in the just tracking state.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is sufficient to employ this tracking detection time as the reference value.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Meanwhile, in the digital data storage etc., reproduction must be carried out with good compatibility with respect to tape cassettes recorded by various recording devices.
      <br/>
      When this applies to tracking, satisfactory tracking servo controls by the timing ATF system must be carried out with respect to various tape cassettes.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      When ideally viewed, the relationship between the track TK on the magnetic tape and scanning locus of the reproduction head is such that, as shown in FIG. 5(a), track TK is linearly formed and scanning locus of the magnetic head at the time of reproduction is in a linear form.
      <br/>
      In such an ideal state, when an approach is employed to compare tracking detection time based on timing detection signal obtained at a predetermined position PTTP on the track and reference value of tracking detection time set in advance by the operation for setting reference value to carry out servo control so that its error becomes equal to zero, scanning can be carried out in the satisfactory tracking state from the beginning to the end of the track.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      However, between various recording devices, there are mechanical errors, such as, for example, mounting position, etc. of the recording head with respect to the rotary head, and the tape traveling velocity at the time of recording is not strictly constant (fixed), but changes to some extent.
      <br/>
      Further, also in reproducing devices, there are mechanical errors such as mounting position, etc. of the reproducing head, and the tape traveling velocity also changes.
      <br/>
      It cannot be said from these various factors that ideal tracking state as shown in FIG. 5(a) can be always obtained at the time of reproduction.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      For example, as shown in FIG. 5(b), there are instances where the track TK is formed in a curved manner at the time of recording.
      <br/>
      Contrary to this, scanning locus of the reproduction head of the reproducing device is assumed to be substantially in a linear form.
      <br/>
      In this case, when setting of reference value and servo control at the time of reproduction are carried out by timing detection signal obtained at a predetermined position PTTP on the track, a tracking servo control such that just tracking state can be obtained, e.g., at the position PTTP is carried out.
      <br/>
      Namely, the scanning locus of the reproduction head results in a locus as indicated by single dotted lines in the figure.
      <br/>
      In this case, since the track TK is curved as shown in FIG. 5(b), scanning of the reproduction head deviates from the track at the last (end) portion of the track TK.
      <br/>
      In other words, satisfactory tracking state fails to be maintained over the entirety of the track TK.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Moreover, in a device such that the track TK is formed in a linear form, but the scanning locus of the reproduction head is curved as shown in FIG. 5(c), for example, when setting of the reference value and servo control at the time of reproduction are similarly carried out by the timing detection signal obtained at the position PTTP, the scanning locus of the reproduction head results in a locus as indicated by a single dotted line in FIG. 5(c), thus failing to maintain satisfactory tracking state over the entirety of the track TK.</p>
    <p num="18">
      Namely, in circumstances as shown in FIGS. 5(b), 5(c), for example, even if the tracking servo normally functions, satisfactory tracking is not carried out in practice.
      <br/>
      As a result, the error rate of reproduction data is deteriorated, leading to lowering of reliability of the device.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Meanwhile, if servo (control) is provided (applied) so that scanning locus as indicated by solid line in FIGS. 5(b), 5(c) can be obtained, tracking state of the range allowable over substantially the entirety of the track can be realized.
      <br/>
      Thus, data recorded on the track can be read out without problem.
      <br/>
      In view of this, in order to permit realization of such a scanning, there is conceivably a method in which the track is divided into plural recording areas so that timing detection signals can be obtained at plural positions to carry out the setting of the reference value on the basis of these timing detection signals.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      For example, as shown in FIG. 6, four recording areas R1.about.R4 are provided at the track TK to set positions PTTP 1.about.PTTP 4 where timing detection signals can be obtained within respective recording areas R1.about.R4. For example, setting is made such that timing detection signals can be obtained by addresses or synchronizing signals at four portions included in recorded data on the track.
      <br/>
      Then, tracking detection times corresponding to distances from the reference phase position TR of the rotary drum to respective positions PTTP 1.about.PTTP 4 are measured.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In more practical sense, with respect to the position PTTP 1 time tR1 from the time point of the reference phase position TR to the time point when timing detection signal can be obtained at the position PTTP 1 is measured to allow this time tR1 to be tracking detection time.
      <br/>
      With respect to the position PTTP 2, time tR2 from the time point of the reference phase position TR to the time point when the timing detection signal can be obtained at position PTTP 2 is measured to allow the value obtained by subtracting the standard time difference TLa from the above-mentioned time tR2 to be tracking detection time.
      <br/>
      This standard time difference TLa is the standard time required for scanning from the position PTTP 1 to the position PTTP 2.
      <br/>
      With respect to the position PTTP 3, time tR3 from the time point of the reference phase position TR to the time point when the timing detection signal is obtained at position PTTP 3 is measured to allow value obtained by subtracting the standard time difference TLb from the above-mentioned time tR3 to be tracking detection time.
      <br/>
      This standard time difference TLb is the standard time required for scanning from the position PTTP 1 to the position PTTP 3.
      <br/>
      With respect to the position PTTP 4, time tR4 from the time point of the reference phase position TR to the time point when the timing detection signal is obtained at position PTTP 4 is measured to allow value obtained by subtracting the standard time difference TLc from the above-mentioned time tR4 to be tracking detection time.
      <br/>
      This standard time difference TLc is the standard time required for scanning from the position PTTP 1 to the position PTTP 4.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      When tracking detection times corresponding to respective positions PTTP 1 to PTTP 4 are measured as stated above in an ideal state as shown in FIG. 5(a), tracking detection times corresponding to the respective positions PTTP 1.about.PTTP 4 take the same value.
      <br/>
      However, since ideal tracking states are respectively different in the respective recording areas R1.about.R4 under the state as shown in FIGS. 5(b), 5(c), tracking detection times in the just tracking state at respective positions PTTP 1.about.PTTP 4 take different values.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In this case, when an average value of respective tracking detection times corresponding to the respective positions PTTP 1.about.PTTP 4 is determined, this average value takes a value capable of obtaining equivalent tracking state to some extent in the respective recording areas R1.about.R4. In view of the above, the operation to determine respective tracking detection times in plural recording areas within one track as stated above is executed in various tracking phase states as shown in FIG. 4 to obtain plural tracking detection times.
      <br/>
      Then, an average value of these tracking detection times is determined.
      <br/>
      This average value takes a value corresponding to the tracking state within a range allowable (tolerable) to some extent in the respective recording areas R1.about.R4. Namely, if this average value is assumed as the reference value, scanning as indicated by solid line in FIGS. 5(b), 5(c), for example, can be carried out.
      <br/>
      Namely, reasonable reproduction operation can be carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      However, with such a method, when there is dispersion in the number of tracking detection times measured every recording areas, reference value for obtaining substantially satisfactory tracking over the entire area of the track cannot be obtained.
      <br/>
      In more practical sense, consider the case where scanning for setting reference value is carried out with respect to the track TK formed in a curved manner as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      As has been explained with reference to FIG. 4, it is preferable to obtain the tracking detection time for setting the reference value in diverse tracking phase states.
      <br/>
      In view of this, it is now assumed that scanning for measurement of the tracking detection time is carried out in tracking phase states designated at 4, 5, 6 in FIG. 7, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In this case, in the case of the scanning 5, timing detection signals can be obtained from respective positions PTTP 1.about.PTTP 4, and tracking detection times respectively corresponding to the positions PTTP 1.about.PTTP 4 can be thus obtained.
      <br/>
      However, in the case of the scanning 4, timing detection signals can be obtained only from the positions PTTP 1, PTTP 2.
      <br/>
      As a result, only two tracking detection times corresponding to the positions PTTP 1, PTTP 2 can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In addition, in the case of the scanning 6, timing detection signal can be obtained only from the position PTTP 4.
      <br/>
      As a result, only one tracking detection time corresponding to the position PTTP 4 can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The above-mentioned explanation has been given only for illustrative purpose.
      <br/>
      In practice, the number of tracking detection times corresponding to respective positions PTTP 1.about.PTTP 4 considerably varies by such relative shift between the track and the scanning loci.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the above-described average value does not necessarily result in the value equally reflecting the tracking states with respect to all the recording areas R1.about.R4. As a result, it cannot be said that scanning as indicated by solid line of FIGS. 5(b), 5(c) can be necessarily realized.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Moreover, it is conceivable to employ an approach to determine, at every one of the recording areas, average values of tracking detection times respectively obtained at the positions PTTP 1.about.PTTP 4 to further average these average values in the entire recording area.
      <br/>
      When such an approach is employed, influence of variations in the number of tracking detection times at respective positions PTTP 1.about.PTTP 4 can be reduced.
      <br/>
      However, employment of this average value as the reference value allows the recording area where off track quantity is largely apt to take place.
      <br/>
      It is now assumed that, e.g., average values in the recording areas R1, R2, R3 are substantially equal to each other, and the average value of the recording area R4 has a greatly different value.
      <br/>
      In this case, when average values of the recording areas R1.about.R4 are averaged to allow such average value to be reference value, that value becomes equal to a value which has greatly reflected off track quantities in the recording areas R1, R2, R3, i.e., there is the possibility that tracking may greatly deviate in the recording area R4.
    </p>
    <p num="28">As stated above, in the conventional tracking control apparatus employing the timing ATF system, in the case where the relationship between scanning locus of the magnetic head at the time of reproduction and the track shape is not ideal, there was the problem that it is difficult to maintain satisfactory tracking over the entire area of the track in a manner corresponding thereto, resulting in partially deteriorated error rate.</p>

      FIG. 8 shows tracks formed on a magnetic tape 90 by the helical scan system.

    <p num="41">
      Respective tracks TK are successively formed as track of width TW by recording in which no guard band is provided (the so-called azimuth full recording) by using recording head (not shown).
      <br/>
      Tracks adjacent to each other are tracks recorded by recording heads having azimuth angles opposite to each other, wherein tracks formed by the recording head having one azimuth angle are assumed as inclined tracks TKA, and tracks formed by the recording head having the other azimuth angle are assumed as inclined tracks TKB.

      At the time of reproduction of data, tracks TK are scanned by a reproduction head 16.
      <br/>
      The width HW of the reproduction head 16 is broader than the track width TW, but cross talk from adjacent tracks can be prevented by the so-called azimuth effect.

      As shown in FIG. 9(a), one track is adapted so that margin areas are provided at respective both ends, and the area put between these margin areas is caused to serve as main data area.
      <br/>
      The main data area is divided into 96 fragments to which fragment addresses of 0.about.95 are given.

    <p num="45">
      As shown in FIG. 9(b), one fragment consists of 133 bytes.

      As shown in FIG. 9(b), synchronizing (sync) areas of 1 byte are provided at leading portions of respective 78 fragments of which fragment addresses are 9.about.86, and synchronizing (sync) signals which takes a predetermined pulse form are recorded therein.
      <br/>
      Succeedingly (subsequently) to the synchronizing signal area, address and sub code areas of 6 bytes are provided.

      Fragment address of 1 byte and sub code of 5 bytes are recorded therein.

      Succeedingly (subsequently) thereto, header parity area of 2 bytes is provided.

      Further, succeedingly (subsequently) thereto, data area of 112 bytes is provided.
      <br/>
      Actual data is recorded into this data area.
      <br/>
      The last 12 bytes of the fragment is caused to serve as ECC area.
      <br/>
      So called C1 error correction code is recorded in this ECC area.
      <br/>
      This C1 error correction code is error correction code with respect to data within the fragment, i.e., the error correction processing is completed in fragment units.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      As shown in FIG. 9(c), at respective 18 fragments of which fragment addresses are 0.about.8 and 87.about.95, synchronizing (sync) signal area, address and sub code areas, header parity area and ECC area are provided similarly to the fragment of FIG. 9(b).
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that the area of 112 bytes which has been caused to be data area in the fragment of FIG. 9(b) is caused to serve as the ECC area, and C2 error correction code is recorded therein.
      <br/>
      The C2 error correction code is error correction code of the series completed within one track.

    <p num="47">
      As the error correction code, there is further provided C3 error correction code.
      <br/>
      This C3 error correction code is recorded in the ECC frame shown in the FIG. 8 mentioned above.
      <br/>
      This C3 error correction code is the error correction code of the series completed within one group.
      <br/>
      Moreover, by error detection using the C1 error correction code and the C3 error correction code, at which portion error takes place within one track can be confirmed.
      <br/>
      However, because the C2 error correction code is recorded after undergone interleaving within one track, it is impossible to confirm error occurrence position within one track by error detection using the C2 error correction code.

      The recording data generated in this way is delivered to a recording amplifier 13.

      <br/>
      Then, the servo circuit 30 compares the measured tracking detection time and reference value set in advance to thereby obtain tracking error information to apply drive voltage corresponding to the tracking error information to the capstan motor 35 through the capstan motor driver 34 to thereby increase or decrease the rotational velocity of the capstan 28 to provide (apply) tracking servo.

    <p num="72">3. More practical configuration and operation of the servo circuit 30 for providing (applying) tracking servo by the timing ATF system</p>
    <p num="73">The more practical configuration of the servo circuit 30 for carrying out tracking servo control by the timing ATF system is shown in FIG. 12. The servo circuit 30 comprises, as the circuitry for carrying out servo control of the capstan in the timing ATF system, a timing ATF processing section 61, a switching pulse (SWP) generating section 62, a free running counter 63, a servo switch 64, a capstan reference velocity generating section 65, a subtracter 66, and a velocity servo signal generating section 67.</p>
    <p num="74">
      In the case where, e.g., at the time of recording, the tracking servo is caused to be in OFF state and the capstan 28 is rotationally driven at a constant velocity, the servo switch 64 is turned OFF by servo ON/OFF control signal TSON/OFF delivered from the system controller 31.
      <br/>
      In this case, the capstan reference velocity generating section 65 generates a signal corresponding to a velocity desired to be set as the rotational velocity of the capstan 28 to deliver it to the velocity servo signal generating section 67 as target velocity signal CV through the subtracter 66 as it is.
      <br/>
      Moreover, this velocity servo signal generating section 67 is supplied with pulse FGc, i.e., pulse of frequency (signal) corresponding to the rotational velocity of the capstan 28 from the capstan FG40.
      <br/>
      The velocity servo signal generating section 67 detects the current rotational velocity of the capstan 28 from the above-mentioned pulse FGc.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      Further, the velocity servo signal generating section 67 compares current rotational velocity detected from the pulse FGc and target velocity signal CV indicating the target rotational velocity to deliver its error to the capstan motor driver 34 as a capstan servo signal Scp.
      <br/>
      The capstan motor driver 34 drives the capstan motor 35, e.g., by three phase drive currents to rotate the capstan 28, i.e., control the drive voltage with respect to the capstan motor 35 on the basis of the capstan servo signal Scp to thereby carry out servo control such that the rotational velocity of the capstan 28 is converged into the target velocity signal CV generated from the capstan reference velocity generating section 65.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Accordingly, when the target velocity signal CV generated from the capstan reference velocity generating section 65 is assumed to be a signal at a tape traveling velocity at the time of ordinary recording/reproduction (hereinafter referred to as velocity of one time), the capstan 28 is rotated at a constant velocity of velocity of one time.
      <br/>
      When the target velocity signal CV is assumed to be double velocity, the capstan 28 is rotated at a constant velocity of double velocity.
      <br/>
      Namely, the target velocity signal CV generated from the capstan reference velocity generating section 65 is varied, thereby making it possible to change the tape traveling velocity.
      <br/>
      The system controller 31 controls target velocity signal CV generated at the capstan reference velocity generating section 65 in dependency upon the operating state at that time.
      <br/>
      For example, the tape traveling velocity can be changed in such a manner that the target velocity signal CV is caused to be the velocity of one time at the time of reproduction and is caused to be the multiple velocity of x at the time of tape fast feed reproduction.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      On the other hand, in the case where the tracking control is carried out at the time of reproduction, the servo switch 64 is caused to be turned ON.
      <br/>
      Then, the timing ATF processing section 61 detects tracking error on the basis of timing detection pulse TTP from the timing detection pulse generating circuit 27 and switching pulse SWP generated at the switching pulse generating section 62 to deliver this tracking error to the subtracter 66.
      <br/>
      The subtracter 66 subtracts its error from the value generated at the capstan reference velocity generating section 65 to thereby generate target velocity signal CV.
      <br/>
      Namely, in this case, the target velocity signal CV is increased or decreased in accordance with tracking error with a predetermined velocity (e.g., velocity of one time) being as the center.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the tape traveling velocity is accelerated/decelerated with the predetermined velocity being as the center in dependency upon the tracking state, whereby it is converged into just the tracking state.
      <br/>
      Since the tracking error becomes equal to substantially zero when tracking is stable, the tape traveling velocity becomes equal to, e.g., a substantially predetermined velocity.

      This switching pulse SWP is a signal serving as reference for carrying out switching between the reproduction head 16A of the A channel and the reproduction head 16B of the B channel, and is delivered also to other various circuits which are not shown in FIG. 12.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      The time period during which the switching pulse SWP is at "L" level is the time period during which data reproduced by the reproduction head 16A is processed.
      <br/>
      For this time period, scanning of the reproduction head 16A with respect to the inclined track TKA is carried out.
      <br/>
      Thus, as shown in FIG. 13(d), a reproduction signal (RF signal) obtained as the result of the fact that the reproduction head 16A scans the inclined track TKA can be obtained.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the time period during which the switching pulse SWP is at "H" level is the time period during which data reproduced by the reproduction head 16B is processed.
      <br/>
      For this time period, scanning of the reproduction head 16B with respect to the inclined track TKB is carried out.
      <br/>
      Thus, as shown in FIG. 13(d), a reproduction signal resulting from the fact that the reproduction head 16B scans the inclined track TKB can be obtained.

    <p num="83">
      The timing ATF processing section 61 allows the falling timing of the switching pulse SWP to be reference phase position of the rotary drum serving as reference of the timing ATF operation with respect to the inclined track TKA.
      <br/>
      Namely, this timing corresponds to the timing TRA which has been explained with reference to.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 of the background art.
      <br/>
      Further, the timing ATF processing section 61 measures tracking detection time MTTP (A) which is the time from this timing TRA up to the time point when the timing detection pulse TTP is inputted.
      <br/>
      Namely, the timing ATF processing section 61 measures time from the timing of the reference phase position of the rotary drum up to the time point when the reproduction head 16A detects, e.g., fragment address recorded at a predetermined position on the track.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that while tracking detection time MTTP (A) from the timing of the reference phase position of the rotary drum up to the first timing detection pulse TTP corresponding to the position PTTP 1 is shown in FIG. 13(e), the timing ATF processing section 61 measures time from timing of the reference phase position of the rotary drum also with respect to other timing detection pulses TTP (second timing detection pulse TTP and pulses subsequent thereto) to subtract, from this time, times up to the first timing detection pulse TTP to measure tracking detection times MTTP (A) corresponding to other positions PTTP 2, PTTP 3, PTTP 4.

    <p num="84">
      While, in this embodiment, respective four timing detection pulses TTP are utilized in setting the reference value which will be described later, an approach may be employed at the time of reproduction to measure tracking detection time MTTP (A) by utilizing one of these pulses to compare it with the reference value to thereby detect tracking error information, or to respectively measure tracking detection times MTTP (A) by utilizing respective two.about.four timing detection pulses TTP to compare them with the reference value to thereby detect tracking error information.
      <br/>
      As stated above, this invention is not limited to the embodiment in which four timing detection pulses TTP are utilized.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The timing ATF processing section 61 measures the tracking detection time MTTP (A) by using the free running counter 63.
      <br/>
      Namely, the timing ATF processing section 61 latches count value of the free running counter 63, e.g., at falling timing TRA of switching pulse SWP delivered from the switching pulse generating section 62, and latches count value of the free running counter 63 at input timing of the timing detection pulse TTP.
      <br/>
      Then, the timing ATF processing section 61 determines the difference between these two count values (with respect to the second timing detection pulse TTP and pulses subsequent thereto, further determines time differences between those detection pulses and the first timing detection pulse TTP) to thereby measure tracking detection time MTTP (A).
      <br/>
      Then, the timing ATF processing section 61 compares the tracking detection time MTTP (A) thus determined with reference value set in advance (reference value for inclined track TKA) to determine the difference therebetween to allow this difference to be tracking error information with respect to the inclined track TKA.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Moreover, with respect to the inclined track TKB, the timing ATF processing section 61 allows the rising timing of the switching pulse SWP to be reference phase position of the rotary drum serving as reference of the timing ATF operation.

      Then, the timing ATF processing section 61 measures, similarly by using the free running counter 63, the tracking detection time MTTP (B) which is the time from the timing TRB corresponding to the reference phase position up to the time point when the timing detection pulse TTP is inputted.
      <br/>
      Then, the timing ATF processing section 61 compares measured value of the tracking detection time MTTP (B) thus determined with reference value set in advance (reference value for inclined track TKB) to determine its difference to allow this difference to be tracking error information with respect to the inclined track TKB.

    <p num="87">As has been explained also in FIG. 3, in this digital data storage, tracking error information obtained in this way is inputted to the subtracter 66 to reflect it with respect to the target velocity signal CV to control the rotational velocity of the capstan 28 to thereby adjust relative velocity between the drum rotational velocity and the tape traveling velocity so that satisfactory tracking state can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="88">4. First embodiment of reference value setting scheme</p>
    <p num="89">Meanwhile, in order to satisfactorily carry out tracking servo control based on such a timing ATF system, the above-described reference value must be set to reasonable value.</p>
    <p num="90">
      As has been explained with reference to FIG. 4 of the background art, the reference value can be essentially determined by totaling (calculating) tracking detection times detected in scanning in various tracking phase states to determine its average value.
      <br/>
      However, the reference value is required to have such a value capable of coping with the state as in FIGS. 5(b), 5(c) shown in the background art.
      <br/>
      In view of this, in this embodiment, the reference value is set by such an operation which will be described below.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      In setting the reference value, a necessary number of scanning operations of the reproduction head in various tracking phase states are carried out to some degree to determine tracking detection times MTTP (A), MTTP (B) respectively corresponding to various inclined tracks TKA, TKB.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, since four timing detection pulses TTP are obtained per each track, four tracking detection times MTTP (A), MTTP (B) are measured per each track.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      In setting reference value, as shown in FIG. 14, four example, scanning by the reproduction head 16 (hereinafter simply referred to as reproduction scanning) is repeatedly carried out.
      <br/>
      Namely, the tracking servo is caused to be in OFF state (the servo switch 64 is caused to be in OFF state) and, e.g., the tape traveling velocity is caused to be velocity different from the velocity in the ordinary reproduction operation (velocity of one time), thus to carry out reproduction scanning by the reproduction heads 16A, 16B.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, when the tape traveling velocity is velocity of one time, the scanning phase position of the reproduction head 16A changes by 360 degrees every scanning.
      <br/>
      Namely, in the case where, e.g., the reproduction head 16A scans the center of a certain A azimuth track TKA, the reproduction head 16A subsequently scans the center (the same tracking phase) of the next A azimuth track TKB through the B azimuth track TKB.
      <br/>
      This similarly applies to the reproduction head 16B.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the tape traveling velocity is set to velocity different from velocity of one time to carry out reproduction scanning by the reproduction heads 16A, 16B, tracking phase deviates (shifts) every scanning as shown in FIG. 14, for example.
      <br/>
      As a result, tracking detection times MTTP (A), MTTP (B) in various tracking phase states are obtained.
      <br/>
      In this example, SA1.about.SA10--indicated by solid lines indicate various scanning loci of the reproduction head 16A in various tracking phase states, and SB1.about.SB10--indicated by broken lines indicate various scanning loci of the reproduction head 16B in various tracking phase states.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Moreover, in respective scanning operations, timing detection pulses TTP are respectively detected at positions APTTP 1.about.APTTP 4 with respect to the A azimuth track TKA in correspondence with respective recording areas R1.about.R4 on the track TK.
      <br/>
      Further, with respect to the B azimuth track TKB, timing detection pulses TTP are respectively detected at positions BPTTP 1.about.BPTTP 4.
      <br/>
      Thus, with respect to respective tracks, tracking detection times MTTP (A), MTTP (B) respectively corresponding to four recording areas R1.about.R4 are obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      It is to be noted that when the reproduction head 16A scans in the tracking phase state greatly deviating from the A azimuth track TKA, e.g., when it scans the portion in the vicinity of center of the B azimuth track TKB, timing detection pulse TTP cannot be obtained.
      <br/>
      Similarly, when the reproduction 16B scans in the tracking phase state greatly deviating from the B azimuth track TKB, the timing detection pulse TTP cannot be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      When the reproduction heads 16A, 16B respectively scan corresponding inclined tracks TKA, TKB, four timing detection pulses TTP are essentially detected by the scanning.
      <br/>
      However, these four timing detection pulses TTP can be obtained only when the relationship between the scanning locus of the reproduction head and linearity of track is in ideal state (or the track TK and the scanning locus are curved by the same curvature so that there results the state where the linear relationship is in ideal state when equivalently viewed).
    </p>
    <p num="96">For example, in the more practical example shown in FIG. 14, the inclined tracks TKA, TKB are curved, but it cannot be said that there results the ideal state because the scanning locus of the reproduction head is assumed to be linear.</p>
    <p num="97">In order to have ability of also coping with such a case, in calculation of the reference value of this embodiment, an approach is employed to determine, at every respective recording area, average values of plural tracking detection times obtained in the respective recording areas R1.about.R4 to detect the maximum value and the minimum value of the average values of the respective recording areas to further allow average value of the maximum value and the minimum value to be the reference value.</p>
    <p num="98">
      The principle of the calculation of the reference value is shown in FIG. 15. In this FIG. 15, the state where the relationship between the track and the scanning locus is in ideal state is indicated as a linear line of the abscissa.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, in actual scanning, the relationship between the track and the scanning locus deviates from the ideal state as indicated by broken lines.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      For example, when scanning as shown in FIG. 14 is carried out to total (calculate) plural tracking detection times to determine average values of the tracking detection times in respective recording areas, average values AV1.about.AV4 indicated by circle  (large circle)  on broken lines are obtained as shown in FIG. 15. In this case, the maximum value and the minimum value of the average values AV1.about.AV4 are respectively average value AV2 and average value AV4.
      <br/>
      Further, when an average value of these average values AV2, AV4 is determined, its value is suitable (reasonable) reference value capable of obtaining substantially allowable (tolerable) tracking states in the entire area of the track TK in the relationship between the curved track TK and the linear scanning locus as shown in FIG. 14. Namely, this average value is caused to be reference value, thereby making it possible to provide (apply) tracking servo so that scanning locus S as shown in FIG. 16 can be obtained with respect to the relationship between the track TK and the scanning locus which is not ideal state.
      <br/>
      Thus, suitable (reasonable) reproduction operation can be carried out over the entire area of the track TK.
      <br/>
      As a result, it can be also avoided that the error rate is partially deteriorated.

      Namely, the reference value register 81 is a register for holding reference values TB(A), TB(B) set by the operation for setting the reference value which will be described later so that these reference values TB(A), TB(B) are used in the subsequent tracking servo control based on the timing ATF system.

      <br/>
      In more practical sense, e.g., in tracking phase state as shown in FIG. 14, the reproduction heads 16A, 16B respectively carry out about 30 times of scanning operations, and the arithmetic section 80 accumulates tracking detection times MTTP (A), MTTP (B) at that time.

    </p>
    <p num="117">More practical processing at the step F102 will now be described with reference to the flowchart shown in FIGS. 20 and 21. The processing for measurement of tracking detection times and calculation of its accumulated value at the step F102 consists of TTP interrupt processing shown in FIG. 20 and SWP interrupt processing shown in FIG. 21. The TTP interrupt processing is started at the time point when timing detection pulse TTP from the timing detection pulse generating circuit 27 is inputted to the arithmetic section 80.</p>
    <p num="118">At step F201, the arithmetic section 80 is operative so that when the timing detection pulse TTP is inputted thereto, it takes thereinto, as timing T1, count value of the free running counter 63 at that time point.</p>

      This edge timing MSWP corresponds to the timing TR (timing TRA or TRB shown in FIG. 13) at the reference phase position of the rotary drum 50.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the time T2 is time from the timing TR at the reference phase position of the rotary drum 50 to the time point when the timing detection pulse TTP is inputted.
      <br/>
      Namely, the time T2 is any value of times tR1, tR2, tR3, tR4 shown in FIG. 6.

      In more practical sense, as also seen from FIG. 6, for example, the arithmetic section 80 is operative so that when it has judged that corresponding timing detection pulse TTP is the timing detection pulse TTP from the recording area R4, it calculates T2-TLc to allow its value to be time T3.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the arithmetic section 80 is operative so that when it has judged that corresponding timing detection pulse TTP is the timing detection pulse TTP from the recording area R3, it calculates T2-TLb to allow its value to be time T3.

      Further, the arithmetic section 80 is operative so that when corresponding timing detection pulse is the timing detection pulse TTP from the recording area R2, it calculates T2-TLa to allow its value to be time T3.
      <br/>
      In addition, the arithmetic section 80 is operative so that when it has judged that corresponding timing detection pulse is the timing detection pulse TTP from the recording area R1, it allows the time T2 to be time T3 as it is because subtraction is unnecessary in this case.

      The time T3 calculated in this way is the tracking detection time MTTP measured on the basis of the timing detection pulse TTP in a certain recording area (tracking detection time MTTP (A) or tracking detection time MTTP (B) of FIG. 13),

      At step F205, the arithmetic section 80 writes this time T3 into the TTP timing register 83 as the tracking detection time with respect to the judged recording area.

      <br/>
      At times subsequent thereto, similarly, the arithmetic section 80 is operative so that in the case where the time T3 corresponds to respective recording areas R2, R3, R4, it stores the time T3 into the TTP timing register 83 as tracking detection times MTTP (2), MTTP (3), MTTP (4)

      Such TTP interrupt processing is carried out four times at the maximum in accordance with input of the timing detection pulse TTP during scanning of one track.

      It is to be noted that, as has been explained with reference to FIG. 7, it is not limited that four timing detection pulses TTP can be necessarily obtained for one track scanning period.

      For this reason, there are instances where as data of TTP timing register 83 at the time point when scanning of one track is completed, there exist data in which any value of the tracking detection times MTTP (1).about.MTTP (4) remains to be zero (value at the time of clear), i.e., the tracking detection time is not measured.
      <br/>
      In addition, there are also instances where all of tracking detection times MTTP (1).about.MTTP (4) cannot be measured.
    </p>
    <p num="124">The arithmetic section 80 is operative so that when it detects edge of the switching pulse SWP, it starts the SWP interrupt processing shown in FIG. 21.</p>
    <p num="125">
      At step F301, the arithmetic section 80 confirms storage state of the TTP timing register 82.
      <br/>
      Namely, the arithmetic section 80 discriminates the tracking detection time newly measured at track scanning immediately before of the tracking detection times MTTP (1).about.MTTP (4).
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      At step F302, the arithmetic section 80 carries out write/addition processing with respect to the A channel calculation register 84 and the B channel calculation register 85 in correspondence with the tracking detection time newly written into the TTP timing register 82.
      <br/>
      In more practical sense, since the arithmetic section 80 is operative so that when it detects falling edge of the switching pulse SWP to start the SWP interrupt processing, it holds, in the TTP timing register 82, tracking detection times MTTP (1).about.MTTP (4) measured at the B azimuth track immediately before that time.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the arithmetic section 80 adds tracking detection time or times in which values exists of the MTTP (1).about.MTTP (4) to accumulated value of corresponding recording areas of the B channel calculation register 85.
      <br/>
      Namely, the arithmetic section 80 adds the tracking detection time MTTP (x) to the accumulated value MSUM (x) held in the B channel calculation register 85 to update the accumulated value MSUM (x).
      <br/>
      When the arithmetic section 80 holds only tracking detection times MTTP (1), MTTP (2) as measured value, e.g., in the TTP timing register 82, it updates the accumulated value MSUM (1), the accumulated value MSUM (2).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, since when the arithmetic section 80 detects rising edge of the switching pulse SWP to start SWP interrupt processing, it holds, in the TTP timing register 82, tracking detection times MTTP (1).about.MTTP (4) measured at the A azimuth track immediately before that time, it adds tracking detection time or times in which value exists of these tracking detection times MTTP (1).about.MTTP (4) to the accumulated value of corresponding recording area of the A channel calculation register 84.
      <br/>
      Namely, the arithmetic section 80 adds the tracking detection time MTTP (x) to the accumulated value MSUM (x) held at the A-channel calculation register 84 to update the accumulated value MSUM (x).
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      At step F303, the arithmetic section 80 increments addition number values MNUM (x) of the A-channel calculation register 84 or the B-channel calculation register 85 in correspondence with the updated accumulated value MSUM (x).
      <br/>
      Thus, the arithmetic section 80 completes processing with respect to scanning immediately before track.

    <p num="128">
      At step F304, the arithmetic section 80 carries out preparation processing with respect to the next track scanning.

      Namely, the arithmetic section 80 takes thereinto count value of the free running counter 63 at the time point when the edge of the switching pulse SWP is detected to allow it to be edge timing MSWP of the switching pulse.
      <br/>
      This is a value used at step F202 in the next TTP interrupt processing.

      Moreover, the numbers of tracking detection times totaled (calculated) in correspondence with these accumulated values MSUM (1).about.MSUM (4) are held as addition number values MNUM (1).about.MNUM (4).

      Similarly, accumulated values of tracking detection times measured when scanning is carried out in various tracking phase states are held as accumulated values MSUM (1).about.MSUM (4) at every respective R1.about.R4 recording areas of the B azimuth track TKB into the B-channel calculation register 85, and the numbers of tracking detection times totaled (calculated) in correspondence with the accumulated values MSUM (1).about.MSUM (4) are held as addition number value MNUM (1).about.MNUM (4).

      At steps F401.about.F404, the arithmetic section 80 determines average values AV1.about.AV4 of tracking detection times measured at every respective recording areas.

      <br/>
      Similarly, the arithmetic section 80 determines average values AV3, AV4 with respect to the recording areas R3, R4.

      <br/>
      The reference value TB(A) and the reference value TB(B) calculated in this way are written into the reference value register 81 at the step F104 of FIG. 19. Thus, reference value setting processing is completed.

      Even in a case such that the relationship between the scanning locus and linearlity of track is not in the ideal state as has been explained with reference to FIGS. 15, 16, the reference values set as stated above are reference values capable of carrying out scanning within the tracking error which is allowable (tolerable) to some extent over the entire area of the track.
      <br/>
      Even in the case where the ideal relationship between the track and the scanning locus cannot be obtained, it is possible to prevent that tracking greatly deviates at the time of reproduction so that error rate is increased.

    <p num="139">It is to be noted that while this invention has been described by using the embodiment in which the track is divided into four recording areas to detect timing detection pulses TTP, this invention can be also applied to the case where the track is divided into three recording areas or more to detect the timing detection pulses TTP thus to set reference values.</p>
    <p num="140">5. Second embodiment of reference value setting scheme</p>
    <p num="141">
      The second embodiment of the reference value setting scheme will now be described.
      <br/>
      This embodiment contemplates realizing a tracking servo control such that when any uncorrectable error takes place or takes place frequently in a certain recording area at the time of reproduction, such error can be eliminated.
      <br/>
      In other words, reference value is set in accordance with the error occurrence situations.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      In order to set the reference value in dependency upon such error occurrence situations, the system controller 31 monitors error occurrence situations at the time of reproduction operation.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 10, the error correction processing is carried out in the C1 decoder 23, the C2 decoder 24 and the C3 decoder 25.
      <br/>
      These respective decoders 23, 24, 25 deliver uncorrectable error occurrence signal to the system controller 31 in the case where uncorrectable error exists.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      As described above, when uncorrectable error takes place, the error correction code C1 and the error correction code C3 can detect the portion where that error has taken place as position on the track TK.

      Namely, since the error correction code C1 is completed in the fragment units, it is possible to confirm the position on the track TK where uncorrectable error has taken place from corresponding fragment address.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since the error correction code C3 is error correction code added in group units in the track direction, it is possible to confirm position of uncorrectable error on the track TK by using the error correction code C3.

      Namely, the system controller 31 monitors processing result by the error correction codes C1, C3 to discriminate occurrence situations of uncorrectable error with respect to the respective recording areas R1.about.R4.

    <p num="156">
      In this second embodiment of reference value setting scheme, in the case where it is observed that uncorrectable error takes place more frequently in a specific recording area as compared to other recording areas, the arithmetic section 80 carries out processing in accordance with the flowchart shown in FIG. 24 in setting the next reference value.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that the entire processing as the reference value setting scheme is the same as the above-described processing of FIG. 19, and processing of FIG. 24 is carried out as the processing of the step F103 of FIG. 19 in place of the above-described processing of FIG. 22. Moreover, processing at steps F601.about.F606 shown in FIG. 24 are the same as the processing at the steps F401.about.F406 shown in FIG. 22. Namely, at the steps F601.about.F606, the arithmetic section 80 determines average values AV1.about.AV4 of tracking detection times in respective recording areas from tracking detection times held at the A-channel calculation register 84 or the B-channel calculation register 85 to further specify the maximum average value AVMAX and the minimum average value AVMIN thereamong.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, explanation is omitted in connection with the detail of the processing of the steps F601.about.F606.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      At step F607, the arithmetic section 80 discriminates the maximum value of respective values of error counters RE1NUM.about.RE4NUM delivered from the system controller 31 to judge (discriminate) the recording area where the number of error occurrence times is the maximum, or the recording area where uncorrectable error has taken place at least once.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that in the case where respective values of the error counters RE1NUM.about.RE4NUM have substantially the same level, there may be employed an approach such that any certain one value is not detected as the maximum value.
      <br/>
      Namely, while in such a sense to judge the recording area where the number of error occurrence times is conspicuously large, respective values of the error counters RE1NUM.about.RE4NUM are different values, in the case where they are assumed to have substantially the same level, judgment may be made such that there is no value corresponding to the maximum value to calculate the reference value by the processing of the step F407 shown in FIG. 22. In addition, with respect to the recording areas where uncorrectable error has taken place at least once, all of those areas may be caused to correspond to the recording area where the number of error occurrence times is the maximum, which is referred to here.
    </p>
    <p num="158">At step F608, the arithmetic section 80 allows an average value corresponding to recording areas where the number of error occurrence times is conspicuously large among average values AV1.about.AV4 to be AVE.</p>
    <p num="159">
      At step F609, the arithmetic section 80 weights the average value AVE to determine average value of the maximum average value AVMAX, the minimum average value AVMIN and the average value AVE.
      <br/>
      In more practical sense, the arithmetic section 80 determines, e.g., average value of the maximum average value AVMAX and the minimum average value AVMIN thereafter to determine an average value of that average value and value obtained by multiplying the average value AVE by coefficient K to allow it to be reference value TB.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      In the second embodiment of the reference value setting scheme, as described above, weight is applied to the average value AV of the recording area where error has taken place as described above so that the average value is more greatly reflected (this is referred to as operation to increase specific gravity), thus to calculate reference value TB(TB(A) and TB(B)).
      <br/>
      Thus, in the tracking servo control by the timing ATF system based on the reference value TB, the tracking state in the recording area where error occurrence frequency is high can be caused to be a more reasonable state.
      <br/>
      As a result, occurrence of error can be prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      While such an operation may be carried out in ordinary reproduction, this operation is effective particularly in such a case of reproducing the same portion for a second time by error of reproduced data (hereinafter referred to as reproduction retry).
      <br/>
      Namely, since, at the time of reproduction retry, tracking in which importance is attached to the portion where data cannot be reproduced is carried out on the basis of such reference value, reproduction of data for a second time can be carried out efficiently and in short time as compared to the case where the tracking state is caused to be changed at random to carry out reproduction retry.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      Moreover, in the case where error occurrence frequency is caused to be high in other recording area in the reproduction operation after the reference value TB is set by such a method, similar reference value setting processing is carried out for a second time to increase specific gravity of the average value AV of that recording area to set the reference value.
      <br/>
      By repeating such an operation, the reference value is converged into the optimum value.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      It is to be noted that while the recording area in which the specific gravity is increased in calculation of the reference value is assumed to be the recording area where the error occurrence frequency is high, equipments adapted for handling data of computer such as digital data storage, etc. is required to completely eliminate occurrence of uncorrectable error.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the meaning of "error occurrence frequency is high" is equivalent to the fact that if uncorrectable error takes place at least once in a certain recording area, this corresponds to the fact that error occurrence frequency is high to carry out reference value setting processing.
    </p>
    <p num="164">On the other hand, in devices such that error is allowable (tolerable) to some extent like digital audio tape player (DAT) for recording/reproducing, e.g., speech signal as digital signal, in the case where uncorrectable error repeatedly takes place, specific gravity may be increased with respect to the average value AV of that recording area.</p>
    <p num="165">
      Meanwhile, as a method of calculating the reference value TB at the step F609 in which specific gravity is increased with respect to the recording area where error takes place, there are various calculation methods in addition to the above.
      <br/>
      For example, a calculation may be made in a manner as indicated by the following formula:
      <br/>
      TB=+(AV1+AV2+AV3+AV4)/2+AVE K}/2
    </p>
    <p num="166">In addition, in the case where error takes place at considerably high frequency in plural recording areas, an average of average values of tracking detection times corresponding to those plural recording areas may be determined.</p>
    <p num="167">It is to be noted that the technology for increasing specific gravity of average value of the recording areas where error takes place in this embodiment can be applied to the case where two recording areas or more are set per at least one track to obtain two timing detection pulses or more.</p>
    <p num="168">6. Third embodiment of reference value setting scheme</p>
    <p num="169">The third embodiment of reference value setting scheme will now be described.</p>
    <p num="170">This embodiment contemplates permitting the reference value to be set to be a correct value of less error.</p>
    <p num="171">
      The position of the track TK on the magnetic tape 90 shifts (deviates) resulting from allowable (tolerable) positional error, etc. of the recording head on, e.g., the rotary drum of the recording device which has carried out such recording, and its error is allowed (tolerable) until  +- 26  MU m in the tape width direction.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since allowable (tolerable) error of the reproduction head on, e.g., the rotary drum exists also at the reproducing device side, it is necessary to take into consideration error of about  +- 50  MU m in total.
      <br/>
      Namely, in setting the reference value, shift of about  +- 50  MU m must be taken into consideration in terms of scanning distance must be taken into consideration as shift (deviation) of timing to be measured.
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      Moreover, in detection of timing, the problem of erroneous detection necessarily exists.
      <br/>
      Particularly, in such states that tracking deviates, there is the possibility that timing detection pulse TTP may be detected at positions except for the primary position PTTP.
      <br/>
      Further, in setting the reference value, as seen from the scanning shown in FIG. 14, scanning in the state where tracking deviates is frequently carried out, resulting in high possibility that erroneous detection of timing may take place.
      <br/>
      In such cases that timing detection pulse TTP has been detected at a position greatly spaced from the primary position PTTP, large error takes place in the reference value TB to be calculated.
      <br/>
      In view of the above, in this embodiment, an approach is employed to disregard timing detection pulse TTP erroneously detected in this way, thereby making it possible to set the reference value to a correct value of less error.
    </p>
    <p num="173">
      FIG. 25 is a flowchart showing the operation of the third embodiment of reference value setting scheme.
      <br/>
      Processing at steps F701, F704, F705 shown in FIG. 25 are respectively the same as those at the above-described steps F101, F103, F104 shown in FIG. 19. Here, explanation will be omitted in connection with the detail of those processing.
      <br/>
      Namely, the third embodiment is characterized in that window setting processing is carried out at the step F702 and the TTP interrupt processing within the step F703 is changed to some extent in correspondence therewith.
    </p>
    <p num="174">At the step F702, the arithmetic section 80 obtains approximately 3.about.30 tracking detection times between 1.about.2 frames with respect to respective azimuth tracks TKA, TKB to set window values W1.about.W4 on the basis of these tracking detection times.</p>
    <p num="175">In more practical sense, at step F801 of the flowchart shown in FIG. 26, the arithmetic section 80 takes thereinto three tracking detection times MTTP (x) or more in the recording area where respective azimuth tracks TKA, TKB exist.</p>
    <p num="176">
      At step F802, the arithmetic section 80 excludes the maximum value and the minimum value of the tracking detection times MTTP (x) thus taken in to determine an average value of the remaining tracking detection times MTTP (x) to set window.
      <br/>
      For example, a window value having width of about  +- 20  MU m in terms of scanning distance with its average value being as the center is set.
      <br/>
      Namely, as shown in FIG. 27, for example, the arithmetic section 80 takes thereinto three tracking detection times MTTP 1 or more measured on the basis of the timing detection pulse TTP detected from the position PTTP 1 in the recording area R1.
      <br/>
      These tracking detection times MTTP 1 are distributed with the scanning timing of the position PTTP 1 being as the center.
      <br/>
      Then, the arithmetic section 80 excludes tracking detection times MTTP 1 of the maximum value and the minimum value having high erroneous detection possibility in consideration of the possibility of erroneous detection to determine an average value of the remaining tracking detection times MTTP 1.
      <br/>
      This average value is a timing value substantially and precisely corresponding to the position PTTP 1.
      <br/>
      In view of the above, the arithmetic section 80 allows the range of  +- 20  MU m in terms of the scanning distance with its average value being as the center, i.e., the range from TW1 to TW2 shown in FIG. 27 in terms of timing to be window W1.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the arithmetic section 80 repeats processing of steps F801.about.F803 with respect to respective recording areas R2.about.R4 to set windows W2.about.W4 with respect to the respective recording areas R2.about.R4 as shown in FIG. 27. The arithmetic section 80 holds the windows W1.about.W4 set in this way into the window memory 87 shown in FIG. 17. The timing range TW3.about.TW4 of the window W2, the timing range TW5.about.TW6 of the window W3 and the timing range TW7.about.TW8 of the window W4 are respectively, e.g.,  +- 20  MU m in terms of the scanning distance with actual positions PTTP 2, PTTP 3, PTTP 4 being as the center.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that in addition to the method of respectively calculating windows W1.about.W4 with respect to respective recording areas R1.about.R4 as stated above, there may be employed, e.g., a method of setting window with respect to one recording area thereafter to set other windows by calculation by using standard time differences TLa.about.TLc, etc. with respect to other recording areas.
      <br/>
      When the windows W1.about.W4 are set in this way, the processing proceeds to step F703 shown in FIG. 25.
    </p>
    <p num="177">The processing of measurement of the tracking detection times and its accumulation at the step F703 is substantially the same as the processing in the above-described first embodiment of reference value setting scheme, but the TTP interrupt processing is different from the processing shown in FIG. 20 and is as indicated by the flowchart shown in FIG. 28. It is to be noted that processing at steps F901.about.F903, F905, F906 shown in FIG. 28 are respectively the same as the processing at the steps F201.about.F203, F204 and F205 shown in FIG. 20.</p>
    <p num="178">
      Namely, at step F902, the arithmetic section 80 determines time T2 in accordance with input of the timing detection pulse TTP.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, at step F903, the arithmetic section 80 compares the time T2 and window values W1.about.W4 to discriminate recording area to which that timing detection pulse TTP corresponds.
      <br/>
      However, since windows W1.about.W4 set as shown in FIG. 27, for example, are held in the window memory 87, there are instances where the time T2 does not correspond to any window.
      <br/>
      The case where the time T2 does not correspond to any window is the case where inputted timing detection pulse TTP is detected at timing considerably distant in point of time in practice from any one of timings of positions PTTP 1, PTTP 2, PTTP 3, PTTP 4.
      <br/>
      Namely, this is data having high possibility of erroneous detection and exerting bad influence on calculation of the reference value.
    </p>
    <p num="179">
      In view of the above, at step F904, the arithmetic section 80 judges whether or not corresponding window exists to complete the processing from the step F904 in the case where such window does not exist to employ an approach in which the timing detection pulse TTP at that time is not used for calculation of the reference value.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the arithmetic section 80 is operative so that in the case where the time T2 corresponds to a certain window, it allows or considers such window data to be suitable (reasonable) data corresponding to the certain recording area to carry out calculation of tracking detection time at the steps F905, F906.
    </p>
    <p num="180">
      As stated above, such an approach is employed to set the detection window to have a relatively narrow width to thereby exclude unsuitable timing detection pulse TTP to carry out reference value setting processing to thereby increase accuracy of the reference value, thus making it possible to carry out tracking servo control by more satisfactory timing ATF.
      <br/>
      Thus, even in the case of short time reference value setting using lesser number of tracking detection times, a high accuracy reference value can be obtained.
      <br/>
      As a result, the reference value setting processing can be quickly carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="181">It is to be noted that while, in this embodiment, the actual example for setting windows W1.about.W4 in correspondence with four recording areas has been described, this invention can be also applied to the case where the number of recording areas is set to value different from the above, and/or the case where timing detection pulse TTP is detected from single position without dividing the track into plural recording areas.</p>

      The servo circuit 30 having the timing ATF processing section 61 constituted as described above carries out, to some degree, reproduction operation for setting reference value prior to starting actual reproduction operation in order to set the reference value to carry out scanning of track in various tracking phase states as has been explained with reference to FIG. 4 to detect plural tracking detection times to determine an average value of these tracking detection times to determine the reference value on the basis of this average value.

      <br/>
      Thus, tracking detection times respectively corresponding to inclined tracks TKA, TKB in various tracking phase states are obtained.

      <br/>
      It is to be noted that the drum lead angle  THETA L at the time of tape traveling and that at the time when the tape is in stationary state are slightly different by the relative relationship between the magnetic tape and the rotary drum.
