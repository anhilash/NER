      A frequency-converting power supply is mounted on a power plug operable to be plugged into and held by an ordinary household electric power receptacle.
      <br/>
      Through an inductive internal impedance, the power supply provides a 20-40 kHz output voltage to a pair of output terminals that connect, by way of a female plug at the end of a light-weight power cord, with the input terminals of a fluorescent lamp assembly; across which input terminals is connected a capacitor of such capacitance value as to resonate with the power supply's inductive internal impedance, thereby providing the required lamp starting voltage and operating current.

      Also across the input terminals is connected a series-combination of a first instant-start fluorescent lamp and a special (normally shorted) female receptacle adapted to receive and disconnectably hold a special male plug; which, in turn, is connected with the terminals of a second instant-start fluorescent lamp.
      <br/>
      Thus, by way of disconnectable plug-receptacle means, one, two or more instant-start fluorescent lamps may be series-connected and properly started and operated from the frequency-converting plug-in power supply.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">Objects of the Invention</p>
    <p num="7">An object of the present invention is that of providing for a cost-effective gas discharge lighting system.</p>
    <p num="8">This as well as other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and claims.</p>
    <p num="9">Brief Description</p>
    <p num="10">
      The present invention is directed to providing improved inverter circuits for powering and controlling gas discharge lamps.
      <br/>
      The inverter circuits according to the present invention are highly efficient, can be compactly constructed and are ideally suited for energizing gas discharge lamps, particularly "instant-start" and "self-ballasted" fluorescent lamps.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      According to one form of the present invention, a series-connected combination of an inductor and a capacitor is provided in circuit with the inverter transistors to be energized upon periodic transistor conduction.
      <br/>
      Transistor drive current is preferably provided through the use of at least one saturable inductor to control the transistor inversion frequency to be equal to or greater than the nature resonant frequency of the inductor and capacitor combination.
      <br/>
      The high voltages efficiently developed by loading the inverter with the inductor and capacitor are ideally suited for energizing external loads such as gas discharge lamps.
      <br/>
      In such an application, the use of an adjustable inductor permits control of the inverter output as a means of adjusting the level of lamp illumination.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      According to another important form of the present invention, reliable and highly efficient half-bridge inverters include a saturable inductor in a current feedback circuit to drive the transistors for alternate conduction.
      <br/>
      The inverters also include a load having an inductance sufficient to effect periodic energy storage for self-sustained transistor inversion.
      <br/>
      Importantly, improved reliability is achieved because of the relatively low and transient-free voltages across the transistors in these half-bridge inverters.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Further, according to another feature of the present invention, novel and economical power supplies particularly useful with the disclosed inverter circuits convert conventional AC input voltages to DC for supplying to the inverters.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In a still different form, the present invention features a frequency-converting power supply mounted on a power plug operable to be plugged into and held by an ordinary household electric power receptacle.
      <br/>
      Through an inductive internal impedance, this power supply provides a 20-40 kHz output voltage to a pair of output terminals that connect, by way of a female plug at the end of a light-weight power cord, with the input terminals of a fluorescent lamp assembly; across which input terminals is connected a capacitor of such capacitance value as to resonate with the power supply's inductive internal impedance, thereby providing the required lamp starting voltage and operating current.
      <br/>
      Also across the input terminals is connected a series-combination of a first instant-start fluorescent lamp and a special (self-shorting) female receptacle means adapted to receive and disconnectably hold a special male plug; which, in turn, is connected with the terminals of a second instant-start fluorescent lamp.
      <br/>
      Thus, by way of disconnectable plug-receptacle means, one, two or more instant-start fluorescent lamps may be series-connected and properly started and operated from the frequency-converting plug-in power supply.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 1 illustrates a screw-in gas discharge lamp unit 10 comprising a folded fluorescent lamp 11 suitably secured to an integral base 12.
      <br/>
      The lamp comprises two cathodes 13, 14 which are supplied with the requisite high operating voltage from a frequency-converting power supply and ballasting circuit 16; which, because of its compact size, conveniently fits within the base 12.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The inverter circuit 16 is connected by leads 17, 18 to a screw-type plug 19 adapted for screw-in insertion into a standard Edison-type incandescent lamp socket at which ordinary 120 Volt/60 Hz power line voltage is available.
      <br/>
      A ground plane comprising a wire or metallic strip 21 is disposed adjacent a portion of the fluorescent lamp 11 as a starting aid.
      <br/>
      Finally, a manually rotatable external knob 22 is connected to a shaft for mechanical adjustment of the air gap of a ferrite core inductor to vary the inductance value thereof in order to effect adjustment of the inverter voltage output connected to electrodes 13, 14 for controlled variation of the lamp illumination intensity.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      With reference to FIG. 2, a power supply 23, connected to a conventional AC input, provides a DC output for supplying a high-efficiency inverter circuit 24.
      <br/>
      The inverter is operable to provide a high voltage to an external load 26, which may comprise a gas discharge device sich as the fluorescent lamp 11 of FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The power supply 23 comprises bridge rectifier having four diodes 27, 28, 29 and 31 connectable to a 240 volt AC supply at terminals 32, 33.
      <br/>
      Capacitors 34, 36 are connected between a ground line 37 (in turn directly connected to the inverter 24) and to a B+ line 38 and a B- line 39, respectively.
      <br/>
      The power supply 23 also comprises a voltage doubler and rectifier optionally connectable to a 120 volt AC input taken between the ground line 37 and terminal 33 Or 32.
      <br/>
      The voltage doubler and rectifier means provides a direct electrical connection by way of line 37 netween one of the 120 volt AC power input lines and the inverter 24, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The bridge rectifier and the voltage doubler and rectifier provide substantially the same DC output voltage to the inverter 24 whether the AC input is 120 or 240 volts.
      <br/>
      Typical voltages are +160 volts on the B+ line 38 and -160 volts on the B- line 39.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      With additional reference to FIG. 4, which shows an alternate power supply 23', the AC input, whether 120 or 240 volts, is provided at terminals 32' and 39.
      <br/>
      Terminal 39 is in turn connected through a single-pole double-throw selector switch 41 to terminal 37' (for 120 volt operation) or terminal 33' (for 240 volt operation).
      <br/>
      In all other respects, power supplies 23 and 23' are identical.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The inverter circuit 24 of FIG. 2 is a half-bridge inverter comprising transistors 42, 43 connected in series across the DC voltage output of the power supply 23 on B+ and B- lines 38 and 39, respectively.
      <br/>
      The collector of trasistor 42 is connected to the B+ line 38, the emitter of transistor 42 and the collector of transistor 43 are connected to a midpoint line 44 (designated "M") and the emitter of transistor 43 is connected to the B- line 39.
      <br/>
      The midpoint line 44 is in turn connected to the ground line 37 through primary winding 46 of a toroidal saturable core transformer 47, a primary winding 48 on an identical transformer 49, an inductor 51 and a series-connected capacitor 52.
      <br/>
      The inductor 51 and capacitor 52 are energized upon alternate transistor conduction in a manner to be described later.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      An external load 26 is preferably taken off capacitor 52, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The inductor 51, preferably a known ferrite core inductor, has an inductance variable by mechanical adjustment of the air gap in order to effect variation in the level of the inductor and capacitor voltage and hence the power available to the load, as will be described.
      <br/>
      When the load is a gas discharge lamp such as lamp 11 in FIG. 1, variation in this inductance upon rotation of knob 22 accomplishes a lamp dimming effect.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Drive current to the base terminals of transistors 42 and 43 is provided by secondary windings 53, 54 of transformers 49, 47, respectively.
      <br/>
      Winding 53 is also connected to midpoint lead 44 through a bias capacitor 56, while winding 54 is connected to the B- lead 39 through an identical bias capacitor 57.
      <br/>
      The base terminals of transistors 42 and 43 are also connected to lines 38 and 44 through bias resistors 58 and 59, respectively.
      <br/>
      For a purpose to be described later, the base of transistor 42 can be optionally connected to a diode 61 and a series Zener diode 64 in turn connected to the midpoint line 44; similarly, a diode 63 and series Zener diode 64 in turn connected to the B- line 39 can be connected to the base of transistor 43.
      <br/>
      Shunt diodes 66 and 67 are connected across the collector-emitter terminals of transistors 42 and 43, respectively.
      <br/>
      Finally, a capacitor 68 is connected across the collector-emitter terminals of transistor 43 to restrain the rate of voltage rise across those terminals, as will be seen presently.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The operation of the circuit of FIG. 2 can best be understood with additional reference to FIG. 3, which illustrates significant portions of the waveforms of the voltage at midpoint M (FIG. 3A), the base-emitter voltage on transistor 42 (FIG. 3B), the current through transistor 42 (FIG. 3C), and the capacitor 52 voltage and the inductor 51 current (FIG. 3D).</p>
    <p num="25">
      Assuming that transistor 42 is first to be triggered into conduction, current flows from the B+ line 38 through windings 46 and 38 and the inductor 51 to charge capacitor 52 and returns through capacitor 34 (refer to the time period designated I in FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      When the saturable inductor 49 saturates at the end of period I, drive current to the base of transistor 42 will terminate, causing voltage on the base of the transistor to drop to the negative voltage stored on the bias capacitor 56 in a manner to be described, causing this transistor to become non-conductive.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3c, current-flow in transistor 43 terminates at the end of period I.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Because the current through inductor 51 cannot change instantaneously, current will flow from the B- bus 39 through capacitor 68, causing the voltage at midpoint line 44 to drop to -160 volts (period II in FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      The capacitor 68 restrains the rate of voltage change across the collector and emitter terminals of transistor 42.
      <br/>
      The current through the inductor 51 reaches its maximum value when the voltage at the midpoint line 44 is zero.
      <br/>
      During period III, the current will continue to flow through inductor 51 but will be supplied from the B-bus through the shunt diode 67.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that during the latter half of period II and all of period III, positive current is being drawn from a negative voltage; which, in reality, means that energy is being returned to the power supply through a path of relatively low impedance.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      When the inductor current reaches zero at the start of period IV, the current through the primary winding 46 of the saturable inductor 47 will cause a current to flow out of its secondary winding 54 to cause transistor 43 to become conductive, thereby causing a reversal in the direction of current through inductor 51 and capacitor 52.
      <br/>
      When transformer 47 saturates at the end of period IV, the drive current to the base of transistor 43 terminates and the current through inductor 51 will be supplied through capacitor 68, causing the voltage at midpoint line 44 to rise (period V).
      <br/>
      When the voltage at the midpoint line M reaches 160 volts, the current will then flow through shunt diode 66 (period VI).
      <br/>
      The cycle is then repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As seen in FIG. 3, saturable transformers 47, 49 provide transistor drive current only after the current through inductor 51 has diminished to zero.
      <br/>
      Further, the transistor drive current is terminated before the current through inductor 51 has reached its maximum amplitude.
      <br/>
      This coordination of base drive current and inductor current is achieved because of the series-connection between the inductor 51 and the primary windings 46, 48 of saturable transformers 47, 49, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The series-connected combination of the inductor 51 and the capacitor 52 is energized upon the alternate conduction of transistors 42 and 43.
      <br/>
      With a large value of capacitance of capacitor 52, very little voltage will be developed across its terminals.
      <br/>
      As the value of this capacitance is decreased, however, the voltage across this capacitor will increase.
      <br/>
      As the value of the capacitor 52 is reduced to achieve resonance with the inductor 51, the voltage on the capacitor will rise and become infinite in a loss-free circuit operating under ideal conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      It has been found desirable to regulate the transistor inversion frequency, determined mainly by the saturation time of the saturable inductors 47, 49, to be equel to or higher than the natural resonance frequency of the inductor and capacitor combination in order to provide a high voltage output to external load 26.
      <br/>
      A high voltage across capacitor 52 is efficiently developed as the transistor inversion frequency approaches the natural resonant frequency of the inductor 51 and capacitor 52 combination.
      <br/>
      Stated another way, the conduction period of each transistor is desirably shorter in duration than one quarter of the full period corresponding to the natural resonant frequency of the inductor and capacitor combination.
      <br/>
      When the inverter 24 is used with a self-ballasted gas discharge lamp unit, it has been found that the inversion frequency can be at least equal to the natural resonant frequency of the tank circuit.
      <br/>
      If the capacitance value of capacitor 52 is reduced still further beyond the resonance point, unacceptably high transistor currents will be experienced during transistor switching and transistor burn-out will occur.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      It will be appreciated that the sizing of capacitor 52 is determined by the application of the inverter circuit 24.
      <br/>
      Variation in the values of the capacitor 52 and the inductor 51 will determine the voltages developed in the inductor-capacitor tank circuit.
      <br/>
      The external load 26 may be connected in circuit with the inductor 51 (by a winding on the inductor, for example) and the capacitor may be omitted entirely.
      <br/>
      If the combined circuit loading of the inductor 51 and the external load 26 has an effective inductance of value sufficient to effect periodic energy storage for self-sustained transistor inversion, the current feedback provided by the saturable inductors 47,49 will effect alternate transistor conduction without the need for additional voltage feedback.
      <br/>
      When the capacitor 52 is omitted, the power supply 23 provides a direct electrical connection between one of the AC power input lines and the inverter load circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Because the voltages across transistors 42, 43 are relatively low (due to the effect of capacitors 34, 36), the half-bridge inverter 24 is very reliable.
      <br/>
      The absence of switching transients minimizes the possibility of transistor burn-out.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The inverter circuit 24 comprises means for supplying reverse bias to the conducting transistor upon saturation of its associated saturable inductor.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, the capacitors 56 and 57 are charged to negative voltages as a result of reset current flowing into secondary windings 53, 54 from the bases of transistors 42, 43, respectively.
      <br/>
      This reverse current rapidly turns off a conducting transistor to increase its switching speed and to achieve inverter circuit efficiency in a manner described more fully in my co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 103,624 filed Dec. 14, 1979 and entitled "Bias Control for High Efficiency Inverter Circuit" (now U.S. Pat. No. 4,307,353).
      <br/>
      The more negative the voltage on the bias capacitors 56 and 57, the more rapidly charges are swept out of the bases of their associated transistors upon transistor turn-off.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      When a transistor base-emitter junction is reversely biased, it exhibits the characteristics of a Zener diode having a reverse breakdown voltage on the order of 8 to 14 Volt for transistors typically used in high-voltage inverters.
      <br/>
      As an alternative, to provide a negative voltage smaller in magnitude on the base lead of typical transistor 42 during reset operation, the optional diode 61 and Zener diode 62 combination can be used.
      <br/>
      For large values of the bias capacitor 56, the base voltage will be substantially constant.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      If the load 26 comprises a gas discharge lamp, the voltage across the capacitor 52 will be reduced once the lamp is ignited to prevent voltages on the inductor 51 and the capacitor 52 from reaching destructive levels.
      <br/>
      Such a lamp provides an initial time delay during which a high voltage, suitable for instant starting, is available.
    </p>

      The combination of lamp 71 and capacitor 74 is connected in parallel with a capacitor 52' which serves the same purpose as capacitor 52 in the FIG. 2 circuit.
      <br/>
      However, when the load 26' is unplugged from the circuit, the inverter stops oscillating and the development of high voltages in the inverter is prevented.
      <br/>
      The fact that no high voltages are generated by the circuit if the lamp is disconnected while the circuit is oscillating is important for safety reasons.

      FIG. 6 illustrates a capacitor 52" connected in series with an inductor 51" through a heater 81 suitable for heating the toroidal inductors 47, 49 in accordance with the level of output.
      <br/>
      The load 26" is connected across the series combination of the capacitor 52" and the toroid heater.
      <br/>
      The heater 81 is preferably designed to controllably heat the toroidal saturable inductors in order to decrease their saturation flux limit and hence their saturation time.
      <br/>
      The result is to decrease the periodic transistor conduction time and thereby increase the transistor inversion frequency.
      <br/>
      When a frequency-dependent impedance means, that is, an inductor or a capacitor, is connected in circuit with the AC voltage output of the inverter, change in the transistor inversion frequency will modify the impedance of the frequency-dependent impedance means and correspondingly modify the inverter output.
      <br/>
      Thus as the level of the output increases, the toroid heater 81 is correspondingly energized to effect feedback regulation of the output.
      <br/>
      Further, transistors 42, 43 of the type used in high voltage inverters dissipate heat during periodic transistor conduction.
      <br/>
      As an alternative, the toroid heater 81 can use this heat for feedback regulation of the output or control of the temperature of transistors 42, 43.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The frequency dependent impedance means may also be used in a circuit to energize a gas discharge lamp at adjustable illumination levels.
      <br/>
      Adjustment in the inversion frequency of transistors 42, 43 results in control of the magnitude of the AC current supplied to the lamp.
      <br/>
      This is preferably accomplished where saturable inductors 47, 49 have adjustable flux densities for control of their saturation time.

      Disconnectably connected with output terminals 204, 205 is a pair of power conductors 206, 207; which power conductor 207 has a switch 208.

      A first lamp assembly 209 has a pair of power input terminals 210, 211; which power input terminals are disconnectably connected with power conductors 206, 207.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Within lamp assembly 209, a capacitor 212 is connected directly across terminals 210, 211; which terminal 211 is connected directly with terminal 213 of a special combination switch and receptacle means 214; which switch/receptacle means 214 also has a second terminal 215.
      <br/>
      An instant-start fluorescent lamp 216 is connected between terminals 210 and 215.

      Switch/receptable means 214 is of such nature as to provide for an electrical short circuit to exist between its terminals 213, 215, except when a special plug 217 is inserted into it (as shown).
      <br/>
      Special plug 217, which is connected with a second lamp assembly 220, has two terminals 218, 219; which terminal 219 is connected with a terminal 221 of another special combination switch and receptacle means 222.

      Switch/receptacle means 222 also has a terminal 223; and an instant-start fluorescent lamp 224 is connected between terminals 218 and 223.

      Like switch/receptacle means 214, switch/receptacle means 222 is of such nature as to provide for an electrical short circuit to exist between its terminals 221, 223, except when a special plug--like special plug 217--is inserted thereinto.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      With switch 208 in its closed position, the pair of power conductors 206, 207, when connected with the first lamp assembly 209 (combined with any and all additional lamp assemblies plugged into its switch/receptacle means 214), represents the load for the frequency-converting power supply 203, just like load 26' of FIG. 5 represents the load on an inverter circuit like that of FIG. 2 with capacitor 52 and load 26 removed.
      <br/>
      That is, the frequency-converting power supply 203 is substantially identical to the circuit arrangement of FIG. 1, except with tank capacitor 52 and load 26 removed.
      <br/>
      Also, terminals 37 and 33 of FIG. 2 would be equivalent to terminals 201 and 202 of FIG. 9.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      With switch 208 closed, a tank inductor within frequency-converting power supply 203 (i.e., a tank inductor equivalent to inductor 51 of FIG. 2) resonates with the capacitance of capacitor 212, thereby--due to so-called Q-multiplication--causing a high-magnitude high-frequency voltage to develop across tank capacitor 212.
      <br/>
      Eventually, the magnitude of this high-frequency voltage reaches a level sufficient to ignite series-connected lamps 216 and 224 (as well as any additional series-connected lamps).
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Thus, with a sufficiently high circuit Q-factor, the magnitude of the high-frequency voltage across tank capacitor 212 will increase to whatever point is required to cause the lamps to ignite.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the lamps will be powered with a current of magnitude determined by the particular value of the inductance included within frequency-converting power supply 203 (i.e., its internal inductive impedance) as combined with the particular value of the capacitance of tank capacitor 212.
    </p>
    <p num="54">Of course, with switch 208 in its open position, the inverter within the frequency-converting power supply 203 is prevented from operating.</p>
    <p num="55">
      If, while the lamps are both operating, lamp assembly 224 were to be unplugged from switch/receptacle means 214 on lamp assembly 209, lamp 224 would extinguish, but lamp 216 would continue to be lit.
      <br/>
      In fact, due to the basic nature of the parallel-loaded series-excited inverter--which is what the half-bridge inverter circuit of FIG. 2 actually represents--the magnitude of the current supplied to lamp 216 changes very little with the removal of (or with the addition of) lamp 224.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Thus, with the arrangement of FIG. 9, any number (up to some maximum number) of lamp assemblies may be plugged into each other and be properly ignitied and operated: the maximum permissible number depending on particulatr design details.
      <br/>
      For instance, using 12" T-5 fluorescent lamps, a total of twelve series-connected lamps can readily be ignited and properly powered from a single frequency-converting power supply small enough to be built in integral combination with a power plug suitable for direct plug-in connection into and support by an ordinary household electric receptacle.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      FIG. 10 illustrates an example of an application of the lighting system of FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 10, the frequency-converting power supply 203 of FIG. 9 is built into an over-sized power plug 230, which is plugged into and held by household electric receptacle 231 mounted on a wall in a kitchen between a counter-top and some kitchen cabinets.
      <br/>
      Plugged into over-sized power plug 230 is a small power plug 232; which, via power cord 233 (which includes power conductors 206, 207 as well as switch 208) and female plug means 234, is plugged into first lamp assembly 209; which is mounted under the kitchen cabinets.
      <br/>
      Second lamp assembly 220 is plugged into switch/receptacle means 214 by way of a connect cord 235; and a third lamp assembly 236 is plugged into lamp assembly 209 by way of a connect cord 237.
    </p>
    <p num="58">The first lamp assembly 209, which is the only one of the plural lamp assemblies which includes the tank capacitor, may sometimes hereinafter be referred-to as the master lamp assembly.</p>
    <p num="59">Additional Explanations and Comments</p>
    <p num="60">(a) With reference to FIGS. 2 and 5, adjustment of the amount of power supplied to load 26', and thereby the amount of light provided by lamp 71, may be accomplished by applying a voltage of adjustable magnitude to input terminals IP1 and IP2 of the Toroid Heater; which is thermally coupled with the toroidal ferrite cores of saturable transformers 47, 49.</p>
    <p num="61">
      (b) With reference to FIGS. 9 and 10, each switch/receptacle means (such as element 214) is characterized by providing for a short circuit between its terminals (i.e., 213, 215) except if or when a special plug (i.e., one such as plug 217) is inserted into this switch/receptacle means such as to pry apart two spring-loaded conductive elements comprised therewithin.
      <br/>
      Thus, each time one lamp assembly (such as lamp assembly 220) is plugged into another lamp assembly (such as lamp assembly 209), the fluorescent lamp of the first lamp assembly (i.e., lamp 224) becomes series-connected with the fluorescent lamp of the second lamp assembly (i.e., lamp 216).
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      (c) With commonly available components, inverter circuit 24 of FIG. 2 can be made to operate efficiently at any frequency between a few kHz to perhaps as high as 50 kHz.
      <br/>
      However, for various well-known reasons (i.e., eliminating audible noise, minimizing physical size, and maximizing efficiency), the frequency actually chosen is in the range of 20 to 40 kHz.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      (d) The fluorescent lighting unit of FIG. 1 could be made in such manner as to permit fluorescent lamp 11 to be disconnectable from its base 12 and ballasting means 16.
      <br/>
      However, if powered with normal line voltage without its lamp load connected, frequency-converting power supply and ballasting circuit 16 is apt to self-destruct.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      To avoid such self-destruction, arrangements can readily be made whereby the very act of removing the load automatically establishes a situation that prevents the possible destruction of the power supply and ballasting means.
      <br/>
      For instance, with the tank capacitor (52) being permanently connected with the lamp load (11)--thereby automatically being removed whenever the lamp is removed--the inverter circuit is protected from self-destruction.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      (e) At frequencies above a few kHz, the load represented by a fluorescent lamp--once it is ignited--is substantially resistive.
      <br/>
      Thus, with the voltage across lamp 11 being of a substantially sinusoidal waveform (as indicated in FIG. 3d), the current through the lamp will also be substantially sinusoidal in waveshape.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      (f) In the fluorescent lamp unit of FIG. 1, fluorescent lamp 11 is connected with power supply and ballasting circuit. 16 in the exact same manner as is load 26 connected with the circuit of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      That is, it is connected in parallel with the tank capacitor (52) of the L-C series-resonant circuit.
      <br/>
      As is conventional in instant-start fluorescent lamps--such as lamp 11 of FIG. 1--the two terminals from each cathode are shorted together, thereby to constitute a situation where each cathode effectively is represented by only a single terminal.
      <br/>
      However, it is not necessary that the two terminals from each cathode be shorted together; in which case--for instant-start operation--connection from a lamp's power supply and ballasting means need only be made with one of the terminals of each cathode.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      (g) With respect to FIGS. 9 and 10, in any of the plural lamp assemblies (such as lamp assembly 209), the fluorescent lamp (ex: lamp 216) may in fact consist of two or more series-connected instant-start lamps.
      <br/>
      Thus, a lamp assembly may be configured in any one of a variety of ways: as a single straight fluorescent lamp; as plural parallel-placed (but electrically series-connected) straight fluorescent lamps; as U-bent or circular fluorescent lamps; etc.
      <br/>
      That is to say: the lamp assemblies may be provided in the form of lighting strips, lighting panels, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      (h) Again with respect to FIGS. 9 and 10, if a lamp assembly is arranged to include plural individual fluorescent lamps, it is anticipated that a simple shorting-switch means be provided whereby one or more of the plural lamps may be shorted.
      <br/>
      That way, light output control may be achieve in a very simple and cost-effective manner.
    </p>
    <p num="69">(i) It is thought that the present invention and many of its attendant advantages will be understood from the foregoing description and that many changes may be made in the form and construction of its components parts, the form described being merely a preferred embodiment of the invention.</p>
