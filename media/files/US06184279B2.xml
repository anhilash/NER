    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to coating compositions with at least one curable film forming resin that result in cured coating films on substrates having good appearance from reduced defects like popping or gassing while allowing for a reduced tendency to discolor.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Various coating compositions involve curing of the film forming resins of the coating in a variety of ways ranging from self curing through evaporation of a carrier or solvent or reaction by such environmental factors like atmospheric water vapor to curing through the presence of one or more curing agents in the coating composition.
      <br/>
      The latter can be radiation curing like ultraviolet light curing and/or addition of crosslinking agents to crosslink with the film forming resin.
      <br/>
      With many of the aforementioned curing mechanisms or from application methods, the potential may exist for the latent evolution of gas, vapor or air during the curing of the coating.
      <br/>
      For instance with powder type coating compositions the spraying of the powder can result in entrapped air in the formed coating that could not adequately escape before curing.
      <br/>
      Such evolution can result in defects of the cured film from the gassing or popping or release of such gas, vapor and/or air.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      For some powder coatings, several U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,801,680; 5,461,089; 5,635,548 and 5,248,400 (Franks, et al.) have disclosed the use of benzoin as an additive or modifier.
      <br/>
      The art has indicated that in some powder coatings the benzoin performs a degassing or antipopping or air release function, when used in an amount from 0.5 to 3 weight percent.
      <br/>
      Several patent documents have noted a discoloration problem particularly in hydroxyalkylamide cured polyester powder systems when benzoin is used as a degassing agent.
      <br/>
      Discoveries were made that wax type and thermoplastic polymer type degassing agents in U.S. Pat. No. 5,342,893 (Wilkinson, et al.) and EP 0471409 (DSM) gave reduced discoloration when used in place of benzoin.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Solid particulate coating formulations referred to in the industry as "powder coatings" are finding increasing use in painting metal substrates both as primer coatings and as top or clear coats of the base coat and clear coat composite coatings.
      <br/>
      The automotive industry provides corrosion protection and decorative appearance for motor vehicles by multilayered coating or paint composites on the various types of surfaces of motor vehicles.
      <br/>
      The finishing layers of this composite usually include the popular base coat clear coat composites.
      <br/>
      The base coat is a pigmented layer and the clear coat is a nonpigmented or only slightly pigmented layer that is applied separately to the base coat and cured to some degree with the base coat.
      <br/>
      To provide improved coating composites for motor vehicles, the industry continuously seeks improvements from an environmental standpoint without sacrificing surface appearance and/or performance properties.
      <br/>
      Using powder coating compositions as clear coats as well as for other coating layers in multilayered composite coatings would provide an environmentally acceptable coating composition.
      <br/>
      The powder clear coats are becoming more widely used for their advantages in application from their lower organic solvent emissions.
      <br/>
      These coatings typically have very low levels of volatile solvents, i.e., on the order of two percent or slightly higher but generally much less than other paint systems.
      <br/>
      Such compositions serving as solutions of environmental acceptable technology can not increase problems such as surface appearance defects like popping, gassing and the like and increased likelihood of non-compensatible discoloration of the coating.
    </p>
    <p num="5">An object of the present invention is to provide liquid and/or powder coating compositions with one or more curable resins or polymers that result in cured coatings having reduced appearance or surface defects from air, gas or solvent release from the coating while curing and particularly while also resulting in a cured coating with reduced yellowing.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">In accordance with the present invention, coating compositions have at least one liquid or particulate curable film forming resinous material, and an effective degassing amount of a material having the structure:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="7">
      wherein R and R' are the same or different groups of primary alkyl groups with 1 to 6 carbon atoms including methyl groups or an aromatic group containing one or more heteroatoms either internal or external to the aromatic ring and dimer derivatives of Structure I compounds.
      <br/>
      The effective amount for degassing is usually in the range from about 0.01 to about 5 percent by weight based on the weight of total resin solids of the coating composition.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      When the curable coating composition with the curable film-forming resinous material and the material of Structure I and/or dimers thereof is a liquid, a carrier may be used.
      <br/>
      The carrier can make the coating composition a solvent-borne or water-borne coating composition.
      <br/>
      Also, other additional components usually found in curable coating compositions can be present in amounts usually used by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For chemical curing through crosslinking of a crosslinking agent with the curable film forming resinous material an appropriate crosslinking agent is present in the coating composition for crosslinking reaction with the resinous material.
      <br/>
      These amounts of the other additional components and film-forming resinous material provide most of the solids for the coating composition producing a cured coating.
      <br/>
      Also the liquid or powder coating composition of the present invention can be used as a single coating layer in coating substrates such as appliances and the like or as a coating layer in a multiple coating composite.
      <br/>
      Examples of the latter include those coating composites used in motor vehicle manufacturing and refinish coating operations which can include: liquid or powder primer coatings, primer surfacer coatings, pigmented or unpigmented formulations as well as pigmented formulations as the basecoat or in unpigmented formulations as the clearcoat in basecoat or colorcoat and clearcoat composite coatings.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">In the following description of the specification and claims unless otherwise expressly indicated to the contrary the following terms have the indicated meanings.</p>
    <p num="10">
      The use of numerical values in ranges for temperature, pressure, pH, and amounts of and molecular weight values of materials, whether number average molecular weight ("Mn") or weight average molecular weight ("Mw"), amounts expressed in equivalents and equivalent ratios, and other reaction and operational conditions are stated as approximations as though the minimum and maximum values within the stated ranges were both preceded by the word "about".
      <br/>
      In this manner small variations above and below, the stated ranges can be used to achieve substantially the same results as values within the ranges.
      <br/>
      Also, the disclosure of these ranges is intended as a continuous range including every value between the minimum and maximum values.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Also for molecular weights whether Mn or Mw, these quantities are those determinable from gel permeation chromatography using polystyrene as standards as is well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      An example is that discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,739,019 at column 4, lines 2-45.
      <br/>
      For this reference to a U.S. patent and for other references to issued U.S. patents and published patent applications in the following disclosure for the specifically stated information therein, that information is considered as incorporated by reference herein.
    </p>
    <p num="12">By the term "film-forming", it is meant that an at least near continuous film, except perhaps for a few if any pin hole type marks, can be formed on at least a horizontal surface from either 1) the particulate polymeric material of a powder coating upon at least melting and curing at elevated temperature, or 2) the polymeric material dispersed or solubilized in a solvent or carrier upon drying or evaporation of the solvent or carrier and/or curing of the polymeric material.</p>
    <p num="13">Also by the term "powder", it is meant a particulate, finely divided solid polymeric material generally having a particle size of 0.005 to 100 microns.</p>
    <p num="14">
      The term "epoxy content" refers to a determination through the epoxide equivalent weight in non-aqueous resins and their solutions by differential titration with perchloric acid using crystal violet as an indicator.
      <br/>
      An epoxy-containing sample is dissolved in glacial acetic acid and titrated against a standard solution of (0.1N) perchloric acid in glacial acetic acid in the presence of tetraethylammonium bromide, using crystal violet as indicator.
      <br/>
      This potentiometric titration with perchloric acid determines the base content of the polyepoxide.
      <br/>
      The mass in grams of sample containing one mole of unreacted epoxide functionality is determined by reaction of the epoxide with hydrobromic acid.
      <br/>
      The hydrobromic acid is generated in situ by the reaction of tetraethylammonium bromide with perchloric acid.
      <br/>
      A second sample of the polyepoxide is mixed with excess tetraethylammonium bromide and titrated with 0.1N perchloric acid to a green endpoint that persists for at least 30 seconds, and total epoxide and amine equivalents are calculated from these titrations, and the epoxide equivalent weight is calculated as the difference.
      <br/>
      The epoxy content is the epoxy equivalent weight divided by the molecular weight of the polyepoxide sample.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The curable liquid or solid film-forming resinous material of the coating composition of the present invention may be any of the polymers known to those skilled in the art to be useful in curable coating compositions including solvent-borne, water-borne, and powder coatings.
      <br/>
      The water-borne coatings include those that are water-dilutable, where binders are either molecular dispersed solutions in water or water/solvent blends or binders in the form of dispersions or emulsions.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      One suitable class of polymer for the film-forming resinous material includes those which are derived from one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers.
      <br/>
      Particularly useful members of this class are the acrylic polymers which are well established for the production of coatings in the automobile industry, such as polymers or copolymers of one or more alkyl esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, optionally together with other ethylenically unsaturated monomers.
      <br/>
      These polymers are thermosetting and crosslinking.
      <br/>
      Suitable acrylic or methacrylic esters for this type of polymer include: ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, tert-butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, n-butyl methacrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, tert-butyl methacrylate, isobornyl methacrylate, isodecyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, and so forth and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Cyclic esters such as cyclohexyl acrylate and cyclohexyl methacrylate, benzyl acrylate and/or methacrylate, as well as hydroxyalkyl esters such as 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate or methacrylate, and hydroxybutyl acrylate and methacrylate may also be used.
      <br/>
      In addition, vinyl aliphatic or vinyl aromatic compounds other than alpha-methyl styrene dimer which is considered a chain transfer agent, such as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, styrene, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate and vinyl toluene can be used.
      <br/>
      The aforelisted acrylic ester monomers are hereinafter referred to as "Acrylic Ester Monomers".
      <br/>
      For crosslinking, suitable functional monomers to be used in addition to the aforementioned include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, N-(alkoxymethyl)acrylamides and N-(alkoxymethyl)methacrylamides, where the alkoxy group may be, for example, a butoxy group, glycidyl acrylate, and/or glycidyl methacrylate.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Other suitable classes of polymers useful as the curable film-forming resinous material are: polyepoxides, acrylosilane polymers, acrylic polyol polymers, and, polyisocyanates.</p>
    <p num="18">
      In the curable coating composition of the present invention, the aforedescribed film-forming resinous materials are capable of film formation at least with crosslinking.
      <br/>
      Crosslinking can be through one or more designated film forming resinous materials with one or more crosslinking agent(s).
      <br/>
      For the film-forming resinous materials with crosslinking agents as the additional polymeric material or with two polymeric materials that are reactive with each other, the additional polymeric material and/or the inter-reactivity of both polymers result in crosslinking.
      <br/>
      For a polyepoxide film forming resinous material a polyacid material can be the crosslinking agent especially where as the preferred film forming resinous material the polyepoxide is the major film forming component of the coating.
      <br/>
      For the acrylosilane polymer film-forming resinous material, the acrylic polyol polymer can be the crosslinking agent.
      <br/>
      Although in this case, these polymeric materials have functionality so that one reacts to form crosslinks with the other along with any alkylated melamine-formaldehyde crosslinking agent.
      <br/>
      This occurs in a similar manner in the film-forming resinous material of polyisocyanate and a polymer having at least one group that is reactive with isocyanate.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      For the aforementioned film-forming resinous materials any of the polymers and their crosslinkers can be any of those known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Non-exclusive examples include U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,650,718 (Simpson, et al.) (column 1, line 61 through column 3, line 40 and column 4, line 55 through column 9, line 15); U.S. Pat. No. 4,102,942 (column 3, lines 1-16); U.S. Pat. No. 4,798,745 (Martz, et al.) (column 2, line 66 through column 9, line 8); U.S. Pat. No. 4,699,814 (Ambrose, et al.) (column 4, line 10 through column 6, line 51); U.S. Pat. No. 3,567,692 (Haggis, et al.) (for all that it teaches about polymeric film forming materials); U.S. Pat. No. 4,681,811 (Simpson, et al.) (column 1, line 63 through column 10, line 65); and Canadian patent document No. 1,262,596 (for all that it teaches about polymeric film forming materials).
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The acrylic polymers or copolymers can be used that are of one or more of the Acrylic Ester Monomers prepared via aqueous emulsion polymerization techniques and used directly in the preparation of aqueous coating compositions, or prepared via organic solution polymerization techniques with groups capable of salt formation such as acid or amine groups.
      <br/>
      Upon neutralization of these groups with a base or an acid, the polymers can be dispersed into aqueous medium.
      <br/>
      Generally, any method of producing such polymers that is known to those skilled in the art utilizing art-recognized amounts of monomers can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Suitable functional monomers may be used in addition to the other acrylic monomers mentioned above for crosslinking purposes and include, for example, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, hydroxyalkyl acrylates, and hydroxyalkyl methacrylates.
      <br/>
      Also, the acrylic polymer can be prepared with N-(alkoxymethyl)acrylamides and N-(alkoxymethyl)methacrylamides.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Besides acrylic polymers, the polymeric film-forming resin for the water borne coating composition may be an alkyd resin or a polyester.
      <br/>
      Such polymers may be prepared in a known manner by condensation of polyhydric alcohols and polycarboxylic acids.
      <br/>
      Suitable polyhydric alcohols include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, 1,6-hexylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylol propane, 1,4-cyclo-hexanedimethanol and pentaerythritol.
      <br/>
      Suitable polycarboxylic acids are known to those skilled in the art and include succinic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, phthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid, and trimellitic acid.
      <br/>
      Besides the polycarboxylic acids mentioned above, functional equivalents of the acids such as anhydrides where they exist or lower alkyl esters of the acids such as the methyl esters may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Where it is desired to produce air-drying alkyd resins, suitable drying oil fatty acids may be used and include those derived from linseed oil, soya bean oil, tall oil, dehydrated castor oil, or tung oil and the like.</p>
    <p num="24">The polyesters and the alkyd resins can contain a portion of free hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups which are available for further crosslinking reactions.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Also polyurethanes can be used as the film-forming resinous material in the coating composition.
      <br/>
      Among the polyurethanes which can be used are polymeric polyols which are prepared by reacting the polyester polyols or acrylic polyols such as those mentioned above with a polyisocyanate such that the OH/NCO equivalent ratio is greater than 1:1 so that free hydroxyl groups are present in the product.
      <br/>
      The organic polyisocyanate which is used to prepare the polyurethane polyol can be an aliphatic or an aromatic polyisocyanate or a mixture of the two.
      <br/>
      Diisocyanates are more suitable, although higher polyisocyanates can be used in place of or in combination with diisocyanates.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable aromatic diisocyanates are 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and toluene diisocyanate.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable aliphatic diisocyanates are straight chain aliphatic diisocyanates such as 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate.
      <br/>
      Also, cycloaliphatic diisocyanates can be employed.
      <br/>
      Examples include isophorone diisocyanate and 4,4'-methylene-bis-(cyclohexyl isocyanate).
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable higher polyisocyanates are 1,2,4-benzene triisocyanate and polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The polyester and polyurethane may be prepared with unreacted carboxylic acid groups, which upon neutralization with bases such as amines, allows for dispersion into aqueous medium for use in a water-borne coating composition.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable basecoat compositions include the water-borne compositions disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,403,003, (column 2, line 3 through column 13 line 12).
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      A suitable liquid film-forming resinous material is an epoxy-acid material when the coating composition is a clearcoat composition of a basecoat/clearcoat composite coating.
      <br/>
      The multi-package and single-package liquid compositions disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,256,452 at columns 1-25 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,650,718 at columns 1-16, are suitable compositions.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The coating composition can have in addition to the film-forming resinous material one or more crosslinking agents.
      <br/>
      Of course, the crosslinking agents are somewhat specific depending on the film forming resinous material that is present in the composition since the two materials interact in crosslinking.
      <br/>
      In addition to the above-named crosslinking agents for specific types of resinous materials, i.e. polyacid crosslinking agent for a polyepoxide, acrylic polyol polymer or acrylosilane polymer for the other, and polymer having at least one group that is reactive with isocyanate for polyisocyanate, other crosslinking agents may be used.
      <br/>
      For the resinous materials with which they can crosslink, these include: diisocyanate, diepoxide or, a nitrogen resin, like a condensate of formaldehyde with a nitrogenous compound such as urea, thiourea, melamine or benzoguanamine, or a lower alkyl ether of such a condensate in which the alkyl group contains from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, typically referred to as an aminoplast.
      <br/>
      Such crosslinking agents are melamine-formaldehyde condensates in which a substantial proportion of the methylol groups have been etherified by reaction with butanol or alcohols like ethanol or methanol.
      <br/>
      Any of these crosslinking agents known to those skilled in the art for use with curable acrylic polymers may be used.

      When the powder coating composition is to give a transparent or clear topcoat layer used in a "color-plus-clear" composite coating as opposed to a powder primer composition, a particularly preferred powder coating composition is one with a mixture of a polyepoxide and a polyacid crosslinking agent.

      With the preferred powder coating, the weight percent is of the total resins of the coating composition.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the flow control copolymer will be included in the powder coating composition in amounts of 0.1 to 3 percent by weight, more preferably from about 0.5 to about 2 percent by weight for clear coat applications.
      <br/>
      The preferred flow modifier is that shown in the examples.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The coating compositions of the invention can optionally include other materials such as pigments, fillers, catalysts like organic peroxides and azo-type compounds, chain transfer agents, light stabilizers, flow control or modifying agents, additional film forming polymers, and antioxidants such as those shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,407,707. Nonexclusive examples of light stabilizers include those shown in the Examples herein, like (2-tert-butyl-2-(4-hydroxy-3,5-di-tert-butylbenzyl)�bis(methyl-2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl)�dipropionate) and (2-(3',5'-bis(1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)-2'-hydroxyphenyl)benzotriazole) and others such as CGL 1545 hydroxyphenyl triazine ultraviolet absorber available from Ciba-Geigy Limited, Basel, Switzerland.
      <br/>
      Also useful are anti-yellowing agents like 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide, or 3,4,5,6-dibenzo-1,2-oxaphosphane-2-oxide as a white crystalline powder with a specific gravity of 1.40 at 30 (degree)  C., and a melting point of 118 (degree)  C. and a boiling point of about 200 (degree)  C. at 5 mm Hg., and fatty acid amide including ethylene bis-stearoylamide.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Although the powder coating composition is preferably a clear coat for a base coat and clear coat composite, one or more pigments can be included in the coating composition.
      <br/>
      Their amounts would range from 1 to 50 percent by weight based on total weight of the composition if color is desired for the resultant coating.
      <br/>
      Suitable pigments include, for example, inorganic pigments including: titanium dioxide, iron oxide, chromium oxide, lead chromate, and barium sulfate, and organic pigments including, ultramarine blue, phthalocyanine blue, phthalocyanine green, carbon black, graphite fibrils, and quindo red.
      <br/>
      When the powder coating is applied under a basecoat layer the pigment can be included in the coating composition in amounts of up to 16, preferably 1.0 to 10 percent by weight based on total weight of the coating composition in order to give a suitable color to the resultant coating.
      <br/>
      When the thermosetting powder coating is a layer in a multilayered coating composite beneath at least one layer such as a topcoat layer, such pigment additives may be excluded and pigments may instead be incorporated into a topcoat layer.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      In addition, the powder coating composition may include fumed silica or the like to reduce caking of the powder during storage.
      <br/>
      An example of a fumed silica is sold by Cabot Corporation under the trademark CAB-O-SIL.
      <br/>
      The fumed silica is present in amounts ranging from 0.1 to 1 percent by weight based on total weight of the powder coating formulation.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The thermosetting powder coating compositions are prepared by melt blending the ingredients.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished by first blending the ingredients in a high shear mixer such as a planetary mixture, and then melt blending in an extruder from 80 (degree)  C. to 130 (degree)  C. The extrudate is then cooled and pulverized into a particulate blend.
      <br/>
      Such a particulate mixture can be applied preferably by spraying techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The powder coating composition and preferably the particulate thermosetting powder coating composition can be applied directly to a substrate of, for example, metal such as steel or aluminum.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the powder coating is a clearcoat for application over or with any basecoat formulations known to those skilled in the art such as water-borne basecoats.
      <br/>
      The film-forming composition of the base coat in the color-plus-clear system can be any of the compositions useful in coatings applications, particularly automotive applications.
      <br/>
      The film-forming composition of the base coat comprises a film-forming resinous binder and a pigment to act as the colorant.
      <br/>
      Particularly useful resinous binders are acrylic polymers, polyesters, including alkyds, and polyurethanes.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The base coat compositions may be solventborne or waterborne.
      <br/>
      Waterborne base coats in color-plus-clear compositions are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,403,003; EP 0038127; EP 0206615; EP 0502934; EP 0260447; EP 0281936; EP 0228003; and EP 0355433 and the resinous compositions used in preparing these base coats can be used in the practice of this invention.
      <br/>
      Also waterborne polyurethanes such as those prepared in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 4,147,679 can be used as the resinous binder in the base coat.
      <br/>
      Further, waterborne coatings such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,071,904 can be used as the base coat.
      <br/>
      Additional examples of such base coats include those solvent-borne and water-borne film-forming resinous materials that include one or more pigments such as those available from PPG Industries, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa., U.S.A.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The base coat contains pigments to give it color.
      <br/>
      Compositions containing metallic flake pigmentation are useful for the production of so-called "glamour metallic" finishes chiefly upon the surface of automobile bodies.
      <br/>
      Suitable metallic pigments include in particular aluminum flake, copper bronze flake and metal oxide coated mica.
      <br/>
      Besides the metallic pigments, the base coating compositions of the present invention may contain non-metallic color pigments conventionally used in surface coatings including inorganic pigments and organic pigments as mentioned above for the powder coating in amounts of 1 to 80 percent by weight based on weight of coating solids.
      <br/>
      The metallic pigment is employed in amounts of about 0.5 to 25 percent by weight based on weight of coating solids.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      If desired, the base coat composition may contain additional materials well known in the art of formulated surface coatings and may be applied by methods or techniques known in the art.
      <br/>
      The additional materials would include surfactants, flow control agents, thixotropic agents, fillers, anti-gassing agents, organic cosolvents, catalysts, and other customary auxiliaries.
      <br/>
      These materials can constitute up to 40 percent by weight of the total weight of the coating composition.
      <br/>
      The base coating compositions can be applied to various substrates to which they adhere including wood, metals, glass, and plastic.
      <br/>
      Such conventional means of application include brushing, dipping, flow coating, spraying and the like, but they are most often applied by spraying.
      <br/>
      The usual spray techniques and equipment for air spraying and electrostatic spraying and either manual or automatic methods can be used.
      <br/>
      During application of the base coat composition to the substrate, a film of the base coat is formed on the substrate.
      <br/>
      Typically, the base coat thickness will be about 0.01 to 5 mils (0.254 to 127 microns), preferably 0.1 to 2 mils (2.54 to 50.8 microns) and most preferably 5 to 30 microns in thickness.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      After application of the base coat to the substrate, a film is formed on the surface of the substrate by driving solvent, i.e., organic solvent or water, out of the base coat film by heating or by an air drying period.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the heating will only be for a short period of time, sufficient to ensure that the clear coat can be applied to the base coat without the former dissolving the base coat composition, yet insufficient to fully cure the basecoat.
      <br/>
      Suitable drying conditions will depend on the particular base coat composition and on the ambient humidity with certain waterborne compositions, but in general a drying time of from about 1 to 15 minutes at a temperature of about 80-250 (degree)  F. (20-121 (degree)  C.) is adequate.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the base coat film is adequately wetted by the clear coat composition so that satisfactory intercoat adhesion is obtained.
      <br/>
      Also, more than one base coat and multiple clear coats may be applied to develop the optimum appearance.
      <br/>
      Usually between coats, the previously applied coat is flashed, that is, exposed to ambient conditions for about 1 to 20 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Application of the powder coating composition of the present invention can be by spraying, and in the case of a metal substrate, by electrostatic spraying which is preferred, or by the use of a fluidized bed.
      <br/>
      The powder coating can be applied in a single sweep or in several passes to provide a film having a thickness after cure of from 1 to 15, preferably 1 to 6 mils (25.4 to 381 usually 25.4 to 152 microns).
      <br/>
      After application of the coating composition such as the preferred powder coating, the powder coating substrate is baked at a temperature sufficient to cure the coating, typically at about 250 (degree)  F. to about 400 (degree)  F. (121 (degree)  C. to 204 (degree)  C.) for about 1 to 60 minutes, and preferably at about 275 (degree)  F. to 350 (degree)  F. (135 (degree)  C. to 177 (degree)  C.) for about 10 to 30 minutes
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      While the powder coating composition can be applied directly upon bare metal, that is, upon untreated, unprimed steel or upon pretreated, i.e., phosphatized unprimed steel, in one embodiment of the invention the powder coating composition is applied to a metal substrate having a thin layer of electrodeposited primer coating.
      <br/>
      The electrodeposited primer coating upon the metal substrate can be, for example, a cathodic electrodeposition primer composition such as those available from PPG Industries, Inc. under the UNI-PRIME trademark.
      <br/>
      In one aspect of the present invention, it is contemplated that the powder coating composition can be applied directly upon at least a portion of an uncured electrodeposited primer coating, for example, the electrodeposited primer coating deposited over an automotive or truck body and thereafter both the electrodeposited primer coating and powder coating as a primer coating can be co-cured by heating at a temperature between 275 (degree)  F. to 350 (degree)  F. (135 (degree)  C. to 177 (degree)  C.) for about 10 to 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      As another aspect of the present invention, the aforementioned powder coating composition with the epoxy acrylic polymer as a single predominant film-forming polymer or as the blend of epoxy acrylic polymers is the clear unpigmented, or only slightly pigmented without interfering pigments, clear coat in a multilayered coating composite on substrates like those mentioned above.
      <br/>
      The multilayered coating composite can have one or more primer coats which can be any primer coating known to those skilled in the art and a basecoat for a basecoat plus clearcoat composite.
      <br/>
      For instance, the primer coat can be an electrodeposited primer coat of a cationic epoxy amine adduct cured with a polyisocyanate crosslinking agent alone or with solvent-borne primers.
      <br/>
      The basecoat can be any known to those skilled in the art like those noted above.
      <br/>
      In addition to the at least one epoxy acrylic polymer for the powder clear coat, other acrylic polymers and copolymers can be used as long as their Mn or weight average ("Mw") molecular weight is in a range similar to the aforementioned and hereinafter mentioned ranges for the epoxy acrylic polymer.
      <br/>
      This use is preferably as the predominant film-forming polymer as the aforedescribed epoxy acrylic polymer for the powder clear coat.
      <br/>
      These acrylic polymers and copolymers can have other functional groups with abstractable hydrogen such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino and suitable noninterfering mixtures thereof.

      The basecoated panels were flash baked for 10 minutes at 176 (degree)  F. (80 (degree)  C.) before electrostatically applying each powder clear coat composition.
      <br/>
      The powder coated panels were then cured for 30 minutes at 293 (degree)  F. (145 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      A powder clear wedge was applied with a dry film thickness (DFT) ranging from approximately 1 mil (25.4 microns) at the top of the panel to 6 mils (152.4 microns) at the bottom of the panel.
      <br/>
      The test panels were then tested for yellowing using a MacBeth Color Eye Instrument with illuminants C, A, and F at a 10 (degree)  observer and using the CIELAB Space Equation.
      <br/>
      The dB (yellow/blue), the dE (total color shift), and the yellowness index (YI) can be used to report yellowing.
      <br/>
      The dB and dE values are the difference in color between the powder clear at 2.5 mils (63.5 microns) and a color standard which is comprised of the same primer and basecoat conditions with a two component clear coat applied at a film thickness of 1.8 mils (45.7 microns).
      <br/>
      The Yellowing Value reported in Table 2 is a combination of the dB, dE, and/or yellowness index values.
      <br/>
      The color measurements are reported as the change along the yellow/blue color axis versus a commercial two coat isocyanate clear coating.
      <br/>
      Also measured was pop resistance (Gassing DFT) which is evaluated visually by examining the clearcoat wedge panels for pops and noting the film thickness at which the popping begins.
      <br/>
      This is done by visually viewing the wedge panel and determining the lowest film build without significant gassing for the panels coated with increasing film thickness along the distance from the top of the panel which had the lowest film build.
      <br/>
      No gassing defects on the panel from 5 to 8 mils (127 to 203 microns) was considered as good degassing and no gassing defects from 8 to 9 mils (203 to 230 microns) was considered excellent degassing.
      <br/>
      Table 2 describes further examples of this invention.

      As seen from Table 2 the coating compositions of the present invention in Examples 2-8 all had very good degassing properties like that of the coating composition of comparative examples A and B with benzoin.
      <br/>
      The coating composition of Example 1 gave good degassing properties at a lower amount of the acetoin.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the coating composition of Example 1 gave the benefit of only low yellow color development with a lower amount of acetoin present in the composition.
      <br/>
      Also Examples 2-4 with a higher amount acyloin compound of Structure I or Structure II with the methyl or primary alkyl groups gave only a medium level of yellow color development and gave very good degassing properties.
      <br/>
      This shows that the presence of the acyloin material of Structure I or II at lower or higher amounts in the composition allows for good to very good degassing properties as achieved with the benzoin but with less yellow color development.
