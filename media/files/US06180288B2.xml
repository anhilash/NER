    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Microcontact printing is a technique for forming patterns of organic monolayers with micrometer and submicron lateral dimensions.
      <br/>
      It offers experimental simplicity and flexibility in forming certain types of patterns.
      <br/>
      It relies on the remarkable ability of self-assembled monolayers of long-chain alkanethiolates to form on gold and other metals.
      <br/>
      These patterns can act as nanometer resists by protecting the supporting metal from corrosion by appropriately formulated etchants, or, can allow for the selective placement of fluids on hydrophilic regions of the pattern.
      <br/>
      Patterns of self-assembled monolayers having dimensions that can be less than 1  MU m are formed by using the alkanethiol as an "ink", and by printing them on the metal support using an elastomeric "stamp".
      <br/>
      The stamp is fabricated by molding a silicone elastomer using a master prepared by optical or X-ray microlithography or by other techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Microcontact printing of patterned self-assembled monolayers brings to microfabrication a number of new capabilities.
      <br/>
      First, microcontact printing makes it possible to form patterns that are distinguished only by their constituent functional groups; this capability permits the control of surface properties such as interfacial free energies with great precision.
      <br/>
      Second, because microcontact printing relies on molecular self-assembly, it generates a system that is (at least locally) close to a thermodynamic minimum and is intrinsically defect-rejecting and self-healing.
      <br/>
      Simple procedures, with minimal protection against surface contamination by adsorbed materials or by particles, can lead to surprisingly low levels of defects in the final structures.
      <br/>
      The procedure can be conducted at atmospheric pressure, in an unprotected laboratory atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Thus, microcontact printing is especially useful in laboratories that do not have routine access to the equipment normally used in microfabrication, or for which the capital cost of equipment is a serious concern.
      <br/>
      Third, the patterned self-assembled monolayers can be designed to act as resists with a number of wet-chemical etchants.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Working with liquid etchants suffers from the disadvantages of handling solvents and disposing of wastes, but also enjoys substantial advantages: a high degree of control over contamination of surfaces; reduced damage to the substrate from energetic interactions with atoms or ions; the ability to manipulate complex and sensitive organic functionalities.
      <br/>
      Because the self-assembled monolayers are only 1-3 nm thick, there is little loss in edge definition due to the thickness of the resist; the major determinants of edge resolution seem to be the fidelity of the contact printing and the anisotropy of etching the underlying metal.
      <br/>
      In the current best cases, features of size 0.2  MU m can be fabricated; edge resolution in systems showing this resolution in thickness is less than 50 nm.

      Gels are cross-linked networks of polymers swollen with a liquid.
      <br/>
      Softness, elasticity, and the capacity to store a fluid make gels unique materials, and soft and gentle materials are beginning to replace some of the hard mechanical materials in various industries.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Due to the cross-linking, various properties of individual polymers become visible on a macroscopic scale.
      <br/>
      The polymer network changes its volume in response to a change in environment: temperature, solvent composition, mechanical strain, electric field, exposure to light, pH, salt concentration, etc.

      Hydrophilic gels in aqueous solution have been the most widely studied, but almost any polymer can be cross linked to form a gel which will swell in a sufficiently good quality solvent.
      <br/>
      The three-dimensional network is stabilized by cross links which may be provided by covalent bonds, physical entanglements, crystallites, charge complexes, hydrogen bonding, van der Waal's or hydrophobic interactions.
      <br/>
      Gels have many technologically important roles in chemical separations, biomedical devices and absorbent products, to name a few areas.
      <br/>
      The properties that make gels useful include their sorption capacities, swelling kinetics, permeabilities to dissolved solutes, surface properties (e.g., adhesiveness), mechanical characteristics, and optical properties.
      <br/>
      The single most important property of a gel is its swelling degree, since most of the properties are directly influenced by this. S. H. Gehrke, p. 85, in Advances in Polymer Science, ed. K. Dusek, Vol. 110 (Springer-Verlag New York 1993).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      "Responsive" polymer gels are materials whose properties, most notably their solvent-swollen volumes, change in response to specific environmental stimuli including temperature, pH, electric field, solvent quality, light intensity and wavelength, pressure, ionic strength, ion identity, and specific chemical triggers, like glucose. S. Saito, pp. 207-232; M. Shibayama and T. Tanaka, pp. 1-62. The property which often changes the most dramatically is the swollen volume.
      <br/>
      These changes may occur discontinuously at a specific stimulus level (a phase transition), or gradually over a range of stimulus values.
      <br/>
      All of these changes are reversible with no inherent limit in lifetime.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Gels have been employed as chemical sensing surfaces, for example, in conjunction with fiber-optic systems, or elaborate mechanical or electrode systems.
      <br/>
      These systems are often quite elaborate, and suffer either from lack of flexibility or expense, or both.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,161 to J. Bergstrom, et al., discloses a matrix coating for surface plasmon resonance detection, to be used with a rigid dielectric material, such as a glass plate.

    <p num="10">
      The information-carrying capacity of light provides an elegant method for detecting and displaying information in a way that is readily interpreted by a human.
      <br/>
      Sensors that visibly change color in response to a surface antibody-antigen binding reaction are already commercially available.
      <br/>
      An example of such a device, based on thin film interference, is the group B streptococcal antigen detector made by Biostar (tm)  �G. R. Bogart, et al., "Devices and methods for detection of an analyte based upon light interference," U.S. Pat. No. 5,482,830, (Assignee: Biostar, Inc.
      <br/>
      Boulder, Colo.)�. Another example of a very simple optical-based sensor is where a Bragg reflector expands in the presence of water to change the reflected wavelength.
      <br/>
      The detection and display components both device are integrated so that an electronic display (with associated power supply and processing circuit) is not needed.
      <br/>
      However, that sort of detection device is suitable only for a narrow range of sensor applications.
      <br/>
      There is a need for a sensor technology platform that can be slightly modified to accommodate a wide range of stimuli and sensing conditions.
      <br/>
      There is a need, therefore, for a simple sensing system that takes full advantage of the responsive properties of gels, but which is flexible, easy to use, and preferably, disposable.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The present invention comprises an optically diffracting sensing device in which the diffraction pattern changes upon exposure to predetermined stimuli.
      <br/>
      The diffraction pattern may be two or three dimensional and, in one embodiment, the change in diffraction patterns is recognizable to the unaided eye.
      <br/>
      The sensing device of the present invention further comprises one or more gels coated onto patterned, self-assembling monolayers of, for example, alkanethiolates, carboxylic acids, hydroxamic acids, or phosphonic acids printed onto a variety of substrates including, but not limited to, glass, silicon, aluminum oxide, and thermoplastic films metallized with gold, or with an alloy such as nickel/gold.
      <br/>
      Other substrates that can be used according to the present invention include, but are not limited to, CrOx, CuOx, AgOx, platinum, and lead.
      <br/>
      The gels used according to the present invention are capable of responding to the presence or change in stimuli.
      <br/>
      Usually the response is a change in volume, shape, color or a change in refractive index.
      <br/>
      The stimuli can be a chemical compound or a physical parameter such as environment: temperature, solvent composition, mechanical strain, electric field, exposure to light, pH, salt concentration, solvent quality, light intensity and wavelength, pressure, ionic strength, ion identity, and specific chemical triggers, e.g., glucose.
      <br/>
      The present invention also comprises the method of making the sensing device and the use of this device.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Patterned self-assembling monolayers allow for the controlled placement of the gel thereon.
      <br/>
      The term "patterned self-assembling monolayers thereon" as used herein means the self-assembling monolayers in any pattern on the metallized polymer films including a solid pattern.
      <br/>
      The optical sensing devices of the present invention produce optical diffraction patterns which differ depending on the reaction of the self-assembling monolayer and the gel with the stimulus of interest.
      <br/>
      The electromagnetic radiation that is diffracted is preferably in the visible spectrum, and can be either reflected from the substrate or transmitted through the substrate.
      <br/>
      The stimulus to be measured by the sensing device of the present invention can be any substance or physical parameter that interacts with the gel or with an analyte in the gel.
      <br/>
      It is contemplated as part of the invention that the gel can contain an analyte that will react with a stimulus thereby causing the gel to change in volume, shape, color or refractive index.
      <br/>
      Thus, it can be the gel interacting directly with the stimulus or the gel can contain an analyte that reacts with the stimulus.

    <p num="20">
      Gels, as used in the present invention, have both liquid-like and solid-like properties.
      <br/>
      The liquid-like properties result from the fact that the major constituent of gels is usually a liquid, e.g., water.
      <br/>
      For example, a jelly consists of approximately 97% water and 3% gelatin.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a gel can retain its shape since it has a shear modulus which becomes apparent when the gel is deformed.
      <br/>
      The modulus is due to the cross-linking of the polymers in the form of a network.
      <br/>
      These aspects of a gel represent the solid nature of gels.
      <br/>
      In addition to these liquid- and solid-like aspects, a gel can change its state drastically, similar to the way a gas changes its volume more than a thousand fold.
      <br/>
      Two states of gels; the collapsed and swollen states, correspond to the liquid and the gas states of fluids respectively.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 shows a graph of a temperature induced volume transition in a gel, where the ordinate gives the temperature in degrees Celsius, and the abscissa gives the ratio of resultant volume to original volume.
      <br/>
      As can be seen by the graph, a sharp volume transition occurs for this gel between 34 and 36 degrees Celsius.
      <br/>
      The right hand side of FIG. 8 is a schematization of a volume change of a gel due to factors such as solvent composition, temperature, ions, pH, light, and electric field.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A gel can be viewed as a container of solvent made of a three dimensional mesh.
      <br/>
      In a dried state, a gel is a solid material.
      <br/>
      However, a gel swells until it reaches the swelling equilibrium when a solvent is added.
      <br/>
      The solvent molecules are kept in the three dimensional mesh and the combination of the mesh and the solvent molecules creates a "world" having characteristic properties.
      <br/>
      This world can be either isolated from (isochore) or linked to (isobar) its surrounding world by changing the population, i.e., the solvent molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A gel can be a "single polymer molecule".
      <br/>
      The term "single polymer molecule" means that all the monomer units in a one piece of gel are connected to each other and form one big molecule on a macroscopic scale.
      <br/>
      Because of this nature, a gel is a macroscopic representation of single polymer behavior.
    </p>

      Many kinds of external stimuli, such as, temperature, pH, photons, ions, electric current (field), etc., can control the volume of the gel.

      Particularly, in the case of volume phase transition, an enormous change in volume can be induced by an infinitesimal change of one of the these stimuli, and this is of great importance in the present invention, as an actuator, sensor, switching device and so on.

      In one embodiment of the present invention, a hydrazide function is created in the dextran matrix for binding ligands containing aldehyde groups, for example antibodies, in which the carbohydrate chain has been oxidized so that it then contains an aldehyde function.
      <br/>
      In this instance, the dextran matrix is initially modified with carboxymethyl groups which are partly reacted to form hydrazide groups.
      <br/>
      With this activated matrix at least two important advantages are obtained: (1) This matrix contains unreacted carboxyl groups which in low ionic strength conditions will act as ion exchangers, and by electrostatic interaction the ligand which is to be immobilized is connected to the dextran matrix; (2) This matrix will very efficiently bind the ligand thus concentrated at the surface, viz. by condensation of ligand aldehyde groups with the hydrazide function of the matrix.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      According to another embodiment of the present invention, a part of the carboxyl groups in carboxymethyl-modified dextran are modified so as to give reactive ester functions, e.g., by treatment with an aqueous solution of N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride.
      <br/>
      In the same way as in the example described above, the residual charges, i.e., unreacted carboxyl groups, will contribute to effecting a concentration of ligands on the surface.
      <br/>
      Ligands containing amine groups such as, for example, proteins and peptides, may then be coupled to the dextran matrix by covalent bonds.

    <p num="31">
      According to an alternative procedure, the aforesaid reactive ester is utilized for reaction with a disulfide-containing compound such as, for instance, 2-(2-pyridinyldithio) ethanamine: in this manner a matrix is obtained which contains disulfide groups, and these can be employed for coupling thiol-containing ligands such as, for example, reduced F(ab) fragments of immunoglobulins (see Brocklehurst, K., et al., J. Biochem., vol. 133, p. 573, et seq. (1973), incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      After cleavage of the disulfide bonds, for instance, by reduction or thioldisulfide exchange, the thiol modified surface formed can be used for coupling of a disulfide-containing ligand such as, for instance, N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridinyldithio) propionate (SPDP) modified proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The advantage of this procedure is that the ligands via, for example, a reduction step can be cleaved off to give a sensing surface with reactive thiols.
      <br/>
      This thiol-modified surface can, in an analogous procedure, be used for renewed covalent coupling of thiol- or disulfide-containing ligands.
      <br/>
      In this way the capability of chemical regeneration of the sensing surface can be obtained, which can be used for general utilization of the same surface for couplings of several different ligands.
      <br/>
      The procedure can also be used when, for example, a biological interaction is studied, and this interaction cannot be broken while retaining biological activity of the immobilized ligand.

      In summary, there are a multitude of ligands that can be employed for the detection of biomolecules by means of interacting therewith.

      Self-assembled monolayers of organic compounds on inorganic or metal surfaces are becoming increasingly important in many areas of materials science.

      Although there are many different systems of self-assembling monolayers based on different organic components and supports, desired systems are those of alkanethiolates, HS(CH2)n R. Typically, a gold film, 5 to 2000 nm thick, is supported on a titanium-primed Si/SiO2 wafer or glass sheet.
      <br/>
      The titanium serves as an adhesion promoter between gold and the support.

      The alkanethiols chemisorb on the gold surface from a solution in which the gold film is immersed, and form adsorbed alkanethiolates with loss of hydrogen.

      Adsorption can also occur from the vapor.
      <br/>
      Self-assembling monolayers formed on gold from long-chain alkanethiolates of structure X(CH2)n Y--(CH2)m S are highly ordered and can be considered as crystalline or quasi-crystalline molecular arrays.

      FIG. 1 outlines the procedure used for microcontact printing onto a substrate.
      <br/>
      An elastomeric stamp is used to transfer by contact alkanethiol "ink" to a surface coated with a metal alloy.
      <br/>
      In a desired embodiment, the alloy surface is predominantly gold.
      <br/>
      Preferred alloys are those such as nickel/gold, which are known to show an enrichment in the surface concentration of gold relative to its bulk concentration.
      <br/>
      Prediction of surface segregation of one metal of an alloy is described in M. P. Seah, "Quantitative Prediction of Surface Segregation," Journal of Catalysis, vol. 57, pp. 450-457 (1979), and J. J. Burton, et al., "Prediction of Segregation to Alloy Surfaces from Bulk Phase Diagrams," Physical Review Letters, vol. 37, No. 21, pp. 1433-1436 (Nov. 22, 1976), both incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the invention, the metal alloy has surface enrichment of a metal reacting with the self-assembling monolayer.
      <br/>
      If the stamp is patterned, a patterned self-assembling monolayer forms.
      <br/>
      The stamp is fabricated by casting polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on a master having the desired pattern.
      <br/>
      Masters are prepared using standard photolithographic techniques, or constructed from existing materials having microscale surface features.
      <br/>
      These methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,131 and copending U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/707,456 entitled, "Method of Contact Printing on Metal Alloy Coated Polymer Films," and the U.S. patent application entitled, "Method of Contact Printing on Gold Coated Films," filed Dec. 18, 1996, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In a typical procedure, a photolithographically produced master is placed in a glass or plastic Petri dish, and a 10:1 ratio (w:w or v:v) mixture or SYLGARD.RTM. silicone elastomer 184 and SYLGARD.RTM. silicone elastomer 184 curing agent (Dow Corning Corporation) is poured over it.
      <br/>
      The elastomer is allowed to sit for approximately 30 minutes at room temperature and pressure to degas, then cured for 1 to 4 hours at 60 (degree)  C., and gently peeled from the master. "Inking" of the elastomeric stamp is accomplished by exposing the stamp to a 0.1 to 10 mM solution of alkanethiol in anhydrous ethanol, either by pouring the solution over the surface of the stamp, or by rubbing the stamp gently with a Q-TIP.RTM. that has been saturated with the inking solution.
      <br/>
      The stamp is allowed to dry until no liquid is visible by eye on the surface of the stamp (typically about 60 seconds), either under ambient conditions, or by exposure to a stream of nitrogen gas.
      <br/>
      Following inking, the stamp is applied to a metal alloy, e.g., nickel/gold surface.
      <br/>
      Very light hand pressure is used to aid in complete contact between the stamp and the surface.
      <br/>
      The stamp is then gently peeled from the surface.
      <br/>
      Following removal of the stamp, the surface is washed of excess thiol and the patterned metal alloy surface can be subjected to chemical etchants (see below) that selectively remove underivatized areas of the metal alloy surface, and if desired, the underlying support(s).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, further derivatization of unstamped areas can be accomplished, either by using a second stamp, or by washing the entire surface with a different alkanethiol.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The elastomeric character of the stamp is essential to the success of the process.
      <br/>
      Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), when cured, is sufficiently elastomeric to allow good conformal contact of the stamp and the surface, even for surfaces with significant relief; this contact is essential for efficient contact transfer of the alkanethiol "ink" to the alloy-coated film.
      <br/>
      The elastomeric properties of PDMS are also important when the stamp is removed from the master.
      <br/>
      If the stamp is rigid (as is the master) it is difficult to separate the stamp and master after curing without damaging one of the two substrates.
      <br/>
      PDMS is also sufficiently rigid to retain its shape, even for features with sub-micron dimensions.
      <br/>
      Patterns with lines as small as 200 nm in width have been generated.
      <br/>
      The surface of PDMS has a low interfacial free energy (y=22.1 dynes/cm), and the stamp does not adhere to the metal alloy coated film.
      <br/>
      The stamp is durable.
      <br/>
      The same stamp has been used up to 100 times over a period of several months without significant degradation in performance.
      <br/>
      The polymeric nature of PDMS also plays a critical role in the inking procedure by enabling the stamp to absorb the alkanethiol ink by swelling.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Microcontact printing on metal alloy surfaces can be conducted with a variety of alkanethiol "inks".
      <br/>
      Alkanethiols that do not undergo reactive spreading (after application to the metal alloy film) are required for formation of small features with high resolution.
      <br/>
      For stamping in air, one can use autophobic alkanethiols such as hexadecanethiol.
      <br/>
      Microcontact printing of other non-autophobic alkanethiols, for example, HS(CH2)15 COOH, can be conducted by stamping under a liquid such as water.
      <br/>
      Patterned self-assembling monolayers of alkanethiols on metal alloy provide excellent resist character with a number of wet-chemical etchants.
      <br/>
      See U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,131 to A. Kumar and G. M. Whitesides, incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the self-assembling monolayer is formed of a carboxy-terminated alkane thiol stamped with a patterned elastomeric stamp onto a nickel/gold-surfaced thermoplastic film such as MYLAR.RTM.. The stamp is inked with a solution of alkanethiol in ethanol, dried, and brought into contact with a surface of nickel/gold.
      <br/>
      The alkanethiol is transferred to the surface only at those regions where the stamp contacts the surface, producing a pattern of self-assembling monolayer which is defined by the pattern of the stamp.
      <br/>
      Optionally, areas of unmodified nickel/gold surface next to the stamped areas can be rendered hydrophobic by reaction with a methyl-terminated alkane thiol.
      <br/>
      The film is then contacted with a solution capable of forming a gel, e.g., an aqueous solution of N-isopropylacryamide: for example, to coat the film it may be drawn though a two phase system of water and toluene.
      <br/>
      The polymer then assembles onto the patterned, hydrophilic SAM, forming the sensing device of the present invention.

      A desirable embodiment of the present invention is a thermoplastic film substrate upon which the SAM with the gel is placed.

      <br/>
      In a desired embodiment of the present invention, the thermoplastic film has at least an approximately 80% optical transparency, and the thickness of the metal coating is such as to maintain an optical transparency greater than about 20%, so that diffraction patterns can be produced by either reflected or transmitted light.

      This corresponds to a metal coating thickness of about 20 nm.

      A computer algorithm is used to calculate and generate diffraction hologram patterns of pre-defined objects.. Transfer of the computer-generated pattern to a responsive gel on metallized MYLAR.RTM. was accomplished via a simple printing process.

      Applications for optical holography include digital data storage, microscopy, spectroscopy pattern recognition, and displays.

      Handbook of Optical Holography, H. J. Caulfield, editor (New York Academic Press 1979), incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Many of these applications rely on traditional holographic methods which are not well suited to the requirements of a sensor device.
    </p>
    <p num="61">The present invention allows one to computer-generate a complex holographic pattern of a specified object, print it on high resolution film, and convert the patterned elastomeric stamp for final transfer to a substrate upon which a selectively responsive material can be self-assembled to form the light-diffracting hologram pixels.</p>
    <p num="62">
      The ability to easily view a holographic image with the unaided eye involves consideration of a number of variables including (1) lighting conditions, (2) the refractive index modulation amplitude in the holographic material, (3) the hologram information content, (4) the type of hologram (volume phase, amplitude, transmission, reflection, etc.), (5) the thickness of the active diffraction layer, and (6) the hologram's activated pixel population.
      <br/>
      The use of a hologram for a sensor application requires precise receptor patterning, micro-reactor site activation by the stimulant, and a corresponding local change in light absorption or refractive index.
    </p>
    <p num="63">In the present invention, sensor information extracted from the light pattern diffracting from a regular array of micro-bumps is quantified and related to physical changes (size, shape, and refractive index) at the micro-bump level.</p>
    <p num="64">
      According to the present invention, the hologram pattern is fabricated for sensor applications.
      <br/>
      The method according to the present invention is compatible with continuous-print processes and it involves the following steps: (a) computation of the printed hologram pattern based on a preselected visual image to display, (b) formatting and printing the pattern on high-resolution transparency film, (c) photolithographic conversion of the pattern from gray-scale to surface-relief, (d) conversion of the surface-relief pattern to an elastomeric stamp, (e) stamp printing hydrophilic/hydrophobic mono-layer regions on a metallized MYLAR.RTM. substrate, and finally, (f) assembling analyte-responsive material on regions defined in the stamp printing process.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      A special light source, such as a laser pointer or a white-light point source, is desirable for viewing the printed holographic image.
      <br/>
      Each location in the printed hologram contains information about a perspective view of the whole image.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when a laser pointer is used to project the image onto a screen, the beam only needs to propagate through a small section of the hologram to reconstruct the whole image.
      <br/>
      Alignment is not critical.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      According to the present invention, a hologram pattern printed on a two-dimensional (surface) substrate represents only the real part of the complex light propagation information.
      <br/>
      Therefore, both a real and a symmetric conjugate (virtual) image are reconstructed during viewing.
      <br/>
      The "dual" image formation lends an added degree of flexibility but it also effectively reduces the unobscured, viewable image space by half.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The size, relative position, and information content of the holographic image are all limited by the resolution capabilities of the printer.
      <br/>
      A 3600 dot per inch (dpi) printout limits the image full fan angle to just over 5 degrees (the farther away from the film, the larger the image can be).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, to avoid overlap with the twin image, the effective image fan angle for a hologram generated with a maximum 3600 dpi resolution is reduced to 2.5 degrees.
      <br/>
      Methods exist whereby a 10 times photolithographic reduction of the hologram pattern can be used to increase the effective density of the pixels to 36,000 dpi, thereby, increasing the effective (unobscured) image fan angle to 32 degrees.
      <br/>
      If higher resolution is necessary conventional photo or electron beam lithographic processes can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The diffracted image can be optimized for the specific method of indication.
      <br/>
      For example, an image as simple as a single, off-axis, projected dot may be ideal when using a photo-diode for detection, but a complex symbol image such as a skull and crossbones may be better suited for detection by the human eye.
      <br/>
      Each type of image can be specified; however, the hologram computation time increases linearly with each added image pixel.

      A diffraction based sensor according to the present invention utilizes the interaction of light with a sensing medium to alter the transmitted or reflected diffraction pattern.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 shows a periodic structure consisting of polymer micro-bumps patterned in an array.
      <br/>
      A change in the array's micro-bump size, shape, color, optical density, or refractive index may be triggered by the presence of some particular analyte in the local environment.
      <br/>
      Understanding the relationship between this physical change and the ensuing light diffraction change is important in the design of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      A side-view of the array and the resulting (forward) diffraction orders is depicted in FIG. 11. Lower case lambda ( LAMBDA ) is the wavelength of the incoming light, and upper case lambda ( LAMBDA ) represents the bump center to center spacing.
      <br/>
      Incident monochromatic light with wavelength  LAMBDA  is diffracted into several orders with each particular order m characterized by the diffraction angle phi (sub m) equals arcsin (lamda * m)/ LAMBDA , for m equals 0,  +- 1,  +- 2, . . . ,  +-  LAMBDA / LAMBDA .
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      As can be concluded from FIG. 11, no sensing information is obtained by tracking the angle of diffraction; however, changes in the bump size and shape will be reflected in the relative intensities of the diffraction orders.
      <br/>
      A change in bump spacing, however, will change the diffraction angle.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The far-field diffraction pattern for a typical micro-bump array is shown in FIG. 12. The left-hand side of FIG. 12 gives a diffraction pattern for a micro-bump array with a 15 micron period, and one for a 3 micron period on the right.
      <br/>
      The brightness or irradiance of each spot is related to the statistical average physical shape, size, and refractive index of the sampled bumps.
      <br/>
      The sampled bumps include all bumps illuminated by the probe beam.
      <br/>
      The spot irradiance and the bump profile are mathematically related by the Fourier coefficients of the near field transmitted beam series expansion expression.
      <br/>
      FIG. 13 graphically illustrates this relationship.
      <br/>
      The transmitted far field electric field magnitude .vertline.T(u).vertline. is periodic, because the light wave front is periodically perturbed (delayed) as it travels through the higher refractive index micro-bumps, where each order's electric field (a0, a1, a2, . . . ) is related to the perturbed wave front's Fourier series coefficient.
      <br/>
      Wave-fronts traveling through the bumps undergo a phase delay in proportion to the path-length traveled through the bump.
      <br/>
      The periodic phase-delay perturbation gives rise to a periodic far-field pattern.
      <br/>
      The far-field electric field magnitude of the diffraction pattern spots are related to the bump profile, h(x), through the near-field transmitted electric field, t(x)=exp(j kh(x)), where k=2 pi n/ LAMBDA , where n is the refractive index of the bump region.
      <br/>
      The Fourier coefficients, and hence the square root of the detected irradiance for each order are calculated by the overlap integral: a (sub m)=(1/ LAMBDA ) R, where R is the quantity t(x)cos(mkx) integrated from - LAMBDA /2 up to + LAMBDA /2, where it is assumed that t(x) is a symmetric function.
      <br/>
      If t(x) is not symmetric, one must also calculate the overlap integral of t(x) with the odd function, sin(mkx).
      <br/>
      This Fourier series coefficient expression is what allows us to predict and relate a change in the micro-bump array diffraction pattern to a change in the bump characteristics, which in turn are related to the local analyte concentration.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      An example calculation depicting the diffraction order irradiance for two truncated cosinusoidal functions of different height is shown in FIG. 14. This figure illustrates a calculated half-plane, on-axis diffraction pattern irradiance for two different micro-bump arrays with refractive index=1.5, period  LAMBDA =15 micrometers, bump width=10 micrometers, bump height=1.5 micrometers (large dots), bump height=0.9 micrometers (small dots).
      <br/>
      The abscissa is in degrees, and the ordinate is measured in power % of total transmittal of irradiance.
      <br/>
      An individual bump profile is shown in the inset.
      <br/>
      The example diffraction spectra shown in FIG. 14 illustrates a unique and measurable relationship between the bump shape and the diffraction pattern irradiance.
      <br/>
      Thus, an analyte-induced change in the bump profile would give rise to an intensity change in one or more diffraction orders.
      <br/>
      This intensity change can be measured, and in turn, related to the presence of analyte in the local environment.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The principal drawback associated with the micro-bump array diffraction sensor is the difficulty in relating and quantifying the changes in the detected diffraction irradiance signal to an input stimulus (i.e., temperature, pH, etc.).
      <br/>
      Small errors introduced at any point in the transformation from detected irradiance to temperature scale are greatly multiplied due to the non-linear transformations.
      <br/>
      Sensitivity for such a device is highly dependent on the bump geometry and initial volume.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since the gel has a minimum trigger temperature and since it undergoes an approximate 10 times volume change over a few degrees, the dynamic range of the sensing device of the present invention is extremely limited.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      One of the goals established from the onset was that the detection results should be easily interpreted without the aid of support electronics.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is necessary to assemble the micro-bump reactors in a pattern such that the diffracted light forms an image that is easily recognizable by the eye.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a salient feature of the diffracted image should change to indicate detection of a pre-selected analyte in the local environment.

    <p num="91">Condensation Figures</p>
    <p num="92">
      Condensation figures (CFs) are arrays of liquid drops that form upon condensation of vapor onto high surface energy regions of a patterned solid surface.
      <br/>
      The examination of condensation figures has historically been used as a method to characterize the degree of contamination on an otherwise homogeneous surface.
      <br/>
      One is able to impose a pattern on arrays of condensed drops by patterning the surface underlying them into regions of different solid-vapor interfacial free energy and to characterize the patterned CFs by photomicroscopy and optical diffraction.
      <br/>
      It can be demonstrated that appropriately patterned CFs can be used as optical diffraction gratings and that examination of the diffraction patterns provides both a rapid, nondestructive method for characterizing patterned self-assembling monolayers and an approach to sensing the environment (see FIG. 6, explained below).
      <br/>
      Because the form of the CFs--that is, the size, density, and distribution of the drops is sensitive to environmental factors, CFs of appropriate size and pattern diffract light and can be used as sensors.
      <br/>
      This principle is demonstrated by correlating the temperature of a substrate patterned into hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, in an atmosphere of constant relative humidity, with the intensity of light diffracted from CFs on these regions.

      Polymer film thickness between 2 and 7 mils and gold topcoats producing a surface resistance of 65 ohms per square centimeter with a visible light transmittance between 20% and 65% were used.

      <br/>
      The elements of the set-up include a Helium/Neon laser, a remote shutter, a polarizer, a neutral density filter, a mirror, and expander, an iris, a sample, a lens, a Fourier transformed lens, a zoom lens, a CCD camera, a monitor, a frame grabber, and a computer with image analysis software.

      Coherent light with wavelength  LAMBDA =0.6328 micrometers was diffracted by the sample which was enclosed in an environment chamber.

      The diffraction orders were collected by a lens and imaged onto a CCD camera where the image was displayed on a monitor and stored on a computer for image processing and analysis.
      <br/>
      This experimental setup was used to measure the two dimensional diffraction image intensity from a self-assembled-monolayer (SAM)-patterned array of temperature-responsive poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA).
      <br/>
      The poly-NIPA bumps undergo a volume shrinkage with increasing temperature, therefore, the detected diffraction order irradiance from one spot to the next changed, as was predicted by the model, with a rise in temperature.
      <br/>
      An example image captured during this experiment is shown below in FIG. 16. The zero order beam in this figure was blocked to eliminate CCD saturation. S. Hirotsu, Y. Hirokawa, and T.

    <p num="114">Conversion from the diffraction pattern's gray-scale image to temperature scale must be done with extreme care because it involves at least five sequential transformations including: (1) a non-linear relationship between the gel temperature and the micro-bump volume, (2) a relationship between the bump volume and shape, (3) a non-linear (oscillating) relationship between the bump shape and the signal detected with the CCD device (see FIG. 17) and finally, (4) scaling and quantization of the detected signal for digital storage of the image.</p>
    <p num="115">
      Assuming the bump is cosinusoidal shaped with height h, and constant base diameter d, the volume v, of the microbump is v=hd2 (1-2/pi), i.e., the volume is linearly related to the height for this shape.

      FIG. 17 is a graph of the first-order diffraction irradiance as a function of the micro-bump height for a bump refractive index of 1.5, base width of 10 micrometers, and a period of 15 micrometers.

      The oscillating irradiance curve is linear in a finite range, and limits the useful bump height to approximately 0.3 micrometers for this geometry.

    <p num="119">
      The hologram computation is based on traditional holography theory with adjustments made to account for physical considerations such as printer resolution, wavelength scaling, sampling theory, and image content.
      <br/>
      The recent development and availability of high-resolution film printers is one of key enabling technologies which has allowed rapid refinement cycles and cost effective hologram synthesis.
      <br/>
      It should be stressed that the diffracted image quality is directly limited by the printer resolution, i.e., by how small and close together individual dots can be placed in the printer output.
      <br/>
      A 3600 dot per inch specification means that the minimum resolution the printer is capable of producing is 7 micrometer diameter dots with a 7 micrometer center- to center spacing.
      <br/>
      To put this into perspective, standard holographic silver halide films range in grain size from 0.05 micrometers to 1.0 micrometers.
      <br/>
      The table below summarizes the "rule of thumb" resolution requirements for embossed holograms of various quality.
      <br/>
      One must be aware that the 7 micrometer feature-size is huge in terms of traditional display holography and severe limitations are imposed by such resolution, nevertheless, a limited class of special thin transmission holograms can be readily made with such resolution, enabling low-cost development and testing of the holographic diffraction sensor.

      FIG. 18 depicts the geometry for a traditional holographic transparency recording setup.
      <br/>
      The figure shows an object plane, a film plane, a signal beam, and a reference beam, with a smiling face as the holographic image.
      <br/>
      Cartesian coordinates are also shown, with (0,0,0) as the reference point, and Phi as the angle the reference beam makes with the z axis in the x-z plane.
      <br/>
      The object plane consists of small transparent holes in an opaque background.
      <br/>
      The signal and reference beams are assumed mutually coherent and monochromatic.
      <br/>
      The light propagating from each point in the object plane can be expressed, using Huygen's principle, as an expanding spherical wave with an electric field phasor representation: E(r)=exp(jkr)/r, where k=2 pi/ LAMBDA  and j=sqrt(-1).
      <br/>
      The reference plane-wave beam is incident on the film plane at an angle phi sub(ref) with respect to the film normal.
      <br/>
      The image beam and the reference beam interfere and the constructive/destructive interference pattern is recorded in the film.
      <br/>
      Setting phi sub(ref)=0 reduces the resolution requirements of the film but an on-axis hologram is produced.
      <br/>
      The drawbacks of the on-axis hologram will be discussed subsequently.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      The holographic recording setup in FIG. 18 can be modeled on a computer and an interference pattern at the film plane can be calculated, converted to a gray-scale bit map image, and printed out on a high-resolution film printer.
      <br/>
      The result is a computer generated transparency hologram.
      <br/>
      Each of the N object points (i.e., the dots making up the smile-face image in FIG. 18) are expressed in Cartesian coordinates as (x0, y0, z0).
      <br/>
      Each point can be assigned a unique position, therefore, 3-dimensional object representation is allowed.
      <br/>
      Each point in the film plane is expressed as (xf, yf, zf) where zf is the minimum distance from the object to the film plane, and it is usually a fixed value, thereby denoting a flat piece of recording film.
      <br/>
      A convenient zero-phase reference point in the film plane is picked and designated (xf0, yf0, zf0).
      <br/>
      The minimum distance from each point on the object to an arbitrary point on the film is:
      <br/>
      r=�(x0 -xf)2 +(y0 -yf)2 +(z0 -zf)2 �1/2
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      The radial distance to the zero- phase reference point is:
      <br/>
      r0 =�(x0 -xf0)2 +(y0 -yf0)2 +(z0 -zf0)2 �1/2
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      The difference between the r and r0, scaled by the propagation constant, k, gives the differential phase of the image wave for each point on the film plane.
      <br/>
      The main hologram synthesis equation is:
      <br/>
      H(xf, yf)= SIGMA  exp �jk(r-r0)-x sin (phi sub(ref))�
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      summed from n=1 to N. The synthesis equation is used in calculating the contribution of each N points comprising the object and it is solved at each sample point (xf, yf, zf) in the film plane.
      <br/>
      If the film plane is to be represented by an M * M array of sample points, then the number of synthesis calculations required is N * M2.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      The synthesized hologram consists of a two-dimensional array of sample points representing the complex phase and amplitude of the interference pattern between object and reference beams.
      <br/>
      Conversion of the complex array values to a gray-scale must be done before printing the hologram pattern because only the amplitude information can be represented by the printer.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      Since the imaginary part of the information is discarded in the conversion, it makes no sense to calculate it in the first place.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a more efficient and direct synthesis equation is:
      <br/>
      H(xf, yf)= SIGMA  cos (jk�(r-r0)-x sin (phi sub(ref))�
    </p>
    <p num="128">where the summation is from n=1 to N. This synthesis equation can be implemented with a computer, for example, the MathCad program (MathSoft, Cambridge, Mass.).</p>
    <p num="129">Example 6</p>
    <p num="130">Sampling Requirements</p>
    <p num="131">
      Care must be taken to calculate enough points on the hologram interference pattern (i.e., to sample at a sufficiently high spatial frequency) so that the information is preserved and aliasing does not occur.
      <br/>
      A form of the Shannon or Nyquist sampling theorem can be applied to the case at hand. A. V. Oppenheim and R. W. Schafer, Discrete time signal processing (Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 1989), incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      However, a more direct and physically appealing method was devised to gain insight into the problem and to assist with the design.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      Since the calculated hologram consists of periodic sample points which, upon printout, are separated by a minimum center-to-center spacing of  LAMBDA =7 micrometers (due to the resolution of the printer), the reconstructed image will also be repeated periodically in space with an angular repetition (recall FIG. 11) equal to:
      <br/>
      PHI m =sin-1 ( LAMBDA x/ LAMBDA )
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      which is approximately 5 degrees for red light incidence ( LAMBDA =0.6328 micrometers).
      <br/>
      This means that the full image fan angle can not exceed 5 degrees without overlapping with the replicated images.
      <br/>
      Full use of the image plane is possible only when the printer resolution is equal to the incident wavelength, and when the all the complex phase information is retained.
      <br/>
      The limited printer resolution ultimately limits the extent of the image and specifies the minimum image projection distance from the film for a given image extent.

    <p num="135">Conjugate Beam Aberrations</p>
    <p num="136">Another consideration that plays an important role in the hologram design is the unwanted twin or conjugate beam that arises due to the inability to print all the phase information.</p>
    <p num="137">
      There are two possible objects giving rise to the same hologram pattern due to the uncertainty of pi in recording phase: one is the original object, the other is a virtual object located symmetrically on the other side of the film plane.

      This concept is illustrated in FIG. 19. FIG. 19 illustrates the twin images arising from the hologram, the virtual image on the left-hand side of FIG. 19, and the real image on the right-hand side, with the viewer positioned at the lower right-hand corner.

      <br/>
      The angle of diffraction is set by the local period, just as illustrated in FIG. 11. One set of diffraction orders comprise the real image and converge to a point to the right of the film plane.
      <br/>
      The other set of orders diverge from the film plane in a pattern that appear to the eye to be coming from a point located at the virtual image.
      <br/>
      FIG. 20 illustrates conjugate beam haze.

      The projected image on the left is illuminated through hologram center.

      Image on right is illuminated slightly off-center to illustrate the symmetric conjugate image placement.
      <br/>
      This figure demonstrates the effect of the twin beam aberration for an example real image.
      <br/>
      In viewing the image of the real object, one has to look through an out-of-focus background image of the virtual object, a most annoying disturbance, and one of the problems that plagued the first holograms made by Dennis Gabor in 1948. D. Gabor, "A new microscopic principle," Nature, vol. 161, pp. 777-778 (1948).
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      In the early 1960's, Leith and Upatnieks discovered that the twin-beam problem could be alleviated by modulating the signal beam on a carrier to spatially separate the real and virtual image beams.

      <br/>
      This so-called "off-axis hologram" geometry is accomplished either by centering the object and shifting the reference beam angle, or equivalently, by setting the reference beam to zero and shifting the object off axis.
      <br/>
      Care must be taken to insure that the combined reference beam angle and the image cone angle are within the limited angular range defined by the sampling period.

      The ability to "print" a hologram with responsive material is an important factor in the fabricating a sensing device according to the present invention.

      The use of MYLAR.RTM. as a hologram base substrate is important to high volume, continuous processing, and cost per unit reduction.

    <p num="144">Example 9</p>
    <p num="145">Computer bitmap</p>
    <p num="146">
      The hologram generated by the computer is initially stored in the form of a 256-level gray-scale bitmap pattern.
      <br/>
      Each pixel in the bitmap, therefore, is represented by one byte of information.
      <br/>
      The image storage requirements are set by the total number of samples.
      <br/>
      For example, a 1000 * 1000 dot gray-scale bitmap occupies approximately 1 megabyte of memory.
      <br/>
      An example of the type of hologram pattern that is produced from a recognizable object is shown below in FIG. 21. The recognizable object is on the left-hand side, and its associated hologram is on the right-hand side.

      Once the hologram bitmap is calculated, it is converted to a tagged image format (.tif) file and imported into a graphics application such as CorelDraw (Ottawa, Ontario Canada), which is capable of converting the image file to a printer file.

      The fact that each spot in the film contains a separate perspective view of the entire image is one of the most useful characteristics of the hologram, part of the film may become damaged but the image may be viewed simply by moving to a different location on the film.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      Another useful attribute associated with the real image reconstruction is shift invariance.
      <br/>
      Incident light can be scanned across the film plane with no apparent shift in the image.
      <br/>
      This characteristic is very useful in fixed-position detector systems where precise positioning of the responsive hologram film is impractical.
