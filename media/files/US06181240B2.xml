    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">a) Technical Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a tire-safety sensing device, and in particular, to a device which can sense the status of the tire pressure of a vehicle during driving so that safety precautions can be taken in case the tire pressure is insufficient.</p>
    <p num="3">b) Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The tires of a vehicle are used to support the weight of the vehicle and the friction between the tires and the road surface may cause a leakage in air pressure, in particular, when the vehicle is driven at a high speed.
      <br/>
      The excessive bumping of the tires with the road causes the tire pressure to be insufficient.
      <br/>
      However, there is no effective device to detect the condition of the tire pressure.
      <br/>
      If the tires with insufficient pressure are not properly treated or maintained, the tires may be exploded or punctured, and this will endanger the driver.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is a main object of the present invention to provide a tire-safety sensing device which overcome the above drawback.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="10">
      For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiment illustrated in the drawings.
      <br/>
      Specific language will be used to describe same.
      <br/>
      It will, nevertheless, be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated herein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Referring to FIGS. 1 to 3, there is shown a tire-safety sensing device which is used for the front wheel of a vehicle.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, the sensing device comprises a supporting rod 10 having one end connected to the body 9 of the vehicle, located beside the tire b, a fixing peg 12 to pivotally connect the sensing device to a sensing rod 20 to provide a swinging motion, a contacting wheel 21 with a bearing 211 mounted onto the top end of the sensing rod 20, a spring 121 (tortional spring) being mounted to the fixing peg 12, the two ends of the spring 121 being mounted to a protrusion 111 within a notch 11 provided at the supporting rod 10 and a protrusion 22 of the sensing rod 20, the spring 121 urges the sensing rod 20 towards the tire b such that the contacting wheel 21 is in contact with the tire b.
    </p>
    <p num="12">In accordance with the present invention, a micro-switch 13 is mounted on the supporting rod 10, and a conductive wire 131 is connected via the supporting rod 10 to a controlling device (not shown) mounted within the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="13">The bottom end of the sensing rod 20, protruded out of the notch 11, is provided with a protruded block 23 corresponding to the micro-switch 13.</p>
    <p num="14">
      When the tire pressure of the tire b is sufficient, the contacting wheel 21 urges the edge of the tire b and the contacting wheel 211 is in a vertical position.
      <br/>
      At this moment, the protruded block 23 does not contact with the micro-switch 13 positioned at the supporting rod 10.
      <br/>
      Thus, the controlling device (not shown) within the vehicle will not be activated.
      <br/>
      If the tire pressure of the tire b is insufficient (as a result of high speed driving or long period of use of tire b), the edge of the tire b will be reduced and the contacting wheel 21 at the top of the sensing rod 20 will incline towards the direction of the tire b as a result of the spring 121.
      <br/>
      Thus, at this moment the protruded block 23 at the lower section of the sensing rod 20 will contact with the micro-switch 13.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      As shown in FIG. 9, the micro-switch 13 will cause the micro-computer controlling device (not shown) to be activated via the conductive wire 131.
      <br/>
      By simple electronic circuits, the throttle and brake indicator will be activated to provide precautionary action.
      <br/>
      For instance, the throttle is rapidly closed or the brake is applied, or an indicator is lighted to indicate which tire is insufficient in pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIGS. 4, 5 and 6, the tire-safety sensing device is used for the front wheel of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      On the supporting rod 10, a vertical rod body 30 is mounted.
      <br/>
      The rod body 30 is mounted with a swinging element 40 having a bearing 41.
      <br/>
      The swinging element 40 is swingable on the top of the rod body 30.
      <br/>
      A notch 42 is provided at the front section of the swinging element 40 for the mounting of a sensing rod 20.
      <br/>
      The bottom section of the swinging element 40 is provided with a micro-switch 13.
      <br/>
      In addition, the swinging element 40, facing the tire direction, is provided with two elastic top rods 43.
      <br/>
      The top rod 43 is located within a holding member 44 located on the swinging element 40.
      <br/>
      The holding member 44 is provided with a spring 41, and therefore, the top rod 43 can be elastically move out, and the front section of the top rod 43 is provided with a ball body 431 which is in contact with the lateral edge of the wheel having the tire C. The ball body 431 should be positioned in such a way to avoid hindering the rotation of the tire C.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In accordance with the present invention, the two top rods 43 are located at the two lateral sides of the center of the tire C. When the tire C rotates, the top rods 43 are urges and the swinging element 40 swings accordingly such that the sensing rod 40 is always in contact with the edge of the tire C at normal condition and to avoid damage caused to the contacting wheel 21 during rotation.
      <br/>
      When the pressure of tire C is insufficient, the sensing rod 20 will contact with the micro-switch 13 and it will be translated to the controlling device in the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 7, the present sensing device can also be used on truck mounted with tires in parallel arrangement.
      <br/>
      In this case, the wheel cover d1 of the truck is mounted with the sensing device and the pressure of the external tire d can be sensed by the sensing device.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Referring to FIG. 8, for large truck or trailer where there is no wheel cover provided, the body of the vehicle at the top of the tire e is extended with a holding member 50 containing a spring 51 therein, such that a top rod 52 is elastically protruded.
      <br/>
      The top end of the top rod 52 is provided with a wheel 521 which is elastically in contact with the tire e. A micro-switch 53 is mounted to the holding member 50 and a protrusion 522 is located at the circumferential edge of the top rod 52.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Thus, if the tire pressure of tire e is insufficient, the top rod 52 will not move downward and the protrusion 522 will not contact with the micro-switch 53.
      <br/>
      If the tire pressure of the tire e is insufficient, the protrusion 522 will move downward to contact with the micro-switch 53 so as to activate the controlling device within the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="21">It will be understood that each of the elements described above, or two or more together may also find a useful application in other types of methods differing from the type described above.</p>
    <p num="22">While certain novel features of this invention have been shown and described and are pointed out in the annexed claim, it is not intended to be limited to the details above, since it will be understood that various omissions, modifications, substitutions and changes in the forms and details of the device illustrated and in its operation can be made by those skilled in the art without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
