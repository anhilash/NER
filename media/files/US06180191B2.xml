    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to plasma processing and in particular to a method and apparatus for plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition of a thin film onto the interior surface of a container.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Traditionally, containers for chemically sensitive materials have been made from inorganic materials such as glass.
      <br/>
      Glass containers offer the advantage that they are substantially impenetrable by atmospheric gases and thus provide a product with a long shelf life.
      <br/>
      Glass containers are also readily recyclable.
      <br/>
      However, glass containers are heavy and expensive to manufacture.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      More recently, lighter and less expensive containers made of polymeric materials are being used in applications where traditionally glass containers were used.
      <br/>
      These polymeric containers are less suspectable to breakage, are less expensive to manufacture, are lighter and less expensive to ship than glass containers.
      <br/>
      Further, polymeric containers can be made transparent thus allowing the contents of the container to be readily viewed by a consumer before the product is purchased.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, polymeric containers are not without disadvantages.
      <br/>
      One significant disadvantage is that polymeric containers are ordinarily highly permeable to gases.
      <br/>
      This high permeability to gases allows atmospheric gases to pass through the polymeric container to the packaged product and also allows gases in the packaged product to escape through the polymeric container, both of which undesirably degrade the quality and shelf life of the packaged product.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One approach to decrease the gas permeability of polymeric containers is to form a multilayered polymeric container which includes at least one low gas permeable polymeric layer along with at least one other polymeric layer.
      <br/>
      However, such an approach is relatively complicated, costly and often produces a container which is difficult to recycle.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another approach to decrease the gas permeability of polymeric containers is to deposit a barrier coating, i.e. a coating having a substantial resistance to the permeation of gaseous or volatile material, on the polymeric container.
      <br/>
      To date however, there are several obstacles which have prevented barrier coated polymeric containers from gaining wide acceptance.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      One obstacle which has inhibited the use of barrier coated polymeric containers is that conventional barrier coating deposition techniques are not well suited for mass production.
      <br/>
      To illustrate, in Thomas et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,510 a method and apparatus for depositing barrier coatings on the interior surface of a polymeric container is presented.
      <br/>
      However, in Thomas et al., a tubular plasma chamber 46 with downstream extension 52, adaptor 50, tube 54 and coaxial conduit are employed to convert an oxidizing gas into a plasma and to deliver the activated oxidizing gas species separately from organosilicon vapor to the vicinity of the article to be coated (see col. 6, lines 46-67 and FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      Thus, although Thomas et al. demonstrates the feasibility of depositing a barrier coating on an article, the tubular plasma chamber and associated equipment are relatively expensive and complex and thus are not well suited to the production environment.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Another obstacle which has inhibited the use of barrier coated polymeric containers is the difficulty associated with depositing a uniform barrier coating.
      <br/>
      Generally, it is preferable to deposit a uniform barrier coating on the polymeric container to ensure that the entire polymeric container provides an effective gas permeation barrier.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      One conventional technique to improve the uniformity of the deposited barrier coating is to rotate the container during processing.
      <br/>
      To illustrate, in Thomas et al. at col. 9, lines 14-20 the polymeric container is rotated during the deposition of the barrier coating to promote the even distribution of the barrier coating on the interior surface of the polymeric container.
      <br/>
      However, as rotation of the polymeric container is accomplished using an additional motor which rotates a shaft extending into the chamber through an air to vacuum feedthrough, rotation of the polymeric container further increases the cost and decreases the reliability of the barrier coating deposition process.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Accordingly, the art needs a simple, inexpensive and reliable process for depositing a barrier coating on a polymeric container.
      <br/>
      The process should have a fast cycle time to accommodate production demands.
      <br/>
      Further, the barrier coating deposited should have good uniformity without the necessity of rotating the polymeric container and the barrier coated polymeric container should be readily recyclable.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">In accordance with the present invention, a method and apparatus for depositing a thin film onto a surface of a container is presented.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The apparatus includes a chamber made of an electrically insulating material.
      <br/>
      Located adjacent an exterior surface of the chamber is a main electrode.
      <br/>
      Extending into the chamber is a counter electrode which is a hollow tube that also serves as a gas inlet.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The chamber is sealed on a first end with a chamber door and on a second end with a face plate.
      <br/>
      The face plate is fitted with a vent port capable of being connected to a vent valve and with a pressure port capable of being connected to a pressure measuring device.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The apparatus further includes a pumping plenum attached on a first end to the face plate and a T-coupler attached on a first end to a second end of the pumping plenum.
      <br/>
      The counter electrode extends through the pumping plenum and through the T-coupler.
      <br/>
      A vacuum seal is formed between the counter electrode and a second end of the T-coupler.
      <br/>
      The T-coupler is made of an electrically insulating material thus electrically isolating the counter electrode from the pumping plenum, the face plate and the chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Also coupled to the T-coupler is a vacuum pump which is capable of creating a vacuum inside of the chamber.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The face plate also has a gas inlet port connected to a first process gas source.
      <br/>
      A first flow controller is coupled between the gas inlet port and the first process gas source.
      <br/>
      The first flow controller has the capability of controlling the flow of gas from the first process gas source to the chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Connected to the counter electrode is a second process gas source.
      <br/>
      The second process gas source includes a first gas component source and a second gas component source.
      <br/>
      To control the flow of gas from the first gas component source to the counter electrode, a second flow controller is coupled between the counter electrode and the first gas component source.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The second gas component source is a container of organosilicon liquid.
      <br/>
      A vaporizer/flowcontroller system (VF system) is provided to vaporize the organosilicon liquid into organosilicon vapor and to control the flowrate of the organosilicon vapor generated.
      <br/>
      The VF system includes a first valve, a second valve and a capillary tube coupled on a first end to the first valve and on a second end to the second valve.
      <br/>
      The capillary tube has an inside diameter typically in the range of 0.001 inches to 0.010 inches.
      <br/>
      The first valve is also coupled to the counter electrode and the second valve is also coupled to a liquid line which is inserted into the container of organosilicon liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Also connected to the counter electrode is a pressurized gas source.
      <br/>
      By opening an ejection shutoff valve connected between the pressurized gas source and the counter electrode, the counter electrode is flushed with compressed gas.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The main electrode and counter electrode are powered by an alternating current (AC) power supply which preferably has an output frequency of 13.56 megahertz (MHz).</p>
    <p num="22">
      To allow a container to be readily mounted in the chamber, a mandrel is mounted on the counter electrode.
      <br/>
      The mandrel has a lip on to which the container can be mounted.
      <br/>
      Extending through the mandrel are one or more gas outlet ports which allow process gas to flow from the interior to the exterior of the container.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Mounted on a first end of the counter electrode is a gas nozzle.
      <br/>
      The gas nozzle has an inside diameter larger than an outside diameter of the counter electrode thus allowing a portion of the counter electrode to fit inside of the gas nozzle.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In accordance with the present invention, a method for depositing a coating on the interior surface of a container is also presented.
      <br/>
      The method includes mounting the container in the chamber and then evacuating the chamber.
      <br/>
      A first process gas is introduced into a first region exterior to the container and a second process gas is introduced through a gas inlet into a second region interior to the container.
      <br/>
      The gas inlet also serves as the counter electrode.
      <br/>
      The first and second process gases are then ionized by coupling AC power, typically RF power, to the main electrode adjacent the exterior surface of the chamber and to the gas inlet to deposit the coating on the interior surface of the container.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In this embodiment, the first process gas is helium and the second process gas is a gas mixture which includes oxygen and an organosilicon vapor.
      <br/>
      The process gases are ionized for 1 to 300 seconds and typically for 5 to 15 seconds.
      <br/>
      After the coating is deposited on the interior surface of the container, the chamber is vented and the container is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The deposited coating provides an excellent gas permeation barrier.
      <br/>
      Further, since the coating is deposited on the interior surface of the container, the coating is not subject to abrasion during shipment and handling of the container as compared to exterior surface of the container.
      <br/>
      Also, by forming the coating on the interior surface of the container, degradation of the product within the container from direct interactions between the product and the container is prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Further, the coating is uniformly deposited without the necessity of rotating the container.
      <br/>
      Since the barrier coating is typically 1000 angstroms or less, the barrier coating represents a very small fraction of the material of the container, thus allowing the container to be readily recycled.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The cycle time, typically of 5 to 15 seconds, is well suited for mass production of barrier coated containers.
      <br/>
      In addition, the apparatus is simple to operate, is relatively inexpensive to manufacture and needs little servicing.
    </p>
    <p num="29">These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the preferred embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="31">In accordance with the present invention, a method and apparatus for plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition of a thin film onto a surface of a container in presented.</p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a container interior surface coating (CISC) reactor system 10 having a container 12 mounted inside of a cylindrical chamber 14 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Chamber 14 is made of an insulating material such as quartz although other insulating materials such as alumina or plastic can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In this embodiment, the length of chamber 14, i.e. the distance from a first end 14A to a second end 14B of chamber 14, is 8.7 inches (in.) and the inside diameter of chamber 14 is 7.75 in. Generally, the inside diameter of chamber 14 is larger than the largest outside diameter of container 12.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the inside diameter of chamber 14 is at least 30% larger than the largest outside diameter of container 12.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Chamber 14 is fitted on first end 14A with a door 16 which can be opened and closed to allow access to the interior of chamber 14.
      <br/>
      When door 16 is closed, i.e. when door 16 is in contact with end 14A as shown in FIG. 1, a vacuum seal is formed between door 16 and second end 14A using conventional means such as by locating an O-ring between door 16 and end 14A.
      <br/>
      A second end 14B of chamber 14 is vacuum sealed with a face plate 18 also using conventional techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      A pumping plenum 20 is concentrically attached on a first end to face plate 18.
      <br/>
      Pumping plenum 20 is also attached on a second end to a vacuum pump 22 by a T-coupler 24.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, vacuum pump 22 is a conventional single or 2-stage rotary type mechanical pump which is set up for oxygen service. (Oxygen service typically requires the use of a fluorinated vacuum pump oil.) T-coupler 24 is made of an electrically insulating material such as teflon or another polymeric material although other electrically insulating materials such as ceramic can be used. T-coupler 24 is a Cole Parmer (Niles, Ill.) part -H-06482-88 Teflon PFA NPT (F) tee or a MDC Vacuum Product, Inc. (Hayward, Calif.) part -728007 PVC Tee with KF50 flanges (part -728007) for nominal 1.5 in. PVC pipe.
      <br/>
      During use, vacuum pump 22 removes gas from the inside of chamber 14 via pumping plenum 20 and T-coupler 24 thereby reducing the pressure within chamber 14 to a subatmospheric pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The pressure within chamber 14 is measured by a pressure transducer 26 which is exposed to the interior of chamber 14 at a pressure port 28 of face plate 18.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a capacitance manometer or a thermocouple gauge can be used in place of pressure transducer 26.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      A vent valve 30 is also exposed to the interior of chamber 14 at a vent port 32 of face plate 18.
      <br/>
      When chamber 14 is at a subatmospheric pressure, vent valve 30 can be opened allowing air to be drawn into chamber 14 through vacuum port 32 thereby bringing the pressure within chamber 14 up to atmospheric pressure.
      <br/>
      Vent valve 30 can be plumbed (not shown) to an inert gas such as nitrogen thus allowing chamber 14 to be vented with an inert gas.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Process gases can be fed into chamber 14 in at least two locations.
      <br/>
      In particular, a first process gas is introduced into chamber 14 in a region 36 exterior to container 12 through a gas inlet port 34 of face plate 18.
      <br/>
      A second process gas is introduced into chamber 14 in a region 38 interior to container 12 through a gas inlet 40.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The first process gas is provided to region 36 from a first process gas source 42 which is typically a standard compressed gas cylinder.
      <br/>
      Generally, the first process gas has a low mass and a very high ionization potential.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment the first process gas is helium, although other gases such as hydrogen (H2), argon (Ar), Neon (Ne) or Krypton (Kr) can be used.
      <br/>
      Source 42 is coupled to gas inlet port 34 via a pressure regulator 44, a gas line 46, a gas flowmeter 48 and a gas line 50.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      During use, regulator 44 reduces the pressure of the first process gas (which is at a relatively high pressure inside of source 42) and delivers the first process gas at a reduced pressure to gas line 46.
      <br/>
      The first process gas flows from regulator 44 through gas line 46 to gas flowmeter 48.

      Gas flowmeter 48 functions to control the on/off flow of the first process gas and also functions to control the volumetric flow rate of the first process gas to chamber 14.

      In this embodiment, gas flowmeter 48 includes a conventional shutoff valve 47 (such as a ball valve) which is the on/off control for the first process gas and a conventional metering valve 49 (such as a needle valve) which controls the flowrate of the first process gas.

      Metering valve 49 is adjusted manually to increase or decrease an internal orifice of metering valve 49 thereby to increase or decrease, respectively, the volumetric flow rate of the first process gas.

      Source 52 is a container of organosilicon liquid.
      <br/>
      Suitable organosilicon liquids include siloxanes such as hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO), 1, 1, 3, 3-tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDSO), and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane; alkoxysilanes such as amyltriethoxysilane, ethyltriethoxysilane, isobutyltriethoxysilane, and tetramethoxysilane; silazanes such as hexamethyldisilazane; and fluorine-containing silanes such as trimethyfluorosilane.
      <br/>
      The container of source 52 preferably has a cover to prevent contaminants from falling into the reservoir of organosilicon liquid.
      <br/>
      However, to allow the organosilicon liquid to be removed from source 52 by liquid line 68, air (or another gas such as nitrogen) must be allowed to enter source 52 as the organosilicon liquid is removed.

      Since source 54 is generally a reactive gas, and typically an oxidizing gas such as oxygen, pressure regulator 56, gas line 58, gas flowmeter 60 and gas line 62 are manufactured to service oxidizing gases as those skilled in the art will understand.
      <br/>
      During use, regulator 56 reduces the pressure of the first gas component (which is at a relatively high pressure inside of source 54) and delivers the first gas component at a reduced pressure to gas line 58.

      In particular, gas flowmeter 60 includes a shutoff valve 59 and a metering valve 61.

      VF system 64 includes a liquid shutoff valve 66, a metering valve 72 and a capillary tube 70 coupled on a first end to valve 66 and on a second end to valve 72.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, shutoff valve 66 is coupled to the liquid line 68 which extends into the reservoir of organosilicon liquid in source 52.

      Metering valve 72 is coupled to gas inlet 40 by a gas line 74.

      Although the present invention is not limited by any theory of operation, it is believed that VF system 64 operates as follows.

      When CISC reactor system 10 is initially setup, capillary tube 70 and liquid line 68 contain air and are at atmospheric pressure.
      <br/>
      Liquid line 68 is then inserted into the organosilicon liquid reservoir in source 52.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      As described in more detail below, chamber 14 is then evacuated by vacuum pump 22 which creates a vacuum in gas inlet 40.
      <br/>
      Metering valve 72 is then opened slightly, creating a corresponding vacuum in capillary tube 70.
      <br/>
      Shutoff valve 66 is then opened to draw the organosilicon liquid from source 52 through liquid line 68 into capillary tube 70.
      <br/>
      The inner diameter and length of liquid line 68 are selected such that, after organosilicon liquid is drawn into capillary tube 70, no air remains in liquid line 68, i.e. that liquid line 68 is filled with purely organosilicon liquid.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the inner diameter and length of liquid line 68 are less than or equal to 0.125 in. and 3.0 feet, respectively.

      In one embodiment, the inner diameter and length of liquid line 68 are 1/32 in. (0.031 in.) and 2.0 feet, respectively.

      At this point, liquid line 68 and capillary tube 70 are filled with purely organosilicon liquid (no air).
      <br/>
      In particular, capillary tube 70 holds a predetermined amount of organosilicon liquid which is determined by the length and inside diameter of capillary tube 70.

      As described in more detail below, during processing of container 12, a vacuum is created in gas inlet 40.

      Metering valve 72 is then opened thereby drawing some of the organosilicon liquid out of capillary tube 70 into the subatmospheric pressure region of gas inlet 40.
      <br/>
      As the organosilicon liquid is exposed to the subatmospheric pressure, the organosilicon liquid boils thus producing organosilicon vapor.
      <br/>
      This continues until all of the organosilicon liquid in capillary tube 70 has been converted into organosilicon vapor.
      <br/>
      Since the amount of organosilicon vapor produced directly depends upon the amount of organosilicon liquid initially present in capillary tube 70 (which is predetermined), a fixed amount of organosilicon vapor is delivered from capillary tube 70.
      <br/>
      The flow rate at which the organosilicon vapor is delivered is controlled by adjusting metering valve 72.

      After the organosilicon liquid in capillary tube 70 is exhausted, metering valve 72 is closed thus leaving a vacuum in capillary tube 70.

      Liquid shutoff valve 66 is then closed and VF system 64 is ready to deliver another fixed amount of organosilicon vapor to gas inlet 40.

      <br/>
      During use, regulator 78 reduces the pressure of the compressed gas and delivers the compressed gas at a reduced pressure to gas line 80.

      A main electrode 86 is provided adjacent the exterior surface of chamber 14.

      Main electrode 86 can be fashioned in a variety of shapes.

      For example, main electrode 86 can be a continuous coil or can be a plurality of separate cylindrical sections.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, main electrode 86 is made of copper and is in the shape of a continuous cylinder.
      <br/>
      To allow main electrode 86 to fit over chamber 14, the inside diameter of main electrode 86 is slightly larger then the outside diameter of chamber 14.
      <br/>
      Preferably, main electrode 86 fits tightly over chamber 14.
      <br/>
      In this manner, any gap between main electrode 86 and chamber 14 is minimized and the power coupling efficiency from main electrode 86 to process gas within chamber 14 is maximized.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Main electrode 86 is powered by a conventional power supply 88.

      Power supply 88 is generally an alternating current (AC) power supply and preferably operates at 13.56 megahertz (MHz) output frequency (typically referred to as a radio frequency or RF power supply).
      <br/>
      To match the impedance of power supply 88 to the impedance of the process, a matching network 90 is coupled between power supply 88 and main electrode 86.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the output impedance of power supply 88 is 50 ohms and matching network 90 is a conventional LC type matching network.
      <br/>
      For example, power supply 88 is a 250 watt, 13.56 MHz generator available from RF Plasma Products and matching network 90 is the corresponding matching network also available from RF Plasma Products.
      <br/>
      To complete the electrical circuit, power supply 88 is also electrically coupled to gas inlet 40 which, in addition to delivering the second process gas to region 38, operates as a counter electrode for power supply 88.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      To allow gas inlet 40 to operate as a counter electrode, gas inlet 40 is made of an electrically conductive material.

      Since T-coupler 24 is made of an electrically insulating material, gas inlet 40 is electrically isolated from chamber 14, pumping plenum 20, face plate 18 and the associated components.

      Further, gas lines 62, 74 and 84 are typically formed from an electrically insulating material such as plastic thus electrically isolating gas inlet 40 from sources 52, 54, 76 and the associated gas delivery systems.

      However, it is understood that other configurations can be used to electrically isolate gas inlet 40 from sources 52, 54 and 76.

      <br/>
      The diameter of the central aperture through mandrel 92 through which gas inlet 40 extends is slightly larger than the outside diameter of gas inlet 40 to provide a friction fit between mandrel 92 and gas inlet 40.

      Generally, gas nozzle 110 has an inside diameter larger than the outside diameter of gas inlet 40 to allow gas inlet 40 to extend into gas nozzle 110 as shown in FIG. 2.

      Further, the significant ion bombardment causes gas inlet 40 and gas nozzle 110 to become heated.
      <br/>
      This heats the interior surface of container 12 which densifies the deposited coating and enhances the barrier properties of the deposited coating.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      Further, the high voltage on gas inlet 40 and gas nozzle 110 causes both the first and second gas components of the second process gas to be ionized simultaneously inside of gas nozzle 110 before being discharged to and further ionized in region 38 outside of gas nozzle 110.
      <br/>
      This causes the second process gas to be highly activated (to have a high degree of ionization) throughout region 38 thus enhancing the uniformity of the coating deposited on the interior surface of container 12.

      After a predetermined amount of time, generally 1 to 300 seconds and typically 5 to 15 seconds, power supply 88, the first and second process gas flows and mechanical pump 22 are shut off.
      <br/>
      To shut off the first and second process gases, shutoff valves 47, 59 and metering valve 72 are closed.
      <br/>
      It is understood that the organosilicon liquid in capillary tube 70 may be completely vaporized before metering valve 72 is closed and thus the flow of the organosilicon vapor may have ceased before metering valve 72 is closed.
      <br/>
      Chamber 14 is then vented to atmospheric pressure by opening vent valve 30.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      When chamber 14 reaches atmospheric pressure as measured by pressure transducer 26, door 16 is opened.
      <br/>
      Ejection shutoff valve 82 is then opened thus providing a blast of compressed gas through gas inlet 40.
      <br/>
      This blast of compressed gas ejects container 12 from mandrel 92.
      <br/>
      This blast of compressed gas also serves to remove any particulates from the interior of gas inlet 40 and gas nozzle 110 essentially eliminating any pinhole or other particulate defects of the barrier coating deposited on the interior surface of the succeeding container.
      <br/>
      At this point, a new container is loaded on to mandrel 92 and processed.

    <p num="80">
      FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of container 12 having a barrier coating 112 deposited on the interior surface of container 12 in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      By depositing barrier coating 112 on the interior surface of container 12, abrasion of barrier coating 112 during handling and shipment is essentially eliminated in contrast to a barrier coating formed on the exterior surface of container 12.
      <br/>
      Further, in the case of highly sensitive products, forming barrier coating 112 on the interior surface of container 12 prevents degradation of the product from direct interactions between the product and container 12. (Conversely, a barrier coating on the exterior surface of container 12 offers no protection from direct interaction between the product and container 12.)
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      In this embodiment where the organosilicon liquid is HMDSO and the first component of the second process gas is oxygen, the resultant barrier coating 112 is primarily a silicon oxide (SiOx) thin film which typically contains a small percentage of carbon and/or hydrogen.
      <br/>
      However, in other embodiments, nitrogen or fluorine can be incorporated into barrier coating 112 for example by using a nitrogen containing organosilicon liquid such as hexamethydisilazane or a fluorine containing organosilicon liquid such as trimethyfluorosilane, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Alternatively, instead of using an organosilicon liquid, source 52 (FIG. 1) can be a hydrocarbon such as methane or propane.
      <br/>
      In this alternative, the resultant barrier coating 112 (FIG. 4) is a thin film primarily containing carbon.
      <br/>
      As another alternative, source 52 (FIG. 1) can be an organometallic such as tetramethyltin.
      <br/>
      In this alternative, the resultant barrier coating 112 (FIG. 4) is a metal containing thin film.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Further, in other embodiments, the first gas component of the second process gas can be a gas other than oxygen.
      <br/>
      Generally, the first gas component of the second process gas is a reactive gas.
      <br/>
      For example, the first gas component is a fluorine-based compound such as carbon tetrafluoride (CF4).
      <br/>
      Examples of other suitable fluorine-based compounds include: aliphatic fluorohydrocarbons such as perfluorotetradecane; aromatic fluorohydrocarbons such as fluorobenzene; benzotrifluorides such as 3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl alcohol; fluroalkenes/alkynes such as hexafluoropropene trimer; (Meth)acrylate monomers such as hexafluoroisopropyl acrylate; fluoroalcohols and phenols such as hexafluoroisopropanol; fluorine-containing ethers such as trifluoromethoxy benzene; fluorine-containing ketones such as hexafluoracetone; fluoroacids and anhydrides such as difluoroacetic acid; fluoroaldehydes such as pentafluorobenzaldehyde; fluoroesters such as ethyl trifluoroacetate; fluorine containing nitriles such as pentafluorobenzonitrile; inorganic fluorine compounds such as silver fluoride; and fluorine-containing silanes such as trimethylfluorosilane.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Further, the first gas component of the second process gas can be another gas such as nitrogen (N2), nitrous oxide (N2 O) or an organometallic such as tetramethyltin.
      <br/>
      Further, the first gas component can itself be a gas mixture, for example can be a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen.

      Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, persons skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

      For example, the invention can be used to deposit a coating on other three dimensional objects made of a variety of materials, for example can be used to deposit a coating on a metallic beverage can.
