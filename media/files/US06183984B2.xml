      <br/>
      The present disclosure provides a detailed characterization of the sequences and factors controlling expression of a human gene expressed specifically in keratinocytes.
      <br/>
      Using 5' upstream sequence of the human K14 keratin gene coupled to one of two reporter genes, sequences necessary and sufficient for expression of K14 have been examined in both cultured human keratinocytes and in mitotically active basal keratinocytes of transgenic mouse epidermis.
      <br/>
      The existence of distal and proximal elements located 5' from the transcription initiation site of the hK14 gene is demonstrated, which when combined with a TATA box element, appear to act in concert to drive keratinocyte-specific expression.
      <br/>
      The proximal element was also examined.
      <br/>
      After using CAT assays to narrow the transcriptional activation element to within 110 bp, the existence of a keratinocyte nuclear factor was determined, termed KER1 (AP2), which binds to the 10 bp palindromic sequence, 5' G C C T G C A G G C 3', within this domain.
      <br/>
      The data suggest that both the sequence and the nuclear factor that has been identified are involved, in conjunction with a distal element (-1700 to -2100 of the human K14 gene) in controlling keratinocyte-specific expression in vitro and in vivo.

    <p num="6">
      Keratinocytes are cells found exclusively in stratified squamous epithelia, including epidermis, tongue, esophagus, cervix and cornea (for review, see Watt, 1988).
      <br/>
      As surface and lining cells, keratinocytes have several unusual structural features in common, including (a) 10 nm keratin intermediate filaments (IFs), which constitute a major part of the keratinocyte cytoskeleton, (b) desmosomes, which are membranous plaques responsible for interconnecting keratinocytes as a cellular sheet, and (c) a group of inner membrane envelope proteins, which become covalently cross-linked by transglutaminase when keratinocytes undergo terminal differentiation.
      <br/>
      In addition, differentiating keratinocytes are the natural cell type-specific hosts for a family of circular, double-stranded DNA viruses known as papillomaviruses, although expression of HPV genes has also been detected in relatively undifferentiated cervical carcinomas in vivo as well as simple epithelial-like cervical carcinoma cells in vitro (for a review, see Broker and Botchan, 1986).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Despite minor differences, mitotically active keratinocytes from different stratified squamous epithelial tissues appear to be quite similar not only in morphology but also in biochemistry (Nelson and Sun, 1983).
      <br/>
      The major proteins expressed by these cells are a pair of keratins, K5 (58 kd) and K14 (5 kd), which form the 10 nm cytoskeletal filaments (Nelson and Sun, 1983; Eichner et al., 1986).
      <br/>
      In differentiating keratinocytes, the major proteins are also keratins, but in this case, the keratins are expressed in a tissue-specific fashion (for reviews, see Moll et al., 1982; Sun et al., 1984).
      <br/>
      For epidermis, terminally differentiating cells in vivo express keratins K1 (67 kd) and K10 (56.5 kd) (Fuchs and Green, 1980; Moll et al., 1982; Roop et al., 1983), and suprabasal cells in vitro express K6 (56 kd) and K16 (48 kd) (Kopan and Fuchs, 1989).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of genes in basal keratinocytes or the processes controlling changes in keratin and viral gene expression during keratinocyte differentiation.
      <br/>
      However, a number of recent studies have begun to focus on identifying putative regulatory domains and transcription factors which might be involved in expression of either endogenous or viral genes in keratinocytes (Marchuk et al., 1985; Blessing et al., 1987; 1989; Cripe et al., 1987; Hirochika et al., 1988; Vassar et al., 1989; Chin et al., 1989; Jiang et al., 1990).
      <br/>
      For papillomaviruses, assessing the relevance to keratinocyte-specific gene expression has been complicated because (a) the viral genomes encode proteins which influence transcription of viral genes and (b) even though HPV genes are preferentially expressed in keratinocytes in vivo, most in vitro studies have been carried out with HeLa or C-33A cells, both of which appear to be relatively undifferentiated, simple epithelial-like cervical carcinoma cells that do not express most keratinocyte-specific structural proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Given this caveat, several HPV genes have been shown to contain sequences (defined to limits as small as .about.30-100 bp) which are not only required for viral expression but also bind epithelial-specific proteins (Cripe et al., 1987; Swift et al., 1987; Gloss et al., 1987; Hirochika et al., 1988; Gius et al., 1988; Chin et al., 1989).
      <br/>
      In contrast, for genes expressed naturally in keratinocytes, only coarsely defined regulatory domains (300 bp or greater) have thus far been identified (Vassar et al., 1989; Blessing et al., 1989; Jiang et al., 1990).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In the absence of molecular studies, the 5' upstream sequences of a number of genes expressed specifically in keratinocytes have been screened for similarities which might provide clues as to sequences which might be important for gene expression (Marchuk et al., 1985; Tyner et al., 1985; Johnson et al., 1985; Blessing et al., 1987; Lersch et al., 1989).
      <br/>
      From these comparisons, several putative regulatory sequences have been postulated based upon either extensive similarities to known viral enhancer sequences, e.g. the SV40 core enhancer (Marchuk et al., 1985), the widespread occurrence of a sequence, e.g. the CK 8-mer consensus sequence 5' A A N C C A A A 3' (Blessing et al., 1987; Cripe et al., 1987), or the conservation of a sequence, e.g. 5' T G C A G G T G T G A 3' (SEQ ID NO:2) among two closely related genes (Lersch et al., 1989).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Since so little is known about the sequences and transcription factors involved in keratinocyte-specific expression, the extent to which such comparisons will prove to be valid is almost wholly unknown.
      <br/>
      Among the questions which remain to be answered are: Is there a common regulatory mechanism controlling expression of a large number of keratinocyte-specific genes? Are papillomavirus and keratinocyte genes regulated in similar fashions? Are the same transcription factors recruited to control gene expression in dividing and differentiating keratinocytes? Clearly, elucidating sequences necessary for keratinocyte-specific gene expression and purification of the proteins which interact with these sequences is a prerequisite to understanding transcription of genes in keratinocytes.
      <br/>
      To begin to investigate cell type-specific expression in keratinocytes, the functional human genes encoding K14 have been isolated and characterized (Marchuk et al., 1985) and K5 (Lersch et al., 1989).
      <br/>
      Not only do these genes encode the major keratinocyte proteins, but in embryogenesis, their expression is upregulated coincident with the commitment of an embryonic basal cell to an epidermal fate (Kopan and Fuchs, 1989).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Previously, it has been reported that a human K14 gene construct containing .about.2300 bp of 5' upstream sequence gave specific expression in the basal layers of stratified squamous epithelia in transgenic mice (Vassar et al., 1989).
      <br/>
      However, this previous study failed to identify the specific regions or nucleotide sequences that might be responsible for conferring specific expression.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this information does not allow one the ability to multimerize and/or employ smaller sequences and factors that play a role in mediating epithelial-specific expression.
      <br/>
      These smaller, specific sequences could be used to confer specific expression without resort to the 2300 bp sequence reported by Vassar et al.
      <br/>
      In addition, multimerization of these sequences might be used to create more powerful expression without loss of tissue specificity.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there is a continuing need for the identification of the precise sequences controlling epithelial-specific gene expression.
      <br/>
      Moreover, there is a need for the identification of the actual stretches of nucleotides responsible for mediating the specificity, as well as a need for the development of control regions having an improved mediating capability.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      In its most general and overall scope, the present invention is directed to DNA segments which, when located upstream from and proximal to a transcription initiation site of a selected structural gene, serve to confer a keratinocyte specific, and often epidermal abundant, expression capability to such a gene.
      <br/>
      These DNA segments have been identified and constructed from a consideration and manipulation of DNA sequences found in the gene regions upstream of keratinocyte-specific genes, such as used herein, the term "upstream" refers to DNA sequences found in a 5' direction from a given point of reference along a DNA molecule.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Most importantly and surprisingly, it has been found that the keratinocyte specific control elements of the present invention are functionally translocatable to other structural genes.
      <br/>
      Thus, when these elements are located upstream of a selected heterologous structural gene, keratinocyte-specific regulation is conferred to this "hybrid" gene.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as used herein, the term "functionally translocatable" refers to genetic elements which retain their functional capability in contexts other than their natural state, and the term "hybrid" gene refers to a man-made gene constructed through the application of recombinant DNA techniques to bring together genetic elements not normally associated in nature.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the term "heterologous structural gene" refers to structural genes other than the naturally-associated gene, and the term "structural gene" refers to any DNA segment which may be both transcribed and translated by a cell.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Accordingly, in a general sense, the invention is directed to purified segments of DNA comprising functionally translocatable keratinocyte transcription elements capable of conferring regulation of structural gene transcription to a selected heterologous structural gene when located upstream from and proximal to a transcription initiation site of such a gene, generally provided that said segment is free of the structural gene ordinarily under the transcriptional control of said proximal and distal element sequences.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The proximal element can be defined as including a nucleotide sequence comprising:
      <br/>
      5'-G-C-C-T-G-C-A-G-G-C-3'  (SEQ ID NO:1)
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      or the complement of such a sequence.
      <br/>
      To confer keratinocyte specificity, proximal elements including such sequences must be combined both with a distal element and a TATA box.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Generally, it is proposed that sequence stretches of on the order of 10 to 1500, more preferably 10 to 1000, and still more preferably 10 to 100 nucleotides in length, which incorporate the foregoing proximal, distal and TATA box elements, will be preferred for conferring keratinocyte-specific regulation.
      <br/>
      In fact, the inventor proposes that even shorter segments of the proximal element, on the order of 10 to 30 nucleotides in length, may be used for conferring such control in combination with the other elements.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In further aspects, the present invention relates to discreet DNA segments represented by the formula:
      <br/>
      Distal Element-(X)n -TATA
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      wherein TATA is a TATA box sequence; n &gt;= 1; and each X is:
      <br/>
      5'-G-C-C-T-G-C-A-G-G-C-3'  (SEQ ID NO:1)
    </p>
    <p num="21">and with each X unit, if more than one, being separated by from 0-200 nucleotides selected from the group of nucleotides consisting of A, G, C and T.</p>
    <p num="22">
      The distal region of the keratinocyte transcriptional element of the present invention operates in conjunction with the proximal element palindrome, G-C-C-T-G-C-A-G-G-C (SEQ ID NO:1), to confer keratinocyte specific gene expression.
      <br/>
      The distal element comprises 300-400 nucleotides from a region located approximately 1700 to 2100 nucleotides upstream from the transcriptional start site, i.e. the -1700 to -2100 nucleotides, of the human K14 gene.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      To obtain a DNA sequence containing the distal element, one would simply prepare a DNA segment comprising the nucleotides in the region located 1700 to 2100 nucleotides upstream from the transcriptional start site of the human K14 gene, i.e. nucleotides between -1700 and -2100.
      <br/>
      This can be achieved, for example, by employing restriction enzymes to excise an appropriate piece of DNA.
      <br/>
      Any one, or two, of an extensive range of restriction enzymes could be chosen following an analysis of the sequences around broadly around -1700 and -2100 to determine the existence of appropriate restriction sites.
      <br/>
      If desired, for example, for subsequent ligation strategies, one could even create a particular restriction site by genetic engineering.
      <br/>
      The use of such restriction enzymes to excise a portion of DNA will be generally known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      It is proposed that the distal and proximal sequences of the present invention may confer a regulatory capability regardless of their orientation with respect to the transcribed strand of DNA.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is proposed that there may not necessarily be a requirement that these sequences be placed in a particular position with respect to the site of transcription initiation.
      <br/>
      Thus, they may act in a fashion similar to enhancer elements in this regard.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      It is also proposed that the elements may be introduced into a heterologous gene in multiple copies, either in a forward or reversed orientation, and perhaps obtain a much improved regulatory capability.
      <br/>
      Moreover, multiple units need not be placed in an adjacent conformation and may be separated by numerous random nucleotides and still retain their improved regulatory and promotion capability.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      As noted, regulatory elements are advantageously employed by locating said sequences upstream from and proximal to a transcription initiation site of a selected heterologous structural gene.
      <br/>
      Depending on the particular structural gene employed, these control elements may provide some benefit when located up to 300 nucleotides upstream of a transcription initiation site, as measured from the 3' end of the control sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="27">However, in a preferred embodiment, the sequences are located within 250 nucleotides of transcription initiation.</p>
    <p num="28">
      It is contemplated that the control sequences will prove useful in the context of a wide array of genes which have been characterized to date.
      <br/>
      Although, as disclosed in more detail below, it is believed that the sequences will prove useful in the context of virtually any structural gene, it is further believed that these sequences will be of particular benefit in the context of human and related structural genes such as the genes for TGFA and other growth factors, EGFR and other growth factor receptors, p53 and other tumor suppressor genes, interferon, lymphokines such as interleukins I, VI and VIII, tumor necrosis factor, and numerous other genes as disclosed herein.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      It is an additional object of the present invention to provide control sequences which may be combined with known promoters to provide novel hybrid eukaryotic promoters having regulatory capabilities.
      <br/>
      Such hybrid promoters may also be employed in the context of selected heterologous structural genes.
    </p>
    <p num="30">It is, therefore, a particular object of the invention to provide a DNA molecule which has incorporated within its structure one or more of the DNA sequences or segments having distal and proximal regulatory elements such as described above, in combination with a structural gene not ordinarily under the transcriptional control of said elements, said structural gene and regulatory elements being combined in a manner such that said structural gene is under the transcriptional control of said regulatory elements.</p>
    <p num="31">
      However, in certain embodiments, the invention will not be limited to use with heterologous structural genes.
      <br/>
      The present disclosure, thus, additionally provides a method for keratinocyte regulation of expression of a polypeptide in recombinant cell culture or in transgenic animals.
      <br/>
      These methods both include the following initial steps of:
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      (a) preparing a first DNA segment which includes the proximal regulatory elements as described above;
      <br/>
      (b) constructing a second DNA segment from said first DNA segment by positioning thereon 1 or more copies of said first DNA segment upstream from and proximal to a transcription initiation site of a selected structural gene such that said structural gene may be brought under the transcriptional control of the regulatory element of said first DNA segment; and
      <br/>
      (c) constructing a third DNA segment from said first DNA segment by positioning thereon one or more copies of the distal regulatory element as described above (-2100 to -1700) upstream from and proximal to the second DNA segment.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Of course, the order of construction of a DNA segment which contains these control elements is not of particular importance, so long as it ultimately includes the proximal and distal elements positioned upstream of the selected structural gene.
      <br/>
      Once constructed, a third DNA segment such as described above can then be employed to regulate the expression of said selected structural gene either in recombinant cell culture or in transgenic animals, by employing the following steps:
      <br/>
      (d) transforming a host cell with said third DNA segment and culturing the transformed host cell to regulate the transcription of said structural gene; or
      <br/>
      (e) microinjecting a fertilized embryo with said third DNA segment and implanting the injected embryo into the oviduct of a foster mother to produce a transgenic animal in which the transcription of said structural gene is regulated.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In important and further embodiments, a method is provided for determining the ability of a candidate substance to modulate the transcription of keratinocyte specific genes, which method comprises (a) providing a nucleic acid sequence containing the distal and proximal regulatory elements, a promoter and a reporter gene under the transcriptional control of both of the regulatory elements and the promoter which is capable of conferring a detectable signal on a host cell, (b) transfecting said nucleic acid sequence into a host cell to produce a cell culture or transgenic animal, (c) contacting the cell culture or transgenic animal with the candidate substance, and (d) detecting the signal produced by said cell culture or transgenic animal.
      <br/>
      The greater the signal the greater the activating character of the candidate, or, alternatively, the less the signal, the less the activating character of the candidate.
      <br/>
      Transcriptionally modulating candidate substances are then evaluated further for potential as, for example, pharmaceutical agents using conventional techniques and animal models.

      FIG. 1B. Expression of pK14P Constructs in Transiently Transfected SCC-13 Keratinocytes.
      <br/>
      SCC-13 cells were transiently transfected with pK14P constructs illustrated in FIG. 1A. At 90 hrs post transfection, cells were lysed and separated into soluble and insoluble fractions. The soluble fraction was removed for  BETA -galactosidase assays to adjust samples for variation in transfection efficiencies, which varied from 0.1-2.0%. The IF proteins were isolated from the insoluble fraction and samples from equal numbers of transfected cells were resolved by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE) and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described in the methods section of Example I. Lanes represent IF extracts from cells transfected with: lane 1, untransfected; lane 2, pgK14P(-6000); lane 3, pgK14P(-2300); lane 4, pK14PI(-2300); lane 5, pK14PV(-2300); lane 6, pK14P(-2300); lane 7, pK14P(-1000); lane 8, pK14P(-450); lane 9, pgK14P(-450); lane 10, pK14P(-245); lane 11, pgK14P(-245); lane 12, pK14P(-202); lane 13, pgK14P(-202); lane 14, pK14P(-94); lane 15, pgK14P(-94); lane 16, pK14P(+1); lane 17, pgK14P(+1); lane 18, pK14P(-2300 DELTA Stu); lane 19, pgK14P(-2300 DELTA Stu); lane 20,  BETA -galactosidase control plasmid alone. The band detected with anti-P corresponded to the expected mobility of the K14P transgene protein and is indicated at left. Note: Untransfected control cells and cells transfected with 5' deletion constructs containing fewer than 2100 bp upstream sequence showed no K14P protein, even when immunoblots were overexposed for 4 days. Note also that a construct missing the 670 bp internal StuI fragment within the 2300 bp 5' upstream sequence retained its ability to express K14P.

      FIG. 2A, FIG. 2B, FIG. 2C, FIG. 2D and FIG. 2E. Tissue-specific Expression of K14P in Transgenic Mice.
      <br/>
      Mouse embryos were microinjected with K14P genes purified from either: pK14P(-2300), containing the entire K14 5' upstream sequence; pK14P(-450), containing the proximal element only; or pK14P(-2300 DELTA Stu), missing 670 bp of 5' upstream sequence, but still containing the K14 proximal and distal elements (see Methods). Transgenic mice were derived and assayed by Southern Blot analyses to determine relative transgene copy number, as described by Vassar et al.(1989). Six different founder mice were obtained for the K14P(-2300) construct, seven for the K14P(-450) construct, and one for the K14P(-2300 DELTA Stu) construct. For all founder mice of a single construct, patterns of transgene expression were similar. Expression in founder mice was examined by immunohistochemistry of Bouin's fixed sections (5  MU m) of tail skin. Tails were from: FIG. 2A, transgenic with .about.1-2 copies of K14P(-2300); FIG. 2B, negative control mouse; FIG. 2C, transgenic with .about.10 copies of K14P(-450); FIG. 2D, transgenic with .about.1-2 copies of K14P(-2300 DELTA Stu) showing basal-preferred staining; FIG. 2E, same transgenic in FIG. 2D, but showing some aberrant staining in suprabasal cells. Bar represents 16  MU m. Note: none of the K14P(-450) founders showed any evidence of K14P expression.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="36">The present invention embodies the realization that the genetic elements which are responsible for promoting keratinocyte expression can be isolated away from homologous keratinocyte genes and employed to confer keratinocyte expression to associated, typically heterologous, genes.</p>
    <p num="37">
      It is proposed that keratinocyte specific expression is conferred, in part, by a DNA sequence 10 nucleotides in length.
      <br/>
      Due to its relatively short length, such sequences may be routinely synthesized using DNA synthesizers, thus obviating a need for isolation of the sequences from natural sources.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The inventor has discovered and characterized discreet sequence regions which exist upstream of keratinocyte expressed structural genes.
      <br/>
      It was found that two regions, termed the proximal and distal elements, are needed to confer keratinocyte regulatory capability.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, the minimal sequence requirement, or "core" region, of the proximal element has been localized to the 10 base sequence region G-C-C-T-G-C-A-G-G-C (SEQ ID NO:1).
      <br/>
      The distal element comprises 300-400 nucleotides which are located 1700 to 2100 nucleotides upstream from the human K14 gene transcriptional start site, i.e. between positions -1700 and -2100.
      <br/>
      These two elements act co-operatively like an enhancer element and likely serve as binding sites for transcriptional elements.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      To obtain a DNA segment containing distal element sequences, one would prepare a DNA segment corresponding to the region located 1700 to 2100 nucleotides upstream from the transcriptional start site of the human K14 gene, i.e. the nucleotides between -1700 and -2100.
      <br/>
      A convenient method for obtaining such a sequence is to utilize restriction enzyme(s) to excise an appropriate piece of DNA.
      <br/>
      Restriction enzyme technology is commonly used in the art and will be generally known to the skilled artisan.
      <br/>
      One would chose any one, or two, of an extensive range of restriction enzymes following an analysis of the sequences broadly around -1700 and -2100 of the K14 gene.
      <br/>
      The portion of DNA containing the distal site could then be excised using the chosen enzymes.
      <br/>
      If desired, for example, for subsequent ligation strategies, one could even create a particular restriction site by genetic engineering.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The present invention contemplates that the distal element together with the proximal 10 nucleotide core region can be employed in connection with any selected heterologous or even homologous structural gene.
      <br/>
      This basic regulatory unit (i.e. the distal element and the 10 nucleotide palindrome) has been characterized from an analysis of upstream control regions of keratinocyte-expressed structural genes.
      <br/>
      Thus, it will typically be preferred to employ longer sequence stretches that comprise the identified regions.
      <br/>
      This is because although the core region is all that is ultimately required, it is believed that particular advantages accrue, in terms of regulation and level of induction achieved where one employs sequences which correspond to the natural control regions over longer regions, e.g., up to around 25 or so nucleotides and preferably no longer than 1000 to 1500 or nucleotides in length.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The novel control sequences of the present invention may be even more advantageously employed in the form of multiple units, in numerous various combinations and organizations, in forward or reverse orientations, and the like.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in the context of multiple unit embodiments and/or in embodiments which incorporate both positive and negative control units, there is not necessarily a requirement that such units be arranged in an adjacent head-to-head or head-to-tail construction in that the improved regulation capability of such multiple units is conferred virtually independent of the location of such multiple sequences with respect to each other.
      <br/>
      Moreover, there is not necessarily a requirement that each unit comprise the same positive or negative element.
      <br/>
      All that may be required is that such sequences be located upstream of and sufficiently proximal to a transcription initiation site.
      <br/>
      However, in a preferred aspect of the improved multiple unit embodiment, the control sequences are located within 200 nucleotides of each other.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      When employed in the context of heterologous structural genes, the precise location of the control sequences of the invention with respect to transcription initiation site is not particularly crucial.
      <br/>
      For example, some benefit will generally be obtained when such control sequences are located up to about 300 nucleotides or more from a transcription initiation site.
      <br/>
      However, in more preferred embodiments, control sequences are located within 200 nucleotides of such a site.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Therefore, to employ the foregoing regulatory elements in the context of heterologous genes, one simply obtains the structural gene and locates one or more of such control units (proximal and distal elements) upstream of a transcription initiation site.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a TATA-box sequence is needed upstream of and proximal to a transcription initiation site of the heterologous structural gene.
      <br/>
      Such sequences may be synthesized and inserted in the same manner as the novel control elements.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, one may desire to simply employ the TATA sequences normally associated with the heterologous gene.
      <br/>
      In any event, TATA sequences are most desirably located between about 20 and 30 nucleotides upstream of transcription initiation.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Numerous methods are known in the art for precisely locating selected sequences at selected points within larger sequences.
      <br/>
      Most conveniently, the desired control sequence or sequences, or combinations of sequences, are synthesized and restriction site linker fragments added to the control sequence termini.
      <br/>
      This allows for ready insertion of control sequences into compatible restriction sites within upstream regions.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, synthesized control sequences may be ligated directly to selected regions.
      <br/>
      Moreover, site specific mutagenesis may be employed to fashion restriction sites into which control sequences may be inserted in the case where no convenient restriction sites are found at a desired insertion site.
    </p>
    <p num="45">However, and as noted above, it is believed that the control sequences of the present invention may be beneficially employed in the context of any heterologous structural gene, with or without additional homologous or heterologous control or promotion sequences.</p>
    <p num="46">
      With respect to the novel screening method for identifying compounds which either stimulate or inhibit keratinocyte gene expression, the method as provided herein preferably employs a reporter gene that confers on its recombinant hosts a readily detectable phenotype that is either expressed or inhibited, as may be the case.
      <br/>
      Generally reporter genes encode (a) a polypeptide not otherwise produced by the host cell; or (b) a protein or factor produced by the host cell but at lower levels; or (c) a mutant form of a polypeptide produced by the host cell.
      <br/>
      Preferably the gene encodes an enzyme which produces colorimetric or fluorometric change in the host cell which is detectable by in situ analysis and which is a quantitative or semi-quantitative function of transcriptional activation.
      <br/>
      Exemplary enzymes include esterases, phosphatases, proteases (tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase) and other enzymes capable of being detected by activity which generates a chromophore or fluorophore as will be known to those of skill in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      One such example is E. coli beta-galactosidase.
      <br/>
      This enzyme produces a color change upon cleavage of the indigogenic substrate indolyl-B-D-galactoside by cells bearing beta-galactosidase (Goring et al., 1987; Price et al., 1987, incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      Thus, this enzyme facilitates automatic plate reader analysis of expression directly in microtiter wells containing transformants treated with candidate activators.
      <br/>
      Also, since the endogenous beta-galactosidase activity in mammalian cells ordinarily is quite low, the analytic screening system using B-galactosidase is not hampered by host cell background.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Another class of reporter genes which confer detectable characteristics on a host cell are those which encode polypeptides, generally enzymes, which render their transformants resistant against toxins, e.g., the neo gene which protects host cells against toxic levels of the antibiotic G418; a gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase, which confers resistance to methotrexate, or the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (Osborne et al., 1985).
      <br/>
      Genes of this class are not preferred since the phenotype (resistance) does not provide a convenient or rapid quantitative output.
      <br/>
      Resistance to antibiotic or toxin requires days of culture to confirm, or complex assay procedures if other than a biological determination is to be made.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Other genes for use in the screening assay herein are those capable of transforming hosts to express unique cell surface antigens, e.g., viral env proteins such as HIV gp120 or herpes gD, which are readily detectable by immunoassays.
      <br/>
      However, antigenic reporters are not preferred because, unlike enzymes, they are not catalytic and thus do not amplify their signals.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The polypeptide products of the reporter gene are secreted, intracellular or, as noted above, membrane bound polypeptides.
      <br/>
      If the polypeptide is not ordinarily secreted it is fused to a heterologous signal sequence for processing and secretion.
      <br/>
      In other circumstances the signal is modified in order to remove sequences that interdict secretion.
      <br/>
      For example, the herpes gD coat protein has been modified by site directed deletion of its transmembrane binding domain, thereby facilitating its secretion (EP 139,417A, incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      This truncated form of the herpes gD protein is detectable in the culture medium by conventional immunoassays.
      <br/>
      Preferably, however, the products of the reporter gene are lodged in the intra-cellular or membrane compartments.
      <br/>
      Then they can be fixed to the culture container, e.g. microtiter wells, in which they are grown, followed by addition of a detectable signal generating substance such as chromogenic substrate for reporter enzymes.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In general, a keratinocyte gene regulator is employed to control transcription and hence influence expression of the reporter gene.
      <br/>
      The process which in its entirety leads to enhanced transcriptional promoter is termed "activation".
      <br/>
      The mechanism by which a successful candidate is acting is not material in any case since the objective is to regulate the gene by whatever means will function to do so.
      <br/>
      While use of the entire keratinocyte upstream promoter will most closely model the therapeutic target, the 10 base regulator region and the distal element of the K14 gene (-1700 to -2100) may optionally be multimerized and placed in front of a TATA box in order to increase the sensitivity of the screening assay.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The keratinocyte promoter and enhancer, whether a hybrid or the native promoter, is ligated to DNA encoding the reporter gene by conventional methods.
      <br/>
      The elements are obtained by in vitro synthesis and/or recovered from genomic DNA.
      <br/>
      They are ligated upstream of the start codon of the reporter gene.
      <br/>
      The promoter also will contain an AT-rich region (TATA box) located between the keratinocyte regulatory elements and the reporter gene start codon.
      <br/>
      The region 3' to the coding sequence for the reporter gene will contain a transcription termination and polyadenylation site, for example the human keratin K14 polyA site.
      <br/>
      The promoter and reporter gene are inserted into a replicable vector and transfected into a cloning host such as E. coli, the host cultured and the replicated vector recovered in order to prepare sufficient quantities of the construction for later transfection into a suitable eukaryotic host.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The host cells used in the screening assay herein generally are mammalian cells, and are either primary or permanent cell lines, or fertilized mammalian embryos.
      <br/>
      Examples of cultured cells include cultured primary human keratinocytes and SCC-13 keratinocytes derived from a human squamous carcinoma of the skin.
      <br/>
      Mammalian embryos that may be used include those of the mouse, which would prove useful in transgenic mouse studies.
      <br/>
      The vector is transfected or microinjected into the desired host, and the reporter gene is assayed for chromosomal integration and or incorporation and expression.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The screening assay may also be conducted by growing the transformants to confluency in microtiter wells, adding serial molar proportions of a candidate substance to a series of wells, and determining the signal level after an incubation period that is sufficient to demonstrate its effect on signal expression.
      <br/>
      The wells containing varying proportions of candidate are then evaluated for signal activation.
      <br/>
      Candidates that demonstrate dose related enhancement of reporter gene transcription or expression are then selected for further evaluation as clinical therapeutic agents.
      <br/>
      The stimulation of transcription may be observed, in which case the candidate compound might be a positive stimulator of the element.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the candidate compound might inhibit expression, which would indicate that it functions to oppose the element.
      <br/>
      Candidate compounds of either class might be useful therapeutic agents.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      It should be understood that the screening method herein is useful notwithstanding that effective candidates may not be found, since it would be a practical utility to know that activators or inhibitors do not exist.
      <br/>
      The invention involves providing a method for screening for such candidates, not in finding them.

    <p num="57">1. Construction of Recombinant Clones</p>
    <p num="58">I. pK14P(-2300) and Derivatives</p>
    <p num="59">
      Clone pK14P(-2300) was previously referred to as pH3cK14.P (Vassar et al., 1989).
      <br/>
      In order, it contains .about.2300 bp of sequence 5' to the K14 transcriptional initiation site (Marchuk et al., 1985); the 5' untranslated sequence of the K14 gene; the complete human K14 coding sequence except for sequences encoding the 5 carboxy terminal amino acid residues, which were replaced with sequences encoding the antigenic portion of a neuropeptide substance P (Albers and Fuchs, 1987); a TGA translation stop codon; and K14 genomic sequences including the 3' untranslated sequences, polyadenylation signal, and approximately 700 bp of 3' downstream sequence.
      <br/>
      This insert was cloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of plasmid pGEM2 (Promega Biotech., Madison, Wis.) as described by Vassar et al. (1989).
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      To make 5' deletions of the parent clone pK14P(-2300), convenient restriction endonuclease sites located in the 2300 bp 5' upstream sequence were utilized in conjunction with the unique Eco RI site at the 3' end of the K14 genomic sequences.
      <br/>
      K14P inserts were created by double digestion with EcoRI and either EcoRV, StuI, HaeII, or AvaI (FIG. 1A) and the inserts cloned into multiple cloning regions of appropriate pGEM plasmids.
      <br/>
      This resulted in pK14P(-1000), pK14P(-450), pK14P(-94) and pK14(+1), respectively.
      <br/>
      To create pK14P(-6000), the 6400 bp EcoRI-KpnI fragment was isolated from the 5' end of genomic clone GK-1 (Marchuk et al., 1985), ligated to the 1800 bp KpnI-EcoRI 3' fragment from pK14P(-2300), and inserted into the EcoRI site of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). pK14P(-245) and pK14P(-202) were made by limited Bal 31 exonuclease digestion of pK14P(-450), followed by digestion with EcoRI and ligation of the resulting K14P fragment into pGEM2.
      <br/>
      Finally, pK14P(-2300 DELTA Stu) was created by digesting pK14P(-2300) with StuI and relegating the large fragment.
    </p>
    <p num="61">II. pgK14P(-2300) and Intron-Containing Derivatives</p>
    <p num="62">
      To create pgK14P(-2300) containing introns 1 through 5 from the K14 gene, pK14P(-2300) was partially digested with SphI and completely digested with KpnI.
      <br/>
      The resulting fragment, containing K14 cDNA sequence from exon 1 through exon 6, was replaced by the corresponding KpnI-SphI sequence from genomic subclone pJgK14 (Giudice and Fuchs, 1987).
      <br/>
      The KpnI-EcoRI fragment from pgK14P(-2300) containing coding sequences, introns and 3' flanking region, was used to replace the corresponding KpnI-EcoRI fragment from pK14P(-X) clones to create the respective intron-containing clones: pgK14P(-450), pgK14P(-245), pgK14P(-202), pgK14P(-94), pgK14P(+1), and pgK14P(-2300 DELTA Stu). pgK14PI(-6000) was made by ligating the EcoRI-KpnI 5' K14 fragment from pK14P(-6000) with the KpnI-EcoRI 3' K14 fragment from pK14P(-2300) and inserting them into the EcoRI site of pGEM3Z. pK14PI(-2300) was made by replacing the 138 bp KpnI-SacII fragment from pK14P(-2300) with the 1400 bp KpnI-SacII fragment from pgK14PI(-2300) which contains intron I. pK14PV(-2300) was created by replacing the 967 bp BglII fragment from pK14P(-2300) with the 1062 bp fragment from pgK14P(-2300) which contains intron V.

      To facilitate future cloning steps, the 55 bp HindIII-EcoRI fragment from pGEM3 containing the multiple cloning region was ligated into the HindIII site of pSV0CAT (Gorman et al., 1982) to create pSV0CAT-PL1.
      <br/>
      Incompatible 5' or 3' extended ends created by restriction enzyme digestion of all DNAs were blunted using E. coli polymerase Klenow fragment (5' ends) or T4 DNA polymerase (3' ends). pK14CAT(-2100) was created by inserting the 2100 bp AvaI fragment from pK14P(-2300) into the AvaI site of pSV0CAT-PL1. pK14CAT(-2300) was made by replacing the 1800 bp XbaI-Bsu36I fragment from pk14CAT(-2100) with the 2000 bp HindIII-Bsu36I fragment from pK14P(-2300).

    <p num="65">
      To create pK14CAT(-6000), the 1300 bp XbaI-EcoRV fragment from pK14CAT(-2100) was replaced with the 4700 bp EcoRI-EcoRV fragment from pK14P(-6000).

      The 1000 bp EcoRV-AvaI fragment from pK14P(-2300) was ligated into the XbaI-AvaI sites of pSV0CAT.PL1 to form pK14CAT(-1000). pK14CAT(-450), pK14CAT(-270) and pK14CAT(-94) were made by digesting pK14CAT(-2100) with StuI and XbaI, Bsu36I and XbaI or NheI and XbaI respectively, and then relegating.
      <br/>
      Finally, to create pK14CAT(-2000), pK14CAT(-1700) and pK14CAT(-1400), pK14P(-2300) was digested with Bal 31 exonuclease followed by digestion with AvaI.
      <br/>
      The Bal 31-AvaI fragments were then ligated into the XbaI-AvaI sites of pSV0CAT.PL1.

      The parental construct for proximal deletion plasmids was pK14CAT(-2100).

    <p num="89">1. Sequences Sufficient for Keratinocyte-Specific Expression of the Human K14 Gene Reside in the 5' Upstream Region</p>
    <p num="90">
      In the human genome, there are three K14 genes, but only one appears to be functional (Marchuk et al., 1985; Rosenberg et al., 1988).
      <br/>
      To identify sequences involved in controlling K14 gene expression in keratinocytes, the inventors first investigated whether there might be any important sequences 3' from the transcriptional initiation site.
      <br/>
      Since keratinocytes transfect with relatively poor efficiency (&lt;1%), an immunological assay was employed to measure the amount of a modified K14 protein produced as a consequence of gene transfection.
      <br/>
      To distinguish the transgene product from endogenous K14, sequences encoding the C-terminal antigenic portion of substance P were added (Albers and Fuchs, 1987).
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      A hybrid K14 gene-modified cDNA was then prepared as described in the foregoing Methods section and as outlined in the description for FIG. 1A. Approximately 6000 bp of 5' K14 gene sequence was used to drive expression of the K14P gene, which contained the first five introns out of seven present in the endogenous K14 gene (Marchuk et al., 1985).
      <br/>
      The construct, referred to as pgK14P(-6000), also contained most of the 3' noncoding sequence of the K14 mRNA and an additional 700 bp of K14 3' downstream sequence.
      <br/>
      Additional constructs were made which contained 2300 bp of 5' upstream K14 gene sequence coupled to K14P genes with either introns I-V, intron I, intron V or no introns as illustrated in FIG. 1A (see foregoing Methods section for derivation of the constructs).
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      To examine expression of these constructs in keratinocytes, we transfected them into SCC-13 cells derived from a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and known to retain K5 and K14 expression (Wu and Rheinwald, 1981).
      <br/>
      The transgene product was detected by immunoblot analysis of SDS-PAGE-resolved keratins using an anti-P antibody.
      <br/>
      The first six lanes of FIG. 1B illustrate the results of transfection analyses of our intron constructs.
      <br/>
      While the anti-P antibody showed no crossreactivity with any proteins from untransfected keratinocytes (lane 1), cells transfected with any of the five K14P constructs produced an IF protein with mobility slightly greater than 50 kd, as expected for the K14P protein (lanes 2-6).
      <br/>
      Cells transfected with pgK14P(-6000) produced somewhat lower levels of K14P than cells transfected with any of the constructs containing only 2300 bp of 5' upstream sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      While later studies rendered the significance of this observation doubtful, its occurrence prompted the inventors to use the -2300 5' fragment for the intron constructs.
      <br/>
      Despite occasional variability among repeated assays, cells transfected with any of these intron-containing constructs produced amounts of K14P similar to that made by cells transfected with an intronless construct.
      <br/>
      Collectively, the data indicated that sequences within the first five introns did not appear to contribute appreciably to K14 gene expression.
      <br/>
      Additional evidence to support this conclusion is provided below.

    <p num="94">2. Role of 5' Upstream Sequences in Human K14 Gene Expression: Preliminary Evidence for the Existence of a Distal Element</p>
    <p num="95">
      To examine the role of 5' upstream sequences, either the K14P intronless reporter gene or the K14P reporter gene with five introns was used.
      <br/>
      These sequences were linked to varying portions of the K14 5' upstream sequences, as shown in FIG. 1A. These constructs were then transfected into SCC-13 keratinocytes and assayed immunologically for K14P protein (FIG. 1B).
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, none of the constructs containing 1000 bp or less of 5' upstream sequence showed detectable K14P protein as judged by immunoblot analysis (lanes 7-17).
      <br/>
      This was true whether introns were present (odd numbered lanes) or not (even numbered lanes), and even when the immunoblots were over-exposed, K14P expression was not detected.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      To see whether K14P was made in any of the cells transfected with the pK14P( &lt;= -1000) constructs, transiently transfected cultures were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis using an anti-P antibody.
      <br/>
      In fact, a few positive cells could be detected from transfections of all constructs except pK14P(+1), missing the TATA box (data not shown).
      <br/>
      However, the number of cells showing detectable expression of K14P was .about.100 *  less than that seen for cells transfected with the -2300 constructs.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      Interestingly, when sequences 450 bp 5' from the transcription initiation site were coupled with sequences spanning from 1120-2300 bp 5', gene expression was partially restored (lanes 18-19).
      <br/>
      Thus, immunoblot analysis of IF preparations from cells transfected with pK14P(-2300 DELTA Stu) or pgK14P(-2300 DELTA Stu) showed detectable levels of K14P, which on average were only .about.2-5 *  less than cells transfected with pK14(-2300) �see lanes 18-19, pK14P(-2300 DELTA Stu) and pgK14(-2300 DELTA Stu), respectively�. This observation suggested that within 1180 bp 5' upstream from the transcription initiation site, there is a distal regulatory element(s) necessary for K14 gene expression.

    <p num="98">3. Existence of a Distal Regulatory Element in the Human K14 Gene Is Confirmed by Transgenic Mice Studies</p>
    <p num="99">
      To verify that the distal element in the human K14 gene was a bona fide requirement for K14 gene expression, the purified genes from pK14P(-2300), pK14P(-450) and pK14P(-2300 DELTA Stu) were introduced into the germline of mouse embryos.
      <br/>
      Previously, the inventors described analyses of six transgenic mice harboring the insert K14P(-2300) (Vassar et al., 1989).
      <br/>
      As judged by indirect anti-P immunogold staining of tissue sections from transgenic offspring, every mouse that we tested which was transgenic for the K14P(-2300) construct expressed K14P in stratified squamous epithelial tissues, but not in other tissues (Vassar et al., 1989).

    <p num="100">
      FIG. 2A, FIG. 2B, FIG. 2C, FIG. 2D and FIG. 2E illustrate immunohistochemical anti-P staining of a section (5  MU m) of tail skin from a mouse transgenic with .about.1-2 copies of the K14P(-2300) construct FIG. 2A. As compared to a control (nontransgenic) mouse tail section FIG. 2B, the transgenic mouse tail showed primarily basal layer staining.
      <br/>
      In contrast to the easily detectable expression of K14P protein in K14P(-2300) transgenic mice, none of the seven different founder mice harboring 1-10 copies of the K14P(-450) gene showed detectable levels of K14P expression (see FIG. 2C, mouse tail skin from a mouse with 10 copies of the gene).
      <br/>
      Even though endogenous mouse K14 was readily detectable in these mice, transgene protein was not detected, as judged by both immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis.
      <br/>
      These data are consistent with the in vitro studies showing failure of pK14P(-450) to give detectable levels of expression.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      As further confirmation that K14 gene expression requires a distal element, a transgenic founder mouse with .about.1-2 copies of K14P(-2300 DELTA Stu) genes showed detectable levels of K14P in skin (see FIG. 2D for tail skin).
      <br/>
      However, while basal expression was seen in some portions of the tail skin as shown in FIG. 2D, some suprabasal cells also stained with anti-P (FIG. 2E).
      <br/>
      Despite this somewhat aberrant staining pattern within epidermis, no staining was observed in dermis or in any other non-epidermal cells of the skin.
      <br/>
      Collectively, the transgenic data are in agreement with the in vitro studies, and indicate that there are sequences distal to the TATA box and transcription initiation site of the K14 gene which are necessary for its expression in stratified squamous epithelia.

    <p num="102">4. A More Detailed Analysis of the Distal Element in the Human K14 Gene</p>
    <p num="103">
      To conduct a more extensive and quantitative analyses of the K14 distal element, the sensitivity of the assay was improved by constructing a series of clones in which varying amounts of the 5' upstream sequences of the human K14 gene were used to drive expression of a reporter gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) (Gorman et al., 1983).
      <br/>
      The 5' deletion clones used for transfection are shown in FIG. 3A.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      When SCC-13 cells were co-transfected with a control  BETA -galactosidase plasmid into SCC-13 keratinocytes, and with pK14CAT constructs containing 2000-6000 bp of 5' upstream K14 gene sequence, all transfected cell extracts contained appreciable levels of CAT as measured by the immuno-sandwich ELISA assay (FIG. 3A).
      <br/>
      When  BETA -galactosidase assays were conducted to correct for variations in transfection efficiencies, it was apparent that within a factor of three, the levels of CAT were similar for cells transfected with either pK14CAT(-6000), pK14CAT(-2300), pK14CAT(-2100) or pK14CAT(-2000) (see relative CAT levels given in FIG. 3A).
      <br/>
      These data were in agreement with and extended the previous results obtained with K14P constructs.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      As expected from the previous K14P studies, we detected only background levels of CAT when SCC-13 cells were transfected with pK14CAT(-1000) or with constructs containing more severe deletions.
      <br/>
      Moreover, even with cells transfected with a new construct containing 1400 bp of 5' upstream K14 gene sequence, CAT was not above background levels.
      <br/>
      With another new construct, pK14CAT(-1700), CAT was detected, but at levels which were only .about.10% those of cells transfected with a construct containing 300 additional bp of 5' upstream sequence.
      <br/>
      Collectively, the data indicate that within .about.300-400 bp in a region spanning -1700 to -2100 5' upstream from the human K14 gene, there is a sequence which enhances CAT expression in keratinocytes.
    </p>
    <p num="106">5. The Distal Element Contributes to Tissue-specific Expression of the K14 Gene.</p>
    <p num="107">
      To assess whether AP2 is required for tissue-specific expression, the possibility that the K14 distal element (positions -2300 to -1700) might be able to function with a heterologous AP2-less promoter in keratinocytes was tested.
      <br/>
      The thymidine kinase (TK) promoter-CAT plasmid pBLCAT2 was chosen for analysis, since this promoter is well-characterized, consisting of binding sites for transcription factor TFIID, Sp1, and "CCAAT box" factors (Luckow &amp; Schutz, 1987).
      <br/>
      The K14 distal element was inserted 5' upstream from the TX promoter to produce the plasmid pBLDISTCAT.
      <br/>
      When transfected into SCC13 keratinocytes, pBLDISTCAT elicited CAT expression at a significantly higher level than was obtained with pBLCAT2.
      <br/>
      Interestingly, pBLDISTCAT-transfected HepG2 cells showed reduced CAT expression over that obtained with pBLCAT2.
      <br/>
      Thus, as judged from these data, the distal element not only contributed to keratinocyte-specific enhancement of an AP2-less promoter but also seemed to play a role in promoter repression in a nonkeratinocyte (HepG2) cell line.
      <br/>
      These studies provide the most direct evidence to date that the K14 distal element not only is required for appreciable levels of gene expression but also is involved in tissue specificity.

    <p num="108">6. Evidence for a Major Proximal Element Which Acts Cooperatively with the Distal Element to Control Expression of the Human K14 Gene</p>
    <p num="109">
      To determine whether any additional sequences are required in conjunction with the distal regulatory element, a series of 5' internal deletions progressing toward the TATA box and transcription initiation site of the K14 gene were constructed.
      <br/>
      To achieve a measurable CAT signal, sequences -2100 to either -1120 or -1000 were present in all constructs.
      <br/>
      The clones used for the initial CAT assays are shown in FIG. 3B, along with the relative CAT levels obtained after SCC-13 keratinocytes were cotransfected with each construct and a  BETA -galactosidase control plasmid.
      <br/>
      For this set of experiments, linear range CAT levels obtained with extracts from cells transfected with pK14CAT (-2100) were taken as 100%.
      <br/>
      In agreement with the immunological results obtained with the pK14P(-2300 DELTA Stu) construct, appreciable CAT levels (40% +- 15%) were obtained from extracts of cells transfected with pK14CAT( DELTA -1120/-450).
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      However, since deletion of sequences between the two StuI sites consistently led to somewhat reduced reporter gene expression (either K14P or CAT), there may be a weak positive element(s) located between -450 and -1120 bp.
      <br/>
      When cells were transfected with pK14CAT( DELTA -1120/-270) containing a larger internal deletion, the relative CAT levels obtained were often greater than obtained with the parent construct.
      <br/>
      Hence, there might be a weak negative regulatory element between -450 and -270 bp.
      <br/>
      Whenever both sequences were deleted, e.g., in pK14CAT( DELTA -1120/-270), transfection yielded SCC-13 extracts with close to wild type K14CAT expression.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      Interestingly, removal of an additional 110 bp of K14 gene sequence, to create pK14CAT( DELTA -1120/-160), produced a plasmid which when transfected into SCC-13 keratinocytes, generated almost no CAT activity above background levels (FIG. 3B).
      <br/>
      Further deletion to make pK14CAT( DELTA -1120/-94) gave background levels of CAT.
      <br/>
      These data demonstrated the existence of a major proximal regulatory domain contributing to human K14 gene expression.
      <br/>
      Without the proximal domain located at -160 to -270, sequences encompassing the distal domain and the TATA box were not sufficient to drive expression of CAT in SCC-13 keratinocytes.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since constructs containing the proximal domain in the absence of the distal domain are also not able to drive CAT expression in SCC-13 cells (FIG. 3A), these data suggest strongly that the proximal and distal domains act cooperatively to regulate K14 gene expression.
      <br/>
      A summary of these data is given in FIG. 4.
    </p>
    <p num="112">7. A Protein in SCC-13 Nuclear Extracts Binds to the Proximal Domain</p>
    <p num="113">
      The proximal element was then further characterized.
      <br/>
      The sequence from -270 to the transcription initiation site was first completed (FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      At -175 to -183 was located a sequence 5' A A G C C C A A A 3' which was similar to a consensus 5' A A N C C A A A 3' (often referred to as the CK-8 mer) previously recognized by Blessing et al. (1987) to be present in the 5' upstream region of a number of genes expressed primarily in keratinocytes.
      <br/>
      At -230 to -253 was located the sequence 5' T G G G A A A G 3', which was similar to the SV40 core enhancer consensus 5' G T G G A A A G 3' (see Marchuk et al., 1985).
      <br/>
      However, the most striking aspect about the sequence within the proximal domain was that the sequence did not share 100% identity with any known regulatory consensus element thus far identified (Wingender, 1988).
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      To assess whether any of these sequences might be an important part of the proximal element and to determine whether the proximal and distal elements share a common regulatory sequence, the ability of the 110 bp proximal sequence to bind proteins isolated from human keratinocyte (SCC-13) nuclear extracts was examined.
      <br/>
      The DNA probe was a 176 bp Bsu36 I/NheI fragment, spanning the sequence -270 to -94 bp 5' upstream from the K14 transcription initiation site (FIG. 6A, probe).
      <br/>
      When radiolabeled double stranded probe was combined with nuclear extract isolated from SCC-13 keratinocytes, a complex was produced which was resolved by non-denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis and which showed significantly slower mobility than the probe itself (FIG. 6B, compare first lane, probe alone, with second lane, probe and nuclear extract).
      <br/>
      Protein-DNA complex formation was not influenced by the presence of non-specific competitor DNA, poly dI.dC (FIG. 6B, all lanes), but was greatly reduced by adding a 100-fold molar excess of specific competitor DNA identical to the radiolabeled probe (FIG. 6B, last lane; FIG. 6C, competitor no. 4).
      <br/>
      These data suggested that a nuclear factor present in SCC-13 nuclear extracts specifically bound the K14 promoter, within the region of -270 and -94 bp 5' upstream from the transcription initiation site.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      When the entire sequence from +1 to -2100 5' upstream of the human K14 gene was divided into 5 DNA fragments (see FIG. 6A for details) and used in 100-fold molar excess as competitors, only the unlabeled fragment containing the -270 to -94 bp sequence competed effectively for binding of probe to the major nuclear factor (FIG. 6C, compare lane with competitor no. 4, i.e. unlabeled probe DNA, with lanes containing competitors no. 1, 2, 3, or 5).
      <br/>
      These data indicate that the nuclear factor bound specifically to the DNA fragment encompassing the proximal domain, but did not bind effectively to DNA fragments encompassing other 5' upstream K14 sequences, including the DNA fragment encompassing the distal domain.
      <br/>
      Collectively, the results suggest that if the distal domain binds the same factor as the proximal domain, it probably does so with a weaker association constant.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      The major band seen in the gel retardation assays was the only one which was dramatically reduced as a consequence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe.
      <br/>
      The protein(s) involved in the formation of this complex were termed KER1 (AP2).
      <br/>
      Several minor bands were also detected in the gel shift assays (FIGS. 6B and 6C).
      <br/>
      One band which migrated at slightly slower mobility persisted when the assay was conducted in the presence of unlabeled competitor probe (lanes with competitor no. 4), indicating that this band likely originated from non-specific protein-DNA interactions.
      <br/>
      Several bands which migrated at slightly faster mobility than the major band were not seen with fresh preparations of nuclear extract and probably represented degradation products of the KER1 (AP2) protein.
    </p>
    <p num="117">8. Localization of the Binding Site for the Keratinocyte Nuclear Factor KER1 (AP2)</p>
    <p num="118">
      To further localize the DNA sequence involved in KER1 (AP2) binding, the mobility shift assays were repeated, this time using annealed (i.e. double stranded) synthetic oligomers as unlabeled competitors.
      <br/>
      The six sets of complementary oligomers spanned the length of the 176 bp Bsu36I/NheI probe, and each set overlapped the next in sequence by 15 nucleotides (See FIG. 7A).
      <br/>
      Only the set of oligomers spanning region II (-195 to -240) quantitatively competed for binding of KER1 (AP2) to the 176 bp radiolabeled probe (FIG. 7B, competitor II).
      <br/>
      The set of oligomers spanning region III (-165 to -210) exhibited some competition for binding, but not consistently.
      <br/>
      Collectively, the data indicate that the keratinocyte nuclear factor KER1 (AP2) binds to a sequence located within region II.
      <br/>
      The sequences in oligomer set II were entirely within the sequence extending from -160 to -270, i.e., the sequences shown by CAT assays to constitute the proximal domain necessary for expression of the human K14 gene.

    <p num="119">9. KER1 (AP2) Binds to a Specific Sequence in Both the K14 and the K1 Genes and Is Involved in K14 Gene Expression</p>
    <p num="120">
      Methylation interference analysis (Ausubel et al., 1989) was used to localize G nucleotides on either strand of the 176 bp Bsu 36I/NheI fragment (-270 to -94) that closely interact with KER1 (AP2).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8A for the coding strand, methylation of G residues at positions -231, -224 and -223 (denoted by solid arrowheads) resulted in interference with KER1 (AP2) binding, while methylation of a G residue at position -227 (open arrowhead) showed weaker interference.
      <br/>
      Similarly, for the noncoding strand, methylation of G residues at positions -230 and -229 interfered with KER1 (AP2) binding, whereas a methylated G residue at position -226 showed weaker interference (FIG. 8B).
      <br/>
      These data suggested that residues -231 to -222 (encased by a stippled box in FIG. 5) may be involved in KER1 (AP2) binding.
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      To test the validity of the sequences identified in the methylation interference assays, and to further characterize the KER1 (AP2) binding site, a 47 bp double stranded oligomer with a scrambled 9 bp sequence extending from -231 to -223 in the K14 gene was prepared.
      <br/>
      This mutant oligomer (competitor no. 2) failed to compete for binding of KER1 (AP2) to the radiolabeled Bsu 36I/NheI fragment (FIG. 9B, lane 2).
      <br/>
      Three additional double stranded oligomers, with single point mutations in nucleotides -231, -230 and -229, respectively, were also unable to compete for KER1 (AP2) binding (lanes 3-5).
      <br/>
      Conversely, a double stranded oligomer with four bp mutated outside the putative binding sequence effectively competed for KER1 (AP2) binding (lane 6).
      <br/>
      These results confirmed and extended the methylation interference data and indicate that the KER1 (AP2) binding site is the sequence 5' G C C T G C A G G C 3' (SEQ ID NO:1).
      <br/>
      Interestingly, this sequence is a perfect palindrome.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      The KER1 (AP2) binding site was adjacent to a 7 bp sequence 5' C A C A C C T 3' (shown encased in a stippled box in FIG. 5) with 100% sequence identity to a sequence found in the E6/E7 promoter element of HPV 11 (Chin et al., 1989).
      <br/>
      Since a simple epithelial factor, CEII, was shown to bind in the vicinity of this HPV sequence (Chin et al., 1989), it was important to ensure that KER1 (AP2) and its binding site was distinct from CEII and its site.
      <br/>
      Using gel mobility shift assays, it was demonstrated that mutation of this 7-mer sequence in the K14 gene did not interfere with the ability of a double stranded 45-mer (competitor no. 6) to compete for binding to KER1 (FIG. 9B, lane 6).
      <br/>
      Similarly, the corresponding HPV 11 sequence (competitor no. 7) did not block binding of KER1 to the wild-type K14 sequence (lane 7).
      <br/>
      These data confirm that the KER1 (AP2) factor is distinct from the CEII factor.
      <br/>
      As a final control, the sequence similar to the CK 8-mer, the element found in the 5' upstream region of a number of keratinocyte-specific genes, was shown not compete for KER1 (AP2) binding (FIG. 9B, lane 8).

    <p num="123">
      The sequence 5' G C C T G C A G G C 3' (SEQ ID NO:1) was found only once within the 270 bp proximal domain of the K14 gene.
      <br/>
      However, the sequence 5' G C C N N N N G G N 3' (SEQ ID NO:13) corresponding to the G nucleotides identified by methylation interference assays, was found three times within this domain.
      <br/>
      To determine whether this sequence was sufficient to compete for KER1 (AP2) binding, the ability of a 45 bp synthetic oligomer, centered about the sequence 5' G C C T G T G G G 3' (-91 to -83), to compete with the intact proximal region segment was analyzed.
      <br/>
      Competition was not detected at &gt;100 fold excess.
      <br/>
      Hence, residues in addition to those identified by methylation interference must be essential for KER1 (AP2) binding.

    <p num="124">
      On searching the 5' upstream sequences of several human keratinocyte genes, some interesting comparisons were found.
      <br/>
      While 6 bp stretches with 100% identity were found 5' from the involucrin gene (Eckert and Green, 1986) and the K6b gene (Tyner et al., 1985), a sequence identical in 9/10 bp to the KER1 (AP2) binding site, i.e. 5'G G C T G C A G G C 3', (SEQ ID NO:14) was found just 5' from the TATA box in the gene encoding K1, a differentiation-specific gene (Johnson et al., 1985).
      <br/>
      Interestingly, an oligomer corresponding to the wild-type K1 sequence showed competition for KER1 binding (FIG. 9B, lane 9).
      <br/>
      This result demonstrated that KER1 (AP2) binds to at least one other mammalian epidermal keratin gene, and suggested the intriguing possibility that the factor may be important in regulating other keratinocyte genes, some of which are expressed in differentiating keratinocytes.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      To determine whether the KER1 (AP2) binding site played a functional role in CAT expression, a site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on pK14CAT(- DELTA -1120/-270) to engineer a single mutation at residue -230 (C --&gt; A).
      <br/>
      This mutation was chosen because it eliminated competition for KER1 (AP2) binding (see FIG. 9A and FIG. 9B).
      <br/>
      When the point mutant, pK14CAT (mut -230A) was introduced into SCC-13 cells, the level of CAT expression was reduced to 44% of the wild-type levels, thus demonstrating functionality.

    <p num="127">
      To determine whether active KER1 (AP2) is generated by non-keratinocyte cell types, nuclear extracts from a variety of human cell types were isolated: SCC-13, a squamous cell carcinoma cell line of epidermal origin (K14++), diploid WI-38 fibroblasts (K14--), HeLa, a cervical adenocarcinoma cell line (K14--), MCF-7, a mammary adenocarcinoma cell line (K14--), and Jurkat, a T cell lymphoma cell line (K14--).
      <br/>
      Relative KER1 (AP2) binding activity was then measured by combining equal amounts of nuclear protein from each cell type with radiolabeled proximal element as probe and repeating the gel shift mobility assays as before.
      <br/>
      The results of these experiments are shown in FIG. 10.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      As judged by this assay, keratinocytes appeared to produce significantly higher levels of KER1 (lane 1) than any of the non-keratinocyte lines (lanes 2-5).

      While fibroblast (lane 2) and lymphoma extracts (lane 5) showed little or no nuclear binding activity, MCF-7 extracts showed some binding (lane 4), and HeLa extracts showed appreciable binding (lane 3).
      <br/>
      This finding may explain the substantial promiscuous expression of pK14P and pK14CAT constructs in HeLa cells (see also, Vassar et al., 1989).

      It was determined that the last 5 residue of the consensus AP2-binding site were identical to half of the KER1 palindrome.
      <br/>
      A 26 bp oligomer containing an AP2 site was demonstrated to compete for KER1 binding to the proximal element, suggesting that KER1 may be AP2 or an AP2-like factor.
      <br/>
      Since a perfect AP2 site is also upstream from the human K5 gene, AP2 could be generally involved in keratinocyte gene expression.

      The foregoing studies revealed the importance of a sequence, 5' G C C T G C A G G C 3', (SEQ ID NO:1) contained within a 110 bp proximal domain 5' from the transcription initiation site of the human K14 gene.
      <br/>
      That this ten nucleotide motif might be important in regulating keratinocyte-specific gene expression is underscored by the fact that point mutations restrict expression of a reporter CAT gene in transfected keratinocytes and that this sequence is the site for the binding of a nuclear factor, KER1(AP2), which is significantly more abundant in cultured keratinocytes than it is in fibroblasts or in some simple epithelial cell lines.
      <br/>
      The additional finding that a 45 residue sequence in the human K1 gene competes for KER1 binding suggested that KER1 (AP2) may be involved in the keratinocyte-specific expression of more than one gene.

      Interestingly, Snape et al. (1990) reported the characterization of the binding of a Xenopus embryo nuclear factor (KTF-1) to a Xenopus keratin gene expressed specifically at mid-blastula transition in the outer ectoderm.
      <br/>
      Gel shift and methylation interference assays identified the KTF-1 binding sequence as 5' A C C C T G A G G C T 3', (SEQ ID NO:15) and multiple copies of this sequence linked to a reporter gene resulted in enhancement, albeit non-tissue-specific, of gene expression.
      <br/>
      With a one nucleotide gap, this Xenopus sequence shared a 10/11 nucleotide sequence identity with the KER1 (AP2) binding site, prompting the present inventors to examine whether the Xenopus and human nuclear factors might be evolutionarily related.
      <br/>
      Despite the striking sequence similarities between the Xenopus and human sites, the inventors were unable to demonstrate effective competition by a 30 bp oligomer containing the Xenopus sequence (corresponding to "C" in Snape et al., 1990) for binding of KER1 (AP2) to the human K14 proximal element.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      Nevertheless, although competition of the Xenopus sequence was not effective against the human sequence, the remarkable similarities in the binding sites and methylation interference patterns of the two nuclear factors are compelling, and suggest the intriguing possibility that the transcription factor KER1 (AP2) may have evolved from KTF-1.
      <br/>
      That both of these factors appear to be related to, if not identical to, the transcription factor AP2 has been independently demonstrated in the inventor's laboratory (Leask et al., 1991) and by Snape et al., (1991).
      <br/>
      This is of interest as it has recently been shown that AP2 MRNA is primarily expressed in cells of epidermal and neural lineage (Mitchell et al., 1991) consistent with the differential expression studies by the present inventor (Leask et al., 1990).

      The Distal Region: Synergistic Effects Between Two Regulatory Regions Within the Human K14 Keratin Gene.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      The sequences constituting the distal element have not yet been elucidated, nor have the nuclear factors which might interact with these sequences.
      <br/>
      However, in preliminary competition experiments, the inventors were unable to demonstrate competition of a fragment containing the distal element for the binding of KER1 (AP2) to the radiolabeled proximal element.
      <br/>
      While unequivocal demonstration must await elucidation of the precise regulatory sequences of the distal element and the protein(s) that binds to this element, this simplistic data is already suggestive that the two elements may be distinct.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      The interdependency upon the distal and proximal regions of the human K14 gene was particularly strong: neither region alone was sufficient to drive expression of a reporter gene coupled to a TATA box and .about.75 additional 5' upstream K14 gene sequence, whereas the two regions combined gave marked expression.
      <br/>
      The most likely interpretation of these data is that the proximal and distal elements and their respective binding proteins act combinatorially with the TATA box and TFIID to create a stable transcription complex.
      <br/>
      Such synergism has also been reported recently for several promoters, including Drosophila homeobox elements (see for example Han et al., 1989) and the  ALPHA -skeletal actin regulatory elements (Muscat and Kedes, 1987; Gustafson et al., 1988).
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      It is interesting to note that the Xenopus keratin gene element, binding KTF-1/AP2 and sharing homologies with the KER1 (AP2) element, was unable to act in single copy to upregulate expression of a reporter gene (Snape et al., 1990).
      <br/>
      Moreover, in multiple copies, the KTF-1 element was unable to confer epidermis-specific gene expression, suggesting that other factors in addition to KTF-1/AP2 might also be involved in producing high levels of epidermis-specific expression (Snape et al., 1990).
      <br/>
      As the relation between keratin gene expression in Xenopus embryonic ectoderm and adult human epidermis is more deeply explored, and as other keratinocyte genes are analyzed, the extent to which complex and cooperative regulatory elements are generally utilized in keratinocyte-specific gene expression should become clearer.

    <p num="139">Regulation of the Human K14 Gene: Possible Mechanisms for Differentiation-Specific Keratinocyte Expression?</p>
    <p num="140">
      Little is known about the mechanisms controlling the differentiation-specific changes in gene expression patterns in keratinocytes.
      <br/>
      However, the present finding that a sequence which binds KER1 (AP2) is also found 5' upstream from a human K1 gene is suggestive that at least some regulatory elements found in basal keratinocyte genes might be shared among differentiation-specific keratinocyte genes.
      <br/>
      Whether changes in gene expression during keratinocyte differentiation are predominantly controlled by transcription factors which might be differentially modified during the keratinization process, or whether transcriptional changes take place via differential expression of new regulatory factors remains to be determined.
      <br/>
      As more is learned about the distal element involved in K14 gene expression and the role of proximal element factor KER1 (AP2) in the expression of K14 and other keratinocyte-specific genes, some of the remaining mechanisms underlying the changes in gene expression during terminal differentiation may be resolved.
