      Aqueous ink jet ink compositions comprising an aqueous vehicle, a colorant, and an alkoxysilane binder additive, have excellent water and smear fastness and print quality.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to aqueous inks for ink jet printers, and, more particularly, to aqueous inks containing an alkoxysilane binder additive.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Ink jet printing is a non-impact printing process in which droplets of ink are deposited on a substrate such as paper or transparency film in response to an electronic signal.
      <br/>
      Low cost and high quality of the output, combined with relatively noise free operation, have made ink jet printers a popular option to other types of printers used with computers.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Both dyes and pigments have been used as ink colorants for ink jet printers.
      <br/>
      The dye-based inks while in general superior in color properties have several disadvantages as compared to pigment based inks.
      <br/>
      The dyes are usually water soluble and remain so after drying on the substrate.
      <br/>
      They are easily redissolved by water spills, and the image smears on contact with felt pen markers.
      <br/>
      In addition, the dyes exhibit poor light stability relative to pigments and are known to fade even under office lighting.
      <br/>
      Thus, dye-based inks are often unsuitable for use in applications requiring moisture resistance and greater light stability.
      <br/>
      The pigments are preferred colorants provided the pigment dispersion can be made resistant to flocculation and settling.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Water-based pigment dispersions are well known in the art, and have been used commercially for applying films, such as paints, to various substrates.
      <br/>
      The pigment dispersion is generally stabilized by either a non-ionic or ionic technique.
      <br/>
      When using the non-ionic technique, the pigment particles are stabilized by a polymer that has a water-soluble, hydrophilic section that extends into the water and provides entropic or steric stabilization.
      <br/>
      Representative polymers useful for this purpose include polyvinyl alcohol, cellulosics, ethylene oxide modified phenols, and ethylene oxide/propylene oxide polymers.
      <br/>
      While the non-ionic technique is not sensitive to pH changes or ionic contamination, it has a major disadvantage for many applications in that the final product is water sensitive.
      <br/>
      Thus, if used in ink applications or the like, the ink will tend to smear upon exposure to moisture.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      There exists a need for ink jet inks which have good water and smear fastness.
      <br/>
      In particular, with pigment based inks there is a need to maintain the stability of the dispersion while improving water and smear fastness.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">In accordance with this invention, there is provided an aqueous ink jet ink composition comprising:</p>
    <p num="7">
      (A) an aqueous vehicle;
      <br/>
      (B) a colorant; and
      <br/>
      (C) an additive selected from the group consisting of alkoxysilane binder additive.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The compositions have excellent water and smear fastness, print quality and they have excellent dispersion stability.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The ink compositions of this invention comprise an aqueous vehicle, a colorant (i.e., a dye or pigment) and an alkoxysilane binder additive.
      <br/>
      The inks may also contain other additives as is known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Aqueous Vehicle</p>
    <p num="11">
      The aqueous vehicle is water, or a mixture of water and at least one water soluble organic solvent.
      <br/>
      Deionized water is commonly used.
      <br/>
      Selection of a suitable mixture of water and water soluble organic solvent depends upon requirements of the specific application, such as desired surface tension and viscosity, the selected colorant and the drying time of the ink.
      <br/>
      Water-soluble organic solvents are well known, representative examples of which are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,085,698, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      A mixture of a water soluble organic solvent having at least 2 hydroxyl groups, e.g, diethylene glycol, and deionized water is preferred as the aqueous vehicle.
      <br/>
      In the event that a mixture of water and organic solvent is used as the aqueous vehicle, water would comprise between 25% and 99%, preferably 45% to 95%, by weight of the aqueous medium, based on the total combined weight of the aqueous vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Colorants</p>
    <p num="13">
      The colorants useful in the present invention may be a pigment or a dye.
      <br/>
      A pigment is a colorant that is remains in a crystalline or particulate state throughout the printing process.
      <br/>
      A dye is a colorant that is soluble at some point in the printing process, even if it is insoluble in the aqueous vehicle at room temperature.
      <br/>
      If a pigment is used as the colorant, which is preferred, a dispersing agent, preferably a polymeric dispersant, will also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Pigments:</p>
    <p num="15">
      Useful pigments for the dispersion comprise a wide variety of organic and inorganic pigments, alone or in combination.
      <br/>
      The pigment particles are sufficiently small to permit free flow of the ink through the ink jet printing device, especially at the ejecting nozzles.
      <br/>
      Small particles are also desirable for dispersion stability and maximum color strength.
      <br/>
      The range of useful particle size is approximately 0.005 micron to 15 micron.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the pigment particle size should range from 0.005 to 5 micron and most preferably, from 0.01 to 0.3 micron.
      <br/>
      Representative commercial dry and presscake pigments that may be used in practicing the invention, including metals and metal oxides, are disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,085,698, which is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In the case of organic pigments, the ink may contain up to approximately 30% pigment by weight, but will generally be in the range of approximately 0.1 to 15%, preferably approximately 0.1 to 8%, by weight of the total ink composition for most thermal ink jet printing applications.
      <br/>
      If an inorganic pigment is selected, the ink will tend to contain higher weight percentages of pigment than with comparable inks employing organic pigment, and may be as high as approximately 75% in some cases, because inorganic pigments generally have higher specific gravity than organic pigments.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Polymeric dispersants are the preferred dispersants for pigments.
      <br/>
      Polymeric dispersants suitable for practicing the invention include random polymers and block polymers and graft polymers.
      <br/>
      Because random polymers are not as effective in stabilizing pigment dispersions as the block copolymers, they are not preferred.
      <br/>
      Suitable block polymer dispersants and the synthesis thereof are disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,085,698 and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,519,085, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference
    </p>
    <p num="18">In addition to, or in place of the polymeric dispersant compounds, surfactant compounds may be used as dispersants as is well known in the art.</p>
    <p num="19">Dyes:</p>
    <p num="20">
      Dyes useful in this invention include anionic, cationic, amphoteric and non-ionic dyes.
      <br/>
      Such dyes are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      Anionic dyes are those dyes which in aqueous solution yield colored anions and cationic dyes are those which in aqueous solution yield colored cations.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Typically anionic dyes contain carboxylic or sulfonic acid groups as the ionic moiety.
      <br/>
      The types of anionic dyes most useful in this invention are for example Acid, Direct, Food, Mordant, and Reactive dyes.
      <br/>
      Anionic dyes are selected from the group consisting of nitroso compounds, nitro compounds, azo compounds, stilbene compounds, triarylmethane compounds, xanthene compounds, quinoline compounds, thiazole compounds, azine compounds, oxazine compounds, thiazine compounds, aminoketone compounds, anthraquinone compounds, indigoid compounds and phthalocyanine compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Cationic dyes usually contain quaternary nitrogen groups.
      <br/>
      The types of cationic dyes that are most useful in this invention include mainly the basic dyes and some of the mordant dyes that are designed to bind acidic sites on a substrate, such as fibers.
      <br/>
      Useful types of such dyes include the azo compounds, diphenylmethane compounds, triarylmethanes, xanthene compounds, acridine compounds, quinoline compounds, methine or polymethine compounds, thiazole compounds, indamine or indophenyl compounds, azine compounds, oxazine compounds, and thiazine compounds, among others, all of which are well known to those skilled in the art.

    <p num="23">
      The color and amount of dye used in the ink composition is largely a function of choice, being primarily dependent upon the desired color of the print achieved with the ink, the purity of the dye and its strength.
      <br/>
      The dye is typically present in the amount of 0.01 to 20%, by weight, preferably 0.05 to 8%, more preferably 1 to 5%, based on the total weight of the ink.

      <br/>
      Suitable alkoxysilanes useful in preparing the binder additives are represented by the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="26">where R=H, methyl or ethyl; R1 =alkyl, aryl, or alkyaryl, preferably an aliphatic group containing 3 carbons; and R2 =alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl, preferably an aliphatic group containing up to 5 carbons.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The alkoxysilane polymer binders can be random, block, graft or branched polymers also contain other monomers such as acrylic and methacrylic monomers, vinyl monomers styrene monomers, etc.
      <br/>
      The binders may also contain acid, amine, anhydride or other functional groups.

    <p num="30">Other Ingredients</p>
    <p num="31">
      The ink may contain other ingredients.
      <br/>
      For example, the surfactants may be used to alter surface tension as well as maximize penetration.
      <br/>
      However, they may also destabilize the pigment dispersion for pigmented inks.
      <br/>
      The choice of a specific surfactant is also highly dependent on the type of media substrate to be printed.
      <br/>
      It is expected that one skilled in the art can select the appropriate surfactant for the specific substrate to be used in printing.
      <br/>
      In aqueous inks, the surfactants may be present in the amount of 0.01-5% and preferably 0.2-2%, based on the total weight of the ink.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Biocides may be used in the ink compositions to inhibit growth of micro-organisms.
      <br/>
      Dowicides.RTM. (Dow Chemical, Midland, Mich.), Nuosept.RTM. (Huls America, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.), Omidines.RTM. (Olin Corp., Cheshire, Conn.), Nopcocides.RTM. (Henkel Corp., Ambler, Pa.), Troysans.RTM. (Troy Chemical Corp., Newark, N.J.) and sodium benzoate are examples of such biocides.
    </p>
    <p num="33">In addition, sequestering agents such as EDTA may also be included to eliminate deleterious effects of heavy metal impurities.</p>
    <p num="34">Other known additives, such as humectants, viscosity modifiers and other acrylic or non-acrylic polymers made also be added to improve various properties of the ink compositions.</p>
    <p num="35">Ink Preparation</p>
    <p num="36">
      The ink compositions of the present invention are prepared in the same manner as other ink jet ink compositions.
      <br/>
      If a pigment dispersion is used as the colorant, the dispersion is prepared by premixing the selected pigment(s) and dispersant in water.
      <br/>
      The dispersion step may be accomplished in a horizontal mini mill, a ball mill, an attritor, or by passing the mixture through a plurality of nozzles within a liquid jet interaction chamber at a liquid pressure of at least 1000 psi to produce a uniform dispersion of the pigment particles in the aqueous vehicle.
      <br/>
      The cosolvents may be present during the dispersion step.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      If a dye is used as the colorant, there is no dispersant present and no need for pigment deaggregation.
      <br/>
      The dye-based ink is prepared in a well agitated vessel rather than in dispersing equipment.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      It is generally desirable to make the ink jet inks in concentrated form, which is subsequently diluted with a suitable liquid to the appropriate concentration for use in the ink jet printing system.
      <br/>
      By dilution, the ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, color, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Jet velocity, separation length of the droplets, drop size, and stream stability are greatly affected by the surface tension and the viscosity of the ink.
      <br/>
      Ink jet inks suitable for use with ink jet printing systems should have a surface tension in the range of about 20 dyne/cm to about 70 dyne/cm and, more preferably, in the range 30 dyne/cm to about 70 dyne/cm at 20 (degree)  C. Acceptable viscosities are no greater than 20 cP, and preferably in the range of about 1.0 cP to about 10.0 cP at 20 (degree)  C. The ink has physical properties compatible with a wide range of ejecting conditions, i.e., driving voltage and pulse width for thermal ink jet printing devices, driving frequency of the piezo element for either a drop-on-demand device or a continuous device, and the shape and size of the nozzle.
      <br/>
      They may be used with a variety of ink jet printers such as continuous, piezoelectric drop-on-demand and thermal or bubble jet drop-on-demand, and are particularly adapted for use in thermal ink jet printers.
      <br/>
      The inks have excellent storage stability for a long period and do not clog in an ink jet apparatus.
      <br/>
      Fixing the ink on the media substrate, such as, paper, fabric, film, etc., can be carried out rapidly and accurately.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The printed ink images have clear color tones, high density, excellent water resistance and lightfastness.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the ink does not corrode parts of the ink jet printing device it comes in contact with, and it is essentially odorless.

    <p num="116">The control and example inks were tested for resistance to smearing or running from either water or highlighters.</p>
    <p num="117">
      In this first set of tests these inks were printed and then evaluated for resistance to water and highlighter smear after 1 hr and 24 hours.
      <br/>
      Some samples after printing were heated to 60 (degree)  C. Resistance to water, called drip, was determined by pouring water across a printed line or page and then observing the amount of ink that ran down the page.
      <br/>
      Resistance to highlighters, called smear, was determined by rubbing either an acidic or a basic highlighter across a printed line or page and then observing the amount of ink that is smeared by the highlighter.
      <br/>
      The printed samples were rated on a scale of 0 to 5 with 0 being best.
      <br/>
      A "0" rating indicates no dripping or smearing from the water or highlighter.
      <br/>
      A rating above 2 is not commercially acceptable.

      In this second set of tests these inks were printed and then evaluated for resistance to water washoff after 0, 1, 4 and 24 hours.
      <br/>
      Some samples were printing on a printer that does not have a heater.
      <br/>
      Others were printed on a printer that has a heater.
      <br/>
      Resistance to water washoff was determined by pouring water across a printed line or page and then measuring the amount of ink, reported as optical density units (O.D.), that runs down the page.
      <br/>
      Lower values of Optical Density drip are desired.
