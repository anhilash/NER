      <br/>
      A magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus having a reproducing circuit structure which improves a high frequency characteristic of a reproduction signal output from a read head.
      <br/>
      The read head reads information recorded on a recording medium.
      <br/>
      A first amplifying circuit amplifies a reproduction signal generated by the read head.
      <br/>
      A second amplifying circuit, which comprises a high-frequency amplifying circuit, amplifies the reproduction signal amplified by the first amplifying circuit in a high-frequency amplifying manner.
      <br/>
      The first amplifying circuit and the second amplifying circuit together constitute a cascode amplifier.
      <br/>
      A third amplifying circuit amplifies the reproduction signal amplified by the second amplifying circuit.
      <br/>
      A reproducing circuit reproduces the reproduction signal amplified by the third amplifying circuit.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention generally relates to an information recording and reproducing apparatus and, more particularly, to a reproducing circuit for a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus which amplifies a reproduction signal generated by a reproducing head and supplies the amplified reproduction signal to a signal processing circuit.</p>
    <p num="3">
      In recent years, a high frequency is used for signals reproduced by a magnetic disc apparatus in order to increase density and transfer speed of data.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is desirous to improve a high-frequency characteristic of a reproducing circuit which amplifies a signal generated by a magnetic head.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      On the other hand, in the magnetic disc apparatus, the reproduction signal output from the magnetic head is supplied to a head IC through a transmission line such as a CAPS, a lead wire or a flexible pattern circuit (FPC), and the signal is amplified by the head IC.
      <br/>
      Such a transmission line has a capacitance and, thereby, the high-frequency characteristic of the reproduction signal is deteriorated and a cutoff frequency is decreased.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the high frequency characteristic of the reproduction signal is also deteriorated due to a frequency characteristic of the head IC.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Accordingly, it is desirous to improve the high frequency characteristic of the transmission line and the head IC so as to achieve an accurate transfer of the reproduction signal from the reproducing head to the head IC.</p>

      <br/>
      The pull-up circuit 109 pulls up the output of the head IC 108 and supplies the output to the RDC 110.

    <p num="15">
      FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram of the pull-up circuit 109.

      <br/>
      An end of each of the pull-up resistors R1 and R2 is connected to a power source line Vcc, and the other end of each of the pull-up resistors R1 and R2 is connected to the head IC 108 so as to pull up an output signal.

    <p num="16">
      The RDC 110 demodulates the signal supplied from the head IC 108 via the pull-up circuit 109.
      <br/>
      The signal demodulated by the RDC 110 is supplied to a microprocessor unit (MPU) 111 (refer to FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The MPU 111 is connected to the RDC 110, a digital signal processor (DSP) 112 and a hard disc drive connector (HDC) 113. The MPU 111 processes information recorded on or reproduced from the magnetic disc 101.

      The MPU 111 also controls a rotation of the magnetic disc 101 and positioning of the magnetic head 103 in accordance with the information read from the magnetic disc 101 by the magnetic head 103.

      Additionally, the DSP 112 generates digital data for controlling operation of the voice coil motor 106 in accordance with digital data supplied by the MPU 111 which determines a position of the magnetic head 103.
      <br/>
      The digital data for controlling the rotational speed of the spindle motor 102 and the digital data for controlling the operation of the voice coil motor 106 are supplied to a digital analog converter (DAC) 114. The DAC 114 converts the digital data for controlling the spindle motor 102 into an analog signal, and supplies the analog signal to a spindle motor (SPM) drive circuit 115.
      <br/>
      The SPM drive circuit 115 generates a drive signal for driving the spindle motor 102, and supplies it to the spindle motor 102.
      <br/>
      Thus, the spindle motor 102 is rotated by the drive signal so that the magnetic disc 101 rotates in the direction indicated by the arrow A. The DAC 114 also converts the digital data for controlling the voice coil motor 106 into an analog signal, and supplies the analog signal to a voice coil motor (VCM) drive circuit 116.

      The VCM drive circuit 116 generates a drive signal for driving the voice coil motor 106, and supplies it to the voice coil motor 106.

      Thus, the voice coil motor 106 is operated by the drive signal so that the arm 104 is moved in the directions indicated by the arrows B so as to locate the magnetic head 103 at a designated position.

      Thus, the connection line between the magnetic head 103 and the head IC 108 is relatively long.
      <br/>
      Each of the lead wire 107a and the FPC 107b has a capacitance which may decrease a cutoff frequency for the reproduction signal.
      <br/>
      That is, the capacitance of the lead wire 107a and the FPC 107b deteriorates the high-frequency characteristic of the signal transmission line.
