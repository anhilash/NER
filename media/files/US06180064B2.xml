      A gas sensor comprising a pair of electrodes.
      <br/>
      The gas sensor includes one or more semiconducting organic polymers deposited between the pair of electrodes in such a manner as to effect a semiconducting electrical connection therebetween.
      <br/>
      The gas sensor also includes a device for applying an electric signal across the electrodes and a detector for detecting a chosen electrical property across the electrodes in the presence of a gas.
      <br/>
      At least one of the semiconducting organic polymers is polymerized from a monomer comprising a five membered heterocyclic aromatic ring with substituent groups at the 2 and 5 positions.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to semiconducting organic polymers which may be used in gas sensors.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      It is known that certain electrochemically prepared semiconducting polymers such as polypyrrole may be employed in sensors in order to detect gases, vapors and odors.
      <br/>
      Such a sensor may comprise a pair of electrodes mounted on a substrate, with a layer of the semiconducting organic polymer deposited on and between the electrodes in order to produce an electrical connection between the electrodes.
      <br/>
      The semiconducting organic polymer may be sensitive to the presence of a gas or, more likely, to a range of gases, to the extent that adsorption of the gas onto the polymer surface affects the electrical properties of the polymer.
      <br/>
      Hence the presence of gas may be detected by monitoring, for example, the change in DC resistance of the sensor on exposure to the gas.
      <br/>
      For instance, Maisik et al (Maisik, J J, Hooper, A and Tofield, B C) JCS Faraday Trans. 1, 1986, 82, 1117-26 demonstrated a polypyrrole gas sensor displaying a DC resistance which was sensitive to the presence of nitrous oxide and hydrogen sulphide.
      <br/>
      GB-2,203,553-B discloses an improved method of detection wherein various AC impedance characteristics are measured at different AC frequencies.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      A given semiconducting organic polymer will typically be sensitive to a range of compounds.
      <br/>
      Clearly this lack of selectivity is a major problem if one wishes to develop a sensor which is specific to a particular gas.
      <br/>
      Conversely, a sensor which employs a given semiconducting organic polymer may not be sufficiently sensitive to such a broad range of gases that it may be considered a general purpose device.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="4">
      A solution to these problems is a device which employs a plurality of sensors, wherein each sensor incorporates a different polymer and each polymer possesses differing gas response profiles.
      <br/>
      Thus a suite of polymers may be selected which possess broadly overlapping responses, but which are individually chemically tailored to enhance differences in response to certain molecules or classes of molecules.
      <br/>
      Often the variation of a substituent group on the monomer unit is sufficient to enable such "fine tuning" of response.
      <br/>
      A multi-sensor device detects gases and odors as a characteristic pattern of individual responses across the array of sensors.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The present invention relates to a class of semiconducting organic polymers based on 1, 2, 5 substituted five membered heterocyclic aromatic ring monomer units.
      <br/>
      The substituent groups at the 2 and 5 positions are preferably aromatic rings; in particular, thienyl or thienyl derivatives appear to confer enhanced stability to the resulting polymer.

      Further substitution at the 3 position of the ring may be desirable.

      By judicious variation of the substituent groups, a range of semiconducting polymers for use in gas sensors of the type described above can be produced, wherein the response profile of a polymer can be "fine tuned" to a molecule or a class of molecules.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="19">
      FIGS. 1 and 2 show an embodiment of a gas sensor based on a modified 40 pin silicon chip carrier 10 (Hybritek 40 L CC), wherein the gold pins 12 of the carrier are patterned onto a ceramic substrate 14.
      <br/>
      Adjacent pins 14a and 16a act as electrodes, and a layer of a semiconducting organic polymer 18 is deposited so that there is a semiconducting electrical connection between the electrodes 14a and 16a.
      <br/>
      The electrodes are connected to plugs 14b and 16b, located on the underside of the chip carrier 10.
      <br/>
      Leads are attached to the plugs 14b and 16b in order to apply a DC potential across the electrodes 14a and 16a and the resistance of this electrical circuit is measured by known means (see, for example, B A Gregory; "An Introduction to Electrical Instrumentation and Measurement Systems", 1982, MacMillen).
      <br/>
      When the sensor is exposed to a gas to which the polymer is sensitive, the presence of the gas is detected by a variation in the DC resistance of the circuit.
      <br/>
      The semiconducting organic polymer is polymerized from a monomer which comprises a five membered aromatic heterocyclic ring, the ring having at least two substituent groups wherein one substituent group is appended at the 2 position and another substituent group is appended at the 5 position.
      <br/>
      Suitable heterocyclic rings are pyrrole, thiophene and furan.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In order to produce a polymer which displays responses to certain classes of molecules which are close to those responses desired, it is necessary to effect further substitution of the monomer at the heteroatom.
      <br/>
      The heteroatom substituent group is not limited in scope and may be, for instance, alkyl, acyl or aryl.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Similarly, it may be desirable to employ a polymer wherein the monomer is further substituted at the 3 position on the heterocyclic ring.
      <br/>
      The nature of the substituent group is not limited in scope.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A preferred choice as the five membered heterocyclic aromatic ring is pyrrole, and preferred substituents at the 2 and 5 positions are further aromatic rings.
      <br/>
      The reason for the latter preference is that the polymerization of unsubstituted pyrrole proceeds almost exclusively via linkage at the 2 and 5 positions, and therefore it is possible to inhibit polymerization if the substituents at these positions do not themselves participate in the polymerization process.
      <br/>
      The aromatic ring substituents may themselves be derivatized.
      <br/>
      A class of monomer which has proved particularly useful is N-substituted 2,5-Di(2-thienyl)-pyrrole.
      <br/>
      Polymers based on this monomer unit have proved to be particularly stable when employed in gas sensors.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The synthesis of 2,5-Di-(2-thienyl)-pyrrole and N-substituted derivatives thereof is shown in FIG. 3. 3-dimethylamino-1-(2-thienyl)-propanone hydrochloride (4) is produced in 89% yield by refluxing for 16 hours a mixture of 2-acetylthiophene (1), paraformaldehyde (2), dimethylamine hydrochloride (3) and concentrated hydrochloric acid in ethanol.
      <br/>
      The product is isolated, treated with 35% aqueous ammonia and extracted with ether to yield 3-dimethylamino-1-(2-thienyl)-propanone (5).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      A solution of 2-thiophene carboxaldehyde (6) in DMF is added under nitrogen to a suspension of sodium cyanide in DMF.
      <br/>
      The mixture is stirred and the 3-dimethylamino-1-(2-thienyl)-propanone (5) is added slowly.
      <br/>
      The mixture is allowed to stand overnight and the 1,4-Di-(2-thienyl)-1,4-butanedione product (7) is extracted with dichloromethane in 64% yield. 2,5,-Di-(2-thienyl)-pyrrole (DTP) can be produced in 80% yield by refluxing (7) for 12 hours with ammonium acetate in a mixture of acetic acid and acetic anhydride.
      <br/>
      The acid acts as a catalyst and the anhydride as a water scavenger which drives the equilibrium reaction towards the desired product.
      <br/>
      An N-substituted derivative of 2,5-DTP (9) may be produced by using an appropriate primary amine instead of ammonium acetate.
      <br/>
      The yield of (9) is often comparable to that of 2,5-DTP but does exhibit some dependence on the substituent group R; in particular, if R is bulky the yield may decrease substantially.
      <br/>
      Where appropriate, yields may be improved by the use of a benzene/acetic acid solvent system thus allowing the azeotropic removal of water from the reaction mixture by attaching a Dean-Stark trap.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a stronger acid catalyst such as titanium (IV) chloride can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In order to produce the polymer in its conducting form an electrochemical polymerisation process is employed.
      <br/>
      The polymerization may be carried out by electrolytic oxidation of the monomer in an electrochemical cell.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows the electrolytic oxidation of 2,5-Di-(2-thienyl)pyrrole in an electrochemical cell 40.
      <br/>
      The chip carrier 10 is connected, at plugs 14b and 16b, to the anode 42 of the cell 40.
      <br/>
      The cell 40 also comprises a cathode 44, a standard calomel reference electrode 46 and is flushed with nitrogen through ports 48.
      <br/>
      The anode 42 is at 1.3 V with respect to the reference electrode 46.
      <br/>
      The electrolyte comprises 0.01 M 2,5-Di-(2-thienyl)pyrrole and 0.1 M tetraethylammonium p-toluenesulphonate in a 99% acetonitrile/1% water medium.
      <br/>
      The further substituted variants are typically polymerized under similar conditions: the monomer concentration is typically between 0.01-0.1 M, and the solvent mixture is typically as described above, although a 50% dichloromethane, 49.5% acetonitrile, 0.5% water mixture is sometimes employed.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In solution the tetraethylammonium p-toluenesulphonate yields the tosylate anion, which is incorporated into the polymer film during polymerization as a counter-ion to ensure overall electrical neutrality in the polymer.
      <br/>
      Other counter-ions may be employed including, for example, BF4-, PF6-, ClO4-, C8 H17 SO3- or Fe(CN)63-. Variation of the counter-ion is another means by which the response characteristics of a polymer may be moderated.
