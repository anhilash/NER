    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="17">
      While the present invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown, it is to be understood at the outset of the description which follows that persons of skill in the appropriate arts may modify the invention here described while still achieving the favorable results of this invention.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the description which follows is to be understood as being a broad, teaching disclosure directed to persons of skill in the appropriate arts, and not as limiting upon the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 1, a heat sink 10 is attached to a semiconductor module 20 by means of a clip 30.
      <br/>
      To this end, a plurality of holes 22 are formed on the upper side of the semiconductor module 20 while both ends of the clip 30 is provided with latches 32 held by the holes.
      <br/>
      Firstly, after placing the heat sink 10 over the semiconductor module 20, the clip 30 is positioned over the heat sink 10 with the latches 32 facing the respective holes 22 of the semiconductor module 20, as shown in the cross sectional view of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Then, pushing the clip 30 towards the heat sink 10, the latches 32 are tightly inserted into the holes 22 to fixedly attach the heat sink 10 to the semiconductor module 20.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, in order to remove the heat sink 10 from the semiconductor module 20, the latches 32 are slightly spread by using a detaching tool such as a sharp pole inserted into a lug 34 formed on the clip 30 so as to be pulled out of the holes 22.
      <br/>
      Then, pulling the clip 30 upwards, the heat sink 10 may be detached from the semiconductor module 20.
    </p>
    <p num="19">As described above, such clip 30 fixes the heat sink 10 on the semiconductor module by means of its resilience, suffering the following drawbacks:</p>
    <p num="20">
      Firstly, a considerable force should be exerted to the clip 30 when attaching or detaching it to or from the semiconductor module 20.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the detaching tool is required for the detaching of the clip 30 from the semiconductor module 20.
      <br/>
      Secondly, the clamping force of the clip 30 is so weak that the thermal conductivity between the heat sink 10 and the semiconductor module 20 is inadequate, and that the heat sink 10 may be inadvertently detached from the semiconductor module 20 by a small external impact.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Throughout the attached drawings are used the same reference numerals to represent the same functional parts.
      <br/>
      The inventive device may be preferably used to attach a heat sink to a microprocessor such as Intel Pentium II.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, a semiconductor module 50 has an upper plane side contacting a heat sink 40 and a lower connector side connected to a printed circuit board.
      <br/>
      The upper plane side is provided with holes, which are positioned along two sides of the heat sink 40 mounted on the semiconductor module 50.
      <br/>
      The heat sink 40 is preferably made of a material having good thermal conductivity such as aluminum.
      <br/>
      The heat sink 40 has a first surface contacting the upper plane side of the semiconductor module 50 and a second surface formed with a plurality of heat radiating fins 42.
      <br/>
      A clip 60 is mounted on the second surface of the heat sink 40.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Describing the inventive device for attaching the heat sink to the semiconductor module with reference to FIG. 3, it comprises the clip 60, a lever 70, and support 80.
      <br/>
      The clip 60 includes first hinge lugs 62, lever holding seats 64, and stoppers 65.
      <br/>
      The clip 60 has both ends 66 vertically bent with hooks 68 respectively connected with the holes 52.
      <br/>
      The stoppers 65 are to limit the movement of the lever 70 which is swung to detach the heat sink 40 from the semiconductor module.
      <br/>
      The lever 70 is hinged on the clip 60 by the first hinge lugs 62 associated with one end of the lever 70, whose other end is provided with a handle 72 to enable the user to easily operate the lever.
      <br/>
      The lever 70 is additionally provided with first and second fixing lugs 76 and 78.
      <br/>
      The first fixing lugs 76 are respectively held by the lever holding seats 64 when the lever 70 is swung to lock the support 80 to press the heat sink 40 against the semiconductor module 50, as shown in FIG. 5B. The second fixing lugs 78 are resiliently held by the clip 60 in order to properly limit the movement of the lever 70 when it is swung to release the support 80 and thus the heat sink 40 from the semiconductor module 50, as shown in FIG. 5A. The support 80 is hinged on second hinge lugs 74 of the lever 70, so that the support 80 attaches or detaches the heat sink 40 to or from the semiconductor module 50 by swinging the lever 70.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Hereinafter will be described the sequential steps of attaching the heat sink to the semiconductor module with reference to FIGS. 5A to 5C. First placing the heat sink 40 on the upper plane surface of the semiconductor module 50, the clip 60 is positioned over the heat sink with the hooks 68 respectively inserted in the holes 52, as shown in FIG. 5A. In this case, the lever 70 takes preferably the vertical position.
      <br/>
      When the lever 70 is swung in the locked direction "a" by means of the handle 72, the support 80 descends downwards to press the second surface of the heat sink 40 against the semiconductor module.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5B shows that the lever is completely swung towards the locked direction to press the heat sink 40 against the semiconductor module.
      <br/>
      The heat sink 40 is tightly contacted with the upper plane surface of the semiconductor module 50.
      <br/>
      Finally, the lever 70 is slightly pushed towards the direction of arrow "b" as shown in FIG. 5B to keep the lever 70 in that locked position.
      <br/>
      This is achieved with the first fixing lugs 76 held by the lever holding seats 64, as shown in FIG. 5C. There is shown in FIG. 6 the heat sink 40 fastened with the semiconductor module 50 mounted on the printed circuit board 100.
      <br/>
      The printed circuit board 100 can be a computer's main board or a computer's mother board, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      On the contrary, detaching the heat sink 40 from the semiconductor module 50, the first fixing lugs 76 are firstly separated from the lever holding seats 64 by moving the lever 70 towards the opposite direction to that of arrow "b" shown in FIG. 5B. Then, the lever 70 is swung to the released position so that the support 80 rises upwards detached from the second surface of the heat sink 40.
      <br/>
      Thus, the clip 60 may be removed from the semiconductor module 50.
      <br/>
