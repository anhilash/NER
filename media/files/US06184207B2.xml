    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to certain novel peptides which possess pharmacologically useful properties for use in treating autoimmune diseases or medical conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and other MHC class II dependent T-cell mediated diseases.
      <br/>
      The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions of the novel peptides, processes for their manufacture, and their use in treating one or more of the aforementioned diseases or medical conditions and in the production of novel pharmaceuticals for use in such medical treatments.

    <p num="2">
      Stimulation of the human immune response is dependent on the recognition of protein antigens by T cells.
      <br/>
      However T cells cannot respond to antigen alone and are only triggered by antigen when it is complexed with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of an antigen presenting cell, such as a B cell, macrophage or dendritic cell.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      MHC class I molecules elicit a T-killer cell response which results in the destruction of the cell bearing the antigen.
      <br/>
      MHC class II molecules elicit a T-helper cell response which controls the expansion and maturation of selected B cells (i.e. antigen-specific antibodies) and activation of macrophages.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A critical requirement of the immune system is the ability to differentiate between "self" and "non-self" (i.e. foreign) antigens.
      <br/>
      This discrimination is required to enable the immune system to mount a response to invading foreign pathogens whilst maintaining tolerance to self-proteins and thereby preventing damage to normal tissues.
      <br/>
      An autoimmune disease results when self-tolerance breaks down allowing the immune system to react against self-tissues such as the joints in rheumatoid arthritis.
      <br/>
      It is thought that the maintenance of tolerance and thus avoidance of autoimmune disease is critically dependent on the function of MHC molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The observation that many autoimmune diseases are linked to the inheritance of particular MHC alleles suggests a key role for MHC molecules in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease.
      <br/>
      For instance multiple sclerosis is linked to the inheritance of HLA-DR2, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus to HLA-DR3 and/or HLA-DR4 and Hashimoto's thyroiditis to HLA-DR5.
      <br/>
      In particular, an especially strong association exists between predisposition to development of the chronic inflammatory joint disease rheumatoid arthritis and the inheritance of HLA-DR4Dw4 and/or HLA-DR4wl4 and/or HLA-DR1.
      <br/>
      It is thought that the autoimmune disease associated MHC molecules bind to certain self-antigens and present them to T cells thus stimulating an autoimmune response.
      <br/>
      Other peptides which can bind to the autoimmune associated MHC molecules and/or either prevent the binding or displace already bound self-antigens and/or which inhibit T cell activation (especially the activity of pathogenic T-cells (e.g. Th 1 cells)) and/or which increase the activity of protective T-cells (e.g. Th 2 cells) or peptides which interact with MHC molecules by an alternative mechanism of action so as to prevent or modify stimulation of an autoimmune response mediated via said MHC molecules, may specifically suppress an autoimmune response.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      An agent of this kind would offer therapy for the autoimmune disease whilst avoiding general suppression of the immune system, thus limiting deleterious side-effects.
      <br/>
      This kind of profile would have significant advantages over current therapy for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
      <br/>
      It is contemporary practice to treat rheumatoid arthritis initially with symptom relief agents such as NSAIDs, which do not have anv beneficial effect on disease progression and are often associated with unwanted side-effects.
      <br/>
      Treatment of more severe disease relies on the use of the so-called second-line agents.
      <br/>
      Often these are general cytotoxic compounds which are of limited efficacy and can cause severe toxicity problems.
      <br/>
      A rationally based, disease modifying agent, without associated non-specific cytotoxicity, would therefore offer significant benefits in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

    <p num="7">Peptides are disclosed in International Patent Application, Publication No's WO 92/02543, WO 93/05011 and WO 95/07707 which bind to MHC molecules and inhibit T-cell activation.</p>
    <p num="8">Although a number of peptides have been discovered which inhibit HLA-DR restricted T cell activation by binding to HLA-DR molecules, there is a continuing need for alternative compounds which bind to such molecules and/or either prevent the binding of self antigens or displace already bound self-antigens and/or inhibit T cell activation and/or increase the activity of protective T-cells, or which interact with MHC molecules by an alternative mechanism of action, so as to prevent or modify stimulation of an autoimmune response that cause a disease or condition referred to above.</p>
    <p num="9">We have discovered that the peptides of the present invention (set out below) surprisingly possess such pharmacologically useful properties and this is a basis for the present invention.</p>
    <p num="10">According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a peptide of the formula I (set out hereinafter)</p>

    <p num="12">
      either AA3 together with AA4, or AA4 together with AA5, or AA6 together with AA7 form a group of the formula II (set out hereinafter) in which Ra is selected from hydrogen and (1-4C)alkyl, and the remainder of AA1, AA2, AA3, AA4, AA5, AA6, AA7 and AA8 are L-amino acid residues;

    <p num="13">- A1 is selected from</p>
    <p num="14">

      <br/>
      -  (2) a group of the formula -A3 -B3 --C3 - in which A3 is methylene, B3 is p-phenylene or 1,4-cyclohexylene and C3 is (1-3C)alkylene; and

      Q is 1-piperazinyl, 4-methyl-1-piperazinyl, 4-amidino-1-piperazinyl, 4-(2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl)-1-piperazinyl, 1-piperidyl or 4-substituted-1-piperidyl wherein the 4-substitutent is selected from carboxy, carbamoyl, N-(2-aminoethyl)carbamoyl and N-(4-aminobutyl)carbamoyl, or

      Q is a sequence of 1 to 6 amino acids or an amide thereof; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      It is to be understood that an amino acid of Q may independently have the D- or L-stereochemistry.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, when Q is defined as hydroxy (OH), this will be understood to be the hydroxy group of the C-terminal amino acid of AA8.
      <br/>
      Similarly where Q is defined as NH2, NRcRd, piperazinyl, piperidyl, etc., this means that the hydroxy group of the C-terminal amino acid AA8 is replaced by such a group.
      <br/>
      It is also to be understood that where an amino acid is referred to this means an alpha-amino acid.
      <br/>
      It is also to be understood that when an L-amino acid is referred to this also includes amino acids such as Gly, 2,2-diethylGly. aza-alanine and aza-glycine which have no chiral carbon atom.
      <br/>
      It is further to be understood that generic terms such as "alkyl" include both straight and branched chain variants when the carbon numbers permit.
      <br/>
      The same convention applies to other radicals.

    <p num="16">
      It is well known in the art that compounds having a chiral centre may exist in the form of a racemate (or a mixture of diastereoisomers where there is more than one chiral centre) or as an optically active enantiomer or diastercoisomer.
      <br/>
      It is also well known in the art that a particular biological activity associated with a racemic or diastereomeric mixture may result largely or solely from a single optically active isomer.
      <br/>
      It will therefore be understood that the invention concerns any form of a peptide of formula I which possesses the aforementioned pharmaceutically useful properties.
      <br/>
      It is well known in the art how to obtain a single optically active isomer, for example by separation from a racemic or diastereomeric mixture containing the isomer using conventional techniques, such as chromatography, or by chiral synthesis using an appropriate optically active starting material or intermediate, as exemplified herein.
      <br/>
      It is also well known in the art how to determine the pharmacological properties of such racemic or diastereomeric mixtures, and the individual optically active isomers, for example by using the assays described herein.
      <br/>
      The person skilled in the art is therefore easily able to obtain the particular isomers of the peptides of formula I having the beneficial pharmacological properties referred to herein.

      <br/>
      The group of formula II is incorporated into the sequence by using an appropriately protected (3-amino-2-oxopiperidin-1-yl)alkanoic acid, obtained, for example, as described in the Examples (or by analogy therewith), in place of a protected amino acid.
      <br/>
      The protected or unprotected polypeptide is released from the solid support by standard procedures, for example using a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid, tricthylsilane and water.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that a side-chain protecting group may be cleaved under the conditions used to release the peptide from the solid support, or may be cleaved as a separate step prior or subsequent to release of the peptide from the solid support.
      <br/>
      It will also be appreciated that the procedure to build up the polypeptide may be modified by using a sequence of two or more suitable protected amino acids in a particular coupling step.
      <br/>
      The synthesis may use manual techniques or be carried out automatically, employing for example, an Applied Biosystems 431A or 430A peptide synthesiser or Advanced Chemtech ACT357 peptide synthesiser or similar automatic peptide synthesiser, or a combination of both techniques can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      During the assembly of the peptides, the amino acid functional groups not taking part in the reaction are protected by various functional groups.
      <br/>
      For example, the N-terminal and side chain amino groups may be protected by using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), biphenylisopropoxycarbonyl (Bpoc), 2-�3.5-dimethoxyphenyl�propyl-2-oxycarbonyl (Ddz), adamantyloxycarbonyl (Adoc), allyloxycarbonyl (Aloc), 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Troc), benzyloxycarbonyl and various substituted benzyloxycarbonyl groups.
      <br/>
      These protecting groups can be cleaved when required by the standard techniques (e.g. acid or base treatment, catalytic hydrogenolysis and Pd(0) treatment or zinc/acetic acid treatment).
    </p>
    <p num="69">Suitable protecting groups used for the protection of the side chain guanidino group in the peptides containing an arginine residue include a nitro, adamantyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylbenzenesulphonyl (Mtr), 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulphonyl (Pmc) and (especially) 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulphonyl (Pbf) group.</p>
    <p num="70">
      Suitable protecting groups used for the protection of a side chain hydroxy group include t-butyl, benzyl and trityl (Trt).
      <br/>
      Suitable protecting groups used for the side chain imidazole group in the peptides containing a histidine residue, include a trityl, benzyl, tosyl, dinitrophenyl, Adoc, Boc or Fmoc group.
    </p>
    <p num="71">Suitable protecting groups used for the protection of a side chain carboxyl group include various esters (e.g. methyl, ethyl, t-butyl, benzyl, nitrobenzyl, allyl and 9-fluorenylmethyl).</p>
    <p num="72">The protecting group cleavage reactions can be performed at temperatures in the range of 4 (degree)  C. to 40 (degree)  C. (preferably at or about ambient temperature) and over a period of time in the range of 10 minutes to 24 hours.</p>
    <p num="73">
      Suitable coupling methods used for the coupling of the individual amino acids include the commonly used azide, symmetrical anhydride, mixed anhydride and various active esters and carbodiimides.
      <br/>
      In the case of various carbodiimides (e.g. dicyclohexyl- or diisopropyl-carbodiimides), a number of additives (e.g. 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) and N-hydroxysuccinimde) may also be added.
      <br/>
      In addition, the amino acid couplings can also be achieved by using a number of other reagents, e.g. 1H-benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), (2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) and (2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (HBTU).
      <br/>
      The coupling reactions can be performed at temperatures in the range of -20 (degree)  C. and 40 (degree)  C. and over a period of time in the range of 10 minutes to 24 hours.
      <br/>
      A suitable medium for carrying out the coupling reactions includes, for example, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).
      <br/>
      A particularly suitable method includes the use of HBTU, HOBT and diisopropylethylamine in DMF.

      A typical procedure for measuring the stability of a peptide of the present invention is as follows, in which, to minimize microbial contamination and degradation, all equipment that is used to prepare peptide solutions is sterilized in an autoclave and all material transfers carried out in a Class II laminar flow cabinet.
      <br/>
      Approximately 20 ml of McIlvaine's citric acid-phosphate buffer solution at pH 3 or 7.6 containing 0.02% sodium azide is filtered into a 50 ml bottle using a sterile 0.22  MU m filter unit and a 20 ml syringe.
      <br/>
      Approximately 1.2 mg of peptide is accurately weighed in a capped vial.

      Using a sterile pipette tip, sufficient buffer solution is added to the peptide in the vial to give a peptide concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The vial is capped and shaken to dissolve the peptide.
      <br/>
      Using a sterile pipette tip, aliquots of approximately 1 ml of the peptide solution are transferred to 10 HPLC vials, which are then capped. 5 vials are stored at -18 and 37 (degree)  C. The area of the peptide peak for the solution is determined by HPLC using appropriate standards initially and after storage at -18 and 37 (degree)  C. for 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks. using a fresh vial at each time point with duplicate sample injections.
      <br/>
      The percentage of peptide remaining after storage at 37 (degree)  C. at each time point is determined from the ratio of the area of the peptide peak at each time point to the initial area.
