    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The invention is an apparatus and method for providing a high-linearity, low-spread variable capacitance array which can be coupled to a wide variety of electronic circuits.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the invention provides a variable capacitance array which can be used to modify the operation of an oscillator circuit.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The communications industry has continually struggled to provide communication equipment at affordable prices.
      <br/>
      Such communication equipment can include by way of example, mobile and wireless devices such as radios, cellular telephones, cordless phones and the like.
      <br/>
      Such devices, however, typically operate within narrow frequency ranges with little tolerance for error.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In order to operate at the desired frequencies, such devices often rely on oscillator circuits.
      <br/>
      Oscillator circuits vibrate or resonate at desired frequencies.
      <br/>
      A variety of oscillator circuits exist, some of which use transistor networks, feedback circuits, piezoelectric substances and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventional systems typically tune an oscillator by varying the amount of capacitance coupled to the oscillator with what are called variable capacitors.
      <br/>
      In general, a variable capacitor allows one to select a desired capacitive value from a range of capacitive values.
      <br/>
      For example, adjusting the capacitive value in a variable capacitor alters the amount of capacitance coupled to the oscillator.
      <br/>
      As a result, the capacitive value modifies the operating frequency of the oscillator.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In many applications, it is desirable to provide a variable capacitor which can be finely tuned.
      <br/>
      Fine tuning allows a circuit designer to precisely select the value of the variable capacitor with relatively small incremental adjustments.
      <br/>
      In many conventional variable capacitors, however, the incremental adjustments may not be linear, that is, an incremental change may not be proportionately similar to the previous or following incremental change.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In addition to fine tuned precision, circuit designers also desire the ability to select from a large range of capacitance values.
      <br/>
      A variable capacitor which provides a relatively wide range of values is said to have a relatively large dynamic range.
      <br/>
      The large dynamic range is typically achieved by combining capacitors.
      <br/>
      The ratio of the largest capacitor to the smallest capacitor is often called the capacitance spread.
      <br/>
      A high-spread capacitance array combines large capacitance values with small capacitance values.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in a low-spread capacitance array, the largest capacitor value is closer in value to the smallest capacitor value.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Other applications often need variable capacitors which are stable.
      <br/>
      That is, once selected, the capacitance value remains relatively constant.
      <br/>
      In many conventional variable capacitors, however, the value of the selected capacitance can vary due to changes in temperature, operating parameters and external influences.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      One common type of variable capacitor used in the communications industry is a varactor diode.
      <br/>
      In order to improve the performance of varactor diodes, the communications industry has, in some cases, added circuitry to more accurately control the varactor diodes.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, varactor diodes are non-linear, thus fine tuning can be difficult to implement.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the dynamic range of a varactor diode is dependent on the power supply voltage.
      <br/>
      The larger the power supply voltage, the larger the dynamic range.
      <br/>
      Thus, to provide a large dynamic range requires higher voltages.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In addition, conventional varactor diodes and their control circuits are often more sensitive to power fluctuations, can dissipate more power and can add additional weight, can increase manufacturing costs and can consume additional space.
      <br/>
      As can be appreciated, designers of electronic circuits and particularly designers of hand-held communications devices, desire to improve operating performance, decrease power dissipation, conserve space and reduce weight.

    <p num="11">
      One embodiment of the invention also provides a variable capacitor with increased stability.
      <br/>
      Thus, the embodiment reduces the amount the capacitance varies or drifts over time.
      <br/>
      The increased stability improves performance in so called noisy environments wherein operating parameters often fluctuate.
      <br/>
      Still further, the increased stability improves performance in low cost systems which may use less reliable components.

    <p num="12">
      One embodiment also reduces the number of components required to provide variable capacitors.
      <br/>
      For example, some embodiments eliminate components such as varactor diodes.
      <br/>
      As a result, the invention reduces the cost of manufacturing, reduces weight and reduces power dissipation and provides a large dynamic range when compared to varactor diode systems.

      One embodiment implements the variable capacitance array on a semiconductor substrate.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, the unique variable capacitance array accounts for the parasitic capacitance existing in many semiconductor devices.
      <br/>
      Parasitic capacitance is extraneous capacitance which occurs in semiconductor devices such as integrated circuits.
      <br/>
      Unlike most discrete components, an integrated circuit comprises a group of densely packed components on multiple layers of material.
      <br/>
      The proximity of the components and the configuration of the layers produce extraneous (i.e., parasitic) capacitances.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Parasitic capacitances can affect the accuracy and stability of a variable capacitor.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the variable capacitance array accounts for the parasitic capacitance with a variety of components and design configurations.
      <br/>
      As a result, when compared to discrete components such as varactor diodes, the integrated circuit embodiment of the variable capacitance array provides high-linearity, low spread, improved response to power supply rejections, while reducing power dissipation, and manufacturing costs.

    <p num="43">
      One embodiment of the present invention is an apparatus and method for varying the capacitance in a variable capacitance array.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the variable capacitance array allows relatively precise adjustments over a wide dynamic range.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In one embodiment, the variable capacitance array has multiple capacitance modules.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, a capacitance module comprises at least one capacitor in combination with a switch.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the capacitance module is a pairing of multiple capacitors.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the capacitance module is a region near at least one capacitor.
      <br/>
      The region includes an area in physical proximity with one or more capacitors and an associated stray or parasitic capacitance.
      <br/>
      The region can include elements such as connection lines, additional capacitors, the plates of the capacitors, switches, non-operational components or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In one embodiment, each capacitance module selectively enables different capacitance values.
      <br/>
      The variable capacitance array adjusts the amount of capacitance by enabling and disabling different capacitive values in the capacitance modules.
      <br/>
      Typically, the amount of capacitance is modified with a switch which enables or disables a capacitance value.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Each capacitance module has a capacitive value and a corresponding parasitic capacitance.
      <br/>
      The ratio of the capacitance value to the parasitic capacitance is called the parasitic ratio.
      <br/>
      The parasitic ratio in each capacitance module can vary.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the parasitic ratios in the different capacitance modules are set to similar values.
      <br/>
      As discussed in further detail below, similar parasitic ratios improve the accuracy and precision of the unique variable capacitor array.

      Indeed, the least significant bit of the variable capacitance array 402 adjusts the value of the fine adjustment array 504 by as little as approximately 1.953 fF. One obstacle in achieving this level of accuracy in integrated circuit devices is what is called component matching.

      In addition to component matching, another obstacle is parasitic capacitance.
      <br/>
      Parasitic capacitance is the extraneous capacitance which occurs in integrated circuit devices.
      <br/>
      Unlike most discrete components, an integrated circuit comprises a group of densely packed components on multiple layers of material.

    <p num="161">
      In addition, parasitic capacitance varies when the structures of the different semiconductor layers vary and also with the signal (voltage dependent junction capacitances).

      By way of example, parasitic capacitance exists between the plates of the capacitors 510a-510g and other layers of material in the semiconductor.
      <br/>
      In addition, parasitic capacitance exists between the connection lines 704 which and other layers of material in the semiconductor.

      For example, the amount of parasitic capacitance is controlled by adding additional connection lines 704 and by adding additional switches 512 in series, parallel or some combination thereof.
