    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to an electronic endoscope having a solid state image pickup device at a front end of an insertion portion thereof.
      <br/>
      The pickup device converts an image viewed through the endoscope into electrical signals which can be sent to an external device to reproduce the image on a monitor, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">It is necessary to carry out a gamma correction of image signals supplied from a solid state image pickup device, provided at a front end of an insertion portion of an endoscope to reproduce a clear and natural image.</p>
    <p num="6">
      To this end, in a known endoscope, an output value which has been subjected to a gamma correction, corresponding to image signals (original signals) to be input to a gamma correction portion is written in advance in a look-up table in a memory.
      <br/>
      The image signals are applied as an address signal for the memory of the look-up table to produce a corresponding gamma-corrected value.
      <br/>
      The corrected signals are then reconverted to analog signals, processed and displayed on a monitor (see for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 1-178235).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      However, the gamma-corrected value written in the look-up table has a greater value corresponding to the magnitude of the input original signals.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the look-up table requires a large memory size for data storage.
      <br/>
      This results in a substandard memory utilization efficiency and necessitates large and expensive circuits, thereby leading to increased manufacturing costs and power consumption.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Moreover, in the gamma correcting portion, when the original signal is amplified to obtain corrected signals, a noise component is superimposed on the original signal.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the S/N (signal-to-noise ratio) of the input original signal shown in FIG. 26, deteriorates particularly in a low brightness (dark) range having a high gain, as shown in FIG. 27.
    </p>
    <p num="9">It is an object of the present invention to provide an electronic endoscope in which a gamma correction of an image signal can be effected without deteriorating the S/N.</p>
    <p num="10">Still further, in a nonlinear operation with reference to the look-up table, data which is not written in the look-up table, such as data 1-4 between the memory addresses 0 and 1, shown in FIG. 35, is produced.</p>
    <p num="11">
      Consequently, there are large amounts of data which are not written in the look-up table in a low brightness range (dark area) in which data varies considerably depending on the address.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a quantization error inherent in the operation of digital data occurs during the gamma correction.
    </p>
    <p num="12">It is a further object of the present invention to provide an electronic endoscope in which a gamma correction of digital image signals can be carried out without deteriorating the S/N or increasing a quantization error.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">It is an object of the present invention to provide an electronic endoscope having an increased memory utilization efficiency, wherein a look-up table for a gamma correction is a small and inexpensive memory.</p>
    <p num="14">To achieve the object mentioned above, according to the present invention, there is provided an electronic endoscope having a solid state image pickup device supplying an image signal, comprising; a look-up table for storing therein only data necessary for gamma correction with respect to the image signal a; gamma correcting device for adding the gamma correcting data to the image signal and outputting a gamma-correcting image signal.</p>
    <p num="15">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an electronic endoscope having a solid state image pickup device supplying an image signal which is converted to a digital signal and is subject to a gamma correction in accordance with gamma correcting data stored in and read from a look-up table, wherein the look-up table stores therein data necessary for the gamma correction of the original signal, and wherein a low-pass filter eliminates a noise component from the original signal input to the look-up table, so that the data for the gamma correction is added to the original signal read from the look-up table to output a gamma-corrected signal.</p>
    <p num="16">According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided an electronic endoscope having a solid state image pickup device supplying an image signal which is converted to a digital signal and subject to a gamma correction in accordance with gamma correcting data stored in and read from a look-up table, wherein the look-up table stores therein data necessary for the gamma correction of the original signal input thereto, and wherein a low-pass filter removes a noise component from the signal supplied from the look-up table, so that the data for the gamma correction, read from the look-up table, is added through the low-pass filter to the original signal to output a gamma-corrected signal.</p>
    <p num="17">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an electronic endoscope having a solid state image pickup device supplying an image signal is converted to a digital signal and subject to a gamma correction in accordance with gamma correcting data stored in and read from a look-up table, wherein the look-up table stores therein data necessary for the gamma correction of the original signal input thereto, and wherein a first low-pass filter removes a noise component from the signal supplied to the look-up table, and a second low-pass filter removes a noise component from the signal issued from to the look-up table, so that the data for the gamma correction, read from the look-up table and transmitted through the second low-pass filter, is added to the original signal to output a gamma-corrected signal.</p>

      In the CCD processor 14, the output signal of the solid state image pickup device 4 is amplified by an amplifier 23 and sent to a sample holding circuit 24 in which image signals are extracted.
      <br/>
      The image signals are sent to an A/D converter 25 where analog image signals are converted to digital signals, which are then subject to a gamma correction in a gamma correcting circuit 26.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The gamma-corrected image signals are rearranged by the timing circuit 15 in synchronization with the driving operation of the solid state image pickup device 4, and are stored in frame memories 28R, 28G and 28B corresponding to red (R), green (G) and blue (B) colors.
      <br/>
      The image signals stored in the frame memories 28R, 28G and 28B are read simultaneously and converted to analog color signals by D/A converters 29R, 29G and 29B, respectively,

      The three color signals are output as three primary color signals and supplied to an NTSC encoder 30 disposed in parallel with the outputs to obtain NTSC type compound video signals to which synchronization signals are added.

      FIGS. 4 and 5 show line graphs of data stored in the memory 32 for the look-up table, by way of example.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 4, the gamma-corrected values supplied to the timing circuit 15 are greater than the original input signal.
      <br/>
      However, the correction data, indicated by the gamma hatched area, is considerably smaller than the gamma-corrected values.

      In the present invention, only the data for gamma correction, as shown in FIG. 5, is stored written in the memory 32 for the look-up table.

      The original signals are applied as an address signal for the look-up table, so that the correction data corresponding to the address signal is read from the memory 32.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the correction data is added to the original signals in the adder 33 to obtain a gamma-corrected value.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Thus, as can be seen in FIG. 1, the gamma correcting data (data for gamma correction) is about one fourth of the full scale data, and accordingly, the memory 32 for the look-up table requires a capacity which is 2 bits smaller than the original signals for storing the gamma correcting data.
      <br/>
      Note that the output signal of the adder 33 is a 10-bit signal which is the same as the original signal.

    <p num="32">
      If a reference voltage is applied to a linear correction terminal of the A/D converter 25 to carry out linear gamma correction, shown in FIG. 6, the data for the gamma correction is further reduced as shown in FIG. 7.

      FIGS. 9 through 17 show a third embodiment of the present invention.

      In the third embodiment, various kinds of gamma correction data are written in one memory and are selectively used.
      <br/>
      The selected gamma correcting data are indicated as discussed below.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The gamma correction data to be written in the memory 32 is for gamma correction as in the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      Although two kinds of gamma correcting data are stored in one memory in the third embodiment, it is possible to store three or more kinds of gamma correcting data in the memory 32.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      FIG. 9 shows the contents of the memory 32 for the look-up table.
      <br/>
      The memory has a larger address bit number than the number of data bits, so that the access number of address bits is used as switching bits.
      <br/>
      For example, first gamma correcting data is stored in the look-up table having addresses 0 to 1023, and second gamma correcting data is stored in the look-up table having addresses 1024 to 2047.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      If the switching bit of the memory 32 is "0", the addresses 0 to 1023 are accessed, and if the switching bit is "1", addresses 1024 to 2047 are accessed.

      FIG. 10 shows a connector 6 of the endoscope, in which the signal "0" or "1" is written in the EEPROM 8 (FIG. 2), in accordance with the characteristics of a particular endoscope to be used.

      If the connector 6 is attached to the video processor 10, the signal "0" or "1" is supplied to the switching bit of the memory 32 in which the first or second gamma correction data is selected in accordance with the input signal, as shown in FIG. 11.

    <p num="39">It is possible to produce the signal "0" or "1", determined in accordance with the voltage set in the endoscope in order to supply the signal "0" or "1" to the memory 32 for the look-up table, depending on the characteristics of the associated endoscope, as shown in FIG. 12.</p>
    <p num="40">Alternatively, it is also possible to produce the signal "0" or "1" by turning on or off a switch 41 within the video processor 10 using a projection or recess formed on the connector 6, as shown in FIG. 13.</p>
    <p num="41">Moreover, it is possible to provide a manual switch 42 on the endoscope 1 or the video processor 10, so that an operator can optionally select the signal "0" or "1" in accordance with the state of a subject to be examined, as shown in FIG. 14.</p>

      FIG. 15 shows a display of a monitor 18 in which the selected gamma correcting data is shown by an indicator 18a at the lower right corner of the display.

      The indication can be effected by inputting the separate signal "0" or "1" which is adapted to select the gamma correcting data, as shown in FIG. 11, into the CPU 17a of the system controller 17 (FIG. 16) which processes the characters of the signal on the OSD (On Screen Display) 17b.
      <br/>
      The processed signals are added to the tricolor image signal and sent to the monitor 18.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, it is possible to indicate the selected gamma correcting data on the operation panel 43 of the video processor 10, etc., as shown in FIG. 17.

    <p num="43">As can be understood from the above discussion, according to the present invention, since only the data for gamma correction with respect to the original signals are written in the look-up table for the gamma correction, the look-up table uses by a small and inexpensive memory, thus resulting in an improved memory utilization efficiency and a small circuit, and reducing manufacturing costs and power consumption.</p>
    <p num="44">
      Consequently, if various types of gamma correcting data are selectively used, they can be stored in a single memory.
      <br/>
      This leads to the realization of a small circuit and a reduced number of components.
      <br/>
      Moreover, indicating the selected gamma correcting data on a display makes it possible to easily adjust the reproduced image and ensures a reliable examination of a subject to be examined.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Another embodiment of the invention in which the gamma correction of the image signals is performed without decreasing the S/N is discussed below with reference to FIGS. 18 through 27.</p>
    <p num="46">In FIG. 18 which shows another embodiment of the gamma correcting circuit 26 shown in FIG. 3, the gamma correcting circuit 26 is comprised of a ROM 32 for the look-up table, a low-pass filter 34 which removes a noise component from the original signal supplied to the memory 32 for the look-up table, and an adder 33 which adds the output signals of the memory 32 and the original signals.</p>
    <p num="47">The data stored in the memory 32 for the look-up table are the same as those shown in FIGS. 4 through 7.</p>
    <p num="48">
      The low-pass filter 34 is connected directly to the image signal input line before the memory 32 for the look-up table, so that the original signals sent to the adder 33 do not pass through the low-pass filter 34.

      Consequently, the image signals with a removed noise component are supplied to the memory 32, but the original signals are supplied to the adder 33.

      In each low-pass filter shown in FIGS. 19, 20 or 21 the digital image signal input thereto is received by a latch 341 and multiplied by a plurality of predetermined constants k0 through k4 in parallel.

      The outputs are sent to the latches 342, and then added in the case of the horizontal filter, sent to line memories 343 and then added in the case of the vertical filter, and are received by memories 344 and added in the case of the time filter, respectively.

    <p num="102">
      FIGS. 39 and 40 show changes of the signal level (FIG. 39) and the wave shape (FIG. 40) in the high brightness area (FIG. 5 B-D), respectively.
      <br/>
      If the signal whose wave shape is identical 1 to is supplied, the noise component is reduced as indicated in 2 when the signal passes through the first low-pass filter 34.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      In the high brightness area (FIG. 5 B-D), when the level of the original signal is increased, the gamma correcting data is reduced.
      <br/>
      Consequently, if the signal whose wave shape is identical to 2 to is supplied to the memory 32 for the look-up table, the gamma correcting data is reduced as indicated by 3, so that an inverted wave shape is obtained.
      <br/>
      If the signal is sent to the second low-pass filter 35, the noise component thereof is further reduced thereby, as indicated by 4.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      When the original signal and the gamma correction signal transmitted through the second low-pass filter 35 are added in the adder 33, the gamma-corrected output signal is obtained.
      <br/>
      Namely, an enhancement effect to emphasize the outline is achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="105">The first and second low-pass filters 34 and 35 respectively, provided before and after the ROM 32 for the look-up table can emphasize the outline of the image signals more clearly than the case where a single low-pass filter is provided before or after the ROM 32, as can be seen in FIG. 43.</p>
    <p num="106">Note that it is possible to provide a delay circuit in the transmission line of the original signal to be supplied to the adder 33 for adjusting the delay time caused by the first and second low-pass filters 34 and 35 respectively, and the ROM 32.</p>
    <p num="107">
      As can be seen from the foregoing, the noise is reduced or eliminated in the low brightness area and the outline is emphasized in the high brightness area.
      <br/>
      If various gamma correcting data are selectively used, the area for the removal of the noise component and the area for the enhancement can be selected as needed.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      The present invention is not limited to the illustrated embodiments.
      <br/>
      For instance, it is possible to connect the gamma correcting circuits 26R, 26G and 26B to the output terminals of the color frame memories 28R, 28G and 28B within the video processor 16 to independently carry out the gamma corrections for the tricolor signals, as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      In this alternative, the structure and the operation of the gamma correcting circuits 26R, 26G and 26B are the same as those in the first embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="109">As can be understood from the above discussion, according to the present invention, since the noise component is reduced or removed from the image signals by the first and second low-pass filters before or after the image signals are supplied to or from the ROM 32 for the look-up table from which gamma correcting data is read, the amplification of the noise component is restricted when the gamma correction of the dark image signal is effected, thereby obtaining a good S/N.</p>
    <p num="110">In the above embodiments the CCD is provided on the front end of the insertion portion of the endoscope but is not limited to this structure and can be provided on outer end of the endoscope.</p>
    <p num="111">Furthermore, since data which is not stored in the look-up table is output as gamma correcting data, an occurrence of a quantization error during the gamma correction of the digital signals of low level are restricted remarkably.</p>
    <p num="112">Moreover, since the original signals do not pass through the low-pass filters, no smoothening of the wave shape of the original signal by the low-pass filters occurs, and thereby, high quality image signals can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="113">Furthermore, the outline of the image signal is emphasized in the bright image area, and accordingly, the gamma correction, the elimination of the noise component and the enhancement can be performed by one circuit.</p>
