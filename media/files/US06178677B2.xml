      A vehicle-mounted, rear-directed message display apparatus includes a housing which includes a transparent rear wall, a front wall, side walls, a bottom wall, and a cover.
      <br/>
      Support assemblies are connected to the side walls and extend downward.
      <br/>
      Illumination lamps are supported inside the housing near the front wall.
      <br/>
      A display sign is supported inside the housing between the illumination lamps and the transparent rear wall.
      <br/>
      The display sign includes an opaque background and transparent message lettering.
      <br/>
      An illumination control switch is electrically connected to the illumination lamps.
      <br/>
      With the invention installed in a front vehicle, when the driver of the front vehicle thinks that a following vehicle is following too closely, the driver of the front vehicle can operate the illumination control switch to light the illumination lamps to illuminate the display sign to warn the driver of the following vehicle that the following vehicle is following too closely.
      <br/>
      The front wall includes an illumination monitor aperture so that a driver can observe the status of the message display in the rear view mirror of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      With another embodiment of the invention, each of the support assemblies further includes a lock nut connected to a respective strut-to-housing connector portion for locking the housing in a selected orientation angle with respect to the respective support assembly.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to vehicle-mounted display signs and, more particularly, to vehicle-mounted display signs that are visible from behind the rear window of a front vehicle to warn a following vehicle against following too closely.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The problem of one vehicle following another vehicle too closely ("tailgating") is well known.
      <br/>
      Throughout the years, a number of innovations have been developed relating to warning drivers of following vehicles that they are following a vehicle in front of them too closely.
      <br/>
      In this respect, the following U.S. patents are representative of some of those innovations: U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,026,498, 4,449,167, and 5,838,228.
      <br/>
      More specifically, U.S. Pat. No. 3,026,498 employs an apparatus in a front vehicle that has an illuminated sign that warns a following vehicle to keep its distance based upon a light sensor in the front vehicle that detects the headlights of a following vehicle.
      <br/>
      Such a device is not useful when the following vehicle is not using headlights, such as during the daytime.
      <br/>
      In this respect, it would be desirable if an illuminated message sign were provided in a front vehicle to warn a following vehicle about following too closely that does not depend upon sensing light from headlights in the following vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,449,167 discloses an illuminated, rear-facing message sign for a vehicle that depends upon pressing a brake pedal for its illumination.
      <br/>
      There are times when the driver of a front car wishes to warn the driver of a following car about following too closely, but the driver of the front car wishes to maintain speed, and does not want to put pressure upon the brake pedal.
      <br/>
      In this respect, it would be desirable if a rear-facing illuminated sign provides warning to a driver in a following car from following too closely without depending upon a brake pedal sensor for activating the illuminated sign.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,838,228 discloses a system for preventing rear end collisions which depends upon electronically sensing a distance between a front vehicle and a following vehicle and calculating a safe following distance factoring in the speed of the vehicles.
      <br/>
      For purposes of simplicity and direct control by a driver of a front vehicle, it would be desirable if the driver of a front vehicle had manual control over the illumination of a rear-facing message sign for warning a driver in a following vehicle that the vehicle is following too closely.

      As a matter of interest, U.S. Pat. No. 4,470,214 discloses a display sign for the rear window of a vehicle.
      <br/>
      The illumination of the sign is controlled by a driver selectively placing a power plug in a cigarette lighter.
      <br/>
      The sign itself is illuminated by a light shining on it from the rear-facing side of the sign.
      <br/>
      Rather than occupy a cigarette lighter, it would be desirable if a manually operated switch were provided for an illuminated sign that is independent of the cigarette lighter.
      <br/>
      In addition, to provide greater visual contrast between the message of a sign and its background, it would be desirable if the message of the sign were back-lighted.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Also, as a matter of interest, U.S. Pat. No. 5,099,594 discloses a vehicle-mounted message display that uses suction cups for mounting the message display on the inside surface of a rear window of a vehicle.
      <br/>
      Rather than mounting a message sign on a glass window, to avoid the stresses to the glass that such a mounting entails, it would be desirable if a message display for a rear window sign were mounted on the horizontal surface located between the back of the rear seat and the rear window.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Still other features would be desirable in a vehicle-mounted, rear-directed message display apparatus.
      <br/>
      For example, when a driver in a front vehicle looks in one's rear view mirror to see if a rear-facing message sign is operating properly, it is difficult to ascertain proper operation.
      <br/>
      In this respect, it would be desirable if a rear-facing sign had a forward-facing aperture that emitted light when the rear-facing sign is illuminated.
      <br/>
      In this way, a driver looking in the rear view mirror can see a forward shining light as evidence that the rear-facing sign is working properly.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Different drivers may have different preferences for specific wordings in rear-facing signs.
      <br/>
      In this respect, it would be desirable if a rear-facing sign had a variety of interchangeable messages that would appeal to a variety of drivers.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Thus, while the foregoing body of prior art indicates it to be well known to use rear-facing message signs in vehicles, the prior art described above does not teach or suggest a vehicle-mounted, rear-directed message display apparatus which has the following combination of desirable features: (1) provides an illuminated message sign in a front vehicle to warn a following vehicle about following too closely that does not depend upon sensing light from headlights in the following vehicle; (2) provides a rear-facing illuminated sign to warn a driver in a following car from following too closely without depending upon a brake pedal sensor for activating the illuminated sign; (3) enables the driver of a front vehicle to have manual control over the illumination of a rear-facing message sign for warning a driver in a following vehicle that the vehicle is following too closely; (4) provides a manually operated switch for an illuminated sign that is independent of the cigarette lighter of the vehicle; (5) provides back-lighting for the message of the sign; (6) provides a rear window sign that is mounted on the horizontal surface located between the back of the rear seat and the rear window of a vehicle; (7) provides a rear-facing sign has with a forward-facing aperture that emits light when the rear-facing sign is illuminated; and (8) provides a rear-facing sign has a variety of interchangeable messages that would appeal to a variety of drivers.

      <br/>
      An illumination assembly is supported inside the housing 14.
      <br/>
      A display sign 30 is supported inside the housing 14 between the illumination assembly and the transparent rear wall 16.
      <br/>
      An illumination control switch 21 is electrically connected to the illumination assembly by an electrical conductor 27.
      <br/>
      With the invention installed in a front vehicle, when the driver of the front vehicle thinks that a following vehicle is following too closely, the driver of the front vehicle can operate the illumination control switch 21 to light the illumination assembly to warn the driver of the following vehicle that the following vehicle is following too closely.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The display sign 30 includes an opaque background and transparent message lettering.
      <br/>
      Each of the side walls 18 includes a sign-reception groove 41.
      <br/>
      The bottom wall 19 also includes a sign-reception groove 41.
      <br/>
      The front wall 17 includes an illumination monitor aperture 28.
      <br/>
      A hinge 26 is connected between the cover 20 and the front wall 17.
      <br/>
      A cover latch 24 is connected to the cover 20, and a latch locking member 22 is connected to each one of the side walls 18 for engaging a respective cover latch 24 when the cover 20 is closed.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The support assemblies are connected to the side walls 18 of the housing 14.
      <br/>
      Each of the support assemblies includes a support base plate 44 and base-plate-to-vehicle fasteners 46 for attaching the support base plate 44 to a horizontal surface 12 located between the back of a rear seat and rear window of a vehicle.
      <br/>
      An internally threaded cylindrical riser member 42 is connected to the support base plate 44.
      <br/>
      An externally threaded strut 40 is adjustably connected to the cylindrical riser member 42 by interengagement of the internal and external threads.
      <br/>
      A strut-to-housing connector portion 38 is connected to the strut 40.
      <br/>
      A connector-portion-reception bracket 34 is provided.
      <br/>
      An offset bushing 32 is located between the connector-portion-reception bracket 34 and one of the side walls 18, and fasteners 36 are provided for connecting the connector-portion-reception bracket 34 and the offset bushing 32 to the side wall 18.
    </p>
    <p num="38">As shown in FIG. 6 with another embodiment of the invention, wherein each of the support assemblies further includes a lock nut 37 is connected to a respective strut-to-housing connector portion 38 for locking the respective housing 14 in a selected orientation angle with respect to the respective support assembly.</p>
    <p num="39">
      To install the message display apparatus 10 of the invention in a vehicle, the support base plates 44 are mounted on the horizontal surface 12 located between the back of the rear seat and the rear window using base-plate-to-vehicle fasteners 46, such as screws.
      <br/>
      The height of the housing 14 with respect to the support base plate 44 is determined by the cumulative length of the amount of the strut 40 extending out from the cylindrical riser member 42 and the length of the cylindrical riser member 42.
      <br/>
      For higher installations, the strut 40 is unscrewed from the cylindrical riser member 42 to increase the cumulative length.
      <br/>
      For lower installations, the strut 40 is screwed into the cylindrical riser member 42 to decrease the cumulative length.
      <br/>
      Once the desired installation height is adjusted, the strut-to-housing connector portion 38 is slipped between the connector-portion-reception bracket 34 and the offset bushing 32, and the fasteners 36 are tightened to secure the strut-to-housing connector portion 38 to the housing 14.
      <br/>
      The height of the installation is determined by a number of factors such as the height of the rear window of the vehicle, the height of the driver, and the height of the housing 14.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      There can be a variety of different display signs 30, and each can display a different message.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 1, the message can read "PLEASE STAY BACK".
      <br/>
      Other display signs 30 with other messages can read "YOU'RE TOO CLOSE", "PLEASE GET BACK", "PLEASE FALL BACK", "PLEASE BACK OFF", and "DON'T TAILGATE", among others.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      To install a selected display sign 30 in the housing 14, the cover latches 24 are lifted off of the latch locking members 22, and the cover 20 is swung upward around the hinge 26.
      <br/>
      A selected display sign 30 in slipped into the sign-reception grooves 41 in the side walls 18 and the bottom wall 19.
      <br/>
      Then, the cover 20 is closed, and the cover latches 24 locked onto the latch locking members 22.
      <br/>
      To change the display sign 30, the cover latch 24 are unlocked, the cover 20 is opened, one display sign 30 is slipped out from the sign-reception grooves 41.
      <br/>
      A new display sign 30 is slipped into the sign-reception grooves 41, and the cover 20 is closed and locked.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      For each of the embodiments of the invention shown in the drawings, the illumination assembly includes electrical circuitry shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the illumination assembly includes lamps 25 and electrical conductors 27 connected between the lamps 25 located inside the housing 14.
      <br/>
      The illumination control switch 21 is connected to the lamps 25 by an electrical conductor 27.
      <br/>
      A battery 23 for the vehicle is employed as the source of electrical power, and an electrical conductor 27 is connected between the illumination control switch 21 and the battery 23.
      <br/>
      An electrical conductor 27 is connected between the battery 23 and the lamps 25.
      <br/>
      The illumination control switch 21 can be mounted on the dashboard of the vehicle giving easy access to the driver.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      To operate the message display apparatus 10, a driver of the vehicle manually operates the illumination control switch 21.
      <br/>
      When the illumination assembly is lit, the driver can observe this status by looking in the rear view mirror and seeing illumination through the illumination monitor aperture 28 in the front wall 17 of the housing 14.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In the illumination assembly, the lamps 25 are located forward of the display sign 30.
      <br/>
      The display sign 30 has an opaque background and transparent letter for the respective message.
      <br/>
      As a result, when the lamps 25 are lit, the message is backlit for an observer at the rear of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      A conventional flasher 47 is installed in the electrical circuit between the on-off switch and the lamps 25 so the lamps 25 will flash on and off when energized, thereby enhancing visibility of the warning message.
      <br/>
      When the on-off switch is turned on, the warning message flashes on and off like a turn signal, and continues to do so until the control switch is turned off.
      <br/>
      The driver of the trailing vehicle is much more likely to observe, heed, be impressed by, and comply with a warning message that is flashing on and off, vis-a-vis one that is not.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      With reference to the embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 6, when installing the message display apparatus 10 on the horizontal surface 12 located between the back of the rear seat and the rear window, it may be desirable to tilt the housing 14 with respect to the support base plates 44 at a desired orientation angle.
      <br/>
      When such is the case, the lock nuts 37 on each support assembly are loosened, the angle of the housing 14 with respect to the support base plates 44 is adjusted to the desired orientation angle, and the lock nuts 37 are retightened to secure the housing 14 at the desired orientation angle.
    </p>
    <p num="47">The components of the vehicle-mounted, rear-directed message display apparatus of the invention can be made from inexpensive and durable metal and plastic materials.</p>
    <p num="48">As to the manner of usage and operation of the instant invention, the same is apparent from the above disclosure, and accordingly, no further discussion relative to the manner of usage and operation need be provided.</p>
    <p num="49">
