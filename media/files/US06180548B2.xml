      An environment-purifying material is obtained by immersing a carrier with a titanium oxide film coated on its surface or a substrate comprising titanium oxide particles, in a pseudo-body fluid containing an excessive amount of calcium phosphate, and then coating the surface of the substrate with a porous calcium phosphate film that easily adsorbs toxic substances and that is inactive as a photocatalyst.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to an environment purifying material and its manufacturing method wherein the material is used to remove offensive odors, to decompose and remove toxic substances or dust in the air, to provide wastewater treatment or water-purifying treatment, or to perform sterilization or algae elimination, or is added to organic fibers or plastics by means of mixing.</p>
    <heading>PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In recent years, offensive odors in residential or working spaces and contamination caused by toxic substances such as exhaust gas from vehicles have become an incresingly serious problem.
      <br/>
      Water contamination caused by gray water or industrial wastewater, particularly, the contamination of water sources by organic-chlorine solvents or agricultural chemicals in golf fields is difficult to treat using the current water treatment method under the Activated Sludge Process.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      A common conventional method for preventing offensive odors or removing toxic substances in the air is to allow such odors or substances to be absorbed or adsorbed by an acid or alkali absorbent or adsorbent.
      <br/>
      This method, however, is disadvantageous in the disposal of wastewater or the used adsorbent, and may involve secondary pollution.
      <br/>
      An aromatic can also be used to conceal the offensive odor, but the odor of the aromatic may soak into and spoil foods (for further information, refer to "Encyclopedia", Heibonsha, Vol. 1, p. 136, K. Nishida, 1984).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      When titanium oxide is irradiated with light, electrons having a strong reduction effect and holes having a strong oxidation effect are generated to decompose molecular species that come into contact with them.
      <br/>
      This effect of titanium oxide, i.e., its photocatalyst effect, can be used to decompose and remove environmental-pollution materials such as organic solvents, agricultural chemicals, and surface-active agents that are dissolved in water as well as toxic substances or offensive odors in the air.
      <br/>
      This method can be repeated simply by using titanium oxide and light, and its reactive products are nontoxic carbon dioxide.
      <br/>
      Unlike biological treatments using microorganisms, it is not limited by reaction conditions such as temperature, pH, gas atmosphere, and toxicity, and is advantageous in its ability to decompose and remove organic halides or phosphides that cannot be treated easily using said biological treatments.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Conventional studies of the decomposition and removal of organisms using a titanium oxide photocatalyst used titanium oxide powder as a photocatalyst (for additional information, refer to the following: A. L. Pruden and D. F. Ollis, Journal of Catalysis, Vol. 82, 404 (1983), H. Hidaka, H. Jou, K. Nohara, and J. Zhao, Chemosphere, Vol. 25, 1589 (1992). and T. Hisanaga, K. Herada, and K. Tanaka, Industrial Water, Vol. 379, 12 (1990)).</p>
    <p num="6">
      Thus, this method is difficult to use for a variety of reasons, including the diffculty of collecting used catalysts.
      <br/>
      Attempts were therefore made to mix the titanium oxide photocatalyst into a medium such as fibers or plastics that are easy to handle.
      <br/>
      Due to its strong photocatalyst effect, however, the titanium oxide photocatalyst not only decompose toxic organisms or environmental-pollution materials but also decompose and significantly degrade the fibers or plastics, rendering mixture into the fibers or plastics extremely difficult.
      <br/>
      In addition, if the titanium oxide photocatalyst is used as an antibacterial or a antifungal material, bacteria do not adhere to the photocatalyst appropriately due to flowing water, thereby reducing the effects and efficiency of the treatment.
    </p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      In view of the above problems, it is an object of this invention to provide an environment-purifying material and its manufacturing method wherein the material can be used to effectively and economically purify environments by removing offensive odors, decomposing and removing toxic substances or dust from the air, providing wastewater or water-purifying treatment, or enabling protection from bacteria or fungi.
      <br/>
      Even if this material is added to organic fibers or plastics by means of mixing, it does not degrade the medium but can maintain its durability.
    </p>
    <p num="8">As a result of their efforts in achieving this object, the inventors have found that by coating a calcium phosphate film around titanium oxide when the latter is added to a medium, the durability of the titanium oxide can be improved without negatively affecting its photocatalyst function due to the inactivity of the calcium phosphate film as a photocatalyst, its ability to adsorb various bacteria, and its porosity.</p>
    <p num="9">This invention provides an environment-purifying material composed of a porous calcium phosphate coated on a surface of a substrate, with the surface consisting of titanium oxide.</p>
    <p num="10">
      According to the environment-purifying material of this invention, the calcium phosphate film covering the surface is porous, so the titanium oxide is exposed from the bottoms of pores, where it is irradiated with light.
      <br/>
      The oxidation-reduction effect of electrons and holes generated during irradiation with light serves to decompose and remove offensive odors, or organic compounds contaminating environments, including toxic substances in the air and organic solvents or agricultural chemicals dissolved in water.
    </p>
    <p num="11">In addition, due to its inactivity as a photocatalyst, even if the environment-purifying material is added to a medium such as organic fibers or plastics by means of mixing, it is protected by the calcium phosphate film, preventing the fibers or plastics from being decomposed in order to ensure its effects last over a longer period of time.</p>
    <p num="12">Furthermore, due to the calcium phosphate film's ability to adsorb various bacteria, various adsorbed bacteria can be reliably and efficiently killed and decomposed by the powerful oxidation effect of the titanium oxide provided when irradiated with light.</p>
    <p num="13">
      In addition, to obtain this environment-purifying material, this invention provides a environment-purifying material manufacturing method characterized in that a substrate having a surface consisting of titanium oxide is immersed in a pseudo-body fluid containing an excessive amount of calcium phosphate compared with real human body fluid in order to coat a porous calcium phosphate film on the surface of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The concentration of calcium phosphate in the pseudo-body fluid is preferably about 1 to 20 times, or more preferably, 2 to 15 times greater than that in the human body fluid.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A carrier used for this invention includes activated carbon, activated alumina, silica gel, zeolite, clay sintered compacts, glass, foam ceramics, foam metal, and foam plastics, but silica gel or glass are the most preferable materials in terms of light transmissivity.
      <br/>
      In addition, the carrier preferably contains silicon or titanium.
    </p>
    <p num="15">The carrier used for this invention may have an arbitrary shape, and may be shaped like, for example, particles, a plate, a cylinder, a prism, a cone, a sphere, a gourd, or a rugby ball.</p>
    <p num="16">The titanium oxide film can be coated on the surface of the carrier using various methods, including evaporation, PVD, CVD, sputtering, coating of titanium oxide sol using the sol-gel process, and fixation of titanium oxide in very fine particles.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The titanium oxide particles and film used for this invention preferably have an anatase crystal form because it provides high performance as a photocatalyst.
      <br/>
      The rutile, brookite, or amorphous types are not very preferable due to their low level of photocatalyst activity.
      <br/>
      In addition, the titanium oxide particles may be of any size, but are preferably of submicron-scale size when mixed into organic fibers or plastics.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The environment-purifying material according to this invention is prepared by immersing in a pseudo body fluid a substrate the surface of which is coated with titanium oxide to generate porous calcium phosphate on the surface.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The pseudo body fluid used for this invention is prepared by dissolving in water NaCl, NaHCO3, KCl, K2 HPO4.3H2 O, MgCl2.6H2 O, CaCl2, and Na2 SO4 or NaF.
      <br/>
      And pH is preferably adjusted to between 7 and 8, more preferably, 7.4 using HCL or (CH2 OH)3 CNH2.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The preferable composition of the pseudo body fluid used for this invention is shown below.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Na+ 120 to 160 mM
      <br/>
      K+ 1 to 20 mM
      <br/>
      Ca2+ 0.5 to 50 mM
      <br/>
      Mg2+ 0.5 to 50 mM
      <br/>
      Cl- 80 to 200 mM
      <br/>
      HCO3- 0.5 to 30 mM
      <br/>
      HPO42- 1 to 20 mM
      <br/>
      SO42- 0.1 to 20 mM
      <br/>
      F- 0 to 5 mM
    </p>
    <p num="22">If the concentration is higher, creation of calcium phosphate becomes more time consuming, whereas when it is lower, calcium phosphate is rapidly created to hinder porosity or thickness control.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The temperature of the pseudo-body fluid is preferably between 30 (degree)  C. and 10 (degree)  C. when the substrate is immersed in the fluid.
      <br/>
      When the temperature is lower, a greater amount of time is required to generate calcium phosphate, whereas when it is higher, control over the film thickness and porosity is hindered due to the evaporation of the pseudo body fluid.
      <br/>
      The temperature is most preferably between 50 (degree)  C. and 80 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The time during which the substrate is immersed in the pseudo-body fluid is preferably between one hour and 18 days.
      <br/>
      When the time is shorter, calcium phosphate is insufficiently generated, whereas when the time is longer, the film thickness becomes excessive.
    </p>
    <p num="25">In addition, according to the environment-purifying material of this invention, when metal such as platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, palladium, silver, copper, or zinc supports the surface of the titanium oxide film, the speed at which chemical substances are oxidized and decomposed increases to improve the sterilization and algae-elimination effects.</p>
    <p num="26">
      According to the environment-purifying material of this invention, the porosity, thickness, and shape of the calcium phostate on its surface can be controlled by varying the composition of the pseudo body fluid, the temperature, or the immersion time.
      <br/>
      When the content of phosphorous or calcium, the temperature, or the time is reduced, a striped or thin calcium phosphate film is generated on the surface of the substrate.
      <br/>
      If the content of phosphorous or calcium, or the temperature is increased, the film thickness of calcium phosphate increases.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The surface of the environment-purifying material obtained in this manner is coated with calcium phostate, which is inactive as a photocatalyst, and since apatite hydroxide adsorbs protein, amino acid, bacteria, and viruses, the apatite film on the surface can adsorb bacteria in water or the air.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the calcium phosphate film has pores on its surface and titanium oxide, which is active as a photocatalyst, is exposed from the bottom of the pores, these exposed portions are irradiated with sunlight or artificial light from fluorescent lights, incandescent lamps, black lights, UV lamps, mercury lamps, xenon lamps, halogen lamps, or metal halide lamps.
      <br/>
      Due to the oxidization-reduction effect of electrons and holes generated in titanium oxide during irradiation with light, the protein, amino acid, bacteria, and viruses adsorbed by the apatite film can be continuously decomposed and removed promptly.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      If the environment-purifying material is mixed into a medium such as organic fibers or plastics, the portion contacting the organic fibers or plastics and consisting of ceramics that are inactive as a photocatalyst adsorbs offensive odors or toxic substances such as NOx in the air, or organic compounds that contaminate environments, including organic solvents or agricultural chemicals that are dissolved in water without causing said organic fibers or plastics to decompose.
      <br/>
      These substances are then continuously decomposed and removed promptly using the oxidization-reduction effect of electrons and holes generated in titanium oxide during irradiation with sunlight or artificial light from fluorescent lights, incandescent lamps, black lights, UV lamps, mercury lamps, xenon lamps, halogen lamps, or metal halide lamps.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In addition, the present material can be used with light irradiation alone, without the need for high costs or energy or maintenance.
      <br/>
      If metal such as platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, palladium, silver, copper, or zinc supports the surface of the material as titanium oxide particles, its catalyst effect further increases environment-purifying effects such as an organic-compound decomposition and removal effect or an antibacterial or funginert effect.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The environment-purifying material according to this invention is applicable to all types of organic fibers or plastics, as well as their copolymers, including polyethylene, nylon, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyester, polypropylene, polyehtylene oxide, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene terephthalate, silicon resin, polyvinyl alcohol, vinyl acetal resin, polyacetate, ABS resin, epoxy resin, vinyl acetate resin, cellulose, cellulose derivative, polyamide, polyurethane, polycarbonate, polystyrene, urea resin, fluorine-contained resin, polyvinylidene, phenol resin, celluloid, chitin, and starch sheet.</p>
    <p num="31">Embodiments</p>
    <p num="32">Particularly representative embodiments of this invention are shown below.</p>
    <p num="33">�Embodiment 1�</p>
    <p num="34">Water and nitric acid were added to titanium tetraisopropoxide to prepare a transparent titanium oxide sol, and the dip coating method was used to coat the sol on granular alumina approximately 1 cm in diameter that was used as a carrier, followed by firing at 550 (degree)  C. The coating and firing steps were repeated three times to obtain a substrate with its surface coated with a titanium oxide film.</p>
    <p num="35">
      On the other hand, as a pseudo body fluid, an aqueous solution of pH 7.4 composed of 147 mM of Na+, 5 mM of K+, 2.5 mM of Ca2+, 1.5 mM of Mg2+, 147 mM of Cl-, 4.2 mM of HCO3-, 1.0 mM of HPO42-, and 0.5 mM of SO42- was prepared using NaCl, NaHCO3, KCl, K2 HPO4.3H2 O, MgCl2.6H2 O, CaCl2, Na2 SO4, HCl, (CH2 OH)3 CNH2, and distilled water.
      <br/>
      The substrate was placed in this aqueous solution and left at 50 (degree)  C. for 14 days to form the environment--purifying material.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The environment-purifying material obtained was then observed under an analytical electron microscope, and it was determined that the surface of the material was covered with porous apatite hydroxide. 20 environment-purifying materials were placed in a vase with water and left under a fluorescent lamp for two months.
      <br/>
      The surface of the materials did not become slippery and no bacteria or algae were found thereon.

      According to the environment-purifying material of this invention, the calcium phosphate film covering the surface of the substrate is porous so that the titanium oxide on the surface is irradiated with light through the pores, so nearly the same photocatalyst effect can be obtained as in materials that are not covered with the calcium phosphate film.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the calcium phosphate film adsorbs contaminants such as bacteria, the adsorbed contaminants can be reliably and effectively decomposed and removed using the photocatalyst effect.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      Accordingly, the present material is extremely effective in purifying environments, e.g., decomposing and removing offensive odors or toxic substances such as cigarette smoke, NOx, or Sox in the air, decomposing and removing organic compounds such as organic solvents or agricultural chemicals that are dissolved in water, treating or purifying wastewater, preventing stains, eliminating bacteria and fungus, or preventing nosocomial infection such as MRSA.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, titanium oxide is used in paints, cosmetics, or tooth powder and is an authorized food additive.
      <br/>
      Thus, this substance is non-toxic, safe, inexpensive, weather-resistant, and durable, qualities that combine to make the substance extremely economical and practical.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      In addition, the calcium phosphate film is inactive as a photocatalyst, so even if the purifying material were added to a medium such as organic fibers or plastics by means of mixing, it does not degrade the medium but can retain its purifying effect.
      <br/>
      Thus, when added to the medium such as organic fibers or plastics, the environment-purifying material according to this invention can be used for various applications such as the deodorization of a car room, a living room, a kitchen, or a toilet; wastewater treatment, the purification of a pool or stored water; the prevention of the multiplication of bacteria or fungus, or the prevention of the putrefaction of foods.
      <br/>
      In addition, this invention does not require toxic substances such as chemicals or ozone but can be inexpensively and safely used over extended periods of time without the need for high energy or maintenance, as it simply requires irradiation with electric or natural light.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      Furthermore, the environment-purifying material according to this invention can be manufactured simply by placing a substrate in a pseudo-body fluid and leaving the substrate as it is.
      <br/>
      It also enables the diameter of the pores in its surface and their distribution density to be controlled by varying the composition or temperature of the pseudo-body fluid or the relevant times.
