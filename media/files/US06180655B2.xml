    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      It is already known that certain sulphonylbenzazolones have fungicidal properties (cf. DE-A 2 101 150).
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, N,N-dimethyl-7-nitro-2-oxo-5-trifluoro-methyl-benzothiazole-3-sulphonamide can be used for controlling fungi.
      <br/>
      The activity of this compound is good, but at times leaves something to be desired at low application rates.

      Q represents oxygen or sulphur.

    <p num="84">
      These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents, liquefied gases under pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers.

      Liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers are to be understood as meaning liquids which are gaseous at standard temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellants such as halogenated hydrocarbons, or else butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
      <br/>
      Suitable solid carriers are: for example ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates.
      <br/>

    <p num="95">It is also possible to admix other known active compounds, such as herbicides, fertilizers and growth-promoting substances.</p>
    <p num="96">
      The active compounds can be used as such or in the form of their commercial formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, wettable powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules.
      <br/>
      They are used in the customary manner, for example by pouring, spraying, atomizing, spreading, foaming, brushing on and the like.
      <br/>
      It is further possible to apply the active compounds by the ultra-low volume method or to inject the active compound formulation, or the active compound itself, into the soil.
