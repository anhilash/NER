    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to dyes, to inks, to compositions and to their use in ink jet printing ("IJP").
      <br/>
      IJP is a non-impact printing technique in which droplets of ink are ejected through a fine nozzle onto a substrate without bringing the nozzle into contact with the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      There are many demanding performance requirements for dyes and inks used in IJP.
      <br/>
      For example they desirably provide sharp, non-feathered images having good water-fastness, light-fastness and optical density.
      <br/>
      The inks are often required to dry quickly when applied to a substrate to prevent smudging, but they should not form a crust over the tip of an ink jet nozzle because this will stop the printer from working.
      <br/>
      The inks should also be stable to storage over time without decomposing or forming a precipitate which could block the fine nozzle.

      Preferred water-immiscible solvents include, for example, aliphatic hydrocarbons; esters, preferably ethyl acetate; chlorinated hydrocarbons, preferably CH2 Cl2 ; and ethers, preferably diethyl ether; and mixtures thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      When the liquid medium comprises a water-immiscible organic solvent, preferably a polar solvent is included because this enhances solubility of the component (a) of the composition in the liquid medium.
      <br/>
      Examples of polar solvents include C1-4 -alcohols.
      <br/>
      In view of the foregoing preferences it is especially preferred that where the liquid medium is an organic solvent free from water it comprises a ketone (especially methyl ethyl ketone) &amp;/or an alcohol (especially a C1-4 -alkanol, such as ethanol or propanol).
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The organic solvent free from water may be a single organic solvent or a mixture of two or more organic solvents.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that when the medium is an organic solvent free from water it is a mixture of 2 to 5 different organic solvents.
      <br/>
      This allows a medium to be selected which gives good control over the drying characteristics and storage stability.
      <br/>
      This is particularly so when the liquid composition is used as an ink, especially an ink jet printing ink.
    </p>
    <p num="72">Ink media comprising an organic solvent free from water are particularly useful where fast drying times are required and particularly when printing onto hydrophobic and non-absorbent substrates, for example plastics, metal and glass.</p>
    <p num="73">
      Preferred low melting solid media have a melting point in the range from 60 (degree)  C. to 125 (degree)  C. Suitable low melting point solids include long chain fatty acids or alcohols, preferably those with C18-24 chains, and sulphonamides.
      <br/>
      The compound of Formula (1) or Formula (3) may be dissolved in the low melting point solid or may be finely dispersed in it.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The compounds according to the present invention exhibit a high solubility in aqueous media, accordingly it is preferred that the liquid medium is a mixture of water and one or more water miscible organic solvent(s).
      <br/>
      An especially preferred liquid composition which is suitable for use as an ink for an ink jet printer comprises:
      <br/>
      (a) from 1 to 10 parts in total of a compound or composition according to the first or second aspect of the invention;
      <br/>
      (b) from 2 to 60, more preferably 5 to 40 parts of water-soluble organic solvent; and
      <br/>
      (c) from 30 to 97, more preferably 40 to 85 parts water;
    </p>
    <p num="75">wherein all parts are by weight and the sum of the parts (a)+(b)+(c)=100.</p>
    <p num="76">The liquid compositions according to this third aspect of the invention may also contain additional components conventionally used in ink jet printing inks, for example viscosity and surface tension modifiers, corrosion inhibitors, biocides, kogation reducing additives, anti-cockle agents to reduce paper curling and surfactants which may be ionic or non-ionic.</p>
    <p num="77">The pH of the liquid composition is preferably from 4 to 10.</p>
    <p num="78">
      The compounds, compositions and liquid compositions according to the first and second aspects of the present invention may be, and preferably are, purified to remove undesirable impurities before they are incorporated into inks for ink jet printing.
      <br/>
      Conventional purification techniques may be employed, for example ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, dialysis or a combination thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The liquid composition according to the third aspect of the invention preferably have a concentration of less than 100 parts per million, more preferably less than 50 parts per million, in total of undesirable ions, for example halide ions, silicon ions, peroxide radicals and divalent and trivalent metals, especially calcium ions.
      <br/>
      Such liquid compositions are particularly well suited to use as ink jet printing inks because higher levels of undesirable ions could lead to printing problems, especially in thermal ink jet printing heads.
    </p>
    <p num="80">A fourth aspect of the present invention provides a process for printing an image on a substrate comprising applying thereto by means of an ink jet printer an ink containing a compound according to the first aspect of the invention or a composition according to the second aspect of the invention.</p>
    <p num="81">The ink used in this process is preferably a liquid composition according to the third aspect of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="82">
      The ink jet printer preferably applies the ink to the substrate in the form of droplets which are ejected through a small orifice onto the substrate.
      <br/>
      Preferred ink jet printers are piezoelectric ink jet printers and thermal ink jet printers.
      <br/>
      In thermal ink jet printers, programmed pulses of heat are applied to the ink in a reservoir by means of a resistor adjacent to the orifice, thereby causing the ink to be ejected in the form of small droplets directed towards the substrate during relative movement between the substrate and the orifice.
      <br/>
      In piezoelectric ink jet printers the oscillation of a small crystal causes ejection of the ink from the orifice.
    </p>
    <p num="83">The substrate is preferably paper, plastic, a textile, metal or glass, more preferably paper, an overhead projector slide or a textile material, especially paper.</p>
    <p num="84">
      Preferred papers are plain or treated papers which may have an acid, alkaline or neutral character.
      <br/>
      Examples of commercially available papers include, HP Premium Coated Paper, HP Photopaper (all available from Hewlett Packard Inc), Stylus Pro 720 dpi Coated Paper, Epson Photo Quality Glossy Film, Epson Photo Quality Glossy Paper (available from Seiko Epson Corp.), Canon HR 101 High Resolution Paper, Canon GP Glossy Paper, Canon HG 101 High Gloss Film (all available from Canon Inc.), Wiggins Conqueror paper (available from Wiggins Teape Ltd), Xerox Acid Paper and Xerox Alkaline paper, Xerox Acid Paper (available from Xerox).
    </p>
    <p num="85">A fifth aspect of the present invention provides a substrate, preferably a paper, an overhead projector slide or a textile material, printed with a liquid composition according to the third aspect of the present invention or by means of the process according to the fourth aspect of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="86">
      According to a sixth aspect of the present invention there is provided an ink jet printer cartridge comprising a chamber and ink, wherein the ink is present in the chamber and the ink contains a compound or a composition according to the first or second aspect of the invention.
      <br/>

      The ink was loaded into an Seiko Epson Stylus Colour Pro ink jet printer and was ink jet printed onto each of the substrates shown in column 1 of Table 1.
      <br/>
      The resulting prints were a bright magenta shade with a high water-fastness.
      <br/>
      The prints exhibited the reflected optical density shown under "ROD" in Table 1, as measured using an X-Rite (tm)  938 Spectrodensitometer.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      The light-fastness of each print was assessed by exposing a portion of each print to 50 hours fading in an Atlas Ci-35a Weatherometer and measuring the colour difference ( DELTA E) between the faded and un-faded portions of the print using an X-Rite (tm)  Spectrodensitometer.
      <br/>
      The measured  DELTA E values are shown in column 3 of Table 1.
      <br/>
      A small  DELTA E value corresponds to a small colour difference and hence a high light-fastness.
