    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
    <p num="1">This application is prepared under 35 U.S.C. Section 371 of International Patent Application PCT/JP97/04856, filed Dec. 25, 1997.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to novel N-hydroxyurea derivative and pharmaceutical composition containing the same.
      <br/>
      These compounds have a lipoxygenase inhibitory activity and a thromboxane synthase inhibitory activity, so are useful in treating or alleviating allergic diseases or inflammatory diseases.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      In recent years, the role of chemical mediators in asthma and other allergic diseases has been quickly elucidated.
      <br/>
      In addition to histamine, PAF, leukotrienes, thromboxane A2, etc. have become known.
      <br/>
      It has been shown that leukotrienes are biosynthesized by the action of 5-ipoxygenase from arachidonic acid, and thromboxane A2 is biosynthesized by thromboxane synthase after the catabolism with cyclooxygenase from arachidonic acid.
      <br/>
      Further, leukotrienes and thromboxane A2 have both been found to be important chemical mediators in allergic reactions causing various diseases such as asthma, psoriasis, enteritis, nephritis, ulcers, and ischemia.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if it were possible to inhibit the biosynthesis of both chemical mediators, a greater effect could be obtained in treating or alleviating the above diseases when compared with the inhibition of single mediator.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Recently, as compounds for inhibiting the biosynthesis of such two mediators, benzothiazole derivatives (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-178855), quinone derivatives (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-78321), imidazolylphenol derivatives (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 6-9571), and N-hydroxyurea derivatives (WO96/23772) have become known.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">The object of the present invention is to provide compounds capable of inhibiting both the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and thromboxane A2, that is, novel compounds having both the dual inhibition against lipoxygenase and thromboxane synthase at the same time.</p>

      The N-hydroxyurea derivatives provided by the present invention may be produced by many methods.
      <br/>
      The usable starting substances are commercially available compounds or compounds produced from known compounds by known methods.
    </p>
    <p num="37">That is, the compound according to the present invention represented by the formula (I) may be synthesized, for example, by the following reaction process (1) and further may be synthesized by methods other than this reaction process.  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="38">wherein, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, and B are the same as those defined in the formula (I).</p>

      The reactions used in this synthetic process are known, standard methods.
      <br/>
      That is, hydroxyamine (vi) and trimethylsilyl isocyanate are reacted to obtain the target compound (vii).
      <br/>
      Further, in the compounds represented by the formula (I), for example, a compound where R6 is a methyl group, cyclohexyl group, etc. may be synthesized by the reaction of the hydroxylamine and the corresponding R6 --NCO (e.g., methyl isocyanate, cyclohexyl isocyanate).

      For example, it is possible to react a corresponding alcohol (i) using a condition of Mitsunobu reaction with N,O-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)hydroxylamine to synthesize an N,O-protected hydroxylamine (vi), followed by an acid hydrolysis to give the hydroxylamine (vi) (see WO92/01682).
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      As the other method, hydroxylamine (vi) may be synthesized by a reaction between a carbonyl compound (ii), that is, a ketone or aldehyde etc., and hydroxylamine hydrochloride to synthesize an oxime (iii), followed by reducing with a suitable reducing agent (see Journal of American Chemical Society, 1971, vol. 93, p. 2897).

    <p num="43">
      Further, as the other method, hydroxylamine (vi) is easily synthesized from a reaction intermediate, halogen compound (iv) using a known standard method.
      <br/>
      For example, a corresponding halogen compound is reacted in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone with a 50% aqueous hydroxylamine solution to obtain hydroxylamine (vi) (see WO97/10,206).
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Further, the synthetic intermediate aldehyde, ketone, or other carbonyl compound (ii) is synthesized by a standard method.
      <br/>
      For example, it is synthesized by oxidation of alcohol (i).
      <br/>
      The oxidation reaction used may be manganese dioxide oxidation, Jones' oxidation, Swern oxidation, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      On the other hand, the synthetic intermediate alcohol (i) is also synthesized by a standard method.
      <br/>
      For example, a carbonyl compound (ii), such as an aldehyde, ketone and ester, is reduced by various reductant.
      <br/>
      As the reductant used here, sodium borohydride, lithium aluminum hydride, diisobutylaluminum hydride, etc. may be mentioned.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Further, the alcohol (i) may be synthesized, as another method, by using for a Grignard reagent or organometallic compound etc. from the carbonyl compound.
      <br/>
      As a preferable reaction reagent, methylmagnesium bromide may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      Further, the reaction is performed in a range of from -78 (degree)  C. to room temperature, but in this case 0 (degree)  C. is preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The synthetic intermediate halogen compound (iv) is synthesized by halogenation of the alcohol (i) by a standard method.
      <br/>
      For example, it is synthesized by reacting a suitable alcohol with carbon tetrahalide and triphenyl phosphine in methylene chloride.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The indole compounds used in the present invention may be synthesized from a readily available other indole compound by a standard method.
      <br/>
      For example, a suitable indole compound may lead to a formylindole compound by a Vilsmeier reagent, or an indole compound may lead to an acylindole compound by an acid chloride or acid anhydride by a Friedel Crafts reaction.
      <br/>
      As a preferable process, condensation under Vilsmeier-Haack reaction conditions of, for example, dimethylformamide in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride may be mentioned.

    <p num="417">(Pharmacological Activity on Antigen-Induced Bronchoconstriction Model of Guinea Pig)</p>
    <p num="418">
      Guinea pigs sensitized by ovalbumin were used and orally administered with the test compound suspended in 5% gum arabic.
      <br/>
      The activity for inhibiting antigen-induced bronchoconstriction after one hour after administration was measured by the Konzett-Rossler method.
    </p>
    <p num="419">
      Each of the sensitized guinea pigs was anesthesized by 35 mg/kg pentobarbital, a cannula was inserted into the respiratory tract and connected to an artificial respirator, a cannula was inserted into the jugular vein, and treatment was performed by 5 mg/kg suxamethonium and 5 g/kg mepyramine.
      <br/>
      Next, the guinea pig was inhaled a nebulized ovalbumin to cause bronchoconstriction and the activity in inhibiting bronchoconstriction was found from the ratio of the amount of overflow volume to the detector to the amount of air blown volume from the artificial respirator.
    </p>
    <p num="420">
      As the test compound, the Compounds 19, 26, and 33 were used.
      <br/>
      As the control, the thromboxane synthase inhibitor OKY-046 and the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor A-64077 were used.
      <br/>
      The results are shown in Table 4:

      From the results of the Test Examples 1 to 3, it is learned that the present compounds have the two activities of a lipoxygenase inhibitory activity and a thromboxane synthase inhibitory activity.
      <br/>
      Further, from Test Example 4, it is learned that since an effect of inhibition of bronchoconstriction is exhibited in an antigen-induced respiratory constriction model of guinea pigs, the compounds are useful as drugs for the treatment of asthma.
