    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention provides 6-amino-3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-2H-naphthalen-1-one oximes and hydrazones which are useful in treating Parkinson's disease.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the part of the brain that controls motor function.
      <br/>
      The disease is characterized by progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive disability, and death.
      <br/>
      Conventional treatments employ 3-hydroxy-L-tyrosine, commonly referred to as levodopa or L-DOPA. L-DOPA is a precursor in the natural production of dopamine, and it enhances levels of dopamine in the central nervous system.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, L-DOPA loses its efficacy after prolonged use, presumably because of the continued degeneration of the neurons that convert it to dopamine.
      <br/>
      Prolonged treatment generally requires the use of additional dopaminergic agonists be used in combination with L-DOPA.
      <br/>
      Typical agents commonly utilized in adjunctive therapy with L-DOPA include pergolide and bromocryptine.
      <br/>
      Such agents often cause undesirable side-effects such as adverse cardiac effects, increased states of confusion and hallucinations, and exacerbation of pre-existing dyskinesia.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The need continues to find new agents that are useful to treat Parkinson's disease.
      <br/>
      Ideally, an agent
    </p>
    <p num="5">will replace the use of L-DOPA completely, and be sufficiently effective and safe such that adjunctive</p>
    <p num="6">
      therapy with additional drugs is obviated.
      <br/>
      We have now discovered a series of oxime and hydrazone derivatives of a naphthalenone which exhibit good in vivo agonist activity at both the D1 and the D2 dopamine receptors.
      <br/>
      The compounds are thus useful for treating Parkinson's disease.

    <p num="13">The invention additionally provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of Formula I admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, excipient, or carrier thereof.</p>
    <p num="14">Another embodiment of this invention is a method for treating Parkinson's disease comprising administering to a human having Parkinson's disease and in need of treatment an effective amount of a compound of Formula I.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      R1 in Formula I includes "C1 -C6 alkyl," which term means a straight or branched hydrocarbon moiety having from one to six carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Typical of such groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, 1,1-dimethylbutyl, and 1ethylbutyl.
      <br/>
      The term "(CH2)n phenyl" means phenylmethyl, 2-phenylethyl, and 3phenylpropyl.
      <br/>
      The term "(CH2)n -substituted phenyl" means the foregoing groups wherein the phenyl is substituted with 1, 2, or 3 groups selected from hydroxy, C1 -C6 alkoxy, halo (chloro, fluoro, bromo, or iodo), C1 -C6 alkyl, nitro, amino, C1 -C6 alkylamino, or di-C1 -C6 alkylamino.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      R2 in Formula I can be alkyl, alkylphenyl, and alkyl-substituted phenyl, as well as (CH2)n -thienyl.
      <br/>
      The latter term means a C1 -C3 alkylene group having a terminal thienyl substituent, for example, a 2-thienyl or 3-thienyl group.
      <br/>
      Typical examples include 3-thienylmethyl, 2-(2-thienyl)ethyl, and 3-(2-thienyl)propyl.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The compounds of Formula I can be prepared from readily available starting materials, utilizing routine synthetic procedures well known to organic chemists.
      <br/>
      Both the oximes and the hydrazones are preferably prepared from the corresponding hexahydro naphthyl ketone, a compound having the formula  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="18">The ketone is readily prepared by reacting 1,3-cyclohexanedione, paraformaldehyde, acetone, and an amine of the Formula HNR2 R3 to form an eneamine, followed by reduction with agents such as sodium cyanoborohydride.</p>
    <p num="19">
      Oximes of Formula I are prepared by reacting the naphthyl ketone with hydroxylamine, alkoxyamine, or a phenoxy or substituted phenoxy amine.
      <br/>
      The reaction proceeds according to the following scheme:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The reaction generally is carried out by mixing the naphthyl ketone with an excess of amine, for instance about 0.1 to about 1.0 molar excess.
      <br/>
      The reaction is typically carried out in an organic solvent, for example an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, or an ester such as ethyl acetate or the like.
      <br/>
      The reaction generally is substantially complete after about 6 to 24 hours when conducted at a temperature of about 10 (degree)  C. to about 60 (degree)  C. The product oxime is easily isolated by removing the reaction solvent, and it can be further purified, if desired, by routine methods such as crystallization, chromatography, salt formation, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The hydrazones of Formula I are prepared by reacting a hydrazine of the formula H2 N--NHR1 with the naphthyl ketone.
      <br/>
      The reaction is depicted by the following scheme:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The reaction is carried out in a manner similar to that described above for the oximes; namely, the naphthyl ketone is reacted with an equimolar or slight excess of a hydrazine.
      <br/>
      The reaction generally is carried out in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol, and typically is complete after about 6 to about 24 hours.
      <br/>
      The product hydrazone is readily isolated and purified by routine methods.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      All of the compounds of Formula I may exist in the form of syn- and anti-isomers by virtue of the imine nitrogen atom.
      <br/>
      While the anti-isomers are preferred and are normally obtained, the invention includes the individual isomers as well as mixtures of isomers.
      <br/>
      The individual isomers can be isolated by routine methods such as chromatography over solid supports such as silica gel, or crystallization from solvents such as ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, acetone, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The invention compounds readily form acid addition salts by reaction with common organic and inorganic acids.
      <br/>
      Typical acids routinely used to make the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the invention include hydrochloric and hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, formic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, citric acid, hydroxyethylsulfonic acid, benzoic acid, and the like.

      A standard in vivo assay was carried out as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, weight approximately 280 g at surgery are used.
      <br/>
      Thirty minutes prior to surgery, the rat is injected IP with a mixture of desipramine 25 mg/kg (to protect norepinephrine-containing neurons) and pargyline 25 mg/kg (to potentiate the effect of 6-hydroxydopamine) in sterile saline, injection volume 5 mL/kg.
      <br/>
      The rat is anesthetized approximately 20 minutes later with chloral hydrate 400 mg/kg IP, (concentration 40 mg/mL to avoid adynamic ileus), the fur on the scalp is clipped, and the rat's head is mounted into a stereotaxic frame.
      <br/>
      Aseptic surgical technique is maintained.
      <br/>
      The scalp is cleaned and an incision made sagittally along the midline.
      <br/>
      The scalp and periosteum are reflected back, and a burr hole made in the skull overlying the medial forebrain bundle (MFB).
      <br/>
      An injection needle connected to a Hamilton microliter syringe is lowered through the burr hole into the right MFB (posterior 4.8 mm from bregma, lateral 1.1 mm from midline, ventral 8.2 mm from brain surface). 6-Hydroxydopamine HBr, 8  MU g/4  MU L dissolved in sterile saline with 0.1% ascorbic acid, is injected over 5 minutes using an Orion Sage Model 341B syringe pump.
      <br/>
      The needle is allowed to remain in place 4 minutes after the injection is completed and then removed.
      <br/>
      The burr hole is sealed with bone wax, and the skin incision closed with wound clips.
      <br/>
      The rat is placed in a recovery cage, with a heating pad underneath, and allowed to recover from anesthesia before being returned to its home cage.
      <br/>
      The rat's behavior, food intake, and wound condition is monitored daily following surgery.
      <br/>
      Any signs of infection or distress will be dealt with in accordance with advice from LAR.
      <br/>
      The wound clips are removed 7 to 10 days postsurgery.
      <br/>
      Lesioned animals appear behaviorally normal, unless given dopamine (DA) agonists.

    <p num="46">
      Following a 3-week period for recovery and for the development of DA receptor supersensitivity in the lesioned side of the brain, the rat is taken from its home cage, weighed, and connected to an automated rotation counting apparatus (RotoRat, MED Associates).
      <br/>
      The rat has a fabric harness fastened about its torso, which is connected by a flexible spring to an electromechanical swivel mounted in an overhead frame.
      <br/>
      The rat is placed in a large steel bowl (47 cm top diameter) in which it may move freely below the swivel.
      <br/>
      The bowl is surrounded by and opaque barrier to isolate the rat from its surroundings.
      <br/>
      Movements of the rat in clockwise and counterclockwise directions are counted and recorded on-line by computer.
      <br/>
      Experimental sessions last from 1 to 12 hours, with 3 to 6 hours being typical.
      <br/>
      Following the experiment, the rat is returned to its home cage.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      At the first postsurgery session, each rat is dosed with apomorphine 50  MU g/kg SC.
      <br/>
      This drug is a direct acting DA agonist and will induce contraversive (away from the lesioned side) rotation in lesioned rats.
      <br/>
      This movement is counterclockwise in rats lesioned in the right MFB.
      <br/>
      Any rats not exhibiting at least 100 contraversive rotations in the hour following apomorphine injection are regarded as having an incomplete lesion and are removed from further use and euthanized.

      Another assay utilized to measure DA agonist activity of the invention compounds involves examining their ability to alter the increase in L-DOPA synthesis and the inhibition of L-DOPA decarboxylase caused by gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine HCl (NSD 1015).
      <br/>
      GBL causes an increase in L-DOPA synthesis in rat corpus striatum and mesolimbic regions of brain tissue.
      <br/>
      NSD 1015 slows the metabolism of L-DOPA.

      The compounds of the present invention can be prepared and administered in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
      <br/>
      For instance, the compounds can be administered by injection, that is, intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneously, intraduodenally, or intraperitoneally.
      <br/>
      Also, the compounds of the present invention can be administered by inhalation, for example, intranasally, as well as transdermally and orally.
      <br/>
      It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise as the active component, either a compound of Formula I or a corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of Formula I. The active compound generally is present in a concentration of about 5% to about 95% by weight of the formulation.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid.
      <br/>
      Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules.
      <br/>
      A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.
    </p>
    <p num="58">In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component.</p>
    <p num="59">In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.</p>
    <p num="60">
      The powders and tablets preferably contain from 5% or 10% to about 70% of the active compound.
      <br/>
      Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like.
      <br/>
      The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without other carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it.
      <br/>
      Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included.
      <br/>
      Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring.
      <br/>
      The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water propylene glycol solutions.
      <br/>
      For parenteral injection, liquid preparations can be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.
    </p>
    <p num="63">Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing, and thickening agents as desired.</p>
    <p num="64">Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well-known suspending agents.</p>
    <p num="65">
      Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration.
      <br/>
      Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions.
      <br/>
      These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form.
      <br/>
      In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component.
      <br/>
      The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules.
      <br/>
      Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from 1 mg to 1000 mg, preferably 10 mg to 100 mg according to the particular application and the potency of the active component.

      In therapeutics use as agents for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, the compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of this invention are administered at a dose that is effective to increase the production of dopamine by brain neurons.
      <br/>
      The initial dosage of about 1 to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight daily will be effective.
      <br/>
      A daily dose range of about 25 to about 75 mg per kilogram is preferred.
      <br/>
      The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed.
      <br/>
      Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art.
      <br/>
      Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstance is reached.
      <br/>
      For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired.
      <br/>
      Typical dosages will be from about 0.1 to about 500 mg/kg, and ideally about 25 to about 250 mg/kg.
