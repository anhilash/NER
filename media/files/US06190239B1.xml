    <heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
    <p num="1">This application is a division of my prior application No. 08/922,070, filed Sep. 2, 1997, and now U.S. Pat. No. 5,947,797 and entitled Computer-Controlled Method and Apparatus for Polishing (Amended) which in turn was based upon my Provisional Application No. 60/025,906, filed on Sep. 11, 1996.</p>
    <heading>FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention pertains to a polishing method and more particularly to a method for controlling the movement of a polishing member along a predetermined path.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Fiber optic connectors are required in large quantities in the telecommunications and cable TV markets for the manufacture of fiber optic cable assemblies and components.
      <br/>
      Current fiber optic connector polishers (a) polish only in a circular pattern which does not polish the face ends of fiber optic connectors as effectively as does a figure eight polishing, and (b) these current polishers can polish no more than eighteen connectors at one time.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The existing state of the art for fiber optic connector polishers is derived from modifications of gemstone polishing machines.
      <br/>
      These machines consisted of a rotating platter against which the gemstone was moved for polishing.
      <br/>
      This technique was adopted by the first fiber optic connector polishers, and then modified to their current state, by having a jig, holding no more than eighteen connectors, move, in small circles on the rotating platter, while endeavoring, unsuccessfully, to simulate a constant, figure eight polishing pattern.
      <br/>
      The figure eight polishing pattern, if it can be perfectly attained and maintained during the polishing operation, provides the optimum method of polishing the end faces of fiber optic connectors in that perfect figure eight pattern produces the most consistent radii and best polish obtainable on these connectors and similarly configured industrial components.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="5">
      A polishing method is provided for creating and maintaining a substantially perfect figure eight polishing pattern for polishing fiber optic connectors and similarly configured industrial components.
      <br/>
      Further, the method is capable of simultaneously performing this figure eight polishing pattern on a multiplicity of such connectors and components.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the specific embodiment disclosed includes a computer program that controls the method.
      <br/>
      By simultaneously polishing a minimum of forty-eight fiber optic connectors, or similarly configured industrial components--with the polish being better than any now capable of being obtained in the prior art --this invention will enable the output of polished fiber optic connectors and similar industrial components to be increased three to fourfold over currently employed polishing machines, while reducing significantly the cost of such polishing.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 1 is a schematic top view of a polishing apparatus capable of performing the polishing method of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a schematic side elevation of the polishing apparatus and also shows a jig for mounting a component to be polished, as used to carry out the subject method.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 are a schematic diagrams showing the path and direction of movement of the base plate as controlled by the subject polishing method.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      As illustrated by FIGS. 1 and 2, the layout of the polishing apparatus capable of performing the polishing method allows the use of all the space on the polishing surface.
      <br/>
      By using a rectangular array the connectors are spaced at one inch intervals and create an array which can be expanded to as many as two hundred connectors to be polished simultaneously.
      <br/>
      Polishing machines now in use do not allow for this type of expansion in that they can only place the connectors in the outermost edges of the polishing plate.
      <br/>
      As illustrated by FIG. 3, the polishing apparatus can accurately produce a constant and perfect figure eight polishing pattern and move this pattern in any direction by using the invention's computer controlled x-y motion control process with circular interpolation.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The polisher (FIGS. 1 and 2) includes a casing 13.
      <br/>
      Installed within the casing is an x-stage 1, a y-stage 2, an interface plate 12, a base plate 5, motor drives 6, a power supply 11, an x-y controller 7, an x-motor 15, and a y-motor 14.
      <br/>
      The mechanical components for the motion system comprise the x-stage 2 mounted to the casing 13, the y-stage 1 mounted to the x-stage 2, the interface plate 12 mounted to the y-stage 1, and the base plate 5 mounted to the interface plate 12.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The x-stage 2 and the y-stage 1 are moved via the motors 15 and 14, respectively, attached to these stages.
      <br/>
      The y-motor 14 attached to the y-stage 1 moves this stage in the y-axis by a ball screw mechanism built into the stage.
      <br/>
      The x-motor 15 attached to the x-stage 2 moves the x-stage 2 in the x-axis.
      <br/>
      The y-stage 1 and the x-stage 2 are controlled by an x-y controller 7 and motor drives 6 which are powered by a power supply 11.
      <br/>
      The controller 7 is a computer-controlled motion system which can be programmed for all types of movement.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The interface plate 12 (FIGS. 1 and 2) is attached to the y-stage 1 as a receiving mechanism for the base plate 5 to which is attached the polishing surface for operation of the polisher apparatus.
      <br/>
      Different polishing surfaces can be attached to the base plate 5 for the polishing process.
      <br/>
      These surfaces include such polishing mediums as diamond, aluminum oxide, and silicon carbide polishing papers and other coated plates and pads.
      <br/>
      The polishing plate 3 is set on the fixed locating members 4 so that the exposed surface of the component to be polished is touching the polishing surface which is applied to the base plate 5.
      <br/>
      Weights 16 are then applied to the top surface of the polishing plate 3 to supply the correct amount of pressure to the component to be polished.
      <br/>
      The pressure may also be applied via a pneumatic pressure control system.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The method (FIGS. 1 and 2) is controlled by a timer 10, a start switch 9 and a stop switch 8.
      <br/>
      The amount of time to polish is set on the timer.
      <br/>
      The process is started by pressing the start switch 9.
      <br/>
      The polishing process can be stopped at any time by pressing the stop switch 8.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In the disclosed embodiment the figure eight pattern 1' (FIG. 3) is created by computer programming the x-y motion process to move in a clockwise circle starting from the center of the figure eight, then moving in a counter clockwise circle to finish the figure eight pattern.
      <br/>
      The offset figure eight pattern 2' is created by moving the figure eight pattern 1' down in one direction 3' a small amount (approximately 0.50 inch).
      <br/>
      This pattern is repeated several times to a specified distance.
      <br/>
      Upon completion of this movement, the figure eight pattern 1' is reversed.
      <br/>
      It then moves in the opposite direction 4' and continues until it reaches a specified distance.
      <br/>
      The whole process is repeated as many times as needed to perform the desired amount of time set by the timer (see 10, FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      By combining these patterns the process creates a continuous figure eight movement which enables the polishing surface of the polishing method to provide the optimum quality polishing, simultaneously, of not less than forty-eight fiber optic connectors or similarly configured industrial components.
    </p>
    <p num="19">The computer program for the figure eight pattern is as follows:</p>
