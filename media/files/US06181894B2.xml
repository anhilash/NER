      A copying apparatus includes an original feed unit for feeding originals stacked on the stacking position to an exposure position one by one, an exposure unit for exposing an image on the original fed to the exposure position, and an image forming unit for forming the image exposed by the exposure unit onto a sheet, the image forming unit being able to operate in a first mode for forming an image on a single original on a single sheet, and a second mode for forming images on a plurality of originals on a single sheet.
      <br/>
      The original feed unit includes a first feed unit for feeding the originals stacked at the stacking position in turn from the last page, and a second feed unit for feeding the originals stacked at the stacking position in turn from the first page.
      <br/>
      When the image forming unit operates in the first mode, the first feed unit feeds the originals.
      <br/>
      When the image forming unit operates in the second mode, the second feed unit feeds the originals.

    <p num="4">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">Conventionally, there is no image forming apparatus comprising an original feeder that can separate each one of a plurality of originals placed on an original table with their original surfaces facing up (to be referred to as a "face-up state" hereinafter) or their original surfaces facing down (to be referred to as a "face-down state" hereinafter) either from the uppermost or lowermost original in turn, and that can automatically feed the separated original to an image reading position.</p>
    <p num="6">Conventionally, there is provided an image forming apparatus comprising an original feeder, which separates each one of a plurality of originals placed on an original table in the face-up state only from the lowermost original in turn and automatically feeds the separated original to the image reading position, or an image forming apparatus comprising an original feeder, which separates each one of a plurality of originals placed on an original table in the face-down state only from the uppermost original in turn and automatically feeds the separated original to the image reading position.</p>
    <p num="7">
      However, in the image forming apparatus comprising the original feeder which separates each one of a plurality of originals placed on the original table in the face-up state only from the lowermost original in turn and automatically feeds the separated original to the image reading position, or the original feeder which separates each one of a plurality of originals placed on the original table in the face-down state only from the uppermost original in turn and automatically feeds the separated original to the image reading position, image formation is started from the last page of a bundle of originals.
      <br/>
      For this reason, when the image formation mode is a mode for forming images on both surfaces of sheets on the basis of one-side originals, image formation is started after the number of originals is temporarily counted to discriminate if the number of originals is an odd or even number, or after a user inputs data indicating that the number of originals is an odd or even number.
      <br/>
      Similarly, when the image formation mode is a mode for forming images on a plurality of originals on a single sheet, the number of originals is temporarily counted, or a user inputs the number of originals.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the efficiency of image formation is considerably impaired, or a user is required to perform cumbersome operations.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      On the other hand, when an image forming apparatus has a function of facsimile-transmitting a read image, a function of storing a read image in a file, and a function of transferring an image to an external computer, and comprises an original feeder which separates each one of a plurality of originals placed on an original table in the face-up state only from the lowermost original in turn and automatically feeds the separated original to the image reading position, or an original feeder which separates each one of a plurality of originals placed on an original table in the face-down state only from the uppermost original in turn and automatically feeds the separated original to the image reading position, the original reading operation is started from the last page of the plurality of originals.
      <br/>
      For this reason, in the case of a facsimile apparatus for transmitting images from the first page or an image file apparatus for storing images from the first page, all the pieces of original information must be temporarily stored in an image memory, and thereafter, the stored information must be processed from the first page, resulting in an increase in cost of the overall apparatus.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">It is an object of the present invention to provide a copying apparatus which can solve the above-mentioned problems.</p>
    <p num="10">It is another object of the present invention to provide a copying apparatus which can improve image formation efficiency without requiring cumbersome operations to a user, and can attain cost reductions of the apparatus itself since it can separate originals placed on an original table either from the uppermost or lowermost original.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="13">(First Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="14">FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing the arrangement of an image forming apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring to FIG. 1, an image input apparatus (to be referred to as a "reader unit" hereinafter) 1 serves as first image input means, and converts an original image into image data.
      <br/>
      An image output apparatus (to be referred to as a "printer unit" hereinafter) 2 serves as image output means, and has a plurality of different sheet stackers.
      <br/>
      The printer unit 2 outputs image data on a sheet as a visible image in response to a print command.
      <br/>
      An external apparatus 3 is electrically connected to the reader unit 1, and has various functions.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the external apparatus 3 serving as second image input means comprises a facsimile unit 4 for performing facsimile transmission/reception, a file unit 5 for converting various kinds of original information into electrical signals, and storing the converted signals in a magnetooptical disk, an external memory apparatus 6 connected to the file unit 5, a computer interface unit 7 for connection to a computer or a LAN, a formatter unit 8 for converting information from the computer into a visible image, an image memory unit 9 for temporarily storing information sent from the computer, a core unit 10 for controlling the above-mentioned functions, and the like.
      <br/>
      A reader controller CONT1 and a printer controller CONT2 can communicate with the core unit of the external apparatus 3, and each comprise a CPU, ROM, RAM, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="16">As shown in FIG. 1, the external apparatus 3 is connected to the reader unit 1 using a cable via a selector 11, and the core unit 10 in the external apparatus 3 controls signals and respective functions.</p>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 2 is a sectional view showing the arrangement of the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      The arrangement and operation of the first embodiment will be explained below.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Originals which are stacked, in the face-up state, on a stacker tray 301 of an original feeder 101 are sequentially conveyed one by one onto a platen glass 102.
      <br/>
      The stacker tray 301 has a widthwise direction regulating plate for regulating an original in its widthwise direction perpendicular to its feed direction so as not to skew the original in an original feed operation.
      <br/>
      The regulating plate is slidable in a direction perpendicular to the feed direction of the original.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A lower separation operation of a bundle of originals on the stacker tray 301 will be explained below.
      <br/>
      The bundle of originals are separated one by one from the lowermost original by a semicircular roller 303 and separation rollers 304, and the separated original is conveyed to the exposure position on the platen glass 102 by convey rollers 305 and an endless belt 306.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, an image reading operation is started.
      <br/>
      Upon completion of the image reading operation, the original on the platen glass 102 is returned to the uppermost surface of the bundle of originals by convey rollers 307 and exhaust rollers 308.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      An upper separation operation of a bundle of originals on the stacker tray 301 will be explained below.
      <br/>
      The bundle of originals are separated one by one from the uppermost original by a pickup roller 309 and the separation rollers 304, and the separated original is conveyed to the exposure position on the platen glass 102 by the convey rollers 305 and the endless belt 306.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, an image reading operation is started.
      <br/>
      Upon completion of the image reading operation, the original on the platen glass 102 is exhausted onto an external exhaust tray 312 by external exhaust rollers 310.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In the case of a both-side original, the original is temporarily guided to the image reading position, as described above, and upon completion of the image reading operation, a pivotal flapper 311 is switched to the upper side to guide the leading end of the original to a path defined by the flapper 311.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the original is conveyed onto the platen glass 102 by the convey rollers 305 and the endless belt 306.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the original is reversed upon rotation of the convey rollers 307.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      When the original is conveyed to a predetermined position on the platen glass 102, a lamp 103 of a scanner unit 104 is turned on, and the scanner unit 104 moves to irradiate light onto the original.
      <br/>
      Light reflected by the original is incident on a CCD image sensor (to be referred to as a "CCD" hereinafter) 109 via mirrors 105, 106, and 107, and a lens 108.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      An image processing unit 110 performs image processing set by an operation unit.
      <br/>
      The image processing unit 110 has an image memory, and has a function of rotating the output direction of an image.
      <br/>
      Note that an external switching circuit of the image processing unit 110 comprises the selector 11 for switching a signal from the reader unit 1 to the printer unit 2 or the external apparatus 3, and has a function of selecting one of signals from the reader unit 1 and the external apparatus 3 and connecting the selected signal to the printer unit 2.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      An electrical signal connected to the printer unit 2 by the external switching circuit of the image processing unit 110 is converted into a modulated optical signal by an exposure control unit 201, and the converted optical signal is irradiated onto a photosensitive body 202.
      <br/>
      A latent image formed on the photosensitive body 202 by the irradiated light is developed by a developer 203.
      <br/>
      A sheet is conveyed from a sheet stacker 204 or 205 in synchronism with the timing of the leading end of the latent image, and the developed image is transferred onto the conveyed sheet by a transfer unit 206.
      <br/>
      The transferred image is fixed on the sheet by a fixing unit 207, and thereafter, the sheet is exhausted outside the apparatus by an exhaust unit 208.
    </p>
    <p num="25">The sheet output from the exhaust unit 208 enters a staple sorter 400.</p>
    <p num="26">The staple sorter 400 has a 20-bin stationary tray 412, and performs sorting.</p>
    <p num="27">
      In a sort mode, copied sheets are sequentially exhausted from the exhaust unit 208 of the main body, enter convey rollers 401 of the sorter 400, and are exhausted onto the respective bins of the tray 412 via a convey path 403 and exhaust rollers 405.
      <br/>
      Every time a sheet is exhausted onto a bin, the bins are vertically moved by a bin shift motor (not shown), thus performing sorting.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the staple mode is selected, and a staple signal is input from the printer unit, the sheets on each bin are stapled by a stapler 420 while moving the bins one by one by the bin shift motor.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Subsequently, a method of outputting sequentially read images on the two surfaces of a single sheet will be explained below.</p>
    <p num="29">
      After a sheet fixed by the fixing unit 207 is temporarily conveyed to the exhaust unit 208, the convey direction of the sheet is reversed, and the sheet is conveyed to a re-feed sheet stacker 210 via a convey direction switching member 209.
      <br/>
      When the next original is prepared, the original image is read in the same manner as in the above-mentioned process.
      <br/>
      In this case, since the sheet is fed from the re-feed sheet stacker 210, two original images can be consequently output onto the upper and lower surfaces of the single sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="30">A method of reversing and exhausting a sheet will be explained below.</p>
    <p num="31">
      A sheet on which an image is fixed by the fixing unit 207 is conveyed to reversal rollers 211 by temporarily pivoting the convey direction switching member 209 upward.
      <br/>
      After the sheet has passed the convey direction switching member 209, the reversal rollers 211 are rotated in the reverse direction to convey the sheet to the exhaust unit 208.
      <br/>
      When originals which are placed in the face-up state and are fed from the original feeder by the upper separation are to be copied, copied sheets are exhausted in the above-mentioned manner so as to prevent the page order of the copied sheets from being reversed.
    </p>
    <p num="32">FIG. 3 is a plan view showing an example of an operation panel 500 disposed on the reader unit 1 shown in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="33">
      Referring to FIG. 3, a display unit 501 displays operation states and messages.
      <br/>
      The surface of the display unit 501 comprises a touch panel, which serves as function keys when it is touched.
      <br/>
      A ten-key pad 502 is used for inputting numeric values.
      <br/>
      A start key 503 is used for starting an operation when it is depressed.
    </p>
    <p num="34">The operation will be described below with reference to the flow charts shown in FIGS. 4 to 9.</p>
    <p num="35">
      Referring to FIG. 4, initialization is performed after the power switch is turned on (step S41).
      <br/>
      Operation mode selection keys are displayed on the display unit 501 on the operation panel, and an operation mode is selected when the panel on the corresponding selection key is touched.
      <br/>
      It is checked if the selected mode is the copy mode (step S42).
      <br/>
      If YES in step S42, the flow jumps to step A; otherwise, it is checked if the selected mode is the facsimile-transmit mode (step S43).
      <br/>
      If YES in step S43, the flow jumps to step B; otherwise, it is checked if the selected mode is the file mode (step S44).
      <br/>
      If YES in step S44, the flow jumps to step C; otherwise, it is checked if an input from the computer interface is detected (step S45).
      <br/>
      If YES in step S45, the flow jumps to step D; otherwise, it is checked if facsimile data is received (step S46).
      <br/>
      If YES in step S46, the flow jumps to step E; otherwise, the flow returns to decision step S42 of checking if the copy mode is selected.
      <br/>
      Thus, decision steps S42 to S46 of the selected mode are repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="36">FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing the operation sequence in the copy mode.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Initialization of the copy operation is performed (step S51).
      <br/>
      Information input from the operation panel 500 using the keys of the display unit 501 and the ten-key pad 502 is read to set a copy condition (step S52), and the control waits for an input of the start key 503 (step S53).
      <br/>
      When the start key 503 is depressed, if the copy condition set in step S52 corresponds to a mode for copying a plurality of pages of original images on a single sheet such as a one-both sides copy mode for copying images on one-side originals to the two surfaces of a sheet, a reduction layout mode for copying a plurality of original images on one surface of a sheet, or the like, originals are fed from the first page by the upper separation operation (steps S54 and S56).
      <br/>
      If the copy condition set in step S52 corresponds to the staple mode, originals are fed from the first page by the upper separation operation (steps S55 and S56).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the copy condition set in step S52 corresponds to a mode for copying one original image onto a single sheet, originals are fed from the last page by the lower separation operation (step S57).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, if the lower separation operation and the reversal exhaust operation are performed, automatic density control is performed, original images are read by the reader unit 1, and image data are printed by the printer unit 2 (step S58).
      <br/>
      The print operation is as described above.
      <br/>
      After the print operation, the flow returns to step S41 in FIG. 4 to perform initialization.
      <br/>
      In the copy mode such as the one-both sides copy mode or the reduction layout mode, when originals are fed from the last page by the lower separation, originals must be fed without performing a reading operation, and the number of originals must be counted so as not to form a blank page before the first page of the recorded sheets.
      <br/>
      However, according to the present invention, since this count operation can be omitted, the processing time can be shortened.
      <br/>
      In the lower separation operation, recorded sheets are exhausted in the face-up state without being reversed, and in the upper separation operation, recorded sheets are reversed, and are exhausted in the face-down state.

    <p num="39">
      Initialization of the facsimile transmission operation is performed (step S61), and information input from the operation panel 500 using the keys of the display unit 501 and the ten-key pad 502 is read to set a facsimile-transmit condition (step S62).
      <br/>
      The control waits for an input of the start key 503 (step S63).
      <br/>
      When the start key 503 is depressed, originals are fed in turn from the first page by the original feeder 101 by the upper separation operation, and original images are read by the reader unit 1 (step S64).
      <br/>
      The read image data are supplied to the facsimile unit 4.
      <br/>
      The facsimile unit 4 performs facsimile transmission in accordance with the selected mode and a predetermined protocol (step S65).

      It is checked if the received command requests a read-in operation to the computer or an output operation from the computer (step S82).
      <br/>
      If the command requests an output operation from the computer, data is supplied to and interpreted by the formatter unit 8 via the core unit 10, and information is developed onto a bit map memory (step S83).
      <br/>
      Subsequently, in the processing in step S84, it is checked if the printer unit is operating, and the control waits for the completion of the operation.
      <br/>
      Upon completion of the operation, a proper sheet is selected, and its feed operation is started.

    <p num="55">(Modification of Embodiments)</p>
    <p num="56">
      In each of the above embodiments, original separation switching means is controlled by an output from image formation mode setting means.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the image formation mode may be controlled by an output from the original separation switching means.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      As described above, since originals can be read from the first page in a mode for copying images on one-side originals onto the two surfaces of sheets, a mode for copying a plurality of original images onto a single sheet, and the like, and the original count operation is not required in the apparatus, image formation efficiency can be improved.
      <br/>
      In addition, since a user need not input the number of originals, he or she is not required of performing cumbersome operations.
    </p>
    <p num="58">Since originals can be read from the first page in the facsimile-transmit mode, the file record mode, the transfer mode to an external computer, and the like, an image memory can be omitted, thus reducing the cost of the apparatus itself.</p>
