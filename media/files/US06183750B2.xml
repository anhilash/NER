    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a modified poxvirus and to methods of making and using the same.
      <br/>
      More in particular, the invention relates to recombinant poxvirus, which virus expresses gene products of a herpesvirus gene, and to vaccines which provide protective immunity against herpesvirus infections.
    </p>

      Several publications are referenced in this application by arabic numerals within parentheses.

      Full citation to these references is found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims.

      These references describe the state-of-the-art to which this invention pertains.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Vaccinia virus and more recently other poxviruses have been used for the insertion and expression of foreign genes.
      <br/>
      The basic technique of inserting foreign genes into live infectious poxvirus involves recombination between pox DNA sequences flanking a foreign genetic element in a donor plasmid and homologous sequences present in the rescuing poxvirus (28).
    </p>
    <p num="5">Specifically, the recombinant poxviruses are constructed in two steps known in the art and analogous to the methods for creating synthetic recombinants of the vaccinia virus described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,603,112, the disclosure of which patent is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p num="6">
      First, the DNA gene sequence to be inserted into the virus, particularly an open reading frame from a non-pox source, is placed into an E. coli plasmid construct into which DNA homologous to a section of DNA of the poxvirus has been inserted.
      <br/>
      Separately, the DNA gene sequence to be inserted is ligated to a promoter.
      <br/>
      The promoter-gene linkage is positioned in the plasmid construct so that the promoter-gene linkage is flanked on both ends by DNA homologous to a DNA sequence flanking a region of pox DNA containing a nonessential locus.
      <br/>
      The resulting plasmid construct is then amplified by growth within E. coli bacteria (11) and isolated (12,20).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Second, the isolated plasmid containing the DNA gene sequence to be inserted is transfected into a cell culture, e.g. chick embryo fibroblasts, along with the poxvirus.
      <br/>
      Recombination between homologous pox DNA in the plasmid and the viral genome respectively gives a poxvirus modified by the presence, in a nonessential region of its genome, of foreign DNA sequences.
      <br/>
      The term "foreign" DNA designates exogenous DNA, particularly DNA from a non-pox source, that codes for gene products not ordinarily produced by the genome into which the exogenous DNA is placed.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Genetic recombination is in general the exchange of homologous sections of DNA between two strands of DNA.
      <br/>
      In certain viruses RNA may replace DNA.
      <br/>
      Homologous sections of nucleic acid are sections of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) which have the same sequence of nucleotide bases.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Genetic recombination may take place naturally during the replication or manufacture of new viral genomes within the infected host cell.
      <br/>
      Thus, genetic recombination between viral genes may occur during the viral replication cycle that takes place in a host cell which is co-infected with two or more different viruses or other genetic constructs.
      <br/>
      A section of DNA from a first genome is used interchangeably in constructing the section of the genome of a second co-infecting virus in which the DNA is homologous with that of the first viral genome.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      However, recombination can also take place between sections of DNA in different genomes that are not perfectly homologous.
      <br/>
      If one such section is from a first genome homologous with a section of another genome except for the presence within the first section of, for example, a genetic marker or a gene coding for an antigenic determinant inserted into a portion of the homologous DNA, recombination can still take place and the products of that recombination are then detectable by the presence of that genetic marker or gene in the recombinant viral genome.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Successful expression of the inserted DNA genetic sequence by the modified infectious virus requires two conditions.
      <br/>
      First, the insertion must be into a nonessential region of the virus in order that the modified virus remain viable.
      <br/>
      The second condition for expression of inserted DNA is the presence of a promoter in the proper relationship to the inserted DNA.
      <br/>
      The promoter must be placed so that it is located upstream from the DNA sequence to be expressed.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      There are two subtypes of equine herpesvirus that, although they contain cross-neutralizing epitopes, can be distinguished by their antigenic profiles, restriction endonuclease fingerprints and their pathogenicity for horses (1).
      <br/>
      Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) is associated with respiratory tract disease, central nervous system disorders and classic herpetic abortions whereas equine herpesvirus 4 (EHV-4) is predominantly associated with respiratory tract disease (1,48).
      <br/>
      Equine herpesviruses are members of the alphaherpesvirus subfamily and display many of the typical biological and biochemical characteristics of human herpesviruses, such as genomic isomerization, regulation of gene expression, establishment of latent infections, generation of defective interfering virus particles, induction of neurological disorders, and in vitro oncogenic transformation (1,4,23).
      <br/>
      Thus, EHV advantageously can be used for studying the varied biological consequences of herpesvirus infections.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Herpesvirus glycoproteins mediate essential viral functions such as cellular attachment and penetration, cell to cell spread of the virus and, importantly, determine the pathogenicity profile of infection.
      <br/>
      Herpesvirus glycoproteins are critical components in the interaction with the host immune system (36,37).
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The well characterized glycoproteins of herpes simplex virus include gB, gC, gD, gE, gG, gH and gI (36,37,49-55).
      <br/>
      A number of studies have indicated the importance of herpes simplex virus glycoproteins in eliciting immune responses.
      <br/>
      Hence, it has been reported that gB and gD can elicit important immune responses (6,8,13,18,21,22,26,27,30,44,46,47). gC can stimulate class I restricted cytotoxic lymphocytes (15,32) whereas gD can stimulate class II cytotoxic T cell responses (21,22,44,46,47). gG was shown to be a target for complement-dependent antibody directed virus neutralization (38,39).
      <br/>
      A number of glycoproteins from other herpesviruses have also been shown to elicit important immune responses (5,10,36,56).
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Both subtypes of EHV express six abundant glycoproteins (1,3,43).
      <br/>
      The genomic portions of the DNA sequences encoding gp2, gp10, gp13, gp14, gp17/18, and gp21/22a have been determined using lambda gt11 expression vectors and monoclonal antibodies (3).
      <br/>
      Glycoproteins gp13 and gp14 were located in the same locations within the L component of the genome to which the gC and gB homologs, respectively, of herpes simplex virus map (3).
      <br/>
      EHV-1 appears unique among the alphaherpesviruses whose glycoprotein genes have been mapped in that five of its six major glycoproteins are encoded from sequences within the genome L component while only one (gp17/18) is mapped to the US region.
      <br/>
      Analyzing these data, it has been predicted that some of the low-abundance glycoproteins identified in EHV-1 virions as well as EHV-1 glycoproteins not yet identified map to the S component of the genome (3).
      <br/>
      The envelope glycoproteins are the principal immunogens of herpesviruses involved in eliciting both humoral and cellular host immune responses (5,8,73-75) and so are of the highest interest for those attempting to design vaccines.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Recently, the nucleotide sequence of the Kentucky T431 strain of the EHV-1 transcriptional unit encoding gp13 has been reported (2).
      <br/>
      An open reading frame encodes a 468 amino acid primary translation product of 51 kDa.
      <br/>
      The protein has the characteristic features of a membrane-spanning protein with nine potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) present in the surface domain between the putative signal and transmembrane anchor portions of the protein (2).
      <br/>
      The glycoprotein was shown to be homologous to the herpes simplex virus (HSV) gC-1 and gC-2, to the pseudorabies virus (PRV) gIII and the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) gpV (2).
      <br/>
      EHV-1 gp13 is thus the structural homolog of the herpesvirus gc-like glycoproteins.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The nucleotide sequence of EHV-1 gp14 (71,72) has recently been reported.
      <br/>
      Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of gp14 glycoprotein revealed significant homology to the corresponding glycoprotein of HSV, gB.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Monoclonal antibodies directed against some EHV-1 glycoproteins have been shown to be neutralizing (76).
      <br/>
      Passive immunization experiments demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies directed against gp13 or gp14 (77) or against gp13, gp14 or gp17/18 (78) could protect hamsters against a lethal challenge.
      <br/>
      Other gB and gC glycoprotein analogs are-also involved in protection against diseases caused by alphaherpesviruses (8,10,73).
      <br/>
      The EHV-1 gp17/18 glycoprotein, although characterized as another potential protective immunogen, had until now no known structural counterpart among the several glycoproteins encoded from the S component in the other alphaherpesviruses (66,79,80).
      <br/>
      Based on its genomic position, it has been speculated that gp17/18 could be the HSV gE analog (2).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Pseudorabies virus (PRV), an alphaherpesvirus, is the causative agent of Aujesky's disease.
      <br/>
      The disease is highly infectious causing serious economic losses in the swine industry.
      <br/>
      The disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality among piglets and is characterized by severe respiratory illness, abortions, reduced litter size and decreased growth rates of survivors.
      <br/>
      Fatal encephalitis is a frequent consequence of infection.
      <br/>
      Latent viral infections, a characteristic of herpes viruses, can be established thus allowing recovered adult swine to serve as chronic carriers of the virus.
      <br/>
      For a recent extensive review see Wittmann and Rziha (81).
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The PRV genome consists of a 90 * 106 dalton double stranded DNA (82) separated by inverted repeat sequences into unique long (UL) or unique short (US) segments (83,84).
      <br/>
      The PRV genome encodes approximately 100 polypeptides whose expression is regulated in a cascade-like fashion similar to other herpesviruses (85,86).
      <br/>
      To date, five glycoproteins gpI, gpII, gpIII, gp63 and gp50 have been shown to be associated with the viral envelope and associated with the various membranous structures of PRV infected cells (80,86-91).
      <br/>
      A sixth PRV encoded glycoprotein (gX) is released into the culture medium (92).
      <br/>
      The physical location of these glycoproteins on the PRV genome and their DNA sequence are currently known (62,80,91-98).
      <br/>
      As with the glycoproteins of other herpesviruses, the PRV glycoproteins mediate essential viral functions such as cellular attachment and penetration into or release from cells.
      <br/>
      The PRV glycoproteins are critical in the pathogenicity profile of PRV infection and are critical components in the resolution of disease and the immune status.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      PRV gpI is non-essential for virus replication in vitro and in vivo and is absent from most attenuated PRV strains (99).
      <br/>
      The attenuated nature of these gI-deleted strains also indicates a possible role for gI in virulence (99,100).
      <br/>
      Other PRV proteins, however, appear to be involved in this function since expression of gI alone is not sufficient to produce high levels of virulence (100).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The role gI plays in eliciting an immune response against PRV is unclear.
      <br/>
      Monoclonal antibodies against gI can neutralize virus in vitro (101) and passively protect immunized mice against a lethal PRV challenge (81).
      <br/>
      Kost et al. (98) have recently described the expression of PRV gpI in vaccinia virus recombinants either alone or in association with gp50 and gp63.
      <br/>
      Intracranial inoculation of the vaccinia recombinants in mice resulted in increased virulence particularly when PRV gpI was associated with coexpression of gp50 and gp63.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In swine, however, neutralizing antibodies against gI are not produced (5).
      <br/>
      In addition, a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing PRV gI-encoded polypeptides (98) does not protect mice against a lethal PRV challenge (relative to the protection afforded by the wildtype vaccinia virus control).
      <br/>
      These data, taken together, suggest that PRV gpI is more appropriate as a diagnostic probe rather than as a component in a subunit vaccine.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      PRV glycoprotein gp63 is located adjacent to gp50 in the US region of the PRV genome (80).
      <br/>
      The coding sequence for PRV gp63 starts with three consecutive ATG codons approximately 20 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon of gp50.
      <br/>
      There is no recognizable transcriptional signal motif and translation probably occurs from the same transcript as gp50.
      <br/>
      PRV gp63 is non-essential in vitro (88).
      <br/>
      PRV gp63 as a continuous DNA sequence with PRV gp50 has been expressed in vaccinia virus as reported by Kost et al. (98).
      <br/>
      The contribution of PRV gp63 to protection in mice against PRV challenge is difficult to assess since those studies did not dissect the contributions of PRV gp50 and gp63.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      PRV glycoprotein gX is a non-structural glycoprotein whose end product is secreted into the extracellular fluid (85,92).
      <br/>
      No in vitro neutralization of PRV was obtained with either polyclonal or monoclonal sera to PRVgX (102,103) and subunit gX vaccines were non-protective against challenge (104).
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      PRV glycoprotein gp50 is the Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) gD analog (97).
      <br/>
      The DNA open reading frame encodes 402 amino acids (95).
      <br/>
      The mature glycosylated form (50-60 kDa) contains O-linked carbohydrate without N-linked glycosylation (95).
      <br/>
      Swine serum is highly reactive with PRV gp50, suggesting its importance as an immunogen.
      <br/>
      Monoclonal antibodies to gp50 neutralize PRV in vitro with or without complement (97,105,106) and passively protect nice (102,105,106) and swine (102).
      <br/>
      Vaccinia virus recombinants expressing PRV gp50 induced serum neutralizing antibodies and protected both mice and swine against lethal PRV challenge (98,107,108).
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The PRV gpIII gene is located in the UL region of the genome.
      <br/>
      The 1437 bp open reading frame encodes a protein of 479 amino acids.
      <br/>
      The 50.9 kDa deduced primary translation product has eight potential N-linked glycosylation sites (96).
      <br/>
      PRV gIII is the HSV-1 gC analog (96).
      <br/>
      Functional replacement of PRV gIII by HSVgC was not observed (109).
      <br/>
      Although PRV gIII is nonessential for replication in vitro (110,111), the mature glycosylated form (98 kDa) is an abundant constituent of the PRV envelope.
      <br/>
      Anti-gpIII monoclonal antibodies neutralize the virus in vitro with or without complement (86,106,110) and can passively protect mice and swine (102).
      <br/>
      The PRV glycoprotein gIII can protect mice and swine from lethal PRV challenge after immunization with a Cro/gIII fusion protein expressed in E. coli (Robbins, A., R. Watson, L. Enquist, European Patent application 0162738A1) or when expressed in a vaccinia recombinant (Panicali, D., L. Gritz, G. Mazzara, European Patent application 0261940A2).

      One of the main constituents of the PRV envelope is a disulfide linked complex of three glycoproteins (120 kDa, 67 kDa and 58 kDa) designated as PRV gpII according to the nomenclature of Hampl (86).
      <br/>
      The DNA sequence encoding PRV gpII is located in the left end of UL.
      <br/>
      The open reading frame of 2976 nucleotides encodes a primary translation product of 913 amino acids or 110 kDa.
      <br/>
      PRV gpII is the HSV-1 gB homolog (62).
      <br/>
      Monoclonal antibodies directed against PRV gpII have been shown to neutralize the virus in vitro (5) with or without complement (81).
      <br/>
      Moreover, passive immunization studies demonstrated that neutralizing monoclonal antibodies partially protected swine but failed to protect mice from virulent virus challenge (102).
      <br/>
      To date, the active immunization of swine with PRV gpII glycoprotein has not been reported.

      During the past 20 years the incidence of genital infections caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) has increased significantly.
      <br/>
      Recent estimates indicate that in the United States, 5-20 million people have genital herpes (112).
      <br/>
      Although oral treatment with acyclovir has been shown to reduce the severity of primary infections (113) and to suppress recurrent episodes (114), the control and treatment of these infections is far from ideal.
      <br/>
      A vaccine to prevent primary and recurrent infections is therefore needed.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) genome encodes at least eight antigenically distinct glycoproteins: gB, gC, gD, gE, gG, gH, gI and gJ (115).
      <br/>
      Homologues for these genes appear to be present in HSV2 (116-119).
      <br/>
      Since these glycoproteins are present in both the virion envelope and the infected cell plasma membrane, they can induce humoral and cell-mediated protective immune responses (37).
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The relative importance of humoral and cellular immunity in protection against herpes simplex virus infections has not been completely elucidated.
      <br/>
      Mice immunized with purified HSV1 gB, gC or gD are protected against lethal HSV1 challenge (120).
      <br/>
      Mice have also been protected against lethal HSV1 or HSV2 challenge by passive immunization with antibodies to total HSV1 (121) or HSV2 (122) virus and with antibodies to the individual HSV2 gB, gC, gD or gE glycoproteins (123).
      <br/>
      This protection, however, appears to be dependent upon a competent T-cell response since animals immunosuppressed by irradiation, cyclophosphamide or anti-thymocyte serum were not protected (124).
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The contribution of the individual glycoproteins in eliciting a protective immune response is not completely understood.
      <br/>
      Expression of these glycoproteins in a heterologous system, such as vaccinia, has allowed some of these parameters to be analyzed.
      <br/>
      For example, vaccinia virus vectors expressing HSV1 gB (125) and HSV1 gC (32) have been shown to induce cytotoxic T-cell responses.
      <br/>
      In addition, it has been shown that mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing either HSV1 gB (8), HSV1 gC (126) or HSV1 gD (26) are protected against a lethal challenge of HSV1.
      <br/>
      A recombinant vaccinia virus expressing HSV1 gD has also been shown to be protective against HSV2 in a guinea pig model system (44).
      <br/>
      It is not known, however, whether expression of multiple HSV antigens will result in a potentiation of this protective response.

      Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) is responsible for a variety of diseases in cattle, including conjunctivitis, vulvovaginitis and abortion (127).

      It is also one of the most important agents of bovine respiratory disease, acting either directly or as a predisposing factor for bacterial infection (128).
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      BHV1 specifies more than 30 structural polypeptides, 11 of which are glycosylated (129).
      <br/>
      Four of these glycoproteins, gI, gII, gIII and gIV, have been characterized and found to be homologous to the herpes simplex virus (HSV) glycoproteins gB, gC, gD, and gE (130,131).
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Subunit vaccines consisting of gI, gIII and/or gIV have been shown to protect cattle from disease (using a BHV1/Pasteurella haemolytica aerosol challenge model) but not from infection (132).

      These results indicate the importance of these glycoproteins in eliciting a successful immune response against BHV1.

      Feline rhinotracheitis is a common and worldwide disease of cats which is caused by an alphaherpesvirus designated feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1).
      <br/>
      Like other herpesviruses, FHV-1 establishes a latent infection which results in periodic reactivation (134).
      <br/>
      FHV-1 infections in breeding colonies are characterized by a high rate of mortality in kittens.
      <br/>
      Secondary infections of the upper respiratory tract are quite debilitating in adults.
      <br/>
      The control of this disease is currently attempted by using modified live or inactivated vaccines which can suppress the development of clinical signs but do not prevent infection that results in shedding of virus.
      <br/>
      Thus, asymptomatic vaccinated cats can spread virulent virus and latent infections cannot be prevented by existing vaccines (135) or by the safer purified subunits vaccines under development (136,137).

      Herpesvirus glycoproteins mediate attachment of the virion to the host cell and are extremely important in viral infectivity (138,139).
      <br/>
      They also determine the subtype specificity of the virus (140).
      <br/>
      Herpesvirus glycoproteins antigens are recognized by both the humoral and cellular immune systems and have been shown to evoke protective immune responses in vaccinated hosts (44,107,141,142).
      <br/>
      FHV-1 has been shown to contain at least 23 different proteins (143,144).
      <br/>
      Of these, at least five are glycosylated (144,145) with reported molecular masses ranging from 120 kDa to 60 kDa.
      <br/>
      The FHV-1 glycoproteins have been shown to be immunogenic (143,145).
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Like several other alphaherpesviruses, FHV-1 appears to have a homolog of glycoprotein B (gB) of HSV-1, and partial sequence of the FHV-1 gB gene has recently been reported (146).
      <br/>
      The HSV-1 gB is required for virus entry and for cell fusion (147-149).
      <br/>
      The HSV-1 gB and the gB analogs of other herpesviruses have been shown to elicit important circulating antibody as well as cell-mediated immune responses (8,10,37,47,73,150).
      <br/>
      The FHV-1 gB glycoprotein is a 134 kDa complex which is dissociated with B-mercaptoethanol into two glycoproteins of 66 kDa and 60 kDa.
      <br/>
      The FHV-1 DNA genome is approximately 134 Kb in size (153).

      Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), a human B lymphotropic herpesvirus, is a member of the genus lymphocryptovirus which belongs to the subfamily gammaherpesvirus (115).

      It is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis (154) and of B-cell lymphomas (156).
      <br/>
      EBV is associated with two human malignancies: the endemic Burkitt's lymphoma and the undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (156).
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Since the EBV genome was completely sequenced (207) as the genomes of VZV (66) and HSV1 (158) numerous homologies between these different herpesviruses have been described (159).
      <br/>
      In some cases these homologies have been used to predict the potential functions of some open reading frame (ORFs) of EBV.
      <br/>
      The EBV genes homologous to the HSV1 genes involved in immunity are of particular interest.
      <br/>
      So the EBV BALF4 gene has homologies with HSV1 gB (68) and the EBV BXLF2 gene with HSV1 gH (161).
      <br/>
      Finally, the EBV BBRF3 gene contains homologies with a CMV membrane protein (162).

    <p num="42">
      Among the EBV proteins, the two major envelope glycoproteins gp340 and gp220. are the best characterized potential vaccinating antigens.

      They are derived from the same gene by splicing without a change in the reading frame (163,164).
      <br/>
      Monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal sera directed against gp340 neutralize EBV in vitro (165).
      <br/>
      The cottontop tamarins, the only susceptible animal, can be protected by an immunization with purified gp340 (166) and with a recombinant EBV gp340 vaccinia virus (167).

      In this case, the protection was achieved with a recombinant derived from the WR vaccinia strain but not with a recombinant derived from the Wyeth vaccinia strain.

      Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a member of the betaherpesvirinae subfamily (family Herpesviridae).
      <br/>
      HCMV can produce a persistent productive infection in the face of substantial specific immunity.
      <br/>
      Even if HCMV possesses a low pathogenicity in general, intrauterine infection causes brain damages or deafness in about 0.15% of all newborns and it is the most common infectious complication of organ transplantation (170).
      <br/>
      Although the efficacy of an experimental live attenuated (Towne strain) HCMV vaccine has been demonstrated (171), concerns about live vaccine strains have directed efforts towards the identification of HCMV proteins usable as a subunit vaccine.
      <br/>
      In this prospect the identification of virion glycoproteins and their evaluation as protective agents is an important step.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Three immunologically distinct families of glycoproteins associated with the HCMV envelope have been described (172): gCI (gp55 and gp93-130); gCII (gp47-52); and gCIII (gp85-p145).</p>
    <p num="46">
      The gene coding for gCI is homologous to HSVI gB.
      <br/>
      The gCII glycoproteins are coded by a family of five genes (HXLF) arranged in tandem and sharing one or two regions of homology.
      <br/>
      More probably gCII is coded by only two of these genes (172,173).
      <br/>
      The gene coding for gCIII is homologous to HSVI gH (174).

      Suitably modified poxvirus mutants carrying exogenous equine herpesvirus genes which are expressed in a host as an antigenic determinant eliciting the production by the host of antibodies to herpesvirus antigens represent novel vaccines which avoid the drawbacks of conventional vaccines employing killed or attenuated live organisms.
      <br/>
      Thus, for instance, the production of vaccines from killed organisms requires the growth of large quantities of the organisms followed by a treatment which will selectively destroy their infectivity without affecting their antigenicity.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, vaccines containing attenuated live organisms always present the possibility of a reversion of the attenuated organism to a pathogenic state.
      <br/>
      In contrast, when a recombinant poxvirus suitably modified with an equine herpesvirus gene coding for an antigenic determinant of a disease-producing herpesvirus is used as a vaccine, the possibility of reversion to a pathogenic organism is avoided since the poxvirus contains only the gene coding for the antigenic determinant of the disease-producing organism and not those genetic portions of the organism responsible for the replication of the pathogen.

      PRV fatally infects many mammalian species (cattle, dogs, etc.).
      <br/>
      Adult pigs, however, usually survive infection and therefore represent an important virus reservoir.
      <br/>
      Because PRV causes severe economic losses, vaccination of pigs with attenuated or killed vaccines is performed in many countries.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Attempts to control PRV infection in swine and to reduce economic losses have been made by active immunization with modified live or inactivated vaccines.
      <br/>
      Attenuated vaccines which generally induce long lasting immunity and are cost efficient present the risk of insufficient attenuation or genetic instability.
      <br/>
      Inactivated vaccines are less efficient, require several immunizations and usually contain potent adjuvants.
      <br/>
      These latter formulations can induce post-vaccinal allergic reactions such as lack of appetite, hyperthermia or abortion in pregnant sows.
      <br/>
      These vaccine types also suffer from certain drawbacks with respect to prevention of latent infections, overcoming the effects of maternal antibodies on vaccination efficacy, and eliminating the potential use of a serological diagnostic assay to distinguish vaccinated animals from those previously infected with PRV.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Alternative vaccination strategies such as the use of recombinant poxviruses that express immunologically pertinent PRV gene products would have certain advantages: (a) eliminate live attenuated PRV vaccine strains from the field; and (b) allow the distinction of vaccinated versus infected or seropositive animals.
      <br/>
      The latter could be accomplished by the use of appropriate diagnostic reagents that would precisely distinguish vaccinated from naturally infected animals.
      <br/>
      This is an important consideration because of existing regulations controlling the movement of seropositive animals.
      <br/>
      Further, vaccination is more economical and preferable to testing and eliminating infected animals from the lots.
      <br/>
      The development of such vaccines requires a knowledge of the contributions made by appropriate PRV antigens to the induction of protective immunity.
      <br/>
      In the case of PRV, as with other members of the herpesvirus family, the glycoproteins are important candidates for antigens to be present in an effective subunit recombinant vaccine.

      The technology of generating vaccinia virus recombinants has recently been extended to other members of the poxvirus family which have a more restricted host range.
      <br/>
      In particular, avipoxviruses, which replicate in avian species, have been engineered to express immunologically pertinent gene products.
      <br/>
      Inoculation of avian (42,177) and non-avian species (41) with avipoxvirus recombinants elicited protective immune responses against the corresponding pathogen.

      Attenuated live vaccines and inactivated vaccines to BHV1 have been available for over 30 years and have successfully reduced the incidence of BHV1 related diseases.
      <br/>
      These vaccines, however, do not prevent latent infection or reinfection with wildtype virus.
      <br/>
      They also complicate the differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Both types of vaccines have other significant drawbacks.
      <br/>
      Vaccination of pregnant cows with attenuated live vaccines can cause fetal death and subsequent abortion (127).
      <br/>
      In addition, vaccinated animals have been shown to shed virus (178).
      <br/>
      Therefore, vaccinated animals kept with pregnant cows can spread infectious virus to the pregnant animal and cause abortion of the fetus.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Inactivated vaccines do not induce abortions or provoke viral excretion.
      <br/>
      However, they necessitate the use of adjuvants and can cause fatal hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis) and nonfatal inflammation and fever (179).
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      One of the more important issues in vaccination is overcoming or avoiding maternal immunity.
      <br/>
      In this respect, if a mother is immune to a particular pathogen, the "immunity" in the mother will be passed on to the newborn via the antibodies present in the colostrum and/or by additional pathways.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the newborn cannot be successfully vaccinated until the level of maternal immunity has waned sufficiently.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a narrow window where the newborn can be successfully vaccinated in the presence of waning maternal immunity.
    </p>
    <p num="57">It can thus be appreciated that provision of a herpesvirus recombinant poxvirus, and of vaccines which provide protective immunity against herpesvirus infections, which confer on the art the advantages of live virus inoculation but which reduce or eliminate the previously discussed problems would be a highly desirable advance over the current state of technology.</p>

    <p num="61">These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent after consideration of the following.</p>
    <heading>STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="62">
      In one aspect, the present invention relates to a recombinant poxvirus containing therein a DNA sequence from herpesvirus in a nonessential region of the poxvirus genome.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, the herpesvirus is a member of the alphaherpesvirus, betaherpesvirus or gammaherpesvirus subfamily.
      <br/>
      In particular, the DNA sequence from herpesvirus codes for a herpesvirus glycoprotein.
      <br/>
      More in particular, the herpesvirus glycoprotein is selected from the group consisting of equine herpesvirus gp13, equine herpesvirus gp14, equine herpesvirus gD, equine herpesvirus gp63, equine herpesvirus gE, pseudorabies virus gp 50, pseudorabies virus gpII, pseudorabies virus gpIII, pseudorabies virus gpI, herpes simplex virus gB, herpes simplex virus gC, herpes simplex virus gD, bovine herpes virus gI, feline herpes virus gB, Epstein-Barr virus gp220, Epstein-Barr virus gp340, Epstein-Barr virus gB, Epstein-Barr virus gH and human cytomegalovirus gB.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      According to the present invention, the recombinant poxvirus expresses gene products of the foreign herpesvirus gene.
      <br/>
      In particular, the foreign DNA sequence codes for a herpesvirus glycoprotein and the foreign DNA is expressed in a host by the production of the herpesvirus glycoprotein.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, a plurality of herpesvirus glycoproteins are coexpressed in the host by the recombinant poxvirus.
      <br/>
      The poxvirus is advantageously a vaccinia virus or an avipox virus, such as fowlpox virus or canarypox virus.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      In another aspect, the present invention relates to a vaccine for inducing an immunological response in a host animal inoculated with the vaccine, said vaccine including a carrier and a recombinant poxvirus containing, in a nonessential region thereof, DNA from herpesvirus.
      <br/>
      More in particular, the DNA codes for and expresses a herpesvirus glycoprotein.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, a plurality of herpesvirus glycoproteins are coexpressed in the host by the poxvirus.
      <br/>
      The poxvirus used in the vaccine according to the present invention is advantageously a vaccinia virus or an avipox virus, such as fowlpox virus or canarypox virus.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      In another aspect, the present invention relates to mechanisms to bypass the issue of maternal immunity.
      <br/>
      If the barrier is due to the presence of antibodies to a given antigen(s) then the barrier of maternal immunity may be overcome or avoided by using, selectively, vectors expressing defined subsets of antigens.
      <br/>
      For example, the pregnant animal can be vaccinated with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing pseudorabies virus glycoprotein gp50 and the offspring can be vaccinated at birth or shortly thereafter with vaccinia recombinants expressing other pseudorabies virus glycoproteins gpII or gpIII or combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the barrier presented by maternal immunity is due to the vector then one may differentially vaccinate the mother with one vector (vaccinia or avipox) and vaccinate the offspring with the other vector.
      <br/>
      This procedure, of course, takes into consideration not only the use of different vectors but also vectors expressing a different constellation of glycoproteins.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention relates to a method for overcoming or avoiding maternal immunity which would otherwise prevent successful immunization in a newborn offspring.
      <br/>
      By the present invention, the newborn offspring is inoculated with a recombinant poxvirus containing therein DNA from a non-pox source in a nonessential region of the poxvirus genome, said DNA coding for a first antigen of a pathogen of the newborn offspring, and said antigen being different from a second antigen of the same pathogen used to induce an immunological response to the same pathogen in the mother of the newborn offspring.
      <br/>
      Also by the present invention, the newborn offspring is inoculated with a recombinant first poxvirus containing therein DNA from a non-pox source in a nonessential region of the first poxvirus genome, said DNA coding for an antigen of a pathogen of the newborn offspring, and said first poxvirus being different from a recombinant second poxvirus used to induce an immunological response to the same pathogen in the mother of the newborn offspring.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="67">A better understanding of the present invention and of its many advantages will be had from the following examples, given by way of illustration.</p>
    <p num="68">Example 1</p>
    <p num="69">Construction of Vaccinia Virus Recombinants Expressing the Equine Herpesvirus gp13 Glycoprotein</p>
    <p num="70">Replacement of the HA gene of vaccinia with the E. coli Beta-galactosidase gene.</p>
    <p num="71">
      The Copenhagen strain of vaccinia virus obtained from Rhone Merieux, Inc. (Athens, Ga.) was utilized in this example.
      <br/>
      The virus was propagated from a purified plaque isolate on either VERO (ATCC- CCL81) or MRC-5 (ATCC- CCL171) cells in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
      <br/>
      A derivative of the wildtype virus from which the entire coding sequence for the thymidine kinase gene was deleted by standard methods (25,28) was isolated and designated vP410.
      <br/>
      This thymidine kinase deletion mutant was used for further manipulations.
      <br/>
      Plasmids were constructed, screened, and grown by standard procedures (20,27,28).
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Referring now to FIG. 1, the 13 Kb SalI F fragment of vaccinia virus which spans the HindIII A/B fragment junction was ligated into SalI digested pUC8 generating pSD419VC.
      <br/>
      The right arm of pSD419VC corresponding to the HindIII B portion of the SalI F fragment was removed by digestion with HindIII and religation generating pSD456VC. pSD456VC thus contains the right end of the HindIII A fragment within which is the complete coding region for the hemagglutinin (HA) gene (35) flanked by approximately 0.4 Kb additional vaccinia sequences on each side.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      To generate a plasmid vector virtually devoid of HA coding sequences, pSD456VC was cut (partial digest) at the RsaI site upstream of the HA gene and at the EagI site 80 bp from the 3' end of the HA gene.
      <br/>
      The approximate 3.5 Kb RsaI/EagI fragment was isolated from an agarose gel.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Synthetic oligonucleotides MPSYN59-62 were prepared to replace the region from the RsaI site through position 2 upstream of the HA coding sequence, immediately followed by BglII, SmaI and PstI restriction sites and an EagI sticky end.
      <br/>
      The sequence of MPSYN59-62, with restriction sites as indicated, is as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      -- 5'-ACACGAATGATTTTCTAAAGTATTTGGAAAGTTTTATAGGTAGTTGATAGAACAA

      <br/>
      --                                  BglII SmaI  PstI  EagI
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The annealed MPSYN59-62 mixture was ligated into the 3.5 Kb RsaI/EagI fragment from pSD456VC, generating pSD466VC.
      <br/>
      Thus, in pSD466VC the HA gene has been replaced by a polylinker region.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      A 3.2 Kb BglII/BamHI (partial) fragment containing the E. coli Beta-galactosidase gene from pMC1871 (34) under the transcriptional control of the vaccinia 11 kDa promoter (7) was cloned into pSD466VC which had been digested with BglII.
      <br/>
      A plasmid containing the 11 kDa promoter/Beta-galactosidase gene cassette in a left to right orientation relative to flanking vaccinia arms was designated pSD466VCBGA and recombined into a thymidine kinase deletion mutant, vP410, of the Copenhagen strain of vaccinia virus generating the vaccinia recombinant vP425 expressing Beta-galactosidase.
      <br/>
      Eighty base pairs at the carboxy terminus of the HA gene were retained so not to disrupt a short potential open reading frame transcribed right to left relative to the vaccinia genome.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      The recombinant vaccinia virus, vP425 (184), was identified on the basis of blue plaque formation in the presence of the chromogenic substrate, X-gal, as described by others (9,24).
      <br/>
      Substitution of the Beta-galactosidase gene by yet another foreign gene in subsequent vaccinia recombinants could be readily scored by isolating colorless plaques instead of blue plaques.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      To facilitate future cloning steps, the SmaI site derived from the pUC8 multicloning region was eliminated by digestion of pSD466VC with BamHI/EcoRI, blunt ending with the Klenow fragment of E. coli polymerase, and religation.
      <br/>
      Thus, the single SmaI site remaining in the resulting plasmid, pSD467VC, is in the polylinker region of the HA deletion.
    </p>
    <p num="80">Identification of DNA sequences encoding EHV-1 gp13 gene.</p>
    <p num="81">
      The DNA sequence encoding the glycoprotein EHV-1 gp13 resides in the 7.3 Kb BamHI-H fragment of EHV-1 (3).
      <br/>
      Nucleotide sequence data for both-strands was obtained from the pUC (BamHI-H) region utilizing overlapping subclones using the modified T7 enzyme SEQUENASE (40) (U.S. Biochemicals, Cleveland, Ohio).
      <br/>
      Standard dideoxy chain-termination reactions (33) were performed on double stranded plasmid templates that had been denatured in alkali.
      <br/>
      The M13 forward and reverse primers were used to obtain the initial sequence of each clone.
      <br/>
      Custom 16-17-mer primers, synthesized using standard chemistries (Biosearch 8700, San Rafael, Calif.; Applied Biosystems 380B, Foster City, Calif.), were used to walk along the remaining fragment.
      <br/>
      The IBI Pustell sequence analysis program was used in all sequence data analysis (29).
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      DNA sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,404 bp encoding 468 amino acids with a predicted primary translation product of 50.9 kDa. Significant amino acid homology in the carboxy half of the putative gp13 open reading frame was observed to gC of herpes simplex viruses type 1 and type 2, gIII of pseudorabies virus, and gpV of varicella-zoster virus suggesting that gp13 was a member of the gC like glycoproteins of herpesviruses.
      <br/>
      Further detailed analysis of the EHV-1 gp13 open reading frame was presented in a previous publication (2).
      <br/>
      To facilitate the description of the cloning and expression of the EHV-1 gp13 in vaccinia virus vectors, the gp13 open reading frame plus additional 5' and 3' sequences are shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, a presumptive TATA box and amino acids comprising putative signals and membrane anchor elements are underlined.
      <br/>
      The potential cleavage site of the signal sequence is noted with an arrow following the cleavage signal ASA (open circles).
      <br/>
      Potentially, nine N-linked glycosylation sites exist within the signal and anchor sequences as defined by the Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif (asterisks).

    <p num="83">Cloning of the EHB-1 gp13 gene into a vaccinia virus donor plasmid.</p>
    <p num="84">
      An early/late vaccinia virus promoter, H6, has been used for the expression of foreign genes in fowlpox virus vectors (41,42).
      <br/>
      This promoter element corresponds to the DNA sequences immediately upstream of the H6 open reading frame in vaccinia HindIII-H fragment (31).
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      Referring now to FIG. 3, to mutate and insert the H6 promoter into pSD467VC, oligonucleotides H6SYN oligos A-D were synthesized.
      <br/>
      The sequence of H6SYN oligos A-D, with modified base as underlined and restriction sites as indicated, is as follows:

    </p>
    <p num="87">The underlined bases denote modification from the native H6 promoter sequence.</p>
    <p num="88">
      The 130 bp full length, double stranded DNA formed by the annealing of H6SYN oligos A-D was purified by electroelution from an agarose gel and ligated to 0.5 Kb SmaI/HindIII and 3.1 Kb BglII/HindIII fragments derived from pSD467VC.
      <br/>
      The resulting plasmid, pTP15 (184), has the ATG initiation codon modified to CCC as part of the SmaI site which is immediately followed by a PstI site.
      <br/>
      An NsiI linker, 5'-TGCATGCATGCA-3', (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) was inserted into the SmaI site of pTP15 to generate the plasmid pNSI.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      An EHV-1 EcoRI/NarI fragment in which the EcoRI site is 120 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon and where the NarI site is 23 bp upstream from the TAG termination codon of EHV-1 gp13 was cloned into phage M13mp19 generating the recombinant phage M13EcoRNar.
      <br/>
      Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (17) an NsiI site was introduced by changing the sequence TTGCCT (bases 130-135 in FIG. 2) in the EHV-1 gp13 gene to ATGCAT.
      <br/>
      The EcoRI/NarI fragment from mutant phage M13EcoRNar was cloned into pUC8 at EcoRI/NarI sites generating plasmid pNSIEN.

    <p num="90">Two 42-mer oligonucleotides were synthesized having the sequence, with restriction sites as indicated, as follows:</p>

      In this oligonucleotide, the termination codon (TAG) is immediately followed by a vaccinia early transcription terminator (ATTTTTAT).

      This vector fragment was blunt ended with Mung Bean nuclease.

      Procedures for transfection of recombinant donor plasmids into tissue culture cells infected with a rescuing vaccinia virus and identification of recombinants by in situ hybridization on nitrocellulose filters were as previously described (25,28).
      <br/>
      To construct vP425 where the E. coli Beta-galactosidase gene replaces the vaccinia HA coding sequences, plasmid DNA (25 ug of pSD466VCBGA in HeBS (16)) was electroporated (BioRad Gene Pulser, capacitance 960, 200 volts) into VERO cells.
      <br/>
      Subconfluent monolayers of cells were infected at 10 pfu/cell with vP410 one hour prior to use.

      The infected cells were harvested with trypsin and washed with HeBS before electroporation.

      To generate recombinant vaccinia virus where the EHV-1 gp13 gene replaced the Beta-galactosidase gene in vP425, a similar protocol was followed except that the donor plasmid was pVHA6g13 and rescuing virus was vP425.
      <br/>
      The vaccinia recombinant vP483, containing EHV-1 gp13 was detected as a colorless plaque in the presence of X-gal and confirmed as a true recombinant by DNA hybridization after 3 cycles of plaque purification.

      At 20 hours post infection the coverslips were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2% BSA and 0.1% NaN3 (PBS+) and exposed to 0.1 ml of anti-gp13 monoclonal antibody, 14H7 (3) diluted one to a thousand in PBS+. After 1 hour in a humidified chamber at room temperature the cells were washed 3 times in PBS+. This procedure was repeated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG.

      Finally, the cells were fixed for 20 minutes in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS.

      The protein predicted from the DNA sequence has the typical features characteristic of a membrane spanning glycoprotein (14).

      In a productive EHV-1 infection that gp13 glycoprotein is incorporated into the various membrane systems of the cell and is transported into the cytoplasmic membrane and detectable on the external surface of the infected cell.
      <br/>
      EHV-1 gp13 is additionally a component of the EHV-1 virion.
      <br/>
      Therefore, immunofluorescence studies were performed to determine whether EHV-1 gp13 expressed by the vaccinia virus recombinant, vP483, was similarly presented on the cytoplasmic membrane of infected cells.
      <br/>
      Anti-gp13 specific monoclonal antibody followed by fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG revealed a strong membrane immunofluorescence in vP483 infected cells but not in vaccinia virus vP410 infected cells.

      This suggests that the EHV-1 gp13 expressed by the recombinant vaccinia virus vP483 is presented on the cytoplasmic membrane as expected for authentic synthesis of a membrane spanning glycoprotein.

      Referring now to FIG. 4, an open reading frame reading right to left relative to the vaccinia genome and encoding a putative protein of 220 amino acids is located entirely within the HindIII M fragment from the Copenhagen strain of vaccinia virus to the left of the unique BglII site.
      <br/>
      According to convention (31), this gene, which is located immediately to the right of MNL (58), was designated M2L.
      <br/>
      Deletion studies directed to the vaccinia (WR) genome extending leftward from the unique BglII site in HindIII fragment M (57) indicate that vaccinia coding sequences contained in HindIII M to the left of the BglII site are not essential for replication of the virus in tissue culture.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      To facilitate use of the M2L region as an insertion locus for foreign genes, a plasmid vector, pMP409DVC, was created in which the entire M2L coding sequence was replaced by a BglII site as follows. pSD409VC, which consists of the Copenhagen vaccinia HindIII M fragment cloned into the HindIII site of pUC8, was digested with BamHI/BalI and self-ligated, thus removing the right end of HindIII M and destroying the BglII site.
      <br/>
      The resulting plasmid, pMP409BVC, was linearized with SphI, which cuts within the M2L open reading frame, and was subjected to Bal-31 exonuclease digestion for two minutes.
      <br/>
      Mutagenesis was performed on the resulting DNA (19) using a synthetic 49 mer (5'-TTTCTGTATATTTGCAACAATTTAGATCTTACTCAAAATATGTAACAAT-3'; BglII site underlined).
      <br/>
      In the mutagenized plasmid, pMP409DVC, the M2L coding sequences have been deleted from position +3 through the end of the open reading frame.
      <br/>
      The G of the initiation codon ATG was changed to a C to create a unique BglII site (AGATCT) at the deletion junction.

      <br/>
      A recombinant plasmid containing the 11 kDa promoter/Beta-galactosidase gene cassette in a right to left orientation relative to flanking vaccinia arms and genome was designated pMP409DVCBG. pMP409DVCBG was used as donor plasmid for recombination with rescuing vaccinia virus, vP410, described in Example 1.
      <br/>
      The novel vaccinia recombinant, designated vP458, expressing the Beta-galactosidase gene inserted into the M2L deletion locus was detected using the chromogenic X-gal substrate (9,24) and purified by repeated plaque cloning.

      Referring now to FIG. 5, the EHV-1 gp14 coding sequence spans the junction between the BamHI restriction fragments a and i (3).
      <br/>
      The EHV-1 DNA fragments BamHI-a (21.3 Kb) and i (7.1 Kb) (59) were isolated from agarose gels.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pUC (BamHI-i) was constructed by inserting the EHV-1 BamHI-i fragment into plasmid pUC8 at the BamHI site.
      <br/>
      The EHV-1 BamHI-a fragment was digested with EcoRI and ligated into EcoRI/BamHI digested pUC8.

      Plasmid pUC (BamHI-a/EcoRI) contains a 10 Kb EHV-1 BamHI/EcoRI insert.

      <br/>
      The orientation of the pUC (BamHI-i) plasmid was determined by restriction enzyme digestion.
      <br/>
      Since the EHV-1 BamHI terminus closest to the EcoRI site in pUC (BamHI-i) was found to be the BamHI site at the BamHI-a/i junction, sequencing of the fragment was initiated from this BamHI end.

    <p num="121">
      The EHV-1 gp14 open reading frame encodes 980 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 109.8 kDa. Analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed a number of features common to membrane-associated glycoproteins.
      <br/>
      A region extending from amino acids 58 to 99 had a characteristic hydrophobicity profile and is proposed to be the signal sequence (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      An unusual feature of the EHV-1 gp14 gene product is that the long hydrophobic signal sequence is preceded by a long hydrophilic sequence.
      <br/>
      This characteristic has also been noted for the pseudorabies virus (PRV) gII (62) and for the bovine herpesvirus I (BHV-1) gI gene (63), both of which are also HSV gB homologs.
      <br/>
      A hydrophobic region consisting of 45 amino acids (amino acids 826 to 870) is predicted to function as a transmembrane anchor domain.

      Points below the horizontal line represent areas of higher hydrophobicity, therefore indicating potential signal and/or membrane spanning regions.

      A lambda gt11 recombinant, 4a1, was shown to express an EHV-1 gp14 epitope recognized by the specific monoclonal antibody 3F6 (3).
      <br/>
      In order to determine the identity of this epitope, the EHV-1 DNA contained within 4a1 was sequenced and compared with the DNA sequence of the EHV-1 gp14 coding sequence (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      To sequence the DNA fragment corresponding to the EHV-1 gp14 epitope in the lambda gt11 recombinant 4a1 recognized by anti-EHV-1 gp14 monoclonal 3F6 (3), 4a1 was digested with EcoRI, the EHV-1 fragment isolated on agarose gels and ligated into the EcoRI site of pUC8.

      DNA sequencing was performed as described above with the M13 universal forward and reverse primers.

      The nucleotide sequence alignment indicated that this epitope was contained within the 66 amino acid region corresponding to 107 (Thr) through 172 (Val) of the deduced primary translation product.

      In order to determine the protective efficacy of a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing EHV-1 gp14 alone or in combination with EHV-1 gp13, challenge studies were performed on vaccinated hamsters.
      <br/>
      Twenty one-day-old syrian hamsters weighing approximately 60 g each were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 ml of control vaccinia virus or with recombinant vaccinia viruses vP483, vP577, vP613, vP633 and vP634 expressing EHV-1 gp13 and/or gp14.
      <br/>
      Primary vaccination was followed by an identical vaccinating dose (pfu/ml (log10)) on day 14.
      <br/>
      All hamsters, including non-inoculated controls, were challenged 14 days after the last immunization with an intraperitoneal injection of 200 LD50 of EHV-1 hamster adapted Kentucky strain.
      <br/>
      Survivors from groups of five were calculated 14 days post-challenge at which point the experiment was terminated.
      <br/>
      The dose of inoculum giving 50% protection of the hamsters is evaluated as log10 TCID50 /ml inoculant.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      As shown in Table 4, the vaccinia virus recombinant, vP577, expressing the full length EHV-1 gp14 gene failed to protect hamsters against challenge with a PD50 calculated  &gt;= 9.0 log10. On the other hand, the truncated EHV-1 gp14 gene as expressed by the vaccinia recombinant, vP613, gave good protection on challenge (Table 4).
      <br/>
      The calculated PD50 is somewhat better (5.2) than that obtained with the EHV-1 gp13 expressing vaccinia recombinant, vP483 (6.1).
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, the coexpression of EHV-1 gp13 and gp14, whether the full length gp14 gene or the truncated gp14 gene in vaccinia virus recombinants vP633 and vP634, respectively, gave significantly enhanced protective efficacy compared with efficacy for the EHV-1 glycoproteins expressed singly.
      <br/>
      Hence, the amount of virus inoculum to achieve a 50% protection of the vaccinated hamsters was significantly decreased when EHV-1 gp13 and gp14 were coexpressed in the same vaccinia virus recombinant.

      To remove excess EHV-1 DNA, pMP14M-63 was subjected to partial DraI digestion followed by isolation of linear DNA from an agarose gel, and digestion with PstI which cuts at the junction of EHV-1 DNA and the downstream vaccinia flanking arm.

      In order to assess the relative immunogenicity of the three PRV glycoproteins expressed by vaccinia virus recombinants, mice were inoculated in the footpad with 50 to 100 ul of different doses of the recombinant viruses.
      <br/>
      Fourteen days after the immunization the mice were challenged with 10 LD50 of the virulent Kojnock strain of PRV by the intraperitoneal route.
      <br/>
      In preliminary experiments each of the PRV glycoproteins were shown to be efficacious in protecting inoculated mice against a virulent PRV challenge.
      <br/>
      In a more extended series of experiments utilizing over 500 mice, the efficacy of vaccinia recombinants expressing PRV glycoproteins was assessed.
      <br/>
      The vaccination dose able to protect 50% of the challenged mice (PD5) was calculated and the results of these studies are shown in Table 8.
      <br/>
      Recombinant vaccinia virus expressing individually PRV glycoproteins gpII, gp50 and gpIII generate calculated PD50 values of 6.4, 5.4 and 5.8 (log10), respectively.
      <br/>
      When the glycoproteins are expressed in combination significantly better PD50 values are calculated.
      <br/>
      The vaccinia recombinant expressing PRV gpII plus gp50 generated a PD50 value of 3.3, whereas the vaccinia recombinant expressing PRV gp50 plus gpIII results in an essentially similar PD50 value (3.6).

      Apparently more efficacious is the recombinant expressing PRV glycoproteins gpII plus gpIII where a PD50 of 1.5 is obtained.

      Coexpression of all three PRV glycoproteins gpII, gpIII and gp50 in a recombinant vaccinia virus does not provide a PD50 value significantly lower than those obtained with the recombinant viruses expressing the three PRV glycoproteins individually.

      The potentiated efficacy obtained with the vaccinia recombinant expressing gpII and gpIII compared to vaccinia recombinant virus expressing the genes individually is similar to the results reported in Example 6 for the coexpression of equine herpesvirus glycoproteins gp13 and gp14.

      Although the mouse can provide an interesting model system for evaluation of PRV glycoprotein immunogenicity, the major target species of a PRV vaccine is swine.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in order to assess the validity of the recombinant vaccinia virus approach in swine the following experiment was performed.
      <br/>
      Piglets of approximately 25 kg were inoculated intramuscularly with 2 ml of the vaccinia recombinants expressing combinations of the PRV glycoproteins gpII, gpIII and gp50.
      <br/>
      Virus inoculum was diluted in PBS.
      <br/>
      Thirty five days after this inoculation, the piglets were challenged by an intranasal injection (1 ml into each nostril) of a virulent PRV isolate NIA3 suspension.
      <br/>
      The effectiveness of vaccination was evaluated by measuring comparative weight gain of vaccinated and control piglets for seven days after challenge.
      <br/>
      Relative weight gain is calculated as the daily mean percentage weight gain observed in vaccinated pigs minus the daily mean percentage weight gain of unvaccinated control pigs.
      <br/>
      Normal weight gain of pigs in unperturbed conditions is greater than 1.1 kg. As demonstrated by the data in Table 9, weight evolution during the seven day period after PRV challenge is greatly enhanced in the vaccinated piglets over the wildtype virus inoculated control set.
      <br/>
      A single inoculation with the vaccinia virus recombinants gives significant protection against weight loss after virulent PRV challenge.

      The availability of vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the three dominant PRV glycoproteins individually or in combination offer a number of advantages to the control of PRV infections in the field: (a) one significant advantage is that the recombinant vaccinia viruses as vaccinating agents express only a limited number of PRV genes and, therefore, there is no attendant risk of reversion of an attenuated PRV vaccine strain to a virulent form and, therefore, there is no continued introduction of PRV virus into the environment; (b) since only a limited number of PRV antigens are expressed by the vaccinia virus recombinant PRV vaccine candidates, this allows the discrimination of vaccinated versus naturally infected animals since diagnostic reagents consisting of other PRV antigens could be assembled to discriminate between vaccinated and naturally infected animals; and (c) such recombinant vaccines could be useful in disrupting the natural vertical transmission of PRV from sow to offspring.
      <br/>
      This could be accomplished by the vaccination of the pregnant sow by a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing a discrete set of PRV glycoproteins.
      <br/>
      Maternal immunity should protect the offspring from PRV infection.
      <br/>
      In turn, the offspring then could be vaccinated with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing yet a different configuration of PRV antigens distinct from those used to vaccinate the sow.
      <br/>
      This is one potential way to break through maternal immunity.
      <br/>
      Another approach to address the issue of maternal immunity would be to express the PRV glycoproteins in whatever combination in a completely heterologous vector.
      <br/>
      This is achieved by the construction of avipox virus recombinants expressing PRV glycoproteins.
      <br/>
      The utility of avipox virus recombinants whose natural host range is restricted to avian species, in the vaccination of non-avian species has been demonstrated (41).
      <br/>
      Thus, two approaches are available for addressing the issue of the barrier provided by maternal immunity: (1) the vectors and (2) the constellation of the antigens expressed by those vectors.

      The efficacy of vCP55 as an immunizing agent against live PRV challenge was also evaluated in the target species, the piglet.
      <br/>
      Fifteen piglets weighing nearly 25 kg were separated into three groups.
      <br/>
      The vCP55 group and the CP parental virus group each received two inoculations (2 ml equaling 2 * 108 TCID50) on days 0 and 28 by the intramuscular route.

      <br/>
      Efficacy was monitored by comparing the weight evolution of vCP55 vaccinated and control pigs during the seven days post challenge.
      <br/>
      Weight evolution is calculated as Delta GMQR Values (in kilograms)=mean GMQR % vaccinated piglets-mean GMQR % unvaccinated piglets.

      Significant levels of protection for piglets inoculated with vCP55 expressing the PRVgpII glycoprotein against live PRV challenge was observed (Table 11). vCP55 vaccinated animals had a significant net weight gain over the experimental period, whereas the two control groups had a significant weight loss over the period following PRV challenge.
      <br/>
      Additionally, no deaths were observed in the vCP55 vaccinated group, while an 80% to 100% mortality rate was noted in the control groups following live PRV challenge.
