    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a thin film forming technology used in fabrication of a semiconductor device and, more particularly, to a process of forming a solid thin film from a layer of liquid material and a film forming apparatus used therein.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      A circuit component of a semiconductor integrated circuit device had been miniaturized, and the cross section of each component layer before the miniaturization was similar to the cross section of a corresponding layer after the miniaturization.
      <br/>
      If a manufacture reduces the width and the height of a conductive layer at a certain ratio, the current density is drastically increased, and the large current density damages the conductive layer.
      <br/>
      In order to improve the durability of the conductive layer, the manufacture reduces the width at a large reduction ratio and the height at a small reduction ratio, and such anisotropic reduction increases the circuit components without sacrifice of the durability.
      <br/>
      However, the anisotropic reduction enlarges the aspect ratio of a contact hole formed in the conductive layer, and the contact hole is imperfectly plugged with conductive material.
      <br/>
      Various planarization technologies have been proposed for improving step coverage.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      One of the prior art planarization technologies is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication of Unexamined Application No. 4-99030, and the prior art process is illustrated in FIGS. 1A to 1D. A silicon substrate 1 is overlain by an insulating layer 2, and a first-level aluminum wiring 3 is patterned on the insulating layer 2.
      <br/>
      The first-level aluminum wiring 3 and the exposed area of the insulating layer 2 are covered with an inter-level insulating layer 4, and a contact hole 4a is formed in the inter-level insulating layer 4 in such a manner as to expose the first-level aluminum wiring 3 thereto as shown in FIG. 1A.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Subsequently, metal is deposited over the entire surface of the resultant semiconductor structure shown in FIG. 1A, and forms a metal layer 5.
      <br/>
      The metal can not achieve good step coverage, and a recess 5a takes place in the metal layer 5 as shown in FIG. 1B.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Subsequently, metal-containing liquid is prepared.
      <br/>
      Powder of chromium and tin is mixed into volatile solvent in methyl system or isopropyl system.
      <br/>
      The metal-containing liquid is dropped onto the metal layer 5 in the atmospheric ambience, and the metal-containing liquid is spread over the metal layer 5.
      <br/>
      The volatile solvent is removed at 300 degrees to 400 degrees in centigrade, and the metal powder forms a low fusing point metal layer 6.
      <br/>
      The low fusing point metal layer 6 buries the recess 5a, and creates a smooth top surface 6a as shown in FIG. 1C.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The low fusing point metal layer 6 is uniformly etched away without an etching mask, and the metal layer 5 is exposed, again.
      <br/>
      A piece 6b of low fusing point metal is left in the recess 5a, and the metal layer 5 is patterned into a second-level metal wiring 5b as shown in FIG. 1D.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Another prior art planarization technology is disclosed by Y. Shacham-Diamand et al in "ULSI Application of Spin-On Titanium-Nitride", Advanced Metallization for ULSI Applications, Oct. 28-30, 1991, pages 43 to 45, and FIGS. 2A to 2C illustrate the prior art smoothening technology disclosed therein.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Firstly, a silicon substrate 10 is prepared, and the major surface of the silicon substrate 10 is covered with an insulating layer 11.
      <br/>
      The insulating layer 11 is partially removed, and a hole 11a is formed in the insulating layer 11.
      <br/>
      The silicon substrate 10 is exposed to the hole 11a as shown in FIG. 2A.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Subsequently, colloidal liquid 12a is dropped onto the resultant structure in the atmospheric ambience, and is spread over the entire surface as shown in FIG. 2B. The colloidal liquid 12a is treated with heat at 450 degrees in centigrade in vacuum, hydrogen ambience or NH3.
      <br/>
      Then, a titanium nitride layer 12b is produced from the colloidal liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="11">A problem is encountered in the prior art processes in that a void takes place in the hole 5a/11a.</p>
    <p num="12">Another problem is high resistivity of the order of hundreds micro-ohm cm which is two figures larger than the resistivity of aluminum.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide a process of forming a thin film without a void left in a recess.</p>
    <p num="14">It is also an important object of the present invention to provide a firm forming apparatus used in the process for forming a thin film without a void in a recess.</p>
    <p num="15">To accomplish the object, the present invention proposes to force a layer of liquid material into a recess or hole.</p>
    <p num="16">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process of forming a solid thin film, comprising the steps of: preparing a substrate structure having at least one recess open to a surface of the substrate structure; changing the temperature of the substrate structure to be lower than an ambient temperature; creating vacuum around the substrate structure; supplying liquid material onto the surface of the substrate structure so as to form a layer of liquid material on the surface; pressing the layer of liquid material so as to perfectly fill the recess with the liquid material; and heating the liquid material so as to form a solid layer from the liquid layer.</p>
    <p num="17">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a firm forming apparatus comprising a vessel defining a chamber, a holder provided in the chamber for supporting a substrate structure having a recess open to a surface of the substrate structure, a temperature controller for controlling a temperature of the substrate structure to be lower than a temperature in the chamber, a liquid material feeder supplying liquid material onto the surface for covering the surface with a layer of liquid material, a pressurizer exerting force on the layer of liquid material, and a heater heating the layer of liquid material for forming a solid layer from the layer of liquid material.</p>

      The process starts with preparation of a silicon wafer 31, and silicon oxide is deposited over the silicon wafer 31 so as to cover the silicon wafer 31 with a silicon oxide layer 32.
      <br/>
      Photo-resist solution is spun onto the silicon oxide layer 32, and is baked so as to form a photo-resist layer.

      A pattern image for contact holes is optically transferred from a reticle (not shown) to the photo-resist layer, and a latent image is formed in the photo-resist layer.
      <br/>
      The latent image is developed, and a photo-resist etching mask is formed on the silicon oxide layer 32.
      <br/>
      Predetermined areas are exposed to hollow spaces of the photo-resist etching mask.
      <br/>
      Using the photo-resist etching mask, the silicon oxide layer 32 is selectively etched away, and contact holes are formed in the silicon oxide layer 32.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5A shows one of the contact holes 32a, and description is hereinbelow focused on the contact hole 32a.
      <br/>
      A contact area of the silicon wafer 31 is exposed to the contact hole 32a.
      <br/>
      Although the silicon oxide layer 32 is laminated on the silicon wafer 31, the laminated structure is simply referred to as "semiconductor wafer 25".
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Subsequently, the semiconductor wafer 25 is inserted into the chamber 21a, and is placed on the seal ring 21n.
      <br/>
      The valves 21o and 21p are closed, and the valve 21q is opened.
      <br/>
      The exhauster 23b is actuated, and vacuum is developed in the chamber 21a.
      <br/>
      When the vacuum reaches a predetermined value, the valve 21q is closed.
      <br/>
      The coil heater 21e is energized so as to heat the chamber 21a, and the chamber 21a is maintained to be higher in temperature than the semiconductor wafer 25 by +20 degrees to +50 degrees in centigrade but not higher than the decomposition temperature of the liquid material.
      <br/>
      The cooling gas passes through the small chamber 21d, and the semiconductor wafer 25 is cooled at -70 degrees in centigrade to room temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="35">It is possible to take one of the following temperature control procedures:</p>
    <p num="36">
      1) Only the semiconductor wafer 25 is cooled;

      5) Both of the semiconductor wafer 25 and the chamber 21a are cooled to different temperatures.
    </p>
    <p num="37">However, the third procedure is the most appropriate, because a wide temperature difference is produced between the semiconductor wafer 25 and the chamber 21a.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Subsequently, the valve 21o is opened, and the liquid material is supplied onto the silicon oxide layer 32.
      <br/>
      It is recommendable to spread the liquid material by using a spin coating technology.
      <br/>
      If the partition wall 21c is connected to a suitable driving mechanism (not shown), the partition wall 21c is driven for rotation together with the semiconductor wafer 25.
      <br/>
      In this instance, the liquid material mainly contains diisobutyl-aluminum-hydride expressed as Al(i-C4 H9)2 H. Although the liquid material enters into an upper space of the contact hole 32a, the liquid material does not reach the silicon wafer 31 due to the large viscosity of diisobutyl-aluminum-hydride, and a void 33 takes place between the silicon wafer 31 and the liquid material layer.
      <br/>
      The cooled semiconductor wafer 25 condenses the diisobutyl-aluminum-hydride on the silicon oxide layer 32, and the void 33 is confined between the silicon wafer 31 and the layer 34 of the condensate of diisobutyl-aluminum-hydride as shown in FIG. 5B.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Subsequently, the valve 21p is opened, and the high-pressure gas is introduced into the chamber 21a.
      <br/>
      In this instance, the high-pressure gas is hydrogen, and the pressure is regulated to 100 kg/square-cm.
      <br/>
      The high-pressure gas presses down the layer 34 of the condensate, and the layer 34 of the condensate reaches the silicon wafer 31 as shown in FIG. 5C. Thus, the void 33 is collapsed by exerting the force on the layer 34 of the condensate.

    <p num="40">
      The valves 21p and the 21o are closed, and the flash lamp 21k radiates light, and the reflector 21m directs the light toward the semiconductor wafer 25.

    </p>
    <p num="41">As a result, gaseous product 35 is separated from an aluminum layer 36, and the aluminum layer 36 not only perfectly fills the contact hole 32a but also extends over the silicon oxide layer 32.</p>
    <p num="42">The present inventor evaluated the aluminum layer 36, and confirmed that the aluminum layer 36 was lower in resistivity than those formed through the prior art processes.</p>
    <p num="43">
      As will be appreciated from the foregoing description, the condensate is pushed into the contact hole 32a, and the contact hole 32a is perfectly filled with the condensate.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor wafer 25 cooled rather than the chamber 21a allows the liquid material to smoothly enter into the contact hole.
      <br/>
      Low temperature makes the vapor pressure of the liquid material small, and the condensate easily flow into the contact hole against the vaporized material.
      <br/>
      For this reason, no void takes place in the contact hole, and the contact hole 32a is perfectly plugged with a piece of metal.
