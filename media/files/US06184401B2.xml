    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to fluorinated alkynoic acids, to the preparation thereof, and to the use thereof as anti-convulsive therapeutic agents.
      <br/>
      The fluorinated alkynoic acids of the invention are comparable to valproic acid in their utility for the prevention of seizures, but have reduced teratogenic potential.
      <br/>
      Consequently, this invention provides effective anti-epileptic agents with a greater margin of safety than valproic acid with respect to teratogenic potential.
      <br/>
      Certain compounds of this invention also exhibit comparable or reduced sedative effects relative to valproic acid, and certain compounds of the invention exhibit a longer duration of activity than valproic acid.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Epilepsy affects roughly 1% of the world'population.
      <br/>
      Among the drugs employed for control of epileptic seizures is valproic acid.
      <br/>
      Valproic acid (also referred to as VPA, valproate, or 2-propylpentanoic acid) is an effective anticonvulsant, but it has a short duration of action.
      <br/>
      More seriously, VPA suffers from serious side effects, among them sedation, potentially fatal hepatotoxicity, and teratogenicity.
      <br/>
      Hepatotoxicity is particularly a problem in young children, especially children on polytherapy.
      <br/>
      The VPA-induced hepatic fatality rate among the latter patient category is reported to be 1/500 (F. E. Dreifuiss et al., Neurology (1987), 37, 379-385).
      <br/>
      Valproic acid has been shown to induce neural tube defects in mice, and it is estimated that the risk of spina bifida among newborns of women taking VPA during pregnancy is 1-2% (Centers for Disease Control, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (1983), 32(33), 438-439).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      There has been a considerable effort to discover analogues of valproic acid that are equally effective, but that have a greater margin of safety.
      <br/>
      See, for example, H. Nau et al., PCT application WO 94/06743, wherein a variety of modifications to the alkyl chains of valproic acid are made, and the related U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,380, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      With regard to teratogenicity, it has been reported that introduction of a triple bond into the 4-position of valproic acid greatly increases teratogenicity, but that this effect is largely confined to the S-(-) enantiomer.
      <br/>
      Addition of a methyl group to the end of the triple bond abolished teratogenicity, while maintaining anticonvulsant activity (H.
      <br/>
      Nau, R.-S. Hauck, K. Ehlers, Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology (1991), 69, 310-321.) These results indicated that separation of teratogenicity and anticonvulsive activity was possible.
      <br/>
      Sedative side effects were also separated from anticonvulsant activity in some analogues (M.
      <br/>
      Elmazar, R.-S. Hauck, H. Nau, J. Pharm. Sci. (1993), 82, 1255-1288.)
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Alpha-branched carboxylic acids with an alpha-fluorine are little known. P. Crowley et al., in European patent application EP 468681, refers to 2-ethyl-2-fluorobutanoic acid as a fungicide intermediate, and a method for its preparation.
      <br/>
      Takeuchi refers to several examples of this class of compound in a publication relating to methods of preparing tertiary alkyl fluorides (Y.
      <br/>
      Takeuchi et al., J. Org. Chem. (1993), 58(13), 3483-3485).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The valproic acid analogue 2-fluoro-2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid has also been reported.
      <br/>
      The compound was used as a probe for studies of valproic acid hepatotoxicity and metabolism. (W. Tang et al., Chem. Res. Toxicol. (1995), 8(5), 671-682; M. Jurima-Romet et al., Toxicology (1996), 112(1), 69-85; W. Tang and F. Abbott, Drug Metab.
      <br/>
      Dispos. (1997), 25(2), 219-227.) In the above references, the presence of the 2-fluoro substituent was reported to reduce hepatotoxicity relative to 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid.
      <br/>
      Anticonvulsant, sedative or teratogenic properties of the fluorinated compound were not disclosed.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Alpha-fluorinated valproic acid, 2-fluoro-2-propylpentanoic acid, has also been reported (Ph.D. thesis of Wei Tang, University of British Columbia, 1996).
      <br/>
      The anticonvulsant activity and pharmacokinetics of this compound were studied, and its pharmaceutical potential was speculated upon (F.
      <br/>
      Abbott, W. Tang, J. Palaty, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. (1997), 282, 1163-1172).
      <br/>
      The compound was reported to be less potent than VPA, and the hepatotoxic, sedative, or teratogenic properties were not disclosed.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Valproic acid analogues with terminal trifluoromethyl groups have been reported: 5,5,5-trifluoro-2-(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl) pentanoic acid (K.
      <br/>
      Yamaguchi and M. Taninaka, Japanese patent Application 4-21652 (1992), and 5,5,5-trifluoro-2-n-propyl pentanoic acid (Hiroshima et al., Japan. J. Psychopharmacol. (1992) 12, 427).
      <br/>
      These compounds, too, are less potent than VPA.

    </p>
    <p num="21">
      These compounds can be prepared by methods known in the art for the preparation of other alpha-fluoro carboxylic acids.
      <br/>
      For example, treatment of the corresponding alpha-hydroxy ester with diethylaminosulftir trifluoride (DAST) provides the alpha-fluoro ester, which upon hydrolysis provides the acid (P.
      <br/>
      Crowley et al., 1992, European patent application EP 468681).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the corresponding alpha-amino acid can be subjected to diazotization in the presence of fluoride ion, to effect a deaminative fluorination (J.
      <br/>
      Barber, R. Keck, J. Retey, Tetrahedron Letters (1982), 23, 1549-1552).
      <br/>
      The Reformatsky reaction can be carried out on alpha-bromo-alpha-fluoro esters (Y.
      <br/>
      Takeuchi et al., J. Org. Chem. (1993), 58(13), 3483-3485) to introduce a side chain.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the corresponding ester enolate or silyl enol ether can be fluorinated with fluorine or a "positive fluorine" source, such as an N-fluoro pyridinium salt, N-fluoro amide, or N-fluoro imide (see, e.g., E. Differding, G. Ruegg, Tetrahedron Letters (1991), 32, 3815-3818).
      <br/>
      In the particular embodiment exemplified below, the lithium enolate of the corresponding ester is fluorinated with N-fluoro benzenesulfonimide, but it will be understood that other methods of synthesis are within the scope of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The starting esters for the exemplified process are in many cases commercially available; alternatively they may be obtained by methods known in the art, for example the malonic ester synthesis described in M. Elmazar, R.-S. Hauck, H. Nau, J. Pharm. Sci. (1993), 82, 1255-1288.
      <br/>
      The well-known acetoacetate variation of the malonic ester synthesis is also applicable.
      <br/>
      In the example below, direct alkylation of a straight-chain ester enolate is employed.
      <br/>
      Other methods of synthesis will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and this invention is not limited by the particular synthetic method exemplified herein.
    </p>
    <p num="23">In general terms, this invention provides a process for preparation of compounds of structure I, which comprises the steps of:</p>
    <p num="24">
      a) alkylating a compound of structure  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
      <br/>
      wherein R3 is lower alkyl or benzyl and R4 is H, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, or benzyloxy, with an alkylating reagent of structure
      <br/>
      R2 --C.tbd.C--CH2 --X  (III)
      <br/>
      wherein X is a suitable leaving group, and wherein R2 is C1 to C3 alkyl or cyclopropyl, in the presence of a suitable base, so as to obtain a compound of structure  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)
      <br/>
      (b) in the cases where R4 is lower alkoxy or benzyloxy, hydrolysis, decarboxylation, and re-esterification of compound IV; or in cases where R4 is H or lower alkyl, deacylation of compound IV, so as to obtain a compound of structure  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)
      <br/>
      (c) enolization of compound V with a suitable base, in an inert solvent;
      <br/>
      (d) addition of a fluorinating reagent, so as to obtain a compound of structure  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)
      <br/>
      and
      <br/>
      (e) hydrolysis of the ester moiety.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Suitable identities of group R4 will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Preferred R4 groups are alkoxy groups which are readily saponified, such as methoxy or ethoxy, or other carboxylic acid protecting groups which are readily removed by other means, such as tert-butoxy, benzyloxy, and the like.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that the term "hydrolysis" as used in steps (b) and (e) is intended to encompass the deprotecting operations appropriate to the nature of R4, for example saponification in the case of lower alkoxy groups, acidolysis in the case of tert-butoxy groups or hydrogenolysis in the case of benzyloxy groups.
      <br/>
      Similar considerations apply to the group R3, which is preferably lower alkyl such as methyl or ethyl but which may be another carboxy-protecting group, such as for example, tert-butyl, benzyl, and the like.
      <br/>
      It will be apparent that in step (b), where R3 is removed and then re-introduced, the practitioner will have the opportunity to change the identity of R3 if it is desired to do so.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Where R4 is H or alkyl, the preferred groups are those which lend themselves to deacylation of the group COR4 ; in these cases R4 is most preferably H or methyl.
      <br/>
      Deacylation may be accomplished by treatment with, for example, sodium hydroxide or ammonia, or other methods known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Suitable leaving groups X may be selected from, but are not limited to, the halogens chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or sulfonate ester groups such as methanesulfonyloxy or toluenesulfonyloxy.
      <br/>
      Suitable bases for step (a) may be chosen from, but are not limited to, alkali metal alkoxides, calcium and magnesium alkoxides, alkali metal hydrides, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Suitable bases for step (c) will be apparent to those skilled in the art, since a number of procedures for enolizing esters have been published.
      <br/>
      Preferred bases will be those with a sufficiently high pKa to substantially deprotonate the compound V, and which are also non-reactive with the functional groups of the compound V. Examples may be chosen from, but are not limited to, the lithium or sodium salts of hindered disubstituted amines, such as lithium diisopropylamide or lithium hexamethyldisilazide.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In an alternative process, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by the process comprising the steps of:
      <br/>
      a) alkylating a compound of structure  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)
      <br/>
      wherein R3 is lower alkyl or benzyl with an alkylating reagent of structure
      <br/>
      R2 --C.tbd.C--CH2 --X  (III)
      <br/>
      wherein X is a suitable leaving group, and wherein R2 is C1 to C3 alkyl or cyclopropyl, in the presence of a suitable base, so as to obtain a compound of structure  (Chemical Structure image '8' not included in text)
      <br/>
      (b) enolization of compound V with a suitable base, in an inert solvent;
      <br/>
      (c) addition of a fluorinating reagent, so as to obtain a compound of structure  (Chemical Structure image '9' not included in text)
      <br/>
      and
      <br/>
      (d) hydrolysis of the ester moiety.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Modifications to the exemplified procedures can also be made.
      <br/>
      For example, in the fluorination step, inert solvents other than THF may be employed, such as dioxane, di-alkyl ethers, dimethoxyethane and other polyethers, toluene, heptane, and the like.
      <br/>
      Additives such as hexamethylphosphoramide, tetramethylethylenediamine, or tetramethylurea can be employed in the alkylation and fluorination reactions, and as described above a variety of bases such as alkali metal hydride, amide, alkoxide, or hexamethyldisilazide salts could be employed in the deprotonation and enolization reactions.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Alpha-fluorination of a straight-chain alkyl or alkynyl ester, acid, or amide prior to alkylation might also be carried out, if deemed desirable by the practitioner.
      <br/>
      Such modifications could be made for any reason, for example to improve the yield or to reduce process costs, without departing from the scope of this invention.

      For example, the methods of this invention are useful for treating individuals with idiopathic generalized seizures such as absence, myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures and partial seizures.
      <br/>
      Individuals suffering from epilepsy, in particular, are expected to benefit from administration of the compounds of this invention.
      <br/>
      The method of the invention comprises administering to an individual a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of formula I or a salt or prodrug thereof, which is sufficient to reduce or prevent seizure activity.

      Dosages may be similar to those used with VPA, however they may be adjusted appropriately, based on the potencies and kinetic parameters disclosed herein or as determined by routine methods.
      <br/>
      For example, the compound 2-fluoro-2-n-propyl-4-hexynoic acid (example 3) would be expected to be useful at dosages which are about 1.5 times greater than those used for VPA.
      <br/>
      A preferred initial dose for this compound, accordingly, may be estimated to be between about 10 and 100 mg/kg/day, more preferably between 20 and 50 mg/kg/day.
      <br/>
      This initial dose may be varied so as to obtain the optimum therapeutic effect in the patient.
      <br/>
      Generally, a dose of between 1 and 150 mg/kg/day of the compounds of the invention would be expected to be administered to an individual, either singly or in divided doses.

    <p num="41">
      This invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions useful for providing anticonvulsant activity, which comprise at least one compound of the invention.
      <br/>
      In addition to comprising at least one of the compounds described by formula I or a salt or prodrug thereof, the pharmaceutical composition may also comprise one or more additives such as preservatives, excipients, fillers, wetting agents, binders, disintegrants, buffers, and carriers.
      <br/>
      Suitable additives may be for example magnesium and calcium carbonates, carboxymethylcellulose, starches, sugars, gums, magnesium or calcium stearate, coloring or flavoring agents, and the like.
      <br/>
      There exists a wide variety of pharmaceutically acceptable additives for pharmaceutical dosage forms, and selection of appropriate additives is a routine matter for those skilled in art of pharmaceutical formulation.
    </p>
    <p num="42">The compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, suppositories, reconstitutable powders, or liquid preparations such as oral or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions.</p>
    <p num="43">
      In order to obtain consistency of administration it is preferred that a composition of the invention is in the form of a unit dose.
      <br/>
      Unit dose forms for oral administration may be tablets, capsules, and the like, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; and carriers or fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine.
      <br/>
      Additives may include disintegrants, for example starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium starch glycolate or microcrystalline cellulose; preservatives, and pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulfate.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In addition to unit dose forms, multi-dosage forms are also contemplated to be within the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Delayed-release compositions, for example those prepared by employing slow-release coatings, micro-encapsulation, and/or slowly-dissolving polymer carriers, will also be apparent to those skilled in the art, and are contemplated to be within the scope of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling, tabletting or the like.
      <br/>
      Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers.
      <br/>
      Such operations are conventional in the art.
      <br/>
      The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice, for example with an enteric coating.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use.
      <br/>
      Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminum stearate gel, and hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example almond oil or fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as esters of glycerin, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid; and if desired conventional flavoring or coloring agents.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile carrier, and, depending on the concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the carrier.
      <br/>
      In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved in water or saline for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, additives such as local anaesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Suitable buffering agents are, for example, phosphate and citrate salts.
      <br/>
      To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum.
      <br/>
      Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner, except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved, and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration.
      <br/>
      The compound can be sterilized by conventional means, for example by exposure to radiation or ethylene oxide, before being suspended in the sterile carrier.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.
