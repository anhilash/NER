      An optical head is composed of an objective 2, a composite diffraction element 3 having six areas divided by three parting lines 3a to 3c; and a substrate 5 on which a light-emitting element and a plurality of light-receiving elements are arranged.
      <br/>
      A focus and a tracking error signals are generated based on signals from the light-receiving elements that receive those of a plurality of luminous fluxes divided by the composite diffraction element 3 which result from passage through the portion between the parting lines 3b and 3c.
      <br/>
      In generating the tracking error signal, signals from the light-receiving elements that receive luminous fluxes resulting from passage through the outside of the parting lines 3b and 3c are used to correct an offset in the tracking error signal caused by the movement of the objective.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an optical head that optically records information on an information-recording medium such as an optical disc or reproduces or deletes information therefrom, and to an information recording and reproduction apparatus that uses this optical head.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Art of the Invention</p>
    <p num="4">
      An optical head that uses a push pull signal to generate a tracking error signal is commonly used due to an advantage that it can be implemented in an optical system of a simple configuration.
      <br/>
      It, however, has a disadvantage that an offset occurs in a tracking error a signal as an objective moves in a tracking direction.
      <br/>
      A technique that compensates for this disadvantage is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 8-306057 and Japanese Patent Application No. 7-280372.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The conventional techniques are described below with reference to the drawings.
      <br/>
      FIG. 18 shows a configuration of a first conventional technique that is an optical head in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 8-306057. In this figure, 74 is the optical axis of the optical head; 75 is a light source; 76 and 77 are half mirrors; 78 is an objective; 79 is an actuator that moves the objective in the X and Y directions; 80 is an optical disc that is an information-recording medium; 81 is a six-piece light-receiving element (In the figure, a sub-figure showing the locational relationship between the element 81 and the optical axis 74 and a sub-figure showing a detection state are shown in parallel); 81a to 81c are parting lines of the six-piece light-receiving element 81; 82a to 82f are divided light-receiving areas; 83 is a differential amplifier that is an operation circuit; 84 is a luminous flux on the six-piece light-receiving element 81; 88 is a focus control section; and 89 is a tracking control section.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Next, the operation of the optical head of the above configuration is described.
      <br/>
      Light from the light source 75 is reflected by the half mirror 76 and converged by the objective 78 on an information-recording surface of the optical disc 80 to form a light spot.
      <br/>
      Information tracks are formed on the optical disc 80, and their direction is perpendicular to the sheet of the drawing in FIG. 18. Reflected light from the optical disc 80 is transmitted through the objective 78 and half mirror 76 and separated into two luminous fluxes by the half mirror 77.
      <br/>
      Luminous fluxes reflected from the half mirror 77 are incident on the focus control section 88, and transmitted luminous fluxes enter the six-piece light-receiving element 81.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      An addition provided by the connections in the figure and a differential operation performed by the differential amplifier 83 generate a tracking error signal, which is then guided to the tracking control section 89.
      <br/>
      The focus control section 88 detects a focus error signal and controls the actuator 79 so that light is converged on the information-recording surface of the optical disc.
      <br/>
      Based on the detected tracking error signal, the tracking control section 89 controls the actuator 79 in such a way that the light spot is guided to the center of the information tracks, and moves the objective 78 in the X-positive and -negative direction using the optical axis 74 of the optical head as a reference.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      FIGS. 19(a) and 19(b) show the position of the luminous flux 84 on the six-piece light-receiving element 81; FIG. 19(a) shows that the objective 78 is located at a reference position, and FIG. 19(b) shows that the objective moves in the X-positive direction.
      <br/>
      Two shaded parts in the luminous flux 84 show area in which a zero-order diffracted luminous flux and a positive and a negative first order diffracted luminous fluxes, which are diffracted by the optical disc 80, interfere with each other.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In FIG. 19(a), the luminous flux 84 is symmetrical relative to the parting line 81a, so an output signal form the differential amplifier 83 is a tracking error signal without offset.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in FIG. 19(b), the luminous flux 84 is moved to the right to lose its symmetry relative to the parting line 81a, and the area of the luminous flux contained in each of areas 82b, 82d and 82f increases while the area of the luminous flux contained in each of areas 82a, 82c, and 82e decreases.
      <br/>
      When a signal detected in each light-receiving area is represented by its area name and the tracking error signal is referred to as TE, the operation performed by the differential amplifier 83 is as follows:
      <br/>
      TE=82a+82e+82d-k*(82b+82f+82c)  �Equation 3�
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      wherein (k) is a correction coefficient.
      <br/>
      A push pull signal component appears in the areas 82c and 82d mainly containing the shaded interfering areas, whereas an offset component appears in the other areas mainly due to the movement of the luminous flux.
      <br/>
      Thus, by setting the correction coefficient (k) at an appropriate value, the operation in Equation 3 provides a tracking error signal in which an offset is corrected that is caused by the movement of the objective.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Next, a second conventional technique that is the optical head in Japanese Patent Application No. 7-280372 is described.
      <br/>
      The configuration of this optical head is similar to that of the first conventional technique except for the division of the light-receiving element.
      <br/>
      Thus, its configuration diagram is omitted and only the configuration of the multi-piece light-receiving element is described.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 20(a) is a top view of an eight-piece light-receiving element.
      <br/>
      Reference numerals 85a to 85c designate parting lines of the eight-piece light-receiving element 85; 86a to 86h are divided light-receiving areas; 87 is a luminous flux on the eight-piece light-receiving element 85; and the shaded part in the figure is an area that is not exposed to light.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The operation of the optical head according to the second conventional technique is almost the same as that of the optical head according to the first conventional technique.
      <br/>
      Thus, the description of the operation is omitted and only the features obtained by configuring the eight-piece light-receiving element as described above are explained.
      <br/>
      FIG. 20(b) schematically shows the distribution of the amount of light in the luminous flux 87 which is generated when the optical disc is tilted in the radial direction, wherein the magnitude of light intensity is represented by the density of diagonal lines.
      <br/>
      In this figure, the light intensity increases with increasing density of diagonal lines.
      <br/>
      This figure indicates that asymmetrical light intensity occurs at the center of the luminous flux due to the inclination of the optical disc in the radial direction, and this asymmetry of the intensity distribution results in an offset in the push pull signal.
      <br/>
      If a shaded portion is present in the center as shown in FIG. 20(a), the effect of the asymmetrical light intensity shown in FIG. 20(b) can be reduced.
      <br/>
      When a signal detected in each area is represented by the corresponding area name, the tracking error signal TE can be obtained by the following equation:
      <br/>
      TE=86c+86e-(86d+86f)-k*+86a+86g-(86b+86h)}  �Equation 4�
    </p>
    <p num="14">wherein (k) is a correction coefficient.</p>
    <p num="15">As described above, the first conventional technique can correct an offset in the tracking signal caused by the movement of the objective in the tracking direction, and the second conventional technique can reduce an offset in the tracking signal caused by the inclination of the optical disc in the radial direction.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The conventional techniques, however, divide a luminous flux on the light-receiving element to detect a possible tracking error, so separate optical systems are required to detect a focus and a tracking error signals.
      <br/>
      Consequently, despite the simple configuration of the detecting optical system of a tracking error, it is difficult to miniaturize or integrate the optical head.

      The graphics shown inside each light-receiving element schematically show the shape of a luminous flux incident on the element.
    </p>
    <p num="51">The optical head according to this invention has a signal generation means, a focus control section, a tracking control section, which are all described in detail in FIGS. 14 to 16.</p>
    <p num="52">
      FIG. 14 is a schematic drawing describing a configuration of a control section of the optical head according to this embodiment.
      <br/>
      FIG. 15 is a connection diagram of a circuit that generates a focus error signal that is input to the focus control section shown in FIG. 14. FIG. 16 shows a circuit diagram of a circuit that generates a tracking error signal that is input to the tracking control section shown in FIG. 14.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In FIG. 14, an actuator 1041 is a means for moving the objective 2 in the X and Y directions.
      <br/>
      In addition, a tracking control section 1042 is a means for using a tracking error signal to control the actuator 104180 as to guide a light spot to the center of information tracks, and basically has the same configuration as the tracking control section 89 described in FIG. 18. In addition, a focus control section 1043 is a means for using a focus error signal to control the actuator 1041 so as to converge light on an information-recording surface of the optical disc 1.
    </p>
    <p num="54">A first parting line according to this invention corresponds to a parting line 3a, and a second and a third parting lines according to this invention similarly correspond to parting lines 3b and 3c.</p>
    <p num="55">
      Next, the operation of the optical head of the above configuration is described.
      <br/>
      Light emitted by the light-emitting element 4 is transmitted through the composite diffraction element 3 and converged by the objective 2 on the information-recording surface of the optical disc 1.
      <br/>
      Information tracks are formed on the information-recording surface of the optical disc 1 and extend perpendicularly to the sheet of the drawing in FIG. 1(a).
      <br/>
      After passing through the objective 2, reflected light from the optical disc 1 advances to the neighborhood of the light-emitting element 4 while converging and is then incident on the composite diffraction element 3.
      <br/>
      After passing through the areas of the composite diffraction element 3 divided by the parting lines 3a to 3c, the luminous flux is transmitted as a positive first order, a zero order, and a negative first order diffracted beams.
      <br/>
      Of the transmitted beams, the positive and negative first order diffracted beams travel toward the corresponding light-receiving elements.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Diffracted beams through the areas 6a and 6e of the composite diffraction element 3 are incident on, for example, light-receiving elements 7a and 7d, diffracted beams through the areas 6b and 6f of the composite diffraction element 3 are incident on, for example, the light-receiving elements 7b and 7c, a diffracted beam through the area 6c is incident on, for example, the three-piece light-receiving elements 9 and 10, and a diffracted beam through the area 6d is incident on, for example, the three-piece light-receiving elements 8 and 11.
      <br/>
      In this case, when the diffraction grating patterns in the areas 6c and 6d of the composite diffraction element 3 have refracting power such as that of a lens in such a way that, for example, the luminous fluxes incident on the three-piece light-receiving elements 9 and 11 converge into a focus at points further than these light-receiving elements, while the luminous fluxes incident on the three-piece light-receiving elements 8 and 10 converge into a focus at points nearer to the composite diffraction element 3 than these light-receiving elements and that when the optical disc 1 is placed at the focal point of the objective 2, the lengths of the luminous fluxes on the three-piece light-receiving elements 8, 9, 10, and 11 are substantially equal in the direction orthogonal to the parting lines of these light-receiving elements, then the magnitudes of the luminous fluxes on the three-piece light-receiving elements change to different values depending on the offset of the focal point of the objective 2.
      <br/>
      Thus, a focus error signal FE is obtained by the following operation:
      <br/>
      FE=9b+11b+8a+8c+10a+10c-(9a+9c+11a+11c+8b+10b)  �Equation 7�
    </p>
    <p num="57">A connection diagram of connections for realizing this operation is shown in FIG. 15. An addition provided by the connection shown in this figure and a differential operation performed by a differential amplifier 1051 generate a focus error signal FE, which is then guided to the focus control section 1043.</p>
    <p num="58">
      In addition, a signal TE1 for correcting a tracking offset caused by the movement of the objective 2 in the direction orthogonal to the information tracks is obtained by the following equation by detecting luminous fluxes passing through the areas outside the area parting lines 3b and 3c of the composite diffraction element 3 based on the luminous-flux division of the above conventional technique:
      <br/>
      TE1=7a+7d-(7b+7c)  �Equation 8�
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      A push pull signal TE2 is obtained by the following equation by detecting a luminous flux passing through the area between the area parting lines 3b and 3c of the composite diffraction element 3:
      <br/>
      TE2=(9a+9b+9c+10a+10b+10c)-(8a+8b+8c+11a+11b+11c)  �Equation 9�
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Thus, a tracking error signal TE in which an offset is corrected that is caused by the movement of the objective 2 is expressed as follows:
      <br/>
      TE=TE2-k*TE1  �Equation 10�
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      wherein (k) is a correction coefficient.
      <br/>
      In the above four equations, the detection signal names are represented by the light-receiving area names.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      A connection diagram of connections for realizing the above operations is shown in FIG. 16. An addition provided by the connections shown in this figure and a differential operation performed by differential amplifiers 1061 and 1062 generate the tracking offset correction signal TE1 and push pull signal TE2.
      <br/>
      These signals are input to a differential amplifier 1063 to perform a differential operation as described above.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the differential amplifier 1063 generates the tracking error signal TE, which is then guided to the tracking control section 1042.
    </p>
    <p num="63">In this configuration, when the interval between the parting lines 3b and 3c of the composite diffraction element 3 is designated as V, the numerical aperture of the objective on the optical-disc side is denoted as NA, the wavelength is indicated as  LAMBDA , the pitch of the information tracks is referred to as (d), and the diameter of a luminous flux passing through the composite diffraction element 3 is denoted as D, the following equation is desirably met:  (Equation image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="64">
      The reason is explained with reference to FIG. 19(a).
      <br/>
      The area parting lines 3a to 3c of the composite diffraction element 3 correspond to the parting lines 81a to 81c in FIG. 19(a).
      <br/>
      In this figure, the shaded part represents an area in which the positive and negative first order diffracted beams diffracted by the information tracks of the optical disc interfere with the zero order diffracted beam, and this area contains push pull signal components.
      <br/>
      Meeting Equation 11 means that the amount of shaded area mixed into the area outside the parting lines 81b and 81c is limited and that an amount of detection signal is obtained that is sufficient to correct an offset in the tracking signal.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if Equation 11 is not met, the amount of correction signal TE1 is too small to provide sufficient corrections or the amount of push pull signal mixed into the correction signal TE1 increases to reduce the amplitude of the signal TE based on the operation in Equation 10.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The optical head configured as described above has a means for correcting an offset in the tracking error signal caused by the movement of the objective and allows the same detecting optical system to detect the focus and tracking error signals.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, these features are realized by the two optical parts, that is, the composite diffraction element and the substrate on which the light-emitting and light-receiving elements are arranged, thereby reducing the size of the optical head.
    </p>
    <p num="66">Although this embodiment generates a focus error signal based on signals from the four three-piece light-receiving elements that receive four luminous fluxes diffracted by the areas 6c and 6d, it is not limited to this aspect but the focus error signal can be generated based on signals from, for example, two three-piece light-receiving elements.</p>
    <p num="67">
      As described above, the focus error signal varies with the length of a luminous flux in the direction perpendicular to the parting lines of the three-piece light-receiving element, so a focus error signal can be obtained based on the following Equation 53 using, for example, a detection signal obtained at the three-piece light-receiving element 9 on which a luminous flux is incident and then converges into a focus at a point further than the light-receiving element and a detection signal obtained at the three-piece light-receiving element 10 on which a luminous flux is incident and then converges into a focus at a point nearer to the composite diffraction element than the light-receiving element:
      <br/>
      FE=9b+10a+10c-(9a+9c+10b)  �Equation 53�
    </p>
    <p num="68">With respect to the combination of two of the four three-piece light-receiving elements, different combinations are possible as long as one of the focal points of luminous fluxes incident on the respective light-receiving elements is near that light-receiving element whereas the other is far from the light-receiving element.</p>
    <p num="69">Second Embodiment</p>

      FIG. 2(a) shows a configuration of an optical head according to a second embodiment of this invention.

      The configuration of this optical head is similar to that in the first embodiment, so the same components have the same reference numerals and their description is omitted.

      In FIG. 2(a), 13 is a composite diffraction element and 14 is a substrate that is integrated with the light-emitting element 4 and on which light-receiving elements are arranged.

      In FIG. 2(b), 13a to 13c are area parting lines of the composite diffraction element 13; and 15a to 15f are divided areas wherein the stripes in the areas conceptually show the direction of the diffraction grating.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2(c) is a top view of the substrate 14, wherein 16a to 16d are unitary light-receiving elements; 17 to 20 are three-piece light-receiving elements; and 17a to 17c, 18a to 18c, 19a to 19c, and 20a to 20c are light-receiving areas each constituting the three-piece light-receiving element.
      <br/>
      The graphics shown inside each light-receiving element schematically show the shape of a luminous flux incident on the element.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The operation of the optical head of the above configuration is described below.
      <br/>
      Since it also has many characteristics in common with the first embodiment, only different features are explained.
      <br/>
      A luminous flux reflected by the optical disc 1 and again entering the composite diffraction element 3 is divided into a positive and a negative first order diffracted beams through the areas divided by the three parting lines 13a to 13c, and the diffracted beams travel toward the corresponding light-receiving elements.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Diffracted beams through the areas 15a and 15c of the composite diffraction element 13 are incident on, for example, the light-receiving elements 16a and 16d, diffracted beams through the areas 15b and 15f are incident on, for example, the light-receiving elements 16b and 16c, a diffracted beam through the area 15c is incident on, for example, the three-piece light-receiving elements 17 and 20, and a diffracted beam through the area 15d is incident on, for example, the three-piece light-receiving elements 18 and 19.
      <br/>
      In this case, when the diffraction grating patterns in the areas 15c and 15d have refracting power such as that of a lens in such a way that, for example, the luminous fluxes incident on the three-piece light-receiving elements 17 and 18 converge into a focus at points further than these light-receiving elements, while the luminous fluxes incident on the three-piece light-receiving elements 19 and 20 converge into a focus at points nearer to the composite diffraction element 13 than these light-receiving elements and that when the optical disc 1 is placed at the focal point of the objective 2, the magnitudes of the luminous fluxes on the three-piece light-receiving elements 17, 18, 19, and 20 are substantially equal in the direction orthogonal to the parting lines of these light-receiving elements, then the magnitudes of the luminous fluxes on the three-piece light-receiving elements change to different values depending on the offset of the focal point of the objective 2.
      <br/>
      Thus, a focus error signal FE is obtained by the following operation:
      <br/>
      FE=17b+18b+19a+19c+20a+20c -(17a+17c+18a+18c+19b+20b)  �Equation 12�
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      In addition, as in the first embodiment, a signal TE1 for correcting a tracking error signal offset is obtained by the following equation:
      <br/>
      TE1=16a+16d-(16b+16c)  �Equation 13�
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      A push pull signal TE2 is expressed as follows:

    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Thus, a tracking error signal TE in which an offset is corrected that is caused by the movement of the objective is expressed as follows:

      TE=TE2-k*TE1  �Equation 15�
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      wherein (k) is a correction coefficient.

      In the above four equations, the detection signal names are represented by the light-receiving area names.

    <p num="78">In this configuration, when the interval between the parting lines 13b and 13c of the composite diffraction element 13 is designated as V, Equation 11 is desirably met as in the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="79">
      The feature of the above second embodiment is that the three-piece light-receiving elements are located at an equal distance from the light-emitting element in contrast to the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      This configuration advantageously reduces the width of the light-receiving element 14 in the horizontal direction.
      <br/>
      This embodiment is also advantageous in that even if the diffraction efficiency varies with the pitch of the diffraction grating due to the variation of an etching condition during a composite-diffraction element manufacturing process, the variation of the balance of a detection signal is small because of the equal diffraction grating pitch for each area according to this embodiment.

      The operation of the optical head of the above configuration is described below.

      Since it also has many characteristics in common with the first embodiment, only different features are explained.

      A luminous flux reflected by the optical disc and again entering the composite diffraction element is divided into a positive and a negative first order diffracted beams through the areas divided by the three parting lines 29a to 29c, and the diffracted beams travel toward the corresponding light-receiving elements.

      Diffracted beams through the areas 31a and 31c are incident on, for example, the light-receiving elements 33a and 33d, diffracted beams through the areas 31b and 31d are incident on, for example, the light-receiving elements 33b and 33c.

      <br/>
      When the diffracted beams from the assembly of band-like divisions are distributed to the light-receiving elements in this manner, the luminous flux passing between the area parting lines 29b and 29c is spatially divided into halves shaped like band-like division, which are incident on the two three-piece light-receiving elements 34 and 36, respectively.
      <br/>
      This means that by dividing the luminous flux into a sufficiently large number of band-like divided beams, this luminous-flux division becomes equivalent to amplitude division.
      <br/>
      This case can be handled in the same manner as in the first and second embodiments.

      Diffracted beams through the areas 49a and 49g of the composite diffraction element are incident on, for example, the light-receiving elements 50a and 50d, diffracted beams through the areas 49b and 49h are incident on, for example, the light-receiving elements 50b and 50c, a diffracted beam through the area 49c is incident on, for example, the two-piece light-receiving element 51 and light-receiving area 54b, a diffracted beam through the area 49d is incident on, for example, the two-piece light-receiving element 51 and light-receiving area 54a, a diffracted beam through the area 49e is incident on, for example, the two-piece light-receiving element 53 and light-receiving area 52b, and a diffracted beam through the area 49f is incident on, for example, the two-piece light-receiving element 53 and light-receiving area 52a.
      <br/>
      In this case, when the diffraction grating patterns in the areas 49c, 49d, 49e, and 49f have refracting power such as that of lens in such a way that, for example, the luminous flux incident on the two-piece light-receiving element 51 converges into a focus at a point further than this light-receiving element, while the luminous flux incident on the two-piece light-receiving element 53 converges into a focus at a point nearer to the composite diffraction element than this light-receiving element and that when the optical disc is placed at the focal point of the objective, the magnitudes of the luminous fluxes on the two-piece light-receiving elements 51 and 53 are substantially equal in the direction orthogonal to the parting lines of these light-receiving elements, then the magnitudes of the luminous fluxes on the two-piece light-receiving elements change to different values depending on the offset of the focal point of the objective.

      In FIG. 11, 101 is a substrate on which light-emitting and light-receiving elements are arranged; 102a to 102d are unitary light-receiving elements; 103 and 104 are three-piece light-receiving elements; 105 and 106 are two-piece light-receiving elements; and 103a to 103c, 104a to 104c, 105a and 105b, and 106a and 106b are light-receiving areas each constituting the three-piece or two-piece light-receiving element.
      <br/>
      The graphics shown inside each light-receiving element schematically show the shape of a luminous flux incident on the element.

    <p num="180">
      The operation of the optical head of the above configuration is described below.
      <br/>
      Since it also has many characteristics in common with the ninth and tenth embodiments, only different features are explained.
      <br/>
      A luminous flux reflected by the optical disc and again entering the composite diffraction element is divided into a positive and a negative first order diffracted beams through the areas divided by the five parting lines 55a to 55e, and the diffracted beams travel toward the corresponding light-receiving elements.
      <br/>
      Diffracted beams through the areas 57a and 57c are incident on, for example, the light-receiving elements 102a and 102d, and diffracted beams through the areas 57b and 57d are incident on, for example, the light-receiving elements 102b and 102c.
      <br/>
      In addition, diffracted beams through the assembly of band-like divisions 58a are incident on, for example, the three-piece light-receiving element 104 and light-receiving area 105b, diffracted beams through the assembly of band-like divisions 58b are incident on, for example, the three-piece light-receiving element 103 and light-receiving area 106a, diffracted beams through the assembly of band-like divisions 58c are incident on, for example, the three-piece light-receiving element 103 and light-receiving area 106b, diffracted beams through the assembly of band-like divisions 58d are incident on, for example, the three-piece light-receiving element 104 and light-receiving area 105a, diffracted beams through the assembly of band-like divisions 58e are incident on, for example, the three-piece light-receiving element 104 and light-receiving area 105b, diffracted beams through the assembly of band-like divisions 58f are incident on, for example, the three-piece light-receiving element 103 and light-receiving area 106a, diffracted beams through the assembly of band-like divisions 58g are incident on, for example, the three-piece light-receiving element 103 and light-receiving area 106b, and diffracted beams through the assembly of band-like divisions 58h are incident on, for example, the three-piece light-receiving element 104 and light-receiving area 105a.
      <br/>
      In addition, diffracted beams through the assembly of band-like divisions 59a are incident on the three-piece light-receiving element 103 and light-receiving area 106a, diffracted beams through the assembly of band-like divisions 59b are incident on the three-piece light-receiving element 104 and light-receiving area 105a, diffracted beams through the assembly of band-like divisions 59c are incident on the three-piece light-receiving element 103 and light-receiving area 106b, and diffracted beams through the assembly of band-like divisions 59d are incident on the three-piece light-receiving element 104 and light-receiving area 105b.
      <br/>
      Thus, as in the ninth and tenth embodiments, a focus error signal FE is obtained by the following operation:
      <br/>
      FE=103b+104a+104c-(103a+103c+104b)  �Equation 49�
    </p>
    <p num="181">
      In addition, as described above, a signal TE1 for correcting a tracking error signal offset is obtained by the following equation:
      <br/>
      TE1=102a+102d-(102b+102c)  �Equation 50�
    </p>
    <p num="182">
      A push pull signal TE2 is obtained by detecting the differential between detection signals for luminous fluxes passing through the assemblies of band-like divisions 58a, 58b, 58e, and 58f located to the left of the area parting line 55a of the composite diffraction element and detection signals for luminous fluxes passing through the assemblies of band-like divisions 58c, 58d, 58g, and 58h located to the right of the area parting line 55a.
      <br/>
      Thus, this signal TE2 is determined by the following operation:
      <br/>
      TE2=105b+106a-(105a+106b)  �Equation 51�
    </p>
    <p num="183">
      In this case, in the area other than the areas used to detect a push pull signal, that is, in the four assemblies of band-like divisions 59a to 59d between the area parting lines 55d and 55e of the composite diffraction element, the light-receiving area that is the term having a positive sign in Equation 51 receives diffracted beams from the assemblies of band-like divisions 59a and 59d located on the respective sides of the parting line 55a, and the light-receiving area that is the term having a negative sign receives diffracted luminous fluxes from the assemblies of band-like divisions 59b and 59c located on the respective sides of the parting line 55a.
      <br/>
      If there are a sufficiently large number of band-like divisions, this band-like division becomes equivalent to amplitude division.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the luminous flux passing between the area parting lines 55d and 55e is spatially evenly divided into two beams, which are then evenly incident on the light-receiving areas that are the terms having positive and negative signs in Equation 51, respectively.
      <br/>
      As a result, the effect of these luminous fluxes is offset by the differential detection in Equation 51.
    </p>
    <p num="184">
      A tracking error signal TE in which an offset is corrected that is caused by the movement of the objective is expressed as follows:
      <br/>
      TE=TE2-k*TE1  �Equation 52�
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      wherein (k) is a correction coefficient.
      <br/>
      In the above four equations, the detection signal names are represented by the light-receiving area names.
    </p>
    <p num="186">
      The signal detection method according to this embodiment sets the diffraction angle of the composite diffraction element and the layout of the light-receiving elements so as to allow the luminous flux passing between the parting lines 55d and 55e evenly to enter the light-receiving elements that detect a push pull signal, as in the above tenth embodiment.
      <br/>
      This signal detection, however, is characterized in that the luminous fluxes on the light-receiving elements are allowed to have the same shape so that despite spread caused by diffraction, each luminous flux incident on the three-piece light-receiving element has a similar distribution of the amount of light.
      <br/>
      Thus, even if a luminous flux is modulated when the light spot traverses the tracks, that modulation is evenly received by each light-receiving area so the focus error signal is unlikely to be affected by the modulation.
    </p>
    <p num="187">In this configuration, as in the seventh embodiment, when the interval between the parting lines 55b and 55c of the composite diffraction element is designated as V, Equation 11 is desirably met, and when the interval between the parting lines 55d and 55e is indicated as W, Equation 36 is desirably met.</p>
    <p num="188">The above optical head according to this embodiment provides not only the effects of the tenth embodiment but also a focus error signal into which few modulation components are mixed while the light spot is traversing the tracks.</p>
    <p num="189">Twelfth Embodiment</p>
    <p num="190">
      FIG. 12(a) is a conceptual top view describing a composite diffraction element according to a twelfth embodiment of this invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 12(b) is a conceptual drawing of assemblies of band-like divisions between parting lines 107d and 107e in FIG. 12(a).
      <br/>
      Since this embodiment is obtained by changing the configuration of the assemblies of band-like divisions according to the tenth or eleventh embodiment, its configuration is described.
    </p>
    <p num="191">
      In FIG. 12(a), 107a to 107f are area parting lines of a composite diffraction element.
      <br/>
      Since this composite diffraction element has many characteristics in common with the element in FIG. 9(a), its configuration is omitted from FIG. 12(a) except for the area parting lines, and the configuration of assemblies of band-like divisions between the parting lines 107d and 107e that is different from that in the tenth and eleventh embodiments is shown in FIG. 12(b).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 12(b), 107a, 107d, 107e, and 107f are area parting lines of the composite diffraction element, and 108a to 108d are divided areas wherein the stripes inside each area conceptually show the direction of the diffraction grating.
      <br/>
      The areas 108a to 108d comprise four assemblies of band-like divisions formed by dividing the portion between the parting lines 107d and 107e into a plurality of band-like divisions parallel to the parting line 107a and further dividing these divisions into halves at the parting line 107f in such a way that the upper and lower arrays of band-like divisions at the parting line 107f are offset by a single division.
    </p>
    <p num="192">A fourth parting line according to this invention corresponds to the parting line 107f, and a fifth and a sixth parting lines according to this invention correspond to the parting lines 107d and 107e.</p>
    <p num="193">
      The operation of the optical head of the above configuration is common to the tenth and eleventh embodiments and is thus omitted.
      <br/>
      The following describes only the correspondence between the assemblies of band-like divisions between the parting lines 107d and 107e and the assemblies of band-like divisions in the two preceding embodiments.
    </p>
    <p num="194">
      For example, the areas 108a to 108d correspond to the areas 59a to 59d in FIG. 9(a).
      <br/>
      Diffracted beams through the areas 108a to 108d are incident on the predetermined light-receiving elements to provide signals as in the diffracted beams through the corresponding areas in the tenth or eleventh embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="195">
      Next, the effect of the above configuration of the assemblies of band-like divisions between the parting lines 107d and 107e is explained.
      <br/>
      If the band-like divisions are formed at a sufficiently small pitch so that this division substantially becomes equivalent to amplitude division, even the assemblies of band-like divisions according to the tenth or eleventh embodiment will pose no problem.
      <br/>
      In an actual configuration of an optical head, however, the distance between the composite diffraction element and the light-receiving elements may be limited to a small value to reduce the diameter of the luminous flux on the composite diffraction element, thereby preventing the size of the assemblies from being sufficiently reduced relative to the diameter of the luminous flux.
      <br/>
      FIG. 13(a) is a conceptual drawing of the assemblies of band-like divisions used to generate signals that are offset based on Equation 47, that is, the sum of the areas 59a and 59c and the sum of the areas 59b and 59d, according to the tenth embodiment.
      <br/>
      In general, the distribution of the amount of light in luminous fluxes incident on the composite diffraction element is not uniform and significantly varies in the direction perpendicular to the parting line 55a.
      <br/>
      If the composite diffraction element is composed of the assemblies of band-like divisions arranged at a larger pitch as in the conceptual drawing of FIG. 13(a), the asymmetry of the distribution of the amount of light in luminous fluxes relative to the parting line 55a results in the difference in the amount of light passing through these assemblies, thereby preventing an accurate offset based on Equation 47.
    </p>
    <p num="196">
      On the other hand, due to their layout having no gap in the direction perpendicular to the parting line 107a, the assemblies of band-like divisions according to this embodiment are not affected by the asymmetry of the distribution of the amount of light in luminous fluxes relative to the parting line 107a, as shown in FIG. 13(b).
      <br/>
      In addition, since the distribution of the amount of light in reflected luminous fluxes from the optical disc is generally symmetrical and is not very variable in the direction parallel to the parting line 107a, that is, the track direction, signals from the assemblies between the parting lines 107d and 107e can be accurately offset based on Equation 47.
      <br/>
      Thus, even a composite diffraction element composed of assemblies of band-like divisions arranged at a larger pitch can detect a tracking error signal intended by the tenth and eleventh embodiments.
    </p>
    <p num="197">In this configuration, as in the seventh embodiment, when the interval between the parting lines 107b and 107c of the composite diffraction element is designated as V, Equation 11 is desirably met, and when the interval between the parting lines 107d and 107e is indicated as W, Equation 36 is desirably met.</p>
    <p num="198">The above composite diffraction element according to this embodiment can provide the inherent performance and characteristics of the optical head according to the tenth and eleventh embodiments even if the optical head is miniaturized to reduce the distance between the composite diffraction element and the light-receiving elements.</p>
    <p num="199">Thirteenth Embodiment</p>
    <p num="200">
      FIG. 17 shows a configuration of an optical head according to a thirteenth embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      Since the configuration of this embodiment is similar to that of the above first embodiment, only different features are described.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 17, 71 is the composite diffraction element in each of the above embodiments according to this invention; 72 is a substrate on which the light-emitting element 4 and light-receiving elements are arranged as in the above embodiments of this invention; and 73 is a member formed of a rigid material such as metal or resin.
      <br/>
      The composite diffraction element 71 and substrate 72 are fixed together using the member 73.
    </p>
    <p num="201">The operation of the optical head of the above configuration according to this embodiment complies with each of the above embodiments, so its description is omitted.</p>
    <p num="202">
      The optical head according to this embodiment not only has the characteristics of the optical head according to each of the above embodiments, but is also characterized in that the composite diffraction element 71 and the substrate 72 on which the light-emitting and light-receiving elements are arranged are integrated into a single signal detection element.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to this embodiment, the optical head is composed of an optical system consisting of two optical parts, that is, an objective and a single signal detection element such as that described above, thereby facilitating the simplification of the assembly process and the miniaturization of the optical head.
    </p>
    <p num="203">
      In each of the above embodiments, the areas of the composite diffraction element correspond to the respective light-receiving elements receiving diffracted beams from the areas, as described above.
      <br/>
      Similar signal detection can be achieved with different combinations simply by changing the layout of the light-receiving elements and the diffraction grating pattern inside each area of the composite diffraction element.
    </p>
    <p num="204">In addition, a general principle is known that if interference fringes are generated by allowing two luminous fluxes, for example, a first and a second luminous fluxes to interfere with each other and when the luminous flux is incident that has the same convergence or divergence state as the first luminous flux, a diffraction element having such interference fringes as a diffraction grating pattern generates in the same direction as in the second luminous flux, a diffracted flux having the same wave front as in the second luminous flux.</p>
    <p num="205">Thus, in each of the above embodiments, diffracted luminous fluxes with little ray aberration are obtained by using as the diffraction grating pattern inside each area of the composite diffraction element, an interference fringe pattern generated on a surface in which the diffraction grating is formed, by means of two beams interference including a spherical wave converging toward the neighborhood of the light-emitting element and a spherical wave converging toward a predetermined position.</p>
    <p num="206">Alternatively, in each of the above embodiments, diffracted luminous fluxes with little ray aberration are obtained by using as the diffraction grating pattern inside each area of the composite diffraction element, an interference fringe pattern generated on a surface in which the diffraction grating is formed, by means of two beams interference including a spherical wave diverging from the neighborhood of the light-emitting element and a spherical wave diverging from a predetermined position.</p>
    <p num="207">In addition, using the above optical head according to this invention, a control circuit for providing control based on signals from the optical head, and a drive section for executing mechanical driving based on control signals from the control circuit, a more excellent information recording and reproduction apparatus, for example, a more excellent optical disc apparatus can be realized.</p>
    <p num="208">As described above, this invention can provide a stable optical head of a simple configuration that can reduce an offset in the tracking error signal caused by the movement of the objective in the tracking direction or the inclination of the information-recording medium in the radial direction.</p>
