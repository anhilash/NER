      <br/>
      Bowl-shaped polymer particles characterised by having a bowl-like shape as is formed by partly cutting along a plane each spherical hollow polymer particle having a void in the inside, and in which the cross-section perpendicular to the cut plane and passing through the center of the particle has a shape as is formed by partly cutting a double circle along a straight line, and the lengths H of the perpendiculars from the outer arc of the double circle in the cross-section to the straight line have a maximum value Hmax equal to or larger than the radius of the outer circle of the double circle.
      <br/>
      The bowl-shaped polymer particles have a multi-layer structure, and are produced by multi-stage polymerization in which monomer mixtures are successively polymerized in a manner such that the proportion of a monomer having an acidic group gradationally decreases and by treating the resultant polymer with a base.
      <br/>
      The bowl-shaped polymer particles are useful as a heat-insulating material, organic pigment, or opacifying agent, and especially as a heat-insulating interlayer to be formed in a thermal recording material.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to bowl-shaped polymer particles; an aqueous dispersion of polymer particles capable of, when it is dried, forming the bowl-shaped polymer particles; and processes for producing the bowl-shaped polymer particles and the aqueous polymer particle dispersion.</p>
    <p num="2">The bowl-shaped polymer particles of the present invention are used as a heat-insulating material, an organic pigment and an opacifying agent, and as ingredients to be incorporated in a material for forming a heat-insulating intermediate layer of a thermal recording material, an aqueous coating composition, a coating color for paper, and others.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">It has been hitherto known that hollow polymer particles cause irregular reflection of irradiated light due to the presence of a void in the interior thereof, and thus, when the hollow polymer particles are coated on a material, whiteness of the material is enhanced and the material is made opaque.</p>
    <p num="4">It is considered that, as the diameter of the hollow polymer particles becomes large, the opacifying effect becomes prominent.</p>

      Polymer particles having a special shape, other than the hollow polymer particles, also are known as exhibiting an opacifying effect.
      <br/>
      For example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (hereinafter abbreviated to "JP-A") No. H5-222108, polymer particles having at least one through-hole extending from the particle surface to the interior thereof, which is formed when the particles are dried, and a process for producing the polymers are described.
      <br/>
      It is described therein that the polymer particles are usable as a coating composition and an organic pigment for paper coating color.
      <br/>
      However, the particle size of the polymer particles, produced by this process, are small, i.e., at most about 0.2  MU m, and thus, the opacifying effect of the pigment is poor.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A thermal recording material has been proposed in JP-A H2-164580, which has a heat-insulating intermediate layer between a support and a thermal recording layer, wherein the intermediate layer contains porous and non-spherical hollow polymer particles having undulations on the surface which are formed by allowing hollow polymer particles to shrink.
      <br/>
      These non-spherical hollow polymer particles exhibit good thermal response, but have poor adhesion between the thermal recording layer and the support.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another thermal recording material has been proposed in JP-A H5-573, which has a heat-insulating intermediate layer between a support and a thermal recording layer, wherein the intermediate layer contains spherical or ellipsoidal plastic hollow particles.
      <br/>
      The plastic hollow particles are fine foamed plastic hollow particles having an average particle diameter of 2.0 to 20  MU m, preferably 3 to 10  MU m. It is however difficult to prepare fine foamed plastic hollow particles which are uniform and have a narrow particle size distribution.
    </p>
    <p num="8">A further thermal recording material has been proposed in JP-A H2-57382, which has a heat-insulating intermediate layer between a support and a thermal recording layer, wherein the intermediate layer contains fine hollow polymer particles having a particle diameter of not larger than 5  MU m, preferably 0.1 to 3  MU m. These hollow polymer particles exhibit a poor effect for enhancement of thermal response, and further have problems of causing sticking and deposition of tailings on a thermal head.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Emulsified vinyl polymer particles have been proposed in JP-A-H2-14222, which have a flat shape, and at least one major surface of which is concave.
      <br/>
      It is described therein that these polymer particles are used as an additive for a paint, a paper coating color, or a coating color for information recording paper and other materials.
      <br/>
      It is however indispensable for the preparation of the polymer particles to conduct emulsion polymerization using a non-aqueous organic solvent such as an aliphatic hydrocarbon, and, after the completion of polymerization, to remove the organic solvent from the reaction system.
      <br/>
      Due to the flat shape, the polymer particles exhibit poor opacifying effect, and, where they are used for a thermal recording paper, they exhibit a poor heat-insulating effect.

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">
      I.
      <br/>
      Bowl-Shaped Polymer Particle
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The bowl-shaped polymer particle of the present invention has a shape as is obtained by partly cutting along a plane approximately spherical hollow polymer particle having a void (i.e., vacant space) in the inside.
      <br/>
      A cross-section perpendicular to the cut plane and passing through the center of the particle has a shape, as illustrated in FIG. 1, as is formed by partly cutting a double circle along a straight line "m".
      <br/>
      In the cross-section shown in FIG. 1, among lengths H of the perpendiculars drawn from arbitrary points on the outer arc of the cross-section to the straight line m, the maximum length Hmax is equal to or larger than the radius (i.e., half of the diameter D) of the outer circle "p" of the double circle.
      <br/>
      In other words, the outer diameter of the bowl-shaped polymer particle is approximately the same as the outer diameter of a spherical hollow polymer particle as immediately before the formation of bowl-shape.
      <br/>
      The shape of the bowl-shaped polymer particle is a half of the spherical hollow polymer particle as immediately before the formation of bowl-shape, or larger than the half, namely, the shape is intermediate between a hemisphere and a sphere.
      <br/>
      Thus, the ratio of the outer diameter "D" of the bowl-shaped polymer particle to the maximum height Hmax is larger than 1, and equal to 2 or smaller (i.e., 1&lt;D/Hmax &lt;= 2).
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The wall of the bowl-shaped polymer particle becomes thick and inwardly overhang to a small degree.
      <br/>
      The wall thickness of the bowl-shaped polymer particle is about two times of that of the hollow polymer particles before the formation of the bowl-shape.
      <br/>
      The wall thickness in the vicinity of brim of the bowl-shaped polymer particle is about 10% to about 30% of the outer diameter D of the particle.
      <br/>
      The bowl-shaped polymer particle may either have a thin fattened void (i.e., a very thin vacant space) originating from the void in the inside of the hollow polymer particle before the formation of bowl-shape, or be solid without any vacant space.
    </p>
    <p num="29">The average maximum diameter of the bowl-shaped polymer particle is generally in the range of 0.3 to 5  MU m, preferably 0.5 to 3  MU m. The ratio of the average outer diameter of the opening brim (i.e., diameter of the brim including the wall thickness) of the bowl-shaped polymer particle to the average maximum diameter of the particle is generally in the range of 25 to 100%, preferably 60 to 95%.</p>
    <p num="30">II. Production of Bowl-Shaped Polymer</p>
    <p num="31">The bowl-shaped polymer particle of the present invention has a wall which is usually of a multi-layer structure, and is made by a multi-stage polymerization process comprising the following steps (1) to (7).</p>
    <p num="32">(1) A monomer mixture comprising 30 to 65% by weight of an acidic group-containing monomer and 70 to 35% by weight of a monomer copolymerizable therewith is copolymerized to prepare a nucleus polymer particle.</p>
    <p num="33">(2) A monomer mixture comprising 10 to 35% by weight of an acidic group-containing monomer and 90 to 65% by weight of a monomer copolymerizable therewith is copolymerized in the presence of the nucleus polymer particle, prepared in step (1), to prepare a core polymer particle substantially surrounding the nucleus polymer particle, wherein the content of the acidic group-containing monomer units in the core polymer particle is equal to or smaller than the content of the acid group-containing monomer units in the nucleus polymer particle.</p>
    <p num="34">(3) A monomer mixture comprising 1 to 12% by weight of an acidic group-containing monomer and 99 to 88% by weight of a monomer copolymerizable therewith is copolymerized in the presence of the nucleus/core polymer particle, prepared in step (2), to form at least one intermediate polymer layer which substantially surrounds the nucleus/core polymer particle;</p>
    <p num="35">(4) An aromatic vinyl monomer is polymerized alone or a monomer mixture comprising up to 0.5% by weight of an acidic group-containing monomer and at least 99.5% by weight of an aromatic vinyl monomer copolymerizable therewith is copolymerized, in the presence of the polymer particle which is prepared in step (3) and comprising the intermediate polymer layer substantially surrounding the nucleus/core polymer particle, to prepare an outer polymer layer which substantially surrounds the polymer particle prepared in step (3).</p>
    <p num="36">(5) A base is added to an aqueous dispersion of the polymer particle, which is prepared in step (4) and has a multi-layer structure comprising at least four layers, to adjust the pH value of the aqueous polymer dispersion to at least 7.</p>
    <p num="37">(6) If desired, the pH value of the aqueous polymer particle dispersion is adjusted below 7, and then, an aromatic vinyl monomer alone or a monomer mixture comprising at least 90% by weight of an aromatic vinyl monomer and not larger than 10% by weight of a monomer copolymerizable therewith is added, to polymerize the aromatic vinyl monomer or copolymerize the monomer mixture in the presence of the polymer particle with the multi-layer structure, prepared in step (5), to form an outermost polymer layer surrounding the outer polymer layer prepared in step (4).</p>
    <p num="38">(7) The thus-prepared aqueous polymer dispersion is dried.</p>
    <p num="39">
      An assembly of multiplicity of bowl-shaped polymer particles with wall having a multi-layer structure is made by the above-mentioned process.
      <br/>
      The assembly of the bowl-shaped polymer particles usually contains smaller than about 20% by weight of polymer particles having other shapes, which do not satisfy the above-mentioned definition for the bowl-shaped polymer particle.
    </p>
    <p num="40">The above-mentioned multi-stage polymerization process for producing the bowl-shaped polymer particles with wall having a multi-layer structure will now be described in detail.</p>
    <p num="41">Preparation of Nucleus Polymer Particle �Step (1)�</p>
    <p num="42">
      The nucleus polymer particle is prepared by copolymerizing a monomer mixture comprising 30 to 65% by weight, preferably 30 to 55% by weight, of an acidic group-containing monomer and 70 to 35% by weight, preferably 70 to 45% by weight, of a monomer copolymerizable therewith.
      <br/>
      If the amount of an acidic group-containing monomer is too small, a base does not easily penetrate the polymer particle in the base-treating step (5) and it is difficult to form a void within the polymer particle, and consequently, the bowl-shaped polymer particle is difficult to prepare.
      <br/>
      In contrast, if the amount of an acidic group-containing monomer is too large, the nucleus polymer particle has a tendency of shifting from the center to the outside of the intermediate polymer layer and the outer polymer layer, and the polymerization stability becomes poor.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The acidic group-containing monomer used herein means a monomer having a functional group exhibiting acidity, and, as specific examples thereof, there can be mentioned ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, cinnamic acid, itaconic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid and butenetricarboxylic acid; monoalkyl esters of unsaturated dicarboxylic acids such as monoethyl itaconate, monobutyl fumarate and monobutyl maleate; and sulfonic acid group-containing monomers such as styrenesulfonic acid.
      <br/>
      These acidic group-containing monomers may be used either alone or as a combination of two or more thereof.
      <br/>
      With a monomer having a strong acidity, the acidic group tends to shift to the outside of the polymer particle, and it becomes difficult that the core polymer and the intermediate polymer layer cover the nucleus polymer particle, and consequently, the bowl-shaped polymer particle becomes difficult to prepare.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Of the acidic group-containing monomers, monocarboxylic acids and monoesters of dicarboxylic acids are preferable.
      <br/>
      Methacrylic acid is most preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      As specific examples of the monomer copolymerizable with the acidic group-containing monomers, there can be mentioned aromatic vinyl monomers such as styrene,  ALPHA -methylstyrene, p-methylstyrene and halogenated styrenes; acrylic acid esters and methacrylic acid esters such as methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 2-ethylexyl methacrylate, lauryl acrylate, lauryl methacrylate, glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate; acrylamide, methacrylamide and their derivatives such as acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-methylolacrylamide, N-methylol-methacrylamide, N-butoxymethylacrylamide and N-butoxymethyl-methacrylamide; diene monomers such as butadiene and isoprene; a vinyl ester of carboxylic acids such as vinyl acetate; vinyl halides such as vinyl chloride; vinylidene halides such as vinylidene chloride; and vinylpyridine.
      <br/>
      Of these, acrylic acid esters and methacrylic acid esters are preferable.
      <br/>
      These monomers may be used either alone or as a combination of two or more thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      If desired, a cross-linking monomers such as divinylbenzene, diallyl phthalate, allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, ethylene glycol diacrylate and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate may be used.
      <br/>
      However, it should be noted that, when a cross-linking monomer is sued in a salient amount, the bowl-shaped polymer particle is difficult to prepare, and thus, the amount thereof should be within the range wherein stable voids can be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      As the polymerization procedure for preparing the nucleus polymer particle, an emulsion polymerization procedure is usually employed.
      <br/>
      But, phase inversion may be employed for inverting a polymer prepared by other polymerization procedure into a latex.
      <br/>
      The polymerization may be carried out by a batchwise, semi-continuous or continuous polymerization process.
      <br/>
      The polymerization temperature may be either high or low.
      <br/>
      The polymerization pressure and time are not particularly limited, and conventional conditions may be employed.
      <br/>
      Known auxiliaries may be used, which include emulsifiers, polymerization initiators, chelating agents, electrolytes, molecular weight modifiers and surface active agents.
      <br/>
      A seed is preferably used for the preparation of the nucleus polymer particle for easily controlling the size of the nucleus polymer particle.
      <br/>
      The composition of seed is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      The conversion of monomers in the polymerization is usually at least 90%, and preferably at least 97%.
      <br/>
      The composition of the resulting copolymer is approximately the same as the composition of the monomer mixture used.
    </p>
    <p num="48">Preparation of Core Polymer Particle �Step (2)�</p>
    <p num="49">
      The core polymer particle is obtained by copolymerizing a monomer mixture comprising 10 to 35% by weight, preferably 15 to 35% by weight, of an acidic group-containing monomer and 90 to 65% by weight, preferably 85 to 65% by weight, of a monomer copolymerizable therewith in the presence of the nucleus polymer particle, prepared in step (1).
      <br/>
      The content of the acidic group-containing monomer units in the core polymer particle should be equal to or smaller than the content of the acid group-containing monomer units in the nucleus polymer particle.

      If the content of the acidic group-containing monomer units is too small, a base does not easily penetrate the polymer particle in the base-treating step (5) and the bowl-shaped polymer particle is difficult to prepare.
      <br/>
      In contrast, if the content of the acidic monomer units is too large, the core polymer particle has a tendency of shifting from the center to the outside of the intermediate polymer layer and the outer polymer layer, the stability of as-produced polymer becomes poor and the bowl-shaped polymer particle is difficult to prepare.

      The monomer mixture for forming the core polymer particle is used in an amount such that the amount of the nucleus polymer particle is in the range of 1 to 25 parts by weight, preferably 3 to 20 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the core polymer particle.
      <br/>
      If the relative amount of the nucleus polymer particle is too large, the bowl-shaped polymer particle is difficult to prepare.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the relative amount of the nucleus polymer particle is too small, the polymerization stability is reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The thus-prepared nucleus/core polymer particle has a particle diameter in the range of preferably 150 to 500 nm, and more preferably 200 to 400 nm.

      When the polymer particle size is smaller, the bowl-shaped polymer particle is difficult to prepare.
      <br/>
      When the polymer particle size is larger, the polymerization stability becomes poor.
    </p>
    <p num="54">Formation of Intermediate Polymer Layer �Step (3)�</p>
    <p num="55">
      The intermediate polymer layer is formed by copolymerizing a monomer mixture comprising 1 to 12% by weight, preferably 2 to 10% by weight, more preferably 3 to 9% by weight, of an acidic group-containing monomer and 99 to 88% by weight, preferably 98 to 90% by weight, more preferably 97 to 91% by weight, of a monomer copolymerizable therewith in the presence of the nucleus/core polymer particle.
      <br/>

      The outer polymer layer is formed on the periphery of the intermediate polymer layer formed in step (3), and substantially surrounds the nucleus/core/intermediate layer polymer particle.

      A base is added to an aqueous dispersion, such as a latex, of the polymer particle, prepared in step (4) and having a multi-layer structure comprising the nucleus polymer particle, the core polymer particle, the intermediate polymer layer and the outer polymer layer, to adjust the pH value of the aqueous polymer dispersion to at least 7, whereby a void (i.e., a vacant space) is formed within the polymer particle.

      To neutralize the acidic groups within the polymer particle by the addition of a base to the aqueous polymer particle dispersion, a time is required for which a base is diffused inside the polymer particle.

      Therefore, after the addition of a base, stirring is preferably carried out for a sufficient time.
      <br/>
      The temperature at which the base treatment is carried out is preferably such that the polymer particle is softened thoroughly.

      It is possible that the stability of the aqueous dispersion is reduced by the addition of a base.

      If the base treatment is carried out in the presence of an organic solvent, especially a non-polymerizable aliphatic hydrocarbon, the finally produced polymer particles have a flat shape rather than a bowl shape.

      After the base treatment, or the acid treatment, if desired, an aromatic vinyl monomer or a monomer mixture comprising at least 90% by weight of an aromatic vinyl monomer and not larger than 10% by weight of a monomer copolymerizable therewith is added to polymerize the aromatic vinyl monomer or copolymerize the monomer mixture in the presence of the polymer particle with the multi-layer structure, to form an outermost polymer layer surrounding the outer polymer layer of the polymer particle.
      <br/>
      By the polymerization of an aromatic vinyl monomer or a monomer mixture predominantly comprised of an aromatic vinyl monomer, an outermost polymer layer having a high glass transition temperature (Tg) is formed, and thus, the opacifying effect and heat-insulating effect of the hollow polymer particle are enhanced and melt-adhesion of polymer articles is prevented.
      <br/>
      As mentioned above, the monomer or monomer mixture for forming the outermost layer may be added to the aqueous polymer particle dispersion in the base treatment step to promote the diffusion of a base within the polymer particle.
      <br/>
      As the monomer used for copolymerization in combination with an aromatic vinyl monomer, an acidic group-containing monomer is preferably used.

      The acidic group-containing monomer can be added to the aqueous polymer particle dispersion for the purpose of treating the polymer particle with an acid in the acid treatment step, as explained as for the acid treatment step.

    <p num="87">
      By the formation of the outermost polymer layer, hollow polymer particles having at least one void are obtained.

      At the stage of completion of polymerization, the void within the hollow polymer particles is filled with the aqueous liquid.
      <br/>
      When the hollow polymer particles are dried to remove the aqueous liquid, bowl-shaped polymer particles can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      It is presumed that, with a progress of drying and a removal of the aqueous liquid within the polymer particle, the outer shell forming the hollow polymer particle is caved in an inwardly folded manner whereby the entire polymer particle becomes bowl-shaped.

      More specifically, with a progress of drying, the degree of caving of the outer shell progresses and the volume of vacant space within the polymer particle is gradually reduced, and finally, the volume of vacant space reaches zero or in the vicinity thereof whereby the entire polymer particle becomes bowl-shaped.
      <br/>
      The drying can be conducted either by directly drying the aqueous dispersion (i.e., latex), for example, by spray drying, or by coagulating the aqueous dispersion, for example, by a conventional coagulating procedure, to separate the solid hollow polymer particle, followed by drying the separated polymer particle.
      <br/>
      By drying relatively rapidly, a solid bowl-shaped polymer particle with no vacant space within the particle can be obtained.
