    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="4">
      The ability of a host to resist infection with a wide range of viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens is strongly influenced by genetic factors (reviewed by Skamene, 1985, Prog.
      <br/>
      Leukoc. Biol. 3: 111-559; Skamene and Pietrangeli, 1991, Curr.
      <br/>
      Opin. Immunol. 3, 511-517).
      <br/>
      A clear manifestation of differential resistance or susceptibility of human populations in endemic areas of disease and during epidemics has been observed in the case of mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae).
      <br/>
      Epidemiological studies of tuberculosis provide evidence that resistance to tuberculosis in humans is genetically controlled.
      <br/>
      The problem of the extend to which genetic factors enter into susceptibility to tuberculosis is one of the oldest in human genetics (Neel et al., 1954, In Human Heredity, The University of Chicago Press, p. 292).
      <br/>
      Infection by M. tuberculosis results in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from a change in skin test sensitivity to purified protein derivative to fully developed pulmonary disease which may cause death if the infection is left untreated.
      <br/>
      Although the specific genes involved have not been identified, recent studies suggest that the basis for this genetic distinction resides in a differential capacity of host macrophages to kill phagocytized tubercle bacilli.
      <br/>
      A similar situation exists for leprosy where increased prevalence among certain ethnic groups points to the role of genetic factors in susceptibility to leprosy (reviewed by Schurr et al., 1991, Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 44: 4-11).
      <br/>
      Moreover, a two-stage model for genetic control of innate susceptibility to leprosy has been suggested: susceptibility to disease per se appears to be determined by the expression of a single recessive autosomal gene, while the progression of the disease and the type of leprosy ultimately developed (mild tuberculoid or severe lepromatous) are associated with genes of the major histocompatibility complex (Schurr et al., 1991, Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 44: 4-11).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the mouse, innate resistance or susceptibility t6 infection with several mycobacterial species such as Mycobacterium lepraemurium, Mycobacterium bovis (BCG), and Mycobacterium intracellulare is under remarkably similar genetic control (reviewed by Blackwell et al., 1991, Immunol.
      <br/>
      Lett. 30: 241-248; Skamene and Pietrangeli, 1991, Curr.
      <br/>
      Opin. Immunol. 3: 511-517).
      <br/>
      In inbred mouse strains, infection with BCG is biphasic, with an early non-immune phase (0-3 weeks) characterized by rapid proliferation of the bacteria in reticuloendothelium (RE) organs (liver and spleen) of susceptible strains and absence of bacterial growth in resistance strains.
      <br/>
      The late phase (3-6 weeks) is associated with specific immune response, leading either to complete clearance of the bacterial load or to persistent infection in the RE organs of the susceptible strains.
      <br/>
      While the late phase of infection is under the control of genes linked to the major histocompatibility complex, the difference in innate susceptibility detected in the early phase is controlled by the expression of a single dominant chromosome 1 gene designated Bcg, which is present in two allelic forms in inbred strains, Bcgr (resistant, dominant) and Bcgs (susceptible, recessive) (reviewed by Blackwell et al., 1991, Immunol.
      <br/>
      Lett. 30: 241-248; Skamene and Pietrangeli, 1991, Curr.
      <br/>
      Opin. Immunol. 3: 511-517).
      <br/>
      The Bcg locus is inseparable by genetic mapping from two other genes, known as Ity and Lsh, which together control natural resistance to infection with antigenitically and taxonomically unrelated intracellular parasites, including Salmonella typhimurium and Leishmania donovani.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The cellular compartment responsible for the phenotypic expression of the gene is bone marrow-derived and radio resistant and can be inactivated by chronic exposure to silica, a macrophage poison (Gros et al., 1983, J. Immunol. 131: 1966-1973).
      <br/>
      Moreover, explanted macrophages from Bcgr and Bcgs mice express a differential capacity to restrict the growth of ingested BCG (Stach et al., 1984, J. Immunol. 132: 888-892), M. intracellulare (Goto et al., 1989, Immunogenetics 30: 218-221), Mycobacterium smegmatis (Denis et al., 1990, J. Leukoc. Biol. 47: 25-30), S. typhimurium (Lissner et al., 1983, J. Immunol. 131: 3006-3013) and L. donovani (Crocker et al., 1984, Infect.
      <br/>
      Immunol. 43: 1033-1040) in vitro, indicating that this cell type expresses the genetic difference.
      <br/>
      The mechanism by which Bcgr macrophages exert enhanced cytocidal or cytostatic activity is not known, but they appear superior to Bcgs macrophages in the expression of surface markers (Ia and Acm-1 antigen) associated with the state of activation (Buschman et al., 1989, Res.
      <br/>
      Immunol. 140: 793-797) and the production of toxic oxygen and nitrogen radicals in response to secondary stimuli such as interferon  GAMMA  and BCG infection, both in vivo and in vitro (reviewed by Blackwell et al., 1991, Immunol.
      <br/>
      Lett. 30: 241-248; Skamene and Pietrangeli, 1991, Curr.
      <br/>
      Opin. Immunol. 3: 511-517).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Improper activation of the mononuclear phagocyte system can have profound deleterious consequences for the host, including the establishment of chronic infections, such as lepromatous leprosy and tuberculosis (Binford et al., 1982, J. Am. Med. Assoc. 247: 2283-2292).
      <br/>
      Additionally, Bcgr macrophages are more efficient in antigen presentation than their Bcgs counterparts (Denis et al., 1988, J. Immunol. 140: 2395-2400; ibid., 141: 3988-3993).
      <br/>
      Thus, through a more efficient presentation of self-antigens, Bcgr macrophages might thus be more likely to trigger an inflammatory response.
      <br/>
      Moreover, inappropriate regulation of activation, either by excess stimuli or insufficient suppression, can lead through inflammation, to extensive tissue damage such as in acute lung injury (Worthen et al., 1987, Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. 136: 19-28).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Although the mouse model has been instrumental in the elucidation of the intricacies of the immune system in humans, it does not serve as a good model for the study of tuberculosis and tuberculosis resistance in humans.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the mouse will only generally develop the pulmonary disease upon infection with very large doses (non physiological) of mycobacteria.
      <br/>
      At present the best animal models for tuberculosis are rabbits and hamsters.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The problems of sensitivity to infection by antigenically unrelated intracellular parasites, such as mycobacterium or Salmonella are not restricted to humans and mice.
      <br/>
      The meat and poultry industries, for example, suffer from recurrent infection problems linked to a number of such intracellular parasites.
      <br/>
      The major economical consequences derived from Salmonella infections in chicken is a case in point.
      <br/>
      Importantly, a genetic basis for the resistance/susceptibility phenotype to such intracellular parasites in a number of these other animal models has been suggested.
    </p>
    <p num="10">In spite of considerable interest in the study of natural resistance to infection with intracellular parasites its genetic basis remains unknown.</p>
    <p num="11">
      It would be highly desirable to identify the gene responsible for innate resistance to a wide variety of antigenically unrelated intracellular parasites including mycobacterial species, as well as to identify and characterize the protein encoded therefrom.
      <br/>
      It would also be highly desirable to identify the mouse Bcg gene and its encoded protein in order to understand the biochemical events leading to normal or aberrant macrophage activation, including acquisition of antimicrobial functions and the inflammatory response.
      <br/>
      It would still be highly desirable to identify the human gene and its encoded protein, responsible for this innate resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="12">It would further be desirable to obtain a mouse model for the study of tuberculosis.</p>
    <p num="13">In addition, it would be immensely useful to be able to identify individuals or animals which are susceptible to infection with antigenically unrelated intracellular parasites such as mycobacteria.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">In humans, natural resistance or susceptibility to infection with mycobacteria such as M. tuberculosis and M. leprae, or Leishmania donovani and Salmonella typhimurium, have been shown to be under similar genetic control to that observed in inbred mice and directed by Bcg.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The present invention seeks to provide a nucleic acid segment isolated from an animal source comprising at least a portion of the gene responsible for natural resistance to infection with Mycobacteria and/or Leishmania and/or Salmonella (Nramp).
      <br/>
      The Nramp nucleic acid segment can be isolated using a method similar to those described herein, or using another method.
      <br/>
      In addition such nucleic acid can be synthesized chemically.
      <br/>
      Having the Nramp nucleic acid segment of the present invention, parts thereof or oligos derived therefrom, other Nramp sequences from other animal sources using methods described herein or other methods can be isolated.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The invention also seeks to provide prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression vectors harboring the Nramp nucleic acid segment of the invention in an expressible from, and cells transformed with same.
      <br/>
      Such cells can serve a variety of purposes such as in vitro models for the function of Nramp as well as for screening pharmaceutical compounds that could regulate the expression of the gene or the activity of the protein encoded therefrom.
      <br/>
      For example, such a cell, expressing a DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in macrophage function could serve to screen for pharmaceutical compounds that regulate macrophage function, and wherein the macrophage function comprises response to infection, killing of extracellular or intracellular targets and inflammatory response.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      An expression vector harboring the Nramp nucleic acid segment or part thereof, can be used to obtain substantially pure protein.
      <br/>
      Well-known vectors can be used to obtain large amounts of the protein which can then be purified by standard biochemical methods based on charge, molecular weight, solubility or affinity of the protein or alternatively, the protein can be purified by using gene fusion techniques such as GST fusion, which permits the purification of the protein of interest on a gluthathion column.
      <br/>
      Other types of purification methods or fusion proteins could also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Antibodies both polyclonal and monoclonal can be prepared from the protein encoded by the Nramp nucleic acid segment of the invention.
      <br/>
      Such antibodies can be used for a variety of purposes including affinity purification of the Nramp protein and diagnosis of the susceptibility/resistance predisposition to infection with a wide range of antigenically unrelated intracellular parasites.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The Nramp nucleic acid segment, parts thereof or oligonucleotides derived therefrom, can further be used to identify differences between individuals or animals that are susceptible or resistant to Mycobacterium species and the like.
      <br/>
      These nucleic acids can be additionally used to study the potentiation of macrophage resistance in an animal model, whether mouse or otherwise, following infection or challenge with Mycobacterium species and the like.
      <br/>
      The Nramp sequences can further be used to obtain animal models for the study of tuberculosis and the like.
      <br/>
      The functional activity of the Nramp protein encoded by these nucleic acids, whether native or mutated, can be tested in interspecies in vitro or in vivo models.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      More specifically, the invention seeks to provide human Nramp and mouse Nramp nucleic acids and sequences hybridizing thereto under high stringency conditions.
      <br/>
      The human Nramp-1 can be used in a DNA-based diagnostic assay to identify these individuals in the population who are at risk for the above mentioned types of infections.
      <br/>
      The human Nramp-1 DNA-based diagnostic assay can be used to identify individuals innately susceptible or resistant to BCG infection in populations where vaccination programs using BCG recombinant vaccines and prophylaxis of the above mentioned diseases are planned.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Further, the present invention seeks to provide the use of the Nramp protein as a pharmacological target for modulating macrophage function, including nonspecific host defense against infectious (intracellular) and tumor (extracellular) targets.</p>
    <p num="22">
      In general, the present invention relates to the determination that natural resistance to infection with intracellular parasites is conferred in mice by a gene, designated Nramp, in which mutations are associated with susceptibility to infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, leprosy, salmonellosis and leshmaniasis in mice.
      <br/>
      The Nramp gene has been shown to regulate the growth of Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) and other taxonomically and antigenically infectious agents in the mouse.
      <br/>
      The sequence of the 2.48 Kb mouse Nramp cDNA clone, as is its deduced amino acid sequence are disclosed herein.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In addition, the mouse Nramp cDNA clone was used to probe a human cDNA library under non-stringent conditions, and surprisingly, permitted to show that not one, but at least two Nramp genes are expressed in humans.
      <br/>
      More particularly, one of these two human Nramp cDNA clones, was shown to be the homolog of mouse Nramp, and designated human Nramp-1.
      <br/>
      The sequence of the human Nramp-1 cDNA clone, as is its deduced amino acid sequence are also disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      The second members (Nramp-2) of mouse Nramp and human Nramp families have now been identified and characterized.
      <br/>
      Their nucleic acid sequences and deduced amino acid sequences are disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      It has now been surprisingly recognized that the Nramp genes are highly conserved between human and mouse.
      <br/>
      Further, this homology has now been unexpectedly shown to also be found with Nramp genes of other animals like rabbit, swine and even to chicken.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the present invention also relates to the isolation of Nramp genes from different animals, through the use of the nucleic acid sequences and the methods of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Although the mouse model is not a very good animal model for tuberculosis in man, it has been traditionally used and continues to be used for immunological studies in general, and is a very important and relevant model for human mechanisms of defense based on the RE organs ("The cellular Basis of the immune response, An approach to immunology" Second Edition, 1981 E.

      That the mouse model could serve as a valid model for human mechanisms of defense has been substantiated by the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, according to the invention, the expression of Nramp-1 in mice is restricted to RE organs and further restricted to the macrophage compartment.
      <br/>
      The expression of human Nramp-1 is also restricted to RE organs and enriched in macrophage populations derived from these tissues.
      <br/>
      In addition, a very high sequence homology is observed between human and mouse Nramp (93% homology at the amino acid level for Nramp-1), strongly suggesting that these two Nramp proteins share the same function.
      <br/>
      Further, Nramp gene families are present in both mouse and human, the different Nramp genes identified are located on synthenic or homologous chromosomes, and they are surrounded by the same markers.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to the present invention the mouse model can serve as an animal model for tuberculosis in man.
    </p>
    <p num="25">In particular, the invention relates to a nucleic acid segment isolated from an animal source comprising a sequence encoding Nramp-1, a transmembrane protein displaying homology to nitrate transporters, involved in macrophage function, wherein macrophage function comprises response to infection, killing of extracellular or intracellular targets and inflammatory response.</p>
    <p num="26">The invention further relates to a substantially pure animal protein involved in macrophage function, wherein said macrophage function comprises response to infection, killing of extracellular or intracellular targets and inflammatory response.</p>
    <p num="27">More particularly, the invention relates to a method for identifying an alteration in a Nramp sequence encoding a protein conferring innate susceptibility or resistance to antigenically unrelated intracellular parasites wherein said determination of the presence of the alteration comprises hybridization of a sample of DNA or RNA from said animal with at least one sequence-specific oligonucleotide.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The identification of a difference between a resistant or a susceptible animal, such as a polymorphism, can be instrumental in the pinpointing of a specific alteration such as a point mutation.
      <br/>
      The identification of a point mutation associated with susceptibility can lead to a diagnostic assay to screen large populations in endemic areas of disease.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Moreover, the invention relates to a method for the isolation of a cDNA or gene using a positional cloning approach, wherein said gene product is unknown and a reliable in vitro assay for gene function is unavailable.</p>

      The designation Nramp as used in the present specification and claims refers to Nramp cDNAs or genes in animals in general.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the Nramp designation refers to genes encoding proteins which are homologous but not necessarily involved directly in natural resistance to infection to antigenically unrelated parasites.
      <br/>
      The numbering of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences and of the transmembrane domains and other landmarks of the proteins are based on the original sequences.
      <br/>
      Due to the identification of a further exon in mouse Nramp-1 for example, TM2 should actually be TM4 and Gly105 should actually be Gly169.
      <br/>
      As intended herein, humans are understood as being generally covered by the term animal.
      <br/>
      Nramp is intended to cover for example the NRAMP and Nramp designations, generally used for human and mouse, respectively.
      <br/>
      The designation functional variant is to be interpreted as meaning that the variant retains the biological activity of the protein from which it might originate.

    <heading>MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="36">
      In the absence of either a known gene product or a reliable in vitro assay for gene function, a positional cloning approach to isolate the Bcg gene was chosen.
      <br/>
      Bcg maps on the proximal portion of mouse chromosome 1, close to the villin (Vil) gene (Malo et al., 1993, Genomics 16: 655-663).
      <br/>
      Using known marker loci and new anonymous probes obtained from a chromosome 1 micro-dissected library or generated by chromosome walking, a high resolution linkage map of mouse chromosome 1 was constructed (Malo et al., 1993, Genomics 16: 655-663).
      <br/>
      This mouse chromosome 1 segment of 30 cM overlapping Bcg, was found to be syntenic with a portion of human chromosome 2q in a segment delineated by loci COL3A1 (2q31-2q32.3) and COL6A3 (2q37) (Malo et al., 1993, Genomics 16: 655-663).
      <br/>
      After delineation of the maximal genetic and physical intervals defining the boundaries of the Bcg candidate gene region (Malo et al., 1993, Genomics 16: 655-663, and ibid 17: 667-675, respectively), a large segment of this domain was isolated in yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC), cosmid, and bacteriophage clones.
      <br/>
      This cloned genomic domain was analyzed for the presence of transcription units, and this eventually lead to the identification of a candidate gene for mouse Bcg.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Using the mouse Nramp cDNA (MNramp), it has been surprisingly discovered that at least two (2) Nramp genes are present and expressed, and thus, that in humans, a gene family of Nramp genes exists.
      <br/>
      Consequently, in order to identify the human counterpart of mouse Nramp, both potential human homologs of the mouse Nramp gene (HNramp-1 and HNramp-2) had to be analyzed.
      <br/>
      It now has been surprisingly discovered that mouse also contain at least two (2) Nramp genes.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, using mouse Nramp and/or human Nramp probes on Zoo blots under low stringency hybridization conditions (FIG. 2), that chicken and pig might contain a minimum of three (3) Nramp genes.
      <br/>
      The possibility that a third Nramp gene be identified in human and mouse thus remains and has been suggested by Dosik et al., 1994 (Mamm. Genome 5:458).
    </p>
    <p num="38">I. GENOMIC DNA CLONING IN THE VICINITY OF Bcg</p>
    <p num="39">
      The linkage analysis in back-crossed mice and recombinant inbred strains was previously carried out and established at 0.3 cM the maximum genetic interval delineating Bcg (Malo et al., 1993, Genomics 16: 655-663).
      <br/>
      This interval includes the gene for the cytoskeleton protein villin (Vil) and the anonymous microdissected probe  LAMBDA Mm1C165, neither of which shows recombination with Bcg in 1424 meioses tested.
      <br/>
      This maximum genetic interval was defined by single crossovers detected between D1Mcg105 and Bcg on the proximal side (1683 recombinants tested) and between  LAMBDA Mm1C136 and Bcg on the distal side (575 recombinants tested; FIG. 1A).
      <br/>
      Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and fluorescence in situ hybridization were then used to construct a long-range physical map of the Bcg region.
      <br/>
      The single copy probes used to construct the map are shown immediately below the map of FIG. 1B. The locus order and physical distances were found to be D1Mcg105-(160 kb)- LAMBDA Mm1-C165-(180 kb)-Vil-(800 kb)- LAMBDA Mm1C136, indicating a maximal physical interval for Bcg of 1.1 Mb (FIG. 1B).
      <br/>
      The size estimate of the minimal Bcg interval (D1Mcg105 to  LAMBDA Mm1C136) obtained by physical mapping is superior to that predicted by recombination analysis, possibly owing to uneven distribution of crossovers on this part of the chromosome (Malo et al., 1993, Genomics 17: 667-675).
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      To initiate the identification of candidate genes in the defined Bcg interval, the Princeton mouse YAC library (Burke et al., 1991, Genome 1: 65) was screened by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based protocol (Rossi et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 2456-2460), using as entry probes the two tightly linked DNA markers Vil and  LAMBDA Mm1C165.
      <br/>
      Primers Vil.1 (5'-TAGGAGGTTATGAGCCCGAAAGTG-3'; SEQ ID NO:7) and Vil.2 (5'-CTCAGGGAGAT-CCTCTACAGACTT-3'; SEQ ID NO:8) amplified a unique 120 bp Vil genomic DNA fragment, while primers 165.1 (5'-TGGTGCCCTGAGCATAGAGACTG-3'; SEQ ID NO:9) and 165.2 (5'-GTGGTATTTCGTGGTTGTCAGCCG-3'; SEQ ID NO:10) amplified a 110 bp  LAMBDA Mm1C165 genomic DNA fragment.
      <br/>
      Parameters for the PCR amplification were 1 min at 94 (degree)  C., 1 min at 65 (degree)  C., and 1 min at 72 (degree)  C. for 30 cycles, followed by a final extension period of 10 min at 72 (degree)  C., under experimental conditions suggested by the supplier of Taq DNA polymerase (BIOCAN, Montreal).
      <br/>
      The PCR products amplified from complex or simple pools of YAC clones were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel, and specific products were visualized either by direct ethidium bromide staining or by Southern blotting and hybridization to sequence-specific probes (i.e., the corresponding 32 P-labeled PCR amplification products obtained from cloned DNA using primers Vil.1-Vil.2 and 165.1-165.2).
      <br/>
      Single YAC clones corresponding to Vil (C32D10) and  LAMBDA Mm1C165 (D4F5) were further purified and isolated by filter hybridization and expanded in culture using yeast S. cerevisiae strain AB1380 grown in selective medium lacking uracil and tryptophan (Vidal et al., 1993, Cell 73: 469-485).
      <br/>
      The two positive YAC clones, D4F5 and C32D10 are 240 kb and 280 kb, respectively (FIG. 1C).
      <br/>
      The restriction enzyme map of the two clones was established by PFGE for the enzymes previously used to construct a physical map of the Bcg genomic region.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Yeast chromosomes were prepared in agarose blocks.
      <br/>
      Agarose block slices (25  MU l) were incubated with restriction enzymes NotI, MluI, NruI, BssHII, SacII, or AscI (New England Biolabs, Beverley, Mass.) under the conditions recommended by the supplier.
      <br/>
      The digested DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel (SeaKem/FMC (tm) , Rockland, Me.) containing 0.5 * TBE (1 * TBE is 0.1 M Tris, 0.1 M boric acid, 0.2 mM Na2 EDTA �pH 8.0�) using a contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF-DRII (tm) , Bio-Rad) configuration.
      <br/>
      Electrophoresis was performed at 200 V for 20 hr at 15 (degree)  C. with 15 s pulse times, allowing resolution of fragments in the range 20-400 kb.  LAMBDA  oligomers (Pharmacia) and AB1380 yeast genomic DNA were used as size standards.
      <br/>
      Southern blots of these gels were prepared, and a physical map of the YAC DNA insert was determined after sequential hybridization of the blots to 32 P-labeled individual single-copy probes from the region (Vil, D1Mcg101, D1Mcg102, D1Mcg103, D1Mcg104, and  LAMBDA Mm1C165), to plasmid fragments specific to each YAC cloning arm, and to total genomic mouse DNA.
      <br/>
      The left end probe was the larger and the right end probe the smaller of the two fragments produced by double-digestion of pBR322 with PvuII and BamHI.
      <br/>
      The restriction maps of the genomic DNA region and the corresponding YAC clones, together with the positions of the hybridization probes used for mapping, are shown in FIGS. 1B and 1C. The two YAC clones span a 400 kb segment and have a 170 kb region of overlap, which includes one of the entry probes,  LAMBDA Mm1C165 (FIG. 1C).
      <br/>
      A comparison of the composite restriction maps of the two overlapping YACs with that of genomic DNA shows concordance of both maps, suggesting that the two YAC clones carry non-chimeric inserts representative of the corresponding genomic DNA domain.
      <br/>
      Several additional rare-cutter sites were detected in both YACs that were absent in the genomic DNA (these sites are identified as closed symbols in FIG. 1C).
      <br/>
      The presence of newly accessible restriction enzyme sites in YAC clones has been previously documented (Wilkes et al., 1991, Genomics 9: 90-95) and has been attributed to the absence of DNA methylation of cytosines in yeast cells.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      To study this region further, a contig of cosmid and bacteriophage clones was constructed from the genomic domain isolated in the two YAC clones.
      <br/>
      Total genomic DNA from yeast strains carrying the D4F5 and C32D10 YACs was used to create a cosmid and a bacteriophage library, respectively.
      <br/>
      High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from yeast cultures following standard procedures.
      <br/>
      Total genomic DNA from the yeast clone carrying YAC D4F5 was partially digested with MboI, dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase (0.3 U/ MU g, Boehringer Mannheim), and size fractionated by centrifugation (200,000 * g, 3 hr, 25 (degree)  C.) on a continuous NaCl gradient (1.25-5 M).
      <br/>
      Fractions containing fragments larger than 30 kb were ligated into the BamHI cloning site of cosmid vector SuperCos (tm)  (Stratagene), packaged in vitro (Gigapack II Gold (tm) , Stratagene), and used to infect Escherichia coli strain DH5, which was subsequently plated on medium containing ampicillin (50  MU g/ml).
      <br/>
      To identify mouse-specific clones, colonies were gridded in duplicate onto nylon filters (Hybond (tm) , Amersham) followed by hybridization to a 32 P-labeled total genomic mouse DNA.
      <br/>
      Approximately 10% of the library (3 * 104 clones per  MU g of genomic DNA) was found to contain mouse-specific inserts by this approach.
      <br/>
      The DNA insert of YAC clone C32D10 was subcloned by a similar approach, except that it was introduced as a partial MboI digest into the BamHI site of the bacteriophage vector  LAMBDA EMBL3 (tm)  (Stratagene).
      <br/>
      Cloning efficiency was 1.2 * 105 pfu per  MU g of genomic insert DNA, and 3% of the clones were found to be mouse-specific.
      <br/>
      Cosmid and bacteriophage clones were expanded in culture and purified by standard protocols.
      <br/>
      A total of 40 cosmid and 30 phage clones hybridizing to total mouse DNA were isolated from these libraries; additional cosmid clones hybridizing to probes Vil,  LAMBDA Mm1C165, and D1Mcg105 were obtained directly from a total mouse genomic library.
      <br/>
      Cosmid and phage clones were ordered by fingerprinting with enzymes EcoRI and HindIII and by hybridization to either total mouse DNA or single-copy probes from the region.
      <br/>
      This analysis allowed the construction of a cosmid and phage contig that spans approximately 400 kb and includes the two markers (Vil and  LAMBDA Mm1C165) most tightly linked to the Bcg gene (FIG. 1C).
      <br/>
      The combined restriction maps of the YAC, cosmid, and phage clones from the region identified at least six CpG islands (numbered 1 to 6 in FIG. 1C), as defined by the clustering of two or more sites for enzymes with multiple CpG dinucleotides in their palindromic recognition sequences.
      <br/>
      Such CpG islands are often associated with the 5' end of transcribed genes and have been used as landmarks to identify coding sequences within large genomic DNA domains (Vidal et al., 1993, Cell 73: 469-485).
    </p>
    <p num="43">II. EXON AMPLIFICATION IN THE CLONED DOMAIN</p>
    <p num="44">
      The technique of exon amplification was used to initiate a systematic search for candidate transcription units within the cloned cosmid contig.
      <br/>
      This method is based on the functional screening for splicing competent exons within a cloned genomic DNA fragment.
      <br/>
      The screening for splicing competent exon could also be accomplished by exon trapping or gene tracking (Rommens et al., 1993, Hum.
      <br/>
      Mol. Genet. 2: 901-907).
      <br/>
      Exon amplification was performed exactly as described by (Buckler et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 4005-4009).
      <br/>
      Cosmid clones cosvil7, cosvil17, scos9.1, scos2.2, and scos21.1 were independently digested (4 hr, 37 (degree)  C.) with restriction enzymes BamHI and BgIII (Pharmacia) and subcloned as pools (one ligation per cosmid digest) into BamHI-digested and dephosphorylated pSPL1 (tm)  cloning vector, followed by transformation into E. coli strain DH5.
      <br/>
      The transformed cells were directly inoculated into 10 ml of LB broth containing ampicillin (50  MU g/ml) and grown overnight, and plasmid DNA was isolated by the alkaline lysis method.
      <br/>
      Cloning efficiency was determined by parallel plating of transformed cells onto agar plates and was always superior to 2 * 104 colonies per  MU g of pSPL1 (tm)  plasmid.
      <br/>
      COS-7 monkey cells were transiently transfected by electroporation using 5-10  MU g of each DNA pool, followed by incubation at 37 (degree)  C. for 72 hr, at which point cytoplasmic RNA was isolated as described by (Buckler et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 4005-4009).
      <br/>
      For first-strand cDNA synthesis, 1-5  MU g of cytoplasmic RNA was incubated with 20 pmol of pSPL1-specific oligonucleotide primer SA4 (5'-CCCGTCGACCACCTGAGGAGTGAATTGGTCG-3': SEQ ID NO:11) and incubated with 200 U of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in a final reaction volume of 25  MU l, under conditions suggested by the supplier of the enzyme (GIBCO-BRL).
      <br/>
      Trapped genomic exons were PCR amplified from the hybrid human immunodefiency virus tat cDNAs generated by the splice vector using tat-specific oligonucleotide primers SA4 and SD2 (5'-GTGAACTGCACTGTGACAAGCTGC-3'; SEQ ID NO:12).
      <br/>
      PCR-amplified exons were purified by gel electrophoresis and subjected to a second round of amplification using additional primers SA1 (5'-CCCGTCGACGTCGGGTCCCCTCGGGATTGG-3'; SEQ ID NO:13) and SD1 (5'-CCCGGATCCGCGACGAAGACCTCCTCAAGGC-3'; SEQ ID NO:14) immediately flanking the pSPL1 cloning site, using the PCR parameters and conditions described by (Buckler et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 4005-4009).
      <br/>
      Finally, amplified exons were purified by electrophoresis on low melting agarose gels and cloned directly into a dT-tailed (Marchuk et al., 1991, Nucl.
      <br/>
      Acids Res. 19: 1154) EcoRV-digested pBluescript II (tm)  KS (+) plasmid vector (Stratagene).
      <br/>
      In this manner, a total of 22 putative exons ranging from 69 to 450 bp were recovered from these cosmids, and a summary of their characteristics is presented in Table 1.

      Several criteria were used to distinguish bona fide exons from false positives and to group these true exons into transcription units.
      <br/>
      These included nucleotide sequencing and comparison to DNA sequence data bases (GenBank (tm)  and EMBL (tm) ) and the capacity of discrete exons to recognize the following in hybridization experiments: the corresponding cosmid clone used to construct the pSPL1 library, genomic DNA sequences from distantly related species ("Zoo blots"), and specific mRNA transcripts or cDNA clones.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Initially, all exons were sequenced, and a homology search in the GenBank (tm)  and EMBL (tm)  data bases failed to detect homologous sequences, except for exon E32 (cosvil7), which was found to be part of the mouse Vil gene (89% identity to human VIL).
      <br/>
      Exons larger than 99 bp were then assessed for cross-species homology, using "Zoo blots" of genomic DNA from mouse, rat, human, pig, chicken, and fish (respectively, lanes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in FIG. 2). "Zoo blots" were prepared using BamHI-digested DNA (5-10 U per  MU g of DNA) from rat (liver), human (Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts), pig (liver), chicken (blood) and fish (liver), and fragmentation products were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in TAE buffer, followed by capillary transfer to nylon membranes (Hybond) in 20 * SSC (1 * SSC is 0.15M NaCl, 0.015M sodium citrate).
      <br/>
      The low stringency hybridization conditions of the "zoo blot" included prehybridizations for 16 hr at 42 (degree)  C. in a mixture of 35% formamide, 5 * SSC, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.02M Tris (ph 7.5), 1 * Denhardt's solution (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Ficoll (tm) , 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone), and denatured salmon sperm DNA (200  MU g/ml).
      <br/>
      Hybridizations were performed in the same solution containing the 32 P-radiolabeled probe (1 * 106 cpm/ml).
      <br/>
      The hybridized membranes were washed to a final stringency of 0.5 * SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 (degree)  C. for 30 min.
      <br/>
      As summarized in FIG. 2 and Table 1, eight (8) of sixteen (16) exons tested by the "Zoo blot" approach showed cross-species conservation.

      Murine lymphoid tumor cell lines L1210 and P388, and monkey COS-7 cells were originally obtained from Dr. D. Housman (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass.).

      J774A macrophages (ATCC accession number TIB67), RAG renal adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC accession number CCL142), adrenal cortex tumor cell line Y1 (ATCC accession number CCL79), were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.

      Rat hepatoma cell lines H35 and HCT were a gift of Dr. R. Levenson (Yale University, New Haven, Conn.).
      <br/>
      Adherent cells were grown in alpha-minimal essential medium ( ALPHA -MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics (50 U/ml penicillin and 50  MU g/ml steptomycin), while cells in suspension were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 20  MU M  BETA -mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics.
      <br/>
      Splenic macrophages were isolated from CBA/J (Bcgr) and C57BL/6J (Bcgs) mice.
      <br/>
      To isolate enriched populations of splenic macrophages, groups of five mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and their spleens were aseptically removed.
      <br/>
      The spleens were gently teased with a scalpel and tweezers, and spleen cells were dispersed in 10 ml of cold complete RPMI 1640 (supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum) using a syringe fitted with a 22 g needle.
      <br/>
      Viable cells (2.5 * 107) were plated in 15 ml of medium (150 mm dish) and allowed to adhere to the plastic surface by incubation at 37 (degree)  C. for 4 hr in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Nonadherent cells were removed by succes-sive washes with warm phosphate-buffered saline, and adherent cells were detached using a rubber policeman after a 10 min incubation in cold phosphate-buffered saline.
      <br/>
      Between 2 * 106 and 8 * 106 viable adherent cells per mouse spleen could be purified by this method.
      <br/>
      The RNA was extracted using 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride and purified by sequential ethanol precipitations and phenolchloroform extractions.
      <br/>
      Total RNA (10  MU g) was fractionated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing 0.66 M formaldehyde and MOPS buffer (1 * MOPS is 40 mM morpholinopropanesulfonic acid, 10 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM EDTA �pH 7.2�) and blotted onto nylon membranes (GeneScreen Plus (tm) , New England Nuclear) in 10 * SSC.
      <br/>
      RNA blots were prehybridized for 2 hr at 65 (degree)  C. in 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and denatured salmon sperm DNA (100  MU g/ml).
      <br/>
      Hybridization was performed for 20 hr at 65 (degree)  C. in the same solution containing the 32 P-radiolabeled probe (0.5 * 108 to 1 * 108 cmp/ml), and hybridized membranes were then washed at a final stringency of 0.1 * SSC, 1% SDS at 65 (degree)  C. Autoradiography of all hybridized filters was performed with Kodak XAR (tm)  film at -80 (degree)  C. with an intensifying screen.
      <br/>
      All hybridization probes were labeled to high specific activity (109 cpm per  MU g of DNA), using � ALPHA -32 P�dATP (DuPont, NEN Research Products, Boston, Mass.) by the random priming method.
      <br/>
      In this manner, 6 exons were grouped into three independent candidate transcription units (Table 1 and FIGS. 3A-J): E73, E84, and E93 detected a 1.5 kb transcript (candidate 1), E59 and E62 detected a 3.6 kb mRNA (candidate 2), and E52 detected a 2.5 kb transcript (candidate 5).
      <br/>
      However, many exons did not detect discrete mRNA transcripts by Northern blot analysis, possibly owing to low abundance or cell type-specific expression.
      <br/>
      Screening of cDNA libraries constructed in bacteriophage vectors  LAMBDA gt10 and  LAMBDA  LAMBDA gt11 and obtained by priming mRNA (pre-B cell line 70/Z; (Gros et al., 1986, Nature 323: 728-731) with oligo(dT) or random hexamers, respectively, and inserting the cDNA inserts in the unique EcoRI site of  LAMBDA gt10 or  LAMBDA gt11, with all candidate exons, independently or as pools was also performed.
      <br/>
      In addition, probes E8.57 and E1.3 were used to screen a cDNA library constructed in vector  LAMBDA gt11 and obtained by priming rat brain mRNA with random hexamers (R.
      <br/>
      Dunn, McGill University, Montreal).
      <br/>
      Positive phage clones were plaque purified by routine methods, and their insert was subcloned into the unique EcoRI site of plasmid vector pBluescript II KS(+) or bacteriophage M13mp18, two examples of prokaryotic vectors.
      <br/>
      Three additional candidate transcription units were identified in these screens: exon probes E8.57 and E86 each identified, in the pre-B cell mouse library, independent sets of overlapping clones corresponding to candidates 4 and 6, respectively, while exon probe E1.3 identified, in the rat brain library, another group of cDNAs corresponding to candidate 3 (Table 1).
      <br/>
      Therefore, 11 of the 22 putative exons defined a minimum of seven independent transcription units within the Bcg gene region, which included the Vil gene and candidates 1 to 6 (FIG. 1D).
    </p>
    <p num="50">III. CHARACTERIZATION OF CANDIDATE TRANSCRIPTION UNITS NEAR Bcg</p>
    <p num="51">
      Complementary DNA clones corresponding to the six candidate genes were isolated and used to determine their pattern of tissue-specific expression.
      <br/>
      Searches were conducted for genes expressed in the RE organs, such as the spleen and liver, and in particular for genes expressed in the mature tissue macrophages populating these organs, since these cells have been shown to be responsible for the phenotypic expression of Bcg.
      <br/>
      Genes whose expression profile included one of these tissues were further characterized by nucleotide sequencing of corresponding cDNAs.
      <br/>
      Nucleotide sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method, using modified T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia) and denatured double-stranded DNA templates or single-stranded M13mp18 recombinant phage template.
      <br/>
      Oligonucleotide primers were derived from the known sequence of the cDNA inserts or were plasmid based and flanked the cloning site used.
      <br/>
      In the case of Nramp and candidates 1 and 2, cDNA clones were obtained and characterized by nucleotide sequencing using at least two independent clones.
    </p>
    <p num="52">The expression profile of each candidate was established by Northern blot analysis, using total cellular RNA from normal mouse tissues and a number of cultured cell lines of distinct tissue origin (FIGS. 3A-J) and the exposure times were either 12 hr (E84 and E62) or 72 hr (E52, E1.3, E8.57, and E86) and reflect the relative abundance of each transcript.</p>

      Vil, originally used as an entry probe to screen the YAC genomic library, was identified by nucleotide sequencing of exon E32 (cosvil7).
      <br/>
      In Northern blots, probe E32 detected a 3.8 kb mRNA that was expressed exclusively in intestine and kidney and was absent from organs and cell types of the RE system.
      <br/>
      Villin is a cytoskeleton protein that participates in the Ca2+ -dependent assembly of actin filaments in epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tract.

    <p num="54">
      Candidate 1 was identified by exon probe E84 (cos165.1; FIGS. 1C and 1D).
      <br/>
      E84 showed very strong cross-species conservation on the "Zoo blot" (FIG. 2A) and detected 1.4 and 1.5 kb mRNA species expressed abundantly in a large number of tissues and cell types, including those of the RE system (FIGS. 3A and 3B).
      <br/>
      The highest levels of expression of this gene were detected in RNA from testis, spleen, embryo, the macrophage cell line J77A4, macrophage and lymphocyte populations of the spleen (FIG. 3A), and other cell lines of unrelated tissue origin (FIG. 3B).
      <br/>
      A set of overlapping cDNA clones were then isolated (clone frequency 1/500 in the pre-B cell library) and mapped with respect to the cloned domain.
      <br/>
      Hybridization to cosmid clones from the region showed that this gene is transcribed in the centromere to telomere direction, with its 5' end associated with CpG island 2 (FIGS. 1C and 1d).
      <br/>
      Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the two mRNAs detected by Northern blot analysis have distinct 5' ends but share an open reading frame that could encode a protein of 244 amino acids; this protein appears highly hydrophilic and did not have homology with sequences deposited in the GenBank (tm) , EMBL (tm) , and SwissProt (tm)  data bases.
      <br/>
      The EMBL (tm) , GenBank (tm) , and SwissProt (tm)  data bases were searched using the GCG (tm)  software package (Devereux, 1991, Version 7.0, Madison, Wis.: Genetics Computer Group, Inc.) on a DEC VAX (tm)  computer (Universite de Montreal, Montreal).

    <p num="55">
      Candidate 2 was identified by exon probe E62 (cosvil17; FIGS. 1C and 1D).
      <br/>
      E62 also showed strong cross-species conservation on the "Zoo blot" (FIG. 2B) and detected two mRNA transcripts of 3.3 and 3.6 kb that were abundantly and ubiquitously expressed in most tissues and cell lines analyzed (FIGS. 3C and 3D).
      <br/>
      The highest levels of expression were detected in embryo, kidney, intestine, liver, and spleen, while in cultured cell lines only the P388 leukemia did not express this gene.
      <br/>
      Full-length cDNA clones for these transcripts were then isolated (frequency 1/1000 in the pre-B cell library), and hybridization experiments indicated that this gene is transcribed in the centromere to telomere direction, with the 5' end associated with CpG island 6 (FIGS. 1C and 1D).
      <br/>
      Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the two mRNA transcripts are generated from the same gene by the use of alternative polyadenylation signals, and both could encode a polypeptide of a minimum of 336 amino acids; like the candidate 1 gene product, this protein appears to be highly hydrophilic and does not have homology to sequences deposited in available data bases.
      <br/>
      Taken together, the ubiquitous nature and high levels of expression of candidates 1 and 2 in the panel of tissues and cell lines analyzed and their high degree of evolutionary conservation suggest that both genes may perform "housekeeping" functions.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Candidates 3, 4 and 6 were identified with exon probes E1.3, E8.57 and E86, respectively, which were amplified from three nonoverlapping cosmids (Table 1).
      <br/>
      Although evolutionary conservation was evident for some of these exons (E1.3 and E8.57; (FIGS. 2C AND 2D), all attempts to identify corresponding mRNAs by Northern blotting were unsuccessful (FIGS. 3G and 3H).
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, cDNA clones corresponding to each of these exons were successfully isolated.
      <br/>
      A 1.2 kb cDNA for candidate 3 was isolated from a rat brain cDNA library, using exon probe E1.3. Candidate 3 was found to map within cosmid scos9.1 at the proximal end of the cloned domain, distal to the locus D1Mcg105 and associated with CpG island 1 (FIGS. 1C and 1D).
      <br/>
      Overlapping cDNA clones of 2.5 kb and 3 kb were identified for candidate 4 by exon probe E8.57 in the pre-B cell cDNA library.
      <br/>
      Candidate 4 was found to overlap cosmid scos2.2, mapped 50 kb distal to candidate 3, and was not associated with a CpG island (FIGS. 1C and 1D).
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, we could not position candidates 3 and 4 with respect to the single crossover detected by linkage analysis between Bcg and D1Mcg105 and delineating the proximal boundary of the Bcg interval (Vidal et al., 1993, Cell 73: 469-485).
      <br/>
      Finally, a 1.2 kb cDNA clone for candidate 6 was isolated from the pre-B cell library.
      <br/>
      This gene was found to be included in cosmid cos165.1 and mapped near candidate 1, associated with CpG island 3 (FIGS 1C and 1D).
      <br/>
      However, since RNA expression could not be detected for these genes in any of the normal tissues or cultures cells analyzed, they were not characterized further.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Candidate 5 was identified by exon probe E52 (cosvil17).
      <br/>
      This probe showed a high degree of evolutionary conservation on the "Zoo blot" (FIG. 2E) and was used to isolate corresponding cDNA clones from the pre-B cell library.
      <br/>
      Twenty-two positive clones were identified (frequency 1/100,000), the longest clone being 2.4 kb. Candidate 5 was found to be entirely contained within cosvil17, mapping 50 kb proximal to Vil, and transcribed in the centromere to telomere direction (FIGS. 1C and 1D).
      <br/>
      Northern blotting analyses in normal tissues indicated that candidate 5 codes for a 2.5 kb mRNA whose expression could only be detected in the spleen (FIG. 3E); however, prolonged exposure of the autoradiogram in FIG. 3E also indicated low level expression of this gene in another RE organ, the liver.
      <br/>
      Moreover, fractionation of spleen cells into macrophage-enriched (adherent) and lymphocyte-enriched (nonadherent) subpopulations showed that candidate 5 expression was restricted to and greatly enhanced in the macrophage compartment (FIG. 3E).
      <br/>
      Likewise, analysis of candidate 5 expression in cell lines from distinct tissue origins showed that expression of this gene was restricted to the murine macrophage cell line J774A (FIG. 3F).
      <br/>
      In conclusion, unlike the other candidate genes identified within the cloned domain, candidate 5 expression is restricted to RE organs and is enriched in macrophage populations derived from these tissues and in a macrophage cell line.
      <br/>
      Expression of this gene in tissues and cell types known to express Bcg phenotypically, together with its chromosomal location, makes it a strong candidate for the Bcg gene.
      <br/>
      This gene has been given the appellation natural resistance-associated macrophage protein gene, or Nramp.

      The position of the glycine (G) to aspartic acid (D) substitution at position 105 within predicted TM 2, which is associated with susceptibility (Bcgs), is shown.
      <br/>
      The presence of several stop codons in all reading frames within the first 468 nt of the cDNA indicates that this region is untranslated.
      <br/>
      The first possible initiator ATG codon is followed by a segment of 1452 nucleotide, forming a single open reading frame that can encode a polypeptide of 484 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 53,000 (FIG. 4 and SEQ ID NO:2).
      <br/>
      The in-frame termination codon (TGA) immediately downstream of Gly-484 is followed by 557 nucleotides of 3' untranslated region, ending with eleven (11) consecutive adenosine residues.
      <br/>
      The sequence immediately upstream of the poly(dA) tail contains an intact AATAAA polyadenylation signal.
      <br/>
      The size of the longest Nramp cDNA (2.48 kb) is compatible with the estimated size (2.5 kb) of the Nramp transcript expressed in splenic macrophages and macrophage cell lines (FIG. 3E).

      A search of the GenBank (tm)  and SwissProt (tm)  date bases revealed that the Nramp gene encodes a polypeptide with no apparent sequence similarity to any previously identified protein.

      In particular, a hydropathy analysis identifies a series of strongly hydrophobic domains that are similar to the membrane-spanning regions of polytopic membrane proteins (Gros et al., 1986, Nature 323: 728-731).

      <br/>
      The Nramp gene product also contains two potential N-linked glycosylation site (N-X-S/T) at positions 257 and 271, clustered within a highly hydrophilic region between predicted TM 5 and TM 6 (FIG. 4), and two potential sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C (S/T-X-R/K; Woodget et al., 1986, Eur. J. Biochem. 161: 177-184), one within a hydrophilic region flanked by predicted TM 4 and TM 5 (position 205) and another near the carboxyl terminus (position 466).

    <p num="62">
      In addition, the Nramp protein contains a precisely conserved sequence motif known as the "binding-protein-dependent transport system inner membrane component signature", first identified in a group of bacterial transport proteins (Kerppola and Ames 1992, J. Biol. Chem. 267: 2329-2336).
      <br/>
      This twenty (20) amino acid transport motif spans positions 306 to 325 of Nramp and is located between predicted TM 6 and TM 7 (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Bacterial binding-protein-dependent transport systems, or periplasmic permeases, are multisubunit transporters composed of a periplasmic substrate-binding protein, one- or two homologous inner membrane proteins, and one or two peripheral ATP-binding energy coupling subunits.
      <br/>
      The integral membrane subunits are highly hydrophobic and are believed to participate in substrate translocation across the membrane.
      <br/>
      Although these proteins show little primary sequence homology, they all share a similar predicted membrane organization, including a minimum of 5 TM domains and the conserved transport motif located amino-terminal to the last 2 TM domains (95 to 130 residues from their carboxyl terminus) on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Kerppola and Ames 1992, J. Biol. Chem. 267: 2329-2336).
      <br/>
      Alignment of the consensus transport sequence detected in bacterial and eukaryotic transporters and shared by Nramp is shown in FIG. 5.

      The sequence alignment of this motif is presented for the histidine (HisQ), maltose (MalF), phosphate (PstA, PstC), and molybdenum (ChlJ) bacterial transporters, together with the corresponding motifs detected in the eukaryotic nitrate transporter CrnA and in Nramp.
      <br/>
      In the alignment, the conserved residues are stippled and the degenerate consensus sequence is shown at the top.
      <br/>
      The evolutionary conservation of this motif in otherwise nonhomologous membrane components of bacterial transporters acting on different substrates probably reflects a common mechanistic aspect of transport.

      Indeed, it has been proposed that this protein fold may participate in physical interaction and/or functional coupling between the membrane subunits and the peripheral ATP-binding subunits (Kerppola and Ames, 1992, J. Biol. Chem 267: 2329-2336).
      <br/>
      Bacterial periplasmic permeases are members of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of membrane transporters, which also includes homologs in lower and higher eukaryotes (Buschman et al., 1992, Int.
      <br/>
      Rev. Cytol. 137C: 169-197).
      <br/>
      These have been shown to participate in the outward translocation of specific substrates across cellular membranes.
      <br/>
      The conserved transport motif has not been retained by the eukaryotic ATP-binding cassette transporters, where the ATP-binding subunits and membrane anchors are integrated in the same polypeptide (Buschman et al., 1992, Int.
      <br/>
      Rev. Cytol. 137C: 169-197).
      <br/>
      However, a data base search revealed that a similar motif is present in certain eukaryotic transport proteins of the non-ATP-binding cassette type, including the (Na+,K+) ATPase of Drosophila melanogaster and the uracil permease of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Vidal et al., 1993, Cell 73: 469-485).
      <br/>
      In this group, the permease for nitrate uptake encoded by the crnA gene of the eukaryote Aspergillus nidulans is of particular interest (Vidal et al., 1993, Cell 73: 469-485).
      <br/>
      Similarly to Nramp, the CrnA protein is composed of 483 amino acids, with 10 putative TM domains (Vidal et al., 1993, Cell 73: 469-485) and the conserved transport motif located between predicted TM 6 and TM 7 (FIGS. 4 and 5).
      <br/>
      Thus, while the Nramp protein shows little primary sequence homology to other membrane proteins, it does have structural similarities with a variety of bacterial and eukaryotic transport proteins.
      <br/>
      In particular, Nramp has similarity with the nitrate transporter CrnA, not only with respect to size and the number and distribution of hydrophobic domains, but also with respect to the presence and position of the conserved transport motif.

    <p num="63">V. A MUTATION IN PREDICTED TM 2 OF MOUSE Nramp IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE Bcgs PHENOTYPE</p>
    <p num="64">
      Kinetic analysis of mRNA levels in control and infected macrophages revealed that the level of Nramp gene expression was similar in Bcgr and Bcgs mice and did not fluctuate significantly during the course of infection in vivo.
      <br/>
      Therefore, to assess the candidacy of this gene further, we analyzed mRNA transcripts from Bcgr and Bcgs strains for the presence of sequence alterations in the coding portion of the Nramp gene.
      <br/>
      Two pairs of oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify Nramp-specific cDNAs by PCR from 2 Bcgs (BALB/cJ and C57BL/6J) and 3 Bcgr strains (C57L/J, C3H/HeJ, DBA/2J).
      <br/>
      The amplified products were then subcloned and fully sequenced.
      <br/>
      A single nucleotide difference was found to segregate between Bcgr and Bcgs mice: the 3 resistant strains presented a guanine at nucleotide 783 (amino acid 105), while the 2 susceptible strains presented an adenine at the same position (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      This nucleotide variation results in a single amino acid change, a glycine to aspartic acid substitution at position 105 within the second predicted TM domain.
      <br/>
      In addition, two silent mutations were detected in the 5' portion of the Nramp transcript from C3H/HeJ mice, one at nucleotide 563 (Ala-32, GCG --&gt; GCC) and another at nucleotide 1169 (Phe-234, TTC --&gt; TTT); the other resistant and susceptible strains tested were identical at these two positions (Ala-32, GCG; Phe-234, TTC) (FIG. 6).
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      To confirm the segregation of the observed sequence variation between resistant and susceptible mouse strains the 5' half of the Nramp transcript has now been analyzed in a total of 20 Bcgr strains and 7 Bcgs strains.
      <br/>
      A compilation of the results is presented in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Among all the polymorphisms detected within Nramp in the 27 strains tested, four out of five were silent mutations.
      <br/>
      The first was a G --&gt; C transversion at nucleotide 565 (GCG --&gt; GCC, Ala32, TM1) detected in A/J, C3H/HeJ, CBA/J.
      <br/>
      NZB/B1NJ, NOD/Lt and Mus spretus, the second was a C --&gt; A transversion at nucleotide 784 (GGC --&gt; GGA, Gly105, TM2) specific to the SWR/J strain, the third was a C --&gt; T transition at nucleotide 1171 (TTC --&gt; TTT, Phe234, TM5) in A/J, C3H/HeJ, NZB/B1NJ and CBA/J strains, and the fourth was a G --&gt; A transition at nucleotide 1444 (AAG --&gt; AAA, Lys325, consensus transport sequence motif) specific to the NOD/Lt strain.
      <br/>
      The G --&gt; A transition at nucleotide 783 resulting in a Gly to Asp substitution at position 105 of Nramp within predicted TM2 was the only non-silent mutation identified in Nramp and was also the only one which segregated according to the Bcg type of all strains tested: the 20 BCG-R strains presented a guanine at nucleotide 783 (Gly105), while the 7 BCG-S strains presented an adenine (Asp105) at that position.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the analysis of 14 inbred strains of various ancestral origins confirmed and extended to 27 inbred strains the absolute association of the Gly vs Asp substitution at position 105 with the BCG-R and BCG-S phenotypes, respectively.
      <br/>
      Although this sequence analysis identified additional novel sequence polymorphisms within Nramp, they neither affected the predicted sequence of the protein nor were associated with the Bcg phenotype.
      <br/>
      A helical wheel representation of TM 2 reveals that this mutated residue maps on a strongly hydrophobic face of the proposed helix.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a Gly to Asp substitution at this position would be expected to profoundly alter the physical properties of this proposed transmembrane domain.
      <br/>
      This could in turn affect the overall membrane-associated structure and/or membrane insertion of the protein in the susceptible mouse strains.
      <br/>
      These findings, together with the chromosomal location, the homology to the nitrate transporter CrnA, the role of simple oxidized nitrogen metabolites in the cytocidal response of macrophages to ingested intracellular parasites, and the macrophage-specific expression of Nramp, identify this gene as a strong candidate for Bcg.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The confirmation that Nramp indeed is Bcg has now been demonstrated in vivo in mouse by "knock out".
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it has been shown that the mutation in the transmembrane 2 (TM2) region of Nramp is sufficient to confer the sensitivity phenotype to a mouse having the proper genetic make-up for the experiment.

    <p num="67">VI. ISOLATION OF TWO (2) HUMAN Nramp cDNAS AND AN ADDITIONAL MOUSE Nramp cDNA</p>
    <p num="68">The strategy to isolate the human counterpart of mouse Nramp was based on two major findings:</p>
    <p num="69">
      1) the "Zoo blot" results showed that exon E62 (candidate 5; FIG. 2E) showed a high degree of evolutionary conservation, and identified a relatively strong human DNA band (FIG. 2E, lane 2); and
      <br/>
      2) Northern blotting analyses indicated that E52 (candidate 5, Nramp) was expressed in liver, hence the screening of a liver cDNA library to isolate the human Nramp cDNA.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      We thus reasoned that screening of a human liver cDNA library under low stringency conditions, similar to those used for the "Zoo blot", would yield the sought after human Nramp counterpart.
      <br/>
      A 1.2 kb Eco RI Sac II fragment from the mouse Nramp cDNA was used in a low stringency screen of a human liver cDNA library (Stratagene).
      <br/>
      One (1) putative human Nramp cDNA clone was isolated, sequenced and showed an approximately 75% homology to mouse Nramp.
      <br/>
      Using the same 1.2 kb Eco RI Sac II probe on a cosmid library under high stringency, a human genomic clone was isolated and sequenced.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, however, comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the human cDNA clone and the human genomic clone indicated that they were different, suggesting that more than one gene for Nramp was present in humans.
      <br/>
      Since the genomic human Nramp clone was more closely related to the mouse Nramp cDNA clone than it was to the human cDNA clone, the former was termed human Nramp-1 (SEQ ID NO:3) and the latter human Nramp-2 (SEQ ID NO:5).
      <br/>
      Using the mouse Nramp cDNA and human Nramp-2 cDNA, gene specific probes were identified.
      <br/>
      A mouse Nramp specific probe was used at high stringency to screen a human spleen cDNA library and permitted the isolation of several human Nramp-1 cDNA clones.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a human Nramp-2 specific probe was used to re-screen the 70/Z mouse pre-B cDNA library and permitted the isolation of several cDNA clones corresponding to mouse Nramp-2 cDNA.
      <br/>
      One such cDNA clone, was sequenced and shown to comprise 2.967 kb (SEQ. ID NO:26).

      <br/>
      A sequence mistake was identified in HNramp-1, as a C was shown to be missing between the two (2) A at positions 221 and 222, respectively (SEQ. ID NO:3).
      <br/>
      Insertion of the missing C permits a N-terminal extension of the open reading frame of HNramp-1 to yield a predicted protein of 550 amino acids (SEQ. ID NO:29 and SEQ ID NO:30) that initiates at an AUG found at position 80 of SEQ.

    <p num="73">
      Comparison of the human and mouse predicted NRAMP protein sequences revealed a remarkable degree of conservation between the two polypeptides, with 88% identical residues and 93% overall sequence similarity.
      <br/>
      Substitutions were not randomly distributed along the length of the protein but were clustered within discrete predicted structural domains (FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      The extreme amino (residues 1-50, 66% identity) and carboxy terminal ends (residues 517-550, 74% identity) of the two proteins were the least conserved segments, and gaps of 3 residues (positions 20-22 of mouse sequence) and 1 residue (position 546 of human sequence) had to be introduced to optimize alignments in these segments.
      <br/>
      In addition, the predicted second (TM 3-4 segment, positions 218-240; 63% identity) and third extracytoplasmic loops (TM5-6 segment, positions 310-349; 67% identity) showed significant sequence divergence.
      <br/>
      The fifth putative intracytoplasmic loop located between TM 8-9 (positions 450-468, 61% identity) and the last predicted TM10 domain (positions 496-517, 67% identity) also contained a cluster of substitutions that were mainly conservative.
      <br/>
      The rest of the amino terminal third up to and including TM3 (residues 50 to 217) and the segment overlapping TM6 to TM8 (residues 340 to 462) were the most conserved portions (97% identical, 99% similar) (FIGS. 2E, 2F).
      <br/>
      The mouse Nramp protein was predicted to encode two consensus signals (S/T-X-R/K) for phosphorylation by protein kinase C, one in the predicted intracytoplasmic loop between TM 4 and 5, and another one in the extreme C-terminal domain (Vidal et al., 1993, Cell 73:469-485).
      <br/>
      These two predicted sites were not conserved in the human protein, instead a new one was found within the N-terminal region (position 54, FIG. 1A).
      <br/>
      By contrast, both proteins have retained the two predicted N-linked glycosylation sites within the third predicted extracellular loop (TM 5-6 interval).
      <br/>
      As expected, the "binding protein dependent transport system inner membrane component signature" was highly conserved in human NRAMP, including a conservative arginine to lysine substitution at the last position (position 392) of the motif.
      <br/>
      The highly hydrophobic predicted membrane associated domains of the proteins were strikingly conserved in the two species.
      <br/>
      Predicted TM 1-8 were identical in sequence (except for a single isoleucine to valine conservative substitution in TM 6), including four charged amino acids in TM 1, 2, 3 and 7.
      <br/>
      This suggests that these TM domains and residues play key structural and functional roles in this protein, and also suggests that non-conservative substitutions are not tolerated in these regions to retain function.
      <br/>
      This extremely high degree of conservation in the transmembrane domains is somewhat surprising since conservative substitution of hydrophobic amino acids are usually tolerated in TM domains without alteration or loss of function between homologs of the same proteins.
      <br/>
      This is of particular interest since the only amino acid sequence variation detected in Nramp between inbred mouse strains of opposite genotypes at Bcg is a single non-conservative glycine to aspartic acid substitution within predicted TM2 identified in innately susceptible (Bcgs) strains.
      <br/>
      The observation that this TM domain in general, and glycine in particular are precisely conserved in human and mouse, strongly argues that this domain is important for function, and that non-conservative substitution in this region are likely to affect the function of this putative transporter.

    <p num="74">
      The Nramp-2 mRNA transcripts were found to be ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested.
      <br/>
      The level of Nramp-2 expression was fairly low and its detection by Northern blotting required the use poly A+RNA.
      <br/>
      This is in sharp contrast to the Nramp-1 gene which was found to be expressed in a tissue specific fashion in reticuloendothelial organs, in general, and mature tissue macrophages, in particular.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The high degree of sequence similarity between Nramp-1 and Nramp-2 strongly suggests an underlying functional homology.

      Both types of proteins could act on the same type of substrates but in different tissues.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Now isolated, the Nramp DNAs can be used in a variety of ways.
      <br/>
      For example, Nramp can be inserted in an expression vector.
      <br/>
      Such vectors contain all necessary regulatory signals to promote the expression of a DNA segment of interest.
      <br/>
      Expression vectors are typically either prokaryote specific, or eukaryote specific.
      <br/>
      However, vectors have been developed which can promote the expression of a DNA sequence of interest in either a prokaryotic or eukaryotic system.
      <br/>
      Such vectors are known as shuttle vectors.

      The methods of subcloning cDNA inserts into vectors is well-known in the art (Sambrook et al. 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press).

      Bluescript II KS(+) or M13mp18, mentioned above are two examples of prokaryotic vectors.

      Once having inserted the Nramp sequences or parts thereof, they can be transformed into a bacterial host according to well-known methods Sambrook et al. 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press).

      <br/>
      The eukaryotic expression vectors are useful for expressing the DNA sequence of interest, or part thereof and can permit sophisticated analysis of the functional regions of the protein encoded therefrom.
      <br/>
      For example, Nramp having previously been mutagenised in vitro, could be introduced in macrophage cells, by well-known methods, and these macrophages could be challenged with infectious agents in order to assess the resistance/sensitivity phenotype.

      It should be understood that other types of vectors for specific functions could also be used, such as vectors designed for gene replacement.

      To substantiate the importance of the predicted TM2 segment in Nramp-1 in which residue 105 is located, the portion of the Nramp transcript encoding the predicted TM2 from Nramp DNA or cDNA clones of rat (strains ACI, BB, Buffalo and BN), human (nine individuals) and chicken (strain C, W, 15I, N, 61 and 72) origins were cloned and sequenced.
      <br/>
      To isolate these clones, different methods were used.
      <br/>
      The rat clone for example was isolated using a mouse Nramp-1 probe selected from a well conserved region.
      <br/>
      The probe was used to screen a rat cDNA library under low stringency hybridization conditions as exemplified by the "Zoo blot" hybridization conditions mentioned above.
      <br/>
      The rabbit Nramp sequence was isolated using selected oligos and using standard RT-PCR conditions at low stringency ("PCR Protocols-A Guide to methods and applications", 1990, M. A. Innis et al., Eds., Acad. Press, Ca) to facilitate oligonucleotide annealing.
      <br/>
      Other well-known methods to isolate cDNAs 30 or fragment thereof could be used.
      <br/>
      To obtain a full length clone, the fragment of Nramp isolated for example by low stringency hybridization, could be used at high stringency in an intra-species hybridization experiment.

      As shown in FIG. 8, the sequence of TMT2 is well conserved in the four species analyzed.
      <br/>
      In fact, only two amino acid variations are detected in this domain between the chicken protein and that from the other species, a Val to Thr substitution at position 111 and a Phe to Leu substitution at position 114.
      <br/>
      These results suggest that TM2 plays an important functional role and that substitutions in codon 105 have not been tolerated during evolution in order to preserve function.
      <br/>
      Based on the conservation of the TM2 domains between distantly related animal species, and the absolute correlation between the Bcgr phenotype and the presence of Gly at position 105 in mouse Nramp1, the TM2 domain appears as a good target to identify genetic differences between animals which are resistant/susceptible to antigenically unrelated intracellular parasites, and more specifically, to identify in the human population genetic differences correlating with the susceptibility to tuberculosis and other intracellular macrophage infections such as leprosy, typhoid fever and Kala Azar.

    <p num="93">Identification of Polymorphism and Sequence Variants in the Human Natural Resistant-associated Macrophage Protein (NRAMP) Gene</p>
    <p num="94">
      Several methods were used to search for mutation in the Nramp-1 gene in genomic DNA of a panel of individuals which included nine members of an extended aboriginal Canadian families and twenty-four individuals from 11 Hong-Kong families.
      <br/>
      DNA samples were obtained from EBV-transformed cell lines of nine unrelated native Canadians who are members of an extended multiplex tuberculosis family, twenty-four unrelated individuals from eleven Chinese tuberculosis families, and from white blood cells of sixty unrelated Caucasian and twenty unrelated Oriental individuals.
      <br/>
      High molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from EBV-transformed cells and white blood cells according to standard protocols Sambrook et al. (1989, Molecular Cloning: Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Coldspring Harbor Laboratory Press), quantified by standard UV spectroscopy, and stored at 4 (degree)  C. in te(pH8).
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Polymorphisms have been identified within and around the human Nramp-1 gene.
      <br/>
      For example, southern blot analysis of an ApI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was detected (allelel=5 kb, allele2=4 kb+1 kb) by using a Nramp cDNA probe.
      <br/>
      Sequencial hybridization using Nramp exon probes to DNA from individuals heterozygous for the RFLP and direct sequencing identified the polymorphism.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      For southern analysis, 5  MU g of genomic or 1  MU g of cosmid DNA were digested with restriction enzymes using conditions and quantities recommended by the supplier (New England BioLabs).
      <br/>
      The digested DNA samples were size separated on agarose gels, transferred onto Hybond (tm)  nylon membranes (Amersham), and hybridized with probes labelled to high specific activity (5 * 108 cpm/ MU g of DNA) with  ALPHA -32 P-dATP (Amersham, specific activity&gt;3,000 Ci/mmol) under high stringency conditions.
      <br/>
      All Nramp derived probes were preannealed with 400  MU g of human placental DNA in 1 ml hybridization medium for 1 hour at 65 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      The identification of such a polymorphism can serve as the basis for the study of the association of defect in Nramp and susceptibility/resistance of individuals to tuberculosis.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the polymorphism can be cloned by screening a genomic human library using well-known, subcloning and screening procedures.
      <br/>
      The desired clone can be followed with the ApaI- RFLP using standard conditions.
      <br/>
      Once obtained, this genomic clone can be used to obtain subclones and sequence the DNA around the Apa-1 site.
      <br/>
      Sequencing is performed by routine methods, and permits the identification of the site of the RFLP, within the coding region or within intron sequences.
      <br/>
      The sequences flanking the RFLP, can be used to derive oligonucleotide primers for PCR analysis of human DNA, and/or, if the RFLP is shown to be present within the coding region, RT-PCR can be used with oligonucleotide derived from the sequencing analysis.
      <br/>
      It follows that the sequencing analysis can also identify the molecular basis for the RFLP.
      <br/>
      Other methods such as single strand conformation analysis (SSCA) can be used in order to analyse whether the sequence variants are associated with human susceptibility to tuberculosis, leprosy, typhoid fever, and Kala Azar.
