    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="6">The present invention comprises an apparatus for fastening a cover to an article, such as a potted plant.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus comprises a platform having an upper support surface formed thereon and at least one opening extending through the upper support surface.
      <br/>
      The upper support surface is adapted to support at least one sheet of material in a cover forming position over the opening.
      <br/>
      The opening is sized to accommodate a cover forming mold.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The apparatus further comprises a cover forming mold disposed below the opening in the support surface.
      <br/>
      The cover forming mold has contacting portions for contacting the sheet of material.
      <br/>
      The opening and the cover forming mold are adapted for receiving an article such as a flower pot having an upper end, a lower end, an upper opening and an outer peripheral surface such that when the article is moved in a pre-determined direction, such as downward, the lower end of the article is caused to engage a portion of the sheet of material disposed over the opening.
      <br/>
      The article and portions of the sheet of material thus pass into the cover forming mold causing the sheet of material to engage the outer peripheral surface of the article and the contacting portions of the cover forming mold as the article is moved.
      <br/>
      As this happens, portions of the sheet contactingly engage or nearly engage the outer peripheral surface of the article forming a cover about the article and thereby forming a covered article.
      <br/>
      The cover of the covered article then has an inner surface facing the outer peripheral surface of the article and an exposed outer surface adjacent the inner portion of the mold.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The apparatus further comprises a fastening device for automatically applying a fastener about a portion of the outer surface of the covered article.
      <br/>
      The fastening device comprises a fastener retraction assembly for grasping and retracting the fastener for clearing the fastener from the opening to allow clearance for insertion of a pot or article into the opening.
      <br/>
      In an alternate version, the apparatus may comprise a labeling assembly for automatically applying a label to a portion of the outer surface of the cover of the covered article, preferably after the cover has been fastened to the article.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The sheet of material used in accordance with the present invention is constructed from a material selected from a group of materials described in greater detail below.
      <br/>
      The apparatus may further comprise a securing assembly for releasably securing the sheet of material in the cover forming position on the upper support surface for generally immobilizing the sheet prior to the forming step.
      <br/>
      The apparatus may further comprise a sheet feeder for automatically placing a sheet of material on the support surface and/or a pick an place assembly for picking up the article from an article supply and for placing the article into the opening to form the covered article.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the apparatus may further comprise a removal assembly for automatically removing the covered article from the opening of the platform.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The present invention further comprises a method for processing an article, such as a flower pot or potted plant.
      <br/>
      The first step comprises providing a platform such as described above which has an upper support surface formed thereon and at least one opening extending through the support surface.
      <br/>
      The opening is sized exactly as described above and has a cover forming mold disposed therein.
      <br/>
      Each cover forming mold has contacting portions and is sized to receive an article such as a potted plant which has an upper end, a lower end, an opening, and an outer peripheral surface.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The next step comprises placing a sheet of material in a cover forming position over the opening.
      <br/>
      The sheet of material, in the cover forming position, is positioned over the cover forming mold in the opening.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In the next step, a potted plant is covered with the sheet of material by positioning the potted plant in a position over the sheet of material and disposing the lower end of the pot generally above and near the portion of the sheet of material which is above the cover forming mold.
      <br/>
      The pot is moved in a direction which causes the lower end of the pot to engage a portion of the sheet of material.
      <br/>
      The sheet of material is thereby caused to contact or nearly contact both the outer peripheral surface of the pot and the contacting portions of the cover forming mold as the pot is moved.
      <br/>
      The sheet is pressed about the outer peripheral surface of the pot to form a cover about the pot.
      <br/>
      The cover has an inner surface facing the outer peripheral surface of the pot and an outer surface facing the interior of the mold.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Following this, a fastener is automatically applied about a portion of the outer surface of the covered pot for fastening the cover about the pot.
      <br/>
      Then, if a labeling assembly is included as a component of the apparatus a label is automatically applied to a portion of the outer surface of the cover of the covered pot for labeling the covered pot.
      <br/>
      Finally, the covered pot is removed from the opening.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the step of automatically applying a label may occur prior to the step of automatically applying a fastener.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In an alternative embodiment, the step of placing a sheet of material on the support surface may be performed automatically using an automatic sheet feeding assembly.
      <br/>
      Also, the step of forming a covered article may be performed automatically by using an automatic pick and place assembly to pick up an article and place it into the opening to form the covered article.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the step of removing the covered article may further comprise automatically removing the covered article from the opening of the platform.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The machine may be located on any axis and may be portable or stationary.
      <br/>
      The machine can use pre-cut sheets fed manually or automatically with a dispenser which feeds a sized sheet from a roll to the proper working position on the machine table.
      <br/>
      The fastening apparatus may also tie the knot on a radius or on a tangent to the object.
