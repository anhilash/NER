    <p num="2">The invention relates to a ring-substituted derivative of K-252a for use in methods directed to ameliorating the deleterious effects of a variety of diseases, disorders and conditions.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      I.
      <br/>
      The Indolocarbazole K-252a
    </p>
    <p num="4">K-252a is a compound having an indolocarbazole skeleton �Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 41489/85 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,555,402)� with the stereochemistry shown in Formula I.  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="5">
      It has been reported that K-252a strongly inhibits protein kinase C (PKC) which plays a central role in regulating cell functions, and has various activities such as the action of inhibiting smooth muscle contraction (Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 43 (suppl.): 284, 1987), the action of inhibiting elongation of neurazone (J.
      <br/>
      Neuroscience, 8: 715, 1988), the action of inhibiting histamine release (Allergy, 43: 100, 1988), the action of inhibiting smooth muscle MLCK (J.
      <br/>
      Biol. Chem., 263: 6215, 1988), anti-inflammatory action (Acta Physiol.
      <br/>
      Hung., 80: 423, 1992), and the activity of cell survival (J.
      <br/>
      Neurochemistry, 64: 1502, 1995).
      <br/>
      It has also been disclosed in Experimental Cell Research, 193: 175-182, 1991, that K-252a has the activity of inhibiting IL-2 production.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In addition, it has been reported that derivatives of K-252a have PCK inhibitory activity, the activity of inhibiting histamine release (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 295588/88), antitumor activity �Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 168689/89 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,776), WO 88/07045 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,923,986), WO 94/04541�, the action of increasing blood platelets �WO 94/06799 (EP 630898A)�, vasodepressor activity (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 120388/87), the action of accelerating cholinergic neuron functions �WO 94/02488 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,461,146 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,621,100)� and, curative effect on prostate cancer �WO 94/27982 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,516,771)�. Selected amino-containing trindene compounds have been prepared by Beckmann rearrangement of the corresponding staurosporine oximes (WO 97/05140).</p>
    <p num="7">
      The indolocarbazoles are generally lypophilic.
      <br/>
      Because of this feature, the indolocarbazoles are able to cress biological membranes with relative ease, compared to proteins.
      <br/>
      Also indolocarbazoles generally have longer in vivo half lives than proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In addition to K-252a itself, various derivatives of K-252a have been synthesized and tested for biological activity.
      <br/>
      Among the K-252a derivatives shown to have biological activity is a compound disclosed in Lewis et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,461,146, and 5,621,100, and PCT Publication WO 94/02488, and designated therein as "Compound II-51." Compound II-51 has been shown to enhance the function of cholinergic neurons, striatal neurons, and sensory neurons.
    </p>
    <p num="9">II. Neurodegenerative Diseases and Disorders</p>
    <p num="10">
      Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that involves progressive and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons of the nigro-striatal pathway (Agid, Lancet: 337:1991).
      <br/>
      Administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,4,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to mice leads to dopaminergic neuron degeneration and serves as an animal model for the dopaminergic neuronal loss and behavioral deficits observed in Parkinson's disease.
      <br/>
      Peripheral administration of MPTP leads to a highly selective degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal system in humans, monkeys and mice (Heikkila et al., Science 224; 1451-1453, 1984; Burns et al., Proc Natl.
      <br/>
      Acad. Sci. USA 80:4546-4550, 1983).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Neurodegeneration in the MPTP mouse model has been well-characterized.
      <br/>
      Systemic administration of MPTP produces selective loss of dopamine content (and metabolites), tyrosine hydroxylase activity, and dopamine uptake sites in dopaminergic neurons of the murine striatum (Heikkila et al., Nature 311:467-469, 1984a,b; Tipton et al., J. Neurochem. 61:1191-1206, 1993).
      <br/>
      This effect is dose-dependent.
      <br/>
      Maximal loss occurs between 3 and 7 days post-lesion (Jackson-Lewis et al., Neurodegeneration 4:257-269, 1995).
      <br/>
      The dopaminergic cell bodies in the nigra are less sensitive to MPTP toxicity than their corresponding nerve terminals.
      <br/>
      At high MPTP doses, or multiple MPTP injections, substantial loss of TH immunopositive cells in the substantia nigra occurs within a week (Heikkila et al., Science 224; 1451-1453, 1984; Jackson-Lewis et al., Neurodegeneration 4:257-269, 1995).
      <br/>
      At lower MPTP doses, or with a single injection, loss of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells occurs later (Tatton et al., J. Neuroscience.
      <br/>
      Res. 30:666-672, 1991).
      <br/>
      Thus, at lower doses of MPTP and a short-time period after lesion, striatal damage can be observed in the absence of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cell loss.
      <br/>
      This neurodegenerative sequence is similar to that observed in the disease.
      <br/>
      The MPTP mouse model is a recognized and widely used model for the study of Parkinson's disease.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Non-cholinergic neurons that use  GAMMA -aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a neurotransmitter (i.e., GABA-ergic neurons) are widespread throughout the brain.
      <br/>
      For example, they are found in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis in the rodent (the equivalent region in the human brain is called nucleus basalis of Meynert), a region of the basal forebrain important in attention and memory functions.
      <br/>
      Damage to GABA-ergic neurons in the basal forebrain may also contribute to behavioral deficits in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (Dekker et al., Neurosci. and Biobehav.
      <br/>
      Rev., 15:299-317, 1991; Gallagher et al., Seminars in Neuroscience, 6;351-358, 1994; Torres et al., Neuroscience, 63:95-122, 1994).
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Neurons in the basal forebrain die in several diseases of the central nervous system, notably Alzheimer's disease (Arendt et al., Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.) 61:101-108, 1983; Iraizoz et al., Neuroscience, 41:33-40, 1991; Vogels et al., Neurobiol.
      <br/>
      Aging, 11:3-13, 1990).
      <br/>
      A contributing factor in such neuronal cell death is glutamate excitotoxity, i.e. over-stimulation of neurons by excess glutamate (Choi, Neuron, 1:623-634, 1988).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, several animal models of Alzheimer's disease use glutamate or a glutamate analog to produce excitotoxic death in the region of the basal forebrain where neuron death occurs, i.e., the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (Wenk, Beh. Brain Res., 72:17-24, 1996).
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Neuronal pathology in Alzheimer's disease is first seen in the entorhinal cortex, and loss of neurons in this region becomes severe as the disease progresses (Braak et al., Acta Neuropathol. 82:239-259, 1991; Hyman et al., Ann. Neurol. 20:472-481, 1986).
      <br/>
      Neurons in layer 2 of the entorhinal cortex project to the dentate syrus of the hippocampus, and this neuronal pathway plays an important role in memory formation (Levisohn et al., Brain Res. 564:230-244, 1991; Olton et al., Brain Res. 139:295-308, 1978; Steward et al., Brain Res.
      <br/>
      Bull. 2:41-48, 1977).
      <br/>
      Neurons in layer 2 of the entorhinal cortex, like many other neurons in the cerebral cortex, use glutamate as a neurotransmitter (Mattson et al., Neuron 1:865-876, 1988; White et al., Nature 270:356-357, 1977).
      <br/>
      Thus, loss of flutamatergic neurons in the entorhinal cortex contributes to the behavioural deficits seen in Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders.
    </p>
    <p num="15">III. Peripheral Neuropathy</p>
    <p num="16">
      Peripheral neuropathy generally refers to a disorder that affects the peripheral nerves, most often manifested as one or a combination of motor, sensory, sensorimotor, or autonomic neural dysfunction.
      <br/>
      The wide variety of morphologies exhibited by peripheral neuropathies can each be uniquely attributed to an equally wide variety of causes.
      <br/>
      For instance, peripheral neuropathies can be genetically acquired, can result from a systemic disease, or can be induced by a toxic agent.
      <br/>
      Some toxic agents that cause neurotoxicities are therapeutic drugs, antineoplastic agents, contaminants in foods or medicinals, and environmental and industrial pollutants.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In particular, chemotherapeutic agents known to cause sensory and/or motor neuropathies include vineristine, an antineoplastic drug used to treat haematological malignancies and sarcomas.
      <br/>
      The neurotoxicity is dose-related, and exhibits as reduced intestinal motility and peripheral neuropathy, expecially in the distal muscles of the hands and feet, postural hypotension, and atony of the urinary bladder.
      <br/>
      Similar problems have been documented with taxol and cisplatin (Mollman, 1990, New Eng.
      <br/>
      Jour. Med. 322:126-127), although cisplatin-related neurotoxicity can be alleviated with nerve growth factor (NGF) (Apfel, et al., 1992, Annals of Neurology 31:76-80).
      <br/>
      Although the neurotoxicity is sometimes reversible after removal of the neurotoxic agent, recovery can be a very slow process (Legha, 1986, Medical Toxicology 1:421-427; Olesen, et al., 1991, Drug Safety 6:302-314).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      There are a number of inherited peripheral neuropathies, including: Rofsum's disease, A-betalipoproteinemia, Tangier disease, Krabbe's disease, Metachromatic leukodystrophy, Fabry's disease, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome, and others.
      <br/>
      Of all the inherited neuropathies, the most common by far is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (see also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,420,112 for additional information on peripheral neuropathies).
    </p>
    <p num="19">IV. Cytokines</p>
    <p num="20">
      Tumor necrosis factor  ALPHA  (TNF- ALPHA ) and interleukin-1 BETA  (IL-1 BETA ) are polypeptides known to be involved in a number of inflammatory and metabolic processes in vivo.
      <br/>
      For a review which relates the role of TNF- ALPHA  in inflammatory diseases, including septic shock, see Ann.

      Rev. Immunol. 7:625 (1980), and Clinical Trials for the Treatment of Sepsis, Sibbald, W. J. and Vincent, J.-L. (Eds.), Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1995.
      <br/>
      It is generally accepted that the overproduction or inappropriate production of TNF- ALPHA  is involved in several pathological conditions, including septic shock (Spooner et al., Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology, 62:p.
      <br/>
      S11 (1992)) and various other allergic and inflammatory conditions or diseases, including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive airway disease, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis, dermatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune diseases.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">Generally, the invention features methodologies for ameliorating the deleterious effects of a variety of diseases, disorders and conditions by treating a subject in need thereof with a therapeutically effective amount of compound A.</p>
    <p num="22">
      More specifically, the invention features a method for treating the deleterious effects of diseases, disorders and conditions which lead to or cause the death of, or lead to or cause inhibition of the function of, certain neurons by enhancing the function or survival of a dopaminergic, GABA-ergic, or glutamatergic neuron in a mammal, comprising the step of contacting the neuron with Compound A. Typically, the mammal in which the neuron is found in a human.
      <br/>
      Typically, the dopaminergic, GABA-ergic, or glutamatergic neuron contacted with Compound A has impaired function, or is at risk of dying, because of a neurodegenerative disease.
      <br/>
      Typically, the neurodegenerative disease is Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.
    </p>
    <p num="23">More specifically, the invention also features a method of reducing a peripheral neuropathy comprising administering to a mammal a neuropathy-reducing amount of Compound A.</p>
    <p num="24">
      While it has been reported that the indolocarbazole compound K-252a reduces the lethality resulting from endotoxin administration, this ability has been ascribed to the ability of K-252a to inhibit protein kinases, especially protein kinase C (Inaba et al., Jpn. J. Surg 23:234 (1993).
      <br/>
      It has unexpectedly been found that Compound A, which has little or no inhibitory activity against PKC, provides surprisingly good activity as an inhibitor of TNF- ALPHA  production and production of the cytokine IL-1 BETA .
      <br/>
      Therefore, and with further specificity, the invention also features a method of inhibiting production of TNF- ALPHA  and IL-1 BETA  in a mammal and a method of treating or alleviating inflammatory conditions or diseases, including but not limited to septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive airway disease, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis, dermatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune diseases, which method comprises administering to said mammal an effective amount of Compound A and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

    <p num="25">As used herein, "Compound A" means the compound whose chemical structure is shown below.  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="26">Compound A is also referred to as Compound II-51 (Lewis et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,461,146 and 5,621,100; WO 94/02488).</p>
    <p num="27">As used herein, "ameliorate" and "ameliorating" mean to therapeutically improve and/or therapeutically reduce and/or to make more therapeutically tolerable.</p>
    <p num="28">As used herein, "deleterious" means damaging and/or harmful and/or negative.</p>
    <p num="29">As used herein, the word "overproduction" when used to modify TNF- ALPHA  and IL-1 BETA  means production of TNF- ALPHA  and/or IL-1 BETA  leading to deleterious conditions such as, for example, septic shock, allergic conditions, inflammatory conditions, etc.</p>
    <p num="30">As used herein, the terms "inhibit" or "inhibiting" means that the presence of Compound A has a comparatively greater effect on reducing and/or prohibiting and/or preventing the production of a material contacted with Compound A than a comparative material not contacted with Compound A.</p>
    <p num="31">As used herein, the terms "enhance" or "enhancing" when used to modify the terms "function" or "survival" means that the presence of Compound A has a comparatively greater effect on the function and/or survival of the specified neuron that a comparative neuron not presented with Compound A. For example, and not by way of limitation, with respect to the survival of, e.g., a dopaminergic neuron, Compound A would evidence enhancement of the function of a dopaminergic neuronal population at risk of dying (due to, e.g., injury, a disease condition, a degenerative condition or natural progression) when compared to a dopaminergic neuronal population not presented with Compound A, if the treated population has a comparatively greater period of functionality than the non-treated population.</p>
    <p num="32">As used herein, "dopaminergic neuron" means a neuron that uses dopamine as a neurotransmitter.</p>
    <p num="33">As used herein, "GABA-ergic neuron" means a neuron that uses  BETA -aminobutyric acid as a neurotransmitter.</p>
    <p num="34">As used herein, "glutamatergic neuron" means a neuron that uses glutamate as a neurotransmitter.</p>

      More particularly, the invention provides a method for enhancing the function or survival of dopaminergic neurons, GABA-ergic neurons, and glutamatergic neurons in a mammal by administering to the mammal Compound A, a ring-substituted K-252a derivative with the following chemical structure:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Dopaminergic neurons, GABA-ergic neurons, and glutamatergic neurons are widespread in the mammalian central nervous system.
      <br/>
      Each of these three neuronal cell types suffers impaired function, or even death, in one or more neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system.
      <br/>
      Parkinson's disease involves progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway.
      <br/>
      Alzheimer's disease involves the death of various types of neurons, including GABA-ergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert of the basal forebrain.
      <br/>
      Alzheimer's disease also involves death of glutamatergic neurons in the entorhinal cortex.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      One method of treating Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease is to administer a compound that enhances the function or survival of dopaminergic neurons, GABA-ergic neurons, or glutamatergic neurons.
      <br/>
      Compound A is pharmacologically active in biological assays and in vivo models for enhanced function or survival of dopaminergic neurons, GABA-ergic neurons, and glutamatergic neurons.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the present invention has utility for treating Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.
      <br/>
      The invention, however, is not limited to the treatment of those diseases.
      <br/>
      The use of Compound A to enhance the function or survival of dopaminergic neurons, GABA-ergic neurons, or glutamatergic neurons whose impaired function or risk of dying results from causes other than Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease is also within the scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      This invention also features a method of reducing a peripheral neuropath.
      <br/>
      The method involves administering a neuropathy-reducing amount of Compound A to a mammal.
      <br/>
      In various preferred embodiments, the mammal is a human, or an agricultureal or domestic mammal that develops a neuropathy, e.g., as a result of treatment of a neoplasm with a chemotherapeutic agent.
      <br/>
      Compound A can be administered in a manner deemed effective by one skilled in the art; a preferred mode of administration is subcutaneous injection.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      As used herein, "peripheral neuropathy" refers to a disorder affecting a segment of the peripheral nervous system.
      <br/>
      The invention involves using Compound A to reduce a neurotoxicity, including, but not limited to, distal sensorimotor neuropathy, or autonomic neuropathies such as reduced motility of the gastrointestinal tract or atony of the urinary bladder.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Preferred neuropathies that can be effectively treated with Compound A include neuropathies associated with systemic disease, e.g., post-polio syndrome; genetically acquired neuropathies, e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; and neuropathies caused by a toxic agent, e.g., acrylamide, or a chemotherapeutic agent, e.g., vincristine.</p>
    <p num="45">
      Where Compound A is used to treat a neuropathy induced by a toxic agent, it can be administered before, simultaneously with, or after exposure to the toxic agent, or before, during or after administration of a chemotherapeutic.
      <br/>
      Preferably, Compound A and the chemotherapeutic agent are each administered at effective time intervals, during an overlapping period of treatment.
      <br/>
      Compound A can be administered to the mammal following exposure to the neurotoxic agent, or following chemotherapy, to restore at least a portion of the neurofunction destroyed by the neurotoxic agent or chemotherapeutic.
      <br/>
      The chemotherapeutic can be any chemotherapeutic agent that causes neurotoxicity, such as vincristine, taxol, dideoxyinosine, or cisplatin.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      By "toxic agent" or "neurotoxic agent," is meant a substance that through its chemical action injures, impairs, or inhibits the activity of a component of the nervous system.
      <br/>
      The list of neurotoxic agents that cause neuropathies is lengthy, and includes, but is not limited to, neoplastic agents such as vincristine, vinblastine, cisplatin, taxol, or dideoxy-compounds, e.g., dideoxyinosine; alcohol; metals; industrial toxins involved in occupational or environmental exposure; contaminants of food or medicinals; or over-doses of vitamins or therapeutic drugs, e.g., antibiotics such as penicillan or chloramphenicol, or megadoses of vitamins A, D, or B6.
      <br/>
      An extensive, although not complete, list of chemical compounds with neurotoxic side-effects is found in Table 1.
      <br/>
      Although this list provides examples of neurotoxic compounds, it is intended to exemplify, not limit, the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Other toxic agents can cause neuropathies, and can be characterized by methods known to one skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      By "exposure to a toxic agent" is meant that the toxic agent is made available to, or comes into contact with, a mammal of the invention.
      <br/>
      Exposure to a toxic agent can occur by direct administration, e.g., by ingestion or administration of a food, medicinal, or therapeutic agent, e.g., a chemotherapeutic agent, by accidental contamination, or by environmental exposure, e.g., aerial or aqueous exposure.
    </p>
    <p num="47">Despite the widely disparate morphologies and causes attributed to peripheral neuropathies in vivo, applicants have hypothesized that Compound A can be an effective means of preventing or treating such neuropathies in a mammal.</p>

      Compound A has also been demonstrated to inhibit production of the cytokine TNF- ALPHA , despite having little or no inhibitory activity against PKC.
      <br/>
      Compound A also inhibits the production of the cytokine IL-1 BETA .
      <br/>
      The production of TNF- ALPHA  is associated with a variety of diseases and disorders such that the inhibition thereof via use of Compound A can beneficially provide value to a subject in need of such inhibition of TNF- ALPHA  production.

    <p num="50">Accordingly, Compound A can also be utilized to inhibit production of TNF- ALPHA  in a mammal and/or a method of treating or alleviating inflammatory conditions or disease, including but not limited to septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive airway disease, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis, dermatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune diseases which method comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of Compound A.</p>
    <p num="51">
      For use in the present invention, Compound A can be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition by admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic excipients and carriers.
      <br/>
      Such a composition can be prepared for administration by any of various routes.
      <br/>
      Routes of administration and preferred dosage forms include the following: parenteral, preferably in the form of liquid solutions of suspensions; oral, preferably in the form of tablets of capsules; intranasal, preferably particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols; and dermal, via, for example, trans-dermal patches.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Composition A can be conveniently administered in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmaceutical art, for example, as described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa., 1980).
      <br/>
      Formulations for parenteral administration may contain as common excipients sterile water or saline, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils and vegetable origin, hydrogenated naphthalenes and the like.
      <br/>
      In particular, biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymer, lactide/glycolide copolymer, or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers may be useful excipients to control the release of the active compounds.
      <br/>
      Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for Compound A include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes, Formulations for inhalation administration contain as excipients, for example, lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel to be applied intranasally.
      <br/>
      Formulations for parenteral administration may also include glycocholate for buccal administration, a salicylate for rectal administration, or citric acid for vaginal administration.
      <br/>
      Formulations for trans-dermal patches are preferably lipophilic emulsions.

      Compound A can be employed as the sole active ingredient in a pharmaceutical composition.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, it can be used in combination with other active ingredients, e.g., growth factors that facilitate neuronal survival or axonal regeneration in diseases or disorders.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The concentration of Compound A used in the practice of this invention in a therapeutic composition can vary.
      <br/>
      The concentration will depend upon factors such as the total dosage of the drug to be administered and the route of administration.
      <br/>
      Compound A typically would be provided in an aqueots physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to 10% w/v for parenteral administration.
      <br/>
      Typical dose ranges are from about 1  MU g/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day; a preferred dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of body weight per day.
      <br/>
      A preferred dosage of Compound A to be administered is likely to depend on variables such as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative efficacy of Compound A for the particular disease or disorder treated, the particular formulation used, and its route of administration.

      Ibotenic acid, an excitotoxin, is known to reduce numbers of GABA-expressing neurons in the nbm region (Lindefors et al., Neurosci. Lett., 135:262-264, 1992; Shaugnessy et al., Brain Res., 637:15-26, 1994).
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received injections of ibotenic acid (5.0 g) into the nbm unilaterally.
      <br/>
      The rats were then dosed with Compound A (0.03 mg/kg) via subcutaneous injection beginning 18 hours after the lesion, and continuing q.o.d. until 18 days post-lesion.
      <br/>
      Tissue sections were then collected throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the nbm, and processed to detect glutamic acid decarboxylase, an enzyme required for biosynthesis of GABA.
      <br/>
      The numbers of neurons expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase were then counted throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, in a region where glutamic acid decarboxylase-expressing neurons of the nbm are easily distinguished from glutamic acid decarboxylase-expressing neurons in adjacent structures (white matter medial and ventral to the globus pallidus).
      <br/>
      The results were expressed as percent glutamic acid decarboxylase-expressing neurons on the lesioned side relative to the number on the opposite, unlesioned side.
      <br/>
      The results were also calculated separately for the rostral nbm, mid-nmb, and caudal nbm.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      A mean of 78 ( +- 16 s.c.m.) percent glutamic acid decarboxylase neurons were counted in the rostral nbm of animals receiving Compound A, compared to 34 ( +- 19 s.e.m.) percent in animals receiving vehicle only, a statistically significant difference by t test (p&lt;0.05).
      <br/>
      No statistically significant differences between Compound A-treated animals and vehicle-only (control) animals were seen in mid-nbm or caudal nbm.
    </p>
    <p num="71">These results demonstrate that Compound A can protect against a GABA-ergic neuron loss that results from an excitotoxic lesion, and thus has a neurotrophic effect on that neuronal population.</p>

      Pharmacological Activity on nbm Neurons
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      To test directly the ability of Compound A to prevent excitotoxic neuron death, nbm neurons in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were first labeled with a long-lasting marker.
      <br/>
      This was done by injecting Fluoro-Gold (FG), a neuronal tracer that is taken up by nerve terminals and transported back to the cell body (Book et al., J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurology, 53:95-102, 1994), into target regions of nbm neurons in the frontal and parietal cortex. 7-10 days later the animals received lesion of the nbm unilaterally, using 5  MU g of ibotenic acid.
      <br/>
      Beginning 18 hours after this lesion, the animals received Compound A (0.03 mg/kg) via subcutaneous injection, every other day until 18 days post-lesion.
      <br/>
      Tissue sections were collected throughout the entire rostral-caudal extent of the nbm on both sides of the brain, and numbers of nbm neurons with the FG label were counted.
      <br/>
      The counts were corrected for size differences using standard procedures, and the results expressed as the percent of labeled neurons in the nbm on the lesioned side of each animal relative to the number of labeled neurons in the nbm on the opposite unlesioned side of the brain.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Animals receiving compound A had significantly more FG-labeled neurons in the rostral portion of the lesioned nbm (over 400  MU m from the mid-point of the lesion), compared to lesioned animals receiving vehicle only (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      At mid-lesion and caudal to the lesion Compound A had a declining effect.
    </p>
    <p num="75">These results demonstrate directly that Compound A can prevent the loss of pre-labeled neurons in the nbm that results from excitotoxic damage.</p>

      Long-Lasting Functional Improvement Upon Short Term Dosing with Compound A
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were first trained to alternate responses in a standard rewarded-alternation T-maze task (Hepler et al., J. Neurosci., 5:866-873, 1985).
      <br/>
      The animals then received bilateral lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, to impair performance in T-maze tasks (e.g., Salamone et al., Behav. Brain Res., 13:63-70, 1984).
      <br/>
      Beginning 18 hours after the lesion, the animals received Compound A via subcutaneous injection (0.1 mg/kg) every other day until 12 days post-lesion.
      <br/>
      Twenty-four hours following the last injection all animals were placed in the T-maze once a day, until their alternation performance reached pre-operative levels, which took anywhere from 3 to 10 days.
      <br/>
      After reaching criterion, the animals were not further tested for 8-10 weeks.
      <br/>
      At that point the animals were again placed in the T-maze, once a day until they reached pre-operative performance.
      <br/>
      The total number of errors the animals committed during this test is shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The lesioned animals receiving vehicle only committed significantly more errors than either unoperated normals or sham-operates, while lesioned animals that received Compound A 10-12 weeks previously were not different from normals.
    </p>
    <p num="78">These results demonstrate that Compound A produces a chronic improvement in a behavior reflective of an improvement in attention or memory several months after dosing has ceased.</p>

      Efficiency of Compound A in Entorhinal Cortex Lesion Model
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      Glutamate-containing neurons in layer 2 of the entorhinal cortex project to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, where they form synapses on the dendrites of the dentate gyrus granule cells.
      <br/>
      A lesion can be created in layer 2 of entorhinal cortex by stereotaxic injection of the excitotoxin N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA).
      <br/>
      Under sodium pentobarbitol anesthesia, rats received an injection of NMDA (15 nmols/site) at each of 2 sites in the entorhinal cortex.
      <br/>
      Two weeks later, the rats were sacrificed and perfused with a 50 mM sodium sulfide solution.
      <br/>
      The brains were removed, sectioned in the horizontal plane at a thickness of 40  MU m, and stained with either Cresyl violet or Timm'stain.
      <br/>
      The survival of neurons in layer 2 of entorhinal cortex was assessed in Cresyl violet stained sections, while the integrity of their axon terminals in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus was measured in alternate sections stained with Timm's stain.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      Injection of NMDA destroyed 62 +- 11% (s.e.m.) of entorhinal layer 2 and decreased the area of the dentate gyrus middle molecular layer by 19 +- 6% (s.e.m.).
      <br/>
      Daily treatment with Compound A (1 mg/kg, s.c.), with the first injection given immediately after injection of NMDA, reduced the loss of entorhinal layer 2 neurons to 22 +- 10% (s.e.m.)(p&lt;0.05, `t` test) and prevented the decrease in area of the middle molecular layer (p&lt;0.05, `t` test).
      <br/>
      Thus, Compound A protected neurons in the entorhinal cortex from an excitotoxic lesion and maintained the integrity of their axon terminals in the dentate gyrus.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      These data demonstrate the efficacy of Compound A in protecting glutamatergic neurons of the entorhinal cortex.
      <br/>
      Lesions of entorhinal cortex in animal models have been shown to produce memory deficits, and severe degeneration of these neurons occurs in Alzheimer's disease.
      <br/>
      This supports the position that Compound A is useful in treating neurological disorders that involve loss of or damage to glutamatergic neurons and neurons of the cerebral cortex, including but not limited to Alzheimer's disease, stroke and head trauma.

      Effect of Compound A on Acrylamide-Induced peripheral Neuropathy
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Acrylamide produces a "dying back" central-peripheral distal neuropathy in humans and animals.
      <br/>
      The lesion is a mixed sensory/motor neuropathy characterized by weakness, tremor and ataxia in humans.
      <br/>
      In animals, acrylamide produces changes in behavior (sensory, motor and proprioceptive), histopathology, electrophysiology and weight loss.
      <br/>
      In the periphery, large diameter, long axon, Ab fibers are preferentially affected by acrylamide.
      <br/>
      In rats, acrylamide administration produces an axonopathy as measured by increased landing foot spread (LFS), a measure of proprioception.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      Acrylamide-induced neuropathy is a model of chemically induced toxicity.
      <br/>
      It differs from other chemically-induced models (such as chemotherapeutic models) in that the duration is relatively short (3 weeks) and the animals are in relatively good health.
      <br/>
      Acrylamide does not produce gross systemic toxicity.
