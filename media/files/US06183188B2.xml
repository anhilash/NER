      A manually operated pallet changer system for use with automatic machine tools includes a pallet changer and a compatible machine tool mounted pallet receiver.
      <br/>
      The pallet changer includes a massive, floor supported base to which a cantilevered first platform is pivotally attached for rotation between a pallet-exchange position and a work-setup position.
      <br/>
      A second platform rests atop the first platform and supports a pair of work pallet guides.
      <br/>
      The two platforms are rotatably attached near their centers so that the pallet guides can be interchanged by rotating the upper platform about its center by 180°.
      <br/>
      The configuration permits the platforms to be rotated as a unit away from a machine tool to the work-setup position.
      <br/>
      Work pallets are assembled and then the platforms are rotated together into the pallet-exchange position in which one of the pallet guides is aligned for transferring a work pallet to the machine tool mounted pallet receiver.
      <br/>
      The receiver includes an air bearing upper surface for simplifying the movement and positioning of a work pallet, a deployable clamping plate, and a pair of retractable locating pins for engaging openings on the underside of a work pallet to insure precision alignment during a machining operation.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to a work pallet changer, and in particular to a manually operated work pallet changer system.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Background of the Invention</p>
    <p num="4">
      In machine shops using large, expensive automatic machine tools, such as the Vertical Machining Center, the Horizontal Machine Center, and Drilling and Tapping machines, it is desirable to keep the machine tool busy in order to make it an effective and efficient investment.
      <br/>
      Many machine shops have adopted the use of work pallet changers also known as pallet indexers.
      <br/>
      The use of a pallet indexer permits a machine tool operator to assemble the work on portable pallets and to efficiently move the work to and from a machine tool work table by transferring assembled work pallets.
      <br/>
      This procedure avoids unnecessary downtime otherwise required to setup and teardown the work directly on the work table.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Using such an indexer, a new work pallet is setup off line while the machining proceeds on a previously assembled work pallet.
      <br/>
      The indexer is then used to quickly remove a pallet and its completed work from the machine tool and to replace it with the newly setup work pallet.
      <br/>
      The machine tool is inoperative only during the short time required to exchange the work pallets.
      <br/>
      In this way the machine tool is kept busy, and the owner's investment is maximized.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A variety of devices and methods have been proposed for this purpose.
      <br/>
      Among these devices are a class of pallet indexers which operate on a shuttle or side-by-side principle, as for example the pallet changer illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,156,254. Another popular class of pallet indexers uses a rotary or carousel principle, as illustrated for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,018,617.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Some indexers are manually operated, while many others are semi-automatic or even fully automatic in operation.
      <br/>
      Though these pallet indexers achieve the goal of keeping the machine tool busy, they tend to suffer from two major problems which undermine the goal of maximizing the owner's investment.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The first problem relates to the manner in which the side-to-side indexers interfere with a machine tool operator's ability to physically monitor the work in progress.
      <br/>
      These shuttle-type indexers often include a portion connecting two side units.
      <br/>
      That portion extends outwardly from the machine tool near a position at which the machine tool operator must stand in order to effectively observe and monitor the machining operation.
      <br/>
      In such cases, the machine tool operator must lean across this connecting portion in order to observe and listen to the work as it proceeds.
      <br/>
      Though it is possible for the machinist to work in this manner, the leaning-across increases fatigue and interferes with both his efficiency and his ability to use skills effectively to insure the machining is properly carried out.
      <br/>
      This shortcoming tends to be present in both the manually operated and the automatic indexers of the side-to-side configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The second common problem relates to the complexity of the automatic and the semi-automatic indexers, and even many of the manually operated devices.
      <br/>
      These indexers are expensive to purchase and are often costly to maintain.
      <br/>
      What is gained in efficient machine shop operation, is lost in an increased, and often hidden cost for indexer maintenance and repair.
      <br/>
      As a result, the apparent savings are somewhat illusory, particularly in the smaller and mid-sized machine shop.
    </p>
    <p num="10">It would be desirable to provide a work pallet changer that is relatively inexpensive to purchase, that provides an increase in productivity by being easy to operate, that is configured to permit the machine tool operator to monitor the work without undue fatigue, and which presents the shop owner with few hidden costs related to upkeep.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      The present invention meets these requirements by providing a manually operated work pallet changer providing simple handling for a pair of work pallets.
      <br/>
      The pallet changer is inexpensive, is easy to install and to adjust, is easily maintained, and rotates out of the machinist's way once a work pallet exchange is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In a specific embodiment of one aspect of the invention, a manually operated work pallet changer includes a heavy, floor supported base.
      <br/>
      A horizontal platform is pivotally attached to the base, and defines a primary vertical axis extending through the center of the base.
      <br/>
      The horizontal platform rotates, with respect to the base and the primary axis, between a work pallet-setup position and a work pallet-exchange position.
      <br/>
      The horizontal platform extends outwardly from the primary axis in cantilever fashion.
      <br/>
      The outwardly extending portion of the platform includes a bearing which defines a second vertical axis parallel to the primary axis.
      <br/>
      A generally rectangular pallet guide platform is rotatably attached at the bearing, above and parallel to the horizontal platform, and is thus able to rotate around the secondary axis.
      <br/>
      A pair of work pallet guides are aligned in opposite directions on top of the pallet guide platform.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Rotation of the pallet guide platform about the secondary axis by 180 (degree)  brings first one and then the other work pallet guide into the work pallet-exchange position.
      <br/>
      Pivoting the horizontal platform around the primary axis shifts the pallet guide platform between the work pallet-exchange position and the work pallet-setup position, away from the machine tool.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In a specific embodiment of another aspect of the invention, an air-bearing work pallet receiver includes a planar top surface having a plurality of small openings connected through an automatic valve to a compressed gas.
      <br/>
      When the valve is opened, the gas is ejected through the small openings, forming an air-bearing surface which floats the heavy work pallets and facilitates their movement and careful alignment on the machine tool.
      <br/>
      The receiver also includes a deployable clamping plate which mates with a congruent opening formed on the underside of the work pallet.
      <br/>
      Once the deployed clamping plate has engaged the opening, the work pallet is retained against the lift of the air-bearing and is coarsely aligned atop the work pallet receiver.
      <br/>
      Finally, the receiver includes a pair of retractable locating pins which are withdrawn below the air-bearing surface while a work pallet is being moved and adjusted, and which are then extended into corresponding openings on the underside of the work pallet providing a precise and repeatable alignment during the machining operations.
      <br/>
      The clamping plate is then moved from a deployed receiving position to a work pallet clamping position.
    </p>
    <p num="15">In another embodiment of the invention, a manually operated work pallet changer system includes a pallet changer and an air-bearing work pallet receiver, as described above.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="17">
      With respect to FIG. 1 there is shown an exploded, perspective view of a manually operated work pallet changer according to a preferred embodiment of one aspect of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The manually operated pallet changer is designated generally by the numeral 10 and includes a static base mount 12, a pivoting base member 14, a primary support member 16, a guide support member 18, and a pair of work pallet guides 20 and 22.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The static base mount 12 is a massive support intended to rest upon a floor and to provide stability for the pallet changer 10.
      <br/>
      The static base mount 12 includes an upwardly extending shaft 24 for rotationally supporting the pivoting base member 14.
      <br/>
      Bearings (not shown) are located within the pivoting base member 14 for permitting rotation about the shaft 24 and defining a primary index axis 26 which is essentially vertical.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In a specific embodiment of the pallet changer 10, the static base mount 12 is circular at the base, having a diameter of 24 inches.
      <br/>
      The static base mount 12 weighs approximately 100 pounds.
      <br/>
      The upwardly extending shaft 24 has a diameter of approximately 2.25 inches, and the bearings (not shown) which connect the pivoting base member 14 to the shaft 24 are two tapered roller bearings, one near the lower end of the shaft 24, the other near the upper end, and providing both thrust and radial stability.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The primary support member 16 is essentially a square platform rigidly attached to an upper end of the rotating base member 14 and extending outwardly from the primary index axis 26.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the primary support member 16 measures 24 by 31 inches and is made of 5/8 inch drawn aluminum stock.
      <br/>
      The combination of the pivoting base member 14 and the primary support member 16 is sufficiently rigid to maintain the outwardly extending portion in a generally horizontal plane.
      <br/>
      In one alternative embodiment, a brace member extends between a lower portion of the pivoting base member 14 and the outwardly extending portion of the primary support member 16 (see FIG. 5).
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A bearing 28 is located near the center of the primary support member 16 and defines a secondary axis 30 parallel to the primary index axis 26.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the bearing 28 is a tapered roller bearing of approximately 2 inch diameter.
      <br/>
      A series of horizontal load bearing members 32 are arranged in a circle surrounding and set apart from the bearing 28 on an upper surface 33 of the primary support member 16.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the load bearing members 32 are polyurethane caster wheels on steel axles.
      <br/>
      Eight such members 32 are disposed in a circle of about 20" diameter, centered around the bearing 28 and sitting in wells in the surface 33.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The guide support member 18 conforms in shape to the primary support member 16 and rests on top of the horizontal bearing members 32.
      <br/>
      The guide support member 18 is attached near its center to the bearing 28 so that the guide support member 18 is free to rotate in a horizontal plane about the secondary axis 30.
      <br/>
      The pair of work pallet guides 20 and 22 are aligned near opposed corners 34, 36 of an upper surface 38 of the guide support member 18.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the guide support member 18 measures 31 inches by 31 inches and is made of 5/8 inch drawn aluminum stock.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In general use, the static base mount 12 of the manually operated work pallet changer 10 is positioned on the floor near the work station of an automatic machine tool (not shown).
      <br/>
      The guide support member 18, and the primary support member 16 are rotated as a single unit about the primary index axis 26 between a pallet-exchange position near the machine tool, and a work-setup position away from the machine tool.
      <br/>
      In use, a pair of assembled work pallets waiting to be machined (not shown) are located one on each work pallet guide 20, 22.
      <br/>
      At the work-setup position, the guide support member 18 and the work pallet guides 20, 22 are rotated 180 (degree)  about the secondary axis 30 to exchange the relative positions of the opposed work pallet guides.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 2 is a partial, perspective view illustrating an exchange of a work pallet 40 between the manually operated pallet changer 10 and an automatic machine tool, which is designated generally by the numeral 42.
      <br/>
      An air-bearing work pallet receiver 44 is located at a work station atop the machine tool 42, and receives and clamps the work pallet 40 in place throughout the machining operations.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated embodiment, a short pallet guide bridge 46 is used to temporarily connect the pallet changer 10 with the work pallet receiver 44 during the work pallet transfer.
      <br/>
      The work pallet 40 is machined from type MIC-6 aluminum micro casting, available from Alcoa and Reynolds.
      <br/>
      The finished work pallet 40 measures 20 inches wide by 16 inches deep by 1.25 inch thick.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The work pallet receiver 44 includes a T-shaped deployable clamping plate 47 which engages a conforming clamping slot 48 formed on the underside of the work pallet 40 as the work pallet 40 moves across the guide bridge 46 and onto the work pallet receiver 44.
      <br/>
      The clamping slot 48 is formed on the underside of the work pallet 40 by machining, and the micro-cast aluminum is preferred because of its ability to maintain its flatness after the clamping slot 48 has been machined into its bottom side.
      <br/>
      During the work pallet transfer from the pallet changer 10 to the machine tool 42, the cooperation of the deployable clamping plate 47 with the conforming clamping slot 48 guides the work pallet 40 into position atop the work pallet receiver 44.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      During the transfer, a compressed gas is inserted through a pipe 50 into a cavity (not shown) within the body of the work pallet receiver 44.
      <br/>
      The compressed gas is ejected through a plurality of small holes 52 located in an upper surface 53 of the work pallet receiver 44 creating an air-bearing for easing the movement of the heavy work pallet 40 during the transfer (an assembled work pallet may weigh as much as 200 pounds).
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the compressed gas is air under 100 pounds pressure.
      <br/>
      The small holes are 0.050 inch in diameter and a typical air-bearing surface includes approximately 16 to 20 such holes.
      <br/>
      The surface 53 is generally planar.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The work pallet receiver 44 also includes a pair of retractable locating pins 54, located near opposite corners.
      <br/>
      These locating pins are retracted below the air-bearing surface 53 during a work pallet transfer and then are raised into corresponding openings which are formed in the lower surface of the work pallet 40 and provide a positive locating reference with respect to the defined machine tool work station.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the locating pins 54 are stainless steel, approximately 0.75 inch in diameter and extending approximately 0.75 inch above the surface 53 when fully deployed.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIG. 3 is a perspective top view of a preferred embodiment of a work pallet receiver, designated generally by the numeral 51.
      <br/>
      The preferred work pallet receiver 51 differs slightly from the work pallet receiver illustrated in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In addition to the receiver 44, the air-bearing surface 53, the clamping plate 46, and the retractable locating pins 54, shown in a deployed position extending above the air-bearing surface 53, the preferred work pallet receiver 51 includes a guide bridge 55 having one end 57 permanently attached to a forward end 59 of the receiver 44.
      <br/>
      The attached guide bridge 55 includes a plurality of roller-type guide bearing members 61 made of 0.75 inch aluminum rods supported in polyurethane bushings at 2 inch centers.
      <br/>
      The same construction is used for the pallet guides 20, 22 of FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      When the preferred work pallet receiver 51 is used with the manually operated work pallet changer 10, forming a work pallet changer system, the temporary bridge 46 of FIG. 2 is not required.
      <br/>
      Instead, the permanently attached bridge 55 extends from the air-bearing surface 53 and the forward end 59 to a forward edge of the machine tool 42.
      <br/>
      The static base mount 12 (FIG. 1) of the manually operated work pallet changer 10 is positioned such that the primary and guide support members 16, 18 (FIG. 2) can be rotated to bring one work pallet guide 22 (FIG. 2) into close proximity with the receiver guide bridge 55.
      <br/>
      The assembled work pallet 40 (FIG. 2) is then moved by hand along the work pallet guide 22 and onto the receiver guide bridge 55 (FIG. 3) and finally onto the air-bearing surface 53 for engagement with the deployable clamping plate 47.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In a preferred embodiment, the receiver guide bridge 55 does not extend beyond a front edge of the machine tool 42 into a space normally occupied by the machinist, and thus does not interfere with his monitoring of the machining operation.
      <br/>
      The advantage of the permanently attached guide bridge 55 of FIG. 3 over the temporary guide bridge 46 of FIG. 2 is that the attached guide bridge does not require a separate place for storage when not in use, and is less likely to become lost or damaged.

      <br/>
      The primary support member 16 and the guide support member 18 are aligned with each other so that their square shapes are congruent and are rotated into the exchange position so that the pallet guide 22 is aligned with the work pallet receiver 44.
      <br/>
      A portion of the static base mount 12 extends beyond the support members 16, 18, and is located close to the machine tool 42 and to the left side of the work pallet receiver 44.
      <br/>
      A work pallet 40 is shown located on the pallet guide 22 and the temporary pallet guide bridge 46 connects between one end of the pallet guide 22 and the work pallet receiver 44.
      <br/>
      In this exchange position, the work pallet 40 can be manually shifted along the pallet guide 22 and the temporary guide bridge 46 onto the air-bearing surface of the work pallet receiver 44.
      <br/>
      The locating pins 54 are in the retracted position, and the clamping plate 47 is deployed into a receiving position.
      <br/>
      A second work pallet 56 is located on the pallet guide 20.

      The guide support member 18 has been rotated approximately an additional 100 (degree)  in the clockwise direction.
      <br/>
      The work pallet 40 has been transferred from the pallet guide 22 to the work pallet receiver 44.
      <br/>
      A machine tool operator 58 is now able to stand in the space between the rotated primary support member 16 and the machine tool 42, permitting the operator to closely observe the machine tool operation.

    <p num="37">
      When the valve 86 is rotated into the position shown, the compressed gas at the source line 92 is permitted to pass into the activation line 94 and moves into the chamber 90 above the piston 85, and into the chamber 96, emitting from the small openings 88 to create an air-bearing surface 89.
      <br/>
      The piston 85 is driven toward the lower end of the chamber 90 causing the attached locating pin 84 to retract into the work pallet receiver 82.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      FIG. 6B, the valve 86 has been rotated so that the compressed gas in the source line 92 is disconnected from the activation line 94 and is connected to a deploy line 98.
      <br/>
      The gas moves via line 98 into the chamber 90 below the piston 85, urging the piston 85 toward an upper end of the chamber 90 and extending the attached locating pin 84 above the surface 89 of the work pallet receiver 82.

      FIG. 7 is a cutaway end view showing the engagement of a deployed locating pin 54 within a compatible recess 63 in the underside of a work pallet 40.
      <br/>
      The locating pin 54 extends above the planar surface 53 of the work pallet receiver 44.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      FIG. 8 is an end view of a work pallet receiver 44 and a work pallet 40, illustrating engagement of the T-shaped deployable clamping plate 47 within the conforming clamping slot 48 on the underside of the work pallet 40.
      <br/>
      An overhanging ledge 100 of the deployable clamping plate 47 mates with a conforming undercut lip 102 of the clamping slot 48.
      <br/>
      The clamping plate 47 is movable a short distance both upward and downward in the vertical direction as indicated by the arrow 108.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      When moved upward to the full extent of its short range of vertical motion, the clamping plate 47 defines a "receiving" position (also referred to as "open" and "unlocked" position).
      <br/>
      In the receiving position, the clamping plate 47 does not interfere with the conforming clamping slot 48, permitting the work pallet 40 to be moved easily onto and off of the work pallet receiver 44.
      <br/>
      When the air-bearing is activated, lifting the work pallet 40, the ledge 100 and the lip 102 cooperate to retain the work pallet 40 against the lifting force of the air-bearing.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      When the clamping plate 47 is moved downward to the full extent of its vertical motion, the ledge 100 acts upon the lip 102, forcing the work pallet 40 down against the planar surface 53 of the work pallet receiver 44.
      <br/>
      This full downward position of the clamping plate 47 defines a "locked" (also "clamped") position.
      <br/>
      In the locked position, the work pallet 40 is locked against the planar surface 53 and does not move.
      <br/>
      Once the position of the work pallet 40 has been adjusted, and the locating pins 54 are deployed, the clamping plate 47 is moved to the locked position.
      <br/>
      The clamping plate must be moved back into the receiving position before the work pallet 40 can be readjusted or removed from the work pallet receiver 44.

      FIG. 9 is a schematic diagram illustrating an apparatus 104, 106 for moving the deployable clamping plate 47 upward and downward between the "receiving" and the "locked" positions.
      <br/>
      A vertical activator 104 is connected to the deployable clamping plate 47 via a connector 106.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the combination 104, 106 is provided by a cam and cam follower.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the combination 104, 106 is provided by an eccentric member and an eccentric member retainer.
