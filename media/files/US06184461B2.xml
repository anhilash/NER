    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      In general, the invention relates to a power inlet arrangement.
      <br/>
      In particular, the invention relates to a power inlet arrangement for providing power from a generator to a load center.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Portable generators may be used in certain situations to feed electrical power to residential and commercial load circuits during a utility power outage.
      <br/>
      These systems frequently include a power inlet box which conducts electrical power from the generator to a transfer switching mechanism.
      <br/>
      The transfer switching mechanism continues the electrical path through to selected electrical loads through circuit breakers located at the transfer switch or electrical subpanel.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In the past, the use of a portable generator involved finding or assembling an electrical cord which can be plugged in at one end to the power generator and at the other end to the power inlet box.
      <br/>
      This involves additional time and expense on the part of the installer or user.
      <br/>
      Further, the fact that the cord is separate from the generator makes it possible for the cord to become misplaced or lost, and thus unavailable when needed.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The situation arises where, because of the inconvenience associated with the above mentioned procedure, it is desirable to maintain an electrical cord and its associated power inlet box together.
      <br/>
      When portable generators are used, the need for any additional cords or adaptor fittings would not arise.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      It is an object of the present invention to provide a power inlet arrangement having a permanently affixed cord with a plug for connection to a portable power generator.
      <br/>
      It is a further object of the invention to provide a power inlet arrangement including an enclosure within which a cord is stored when not in use.
      <br/>
      Yet another object of the invention is to provide a power inlet arrangement which is relatively simple in its components and assembly, and which provides significant convenience to the user by ensuring the power inlet cord is always available when needed.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In one aspect of the invention, a power inlet arrangement for use with a portable generator having a power outlet includes a power inlet and a power inlet enclosure which contains the power inlet.
      <br/>
      The power inlet is secured inside the power inlet enclosure, which defines an inner wall and an internal cavity.
      <br/>
      An electrical cord has a first end that is securely attached to the power inlet and a second end having an electrical plug.
      <br/>
      The electrical cord is movable relative to the power inlet between an operating position and a storage position.
      <br/>
      In the operating position, the electrical plug is withdrawn from the power inlet enclosure and engaged with the power outlet of the portable generator.
      <br/>
      In the storage position, the electrical cord is stored within the internal cavity defined by the power inlet enclosure.
      <br/>
      The power inlet is secured adjacent to the inner wall of the power inlet enclosure.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The power inlet enclosure includes a door which is movable between an open position and a closed position.
      <br/>
      The open position of the door provides access to the electrical cord within the internal cavity defined by the enclosure, and the closed position of the door maintains the electrical cord within the power inlet enclosure when the electrical cord is in its storage position.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the power inlet enclosure includes a series of walls defining the internal cavity within which the electrical cord is received when in its storage position, and the door is hingedly mounted to one of the walls for movement between its open and closed positions.
      <br/>
      A peripheral resilient seal may be disposed between the door and the walls of the power inlet enclosure when the door is in its closed position for providing a weathertight seal therebetween.
      <br/>
      The power inlet enclosure may include a notch for receiving the electrical cord when in its operating position for enabling the door to be moved to its closed position.
      <br/>
      The door also may include a second notch for receiving the electrical cord when in its operating position and when the door is in its closed position.
      <br/>
      The power inlet enclosure further includes a latching arrangement for securing the door and selectively preventing access to the interior of the power inlet enclosure when the door is in its closed position.
      <br/>
      The door provides selective access to the internal cavity when in its open position for enabling a user to move the cord between its operating and storage positions and for providing selective access to the power inlet.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In another aspect of the invention, a flexible cord defines a first end fixed to a power inlet and electrically connected to an electrical, panel, and a second end which has a plug that is engageable with the generator power outlet.
      <br/>
      The power inlet is remote from the electrical panel, and an enclosure is associated with the power inlet and the plug of the flexible cord can be withdrawn from the enclosure to selectively engage the generator power outlet.
      <br/>
      The enclosure includes a door and a securing mechanism for selectively securing the door to the enclosure and preventing access to the interior of the enclosure.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the first end of the cord is interconnected with the power inlet via a member threadedly engageable with an extension member of the power inlet for fixedly mounting the first end of the cord to the power inlet and providing an electrical connection therebetween.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the power inlet is at least partially defined by the enclosure.
    </p>
    <p num="9">The present invention also contemplates a method of providing an electrical cord usable with the portable generator, generally in accordance with the aforementioned aspects of the invention.</p>
    <p num="10">Various other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be made apparent from the following detailed description and the drawings.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 1 shows a prior art power inlet arrangement for interconnecting a portable generator 10 with a main electrical panel or load center 12 located in the interior of a building 14.
      <br/>
      In the prior art power inlet arrangement of FIG. 1, a manual power transfer panel 16 is mounted adjacent main panel 12, and is interconnected therewith via a series of wires enclosed by a conduit 18 extending between main panel 12 and transfer panel 16.
      <br/>
      Transfer panel 16 may illustratively be a panel such as that manufactured by Reliance Time Controls, Inc. of Racine, Wis. under the designation GEN/TRAN (e.g. model 20216 or any other satisfactory model).
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      A power inlet box 20 is mounted to the wall of building 14, shown at 22.
      <br/>
      Power inlet box 20 includes an external housing including a series of walls such as 24, and a receptacle 26 mounted to a front wall of the housing.
      <br/>
      A cover 28 is mounted to the front wall of the housing via hinge structure, and is movable between an open position as shown in FIG. 1 and a closed position in which cover 28 encloses receptacle 26 when not in use.
      <br/>
      At conduit 30 extends between inlet box 20 and a junction box 32, and a flexible cord 38 is attached at one end to junction box 32.
      <br/>
      At its opposite end, flexible cord 38 has a plug 42 engageable with a power inlet receptacle provided on transfer panel 16.
      <br/>
      Appropriate wiring and connections are contained within inlet box 20, conduit 30 and junction box 32 for providing an electrical path between inlet box 20 and transfer panel 16 when cord 38 is engaged with the inlet receptacle of transfer panel 16.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A power cord 44 extends between generator 10 and power inlet box 20.
      <br/>
      Cord 44 includes a plug 46 at one end, which is engageable with the power outlet of generator 10.
      <br/>
      Cord 44 further includes a connector 48 at the end opposite plug 46.
      <br/>
      Connector 48 is engageable with recessed power inlet 26, for transferring power generated by generator 10 to power inlet box 20, which is then supplied through the wiring in conduit 30, junction box 32, cord 38 and plug 42 to transfer panel 16, and from transfer panel 16 through the wiring in conduit 18 to main panel 12.
      <br/>
      In this manner, generator 10 functions to provide power to selected circuits of main panel 12 during a power outage period.
      <br/>
      Cord 44, which connects generator 10 to power inlet box 20, is often a custom-made cord in which plug 46 and connector 48 are specially selected according to the configuration of the generator power outlet and power inlet 26, respectively.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, it is possible to construct a cord such as 44 utilizing conventional power cords together with specialized adaptor fittings.
      <br/>
      Either way, it can be difficult to provide such a cord having correct fittings for both the outlet of generator 10 and power inlet 26 of power inlet box 20.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, cord 44 is separate from both generator 10 and power inlet box 20, which gives rise to problems in properly storing cord 44 when not in use so as to ensure cord 44 is not lost or misplaced.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 2 illustrates a power inlet arrangement 49 of the invention for providing power from generator 10 to main electrical panel 12.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the prior art power inlet box 20 of FIG. 1 is replaced with a power inlet enclosure, shown generally at 50, mounted to building wall 22.
      <br/>
      Conduit 30, junction box 32 and cord 38 are of the same construction and configuration as illustrated in FIG. 1, for transferring power from power inlet enclosure 50 to transfer panel 16 in the same manner as is known in the prior art.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, power inlet enclosure 50 includes a box having a pair of side walls 52, 54, and top and bottom end walls 56, 58, respectively.
      <br/>
