      <br/>
      The other end of the lock core assembly 14 is mounted in a lock core hole 41 in the cover plate 4.
      <br/>
      Thus, the lock core assembly 14 is positioned.
      <br/>
      The base plate 1 further includes an opening 15 through which an end of a press member 16 extends.
      <br/>
      The base plate 1 provides a support for pivotal movement of the press member 16 about a pin 17.
      <br/>
      Two ends of the pin 17 are pivotally, respectively received in two pin-receiving holes 18 located on both sides of the opening 15.
      <br/>
      The base plate 1 further includes a pair of protrusions 19 for keeping rectilinear movement of a press-plate 35.
    </p>
    <p num="16">

      The transmission assembly 3 includes the-above mentioned transmission wheel 31, an actuating plate 32, a control plate 33, a follower disc 34, the above-mentioned press-plate 35, and a locking bar 36.
      <br/>
      The transmission wheel 31 is mounted in the axle hole 23 of the bottom plate 2 and includes teeth 311 that mesh with a rack portion 321 of the actuating plate 32, thereby providing transmission therebetween.
      <br/>
      The transmission wheel 31 includes a non-circular hole 312 through which a spindle 62 of the latch transmission wheel 31 is rotated when the spindle 62 is turned.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The actuating plate 32 is mounted between the bottom plate 2 and the base plate 1 and includes knurls 322 that are in contact with the bottom plate 2 for reducing friction between the bottom plate 2 and the actuating plate 32.
      <br/>
      The actuating plate 32 includes a slot 323 through which a block 331 of the control plate 33 extends.
      <br/>
      The slot 323 includes a narrower section (not labeled) and a wider section (not labeled) such that the block 331 is engaged in the narrower section when the control plate 33 is turned, thereby providing firm engagement to allow transmission between the control plate 33 and the actuating plate 32.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The control plate 33 includes a slot 332 for receiving a cam 341 of the follower disc 34.
      <br/>
      When the follower disc 34 is turned, the control plate 33 is turned via transmission of the cam 341 and a projection 333 of the control plate 33 is moved into or out of a groove 351 of the press-plate 35.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The cam 341 of the follower disc 34 is eccentrically arranged for bearing against a side wall defining a portion of the slot 332 of the control plate 33, thereby turning the control plate 33.
      <br/>
      In order to restrain rotational movement of the follower disc 34, the follower disc 34 includes a flange 343 of a non-circular shape or having symmetric opposite straight sides.
      <br/>
      An elastic member 37 is attached to the reduced diameter portions of the non-circular shape or flat symmetric opposite straight sides of the flange 343.
      <br/>
      Thus, the follower disc 34 is rotatable and can be stopped at a predetermined position.
      <br/>
      The elastic member 37 is mounted to an inner side of an annular ledge 131 formed in the lock core assembly hole 13.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The press-plate 35 is mounted between the protrusions 19 of the base plate 1 and biased by elastic elements 352 downward to a predetermined position.
      <br/>
      The above-mentioned groove 351 of press-plate 35 releasably receives the projection 333 of the control plate 33.
      <br/>
      The press-plate 35 further includes a hole 353 through which the end of the press member 16 extends.
      <br/>
      When the press member 16 is pressed, the press-plate 35 is moved upward.
      <br/>
      If the projection 333 of the control plate 33 is engaged in the groove 351 of the press-plate 35, the control plate 33 is moved upward.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The locking bar 36 has a non-circular section and includes an end for engaging with the lock core (not labeled) of the lock core assembly 14.
      <br/>
      The other end of the locking bar 36 is connected to a turn-button 51 of the inner handle 5.
      <br/>
      The follower disc 34 is mounted around the locking bar 36 such that the locking bar 36 is turned to thereby turn the follower disc 34 for providing a locking function when either the lock core of the lock core assembly 14 or the turn-button 51 is turned.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The cover plate 4 is mounted to an outer side of the base plate 1 to provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance.
      <br/>
      The cover plate 4 is engaged with the outer handle 43 to allow easy pivotal movement of the door 7.
      <br/>
      The other end of the lock core assembly 14 is mounted in the lock core hole 41 in the cover plate 4 through which a key (not shown) is insertable.
      <br/>
      The cover plate 4 further includes an opening 42 beyond which the other end of the press member 16 extends for manual operation.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIGS. 2 and 3 show the locked status of the lock which can be obtained by means of turning the turn-button 51 or operating a key for the lock core of the lock core assembly 14.
      <br/>
      The locking bar 36 is turned to rotate the follower disc 34.
      <br/>
      The cam 341 of the follower disc 34 urges the control plate 33 to turn to thereby make the projection 333 of the control plate 33 disengage from the groove 351 of the press-plate 35.
      <br/>
      As a result, when the press member 16 outside the door 7 is pressed, the press-plate 35 is moved upward (FIG. 4), yet the control plate 33 cannot be moved upward, since the projection 333 of the control plate 33 is disengaged from the groove 351 of the press-plate 35.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the pressing of the press member 16 is a virtual work.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIGS. 5 and 6 show the lock in an unlocked status that can be obtained by means of turning the turn-button 51 or operating a key for the lock core of the lock core assembly 14.
      <br/>
      The locking bar 36 is turned to rotate the follower disc 34.
      <br/>
      The cam 341 of the follower disc 34 urges the control plate 33 to turn to thereby make the projection 333 of the control plate 33 engage with the groove 351 of the press-plate 35.
      <br/>
      As a result, when the press member 16 outside the door 7 is pressed (FIG. 7), the press-plate 35 is moved upward, and the control plate 33 is also moved upward, since the projection 333 of the control plate 33 is engaged with the groove 351 of the press-plate 35.
      <br/>
      Thus, the actuating plate 33 is moved upward via transmission of the block 331 of the control plate 33.
      <br/>
      The transmission wheel 31 is turned via transmission of the rack portion 321 of the actuating plate 32 and the teeth 311 of the transmission wheel 31.
      <br/>
      The spindle 62 is turned, as it is engaged in the non-circular hole 312 of the transmission wheel 31.
      <br/>
      As a result, the latch bolt 61 of the latch assembly 6 is retracted, thereby allowing opening of the door 7.
    </p>
    <p num="26">FIG. 8 illustrates application of the lock in accordance with the present invention to a thicker door.</p>
    <p num="27">Accordingly, the big-handle lock in accordance with the present invention provides a locking function, which is convenient to installation and use.</p>
    <p num="28">
      Although the invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiment as mentioned above, it is to be understood that many other possible modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      It is, therefore, contemplated that the appended claims will cover such modifications and variations that fall within the true scope of the invention.
