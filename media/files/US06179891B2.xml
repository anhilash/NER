      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a filter arrangement and a method for its manufacture.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">Filter arrangements are known in the art, wherein the housing is made up of separately manufactured side plates, which are assembled and then glued to create a tight-fitting bond.</p>
    <p num="5">Filter housings of this type are unsatisfactory from the standpoint of production engineering and of economy.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">The present invention is based on the object of providing a filter arrangement which can be manufactured quickly, simply, and cost effectively.</p>
    <p num="7">
      To achieve the object of the present invention, the filter housing in manufactured of one deep-drawn molded piece.
      <br/>
      The housing is preferably made of a polymeric material.
      <br/>
      Manufacturing a housing from a polymeric material can be carried out particularly simply and cost-effectively, compared to a housing made of four side plates which are assembled and then glued to each other in order to produce a tight-fitting bond.
    </p>
    <p num="8">A housing made of a polymeric material can, for example, also be used in areas of high humidity without the material of the housing rusting or becoming soft, as in prior art housings.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The filter arrangement of the present invention can surround an accordion fold pack with a housing.
      <br/>
      The accordion fold pack, on the peripheral side, is entirely encircled by a seal at least once along its entire height.
      <br/>
      The accordion fold pack, which may be elastically prestressed, is arranged in the housing, sealingly but non-adhesively.
      <br/>
      In this way, the filter unit is capable of pre-assembly, is made up of the accordion fold pack surrounded by the seal, and can be installed into the housing significantly more quickly.
      <br/>
      The filter arrangement of the present invention can be manufactured simply and cost-effectively.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      According to an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, provision can be made that, for the accordion fold pack, the housing has at least one limit stop projecting to the inside of the housing on the outlet side of the housing.
      <br/>
      In this way, installing the accordion fold pack surrounded by the seal into the housing is further simplified, and assembly defects are minimized.
      <br/>
      For installing the filter unit, which can be pre-assembled and is made up of the accordion fold pack and the seal, into the housing, the filter unit is inserted from the inlet side until the outlet-side edge of the filter unit contacts the adjacent limit stop of the housing.
      <br/>
      The accordion fold pack and the housing are then optimally positioned with respect to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The seal is preferably made of a nonwoven fabric, and the accordion fold pack of a glass fiber paper.
      <br/>
      Depending on the particular circumstances of the application in which the filter is being used, the seal and the accordion fold pack can be made of the same nonwoven fabric.
      <br/>
      In this regard, it is advantageous if the seal and the accordion fold pack, after their use, can be disposed of and/or reused together.
    </p>
    <p num="12">The accordion fold pack and the seal are preferably adhesively joined, for example, by being glued to each other.</p>
    <p num="13">On the other hand, however, the possibility exists that the seal is designed to be ring-shaped, closed upon itself, and encircling the accordion fold pack, in a pre-stressed, sealing and non-adhesive manner.</p>
    <p num="14">The specific embodiment described above is nevertheless the preferred one, because positioning an accordion fold pack and seal relative to each other during installation in the housing is thus avoided, so that assembly is made easier.</p>
    <p num="15">
      One advantage of the filter arrangement of the present invention is that the accordion fold pack, as a result of the non-adhesive fastening, can be removed from the housing without difficulty, so that, after use, it be able to be replaced by a new accordion fold pack, which is surrounded by a seal.
      <br/>
      The housing can thus be reused as often as desired.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The filter arrangement of the present invention is manufactured such that a plate made of a polymeric material is deep-drawn to produce a housing having essentially a pot-shaped or cup-shaped cross section, and then the base, with the exception of the limit stop, is punched out, the exterior periphery of the accordion fold pack being completely encircled by the seal at least once, and the encircled accordion fold pack being pressed into the housing down to the limit stop.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The accordion fold pack and the seal are preferably glued to each other.
      <br/>
      In this way, it is ensured that the unit, which can be pre-assembled and is made up of the accordion fold pack and the seal, can be installed easily.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">
      In FIGS. 1 to 3, an exemplary embodiment of a filter arrangement according to the present invention is depicted.
      <br/>
      The filter arrangement contains a filter unit, which can be pre-assembled and is made up of an accordion fold pack 4 surrounded by a seal 3 on the peripheral side along its entire height.
      <br/>
      This filter unit, which may be preassembled, has in its uninserted condition with regard to the insertion space in housing 1, an overdimension--i.e., is larger than the space into which it is to be inserted.
      <br/>
      As a result, accordion fold pack 4 is therefore arranged in an elastically pre-stressed manner in housing 1, sealingly (as a result of seal 3) but non-adhesively.
      <br/>
      Sealing created by seal 3 between accordion fold pack 4 and housing 1 comes about exclusively as a result of an elastic pressure compaction of seal 3.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1, accordion fold pack 4 is made of a glass fiber paper and seal 3 of a nonwoven fabric.
      <br/>
      Accordion fold pack 4 and seal 3 are preferably glued to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      From FIG. 1 it can be seen that housing 1 has an essentially pot-shaped or cup-shaped cross section.
      <br/>
      Housing 1 is made of a deep-drawn polymeric material.
      <br/>
      The base 6 of housing 1 is formed only of a limit stop 5, which, in housing 1, protrudes toward the inside of housing 1 at the outlet side of the filter unit.
      <br/>
      The remainder of base 6, on the inner side of limit stop 5, is punched out of the polymeric material.
      <br/>
      A goal in manufacturing housing 1 is that limit stops 5 have the smallest possible dimensions in the direction of accordion fold pack 4, in order not to restrict the outlet cross section more than necessary and impede flow through the filter unit.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Accordion fold pack 4 is surrounded on its peripheral side along its entire height 2 by the seal 3, in order to prevent a short circuit or side diversion of the flow through the accordion fold pack 4, between the inlet and outlet sides of accordion fold pack 4.</p>
    <p num="23">
      FIG. 2 shows a top view of the inlet side of the accordion fold pack 4.
      <br/>
      It can be seen that seal 3, made of nonwoven fabric, entirely surrounds accordion fold pack 4 on the peripheral side and is elastically pre-stressed and sealingly contacts the inner side of housing 1, facing accordion fold pack 4, on all sides.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 3 shows a view from below of accordion fold pack 4 according to FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      It can be seen that limit stop 5 is designed in the shape of an aperture and extends along the entire periphery of housing 1.
      <br/>
      Limit stop 5 extends in the direction toward the inside, the dimension of limit stop 5 being larger than the thickness of seal 3.
      <br/>
      In this way, it is assured that not only seal 3 but also at least one fold of accordion fold pack 4 contacts limit stop 5.
      <br/>
      Thus an exact positioning of accordion fold pack 4 with regard to housing 1 is ensured.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 4 depicts housing 1 in perspective.
      <br/>
      Housing 1 is manufactured from a sheet of polymeric material which is deep-drawn, and it is therefore designed in one piece.
      <br/>
      When the deep-drawing process is completed, base 6 inside limit stop 5 is punched out.
