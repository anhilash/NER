    <p num="1">This application claims the priority of German patent application No. 198 10 665.3, filed Mar. 12, 1998, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a Bowden cable for transmitting tensile forces which is composed of an exterior flexible Bowden cable casing and of an interior pulling element guided in sections in the Bowden cable casing.
      <br/>
      At least one end of the Bowden cable casing is fastened to a receiving device of a stationary holding member in the longitudinal direction.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In an arrangement with Bowden cables for transmitting tensile forces used, for example, in connection with the interior door operating system of the Porsche Boxster, a metal sleeve provided with a radially projecting collar is pressed onto and fastened to an end of the Bowden cable casing or sleeve and the collar is fitted in sections into a corresponding slot of a receiving device arranged on a support part of the interior door operating system.
      <br/>
      Adjacent to the slot, two spaced snap tongues are molded to the support part, and the Bowden cable casing can be pressed into the snap tongues by displacing movement transversely to the longitudinal direction of the Bowden cable casing.
      <br/>
      Relatively high manual force expenditures are required for snapping-in the Bowden cable casing.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, this Bowden cable arrangement does not assure that the end of the Bowden cable will remain in the fastening position.
    </p>
    <p num="4">It is one object of the invention to further develop an end-side fastening of a Bowden cable casing on a stationary holding member such that simple and fast mounting and demounting of the Bowden cable casing on the receiving device are ensured with low force expenditures and without requiring an auxiliary tool, and so that the Bowden cable casing is securely held in the fastening position.</p>
    <p num="5">
      According to the invention, this object is achieved by providing an injection-molded-on end piece on the end of the Bowden cable casing to be fastened.
      <br/>
      The end piece can be pushed into a receiving device of the holding member which extends approximately parallel to the longitudinal direction of the Bowden cable casing.
      <br/>
      The end piece is fixed in the receiving device, in the axial direction, by at least one resilient supporting arm constructed on the end piece.
      <br/>
      Additional characteristics and advantageous developments of the invention are also reflected in the claims.

      The principal advantages achieved by the invention are that an end piece, injection-molded onto the end of the Bowden cable casing to be fastened, can be connected with the receiving device in a simple manner by way of a plug-in connection aligned in the longitudinal direction of the Bowden cable casing, and that, in the completely pushed-in fastening position, an additional axial fixing with respect to detachment takes place by molded-on supporting arms.
      <br/>
      The supporting arms can be swivelled into a release position for demounting the connection.
      <br/>
      The injection-molded-on end piece and the corresponding receiving device can be produced in a simple manner and at a reasonable cost.
      <br/>
      As soon as the guide grooves at the end piece contact the holding webs of the receiving device, the Bowden cable casing, when the operating handle is swivelled, is automatically pulled into the fastening position (a secure end position).

      <br/>
      In the fully pushed-in fastening position B, the end piece 13 is fixed in the axial direction by at least one elastic supporting arm 15 supported on the receiving device 14.
      <br/>
      The end piece 13 is injection-molded on the outside to the free end of the Bowden cable casing 2.
      <br/>
      However, the end piece 13 may also be formed by a separate injection-molded plastic part which is connected with the Bowden cable casing 2 by gluing or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      According to FIG. 2, the end piece 13 comprises a prismatic basic body 16 which receives the Bowden cable casing 2 approximately in the center and which, on the face side 17 facing the hook 7, has a short projecting hollow connection piece 18 through which the pulling element 3 is guided.
      <br/>
      A profiled foot section 20, which extends in the longitudinal direction of the Bowden cable casing 2, extends away from a bottom wall 19 of the basic body 16.
      <br/>
      The foot section 20, in the illustrated embodiment, has an approximately T-shaped profile.
      <br/>
      The T-shaped foot section 20 and the spaced bottom wall 19 form two opposite guide grooves 21 with approximately U-shaped profiles.
      <br/>
      The flange of the T-shaped foot section 20, which extends in parallel to the bottom wall 19, projects slightly beyond the face side 17 with its end situated in the slide-in direction and has an inserting slope 23.
      <br/>
      The holding member 5 is constructed in the embodiment in one piece with the support part 12 of the interior door operating system 6, in which case the receiving device 14 provided at the holding member 5 comprises two spaced holding webs 24 onto which the guide grooves 21 of the end piece 13 can be pushed.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The holding webs 24 are constructed in one piece with a plane wall section 25 of the support part 12.
      <br/>
      A recess 26 is provided between the spaced holding webs 24, the clear opening of the recess 26 being slightly larger than the thickness of the connection web 27 of the T-shaped outer section 20 to be guided through.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The longitudinal dimensions of the holding webs 24 and the guide grooves 21 are approximately the same.
      <br/>
      The guide grooves 21 extend along the whole length of the prismatic basic body 16.
      <br/>
      An approximately rectangular insertion opening 28 is disposed in front of the two holding webs 24, through which insertion opening 28 the foot section 20 of the prismatic body 16 can be inserted into the receiving device 14 and guide grooves 21 can be pushed onto the holding webs 24 (see inserting position E).
      <br/>
      The receiving device 14 also comprises two spaced transverse webs 29, 30 which are aligned approximately at a right angle with respect to the wall section 25.
      <br/>
      Each transverse web 29, 30 has an approximately central slot opening 31, 32 which is open on one side.
      <br/>
      The Bowden pull casing 2 or the connection piece 18 is guided through the slot openings 31, 32.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The transverse web 29 which is situated closer to the swivel arm 8 adjoins the forward end of the two holding webs 24, whereas the other, more rearward transverse web 30 coincides with the rearward end of the insertion opening 28.
      <br/>
      For axially securing the end piece 13 in the fastening position B, preferably two spaced resilient supporting arms 15 are constructed on the end piece 13.
      <br/>
      In the fastening position B, the arms are supported by inwardly directed detent noses 33 in a form-locking manner on the interior side of the transverse webs 30.
      <br/>
      The two supporting arms 15 are guided away on both longitudinal sides 34 of the prismatic basic body 16 from short transversely extending webs 35 and extend parallel to the longitudinal direction of the Bowden cable casing 2.
      <br/>
      Each supporting arm 15 comprises a first elongated arm section 36 which projects beyond the basic body 16 in the longitudinal direction and on which locally inwardly directed detent noses 33 are constructed.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The first arm section 36 is connected in one piece with a second short arm section 37 which extends in parallel and at a slight distance with respect to the longitudinal side 34 of the prismatic basic body 16.
      <br/>
      By the admission of pressure to the inside onto the two short arm sections 37, the first arm sections 36 are swivelled from an operative position F to the outside into a release position G.
