      This application is a division of U.S. application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/994,220, filed Dec. 19, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,902,909.
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to new compounds which are useful as intermediates for the production of fluorescent whitening agents and to a process for their production.</p>
    <p num="3">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 2,465,486, a process is described for the production of 4,4'-divinyl-biphenyl.
      <br/>
      This process comprises dehydrating 4,4'-di-( ALPHA -hydroxyethyl)-biphenyl in the presence of a dehydrating agent.
      <br/>
      The reaction is preferably conducted in an atmosphere of inert gas, at reduced pressure and at elevated temperature.
      <br/>
      The gaseous 4,4'-divinyl-biphenyl so obtained is chilled to convert it to the solid state.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A further known process for the production of 4,4'-divinyl-biphenyl is that described in JP 08003079.
      <br/>
      In this process, 4,4'-diethyl-biphenyl is contacted with a dehydrogenation catalyst in the presence of steam; a cooling medium is rapidly added to the gaseous reaction product containing 4,4'-divinyl-biphenyl; and a solution or dispersion containing the 4,4'-divinyl-biphenyl is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The compound 4,4'-divinyl-biphenyl is known for use as a starting material for the production of copolymers with other monomers such as styrene.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to use 4,4'-divinyl-biphenyl as a starting material for certain fluorescent whitening agents.
      <br/>
      Thus, 4,4'-divinyl-biphenyl may be reacted, in the presence of a palladium compound, according to the Heck reaction, with diazo compounds to form distyryl-diaryl fluorescent whitening agents.
      <br/>
      If so used in the Heck reaction, however, there would be obtained only the corresponding symmetrical distyryl-diaryl fluorescent whitening agents.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The present invention provides, as a first aspect, a new class of vinyl-biphenyl compounds which are useful for the production of asymmetrical or symmetrical distyryl-diaryl fluorescent whitening agents.</p>
    <p num="7">Accordingly, the present invention provides compounds having the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="8">
      in which R is hydrogen or C1 -C4 alkyl, preferably hydrogen, and Y is hydrogen, C1 -C4 alkyl, C1 -C4 alkoxy, CF3, halogen (F, Cl, Br or I) or SO3 M in which M is hydrogen, Na, K, Ca, Mg, ammonium, mono-, di-, tri- or tetra-C1 -C4 alkylammonium, mono-, di- or tri-hydroxyalkylammonium or ammonium that is di- or tri-substituted with a mixture of C1 -C4 alkyl and C1 -C4 hydroxyalkyl groups.
      <br/>
      Preferably Y is hydrogen.

    <p num="9">The preferred compound of formula (1) is 4-vinyl-4'- ALPHA -hydroxyethyl-biphenyl.</p>

    <p num="12">
      The solvent used is preferably a polyalkylene glycol or a di-alkyl ether thereof, preferably a polyethylene glycol or a dimethyl ether thereof, especially diethylene glycol or triethylene glycol-dimethyl ether.
      <br/>
      If an acid-free solvent such as triethylene glycol-dimethyl ether is used, then a minor amount of an acidic compound such as p-toluene sulfonic acid is preferably present during the partial dehydation process according to the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The partial dehydation process according to the second aspect of the invention is preferably conducted at normal pressure and in the presence of a effective amount of a compound which is an inhibitor of the polymerisation of styrene monomers.
      <br/>
      Examples of such polymerisation inhibitors include quinones, hindered phenols and amines.
      <br/>
      The preferred polymerisation inhibitor is tert.-butylpyrocatechol.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      At dehydration temperatures above 200 (degree)  C., the product of formula (1) begins to dehydrate to form 4,4'-divinyl-biphenyl.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the reaction temperature used in the partial dehydation process according to the invention is preferably held in the range of from 180 (degree)  to 220 (degree)  C. and the content of the reaction mixture is monitored, and the reaction is stopped as soon as the optimal amount of the product of formula (2) is detected in the reaction mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In addition to the partial dehydration process according to the present invention for the production of a compound of formula (1), other possible routes are available for obtaining a compound of formula (1).
      <br/>
      The various routes are summarised in the following scheme:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)

    <p num="26">Step b) of the process, the dehydration of the compound of formula (5) to the compound of formula (6), is conveniently conducted according to the dehydration procedure described in relation to the process for the production of a compound of formula (3), comprising dehydrating a compound having the formula(1).</p>
    <p num="27">
      The reaction of a compound having the formula (1) with a diazonium compound having the formula R1 --N2 X THETA , and the reaction of a compound having the formula (6) with a diazonium compound having the formula R2 --N2 X THETA , viz. steps a) and c) of the process, are each conducted under the conditions of the Heck reaction, namely in the presence of a palladium compound, as catalyst.
      <br/>
      The reaction is conducted in an organic solvent such as water, an aliphatic alcohol or an aliphatic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Examples of palladium compound catalysts include inorganic palladium salts such as the chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, sulfate, acetate or propionate, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      The palladium compound may also be used in the form of a complex.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable complex formers include alkyl nitriles, such as C1 -C4 alkylnitriles, aryl nitriles such as benzonitrile, phosphites such as triphenyl phosphite, triaryl phosphanes such as triphenyl phosphane or the mono-, di- or tri-sodium salt thereof, bis(diarylphosphane)-alkanes such as bis(diarylphosphane)-methane, -ethane, -propane or -butane, trihetarylphosphanes such as trifurylphosphane and bis(dibenzalacetone).
      <br/>
      The organic complex formers may be substituted with one or more water-solubilising groups such as sulfo groups or carboxyl groups.
      <br/>
      The preferred palladium compound catalyst is palladium�bis(dibenzalacetone)�2.

    <p num="29">If the Heck reactions are effected in water, as solvent, preferably the palladium compound catalyst used contains one or more water-solubilising groups such as sulfo groups or carboxyl groups.</p>
    <p num="30">
      Preferably, however, the reaction steps a) and c) are conducted in an organic solvent, especially in a C1 -C12 alcohol or in a C1 -C4 alkanoic acid.
      <br/>
      Examples of such C1 -C12 alcohols include methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, t-butyl alcohol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol, n-octanol, n-decanol and n-dodecanol.

      The reaction temperature in steps a) and c) preferably ranges from 0 (degree)  to 100 (degree)  C., especially from 10 (degree)  to 80 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="32">After completion of step a) or c), the palladium catalyst is preferably recovered for re-use, by methods which are well-known.</p>
    <p num="33">The diazonium compounds having the formula R1 --N2 X THETA  or R2 --N2 X THETA  in which R1, R2 and X THETA  have their previous significance, used as respective reactants in steps a) and c), are known compounds and may be produced by methods known per se.</p>
    <p num="34">
      For example, the said diazonium compounds may be produced by reacting the corresponding amines of formula R1 --NH2 or R2 --NH2 with an alkali metal nitrite or with an alkyl nitrite in the presence an acid in aqueous or in organic solution.
      <br/>
      If the diazotisation is conducted in organic solution, it is preferred that the water, produced as a by-product of the diazotisation reaction, is removed as it is formed.
      <br/>
      The removal of such water may be conveniently conducted by effecting the diazotisation in the presence of water-binding materials such as acetic anhydride, sodium sulfate, calcium chloride or molecular sieves.
