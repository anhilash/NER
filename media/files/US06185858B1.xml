      A leader attachment tool for use securing a wire leader within a fishing rig that includes a bent wire member including a handle portion, a right angle offset portion, an axis portion, a connecting hook with a tapered insertion end, an attachment eyelet, and a plastic sleeve handle.
      <br/>
      The leader attachment method includes the steps of 1) providing an embodiment of the leader attachment tool; 2) inserting the free end of a length of wire leader through the eye of a fishing item to be secured in a fishing rig; 3) tying the free and the connected end of the wire leader into an overhand knot about the eye of the fishing item; 4) pinching the free end of the leader material against the connected end of the leader material between the user's thumb and forefinger; 5) inserting the tapered insertion end of the connecting hook of the leader attachment tool through the eye of the fishing item; and 6) rotating the handle portion to spin the eye of the fishing item while continuing to pinch the free end of the leader material against the connected end of the leader material between the user's thumb and forefinger to tightly wind the free end of the leader material about the connected end of the leader material.

    <heading>EXEMPLARY MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      FIG. 1 shows an exemplary embodiment of the leader attachment tool of the present invention, generally designated 10.
      <br/>
      Leader attachment tool 10 includes a bent wire member, generally designated 12, and a tubular plastic sleeve handle 14.
      <br/>
      Bent wire member 12 is of bent, stainless steel rod construction and includes an attachment eyelet 16, a handle portion 18, a right angle offset portion 20, an axis portion 22, and a connecting hook 24 with a tapered insertion end 26.
      <br/>
      Attachment eyelet 16 has an eyelet opening 18 that is sized to fit over the end of a nail of other rod shaped support for supporting attachment tool 10 when it is not needed.
      <br/>
      Handle portion 18 is straight, of a length "A" of three and one-half inches (31/2") and terminates at a far end 30 in attachment eyelet 16 and at a near end 32 in a right angled integral connection with one end 34 of right angle offset portion 20.
      <br/>
      Right angled offset portion 20 is straight, of a length "B" of two inches (2") and terminates at another end 38 in a right angled integral connection with a rear end 40 of axis portion 22.
      <br/>
      Axis portion 22 is straight, oriented in parallel with handle portion 18, of a length "C" of three and one-half inches (31/2") and has a front end 42 that terminates in an integral connection with connecting hook 24.
      <br/>
      Connecting hook 24 is semi-circular shaped and has a diameter "D" of one-half inch (1/2").
      <br/>
      Plastic sleeve handle 14 is a two and one-half inch (21/2") length of rigid plastic tubing that is rotatably trapped on handle portion 18 between attachment eyelet 16 and right angle offset portion 20.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      An exemplary method of attaching a wire leader to a fish hook is now described.
      <br/>
      The first step of the exemplary leader attachment method is 1) providing a leader attachment tool 10 as described herein above.
      <br/>
      With reference to FIG. 2, the second step is 2) providing a length or wire leader material, generally designated 50 to be used to attach a fishing item, such as a fish hook, generally designated 52.
      <br/>
      The third step 3) is to insert the free end 54 of wire leader 50 through the eye 56 of fishing item 52.
      <br/>
      With reference to FIG. 3, the fourth step is 4) tying the free end 54 and a connected end 58 of wire leader 50 into a conventional overhand knot about eye 56 of fishing item 56.
      <br/>
      With reference now to FIG. 4, the fifth step is 5) pinching free end 54 of leader 50 against connected end 58 of leader 50 between the user's thumb 60 and forefinger 62 and then inserting tapered insertion end 26 of connecting hook 24 of leader attachment tool through eye 56 of fishing item 52.
      <br/>
      With reference to FIG. 5, the sixth step is 6) rotating handle portion 18 to spin eye 56 of fishing item 52 while continuing to pinch free end of leader 50 against connected end of leader 50 between the user's thumb 60 and forefinger 62 to form windings 70 formed from free end 54 about connected end 58.
      <br/>
      It can be seen from the preceding description that in a first aspect of the invention a leader attachment tool for use securing a wire leader within a fishing rig has been provided that includes a bent wire member including a handle portion, a right angle offset portion, an axis portion, a connecting hook with a tapered insertion end, an attachment eyelet, and a plastic sleeve handle; the handle portion terminating at a far end in the attachment eyelet and at a near end in a right angled integral connection with one end of the right angle offset portion; the right angled offset portion terminating at another end in a right angled integral connection with the rear end of the axis portion; the front end of the axis portion terminating in an integral connection with the connecting hook; the plastic sleeve handle being rotatably positioned over the handle portion of the bent wire member; the handle portion and the axis portion being oriented in parallel with each other; and in a second aspect of the invention a leader attachment method has been provided that is easily learned; that results in a tightly wound connection between the wire fishing leader and the eye of a fishing item such as a fish hook swivel, lure, etc.; and that includes the steps of 1) providing a leader attachment tool including a bent wire member including a handle portion, a right angle offset portion, an axis portion, a connecting hook with a tapered insertion end, an attachment eyelet, and a plastic sleeve handle; the handle portion terminating at a far end in the attachment eyelet and at a near end in a right angled integral connection with one end of the right angle offset portion; the right angled offset portion terminating at another end in a right angled integral connection with the rear end of the axis portion; the front end of the axis portion terminating in an integral connection with the connecting hook; the plastic sleeve handle being rotatably positioned over the handle portion of the bent wire member; the handle portion and the axis portion being oriented in parallel with each other; 2) inserting the free end of a length of wire leader through the eye of a fishing item to be secured in a fishing rig; 3) tying the free and the connected end of the wire leader into an overhand knot about the eye of the fishing item; 4) pinching the free end of the leader material against the connected end of the leader material between the user's thumb and forefinger; 5) inserting the tapered insertion end of the connecting hook of the leader attachment tool through the eye of the fishing item; and 6) rotating the handle portion to spin the eye of the fishing item while continuing to pinch the free end of the leader material against the connected end of the leader material between the user's thumb and forefinger to tightly wind the free end of the leader material about the connected end of the leader material.
