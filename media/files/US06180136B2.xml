    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      It is known that water insoluble drugs can be rendered injectable by formulating them into aqueous suspensions of phospholipid-coated microcrystals.
      <br/>
      Haynes, U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,188 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,187, disclosed a method of coating pharmaceutical compounds with a phospholipid layer that makes water insoluble drugs able to be contained within an aqueous medium, and therefore suitable for injection in a mammal.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Baurain et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,973,467 describes the preparation of microcrystals of ginkolide B, kadsurenone, amphotericin B, and nystatin.
      <br/>
      Baurain et al. prepared microcrystals by the common method of forming a lipid film in a flask by dissolving the lipids to he used in organic solvent, evaporating the solvent, and then sonicating in the presence of the active compound to produce miciocrystals sized between 0.1  MU m and 2  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Animal husbandry operations which manage large numbers of animals have been unable to realize the benefits of the prior technology because it has not been successfully applied on a large scale.
      <br/>
      The procedures disclosed by Haynes and others have had limited commercial practicability since the methods involve the use of sonication or other processes which are inappropriate or impractical for producing commercially advantageous quantities of product.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The present invention provides a method suitable for economically producing yields of up to thousands of liters of pharmaceutical compositions for the sustained release of a pharmacologically active compound.
      <br/>
      The method can be applied with a commercial scale homogenizer, or any instrument or technique which provides the necessary forces to effectively coat the pharmacologically active compound with the lipid suspension.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Furthermore, the compositions of the prior art have relied on commonly available forms of phospholipid mixtures which are highly purified and prohibitively expensive for use on a commercial scale.
      <br/>
      The present invention discloses a method for isolating a composition of lipids from egg yolk which results in a suspension of lipids which can be economically produced, and can be used to coat a pharmacologically active compound to produce the microcrystals of the present invention.
      <br/>
      These microcrystals exhibit several beneficial characteristics, including a longer sustained release time and the ability to sharply decrease the toxicity of drug compounds.
      <br/>
      These microcrystals may be formed into an injectable suspension for subcutaneous injection into a mammal.
      <br/>
      The suspension may be syringeable and therefore suitable for subcutaneous injection.
    </p>
    <p num="6">One skilled in the art will realize that the microcrystals of this invention can be administered to the mammal in a variety of other ways including, but not limited to, skin patches, ocular inserts, shooting through the skin at high velocity with a medical "air gun," suppositories, or simply providing the compounds in a mammal's food and water.</p>
    <p num="7">
      It has been previously thought that it is desirable to produce a composition of microcrystals having homogeneous microcrystals of a very small size.
      <br/>
      Previously, it has been believed that it is desirable to produce microcrystals below 1  MU m, or at least below 2  MU m or 3  MU m. The present invention discloses that unexpected benefits, including benefits in timed release delivery, can be realized by producing a composition which contains microcrystals of varying sizes.
      <br/>
      The present invention discloses compositions wherein at least 50 percent of the microcrytals are from about 0.5  MU m to about 3.0  MU m in diameter, at least ten percent of the microcrystals are from about 3.0  MU m to about 10  MU m in diameter, and the compositions contain microcrystals which are greater than about 10  MU m in diameter.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, at least about 50 percent of the microcrystals will be from about 0.5  MU m to about 3  MU m in diameter, from about thirty to about forty percent of the microcrystals will be from about 3  MU m to about 10  MU m in diameter, and the composition contains microcrystals which are greater than about 10  MU m in diameter.
      <br/>
      We have found that by utilizing microcrystals of these varying sizes sustained release times of as long as 10-12 days can be obtained.
      <br/>
      The person of skill in the art will readily realize that even presently known lipid compositions may be put into the novel compositions claimed herein to realize these benefits.
      <br/>
      The invention teaches novel compositions which are mixtures of microcrystals of varying sizes as disclosed herein.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention also di closes methods for treating infections in mammals.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, methods are provided for treating respiratory diseases in mammals, in particular, infections of the respiratory tract.
      <br/>
      In particularly preferred embodiments, methods are provided for treating bovine respiratory disease (commonly known as "shipping fever"), kennel cough in dogs, and Potomac fever in horses.
      <br/>
      In another particularly preferred embodiment, methods are provided for treating infections of the respiratory tract in cats.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Prior methods of treating infections in animals have centered on the regular and repeated administration of antibiotics to the mammal until the infection was eradicated, sometimes by incorporating the drug into the animal's food or water, by oral administration in a paste or with a balling gun, or by repeated injections.
      <br/>
      Therapeutic regimens often failed due to a failure on the part of the animal owner to follow the prescribed regimen.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides a method of treating infections which requires only a single administration of the microcrystal compositions of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The microcrystal composition may be an injectable syringeable suspension.
      <br/>
      The administration can be delivered by an animal care professional and does not require further participation by the owner for a successful result of the therapy, thereby eliminating issues of therapy noncompliance by the owner as a reason for failure of the therapy.
      <br/>
      The present methods are applicable to a variety of mammals including, but not limited to, bovines, equines, porcines, caninee, and felines.
      <br/>
      The person of skill in the art will readily realize that the methods herein disclosed will find applicability to a wide variety of mammals.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The person of skill in the art will also readily realize that the compositions and techniques described herein can be applied to a wide variety of pharmacologically active compounds.
      <br/>
      Various antibiotics, anesthetics, anti-inflammatory agents, and anti-protozoan agents may all be incorporated into a microcrystal suspension, as may other chemical compounds of varied uses which will be apparent to those of skill in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      We have also observed that pharmacologically active compounds which are coated with the phospholipid composition of the present invention are able to attach to blood cells.
      <br/>
      In this case the pharmacologically active compound is found associated with the blood cells in blood analysis assays.
      <br/>
      This characteristic of the microcrystals of the present invention serves to facilitate the delivery of pharmacologically active compound to the body tissues.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="36">
      The present invention relates to a new technology for the manufacture of sustained release pharmaceutical compositions, particularly as applied to water insoluble drugs in a veterinary context.
      <br/>
      The compositions may be provided as suspensions in an injectable syringeable form.
      <br/>
      The invention provides for the manufacture of microcrystals which contain from about 10 percent to about 30 percent (w/v) of an antibiotic or other pharmacologically active compound as the active ingredient, and from about 15 percent to about 30 percent (w/v) of phospholipids syrup as dispersing agent.
      <br/>
      The suspension products may be terminally sterilized by gamma radiation.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment the suspension may contain microcrystals which contain from about 25 percent to about 30 percent (w/v) of a pharmacologically active compound (OTC), and about 20 percent (w/v) phospholipids syrup.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the pharmacologically active compound is oxytetracycline (OTC). (We have found that this higher percentage of OTC results in a more concentrated depot of medication which has resulted in a longer release time for the drug into the blood of the treated animal.
      <br/>
      We have also found that the higher concentration of OTC enables the use of a smaller volume of pharmaceutical suspension, thus decreasing stress on the animal.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The antibiotic-containing suspensions are sustained release formulations which are effective fox the treatment of various diseases.
      <br/>
      There are provided methods for the manufacture of suspensions containing microcrystal which contain numerous antibiotics, including tilmicosin, cephalone, ofloxacin, cefazolin, cefuroxine and its derivatives, cefoperazone, cefaclor, sarafloxicin, NTZ, and ciprofloxicin.
      <br/>
      Other methods are provided for the manufacture of microcrystals which contain anti-inflammatory agents such as flunixin, anesthetics such as propofal, and anti-protozoan agents such as nitazoxanide.
      <br/>
      The suspensions may be provided in a syringeable injectable form.
      <br/>
      The dose may be calculated on a per pound basis.
      <br/>
      The suspension dose may be administered subcutaneously per injection for the required number of injections in different skin regions per treatment.
      <br/>
      In cows, more than one injection may be required, whereas in other mammals such as dogs, cats, or pigs a single injection of the antibiotic may be effective to achieve the therapeutic objective.
      <br/>
      The injection(s) can provide therapeutic tissue levels of pharmacologically active compound over periods of up to 10-12 days.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Water insoluble drugs may be tendered injectable by formulating as aqueous suspensions of phospholipid-coated antibiotic microcrystals for veterinary subcutaneous administration.
      <br/>
      The membrane phospholipid stabilizes the microcrystals by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      We have also unexpectedly found that the microcrystals of the present invention offer the additional advantage of sharply reducing the toxicity of certain pharmacologically active compounds, rendering these compounds safe to use.
      <br/>
      For example, there has been a great hesitancy to use drugs such as tilmicosin and flunixin because of their known toxic effects.
      <br/>
      Similar concerns surround the use of oxytetracycline in horses and cows.
      <br/>
      We have unexpectedly found that tilmicosin and flunixin can be safely injected into cats, dogs, and pigs when they are coated with the phospholipid compositions of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Oxytetracycline can also be rendered much safer for horses and cows when coated with these compositions.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the present invention makes available to the animal caretaker drug products which were formerly underutilized die to concerns over animal safety.
      <br/>
      The present invention also provides a new tool to animal caretakers dealing with resistant strains of organisms since previously underutilized antibiotics can be used with greater confidence.
    </p>
    <p num="40">Effects of Utilizing a Range of Microcrystal Sizes</p>
    <p num="41">
      An important aspect of the present invention is the fact that homogenization at high pressure of solid particles of pharmacologically active compounds such as antibiotics or other drugs, with a lipid suspension produces a thorough and complete coating of the solid particles with the lipid suspension.
      <br/>
      We have unexpectedly found that if the homogenization processing is stopped at a point where the microcrystals exist in a range of particle sizes, a suspension can be produced which offers the benefit of longer release times when injected into mammals.
      <br/>
      It was previously believed that it was desirable to produce microcrystals in the size range of 0.1  MU m to 3  MU m, with a preference for microcrystals below 1  MU m in diameter.
      <br/>
      However, we have unexpectedly found that longer release times can be obtained by stopping the homogenization process at a point when more than at least about 50 percent of the microcrystals are from about 0.5  MU m to about 3.0  MU m in diameter, at least about ten percent of the microcrystals are from about 3  MU m to about 10  MU m in diameter, and at least about 90% of the microcrystals produced are less than about 10  MU m in diameter.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, at least about 50 percent of the microcrystals are from about 0.5  MU m to about 3  MU m in diameter, from about 3.0 percent to about 40 percent of the microcrystals are from about 3.0  MU m to about 10  MU m in diameter, and the suspension contains microcrystals which are greater than about 10  MU m in diameter.
      <br/>
      In a particularly preferred embodiment, at least about one percent of the microcrystals are greater than about 10  MU m in diameter.
      <br/>
      We have unexpectedly found that the release times of diffusion from an injection "depot" into the blood to the infection site by the pharmacologically active compounds contained by the microcrystals can be increased by obtaining suspensions which contain microcrystals of these varying sizes.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      While not wanting to be bound by any particular theory or principle, it is also believed that the unique lipid composition disclosed herein may play an important role in realizing the sustained release times we have obtained.
      <br/>
      It is also thought that it may be a combination of the unique particle sizes and the novel lipid compositions of the present invention which combine to enable the realization of these benefits.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Longer Treatment Intervals</p>
    <p num="44">
      The longer sustained release times which have been attainable with the compositions and methods of the present invention result in important advantages.
      <br/>
      We have achieved sustained release times of 10-12 days in cattle and 7 days in dogs, cats, and swine.
      <br/>
      Dogs and cats can be treated with a single administration thus eliminating issues of therapy noncompliance by owners, a major reason for failure of a therapeutic regimen.
      <br/>
      Cattle can be treated once every 10-12 days as opposed to presently available methods and compounds which require treatment at intervals of about 3-5 days.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the present invention offers the additional benefit of cost savings to the animal owners and substantially decreased stress on the animals, which are treated at less frequent intervals, or a single time.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Therefore, using the compositions and methods disclosed herein, we have been able to realize the useful benefits of microcrystal technology, and have shown the efficacy of these novel pharmaceutical products and obtained release times longer than any others thus far available.
      <br/>
      Since homogenization can be conveniently practiced on a large scale using industrial-sized homogenizers, this invention makes available methods of producing microcrystals of useful pharmacologically active compounds on a large, commercially viable scale where up to thousands of liters of material can be conveniently and economically produced.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In the manufacturing process, the temperature of the suspension increases during homogenization.
      <br/>
      We have found that the consistency of the suspension is not acceptable at a processing temperature greater than 60 (degree)  C., and preferably should be processed below 50 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the suspension contains microcrystals of oxytetracycline.
      <br/>
      This suspension is very useful for the treatment of bovine respiratory disease.
      <br/>
      The person of skill in the art will realize that the principles and techniques disclosed herein can be applied to a variety of compounds in many contexts.
      <br/>
      Even water soluble compounds can be chemically modified so as to behave more like water insoluble compounds.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished by a change in pH or by covalent modification of the molecule or by complexation with various molecules which are used in the art to decrease the water soluble properties of a molecule.
      <br/>
      The person of ordinary skill will realize that the principles and techniques described herein will also find application to some Water soluble compounds which have been modified so as to chemically behave more like water insoluble compounds, and will know of various methods which are available to modify water soluble compounds to make them chemically behave more like water insoluble compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="48">The Homogenizer</p>
    <p num="49">
      We have achieved success in manufacturing the microcrystals of the present invention with a homogenizer from APV Gaulin Rannie, Wilmington, Massachusetts, Model MS18-10TBS, which was operated according to the manufactufer's instructions.
      <br/>
      We were unable to achieve the desired level of coating of microcrystals with homogenizers of other manufacturers which operate according to a principle of agitation with a probe with blades and stirring.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      While not wanting to be bound by a single theory or operating principle, it is believed that the properties of the homogenizer which are needed to successfully conduct the method are that the suspension is forced through a very small aperture under pressure, as opposed to those homogenizers which work according to a "chop and blend" principle.
      <br/>
      It is believed that the shear forces generated by the pressures involved combined with the forcing of the crystalline particles through the small aperture facilitates the coating of the crystalline form of the pharmacologically active compound with the composition of phospholipid syrup.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the process is conducted with pressures of above 10,000 psi which reduces the size of the microcrystals.
      <br/>
      In embodiments where the suspension will be injected into the mammal, it is important that the homogenizer produce a material which is flowable, lacks clumps, and contains microcrystals in the size ranges disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      As we have stated, in a preferred embodiment, the homogenizer produces microcrystals which are of a variety of sizes, at least about 90% of which are less than about 10  MU m in diameter.
      <br/>
      More than about 50 percent of the microcrystals will be from about 0.5  MU m to about 3  MU m in diameter, and the composition will contain microcrystals greater than about 10  MU m in diameter.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, a substantial portion, usually from about 30 percent to about 40 percent will be from about 3  MU m to about 10  MU m in diameter.
      <br/>
      In another particularly preferred embodiment, approximately 1-2%, will be greater than about 10  MU m in diameter.
      <br/>
      This range of sizes is very beneficial for obtaining longer sustained release times than have been previously available.
      <br/>
      As the homogenizer forces the material through the apertures and breaks up any clumps which are present, it also coats the solid particles with the lipid composition.
      <br/>
      Any homogenizer which operates according to the same principles as the Gaulin Homogenizer should produce microcrystals which can be effectively used to practice the present inventions.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      A person of skill in the art will realize that other instruments operating under a variety of principles may be used to produce the microcrystals described herein, as long as they produce a suspension which is flowable, lacks clumping, thoroughly coats the microcrystals with the lipid composition, and are able to produce microcrystals of the sizes described herein.
      <br/>
      Useful, though not optimal microcrystals may also be obtained by utilizing the novel lipid composition described above with microcrystals described in the prior art.
      <br/>
      However, the benefit of being able to economically produce microcrystal suspensions on a commercially viable scale will be realized, as well as sustained release times which may be realized with the novel lipid composition disclosed herein.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Other benefits are also obtainable with the compositions and methods of the present invention.
      <br/>
      We have found that microcrystals of the present invention are able to be taken up by or attach to blood cells.
      <br/>
      While not wanting to be limited or bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the phospholipid compositions of the present invention enables the crystalline drug compounds to be taken up by or associated with blood cells by either being recognized by the blood cell as a compound to be taken into the cell, by associating with or becoming embedded within the cell membrane, or by van der Waals forces.
      <br/>
      It may be that the microcrystals become associated with the blood cells by a combination of these factors, or by other, presently unknown factors.
      <br/>
      However, the microcrystals of the present invention are associated with blood cells in blood analysis assays.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The invention is further illustrated through the following examples.
      <br/>
      These examples are not intended to be limiting.
      <br/>
      The person of skill in the art will realize that these techniques can be applied to a variety of compounds in various contexts.
    </p>
    <p num="54">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="55">
      The lipid composition of the present invention contains a particular mix of phospholipids.
      <br/>
      We have found that increased sustained release times may be obtained by using this phospholipid composition.
      <br/>
      The phospholipid composition of the present invention can be derived from egg lecithin.
      <br/>
      The composition contains phosphatidylcholine and a substantial amount of phosphatidylethanolamine.
      <br/>
      It also contains other lipids such as steroids, di- and tri- glycerides, and other fatty acids.
      <br/>
      The present method allows for the extraction of a lipid mixture which is useful for practicing the present invention at a cost which is substantially less than those previously available.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      To extract the phospholipid mixture which may be employed in the present invention, we performed a lipid extraction procedure which began with dehydrated yolk from chicken eggs.
      <br/>
      The yolk material was extracted once with acetone, followed by one extraction with ethyl alcohol.
      <br/>
      The solvents were removed and the remaining syrup was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy.
      <br/>
      Of the syrup obtained, 90% was found to be solids.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Approximately 70% of the phoslholipid syrup material was lipid.
      <br/>
      At least 50% of the lipids were phosphatidylcholine and at least 15% was phosphatidylethanolamine.
      <br/>
      The remainder were other lipids.
      <br/>
      While these are typical compositions, more or less of these materials may be present.
      <br/>
      For example, we found that phosphatidylcholine sometimes comprised up to 68% of the lipid material, and phosphatidylethanolamine can comprise as little as 10% or 15% or as much as 25% of the lipid material.
      <br/>
      The actual amounts may vary depending on a variety of factors which are normal and expected in chemical processes, such as the technique of the operator.

      <br/>
      Mannitol USP was added and the ingredients mixed until the mannitol dissolved.
      <br/>
      WFI was then added to 45% of final tank batch volume, and the solution mixed for at least 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      Mannitol was tested for and whenever necessary, increments of mannitol or WFI were added to achieve a final mannitol concentration of 2.25% (w/v).
      <br/>
      Suspension recirculation was then initiated (20).

      <br/>
      WFI was added to the target final batch volume and mixed for at least 15 minutes.
      <br/>
      We note that the mannitol and paraben were first mixed with WFI using less than the total expected amount of water.
      <br/>
      We then added the phospholipids syrup which went readily into solution.
      <br/>
      The OTC powder was then blended into this liquid.

      FIG. 2 shows the mean serum and lung tissue concentrations of OTC as a function of time.

      Group average body weights on the day of drug treatment were between 587-632 lbs.

      While oxytetracycline is commonly used to treat Potomac fever in horses, the administration of OTC in horses presents the danger of killing the animal if the drug is administered too quickly, as OTC may interact with and lyse the white blood cells and cause severe shock in the animal.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there exists a need for a safer mode of administering medications of this type to horses and other mammals.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      25% OTC microcrystals were injected subcutaneously and intra-muscularly into healthy horse.
      <br/>
      This was found to cause temporary sore muscles in the horses, but no other adverse effects were observed.
      <br/>
      Therapeutic levels of OTC will be observed for up to 10 days.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      25% OTC microcrystals were also administered intravenously into horses at a dose of 14 mg/lb.
      <br/>
      No adverse effects were observed with this mode of administration, and statistical extrapolation revealed therapeutic levels of OTC will remain in the blood for at least five days.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      25% OTC microcrystals were also administered intravenously at a dose of 16 mg/lb.
      <br/>
      No adverse effects were observed, and this dose will provide therapeutic levels of OTC for over five days.
    </p>
    <p num="82">While not wanting to be bound by any particular theory or principle, it is believed that the lipid coating of the microcrystal composition serves to form a protective barrier and protect the labile white blood cells from the OTC.</p>
