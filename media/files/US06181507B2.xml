      <br/>
      A method and system for reducing positioning noise in a data storage system are provided.
      <br/>
      An access device is positioned over a data storage medium using a stream of bursts stored on the medium.
      <br/>
      The bursts are sensed at a frequency determined by the rate at which the medium is moved relative to a sensing device.
      <br/>
      Output positioning values are provided to position the access device at a frequency higher than the frequency at which the positioning bursts are sensed, and/or at random times.
      <br/>
      The random times may be calculated as random advances or delays from time points occurring at a fixed frequency.

      <br/>
      No. 60/007,989, entitled "Randomized Oversampling Servo Algorithm for Low Seek Acoustics," filed Dec. 5, 1995. The Provisional Application is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
    </p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to data storage systems.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to a method and system for reducing the noise encountered when providing positioning values to an access device to position the access device over a data storage medium.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Conventional sector servo direct access storage devices ("DASDs") have a fixed number of servo sectors (N) with the disks spinning at a fixed rotation speed (w revolutions per second).
      <br/>
      The sampling rate (or frequency) fS corresponds to N*w samples per second.
      <br/>
      The servo bursts in the servo sectors are referred to herein as a stream of positioning bursts, and the bursts of this stream are therefore sensed by a sensing device at the rate at which they move past the sensing device, or fS.
      <br/>
      Digital servo controller designs are usually implemented assuming this sampling rate.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Seek acoustic noise generated by a DASD mechanism is a significant problem.
      <br/>
      The acoustic noise generated during seek arises from broadband forcing of the environmental components or from the excitation of "pure tone" modes at a well defined frequency fS.
      <br/>
      It is critical to minimize seek acoustics without compromising the access performance of a DASD.
      <br/>
      Pure tone modes due to structural resonance can get amplified through the servo feedback process or due to roughness (significant step change) in the digital-to-analog converter ("DAC") output value.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The configuration of a typical DASD servo is shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      An exemplary DASD 10 is depicted having a sensing device (actuator 14 coupled to read/write electronics 12).
      <br/>
      It should be understood to those skilled in the art that the terms "sensing device" and "access device" used herein should be construed broadly and without limitation to connote parts of the same subsystem within the DASD, or components of different subsystems.
      <br/>
      An access device (actuator 14, voice coil motor ("VCM") 15, and spindle/VCM Driver 22) is also depicted.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A position error signal ("PES") 32 (derived from a sensed position burst via line 30) from peak detecting demodulator 16 is initially sampled by an analog-to-digital converter 26 within a microprocessor unit ("MPU") 18 and sent to the hard disk controller ("HDC") 20 for PES non-linearity processing 24, where known distortion of the PES is first corrected (by the HDC without burdening the MPU).
      <br/>
      The linearized PES is sent back to the MPU for conventional seek servo computation in Seek/Settle/Tk-Follow subsystem 28.
      <br/>
      During seek, a velocity servo technique is used to produce an output positioning control value (referred to herein simply as a positioning value) denoted by Un where n is the sampling instant.
      <br/>
      For every sector denoted by n-1, n, n+1 . . . etc., a new control output or positioning value is computed (possibly provided by a DAC, and typically with some time delay) and sent to the access device via line 34.
      <br/>
      The positioning values 34 are therefore calculated as a function of the sensed positioning (servo) bursts stored on the storage medium.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      What is required is a method and system which reduce the noise associated with the fixed frequency sampling rates of conventional servo systems, such as the one depicted in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The servo computation complexity should be minimized to maintain the use of low cost MPUs in DASD designs.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The shortcomings of the conventional approaches are overcome by the present invention which, in one aspect, is a method and system for positioning an access device used to access data on a data storage medium.
      <br/>

    <p num="15">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</p>
    <p num="16">
      Conventional seek servo systems update the DAC value at a sampling rate corresponding to the servo-sector rate fS, which is determined by the rate at which the data storage medium moves past a sensing device.
      <br/>
      The servo system output, referred to herein as the positioning value, steps up or down by an amount computed by the conventional seek servo technique from Un-1, to Un at sampling instant n. Movement of the medium relative to the sensing device can be accomplished by any relative type of motion between these two components.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The acoustic noise spectrum produced by the substantial DAC output change (Un -Un-1) is reduced and potential for pure tone build up is minimized utilizing the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Output roughness and pure tone potential are reduced by computing a new low roughness DAC output sequence of length "m" which is then oversampled, possibly randomly, at a rate of "mfS " samples per second.
      <br/>
      The additional positioning values generated by the oversampling are referred to herein as intermediate positioning values.
      <br/>
      Un is referred to herein as the desired positioning value, and Un-1 is referred to herein as the present positioning value, with respect to PESn.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The simplest output sequence corresponds to the linearly interpolated value(s) between Un and Un-1.
      <br/>
      The resultant finely graduate DAC output sequence reshapes the acoustic spectrum in a desirable direction without compromising the seek performance.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As depicted in FIG. 2, the output curve of a stream of positioning values 50 generated by a conventional seek servo undergoes a series of step changes for every sector n-2, n-1, n, n+1, etc.
      <br/>
      Logically, the higher the DAC step (i.e., the difference between the amplitudes of Un and Un-1) the larger the undesired acoustic response of the DASD actuator system will be.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As shown in FIG. 3a, and in accordance with the present invention, output amplitude change is minimized, for example, by incrementing the value only by 50% of the original magnitude change but in two steps based on the doubling of the output sampling rate (i.e., m=2).
      <br/>
      In general, the desired amplitude jump can be achieved in m steps within a sector time and the output is oversampled at a general frequency of mfS.
      <br/>
      The conventional output waveform 50 is shown with the overlayed, inventive output waveform 60 in FIG. 3a.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Simplicity of the technique is achieved by maintaining the proven, low complexity control scheme in the MPU intact, and by adding a post operation in the HDC which is simply a division by an integer number of the control step value (e.g., a simple shift operation).
      <br/>
      No measurable change in access time is expected by the oversampling operation.
      <br/>
      However, if warranted, some weighting factors can be used to scale the oversampled sequence, so that the time-integral of the control effort is kept identical to the conventional case at each PES sampling instant.
      <br/>
      In a generalized case, the oversampled sequence does not have to be equally spaced, and an optimum time interval between each sequence can be implemented specifically for any given DASD hardware structural dynamics.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The fixed interval oversampling reduces the spectral energy in the frequency range where the actuator components could be mechanically responsive.
      <br/>
      However, fixed interval oversampling does not eliminate the possibility of pure tone generation.
      <br/>
      A pure tone is generated when the forcing frequency and structural resonance are matched because of a fixed time interval DAC output that has a strong phase correlation with pure tone mechanics.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Therefore, in another embodiment of the present invention, the output timing of the stream of generated positioning values is randomized.
      <br/>
      In other words, rather than generating positioning values at fixed frequencies fS or mfS, the output timing is randomized (e.g., as random advances or delays around the otherwise fixed time points occurring at fS or mfS).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      By randomizing the DAC output timing, as shown by the output waveform 70 in FIG. 3b, the possibility of locking into pure tone forcing is minimized.
      <br/>
      Both acoustic generation modes (output roughness &amp; pure tone) are minimized by this embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3b, it can be observed that the first DAC output can only be delayed ("D", 72a, 72b, 72c) from the fixed sampling time whereas all other oversampled, intermediate outputs can either be delayed 74c or advanced ("A", 74a, 74b) with respect to the nominal sampling rate because their magnitude is known a priori.
    </p>
    <p num="25">It should be noted that the present invention involves oversampling of output values, randomizing the times at which output values are provided, or a combination of these two techniques.</p>
    <p num="26">
      In FIG. 4a, the technique of oversampling is illustrated in which the system mechanics consist of a resonant mode with frequency equal to that of output sampling frequency (2fS) of the servo.
      <br/>
      A pure tone build-up 82 is induced by the fixed sample rate output waveform 60.
      <br/>
      However, in FIG. 4b, the randomized output sampling rate waveform 70 results in a dissipation of the pure tone, as shown by waveform 84.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The results of a "servo-mechanics" model used to evaluate the roughness minimization oversampling are presented in FIGS. 5a-d. The time domain and spectral plots for conventional (FIGS. 5a-b) and oversampled (m=3) output (FIGS. 5c-d) cases with time domain seek trajectories (102, 112) and actuator currents (100, 110) are shown.
      <br/>
      In this example it can be seen that the improved actuator current spectrum 116 is generally reduced in magnitude from the conventional spectrum 106 in the high frequency range above 1000 Hz.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIG. 6 depicts an exemplary hardware implementation of a 2.5" DASD in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Like reference numerals are used to designate the like elements shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      However, unlike FIG. 1, an improved HDC 200 is provided, within which now resides unit 204 for computing the intermediate positioning values between Un (212) and Un-1 (206).
      <br/>
      In this case, the nominal output sampling was doubled, and thus two positioning values Un1 (216) and Un2 (214) are calculated as a function of a desired positioning value Un (212) and present positioning value Un-1 (206).
      <br/>
      The improved HDC 200 performs the output generation 210 and timing randomization 208 operations, in accordance with specific techniques known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      The MPU 18 simply computes the traditional control output Un for every PESn.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Those skilled in the art will recognize that unit 204 performs the following calculations to produce Un1 and Un2 :</p>
    <p num="30">
      DELTA =Un -Un-1
      <br/>
      J= DELTA /2
      <br/>
      Un1 =Un-1 +J
      <br/>
      Un2 =Un1 +J
    </p>
    <p num="31">"J" as calculated in this example represents one half of the amplitude jump  DELTA  normally encountered in conventional systems.</p>
    <p num="32">
      FIGS. 7a-7d show the actual timing (in time-averaged, raster format) used to generate an output data stream, the spectral characteristics of which are depicted in FIGS. 8-9. In the conventional sampling mode, the interval between two PES samples is 252 us(microseconds) as shown in FIG. 7a. Due to MPU operation and the PES conversion process, there is a minimum delay 300 of 90 us before the first DAC output positioning value appears.
      <br/>
      In addition, there is an unavoidable variance of 15 us (minimum to maximum time) present for the conventional positioning values (302a, 302b) as shown in FIG. 7b.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In the case of fixed frequency oversampling as shown in FIG. 7c, first DAC output 304a still occurs after 90 us from receiving the positioning (servo) burst ready signal.
      <br/>
      The second, intermediate DAC output 306 occurs 126 us following the first DAC output, and has no process induced variance.
      <br/>
      The cycle repeats beginning with output 304b.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      For the combination of randomized oversampling, FIG. 7d depicts the time-averaged intentionally random times at which the positioning values are provided.
      <br/>
      The first DAC output value 308a has 82 us variance and the second intermediate DAC output 310 has 50 us variance.
      <br/>
      Again, the cycle repeats beginning with output value 308b.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      FIG. 8a and FIG. 8b represent a spectral comparison (waveforms 350, 352) of conventional and fixed oversampled voice coil motor (VCM) voltage power spectra corresponding to the waveforms of FIG. 7b and FIG. 7c. It can be seen that the spectrum has been reshaped, and the peak value present at 4 kHz has been eliminated, but a new peak appears at 6 kHz with much lower (12 dB change) peak value.
      <br/>
      A second mode at 8 kHz seems to be unaffected by the oversampling operation.
    </p>
    <p num="36">FIG. 9a and FIG. 9b represent a spectral comparison (waveforms 350, 354) of the conventional and randomized oversampling cases, corresponding to the waveforms of FIG. 7b and FIG. 7d. The power spectrum for this case (354) appears very close to the fixed oversampled case (352) of FIG. 8b, with further reduction in the 6 kHz peak and a slight increase in the 4 kHz peak.</p>
    <p num="37">
      This resultant data confirms that randomized oversampling produces a spectrum comparable to that of fixed oversampling while minimizing the potential for pure tone acoustic generation.
      <br/>
      Randomized output is therefore an effective software solution in the presence of sample rate-based "pure tone" mode when a product hardware design or magnetic sector format could not be changed readily.
