      <br/>
      A photovoltaic device of the present invention has a non-single-crystal semiconductor.
      <br/>
      A layer underlying the non-single-crystal semiconductor has a polycrystalline structure.
      <br/>
      Individual grains of the polycrystal exposed in the surface of the underlying layer have smooth surfaces.
      <br/>
      The surface of the underlying layer has a step along the grain boundaries of the polycrystal, or a protrusion or recess at the grain boundaries.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, polycrystal grains having rough surfaces and polycrystal grains having smooth surfaces commonly exist in the surface of the polycrystalline layer.
      <br/>
      The polycrystalline layer may be a substrate of the photovoltaic device.
      <br/>
      The present invention, by virtue of the use of such a polycrystalline layer, provides a highly reliable and efficient thin-film photovoltaic device which enhances light absorption by the semiconductor layer and which can be produced at a high yield even at a practically adoptable low cost, while eliminating deficiencies of known arts in regard to workability, yield and durability.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a photovoltaic device and, more particularly, to a photovoltaic device which, by virtue of light confinement effect, exhibits improved photoelectric conversion efficiency, as well as improved weather resistance and durability, and which offers a greater yield in the production process.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Various materials of photovoltaic device devices have been known, such as tetrahedral amorphous semiconductors and polycrystalline semiconductors, e.g., amorphous silicon, amorphous silicon germanium and amorphous silicon carbide, II-VI group compound semiconductors, e.g., CdS and Cu2 S, and III-V group compound semiconductors. e.g., GaAs, GaAlAs and so forth.
      <br/>
      Among these known materials, thin-film photovoltaic device devices having photoelectromotive force generating layer made of an amorphous semiconductor or a polycrystalline semiconductor are considered as being promising, because the use of such materials enables formation of a film of greater area than that made of a single-crystal silicon and reduces the required thickness of the film, while permitting deposition on any desired suitable substrate material.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Such a thin-film photovoltaic device, however, cannot provide photoelectric conversion efficiency of a high level which would compare with that of photovoltaic device using single-crystal silicon.
      <br/>
      It is necessary that improvements are achieved both in photoelectric conversion efficiency and durability, in order that this type of photovoltaic device is put to practical use.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Various attempts have been made with an aim to improve photoelectric conversion efficiency of thin-film photovoltaic devices.
      <br/>
      One of the requisites for achieving higher photoelectric conversion efficiency is to enhance absorption of light in the semiconductor layer of the thin film, so as to improve short-circuit current (Jsc).
      <br/>
      Enhancement of the light absorption is necessary because the thinner semiconductor layer which on the one hand meets the requirement for lower production cost and on the other hand reduces the light absorption as compared with devices using bulk semiconductors.
      <br/>
      There are five types of technology available for enhancing light absorption in thin-film semiconductor layer, as shown in (1) to (5) below.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      (1) A technique has been known in which a reflective film having a high level of reflectance, such as of Ag, Al, Cu, Au or the like, is formed on the side of the photovoltaic device element opposite to the light incident side.
      <br/>
      According to this technique, the light which has passed through the carrier-generating semiconductor layer is reflected by the reflective film so as to be further absorbed by the semiconductor layer, so that the light absorption in the thin-film semiconductor layer is enhanced to provide a greater output current, whereby photoelectric conversion efficiency is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      (2) A method has been disclosed in Japanese +Patent Publication Nos. 59-43101 (Applicant: Fuji Electric Co., Ltd.)) and 60-41878 (Applicant: Sharp Corp.) in which the surface nature of a substrate is improved by a transparent conductive layer intervening between a back-side electrode and a semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      According to these disclosures, the transparent conductive layer intervening between the back-side electrode and the semiconductor layer improves the smoothness of the back-side electrode, as well as adhesion of the semiconductor layer, and effectively prevents an alloying reaction between the metal constituting the back-side electrode and the semiconductor layer.
    </p>
    <p num="9">(3) Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 60-84888 (Applicant: Energy Conversion Devices) discloses a technique in which a transparent conductive layer serving as a barrier layer is formed between a back-side electrode and a semiconductor layer, so as to reduce electrical current flowing through the defective region of the semiconductor layer.</p>
    <p num="10">(4) Y. Hamakawa et. al., Appl. Phys. Lett., 43 (1983), p644, reports that a transparent conductive layer of TiO2 interposed between an Ag back-side electrode and an amorphous silicon semiconductor layer serves to enhance sensitivity in longer-wavelength region in the spectral sensitivity of a solar cell.</p>
    <p num="11">
      (5) A technique has been proposed in which the surface of a back-side electrode is textured on the order of the wavelength of the light.
      <br/>
      According to this technique, long-wavelength light rays which have not been absorbed in the semiconductor layer are scattered so as to provide an effect that the light paths in the semiconductor layer are extended to improve the sensitivity of the photovoltaic device at the long-wavelength region.
      <br/>
      Consequently, short-circuit current is enhanced to improve photoelectric conversion efficiency.
      <br/>
      This technique is disclosed in T. Tiedje et. al., Proc. 16th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialist Conf., (1982), p 1423 and also in H. Deckman et. al., Proc. 16th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialist Conf., (1982), p 1425.
    </p>
    <p num="12">With the knowledge concerning these techniques, a photovoltaic device is recommended that has a back-side reflection layer made of a metallic film having a high level of reflectance and which has a light scattering texture of a size on the order of light wavelengths, while serving also as a back-side electrode, and that has a transparent conductive film provided between the back-side reflective film and the semiconductor layer.</p>
    <p num="13">It has been found, however, that practical production of a photovoltaic device having such a back-side electrode encounters the following problems (a) to (d) in regard to workability of the materials and durability of the products.</p>
    <p num="14">
      (a) It has been considered that the texture preferably has pyramidal shapes such as those disclosed in T. Tiedje, et. al., Proc. 16th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialist Conf. (1982), p1423, as such shapes are believed to provide superior light confinement effect.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered, however, that formation of an electrode and a semiconductor layer on the substrate having such a texture tends to cause a leak current through the defect region of the semiconductor layer to increase, thus impairing the yield of production of photovoltaic devices.
      <br/>
      In addition, the semiconductor layer formed on the substrate surface having such pyramidal texture has an effective thickness smaller than that of a semiconductor layer formed on a smooth substrate surface.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the effective thicknesses of layers such as a doping layer in the thin-film photovoltaic device, which are intentionally designed to have smaller thicknesses than those in existing devices, are further reduced, with the result that the open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) are reduced as compared with those of photovoltaic devices formed on a smooth substrate surface.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      (b) The use of Ag or Cu as the material of the metallic back-side reflection layer involves a problem in that migration of Ag or Cu tends to occur, particularly under a positive bias voltage applied to the metallic back-side reflection layer in a highly humid atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Such migration allows electrodes on the light-incident side to conduct, thus causing a shunting of the photovoltaic device.
      <br/>
      It has been confirmed that this phenomenon is remarkable particularly when the metallic back-side reflection layer has a texture on the order of light wavelengths.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      (c) Migration such as that observed with the use of Ag or Cu does not occur when Al is used as the material of the back-side reflection layer.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, the reflectance is lowered when the substrate has a texture.
      <br/>
      In some cases, reflectance was seriously lowered when a transparent conductive layer was superposed on the textured surface of the Al reflection layer.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      (d) Use of a substrate and a back-side reflection layer having smooth surfaces rather than textured surfaces causes insufficient light absorption because the scattering of the light rays at the back side is not appreciable.
      <br/>
      In addition, such smooth surfaces tend to cause insufficient adhesion between the substrate and the back-side reflection layer, undesirably allowing separation of the back-side reflection layer from the substrate in the course of production of the photovoltaic devices.
    </p>
    <p num="18">These problems are serious particularly when the production process employs, for the purpose of low-cost commercial production, inexpensive substrate material such as a resin film, stainless steel or the like, and higher speed of formation of the semiconductor layer, with the result that the yield of the products is undesirably limited.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">Under these circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to provide a thin-film photovoltaic device which exhibits a high degree of reliability and a high level of photoelectric conversion efficiency, as well as enhanced light absorption by the semiconductor layer, and which can be produced at a high yield despite reduced costs of production, thereby overcoming the problems in regard to workability, yield and durability encountered by the prior art.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The inventors have made an intense study in regard to novel structure and production method of a substrate, in order to obtain a photovoltaic device having superior workability and reliability, as well as enhanced light absorption by the semiconductor layer, while eliminating deficiencies in regard to workability and reliability.
      <br/>
      As a result, the inventors have found that the foregoing objects of the present invention can be achieved by a photovoltaic device of the present invention which comprises a substrate having structural features set forth below and/or a polycrystalline thin film layer formed on such a substrate, thus accomplishing the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="21">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a photovoltaic device, comprising: a substrate made of a polycrystalline material;</p>
    <p num="22">and a non-single-crystal semiconductor formed on the substrate; wherein the polycrystal grains exposed on the surface of the substrate have smooth surfaces, and wherein the surface of the substrate has a step along the polycrystal grain boundaries, or a protrusion or a recess at the polycrystalline grain boundaries.</p>
    <p num="23">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a photovoltaic device, comprising: a substrate made of a polycrystalline material; and a non-single-crystal semiconductor formed on the substrate; wherein polycrystal grains having rough surfaces and polycrystalline crystal grains having smooth surfaces exist in the surface of the substrate.</p>
    <p num="24">According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a photovoltaic device comprising: a substrate; and a polycrystalline thin film and a non-single-crystal semiconductor which are formed on the substrate; wherein the surfaces of individual polycrystal grains of the polycrystalline thin film are substantially smooth, and the surface of the polycrystalline thin film has a step along the polycrystal grain boundary, or a protrusion or recess at the grain boundary.</p>
    <p num="25">According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a photovoltaic device comprising: a substrate; and a polycrystalline thin film and a non-single-crystal semiconductor; wherein polycrystal grains having rough surfaces and polycrystal grains having smooth surfaces exist in the surface of the polycrystalline thin film.</p>
    <p num="26">The features set forth above provide the following advantages.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The polycrystalline substrate or the polycrystalline thin film of the present invention exhibits superior adhesion to a thin film formed thereon, as compared with the conventional polycrystalline substrate or a polycrystalline thin film having a smooth surface.
      <br/>
      Therefore, peeling of the thin film from the substrate is avoided in the process of production of photovoltaic device, so that controllability and flexibility of the production process are enhanced.
      <br/>
      At the same time, yield of production of the photovoltaic device is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In addition, it has been confirmed through a weather-resistance acceleration test such as high-temperature high-humidity test and salt spray test that the photovoltaic device of the present invention exhibits superior weather resistance.
      <br/>
      Superior durability also has been confirmed through a scratch test and a mechanical strength test such as a bending test.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The steps or protrusions or recesses at the grain boundaries or partial surface roughness in the polycrystalline substrate or the polycrystalline film surface enhances random reflection at the back side of the photovoltaic device.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the long-wavelength light rays which could not be absorbed in the semiconductor layer can be scattered so as to extend the lengths of light paths in the semiconductor layer, which in turn enhances the short-circuit current (Jsc) of the photovoltaic device so as to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      At the same time, the series resistance of the photovoltaic device is reduced so that the fill factor (FF) is enhanced, thus contributing to improvement in the photoelectric conversion efficiency.
      <br/>
      The reason why the series resistance is reduced has not yet been theoretically clarified.
      <br/>
      It is, however, considered that such a reduction is attributable to the improved adhesion between the thin film and the polycrystalline substrate or between the thin film and the polycrystalline film.
      <br/>
      It is also considered that the reduction of the series resistance owes to removal of impurities from the surface of the polycrystalline substrate or the polycrystalline thin film, because the processing of such a surface is performed physically or chemically, through etching with a gaseous phase or a liquid phase.
      <br/>
      Removal of oxide layer from the surface of the substrate or the polycrystalline thin film also is considered to be one of the reasons of the reduction in the series resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      It has been confirmed also that the photovoltaic device of the present invention exhibits reduced leak current, as compared with the conventional devices having polycrystalline substrates with uniform and regular texture.
      <br/>
      This effect also contributes to an enhancement of the yield.
      <br/>
      In addition, the photovoltaic device of the present invention exhibits greater open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), while maintaining a high value of short-circuit current.
      <br/>
      This also contributes to the improvement in the photoelectric conversion efficiency.
      <br/>
      It is considered that such an advantageous effect is attributed to the following fact.
      <br/>
      The so-called conventional texture structure has a series of a pyramidal or similar shape.
      <br/>
      An attempt to increase the height of the pyramidal shape tends to allow defects of the semiconductor layer to appear in the pyramidal summit.
      <br/>
      In contrast, generation of defects of the semiconductor layer is suppressed in the photovoltaic device of the present invention which is devoid of pyramidal texture.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The semiconductor layer formed on the surface having pyramidal texture has an effective thickness smaller than that of a semiconductor layer formed on a flat surface.
      <br/>
      The effective thicknesses of layers such as a doping layer, which are intentionally designed to have smaller thicknesses than those in existing devices, are further reduced, with the results that the open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) are reduced.
      <br/>
      In contrast, in the photovoltaic device of the present invention, the substrate surface is smooth in a polycrystal grain, except for the grain boundaries.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, rough surfaces are formed only in part of the polycrystal grains, while other polycrystal grains have rather smooth surfaces.
      <br/>
      Therefore, no substantial thinning of the semiconductor layer is caused.
      <br/>
      This is considered one of the reasons why the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor (FF) are increased while a high level of short-circuit current (Jsc) is maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In the conventional devices of the type in which the aforesaid metal having high reflectance is laminated on the substrate surface having so-called texture consisting of pyramidal shapes, or of the type in which the metallic back-side reflection layer of the metal having high reflectance presents a surface with the pyramidal texture structure, the metal of the high reflectance tends to migrate or be diffused into the semiconductor layer, with the result that a shunt of the photovoltaic device is undesirably allowed.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the use of the substrate of the present invention substantially eliminates diffusion or migration of the metal of high reflectance into the semiconductor layer, thus contributing to an improvement in the yield of production of the photovoltaic device, without impairing the high levels of random reflection and short-circuit current (Jsc).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the leak current in the photovoltaic device is reduced, resulting in enhanced open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Aluminum is preferably used as the dominant material of the metallic back-side reflection layer, partly because aluminum is inexpensive and partly because it exhibits smaller tendency of migration than silver and copper.
      <br/>
      Lamination of aluminum on the surface of the substrate having conventional texture structure in the form of pyramidal shapes often results in a reduced total reflection by the surface of the aluminum layer.
      <br/>
      This is so also in the case where the aluminum layer itself has such a texture structure.
      <br/>
      A further reduction in the total reflection is caused when a transparent conductive layer is laminated on the aluminum layer.
      <br/>
      Thus, aluminum could not suitably be used as the material of the back-side reflection layer.
      <br/>
      Lamination of an aluminum layer on a flat substrate surface also is not preferred because of deficiencies such as reduction in the short-circuit current (Jsc) of the photovoltaic device and easy peeling of the aluminum from the substrate.
      <br/>
      In contrast, lamination of aluminum on the substrate of the present invention, with or without a transparent conductive layer formed on the aluminum, does not suffer from the reduction in the total reflection.
      <br/>
      The photovoltaic device of the present invention, therefore, exhibits enhanced light absorption by the semiconductor layer and, accordingly, increased short-circuit current (Jsc), by virtue of the high total reflection presented by the aluminum layer surface.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the adhesion between the substrate and the aluminum, as well as flexibility and controllability of the production process, are increased and, at the same time, yield of production of the photovoltaic device is improved.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the photovoltaic device of the invention exhibits improved weather resistance and durability.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      As stated before, the aluminum layer having the conventional texture structure composed of pyramidal shapes over the entire surface suffers from a reduction in the total reflection.
      <br/>
      The reason why such a reduction in total reflection occurs has not yet been clarified.
      <br/>
      It is, however, assumed that the micro-fine pyramidal structure of a size on the order of light wavelength enhances the surface area of the aluminum, which increases the tendency for a reaction to occur at the interface between the aluminum and the transparent conductive layer, thus allowing a compound to be formed on the interface so as to reduce the reflectance.
      <br/>
      This should be contrasted to the first or second aspect of the present invention which uses a specific substrate and the third or fourth aspect which uses aluminum as the material of the polycrystalline thin film, wherein the increase of the aluminum surface is avoided so that the reaction at the interface between the aluminum and the transparent conductive layer is suppressed, thus offering a remarkable increase in the total reflection.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="37">
      FIGS. 1A to 1D and FIGS. 2A to 2D show, by way of examples, different forms of the photovoltaic device embodying the present invention.
      <br/>
      A detailed description will now be given of the construction of a photovoltaic device of the present invention, as well as to a method of producing the photovoltaic device.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      FIGS. 1A to 1D are sectional views of a photovoltaic device of the present invention, explanatory of the concept of the present invention.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the photovoltaic device shown in these Figures is not intended to limit the scope of the photovoltaic device of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to these Figures, there are shown a substrate 101, a metallic back-side electrode 102, a transparent conductive layer 103, an n-type semiconductor layer 104, an i-type semiconductor layer 105, a p-type semiconductor layer 106, a transparent electrode 107, and a collector electrode 108.
      <br/>
      The structure shown in FIGS. 1A to 1D are of the type in which the incident light enters through the p-type semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      When the photovoltaic device is designed such that the incident light enters through the n-type semiconductor layer, the layer 104 is a p-type semiconductor layer, while the layer 106 is an n-type semiconductor layer.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The photovoltaic device shown in FIGS. 1A to 1D are constructed such that the light is made to be incident from the side opposite to the substrate.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the layers except for the substrate may be laminated in the order reverse to that shown in these Figures, in order to obtain a photovoltaic device of the type in which the light is made to be incident from the same side as the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      FIGS. 2A to 2D show, by way of example, sectional views of a stack-type photovoltaic device explanatory of the concept of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The stack-type photovoltaic device of the present invention shown in these Figures have a lamination of three pin junctions.
      <br/>
      A first pin junction 215, a second pin junction 216 and a third pin junction 217 are stacked in the order as counted from the light incident side.
      <br/>
      The photovoltaic device has a substrate 201 on which are formed a metallic back-side reflection layer 202 and a transparent conductive layer 203 on which the three pin junctions are laminated.
      <br/>
      A transparent electrode 213 and a collecting electrode 214 are formed on the top of the three pin junctions, thus completing the stack-type photovoltaic device.
      <br/>
      Each pin junction is composed of an n-type semiconductor layer 204 (207, 210), an i-type semiconductor layer 205 (208, 211) and a p-type semiconductor layer 206 (209, 212).
      <br/>
      As in the case of the photovoltaic device shown in FIGS. 1A to 1D, the positions of the doping layer and the electrode may be changed depending on the direction of the incident light.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      A detailed description will now be given of each of the layers of the photovoltaic device.
      <br/>
      The layers will be mentioned in the order of formation in the production process.
    </p>
    <p num="42">(Substrate)</p>
    <p num="43">
      The substrate has unique crystalline state and surface nature which provide one of the characteristic features of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The substrate has a polycrystalline structure.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Referring to FIGS. 1A and 2A showing photovoltaic devices in accordance with the first aspect of the invention which use a first form of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Each of the substrates 101, 201 has a surface in which exposed are polycrystalline crystal grains having smooth surfaces.
      <br/>
      The substrate surface has a step along the polycrystal grain boundary, or a protrusion or recess at the polycrystal grain boundary.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The inventors have found that a too small height of the step or protrusion or recess along the polycrystal grain boundary serves to reduce the scattering of light, thus undesirably leading to a reduction in the short-circuit current Jsc, whereas a too large height causes a leak current of the photovoltaic device to increase, resulting in a reduction of the production yield.</p>
    <p num="46">
      The inventors also found that the height or depth of the step along the polycrystal grain boundary or protrusion or recess at the polycrystal grain boundary preferably ranges from 0.01  MU m to 2  MU m, more preferably from 0.02  MU m to 1.5  MU m, and most preferably from 0.03  MU m to 1  MU m. It has also been found that the degree of roughness of the surfaces of the independent polycrystal grains exposed in the substrate surface in terms of Rmax is preferably smaller than the height of the step or the height of protrusion or recess along the polycrystal grain boundary.
      <br/>
      A large Rmax of the crystal grain surface provides a surface nature similar to that of the conventional texture structure, resulting in deficiencies encountered with the conventional texture structure, such as an increase in the leak current, shunting of photovoltaic device, and reduction both in the open circuit voltage Voc and the fill factor FF.
      <br/>
      Thus, the preferred range of the degree of roughness in individual grains vary depending on the height of the step or protrusion or recess along the polycrystal grain boundary.
      <br/>
      The roughness, however, preferably not greater than 2  MU m, more preferably not greater than 1  MU m and most preferably not greater than 0.5  MU m, in terms of Rmax.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      A too small mean grain size of the polycrystal, e.g., below 0.1  MU m, decreases the pitch or spacing of the steps or protrusions or recesses, so that a surface nature becomes similar to that of the conventional texture structure composed of pyramidal shapes, leading to the deficiencies such as increase in the leak current, shunting of the photovoltaic device, and reduction both in the open circuit voltage Voc and the fill factor FF which are encountered with the conventional devices.
      <br/>
      It has been found also that a too large mean grain size of the polycrystal grains, e.g., above 2 mm, decreases the random reflection at the back side of the photovoltaic device, with the result that the short-circuit current Jsc is decreased.
    </p>
    <p num="48">Therefore, the mean grain size of the polycrystal preferably ranges from 0.1  MU m to 2 mm, more preferably from 0.2  MU m to 1 mm and most preferably from 0.5  MU m to 100  MU m.</p>
    <p num="49">
      FIGS. 1B and 2B show photovoltaic devices in accordance with the second aspect of the invention incorporating a second form of the substrate.
      <br/>
      In each of the substrates 101 and 201 shown in these Figures, individual grains of the polycrystal exposed in the substrate surface have different degrees of roughness.
      <br/>
      More specifically, polycrystal grains having grain surfaces with rough surfaces and polycrystal grains having grain surfaces with smooth surfaces are present in the substrate surface.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      A too small difference or variation of the surface roughness between individual polycrystal grains exposed in the substrate surface indicates either that the entire substrate surface is smooth or that the so-called texture structure is developed over the entire surface of the substrate.
      <br/>
      It has been found that, in either of these two cases, the deficiencies of the known art such as a reduction in the light scattering or increase in the leak current in the photovoltaic device becomes notable.
      <br/>
      It has also been discovered that, when the difference or variation in the degree of smoothness between the individual grains of polycrystal exposed in the substrate surface is too large, the nature of the substrate surface resembles that of the conventional texture structure due to presence of polycrystal grains having large roughness, leading to the problems such as shunting in the photovoltaic device, increase in the leak current and reduction both in the open circuit voltage Voc and the fill factor FF.
    </p>
    <p num="51">Therefore, the difference in the degree of surface roughness between the individual polycrystal grains exposed in the substrate surface preferably ranges from 0.01  MU m to 1.5  MU m, more preferably from 0.02  MU m to 1  MU m and most preferably from 0.05  MU m to 0.7  MU m, in terms of the difference in Rmax.</p>
    <p num="52">
      A too small mean grain size of the polycrystal, e.g., below 0.1  MU m, provides either a smooth surface over the entire area of the substrate or the so-called texture structure developed over the entire surface of the substrate, leading to the deficiencies such as increase in the leak current, shunting of the photovoltaic device, and reduction both in the open circuit voltage Voc and the fill factor FF which are encountered with the conventional devices.
      <br/>
      It has been found also that a too large mean grain size of the polycrystal grains, e.g., above 2 mm, decreases the random reflection at the back side of the photovoltaic device, with the result that the short-circuit current Jsc decreases.
    </p>
    <p num="53">Therefore, the mean grain size of the polycrystal preferably ranges from 0.1  MU m to 2 mm, more preferably from 0.2  MU m to 1 mm and most preferably from 0.5  MU m to 100  MU m.</p>
    <p num="54">
      The material of the substrate may be electrically conductive or electrically insulating.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      FIGS. 1C and 2C show photovoltaic devices of the third aspect, in each of which the polycrystalline thin film is used as a metallic back-side reflection layer 102, 202.

    <p num="69">It has been found that a too small height of the step or protrusion or recess along the polycrystal grain boundary serves to reduce the scattering of light, thus undesirably leading to a reduction in the short-circuit current Jsc, whereas a too large height causes a leak current of the photovoltaic device to increase, resulting in a reduction of the production yield.</p>
    <p num="70">
      The inventors found that the height or depth of the step along the polycrystal grain boundary or protrusion or recess at the polycrystal grain boundary preferably ranges from 0.01  MU m to 2  MU m, more preferably from 0.02  MU m to 1.5  MU m, and most preferably from 0.03  MU m to 1  MU m. It has also been found that the degree of roughness of the surfaces of the independent polycrystal grains exposed in the substrate surface in terms of Rmax is preferably smaller than the height of the step or protrusion or recess along the polycrystal grain boundary.
      <br/>
      A large Rmax of the crystal grain surface provides a surface nature similar to that of the conventional texture structure, resulting in deficiencies encountered with the conventional texture structure, such as an increase in the leak current, shunting of photovoltaic device, and reduction both in the open circuit voltage Voc and the fill factor FF.
      <br/>
      Thus, the preferred range of the degree of roughness in individual grains vary depending on the height of the step of protrusion or recess along the polycrystal grain boundary.

      The roughness is, however, preferably not greater than 2  MU m, more preferably not greater than 1  MU m and most preferably not greater than 0.5  MU m, in terms of Rmax.

      It has been found that, in either of these two cases, the deficiencies of the known art such as a reduction in the light scattering or increase in the leak current in the photovoltaic device becomes notable.

      It has also been discovered that, when the difference or variation in the degree of roughness between the individual grains of polycrystal exposed in the surface of the metallic back-side reflection layer is too large, the nature of the surface resembles that of the conventional texture structure due to presence of polycrystal grains having large roughness, leading to the problems such as shunting in the photovoltaic device, increase in the leak current and reduction both in the open circuit voltage Voc and the fill factor FF.

      An excessively small mean grain size of the polycrystal, e.g., below 0.1  MU m, provides either a smooth surface over the entire area of the metallic back-side reflection layer or the so-called texture structure developed over the entire surface of the same, leading to the deficiencies such as increase in the leak current, shunting of the photovoltaic device, and reduction both in the open circuit voltage Voc and the fill factor FF which are encountered with the conventional devices.

      Among these metals are preferably used those having high levels of reflectivity such as aluminum, magnesium, copper, silver and gold.
      <br/>
      When a metal having a high reflectivity is used, the light rays which have not been absorbed in the semiconductor layer are reflected back to the same semiconductor layer at a greater rate, so that the lengths of light paths in the semiconductor layer are extended to enhance absorption of light by the semiconductor layer, thus providing an increased short-circuit current Jsc of the photovoltaic device.

      Consequently, the series resistance of the photovoltaic device is reduced, while the fill factor FF is increased and, at the same time, the short-circuit current is further increased due to enhanced scattering of the light at the interface between the metallic back-side reflection layer and the transparent conductive layer.

      Methods suitable for forming the transparent electrode 107 include evaporation deposition methods such as EB deposition, sputtering deposition or the like, various types of CVD processes, spraying method, spin-on method, dipping method, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      The surface of the transparent electrode 107 may be smooth.

      It is, however, preferred that the surface of the transparent electrode 107 has a certain degree of difference or variation in the smoothness corresponding to the steps, protrusions or recesses along the polycrystal grain boundaries in the substrate or the polycrystalline film.
      <br/>
      Such a nature of the surface of the transparent electrode enhances adhesion between the transparent electrode and the semiconductor layer, so as to increase the degree of freedom of the production process, as well as controllability, which in turn contributes to a further increase in the yield and further improvement in weather resistance and durability.
      <br/>
      In addition, scattering of light is enhanced at the interface between the transparent conductive layer and the semiconductor layer, achieving a further increase in the short-circuit current Jsc.

      The evaluations mentioned above show the fact that CMP-A1-1 photovoltaic device is inferior to EMB-A1 photovoltaic device in yield, adhesion, and photoelectric conversion efficiency following each of the degradation periods.

    <p num="378">It is found that large size ZnO crystal grains and superior total reflectance and irregular reflectance can be obtained if suitable etching conditions are selected (Sample-EMB-A8-21 to 24, 30 to 33, 39 to 42, and 48 to 51).</p>

      For the photovoltaic devices (EMB-A8-1 to EMB-A8-81), 5 sample devices were prepared for each as in Example Al, and each device was further divided into 25 sub-cells.

      The evaluations mentioned above show the fact that the photovoltaic devices other EMB-A8-21 to 24, 30 to 33, 39 to 42, and 48 to 51 are inferior to the mentioned photovoltaic devices in yield and adhesion.
      <br/>
      The substrates in which each crystal grain size was less than 0.1  MU m or the height difference was less than 0.01  MU m were inferior in photoelectric conversion efficiency following each of the degradation periods.
      <br/>
      These facts are attributed to the decrease of FF due to the decrease of the series resistance mainly depending on the adhesion.

      The evaluations mentioned above show the fact that CMP-B5-1 and CMP-B5-3 photovoltaic devices are inferior to EMB-B5 photovoltaic device in yield and adhesion.
      <br/>
      Further, they are also inferior in photoelectric conversion efficiency following each of the degradation periods.
      <br/>
      These facts are attributed to the decrease of FF due to the decrease of the series resistance mainly depending on the adhesion.

      The evaluations mentioned above also show the fact that CMP-B5-2 photovoltaic device is inferior to EMB-B5 photovoltaic device in initial photoelectric conversion efficiency and photoelectric conversion efficiency following each of the degradation periods.
      <br/>
      The inferior initial photoelectric conversion efficiency is attributed to the decrease of a short-circuit current (Jsc) due to the decrease of the total reflectance and the irregular reflectance, while the inferior photoelectric conversion efficiencies after respective degradation periods are mainly attributed to the decrease of the open circuit voltage (Voc).

      In the same manner as in Example C1, photovoltaic devices were fabricated by using an acid solution for etching surfaces thereof and using stainless-steel (SUS430-BA, SUS430-2B, SUS430-2D, and mirror-finished SUS304) plates as the substrate material.
    </p>
    <p num="832">
      A surface of each plate was etched using the acid solution indicated in Table C29 in the same manner as in Example C1.
      <br/>
      A part of each of the substrate after the etching treatment was left as it was for evaluations (Sample-EMB-C8-1 to Sample-EMB-C8-81).
      <br/>
      For other part of the substrate, an AgAl alloy reflection layer was deposited on the surface thereof in the same manner as in Example C1 according to the requirements indicated in Table C29.
      <br/>
      After the AgAl alloy reflection layer was completely deposited, a ZnO transparent electrode layer was deposited on the reflection layer in the same manner as in Example C1 according to the requirements indicated in Table C29.
      <br/>
      A part of the substrate was left as it was for evaluations (Sample-EMB-C8-1 to Sample-EMB-C8-81).
      <br/>
      For other part of the substrate, a pin-type semiconductor layer, an In2 O3 transparent electrode, and a collecting electrode were sequentially formed thereon according to the requirements indicated in Table C29, and thus the fabrication of the photovoltaic devices (EMB-C8-1 to EMB-C8-81) was completed.
    </p>
    <p num="833">For each of Sample-EMB-C8-1 to Sample-EMB-C8-81 which are the substrates prepared by processing in the same manner as in Example C1 until after the completion of the surface treatment, the surface configuration was observed, the crystal grain size, the surface roughness (Rmax), and the schematic surface profile thereof were inspected.</p>
    <p num="834">Table C30 summarizes the results.</p>
    <p num="835">Table C30 shows that the crystal grains size ranges from 0.05  MU m to 3000  MU m and the surface roughness ranges from 0 to 7.0  MU m.</p>
    <p num="836">
      Next, for each of the substrates (Sample-EMB-C8-1 to Sample-EMB-C8-81) which were prepared by processing in the same manner as in Example C1 until after deposition of the transparent conductive layer, the surface configuration was observed, the size of the ZnO crystal grains was checked, and the total reflectance and irregular reflectance were obtained.
      <br/>
      It follows from the resultant data that a crystal grain can grow to a favorable size when the height difference (Rmax) was at least 0.01  MU m. On the other hand, regarding the total reflectance ratio and the irregular reflectance ratio, the height difference (Rmax) of 0.01  MU m or less results in the low irregular reflectance, and the height difference exceeds 2.00  MU m results in the low total reflectance.
    </p>
    <p num="837">It is found that large size ZnO crystal grains and superior total reflectance and irregular reflectance can be obtained if suitable etching conditions are selected (Sample-EMB-C8-21 to 24, 30 to 33, 39 to 42, and 48 to 51).</p>
    <p num="838">
      For the photovoltaic devices (EMB-C8-1 to EMB-C8-81), 5 sample devices were prepared for each as in Example C1, and each device was further divided into 25 sub-cells.

      For each of the photovoltaic devices, the yield was checked, and an adhesion test and respective tests on the optical degradation, the high-humidity/temperature reverse bias (HHRB) degradation, and the temperature/humidity degradation were performed.

    <p num="839">Table C31 to Table C34 summarize the results.</p>
    <p num="840">
      The evaluations mentioned above show the fact that the photovoltaic devices other EMB-C8-21 to 24, 30 to 33, 39 to 42, and 48 to 51 are inferior to the mentioned photovoltaic devices in yield and adhesion.
      <br/>
      The substrates in which each crystal grain size was less than 0.1  MU m or the height difference was less than 0.01  MU m were inferior in photoelectric conversion efficiency following each of the degradation periods.
      <br/>
      These facts are attributed to the decrease of FF due to the decrease of the series resistance mainly depending on the adhesion.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the substrates having a height difference larger than 3000  MU m or a height difference of 3000  MU m are inferior in photoelectric conversion efficiency following each of the degradation periods.
      <br/>
      It is mainly attributed to the decrease of a short-circuit current (Jsc).

      In this example, relationship between a mean size of polycrystalline grains and the Rmax (Difference) of a polycrystalline substrate was evaluated.
      <br/>
      In the same manner as in Example D1, photovoltaic devices were fabricated by using an acid solution for etching surfaces thereof and using stainless-steel (SUS430-BA, SUS430-2B, SUS430-2D, and mirror-finished SUS304) plates as the substrate material.
    </p>
    <p num="1057">
      A surface of each plate was etched using the acid solution indicated in Table D29 in the same manner as in Example D1.
      <br/>
      A part of each of the substrate after the etching treatment was left as it was for evaluations (Sample-EMB-D8-1 to Sample-EMB-D8-81).
      <br/>
      For other part of the substrate, an AgAl alloy reflection layer was deposited on the surface thereof in the same manner as in Example D1 according to the requirements indicated in Table D29.
      <br/>
      After the AgAl alloy reflection layer was completely deposited, a ZnO transparent electrode layer was deposited on the reflection layer in the same manner as in Example D1 according to the requirements indicated in Table D29.
      <br/>
      A part of the substrate was left as it was for evaluations (Sample-EMB-D8-1 to Sample-EMB-D8-81).
      <br/>
      For other part of the substrate, a pin-type semiconductor layer, an In2 O3 transparent electrode, and a collecting electrode were sequentially formed thereon according to the requirements indicated in Table D29, and thus the fabrication of the photovoltaic devices (EMB-D8-1 to EMB-D8-81) was completed.
    </p>
    <p num="1058">For each of Sample-EMB-D8-1 to Sample-EMB-D8-81 which are the substrates prepared by processing in the same manner as in Example D1 until after the completion of the surface treatment, the surface configuration was observed, the crystal grain size, the difference (Rmax (Difference)) in surface roughness (Rmax), and the schematic surface profile thereof were inspected.</p>
    <p num="1059">Table D30 summarizes the results.</p>
    <p num="1060">Table D30 shows that the crystal grains size ranges from 0.05  MU m to 3200  MU m and the Rmax (Difference) ranges from 0 to 8.2  MU m.</p>
    <p num="1061">
      Next, for each of the substrates (Sample-EMB-D8-1 TO Sample-EMB-D8-81) which were prepared by processing in the same manner as in Example D1 until after deposition of the transparent conductive layer, the surface configuration was observed, the size of the ZnO crystal grains was checked, and the total reflectance and irregular reflectance were obtained.
      <br/>
      It follows from the resultant data that a crystal grain can grow to a favorable size when the height difference (Rmax) was at least 0.01  MU m. On the other hand, regarding the total reflectance ratio and the irregular reflectance ratio, the height difference (Rmax) of 0.01  MU m or less results in the low irregular reflectance, and the height difference exceeds 1.50  MU m results in the low total reflectance.
    </p>
    <p num="1062">It is found that large size ZnO crystal grains and superior total and irregular can be obtained if suitable etching conditions are selected (Sample-EMB-D8-21 to 24, 30 to 33, 39 to 42, and 48 to 51).</p>
    <p num="1063">
      For the photovoltaic devices (EMB-D8-1 to EMB-D8-81), 5 sample devices were prepared for each as in Example D1, and each device was further divided into 25 sub-cells.
      <br/>
      For each of the photovoltaic devices, the yield was checked, and an adhesion test and the respective tests on the optical degradation, the high-humidity/temperature reverse bias (HHRB) degradation, and the temperature/humidity degradation were performed.
    </p>
    <p num="1064">Table D31 to Table D34 summarize the results.</p>
    <p num="1065">
      The evaluations mentioned above show the fact that the photovoltaic devices other EMB-D8-21 to 24, 30 to 33, 39 to 42, and 48 to 51 are inferior to the mentioned photovoltaic devices in yield and adhesion.
      <br/>
      The substrates in which each crystal grain size was less than 0.1  MU m or the Rmax (Difference) was less than 0.01  MU m were inferior in photoelectric conversion efficiency following each of the degradation periods.
      <br/>
      These facts are attributed to the decrease of FF due to the decrease of the series resistance mainly depending on the adhesion.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the substrates having a crystal grain size larger than 3000  MU m or Rmax (Subst.) larger than 1.50  MU ,_ are inferior in photoelectric conversion efficiency following each of the degradation periods.
      <br/>
      It is mainly attributed to the decrease of a short-circuit current (Jsc).
    </p>
    <p num="1066">As seen from the above, it can be concluded that the photovoltaic devices according to the present invention which feature the mean polycrystalline grain size of the polycrystalline substrate of 0.1  MU m to 2 mm and the Rmax (Difference) of 0.01  MU m to 1.5  MU m have superior characteristics and properties.</p>

    <p num="1068">
      In this Example, the height difference of a polycrystalline substrate was evaluated.
      <br/>
      In the same manner as in Example D8, photovoltaic devices were fabricated by using an acid solution for etching surfaces thereof and using stainless-steel (SUS430-BA, SUS430-2B, SUS430-2D, and mirror-finished SUS304) plates as the substrate material.

    <p num="1069">
      A surface of each plate was etched using the acid solution indicated in Table D35 in the same manner as in Example D8.
      <br/>
      A part of each of the substrate after the etching treatment was used for evaluations.
      <br/>
      For other part of the substrate, an Al reflection layer was deposited on the surface thereof in the same manner as in Example D8 according to the requirements indicated in Table D35.
      <br/>
      After the Al reflection layer was completely deposited, a ZnO transparent electrode layer was deposited on the reflection layer in the same manner as in Example D8 according to the requirements indicated in Table D35.
      <br/>
      After that, in the same manner as in Example D3, a pin-type semiconductor layer, an In2 O3 transparent electrode, and a collecting electrode were sequentially formed thereon according to the requirements indicated in Table D35, and thus the fabrication of the photovoltaic devices was completed.
    </p>
    <p num="1070">
      For each of he substrates prepared by processing in the same manner as in Example D8 until after the completion of the surface treatment, the surface configuration was observed, and the substrates having a crystal grain size of about 6.0  MU m and a Rmax (Difference) of about 0.2  MU m were selected.
      <br/>
      Then the distribution of Rmax of the selected substrates were obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="1071">As a result, it was found that the Rmax ranged from 0.005 to 3.5  MU m.</p>
    <p num="1072">
      In the same manner as in Example D8, photovoltaic devices were fabricated from these selected substrates.
      <br/>
      Then, for each of them, the yield was checked, and the adhesion test and the respective tests on the high-humidity/temperature reverse bias (HHRB) degradation and the temperature/humidity degradation were performed.
    </p>
    <p num="1073">Table D36 to Table D39 summarize the results.</p>
    <p num="1074">
      From the measurements, it was found that the substrates having an Rmax of 0.01 to 2.00  MU m produced favorable results.
      <br/>
      However, the substrates having an Rmax of 0.01  MU m or less result in low photoelectric conversion after the adhesion test.
      <br/>
      This is attributed to the decrease of FF due to the decrease of the series resistance mainly depending on the adhesion.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the substrates having an Rmax of 2.00  MU m or larger were not so inferior in yield and adhesion, but considerably inferior in photoelectric conversion efficiency following each of the other degradation tests.
      <br/>
      These are mainly attributed to the decrease of a short-circuit current (Jsc).
    </p>
    <p num="1075">As seen from the above, it can be concluded that the photovoltaic devices according to the present invention which have a height difference of the polycrystalline substrate of 0.01  MU m to 2 MU m have superior characteristics and properties.</p>
