      The present invention provides for the selective covalent modification of nucleic acids with redox active moieties such as transition metal complexes.
      <br/>
      Electron donor and electron acceptor moieties are covalently bound to the ribose-phosphate backbone of a nucleic acid at predetermined positions.
      <br/>
      The resulting complexes represent a series of new derivatives that are bimolecular templates capable of transferring electrons over very large distances at extremely fast rates.
      <br/>
      These complexes possess unique structural features which enable the use of an entirely new class of bioconductors and photoactive probes.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention is directed to electron transfer via nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention is directed to improvements in the site-selective modification of nucleic acids with electron transfer moieties.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The detection of specific nucleic acid sequences is an important tool for diagnostic medicine and molecular biology research.
      <br/>
      Gene probe assays currently play roles in identifying infectious organisms such as bacteria and viruses, in probing the expression of normal genes and identifying mutant genes such as oncogenes, in typing tissue for compatibility preceding tissue transplantation, in matching tissue or blood samples for forensic medicine, and for exploring homology among genes from different species.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Ideally, a gene probe assay should be sensitive, specific and easily automatable (for a review, see Nickerson, Current Opinion in Biotechnology 4:48-51 (1993)).
      <br/>
      The requirement for sensitivity (i.e. low detection limits) has been greatly alleviated by the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other amplification technologies which allow researchers to amplify exponentially a specific nucleic acid sequence before analysis (for a review, see Abramson et al., Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 4:41-47 (1993)).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Specificity, in contrast, remains a problem in many currently available gene probe assays.
      <br/>
      The extent of molecular complementarity between probe and target defines the specificity of the interaction.
      <br/>
      Variations in the concentrations of probes, of targets and of salts in the hybridization medium, in the reaction temperature, and in the length of the probe may alter or influence the specificity of the probe/target interaction.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It may be possible under some limited circumstances to distinguish targets with perfect complementarity from targets with mismatches, although this is generally very difficult using traditional technology, since small variations in the reaction conditions will alter the hybridization.
      <br/>
      New experimental techniques for mismatch detection with standard probes include DNA ligation assays where single point mismatches prevent ligation and probe digestion assays in which mismatches create sites for probe cleavage.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Finally, the automation of gene probe assays remains an area in which current technologies are lacking.
      <br/>
      Such assays generally rely on the hybridization of a labeled probe to a target sequence followed by the separation of the unhybridized free probe.
      <br/>
      This separation is generally achieved by gel electrophoresis or solid phase capture and washing of the target DNA, and is generally quite difficult to automate easily.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The time consuming nature of these separation steps has led to two distinct avenues of development.
      <br/>
      One involves the development of high-speed, high-throughput automatable electrophoretic and other separation techniques.
      <br/>
      The other involves the development of non-separation homogeneous gene probe assays.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      For example, Gen-Probe Inc., (San Diego, Calif.) has developed a homogeneous protection assay in which hybridized probes are protected from base hydrolysis, and thus are capable of subsequent chemiluminescence. (Okwumabua et al.
      <br/>
      Res. Microbiol. 143:183 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the reliance of this approach on a chemiluminescent substrate known for high background photon emission suggests this assay will not have high specificity.
      <br/>
      EPO application number 86116652.8 describes an attempt to use non-radiative energy transfer from a donor probe to an acceptor probe as a homogeneous detection scheme.
      <br/>
      However, the fluorescence energy transfer is greatly influenced by both probe topology and topography, and the DNA target itself is capable of significant energy quenching, resulting in considerable variability.
      <br/>
      Therefore there is a need for DNA probes which are specific, capable of detecting target mismatches, and capable of being incorporated into an automated system for sequence identification.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      As outlined above, molecular biology relies quite heavily on modified or labeled oligonucleotides for traditional gene probe assays (Oligonucleotide Synthesis: A Practical Approach.
      <br/>
      Gait et al., Ed., IRL Press: Oxford, UK, 1984; Oligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach.
      <br/>
      Ed. F. Eckstein, Oxford University Press, 1991).
      <br/>
      As a result, several techniques currently exist for the synthesis of tailored nucleic acid molecules.
      <br/>
      Since nucleic acids do not naturally contain functional groups to which molecules of interest may easily be attached covalently, methods have been developed which allow chemical modification at either of the terminal phosphates or at the heterocyclic bases (Dreyer et al.
      <br/>
      Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1985, 82:968).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      For example, analogues of the common deoxyribo- and ribonucleosides which contain amino groups at the 2' or 3' position of the sugar can be made using established chemical techniques. (See Imazawa et al., J. Org. Chem., 1979, 44:2039; Imazawa et al., J. Org. Chem. 43(15):3044 (1978); Verheyden et al., J. Org. Chem. 36(2):250 (1971); Hobbs et al., J. Org. Chem. 42(4):714 (1977)).
      <br/>
      In addition, oligonucleotides may be synthesized with 2'-5' or 3'-5' phosphoamide linkages (Beaucage et al., Tetrahedron 49(10):1925 (1992); Letsinger, J. Org. Chem., 35:3800 (1970); Sawai, Chem.
      <br/>
      Left. 805 (1984); Oligonucleotides ;and Analogues: A Practical Approach, F. Eckstein, Ed.
      <br/>
      Oxford University Press (1991)).
    </p>
    <p num="12">The modification of nucleic acids has been done for two general reasons: to create nonradioactive DNA markers to serve as probes, and to use chemically modified DNA to obtain site-specific cleavage.</p>
    <p num="13">
      To this end, DNA may be labeled to serve as a probe by altering a nucleotide which then serves as a replacement analogue in the nick translational resynthesis of double stranded DNA.
      <br/>
      The chemically altered nucleotides may then provide reactive sites for the attachment of immunological or other labels such as biotin. (Gilliam et al., Anal. Biochem. 157:199 (1986)).
      <br/>
      Another example uses ruthenium derivatives which intercalate into DNA to produce photoluminescence under defined conditions. (Friedman et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112:4960 (1990)).
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In the second category, there are a number of examples of compounds covalently linked to DNA which subsequently cause DNA chain cleavage.
      <br/>
      For example 1,10-phenanthroline has been coupled to single-stranded oligothymidylate via a linker which results in the cleavage of poly-dA oligonucleotides in the presence of Cu2+ and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (Francois et al., Biochemistry 27:2272 (1988)).
      <br/>
      Similar experiments have been done for EDTA1 -Fe(II) (both for double stranded DNA (Boutorin et al., FEBS Lett. 172:43-46 (1986)) and triplex DNA (Strobel et al., Science 249:73 (1990)), porphyrin-Fe(III) (Le Doan et al., Biochemistry 25:6736-6739 (1986)), and 1,10-phenanthronine-Cu(I) (Chen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 83:7147 (1985)), which all result in DNA chain cleavage in the presence of a reducing agent in aerated solutions.
      <br/>
      A similar example using porphyrins resulted in DNA strand cleavage, and base oxidation or cross-linking of the DNA under very specific conditions (Le Doan et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 15:8643 (1987)).
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Other work has focused on chemical modification of heterocyclic bases.
      <br/>
      For example, the attachment of an inorganic coordination complex, Fe-EDTA, to a modified internal base resulted in cleavage of the DNA after hybridization in the presence of dioxygen (Dreyer et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:968 (1985)).
      <br/>
      A ruthenium compound has been coupled successfully to an internal base in a DNA octomer, with retention of both the DNA hybridization capabilities as well as the spectroscopic properties of the ruthenium label (Telser et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:7221 (1989)).
      <br/>
      Other experiments have successfully added two separate spectroscopic labels to a single double-stranded DNA molecule (Telser et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:7226 (1989)).
    </p>
    <p num="16">The study of electron transfer reactions in proteins and DNA has also been explored in pursuit of systems which are capable of long distance electron transfer.</p>
    <p num="17">
      To this end, intramolecular electron transfer in protein--protein complexes, such as those found in photosynthetic proteins and proteins in the respiration pathway, has been shown to take place over appreciable distances in protein interiors at biologically significant rates (see Bowler et al., Progress in Inorganic Chemistry: Bioinorganic Chemistry, Vol. 38, Ed. Stephen J. Lippard (1990).
      <br/>
      In addition, the selective modification of metalloenzymes with transition metals has been accomplished and techniques to monitor electron transfer in these systems developed.
      <br/>
      For example, electron transfer proteins such as cytochrome c have been modified with ruthenium through attachment at several histidines and the rate of electron transfer from the heme Fe2+ to the bound Ru3+ measured.
      <br/>
      The results suggest that electron transfer "tunnel" pathways may exist. (Baum, Chemical &amp; Engineering News, Feb. 22, 1993, pages 2023; see also Chang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113:7056 (1991)).
      <br/>
      In related work, the normal protein insulation, which protects the redox centers of an enzyme or protein from nondiscriminatory reactions with the exterior solvent, was "wired" to transform these systems from electrical insulators into electrical conductors (Heller, Acc.
      <br/>
      Chem. Res. 23:128 (1990)).

    <p num="18">
      There are a few reports of photoinduced electron transfer in a DNA matrix.
      <br/>
      In these systems, the electron donors and acceptors are not covalently attached to the DNA, but randomly associated with the DNA, thus rendering the explicit elucidation and control of the donor-acceptor system difficult.
      <br/>
      For example, the intense fluorescence of certain quaternary diazoaromatic salts is quenched upon intercalation into DNA or upon exposure to individual mononucleotides, thus exhibiting electron donor processes within the DNA itself. (Brun et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113:8153 (1991)).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Another example of the difficulty of determining the electron transfer mechanism is found in work done with some photoexcitable ruthenium compounds.
      <br/>
      Early work suggested that certain ruthenium compounds either randomly intercalate into the nucleotide bases, or bind to the helix surface. (Purugganan et al., Science 241:1645 (1988)).
      <br/>
      A recent reference indicates that certain ruthenium compounds do not intercalate into the DNA (Satyanarayana et al., Biochemistry 31(39):9319 (1992)); rather, they bind non-covalently to the surface of the DNA helix.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In these early experiments, various electron acceptor compounds, such as cobalt, chromium or rhodium compounds were added to certain DNA-associated ruthenium electron donor compounds. (Puragganan et al., Science 241:1645 (1988); Orellana et al., Photochem.
      <br/>
      Photobiol. 499:54 (1991); Brun et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113:8153 (1991); Davis, Chem.-Biol. Interactions 62:45 (1987); Tomalia et al., Acc. Chem. Res., 24:332 (1991)).
      <br/>
      Upon addition of these various electron acceptor compounds, which randomly bind non-covalently to the helix, quenching of the photoexcited state through electron transfer was detected.
      <br/>
      The rate of quenching was dependent on both the individual electron donor and acceptor as well as their concentrations, thus revealing the process as bimolecular.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In one set of experiments, the authors postulate that the more mobile surface bound donor promotes electron transfer with greater efficiency than the intercalated species, and suggest that the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA, and possibly the solvent medium surrounding the DNA, play a significant role in the electron transport. (Purugganan et al., Science 241:1645 (1988)).
      <br/>
      In other work, the authors stress the dependence of the rate on the mobility of the donor and acceptor and their local concentrations, and assign the role of the DNA to be primarily to facilitate an increase in local concentration of the donor and acceptor species on the helix. (Orellana et al., supra).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In another experiment, an electron donor was reportedly randomly intercalated into the stack of bases of DNA, while the acceptor was randomly associated with the surface of the DNA.
      <br/>
      The rate of electron transfer quenching indicated a close contact of the donor and the acceptor, and the system also exhibits enhancement of the rate of electron transfer with the addition of salt to the medium. (Fromherz et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103:5361 (1986)).
    </p>
    <p num="23">In all of these experiments, the rate of electron transfer for non-covalently bound donors and acceptors is several orders of magnitude less than is seen in free solution.</p>
    <p num="24">
      An important stimulus for the development of long distance electron transfer systems is the creation of synthetic light harvesting systems.
      <br/>
      Work to date suggests that an artificial light harvesting system contains an energy transfer complex, an energy migration complex, an electron transfer complex and an electron migration complex (for a topical review of this area, see Chemical &amp; Engineering News, Mar. 15, 1993, pages 38-48).
      <br/>
      Two types of molecules have been tried: a) long organic molecules, such as hydrocarbons with covalently attached electron transfer species, or DNA, with intercalated, partially intercalated or helix associated electron transfer species, and b) synthetic polymers.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The long organic molecules, while quite rigid, are influenced by a number of factors, which makes development difficult.
      <br/>
      These factors include the polarity and composition of the solvent, the orientation of the donor and acceptor groups, and the chemical character of either the covalent linkage or the association of the electron transfer species to the molecule.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The creation of acceptable polymer electron transfer systems has been difficult because the available polymers are too flexible, such that several modes of transfer occur.
      <br/>
      Polymers that are sufficiently rigid often significantly interfere with the electron transfer mechanism or are quite difficult to synthesize.
    </p>
    <p num="27">Thus the development of an electron transfer system which is sufficiently rigid, has covalently attached electron transfer species at defined intervals, is easy to synthesize and does not appreciably interfere with the electron transfer mechanism would be useful in the development of artificial light harvesting systems.</p>
    <p num="28">
      In conclusion, the random distribution and mobility of the electron donor and acceptor pairs, coupled with potential short distances between the donor and acceptor, the loose and presumably reversible association of the donors and acceptors, the reported dependence on solvent and broad putative electron pathways, and the disruption of the DNA structure of intercalated compounds rendering normal base pairing impossible all serve as pronounced limitations of long range electron transfer in a DNA matrix.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a method for the production of rigid, covalent attachment of electron donors and acceptors to provide minimal perturbations of the nucleic acid structure and retention of its ability to base pair normally, is desirable.
      <br/>
      The present invention serves to provide such a system, which allows the development of novel bioconductors and diagnostic probes.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="29">
      The present invention provides for the modification of nucleic acids at specific sites with redox active moieties such as transition metal complexes.
      <br/>
      An electron donor and/or electron acceptor moiety are covalently bound at predetermined positions.
      <br/>
      The resulting complexes represent a series of new derivatives that are biomolecular templates capable of transferring electrons over very large distances at extremely fast rates.
      <br/>
      These complexes possess unique structural features which enable the use of an entirely new class of bioconductors and diagnostic probes.

      FIG. 5 is a schematic showing transition metals bound to the ribose-phosphate backbone in a variety of positions. M is a transition metal. M1 is bound via an amine on the 2' carbon of the ribose; an electron must travel through 4  SIGMA  bonds to enter the pi-orbitals (the "pi-way") of the stacked bases. M2 and M3 are bound via a phosphoramide-type linkages, and electrons must travel through 7  SIGMA  bonds to enter the pi-way, respectively.

    <p num="32">
      Unless otherwise stated, the term "nucleic acid" or "oligonucleotide" or grammatical equivalents herein means at least two nucleotides covalently linked together.
      <br/>
      A nucleic acid of the present invention will generally contain phosphodiester bonds, although in some cases, as outlined below, a nucleic acid analogs are included that may have alternate backbones, comprising, for example, phosphoramide (Beaucage et al., Tetrahedron 49(10):1925 (1993) and references therein; Letsinger, J. Org. Chem. 35:3800 (1970); Sprinzl et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 81:579 (1977); Letsinger et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 14:3487 (1986); Sawai et al, Chem.

      Chemica Scripta 26:141 91986)), phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, O-methylphophoroamidite linkages (see Eckstein, Oligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach, Oxford University Press), and peptide nucleic acid backbones and linkages (see Egholm, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114:1895 (1992); Meier et al., Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 31:1008 (1992); Nielsen, Nature, 365:566 (1993); Carlsson et al., Nature 380:207 (1996), all of which are incorporated by reference).
      <br/>
      These modifications of the ribose-phosphate backbone may be done to facilitate the addition of electron transfer moieties, or to increase the stability and half-life of such molecules in physiological environments.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Particularly preferred are peptide nucleic acids (PNA).
      <br/>
      This backbone is substantially non-ionic under neutral conditions, in contrast to the highly charged phosphodiester backbone of naturally occurring nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      This results in two advantages.
      <br/>
      First, this backbone exhibits improved hybridization kinetics.
      <br/>
      PNAs have larger changes in the melting temperature (Tm) for mismatched versus perfectly matched basepairs.
      <br/>
      DNA and RNA typically exhibit a 2-4 (degree)  C. drop in Tm for an internal mismatch.
      <br/>
      With the non-ionic backbone of PNA, the drop is closer to 7-9 (degree)  C. This allows for better detection of mismatches.
      <br/>
      Similarly, due to their non-ionic nature, hybridization of the bases attached to these backbones is relatively insensitive to salt concentration.
      <br/>
      This is particularly advantageous in the systems of the present invention, as a reduced salt hybridization solution has a lower Faradaic current than a physiological salt solution (in the range of 150 mM).
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The nucleic acids may be single stranded or double stranded, as specified, or contain portions of both double stranded or single stranded sequence.
      <br/>
      The nucleic acid may be DNA, both genomic and cDNA, RNA or a hybrid, where the nucleic acid contains any combination of deoxyribo- and ribo-nucleotides, and any combination of bases, including uracil, adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, inosine, xathanine and hypoxathanine, etc.
      <br/>
      In some instances, e.g. in the case of an "intervening nucleic acid", the term nucleic acid refers to one or more nucleosides.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term "nucleoside" includes nucleotides.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The terms "electron donor moiety", "electron acceptor moiety", and "electron transfer moieties" or grammatical equivalents herein refers to molecules capable of electron transfer under certain conditions.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that electron donor and acceptor capabilities are relative; that is, a molecule which can lose an electron under certain experimental conditions will be able to accept an electron under different experimental conditions.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the number of possible electron donor moieties and electron acceptor moieties is very large, and that one skilled in the art of electron transfer compounds will be able to utilize a number of compounds in the present invention.
      <br/>
      Preferred electron transfer moieties include, but are not limited to, transition metal complexes, organic electron transfer moieties, and electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In a preferred embodiment, the electron transfer moieties are transition metal complexes.
      <br/>
      Transition metals are those whose atoms have an incomplete d shell of electrons.

      <br/>
      That is, the first series of transition metal, the platinum metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt), along with Re, W, Mo and Tc, are preferred.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred are ruthenium, rhenium, osmium, platinium and iron.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The transition metals are complexed with a variety of ligands to form suitable transition metal complexes, as is well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Suitable ligands include, but are not limited to, --NH2 ; pyridine; pyrazine; isonicotinamide; imidazole; bipyridine and substituted derivative of bipyridine; phenanthrolines, particularly 1,10-phenanthroline (abbreviated phen) and substituted derivatives of phenanthrolines such as 4,7-dimethylphenanthroline; dipyridophenazine; 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene (abbreviated hat); 9,10-phenanthrenequinone diimine; 1,4,5,8-tetraazaphenanthrene (abbreviated tap); 1,4,8,11-tetra-azacyclotetradecane; diaminopyridine (abbreviated damp); porphyrins and substituted derivatives of the porphyrin family.

    <p num="44">
      In one embodiment, the electron donors and acceptors are redox proteins as are known in the art.
      <br/>
      However, redox proteins in many embodiments are not preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In a particularly preferred embodiment, an electron transfer moiety comprises an solid support such as an electrode to which the nucleic acid is attached, covalently or otherwise.
      <br/>
      That is, the electrode serves as either the electron donor or acceptor, as is more fully described below.
      <br/>
      The techniques used in this embodiment are analogous to the wiring of proteins to an electrode except that the nucleic acids of the present invention are used rather than a redox protein (see for example Gregg et al., J. Phys. Chem. 95:5970 (1991); Heller et al., Sensors and Actuators R., 13-14:180 (1993); and Pishko et al., Anal. Chem., 63:2268 (1991)).

    <p num="46">Electrode attachment is utilized in initiating electron transfer via an applied potential and for electronic methods of electron transfer monitoring.</p>
    <p num="47">
      In a preferred embodiment, electron transport between the electrode and the nucleic acid can be indirect, utilizing electron transport mediators which are free in solution or imbedded in a gel or polymer to provide a type of electronic coupling between the electrode and the nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the electron transfer moiety-modified nucleic acids of the invention are attached via such a matrix.
      <br/>
      Matrix attachment has several advantages for use in a nucleic acid gene sensor.
      <br/>
      Because of the 3-dimensional nature of the polymer, large numbers of modified nucleic acid probes can be attached to a small surface area of electrode.
      <br/>
      Using a highly porous "hydrogel," rates of nucleic acid hybridization can be quite high, nearly matching that of nucleic acid in solution.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      For example, polymers with covalently attached redox molecules behave as highly effective electron transfer mediators.
      <br/>
      Siloxane and ethylene oxide polymers, modified with ferrocene molecules, demonstrated electron transfer between enzymes and an electrode; for example, flexible siloxane and ethylene oxide polymers covalently attached to ferrocene or Os(bpy)2 have been shown to be highly effective redox polymers for mediating electron transfer from several enzymes to an electrode. (see Boguslavsky et al., Solid State Ionics, V. 60, p. 189, (1993)).
      <br/>
      Similarly, a redox-conducting epoxy cement has been prepared (see Hellar et al., J. Phys. Chem., 95:5970 (1991)).
      <br/>
      Cross linked redox gels for amperometric biosensors applications have also been prepared with glucose oxidase electrically connected to electrodes so that electrons were shown to flow from the enzyme, through the polymer and to the electrode (see Hellar, A., et. al., Anal. Chem., 62, 258, (1990)).
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      In this embodiment, it is preferred that a redox polymer such as a poly-(vinylpyridine) complex of Os(bby)2 Cl be cross-linked with an epoxide such as diepoxide to form a redox-conducting epoxide cement which is capable of strongly binding to electrodes made of conductive material such as gold, vitreous carbon, graphite, and other conductive materials.
      <br/>
      This strong attachment is included in the definition of "covalently attached" for the purposes of this embodiment.
      <br/>
      The epoxide cross-linking polymer is then reacted with, for example, an exposed amine, such as the amine of an amino-modified nucleic acid described above, covalently attaching the nucleic acid to the complex, forming a "redox hydrogel" on the surface of the electrode.

      The present invention is directed, in part, to the site-selective modification of nucleic acids with redox active moieties such as transition metal complexes for the preparation of a new series of biomaterials capable of long distance electron transfer through a nucleic acid matrix.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides for the precise placement of electron transfer donor and acceptor moieties at predetermined sites on a single stranded or double stranded nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      In general, electron transfer between electron donor and acceptor moieties in a double helical nucleic acid does not occur at an appreciable rate unless nucleotide base pairing exists in the sequence between the electron donor and acceptor in the double helical structure.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      This differential in the rate of electron transfer forms the basis of a utility of the present invention for use as probes.
      <br/>
      In the system of the present invention, where electron transfer moieties are covalently bound to the backbone of a nucleic acid, the electrons putatively travel via the  PI -orbitals of the stacked base pairs of the double stranded nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      The electron transfer rate is dependent on several factors, including the distance between the electron donor-acceptor pair, the free energy ( DELTA G) of the reaction, the reorganization energy ( LAMBDA ), the contribution of the intervening medium, the orientation and electronic coupling of the donor and acceptor pair, and the hydrogen bonding between the bases.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The contribution of the intervening medium depends, in part, on the number of sigma ( SIGMA ) bonds the electron must traverse from the electron donor to reach the bases stack, or to exit the stack to reach the electron acceptor.
      <br/>
      As is shown in FIG. 5, when the metal is bound to the ribose-phosphate backbone via an amine moiety at the 2' carbon of the ribose, an electron must travel through four  SIGMA  bonds to reach the stack: the metal to nitrogen bond, the nitrogen to 2' carbon bond, and from the 2' carbon to the base, or vice versa depending on the direction of the electron flow.
      <br/>
      Since the base of the nucleotide is conjugated in some degree, the base can be considered to be the edge of the " PI -way"; that is, the conjugated  PI  orbitals of the stacked base pairs.
      <br/>
      When the metal is bound to the ribose-phosphate backbone via the 3' carbon of the ribose, an electron must traverse through 5  SIGMA  bonds.
      <br/>
      When the metal is bound via phosphoramide-type linkages, an electron must traverse through 7  SIGMA  bonds.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiments, the compositions of the invention are designed such that the electron transfer moieties are as close to the "pi-way" as possible without significantly disturbing the secondary and tertiary structure of the double helical nucleic acid, particularly the Watson-Crick basepairing.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The effect on the electron transfer rate by the hydrogen bonding between the bases is a dependence on the actual nucleic acid sequence, since A-T pairs contain one less hydrogen bond than C-G pairs.
      <br/>
      However, this sequence dependence is overshadowed by the determination that there is a measurable difference between the rate of electron transfer within a DNA base-pair matrix, and the rate through the ribose-phosphate backbone, the solvent or other electron tunnels.
      <br/>
      This rate differential is thought to be at least several orders of magnitude, and may be as high as four orders of magnitude greater through the stacked nucleotide bases as compared to other electron transfer pathways.
      <br/>
      Thus the presence of double stranded nucleic acids, for example in gene probe assays, can be determined by comparing the rate of electron transfer for the unhybridized probe with the rate for hybridized probes.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      In one embodiment, the present invention provides for novel gene probes, which are useful in molecular biology and diagnostic medicine.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, single stranded nucleic acids having a predetermined sequence and covalently attached electron donor and electron acceptor moieties are synthesized.
      <br/>
      The sequence is selected based upon a known target sequence, such that if hybridization to a complementary target sequence occurs in the region between the electron donor and the electron acceptor, electron transfer proceeds at an appreciable and detectable rate.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention has broad general use, as a new form of labeled gene probe.
      <br/>
      In addition, since detectable electron transfer in unhybridized probes is not appreciable, the probes of the present invention allow detection of target sequences without the removal of unhybridized probe.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention is uniquely suited to automated gene probe assays or field testing.

      In a preferred embodiment, the probes are used in genetic diagnosis.

      In an additional embodiment, viral and bacterial detection is done using the complexes of the invention.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, probes are designed to detect target sequences from a variety of bacteria and viruses.
      <br/>
      For example, current blood-screening techniques rely on the detection of anti-HIV antibodies.
      <br/>
      The methods disclosed herein allow for direct screening of clinical samples to detect HIV nucleic acid sequences, particularly highly conserved HIV sequences.
      <br/>
      In addition, this allows direct monitoring of circulating virus within a patient as an improved method of assessing the efficacy of anti-viral therapies.
      <br/>
      Similarly, viruses associated with leukemia, HTLV-I and HTLV-II, may be detected in this way.
      <br/>
      Bacterial infections such as tuberculosis may also be detected.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acids of the invention find use as probes for toxic bacteria in the screening of water and food samples.
      <br/>
      For example, samples may be treated to lyse the bacteria to release its nucleic acid, and then probes designed to recognize bacterial strains, including, but not limited to, such pathogenic strains as, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Vibrio cholerae, enterotoxic strains of E. coli, and Legionnaire's disease bacteria.
      <br/>
      Similarly, bioremediation strategies may be evaluated using the compositions of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="74">In a further embodiment, the probes are used for forensic "DNA fingerprinting" to match crime-scene DNA against samples taken from victims and suspects.</p>
    <p num="75">
      The present invention also finds use as a unique methodology for the detection of mutations in target nucleic acid sequences.
      <br/>
      As a result, if a single stranded nucleic acid containing electron transfer moieties is hybridized to a target sequence with a mutation, the resulting perturbation of the base pairing of the nucleosides will measurably affect the electron transfer rate.
      <br/>
      This is the case if the mutation is a substitution, insertion or deletion.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, two single stranded nucleic acids each with a covalently attached electron transfer species that hybridize adjacently to a target sequence may be used.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the present invention provides for the detection of mutations in target sequences.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Thus, the present invention provides for extremely specific and sensitive probes, which may, in some embodiments, detect target sequences without removal of unhybridized probe.
      <br/>
      This will be useful in the generation of automated gene probe assays.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      In an alternate embodiment double stranded nucleic acids have covalently attached electron donor and electron acceptor moieties on opposite strands.
      <br/>
      Such nucleic acids are useful to detect successful gene amplification in polymerase chain reactions (PCR), thus allowing successful PCR reactions to be an indication of the presence or absence of a target sequence.
      <br/>
      PCR may be used in this manner in several ways.
      <br/>
      For example, if one of the two PCR primers contains a 5' terminally attached electron donor, and the other contains a 5' terminally attached electron acceptor, several rounds of PCR will generate doubly labeled double stranded fragments (occasionally referred to as "amplicons").
      <br/>
      After appropriate photoinduction, the detection of electron transfer provides an indication of the successful amplification of the target sequence as compared to when no amplification occurs.
      <br/>
      A particular advantage of the present invention is that the separation of the single stranded primers from the amplified double stranded DNA is not necessary, as outlined above for probe sequences which contain electron transfer moieties.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the detection of a target sequence via PCR is done by attaching one electron transfer moiety species to one or both of the primers.
      <br/>
      The other electron transfer moiety species is attached to individual nucleosides of the PCR reaction pool, as is described herein.
      <br/>
      Incorporation of the nucleosides containing the electron transfer moiety into the nucleic acid during the PCR reaction results in both electron transfer species being attached either to the same single strand or to opposite strands, or both.
      <br/>
      Allowing the newly synthesized nucleic acid to remain in a hybridized form allows the detection of successful elongation via electron transfer, and thus the detection of a target sequence.
      <br/>
      In this way, the present invention is used for PCR detection of target sequences

    <p num="78">
      In another embodiment the present invention provides for double stranded nucleic acids with covalently attached electron donor and electron acceptor moieties to serve as bioconductors or "molecular wire".
      <br/>
      The electron transport may occur over distances up to and in excess of 28  Angstrom  per electron donor and acceptor pair.
      <br/>
      In addition, the rate of electron transfer is very fast, even though dependent on the distance between the electron donor and acceptor moieties.
      <br/>
      By modifying the nucleic acid in regular intervals with electron donor and/or electron acceptor moieties, it may be possible to transport electrons over long distances, thus creating bioconductors.
      <br/>
      These bioconductors are useful in a large number of applications, including traditional applications for conductors such as mediators for electrochemical reactions and processes.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      In addition, these bioconductors may be useful as probes for photosynthesis reactions as well as in the construction of synthetic light harvesting systems.
      <br/>
      The current models for the electron transfer component of an artificial light harvesting system have several problems, as outlined above, including a dependence on solvent polarity and composition, and a lack of sufficient rigidity without arduous synthesis.

      As shown in FIG. 5, several positions are possible, with attachment to a ribose of the ribose-phosphate backbone being particularly preferred.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in FIG. 5, the most preferred site of attachment of a electron transfer moiety is M1, followed by M4, M2 and M3, in that order.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the electron transfer moieties are attached at the 2' or 3' position on the ribose, with 2' being particularly preferred.

    <p num="83">
      In a preferred embodiment, the electron transfer moieties do not intercalate, and are attached such that do not intercalate.
      <br/>
      Thus, while it is possible to utilize a "linker", such as alternating double bonds to attach the electron transfer moiety to the nucleic acid, the linker is either preferably not longer than the equivalent of one or two nucleosides in length, or is not significantly flexible to allow intercalation.

      In one embodiment, the electron transfer moieties are added to the bases of the terminal nucleosides.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the target sequence to be detected is n nucleosides long, a probe can be made which has an extra terminal nucleoside at one or both of the ends of the nucleic acid (n+1 or n+2), which are used to covalently attach the electron transfer moieties but which do not participate in basepair hybridization.
      <br/>
      This extra terminal nucleoside is important since attachment of electron transfer moieties to an internal nucleoside base is expected to perturb Watson-Crick basepairing.
      <br/>
      That is, the base used for covalent attachment should be outside of the region used to identify the target sequence.
      <br/>
      Additionally, it is preferred that upon probe hybridization, the terminal nucleoside containing the electron transfer moiety covalently attached at the base be directly adjacent to Watson-Crick basepaired nucledsides; that is, the electron transfer moiety should be as close as possible to the stacked  PI -orbitals of the bases such that an electron travels through a minimum of  SIGMA  bonds to reach the " PI -way", or alternatively can otherwise electronically contact the  PI -way.

      <br/>
      Molecular mechanics calculations indicate that perturbations due to the modification of at the ribose of the terminal nucleosides of nucleic acids are minimal, and Watson-Crick base pairing is not disrupted (unpublished data using Biograf from Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, Calif.).

      Alternatively, and preferably, the amino nucleoside is converted to the phosphoramidite or H-phosphonate form, which are then used in solid-phase or solution syntheses of oligonucleotides.
      <br/>
      In this way the modified nucleoside, either for attachment at the ribose (i.e. amino- or thiol-modified nucleosides) or the base, is incorporated into the oligonucleotide at either an internal position or the 5' terminus.
      <br/>
      This is generally done by protecting the 5' position of the ribose with 4',4-dimethoxytrityl (DMT) followed by reaction with 2-cyanoethoxy-bis-diisopropylaminophosphine in the presence of diisopropylammonium tetrazolide to give the phosphoramidite as is known in the art; although other techniques may be used as will be appreciated by those in the art.

      For attachment of an electron transfer moiety to the 3' terminus, a preferred method utilizes the attachment of the modified nucleoside to controlled pore glass (CPG) or other polymeric supports.

      In one embodiment, the nucleosides are modified to contain an aromatic amine capable of binding an electron transfer moiety at either the 2' or 3' position of the ribose.

      For example, one of the nitrogens of imidazole can be attached at the 2' or 3' position of the ribose and thus used to attach the electron transfer moiety such as a transition metal complex.
      <br/>
      This may effectively reduce the number of  SIGMA  bonds an electron must travel through to reach the "pi-way" since the imidazole offers substantially less resistance to electron transfer as compared to a  SIGMA  bond.

      It should be understood that it is important that the basepairing of the nucleoside bases is not significantly perturbed in order to allow hybridization, good electron transfer rates, and the detection of mismatches.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, the transition metal moieties, when attached to the nucleic acids of the invention, do not intercalate, i.e. insert and stack between the basepairs of the double stranded nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      Intercalation of the transition metals with the accompanying ligands disturbs the basepairing, and thus hinders the transfer of electrons and the identification of mismatches.
      <br/>
      Similarly, with the exception of terminal bases, as is outlined below, attaching the transition metal complexes at the nucleoside bases (Telser et al., supra) also disturbs the basepairing and impedes the identification of mismatches.

      Addition to the carboxy terminus can proceed in a variety of ways, one of which is depicted in FIG. 7.

      Additionally, for single stranded PNAs, one electron transfer moiety may be attached to the N-terminus, and the other electron transfer moiety is attached to the terminal base at the carboxy terminus.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, both transfer moieties are attached to terminal bases.

      Similar combinations may be made for two single stranded nucleic acids, each containing an electron transfer moiety.

      In this embodiment, the modified single strand nucleic acid is hybridized to an unmodified complementary sequence.

      This blocks the sites on the heterocyclic bases that are susceptible to attack by the transition metal electron transfer species.

    <p num="110">
      When the terminal bases are to be labeled with electron transfer species, the complementary sequence does not extend to the base to be labeled.

      That is, a complementary sequence of n nucleosides in length is chosen for hybridization to a probe sequence of n+1 or n+2, such that the terminal base is not protected.
      <br/>
      Thus the unprotected base is exposed to the electron transfer moiety such that the moiety is attached to the base.

      The electron donor and electron acceptor moieties may be attached at either the 5' or 3' end of the single stranded nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the electron transfer moieties may be attached to internal nucleosides, or one to an internal nucleoside and one to a terminal nucleoside.
      <br/>
      It should be understood that the orientation of the electron transfer species with respect to the 5'-3' orientation of the nucleic acid is not determinative.

      In an alternate preferred embodiment, single stranded nucleic acids with at least one electron donor moiety and at least one electron acceptor moiety are used to detect mutations in a complementary target sequence.
      <br/>
      A mutation, whether it be a substitution, insertion or deletion of a nucleoside or nucleosides, results in incorrect base pairing in a hybridized double helix of nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if the path of an electron from an electron donor moiety to an electron acceptor moiety spans the region where the mismatch lies, the electron transfer will be eliminated or reduced such that a change in the relative rate will be seen.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in this embodiment, the electron donor moiety is attached to the nucleic acid at a 5' position from the mutation, and the electron acceptor moiety is attached at a 3' position, or vice versa.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      In this embodiment it is also possible to use an additional label on the modified single stranded nucleic acid to detect hybridization where there is one or more mismatches.
      <br/>
      If the complementary target nucleic acid contains a mutation, electron transfer is reduced or eliminated.
      <br/>
      To act as a control, the modified single stranded nucleic acid may be radio- or fluorescently labeled, such that hybridization to the target sequence may be detected, according to traditional molecular biology techniques.
      <br/>
      This allows for the determination that the target sequence exists but contains a substitution, insertion or deletion of one or more nucleosides.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, single stranded nucleic acids with at least one electron donor moiety and one electron acceptor moiety which hybridize to regions with exact matches can be used as a controls for the presence of the target sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      It is to be understood that the rate of electron transfer through a double stranded nucleic acid helix depends on the nucleoside distance between the electron donor and acceptor moieties.
      <br/>
      Longer distances will have slower rates, and consideration of the rates will be a parameter in the design of probes and bioconductors.
      <br/>
      Thus, while it is possible to measure rates for distances in excess of 100 nucleosides, a preferred embodiment has the electron donor moiety and the electron acceptor moiety separated by at least 3 and no more than 100 nucleosides.
      <br/>
      More preferably the moieties are separated by 8 to 64 nucleosides, with 15 being the most preferred distance.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      In addition, it should be noted that certain distances may allow the utilization of different detection systems.
      <br/>
      For example, the sensitivity of some detection systems may allow the detection of extremely fast rates; i.e. the electron transfer moieties may be very close together.
      <br/>
      Other detection systems may require slightly slower rates, and this allow the electron transfer moieties to be farther apart.

    <p num="117">
      In an alternate embodiment, a single stranded nucleic acid is modified with more than one electron donor or acceptor moiety.
      <br/>
      For example, to increase the signal obtained from these probes, or decrease the required detector sensitivity, multiple sets of electron donor-acceptor pairs may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      As outlined above, in some embodiments different electron transfer moieties are added to a single stranded nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      For example, when an electron donor moiety and an electron acceptor moiety are to be added, or several different electron donors and electron acceptors, the synthesis of the single stranded nucleic acid proceeds in several steps.
      <br/>
      First partial nucleic acid sequences are made, each containing a single electron transfer species, i.e. either a single transfer moiety or several of the same transfer moieties, using the techniques outlined above.
      <br/>
      Then these partial nucleic acid sequences are ligated together using techniques common in the art, such as hybridization of the individual modified partial nucleic acids to a complementary single strand, followed by ligation with a commercially available ligase.

    <p num="119">
      Alternatively, single stranded nucleic acid may be made by incorporating an amino modified nucleoside at two positions using the above techniques.
      <br/>
      As a result of the synthesis, one of the amino modified nucleosides has a temporary protecting group on the amine such as DMT.
      <br/>
      Upon hybridization to the complementary unmodified strand, the unprotected amine is exposed to the first electron transfer moiety, i.e. either a donor or an acceptor, resulting in covalent attachment.
      <br/>
      The protecting group of the protected amino-modified nucleoside is then removed, and the hybrid is contacted with the second electron transfer species, and the strands separated, resulting in a single strand being labeled with both a donor and acceptor.

      The single strand containing the proper electron transfer moieties is then purified using traditional techniques.

      It is to be understood that different species of electron donor and acceptor moieties may be attached to a single stranded nucleic acid.

      In this embodiment, the single stranded nucleic acids are made for use as probes for a complementary target sequence.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the complementary target sequence is made up of a first target domain and a second target domain, where the first and second sequences are directly adjacent to one another.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the first modified single stranded nucleic acid, which contains only electron donor moieties or electron acceptor moieties but not both, hybridizes to the first target domain, and the second modified single stranded nucleic acid, which contains only the corresponding electron transfer species, binds to the second target domain.
      <br/>
      The relative orientation of the electron transfer species is not important, as outlined in FIG. 2, and the present invention is intended to include all possible orientations.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      In the design of probes comprised of two single stranded nucleic acids which hybridize to adjacent first and second target sequences, several factors should be considered.
      <br/>
      These factors include the distance between the electron donor moiety and the electron acceptor moiety in the hybridized form, and the length of the individual single stranded probes.
      <br/>
      For example, it may be desirable to synthesize only 5' terminally labeled probes.
      <br/>
      In this case, the single stranded nucleic acid which hybridizes to the first sequence may be relatively short, such that the desirable distance between the probes may be accomplished.
      <br/>
      For example, if the optimal distance between the electron transfer moieties is 15 nucleosides, then the first probe may be 15 nucleosides long.

      In one aspect of this embodiment, the two single stranded nucleic acids which have hybridized to the adjacent first and second target domains are ligated together prior to the electron transfer reaction.

      In this embodiment, the first modified single stranded nucleic acid, which contains only electron donor moieties or electron acceptor moieties but not both, hybridizes to the first target domain, and the second modified single stranded nucleic acid, which contains only the corresponding electron transfer species, binds to the second target domain.
      <br/>
      When an intervening single stranded nucleic acid hybridizes to the intervening target sequence, electron transfer between the donor and acceptor is possible.
      <br/>
      The intervening sequence may be any length, and may comprise a single nucleoside.
      <br/>
      Its length, however, should take into consideration the desirable distances between the electron donor and acceptor moieties on the first and second modified nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      Intervening sequences of lengths greater than 14 are desirable, since the intervening sequence is more likely to remain hybridized to form a double stranded nucleic acid if longer intervening sequences are used.

      The presence or absence of an intervening sequence can be used to detect insertions and deletions.

      <br/>
      Thus, an electron donor moiety, after the loss of an electron, may act as an electron acceptor, and vice versa.

      Thus, electron transfer moieties may be sequentially oriented on either strand of the double stranded nucleic acid such that directional transfer of an electron over very long distances may be accomplished.
      <br/>
      For example, a double stranded nucleic acid could contain a single electron donor moiety at one end and electron acceptor moieties, of the same or different composition, throughout the molecule.

      A cascade effect of electron transfer could be accomplished in this manner, which may result in extremely long range transfer of electrons.

      When a long-lived excited state can be prepared on one of the redox sites, direct measurement of the electron transfer rate after photoinduction can be measured, using for example the flash-quench method of Chang et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 113:7057 (1991).

      In a preferred embodiment, initiation of electron transfer is via direct or indirect photoactivation ("light in").
      <br/>
      Simply, electromagnetic radiation of appropriate wavelength strikes the redox molecule on one end of the DNA causing excitation of a donor moiety electron which either decays immediately or is involved in intramolecular electron transfer.
      <br/>
      The efficiency with which electron transfer is induced depends upon the electronic coupling between the electron donor and acceptor and therefore depends on whether the nucleic acid is single or double stranded.
      <br/>
      In addition, the efficiency of electron transfer depends upon the extinction coefficient of the electron donor at the wavelength of light used (higher is better) and upon the lifetime of the donor electron excited state (longer is better).
      <br/>
      Preferred donor complexes therefore include acridine orange, N,N'-dimethyl-2,7-diazapyrenium dichloride (DAP2+), methylviologen, ethidium bromide, quinones such as N,N'-dimethylanthra(2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d'e'f')diisoquinoline dichloride (ADIQ2+); porphyrins (�meso-tetrakis(N-methyl-x-pyridinium)porphyrin tetrachloride�. Transition metal donors and acceptors include complexes of ruthenium, rhenium and osmium (most preferred) where at least one of the ligands is a chromophore.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      Photoactivation can also be used to excite "mediators" that transfer energy to the electron donor moiety on the DNA via an inter-molecular process.
      <br/>
      Such mediators include water soluble and stable complexes of the transition metals, including molybdenum and tungsten halides, trisbipyridyl complexes of rhenium, osmium and ruthenium.
      <br/>
      In addition, other examples include bipyridyl and pyridyl complexes such as Re(bpy)(CO)3 X where X is a halide and Re(py)4 O2. Other examples include transition metal dimers such as �Re2 Cl8 �2- and �Pt2 (P2 O5 H2)4 �4-. Ruthenium trisbypyridine (Ru2+ (bpy)3) is most preferred.

      A potential is applied to a sample containing modified nucleic acid probes either via a direct linkage of the modified nucleic acid to an electrode, or using electron transport mediators.
      <br/>
      Direct linkage can involve a redox active polymer to shuttle electrons from (and to, if the electrode is also used for detection) the electrode.
      <br/>
      Such polymers are outlined below.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the direct connection can involve a relatively poorly conducting linkage provided the linkage is kept reasonably short (less than six sigma bonds).
      <br/>
      Preferred linkages will be three or fewer sigma bonds in length to allow efficient transfer of electrons from the electrode, as is outlined below.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      Indirect electron transfer initiation involves electron transfer mediators or effective diffusional electron donors and acceptors such as water soluble ferrocene/ferricinium, hydroquinones/quinones, reducible and oxidizable components of organic salts, cobaltocenes, the hexa- and octacyanides of molybdenum, tungsten and iron.
      <br/>
      In addition, other examples include macrocycles and chelating ligands of transition metals such as cobalt, ruthenium and nickel, including Co(ethylenediamine)3 and Ru(ethylenediamine)3 and the trisbypyridyl and hexamine complexes of transition metals such as Co, Ru, Fe, and Os.

      Precise control and variations in the applied potential can be via a potentiostat and a three electrode system (one reference, one sample and one counter electrode).
      <br/>
      This allows matching of applied potential to peak electron transfer potential of the system which depends in part on the choice of electron acceptors attached to the nucleic acid.

      Electron transfer through nucleic acid can be detected in a variety of ways.

      A variety of detection methods may be used, including, but not limited to, optical detection, which includes fluorescence, phosphorescence, and refractive index; and electronic detection, including, but not limited to, amperommetry, voltammetry, capacitance and impedence.
      <br/>
      These methods include time or frequency dependent methods based on AC or DC currents, pulsed methods, lock-in techniques, filtering (high pass, low pass, band pass), and time-resolved techniques including time-resolved fluorescence.

      In some embodiments, all that is required is electron transfer detection; in others, the rate of electron transfer may be determined.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      In one embodiment, the efficient transfer of electrons from one end of a nucleic acid double helix to the other results in stereotyped changes in the redox state of both the electron donor and acceptor.
      <br/>
      With many electron transfer moieties including the complexes of ruthenium containing bipyridine, pyridine and imidazole rings, these changes in redox state are associated with changes in spectral properties ("light out").
      <br/>
      Significant differences in absorbance are observed between reduced and oxidized states for these molecules.
      <br/>
      These differences can be monitored using a spectrophotometer or simple photomultiplier tube device.

    <p num="150">
      In this embodiment, possible electron donors and acceptors include all the derivatives listed above for photoactivation or initiation.
      <br/>
      Preferred electron donors and acceptors have characteristically large spectral changes upon oxidation and reduction (large extinction coefficient "deltas") resulting in highly sensitive monitoring of electron transfer.
      <br/>
      Such examples include Ru(NH3)4 py and Ru(bpy)2 im as preferred examples.
      <br/>
      It should be understood that only the donor or acceptor that is being monitored by absorbance need have ideal spectral characteristics.
      <br/>
      That is, the electron acceptor can be optically invisible if only the electron donor is monitored for absorbance changes.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      In a preferred embodiment, the electron transfer is detected fluorometrically.
      <br/>
      Numerous transition metal complexes, including those of ruthenium, have distinct fluorescence properties.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the change in redox state of the electron donors and electron acceptors attached to the nucleic acid can be monitored very sensitively using fluorescence.
      <br/>
      Highly efficient electron transfer through double stranded nucleic acid can, for example, result in the production of fluorescent Ru(4,7-biphenyl2 -phenanthroline)32+ at one end of a nucleic acid probe when the electron transfer moiety on the other end is excited.
      <br/>
      The production of this compound can be easily measured using standard fluorescence assay techniques.
      <br/>
      For example, laser induced fluorescence can be recorded in a standard single cell fluorimeter, a flow through "on-line" fluorimeter (such as those attached to a chromatography system) or a multi-sample "plate-reader" similar to those marketed for 96-well immuno assays.

    <p num="152">
      Alternatively, fluorescence can be measured using fiber optic sensors with nucleic acid probes in solution or attached to the fiber optic.
      <br/>
      Fluorescence is monitored using a photomultiplier tube or other light detection instrument attached to the fiber optic.
      <br/>
      The advantage of this system is the extremely small volumes of sample that can be assayed.

    <p num="153">
      In addition, scanning fluorescence detectors such as the Fluorlmager sold by Molecular Dynamics are ideally suited to monitoring the fluorescence of modified nucleic acid molecules arrayed on solid surfaces.
      <br/>
      The advantage of this system is the large number of electron transfer probes that can be scanned at once using chips covered with thousands of distinct nucleic acid probes.

    <p num="154">
      Many transition metal complexes display fluorescence with large Stokes shifts.

      Suitable examples include bis- and trisphenanthroline complexes and bis- and trisbipyridyl complexes of transition metals such as ruthenium (see Juris, A., Balzani, V., et. al. Coord. Chem. Rev., V. 84, p. 85-277, 1988).
      <br/>
      Preferred examples display efficient fluorescence (reasonably high quantum yields) as well as low reorganization energies.
      <br/>
      These include Ru(4,7-biphenyl2 -phenanthroline)32+ and Ru(4,4'-diphenyl-2,2'-bipyridine)32+.

      Alternatively, a reduction in fluorescence associated with hybridization can be measured using these systems.
      <br/>
      An electron transfer "donor" molecule that fluoresces readily when on single stranded nucleic acid (with an "acceptor" on the other end) will undergo a reduction in fluorescent intensity when complementary nucleic acid binds the probe allowing efficient transfer of the excited state electron.

      This drop in fluorescence can be easily monitored as an indicator of the presence of a target sequence using the same methods as those above.

      In a further embodiment, electrochemiluminescence is used as the basis of the electron transfer detection.

      With some electron transfer moieties such as Ru2+ (bpy)3, direct luminescence accompanies excited state decay.
      <br/>
      Changes in this property are associated with nucleic acid hybridization and can be monitored with a simple photomultiplier tube arrangement (see Blackburn, G. F. Clin. Chem. 37: 1534-1539 (1991); and Juris et al., supra.

      In a preferred embodiment, monitoring electron transfer through nucleic acid is via amperometric detection, either directly using a covalently attached electrode, or indirectly using electron transport "mediators" to shuttle electrons from the nucleic acid to an electrode.

      Modes of attaching nucleic acids to electrodes and possible mediators are described below.
      <br/>
      An amperometric detector would resemble the numerous enzyme-based biosensors currently used to monitor blood glucose, for example.
      <br/>
      This method of detection involves applying a potential (as compared to a separate reference electrode) between the nucleic acid-conjugated electrode and an auxiliary (counter) electrode in the sample containing target genes of interest.
      <br/>
      Electron transfer of differing efficiencies is induced in samples in the presence or absence of target nucleic acid; that is, the single stranded probe exhibits a different rate than the probe hybridized to the target sequence.
      <br/>
      The differing efficiencies of electron transfer result in differing currents being generated in the electrode.

      The device for measuring electron transfer amperometrically involves sensitive (nanoamp to picoamp) current detection and includes a means of controlling the voltage potential, usually a potentiostat.

      Similar sensors are used to monitor electron transfer through nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      In addition, other properties of insulators (such as resistance) and of conductors (such as conductivity, impedance and capacitance) could be used to monitor electron transfer through nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      Finally, any system that generates a current (such as electron transfer) also generates a small magnetic field, which may be monitored in some embodiments.

    <p num="161">
      It should be understood that one benefit of the fast rates of electron transfer observed in the compositions of the invention is that time resolution can greatly enhance the signal-to-noise results of monitors based on absorbance, fluorescence and electronic current.
      <br/>
      The fast rates of electron transfer of the present invention result both in high signals and stereotyped delays between electron transfer initiation and completion.
      <br/>
      By amplifying signals of particular delays, such as through the use of pulsed initiation of electron transfer and "lock-in" amplifiers of detection, between two and four orders of magnitude improvements in signal-to-noise may be achieved.
      <br/>
      This is particularly true using AC methodology, as is more fully described below.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      In a preferred embodiment, electron transfer is initiated and detected using alternating current (AC) methods, particularly when one of the electron transfer moieties is an electrode; that is, when the nucleic acid is attached to an electrode.
      <br/>
      This system is particularly advantageous for a number of reasons.
      <br/>
      In general, the use of AC techniques can result in good signals and low background noise.
      <br/>
      Without being bound by theory, there are a number of possible contributors to background noise, or "parasitic" signals, i.e. detectable signals that are inherent to the system but are not the result of the presence of the target sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      However, all of the contributors to parasitic noise will generally give very fast signals; that is, the rate of electron transfer through the double helix, i.e. the " PI -way", is generally significantly slower than the rate of electron transfer of the parasitic components, such as the contribution of charge carriers in solution, and other "short circuiting" mechanisms.
      <br/>
      As a result, the parasitic components are generally all phase related; that is, they exhibit a constant phase delay or phase shift that will scale directly with frequency.
      <br/>
      The hybridization complex, in contrast, exhibits a time delay between the input and output signals, which is independent of frequency.
      <br/>
      Thus, for the hybridization signal, the time it takes electrons to travel between the electron transfer moieties will remain constant and relatively large as compared to parasitic background.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, at different frequencies, the phase of the system will change.
      <br/>
      This is very similar to the time domain detection used in fluorescent systems.
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      This difference can be exploited in various methods to decrease the signal to noise ratio.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the preferred detection methods comprise applying an AC input signal to a hybridization complex comprising a first single stranded nucleic acid containing an electrode and a second electron transfer moiety and a target single stranded nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      The presence of the target nucleic acid (hybridization complex) is detected via an output signal characteristic of electron transfer through the hybridization complex; that is, the output signal is characteristic of the hybridization complex rather than the parasitic components or single stranded nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, the output signal will exhibit a time delay dependent on the rate of electron transfer between the two electron transfer moieties.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that this time delay will also vary depending on the distance between the electron transfer moieties; the farther apart the electron transfer moieties are, the longer the time delay.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      In a preferred embodiment, the input signals are applied at a plurality of frequencies, since this again allows the distinction between true signal and noise. "Plurality" in this context means at least two, and preferably more, frequencies.
      <br/>
      In general, the AC frequencies will range from about 0.1 Hz to about 10 mHz, with from about 1 Hz to 100 KHz being preferred.

      Preferably, the single stranded nucleic acid containing an electron transfer moiety is attached covalently or in such a way that allows the transfer of electrons from the electrode to the single stranded nucleic acid in order to allow electron transfer between the electron donor and acceptor.
