    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a plasma generating apparatus and a method for controlling plasma-generating high frequency power to be supplied to plasma, for use in a producing process of a thin film component, a particle beam source or an analysis apparatus, and more particularly, to a technique for appropriately and easily control the plasma density.</p>
    <p num="3">(2) Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In recent years, the use of plasma is increased.
      <br/>
      In a producing process of a thin film component, using high-frequency plasma generated by high-frequency power (high-frequency electric power) in a range from a RF frequency band of about 10 MHz to a micro frequency band of 2.45 GHz, etching process or CVD (chemical-vapor deposition) are conducted.
      <br/>
      In such a plasma application technique, it is extremely important for conducting appropriate process to correctly control the plasma density.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The plasma density in a conventional plasma generating apparatus is controlled by controlling plasma-generating high frequency power in the following manner.
      <br/>
      The plasma-generating high frequency power is supplied from a high frequency electric source to plasma through an impedance matching device.
      <br/>
      A portion of the high frequency power that was not absorbed by the plasma and reflected and returned to the high frequency electric source side, i.e., reflected power is detected.
      <br/>
      The matching state of the impedance between the electric source side and the plasma is adjusted by always automatically controlling the impedance matching device such that the reflected power becomes minimum, thereby stabilizing the plasma density to keep the processing condition constant.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      However, there is a problem that the conventional control of the plasma density is not appropriate.
      <br/>
      The plasma density is substantially proportional to net electric power applied to plasma, but even if the impedance matching device is automatically adjusted such that the reflected power of the high frequency power becomes minimum, only high frequency power including loss between the impedance matching device and an ignition electrode (discharge antenna) becomes constant, net electric power applied to the plasma does not always become constant.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is an unavoidable limit in the conventional control method of the plasma density in which the plasma-generating high frequency power is controlled based on the reflection amount of high frequency power that is not absorbed by plasma and reflected and returned.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      To solve the above problem, it is considered that the plasma density is controlled based on the actually measured plasma density.
      <br/>
      In the case of typical plasma comprising monovalent positive ion and electron, the positive ion density and the electron density are substantially equal to each other due to the properties particular to plasma that electrically neutral state is maintained, the electron density is generally called as plasma density.
      <br/>
      That is, the electron density in the plasma is substantially equal to the plasma density.
      <br/>
      Conventionally, as a method for measuring the electron density in plasma, there is an electron beam irradiation type plasma vibration probe which was developed relatively recently, in addition to a Langmuir/probe method and a microwave interference measuring method.
      <br/>
      It can be considered that electron density in plasma is measured by these method, the plasma-generating high frequency power is controlled based on the measured electron density.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The Langmuir/probe method is a method in which a metal probe is directly exposed in plasma an in this state, direct current bias voltage, or direct current bias voltage on which high-frequency voltage is superposed is applied to the metal probe, and based on the current value flowing through at that time, electron density is measured.
      <br/>
      The microwave interference measuring method is a method in which a chamber for generating plasma is provided with windows which are opposed to each other with plasma positioned therebetween, microwave (e.g., single color laser light) is radiated to the plasma through one of the windows, and the microwave ejected from the other window is detected, and electron density is obtained based on phase contrast between the radiated microwave and ejected microwave.
      <br/>
      The electron beam irradiation type plasma vibration method is a method in which a hot filament is placed in a chamber, and based on frequency of plasma oscillations generated when electron beam is irradiated to the plasma from the hot filament, electron density is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      However, the Langmuir/probe method has a problem that the measuring can not be continued for a long time.
      <br/>
      This is because that stains comprising insulative films are adhered on a measured metal probe within a short time, the current value flowing through the metal probe is varied, and accurate measurement can not be continued soon.
      <br/>
      In order to remove the stains adhered on the metal probe surface, a method in which negative bias voltage is applied to the metal probe to carry out sputter-removing method using ion, and a method in which the metal probe is allow to glow to evaporate and remove the stains have been attempted, but the effect is poor, and the problem is not solved by these methods.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Further, the microwave interference measuring method has a problem that the measurement can not be conducted easily.
      <br/>
      This is because a large-scale and expensive apparatus and adjustment of microwave transmission path are necessary, the phase contrast between the radiated microwave and ejected microwave is small and thus, it is difficult to measure precisely.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Furthermore, in the case of the electron beam irradiation type plasma vibration probe method, in addition to anxiety of plasma atmosphere contamination due to tungsten which is evaporated from the hot filament, there is a problem of anxiety of interruption of measurement caused by break of hot filament.
      <br/>
      Especially in the case of plasma using oxygen or chlorofluorocarbons gas, the hot filament is easily cut or broken, and it is necessary to frequently exchange the filament, it can not be said that this is practical.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">In view of the above circumstances, it is an object of the present invention provide a plasma generating apparatus and a control method of plasma-generating high frequency power capable of appropriately and easily controlling plasma density over the long term.</p>
    <p num="13">That is, a method for controlling plasma-generating high frequency power of the present invention comprises the steps of:</p>
    <p num="14">
      supplying, to plasma, high frequency power for measuring plasma density information;
      <br/>
      measuring a physical amount indicating reflection or absorption state of the high frequency power by plasma load;
      <br/>
      obtaining the plasma density information based on a measured result of the physical amount; and
      <br/>
      controlling the plasma-generating high frequency power based on the obtained plasma density information.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      According to the above method of the invention, with respect to the high frequency power for measuring plasma density information to be supplied to plasma apart from high frequency power for generating plasma, the physical amount indicating absorption state by the plasma load is measured, and based on the plasma density information obtained from the measured result of this physical amount, the plasma-generating high frequency power is controlled.
      <br/>
      The plasma-generating high frequency power is controlled in accordance with the plasma density information obtained by a measuring system that is quite different from the supply system of the plasma-generating high frequency power.
      <br/>
      As a result, the monitored result of the actual plasma density excellently reflects the control of the high frequency power, and the plasma density can be controlled appropriately.
      <br/>
      Further, since the high frequency power is supplied to the plasma to obtain the plasma density information in the present invention, even if stains comprising insulative films are adhered to the antenna which supplies the high frequency power, its influence is small, and it is possible to control the plasma-generating high frequency power based on the precise plasma density information.
      <br/>
      Further, for measuring the plasma density information, all that is necessary is only to supply the high frequency power to the plasma, and to measure the physical amount (e.g., to measure reflection amount of high frequency power or the impedance value of the plasma load) indicating the reflection or the absorption state of the high frequency power by the plasma load, the information is measured easily without using hot filament, and the plasma density can easily be controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In the method of the invention, it is preferable that the high frequency power for measuring the plasma density information to the plasma through a dielectric division wall.
      <br/>
      With this structure, since the dielectric division wall exists between the plasma side to be controlled and the supply side of the plasma density information measuring high frequency power, no foreign object enters to the plasma from the supply side of the high frequency power, the plasma can be maintained clean.
      <br/>
      Further, the high frequency power supply side is prevented from being damaged by the plasma.
      <br/>
      Even if the stains comprising insulative films are adhered to the surface of the dielectric division wall, since the insulative films are dielectric, the thickness of the dielectric division wall may be slightly varied, and no substantial variation is not caused in the measuring system, and measuring interference due to the stains of insulative films can be avoided.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In the method of the invention, the physical amount indicative of reflection or absorption state of the high-frequency power by plasma load is measured by measuring an electric current amount of a high-frequency amplifier for supplying high-frequency power.
      <br/>
      For example, the physical amount is measured by measuring the electric current amount of a high frequency power supplying high frequency amplifier.
      <br/>
      Since electric current in accordance with a degree of reflection or absorption of the high frequency power by the plasma load flows through the high frequency power supplying high frequency amplifier, it is possible to easily measure the physical amount indicative of the reflection or the absorption state of the high frequency power by measuring the electric current amount.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In the method of the invention, as the plasma density information, plasma absorption frequency at which strong absorption of high frequency power is caused due to the plasma density is obtained from the measured result of the physical amount for example.
      <br/>
      The plasma absorption frequency is a frequency at a location where a resonant and outstanding absorption is caused as the measured result of the physical amount, the plasma density information correctly corresponding to the actual plasma density is easily obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the method of the invention, it is preferable that the plasma-generating high frequency power is supplied to plasma from a high frequency electric source through an impedance matching system, and the impedance matching system is controlled based on the plasma density information, thereby adjusting the impedance matching state between the electric source side and the plasma side.
      <br/>
      The adjustment of the impedance matching system provides a strong high frequency power control effect (control effect appears easily), the plasma-generating high frequency power can smoothly be controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Further, a plasma generating apparatus of the present invention comprises:
      <br/>
      a plasma generating chamber;
      <br/>
      a plasma generating ignition electrode disposed in the chamber;
      <br/>
      a high frequency electric source for outputting plasma generating high frequency power to be supplied to the ignition electrode;
      <br/>
      plasma density information obtaining means for supplying plasma density information measuring high frequency power in the chamber to measure a physical amount indicating absorption state of high frequency power by plasma load, thereby obtaining the plasma density information; and
      <br/>
      high frequency power control means for controlling the plasma generating high frequency power based on the information obtained by the plasma density information obtaining means.
    </p>
    <p num="21">According to the apparatus of the invention, the plasma-generating high frequency power in accordance with the actual plasma density is controlled, and the plasma density is appropriately and easily controlled over the long term.</p>
    <p num="22">
      In the apparatus of the invention, it is preferable that the plasma density information obtaining means supplies the plasma density information measuring high frequency power to the plasma in the chamber through a dielectric division wall.
      <br/>
      With this structure, the plasma is not contaminated, and the high frequency power supply side is prevented from being damaged by the plasma.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In the apparatus of the invention, said plasma density information obtaining means obtains, as the plasma density information, plasma absorption frequency at which strong absorption of high frequency power is caused due to the plasma density from the measured result of the physical amount.
      <br/>
      According to this example, the plasma-generating high frequency power in accordance with the actual plasma density is correctly controlled, and the plasma density is appropriately and easily controlled over the long term.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In the apparatus of the invention, it is preferable that the high frequency power control means is provided an impedance matching device, the impedance matching device is controlled based on the plasma density information, thereby adjusting the impedance matching state between the electric source side and the plasma side.
      <br/>
      According to this example, the plasma-generating high frequency power in accordance with the actual plasma density is smoothly controlled, and the plasma density is appropriately and extremely easily controlled over the long term.
    </p>
    <p num="25">In the apparatus of the invention, it is preferable that the apparatus further comprises a dielectric tube inserted into the plasma generating chamber and having a closed tip end, an antenna accommodated in the tube at its tip end side for radiating high-frequency power, and a cable accommodated in the tube at its rear side and connected to the antenna for transmitting the high-frequency power, wherein the plasma density information measuring high frequency power is supplied from an antenna in the tube to plasma through a tube wall of the dielectric tube as a dielectric division wall.</p>
    <p num="26">
      With this structure, the plasma density information measuring high frequency power is supplied to the plasma from the antenna through the tube wall (division wall) of the dielectric tube via the cable of the plasma density information measuring probe, and the reflected power received by the antenna is taken out through the cable.
      <br/>
      Further, since the range where the high-frequency power from the antenna influences the plasma is not so wide, it is also possible to obtain a local plasma density information if the amount of the high-frequency power is adjusted.
      <br/>
      That is, by the plasma density information measuring probe, it is possible to easily prepare necessary state for measuring the plasma density information so that the measurement can easily be carried out, and it is possible to allow the spatial resolution to appear.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In the apparatus of the invention, a plurality of antennas are accommodated in the dielectric tube such that distances between a tip end of the tube and the antennas are different from one another, the plasma density information obtaining means obtains plasma absorption frequencies at which strong absorption of high frequency power are caused due to plasma density from the measured result of the physical amount obtained in each of the antennas, and among the plasma absorption frequencies, one having the common frequency is obtained as the plasma surface wave resonance frequency.
      <br/>
      With this structure, among the plasma absorption frequencies obtained for the antennas having difference distances from the tip end of the tube, if one of them having the common frequency is obtained, the plasma surface wave resonance frequency can easily be found.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In the apparatus of the invention, it is preferable that a plasma density information measuring probe is inserted in a chamber which generates plasma for forward and backward movement, and the probe is moved such that a tip end of the probe is pulled backward from a measuring position in the chamber to a retreat position in the vicinity of a wall surface of the chamber when measurement is not carried out.
      <br/>
      With this structure, since the probe is moved such that a tip end of the probe is pulled backward from a measuring position in the chamber to a retreat position in the vicinity of a wall surface of the chamber when measurement is not carried out, even if the plasma allows stains to adhered to the surface of the probe, it is possible to move the probe toward the plasma only when the measurement is carried out, and to prevent the probe from being contaminated.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In the apparatus of the invention, it is preferable that protecting means for blocking excessive plasma generating high-frequency power which enters the antenna in the probe is provided behind the plasma density information measuring probe.
      <br/>
      With this structure, when excessive plasma generating high-frequency power enters the antenna in the probe, the protecting means provided behind prevent the excessive high-frequency power, thereby preventing the apparatus from being destroyed.
      <br/>
      Especially when the generated plasma disappears unexpectedly, there is an adverse possibility that the high-frequency power for generating the plasma is directly placed on the antenna, and the probe control section is destroyed.
      <br/>
      However, this adverse possibility is overcome by the protecting means.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In the apparatus of the invention, it is preferable that the cable for transmitting high-frequency power comprises a conductor tube for a core wire and a shield, and an insulative ceramics material for filling a gap between the core wire and the conductor tube.
      <br/>
      According to this example, since the gap between the core wire and the conductor tube is filled with the heat-resistant insulative ceramics material, the heat-resistance of the cable is enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In the apparatus of the invention, it is preferable that a surface of the dielectric tube is coated with metal such that a measuring area of the dielectric tube is not coated.
      <br/>
      According to this structure, since the surface of the dielectric tube is coated with metal such that the measuring area of the dielectric tube is not coated, the local state of the measuring area that is not coated with metal is strongly reflected to the measured result, and the spatial resolution is enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In the apparatus of the invention, it is preferable that the antenna is extended closely along an inner surface of the dielectric tube.
      <br/>
      With this structure, since the high-frequency power irradiated from the antenna is effectively supplied to the plasma, the supply amount of the high-frequency power may be small, and the measuring precision is enhanced.

      <br/>
      An O-ring 1B is interposed between an outer peripheral surface of the probe 12 and the through hole 1A of the chamber 1 so that vacuum leakage is not caused by placement of the measuring probe 12.

      As shown in FIG. 3, the coaxial cable 16 is of a general coaxial structure in which the fluoroplastic insulative material 16c is interposed between a core wire 16a and a shield wire 16b continuously surrounding the core wire 16a from its outside along the longitudinal direction.

    <p num="51">
      Next, a specific structure of the probe control section 13 will be explained.
      <br/>
      The probe control section 13 comprises a swept-frequency high-frequency oscillator 18, a directional coupler 19, an attenuator 20, and a filter 21.
      <br/>
      These elements are connected to the measuring probe 12 in the order shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The high-frequency oscillator 18 outputs high-frequency power for measuring plasma density information of about 10 mW at frequency of 100 kHz to 3 GHz while automatically conducting swept-frequency.
      <br/>
      The high-frequency power output from the high-frequency oscillator 18 is transmitted to the measuring probe 12 through the directional coupler 19, the attenuator 20, and the filter 21 in this order.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      On the other hand, the high-frequency power for measuring the plasma density information (which will be omitted as "measuring high frequency power" hereinafter) is not always emitted from the loop antenna 15 and absorbed by the plasma load, and some of the high-frequency power is not absorbed by the plasma load and reflected and returned.
      <br/>
      The reflection amount of the high-frequency power which is not absorbed by the plasma load and returned is detected by the directional coupler 19, and sent to a power reflection coefficient frequency characteristic obtaining section 22.
      <br/>
      High-frequency power frequency which is output from the high-frequency oscillator 18 is also sent to the power reflection coefficient frequency characteristic obtaining section 22.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The filter 21 removes high-frequency power for exciting plasma which is mixed into the probe control section 13 through the antenna 15.
      <br/>
      The attenuator 20 adjusts the amount of the measuring high-frequency power to be sent to the measuring probe 12.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      As shown in FIG. 4, the directional coupler 19 is of a coaxial structure comprising a core wire 19a and a shield wire 19b continuously surrounding the core wire 19a from its outside along the longitudinal direction.
      <br/>
      A short coupling line 19c is provided along the core wire 19a inside of the shield wire 19b.
      <br/>
      A side of the coupling line 19c closer to the high-frequency oscillator is grounded through a resistor 19d so that the high-frequency power reflection amount can be detected at the non-grounded side of the coupling line 19c.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The plasma absorption frequency obtaining section 22 obtains counter frequency variation of the measuring high-frequency power reflection coefficient based on the high-frequency power and the detected reflection amount thereof, and based on the obtained result, plasma absorption frequency at which strong absorption of the high frequency power is caused due to the plasma density.
      <br/>
      That is, in the plasma absorption frequency obtaining section 22, expression �detected reflection amount of high-frequency power/total output amount of high-frequency power (constant amount in this embodiment)� is calculated, and the measuring high-frequency reflection coefficient is obtained, and the obtained reflection coefficient is plotted in correspondence with frequency which is varied from moment to moment, so that the counter frequency variation of the measuring high-frequency power reflection coefficient is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      When the reflection coefficient is largely reduced, this point is the absorption peak where strong high-frequency power absorption is caused due to the plasma density, and this absorption peak is plasma absorption frequency.
      <br/>
      The plasma absorption frequency obtaining section 22 detects this absorption peak automatically, and certifies the corresponding frequency as the plasma absorption frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The plasma absorption frequency obtained by the plasma absorption frequency obtaining section 22 is constant correlation with the plasma density, this is effective plasma density information.
      <br/>
      In the case of the system of the embodiment, the plasma absorption frequency is surface wave resonance frequency f. The surface wave resonance frequency f directly corresponds to electron density ne in plasma which is substantially equivalent to plasma density, and this is more effective plasma density information.
    </p>
    <p num="58">Since the concrete measuring method of the plasma density information by this plasma density information obtaining section 11 is a new method that has been invented by the present inventors for the first time, more concrete and detailed measuring example will be explained so that this method can be understood more easily.</p>
    <p num="59">
      Atmosphere of the space S in the chamber 1 was adjusted to be argon 10 m Torr.
      <br/>
      Then, high-frequency power of 13.56 MHz was applied to the ignition electrode 2 from the high-frequency electric source 8 at the output amount of 1.2 kW, thereby generating reactive plasma PM in the space S.

    <p num="60">
      The tube 14 of the measuring probe 12 is a Pyrex glass tube having outer diameter of 6 mm and dielectric constant of 4.
      <br/>
      The coaxial cable 16 is a semi-rigid cable of 50  OMEGA , and the conductor piece 17 is made of aluminum foil.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      First, as shown in FIG. 2, the measuring probe 12 was set such that the length L from the base end of the loop antenna 15 and the tip end of the tube 14 became 3.5 mm. Then, high-frequency power of 10 mW to 3 GHz was output from 100 kHZ the high-frequency oscillator 18 while conducting swept-frequency.
      <br/>
      The reflection amount of the high-frequency power at that time was detected by the directional coupler 19, and the counter frequency variation of a reflection coefficient of high-frequency power shown with the uppermost curved line Ra in FIG. 6 is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 5, the set position of the measuring probe 12 was changed such that the length L from the base end of the loop antenna 15 and the tip end of the tube 14 became 5.5 mm, 7.5 mm, 9.5 mm, 11.5 mm and 13.5 mm. At each of the positions, the counter frequency variation of a reflection coefficient of high-frequency power is obtained in the same manner as that described above.
      <br/>
      The results are as shown with curved lines Rb to Rf in FIG. 6.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The curved lines Ra to Rf show some absorption peaks Pa to Pd indicative of strong absorption of the high-frequency plasma density information at the plasma load side.
      <br/>
      The frequency in the absorption peaks Pa to Pd is plasma absorption frequency.
      <br/>
      It is possible to grasp the characteristics of the generated plasma PM from the plasma absorption frequency.
      <br/>
      However, only the absorption peak Pa of the lowest frequency appears in a position of substantially constant frequency (1.5 GHz) even if the tip end length L is varied as shown in FIG. 7, and the same plasma absorption frequency is measured always.
      <br/>
      The plasma absorption frequency which does not depend of the tip end length L is plasma surface wave resonance frequency f (= OMEGA /2 PI ).
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the case of the system of the embodiment, the plasma absorption frequency obtaining section 22 automatically obtains the lowest frequency of absorption peak as the plasma surface wave resonance frequency f, and sends the same to the mating device control section 10c of the high frequency power control section 9.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The plasma absorption frequency obtaining section 22 may further convert the plasma surface wave resonance frequency f into electron plasma angle frequency  OMEGA p or electron density ne, and may send the same to the matching device control section 10c.
      <br/>
      The plasma surface wave resonance frequency f can easily be converted by the following equation: Electron plasma angle frequency  OMEGA p = OMEGA  *  (1+.di-elect cons.), or electron density ne =.di-elect cons.o * me *  OMEGA p /e (wherein,  OMEGA p : electron plasma angle frequency, .di-elect cons.: dielectric constant of the tube 14, .di-elect cons.o : vacuum dielectric constant, me : electron mass, e: electron amount).
      <br/>
      If the plasma surface wave resonance frequency f is 1.5 GHz, the electron plasma angle frequency  OMEGA p is 2 PI  * 1.5 * 109 *  (1+4)=3.35 * 109, and the electron density ne of plasma PM is 1.4 * 1011 /cm3.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      In the system of the embodiment, it is effective to provide a monitor for showing the plasma surface wave resonance frequency f, the electron plasma angle frequency  OMEGA p and electron density ne.
      <br/>
      The plasma density information can easily be seen visually in real time.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      In the case of the present embodiment, the tube interposed between the plasma PM and the loop antenna 15 as well as the coaxial cable 16 prevents the loop antenna 15 and the coaxial cable 16 from being damaged by plasma PM.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, during the measurement, even if stains comprising insulative films are thinly adhered on the surface of the tube 14, since the insulative film is dielectric, the measuring system is not changed substantially, and variation is not caused in the measured result due to the stains of insulative film.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to continuously monitor the plasma density information over the long term.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Further, this method is carried out only by supplying the high-frequency power from the loop antenna 15 through the tube 14 to grasp the absorption phenomenon of the resonance high-frequency power which is easily measured.
      <br/>
      Therefore, plasma density information can be measured extremely easily.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, hot filament is not used, there is no need to be worry about atmosphere contamination by evaporated tungsten, and it is unnecessary to exchange the hot filament.

    <p num="68">
      Next, a structure of the high frequency power control section 9 will be explained concretely.
      <br/>
      The matching device control section 10c of the high frequency power control section 9 which received the plasma density information from the plasma absorption frequency obtaining section 22 compares the target plasma density held in the plasma density setting section 10b and the plasma density information.
      <br/>
      If the difference therebetween is equal to or greater than a previously set range, the matching device control section 10c applies a variation corresponding to the magnitude of the difference to the impedance matching device 10a, thereby adjusting the impedance matching state between the high frequency electric source 8 side and the plasma PM side.
      <br/>
      That is, in the case of the present invention, the plasma-generating high frequency power is feedback controlled such that the difference between the target plasma density and the actually measured plasma density is eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      In the plasma density setting section 10b, the target plasma density is set and held in the same data type as that of the plasma density information sent from the plasma absorption frequency obtaining section 22.
      <br/>
      That is, if the plasma density information is the plasma surface wave resonance frequency f, the target plasma density is also of the same data type as the plasma surface wave resonance frequency f. If the plasma density information is the electron plasma angle frequency  OMEGA p, the target plasma density is also of the same data type as the electron plasma angle frequency  OMEGA p. If the plasma density information is the electron density ne, the target plasma density is also of the same data type as the electron density ne.

    <p num="91">The present invention should not be limited to the above-described embodiment, and can be modified and carried out as follows:</p>
    <p num="92">
      (1) Although the coaxial cable 16 provided at its tip end with the loop antenna 15 is covered with the dielectric tube 14 to form the measuring probe 12 in the above embodiment, the measuring probe 12 is not necessarily covered with the tube 14.
      <br/>
      That is, it is possible that a coaxial cable is formed at its tip end with the loop antenna 15 or the core wire 16a such that the loop antenna 15 or the core wire 16a projects like a needle, and the coaxial cable is directly inserted to plasma to measure the plasma density.
      <br/>
      In this case, an insulative file may be adhered to the antenna exposed to plasma.
      <br/>
      However, in the present invention, high-frequency power (electromagnetic wave) is radiated from the antenna, there is little possibility that the measurement is influenced by the insulative film adhered to the antenna.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      (2) In the measuring method of the present invention, although plasma absorption frequency other than the plasma surface wave resonance frequency f is also measured, the plasma absorption frequency is also one of plasma density information.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 6, some plasma absorption frequencies (absorption peaks Pb, Pc, Pd) are observed, other than the plasma surface wave resonance frequency f corresponding to the absorption peak Pa.
      <br/>
      It is considered that these other plasma absorption frequencies correspond to so-called Tonks-Dattner.
      <br/>
      That is, when electromagnetic wave is radiated from outside of cylindrical plasma and power absorbed by the plasma is measured, strong absorption is caused at plurality of frequencies around the electron plasma angle frequency  OMEGA p. This phenomenon is cased as Tanks-Dattner resonance from the name of the detector.
      <br/>
      According to subsequent research, it is explained that the mechanism causing this resonance is that electron plasma wave transmitted in radial direction is excited by electromagnetic wave, and resonant absorption is caused when the excited electron plasma wave is reflected at the plasma end and standing wave is generated.
      <br/>
      Further, since there is relationship between the resonance frequency and the electron plasma angle frequency  OMEGA p, if the plasma density is varied, the Tanks-Dattner resonance frequency is also varied.
      <br/>
      That is, the Tanks-Dattner resonance frequency provides plasma density information.

    <p num="96">(5) In another embodiment, the length L from the base end of the loop antenna 15 and the tip end of the tube 14 is arranged to be automatically changed, the plasma absorption frequency obtaining section 22 obtains variations in the counter frequencies of the reflection coefficient of the measuring high frequency power at each of the positions of the loop antenna 15, and compares the absorption peak frequencies in the plurality of measured results, thereby determining the plasma absorption frequency at which strong absorption of high frequency power is caused due to the plasma density.</p>

      In this modification, the power limiter 23 prevents the excessive mixed high-frequency power from flowing into the probe control section, thereby preventing the probe control section from being destroyed.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      A switch (not shown) such as a relay type coaxial switch and a semiconductor type electronic switch may be used instead of the power limiter 23.
      <br/>
      The switch may carry out the on-off operation manually.
      <br/>
      However, in order to prevent the probe control section 13 from being destroyed, it is effective that the switch can detect that the reversely flowing high-frequency exceeds a constant lever (e.g., 1.2 times of supplied high-frequency power), and the switch is automatically turned on or off, or plasma light is monitored by an optical sensor, and when the optical sensor detects that the plasma light disappears, the switch is automatically turned on or off.

      (14) The above embodiment may be modified such that the measuring probe 12 is inserted for forward and backward movement into the chamber in which the plasma PM is generated, and there is provided probe moving means for moving the measuring probe 12 such that the tip end of the measuring probe 12 is pulled backward from the measuring position in the chamber 1 to a position close to the wall surface of the camber 1 when the measuring is not carried out.
      <br/>
      With this modification, even plasma generates stains thickly on the surface of the measuring probe 12, the amount of stains is reduced, and the lifetime of the measuring probe 12 is elongated.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      More specifically, as shown in FIG. 13, the measuring probe 12 is integrally provided with a movable piece 24, the movable piece 24 is threadedly engaged to a sending screw bar 25, and as a motor 26 rotates and the sending screw bar 25 is rotated, the movable piece 24 is reciprocally moved in the longitudinal direction of the measuring probe 12.
      <br/>
      When measuring is not carried out the tip end of the measuring probe 12 is pulled backward to a retreat position in the vicinity of the wall surface of the chamber 1 as shown with a solid line in FIG. 13, and when the measuring is carried out, the motor 26 is controlled such that the tip end of the measuring probe 12 is advanced to a measuring position in the chamber 1 as shown with a dotted line in FIG. 13.

      (15) The insulative material 16c between the core wire 16a and the shield wire 16b of the coaxial cable 16 is fluorocarbon resin in the above embodiment.
      <br/>
      FIG. 14 shows a modification in which an insulative material 16d filling a gap between the core wire 16a and a conductor tube 16e for shield is heat-resistant (insulative) ceramics.
      <br/>
      In this case, the heat-resistance of the coaxial cable 16 is enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      (16) In a measuring probe 12 of another embodiment shown in FIG. 15, a dielectric tube 14 is covered with a metal film 27 such that only a measuring region is not covered with the metal film 27.
      <br/>
      That is, a portion of the metal film 27 corresponding to the measuring region is cut out to form a window 27a.
      <br/>
      The high-frequency power does not enter the metal film 27 and can only enter the window 27a.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a local state of the measuring area that is not coated with the metal film 27 is strongly reflected to the measuring result and as a result, the spatial resolution can be enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      (17) In a measuring probe 12 of another embodiment shown in FIG. 16, the loop antenna 15 is replaced by a wire antenna 15a, and the wire antenna 15a is extended closely along the inner surface of the dielectric tube 14.
      <br/>
      With this structure, there are merits that the high-frequency power is efficiently supplied, and the required high-frequency power can be reduced, and the measuring precision is enhanced.
      <br/>
      Even with the loop antenna 15, if it is extended closely along the inner surface of the dielectric tube 14, the high-frequency power is likewise supplied efficiently.
