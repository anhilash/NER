    <p num="2">The invention relates to radio receivers having the capability of receiving digital television (DTV) signals such as digital high-definition television (HDTV) signals, transmitted using quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) of the principal carrier wave or transmitted using vestigial sideband (VSB) amplitude modulation of the principal carrier wave.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      A Digital Television Standard published Sep. 16, 1995 by the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) specifies vestigial sideband (VSB) signals for transmitting digital television (DTV) signals in 6-MHz-bandwidth television channels such as those currently used in over-the-air broadcasting of National Television System Committee (NTSC) analog television signals within the United States.
      <br/>
      The VSB DTV signal is designed so its spectrum is likely to interleave with the spectrum of a co-channel interfering NTSC analog TV signal.
      <br/>
      This is done by positioning the pilot carrier and the principal amplitude-modulation sideband frequencies of the DTV signal at odd multiples of one-quarter the horizontal scan line rate of the NTSC analog TV signal that fall between the even multiples of one-quarter the horizontal scan line rate of the NTSC analog TV signal, at which even multiples most of the energy of the luminance and chrominance components of a co-channel interfering NTSC analog TV signal will fall.
      <br/>
      The video carrier of an NTSC analog TV signal is offset 1.25 MHz from the lower limit frequency of the television channel.
      <br/>
      The carrier of the DTV signal is offset from such video carrier by 59.75 times the horizontal scan line rate of the NTSC analog TV signal, to place the carrier of the DTV signal about 309,877.6 Hz from the lower limit frequency of the television channel.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the carrier of the DTV signal is about 2,690122.4 Hz from the middle frequency of the television channel.
      <br/>
      The exact symbol rate in the Digital Television Standard is (684/286) times the 4.5 MHz sound carrier offset from video carrier in an NTSC analog TV signal.
      <br/>
      The number of symbols per horizontal scan line in an NTSC analog TV signal is 684, and 286 is the factor by which horizontal scan line rate in an NTSC analog TV signal is multiplied to obtain the 4.5 MHz sound carrier offset from video carrier in an NTSC analog TV signal.
      <br/>
      The symbol rate is 10.762238 million symbols per second, which can be contained in a VSB signal extending 5.381119 MHz from DTV signal carrier.
      <br/>
      That is, the VSB signal can be limited to a band extending 5.690997 MHz from the lower limit frequency of the television channel.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The ATSC standard for digital HDTV signal terrestrial broadcasting in the United States of America is capable of transmitting either of two high-definition television (HDTV) formats with 16:9 aspect ratio.
      <br/>
      One HDTV format uses 1920 samples per scan line and 1080 active horizontal scan lines per 30 Hz frame with 2:1 field interlace.
      <br/>
      The other HDTV format uses 1280 luminance samples per scan line and 720 progressively scanned scan lines of television image per 60 Hz frame.
      <br/>
      The ATSC standard also accommodates the transmission of DTV formats other than HDTV formats, such as the parallel transmission of four television signals having normal definition in comparison to an NTSC analog television signal.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      DTV transmitted by vestigial-sideband (VSB) amplitude modulation (AM) for terrestrial broadcasting in the United States of America comprises a succession of consecutive-in-time data fields each containing 313 consecutive-in-time data segments.
      <br/>
      There are 832 symbols per data segment.
      <br/>
      So, with the symbol rate being 10.76 MHz, each data segment is of 77.3 microseconds duration.
      <br/>
      Each segment of data begins with a line synchronization code group of four symbols having successive values of +S, -S, -S and +S.
      <br/>
      The value +S is one level below the maximum positive data excursion, and the value -S is one level above the maximum negative data excursion.
      <br/>
      The initial line of each data field includes a field synchronization code group that codes a training signal for channel-equalization and multipath suppression procedures.
      <br/>
      The training signal is a 511-sample pseudo-random noise sequence (or "PN-sequence") followed by three 63-sample PN sequences.
      <br/>
      The middle one of these 63-sample PN sequences is transmitted in accordance with a first logic convention in the first line of each odd-numbered data field and in accordance with a second logic convention in the first line of each even-numbered data field, the first and second logic conventions being one's complementary respective to each other.
      <br/>
      The other two 63-sample PN sequences and the 511-sample PN sequence are transmitted in accordance with the same logic convention in all data fields.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The data within data lines are trellis coded using twelve interleaved trellis codes, each a 2/3 rate trellis code with one uncoded bit.
      <br/>
      The data supplied for trellis coding are the result of randomized original data being subjected to Reed-Solomon forward error-correction coding, which provides for correction of burst errors arising from noise sources such as a nearby unshielded automobile ignition system.
      <br/>
      The interleaved trellis codes are transmitted as 8-level (3 bits/symbol) one-dimensional-constellation symbol coding for over-the-air transmission, which transmissions are made without symbol precoding separate from the trellis coding procedure.
      <br/>
      The interleaved trellis codes are transmitted as 16-level (4 bits/symbol) one-dimensional-constellation symbol coding for cablecast, which transmissions are made without precoding.
      <br/>
      The VSB signals have their natural carrier wave, which would vary in amplitude depending on the percentage of modulation, suppressed.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The natural carrier wave is replaced by a pilot carrier wave of fixed amplitude, which amplitude corresponds to a prescribed percentage of modulation.
      <br/>
      This pilot carrier wave of fixed amplitude is generated by introducing a direct component shift into the modulating voltage applied to the balanced modulator generating the amplitude-modulation sidebands that are supplied to the filter supplying the VSB signal as its response.
      <br/>
      If the eight levels of 3-bit symbol coding have normalized values of -7, -5, -3, -1, +1, +3, +5 and +7 in the carrier modulating signal, the pilot carrier has a normalized value of 1.25, the normalized value of +S is +5, and the normalized value of -S is -5.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      VSB signals using 8-level symbol coding will be used in over-the-air broadcasting within the United States, and VSB signals using 16-level symbol coding can be used in over-the-air narrowcasting systems, as may be provided by satellite radio transmissions to dish antennae, or in cable-casting systems.
      <br/>
      However, certain cable-casting is likely to be done using suppressed-carrier quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals instead, rather than using VSB signals.
      <br/>
      This presents television receiver designers with the challenge of designing receivers that are capable of receiving either type of transmission and of automatically selecting suitable receiving apparatus for the type of transmission currently being received.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      It is assumed that the data format supplied for symbol encoding is the same in transmitters for the VSB DTV signals and in transmitters for the QAM DTV signals.
      <br/>
      The VSB DTV signals modulate the amplitude of only one phase of the carrier at symbol rate of 10.76 million symbols per second to provide a real signal unaccompanied by an imaginary signal, which real signal fits within a 6 MHz band because of its VSB nature with carrier near edge of band.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the QAM DTV signals, which modulate two orthogonal phases of the carrier to provide a complex signal comprising a real signal and an imaginary signal as components thereof, are designed to have a symbol rate of 5.38 million symbols per second, which complex signal fits within a 6 MHz band because of its QAM nature with carrier at middle of band.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Processing after symbol decoding is similar in receivers for the VSB DTV signals and in receivers for the QAM DTV signals, assuming the data format supplied for symbol encoding is the same in transmitters for the VSB DTV signals and in transmitters for the QAM DTV signals.
      <br/>
      The data recovered by symbol decoding are supplied as input signal to a data de-interleaver, and the de-interleaved data are supplied to a Reed-Solomon decoder.
      <br/>
      Error-corrected data are supplied to a data de-randomizer which regenerates packets of data for a packet decoder.
      <br/>
      Selected packets are used to reproduce the audio portions of the DTV program, and other selected packets are used to reproduce the video portions of the DTV program.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The zero-intermediate-frequency (ZIF) receivers, which perform amplification and channel selection at baseband, that are used for receiving QAM DTV signals are not well suited for receiving VSB DTV signals.
      <br/>
      This is because of problems with securing adequate adjacent-channel rejection in a ZIF receiver when the carrier is not at the center frequency of the channel.
      <br/>
      The tuners can be quite similar in receivers for the VSB DTV signals and in receivers for the QAM DTV signals if the receivers are of superheterodyne types, however.
      <br/>
      The differences in the receivers reside in the synchrodyning procedures used to translate the final IF signal to baseband and in the symbol decoding procedures.
      <br/>
      A receiver that is capable of receiving either VSB or QAM DTV signals is more economical in design if it does not duplicate the similar tuner circuitry prior to synchrodyning to baseband and the similar receiver elements used after the symbol decoding circuitry.
      <br/>
      The challenge is in optimally constructing the circuitry for synchrodyning to baseband and for symbol decoding to accommodate both DTV transmission standards and in arranging for the automatic selection of the appropriate mode of reception for the DTV transmission currently being received.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      DTV signal radio receivers are known of a type that uses double-conversion in the tuner followed by synchronous detection, having been used during field testing of the HDTV system used during development the ATSC standard.
      <br/>
      A frequency synthesizer generates first local oscillations that are heterodyned with the received VSB DTV signals to generate first intermediate frequencies (e.g., with 920 MHz center frequency and 922.69 MHz carrier).
      <br/>
      A passive LC bandpass filter selects these first intermediate frequencies from their image frequencies for amplification by a first intermediate-frequency amplifier, and the amplified first intermediate frequencies are filtered by a ceramic resonator filter that rejects adjacent channel signals.
      <br/>
      The first intermediate frequencies are heterodyned with second local oscillations to generate second intermediate frequencies (e.g., with 46.69 MHz carrier); and a filter, which can be of surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) type, selects these second intermediate frequencies from their images and from remnant adjacent channel responses for amplification by a second intermediate-frequency amplifier.
      <br/>
      The response of the second intermediate-frequency amplifier is supplied to a third mixer to be synchrodyned to baseband with third local oscillations of fixed frequency.
      <br/>
      The third local oscillations of fixed frequency can be supplied in 0 (degree)  phasing and in 90 (degree)  phasing, thereby implementing separate in-phase and quadrature-phase synchronous detection procedures during synchrodyning.
      <br/>
      Synchrodyning is the procedure of multiplicatively mixing a modulated signal with a wave having a fundamental frequency the same as the carrier of the modulated signal, being locked in frequency and phase thereto, and lowpass filtering the result of the multiplicative mixing to recover the modulating signal at baseband, baseband extending from zero frequency to the highest frequency in the modulating signal.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Separately digitizing in-phase and quadrature-phase synchronous detection results generated in the analog regime presents problems with regard to the synchronous detection results satisfactorily tracking each other after digitizing; quantization noise introduces pronounced phase errors in the complex signal considered as a phasor.
      <br/>
      These problems can be avoided in DTV signal radio receivers of types performing the in-phase and quadrature-phase synchronous detection procedures in the digital regime.
      <br/>
      By way of example, the response of the second intermediate-frequency amplifier is digitized at twice the Nyquist rate of the symbol coding.
      <br/>
      The successive samples are considered to be consecutively numbered in order of their occurrence; and odd samples and even samples are separated from each other to generate respective ones of the in-phase (or real) and quadrature-phase (or imaginary) synchronous detection results.
      <br/>
      Quadrature-phase (or imaginary) synchronous detection takes place after Hilbert transformation of one set of samples using appropriate finite-impulse-response (FIR) digital filtering, and in-phase (or real) synchronous detection of the other set of samples is done after delaying them for a time equal to the latency time of the Hilbert-transformation filter.
      <br/>
      The methods of locking the frequency and phase of synchronous detection and the methods of locking the frequency and phase of symbol decoding have differed in the VSB and QAM DTV receivers.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      These types of known DTV signal radio receiver present some problem in the design of the tuner portion of the receiver because the respective carrier frequencies of VSB DTV signals and of QAM DTV signals are not the same as each other.
      <br/>
      The carrier frequency of a QAM DTV signal is at the middle of a 6-MHz-wide TV channel, but the carrier frequency of a VSB DTV signal nominally is about 310 kHz above the lower limit frequency of the TV channel.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the third local oscillations of fixed frequency, which are used for synchrodyning to baseband, must be of different frequency when synchrodyning VSB DTV signals to baseband than when synchrodyning QAM DTV signals to baseband.
      <br/>
      The 2.69 MHz difference between the two carrier frequencies is larger than that which is readily accommodated by applying automatic frequency and phase control to the third local oscillator.
      <br/>
      A third oscillator that can switchably select between two frequency-stabilizing crystals is a practical necessity.
      <br/>
      In such an arrangement, of course, alterations in the tuner circuitry are involved with arranging for the automatic selection of the appropriate mode of reception for the DTV transmission currently being received.
      <br/>
      The radio-frequency switching that must be done reduces the reliability of the tuner.
      <br/>
      The RF switching and the additional frequency-stabilizing crystal for the third oscillator increase the cost of the tuner appreciably.

      In the QAM/VSB radio receivers described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,506,636 and 5,715,012 the final intermediate-frequency signal is digitized, and synchrodyne procedures to obtain baseband samples are carried out in the digital regime.
      <br/>
      A tuner within the receiver includes elements for selecting one of channels at different locations in a frequency band used for transmitting DTV signals, a succession of mixers for performing a plural conversion of signal received in the selected channel to a final intermediate-frequency (IF) signal, a respective frequency-selective amplifier between each earlier one of the mixers in that succession and each next one of said mixers in that succession, and a respective local oscillator for supplying oscillations to each of the mixers.
      <br/>
      Each of these local oscillators supplies respective oscillations of substantially the same frequency irrespective of whether the selected DTV signal is a QAM signal or is a VSB signal.
      <br/>
      The final IF signal is digitized, and thereafter there are differences in signal processing depending on whether the selected DTV signal is a QAM signal or is a VSB signal.
      <br/>
      These differences are accommodated in digital circuitry including QAM synchrodyning circuitry and VSB synchrodyning circuitry.
      <br/>
      The QAM synchrodyning circuitry generates real and imaginary sample streams of interleaved QAM symbol code, by synchrodyning the digitized final IF signal to baseband providing it is a QAM signal and otherwise processing the digitized final IF signal as if it were a QAM signal to be synchrodyned to baseband.
      <br/>
      The VSB synchrodyning circuitry generates a real sample stream of interleaved VSB symbol code, by synchrodyning the digitized final IF signal to baseband providing it is a VSB signal and otherwise processing the digitized final IF signal as if it were a VSB signal to be synchrodyned to baseband.

      Detection circuitry for sensing the presence of a pilot carrier accompanying a DTV signal of VSB type determines whether or not the final IF signal is a VSB signal to generate a control signal, which is in a first condition when the final IF signal apparently is not a VSB signal and is in a second condition when the final IF signal apparently is a VSB signal.
      <br/>
      Responsive to the control signal being in its first condition, the radio receiver is automatically switched to operate in a QAM signal reception mode; and responsive to the control signal being in its second condition, the radio receiver is automatically switched to operate in a VSB signal reception mode.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="23">
      FIG. 1 shows a tuner 5 comprising elements 11-21 that selects one of channels at different locations in the frequency band for DTV signals and performs plural frequency conversion of the selected channel to a final intermediate-frequency signal in a final intermediate-frequency band.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows a broadcast receiving antenna 6 arranged to capture the DTV signals for the tuner 5.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the tuner 5 can be connected for receiving DTV signals from a narrowcast receiving antenna or from a cablecast transmission system.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      More particularly, in the tuner 5 shown in FIG. 1, a channel selector 10 designed for operation by a human being determines the frequency of first local oscillations that a frequency synthesizer 11, which functions as a first local oscillator, furnishes to a first mixer 12 for heterodyning with DTV signals received from the antenna 6 or an alternative source of such signals.
      <br/>
      The first mixer 12 upconverts the received signals in the selected channel to prescribed first intermediate frequencies (e.g., with 922.69 MHz carrier), and an LC filter 13 is used to reject the unwanted image frequencies that accompany the upconversion result supplied from the first mixer 12.
      <br/>
      The first intermediate-frequency signal resulting from the upconversion, supplied as the filter 13 response, is applied as the input signal to a first intermediate-frequency amplifier 14, which supplies amplified first IF signal for driving a first surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) filter 15 or a filter constructed from ceramic resonators.
      <br/>
      The upconversion to the rather high-frequency first intermediate frequencies facilitates the SAW filter 15 having a large number of poles and zeroes.
      <br/>
      The SAW filter 15 passband is designed to pass those frequencies obtained by converting frequencies extending from the lower limit frequency of the television channel up to about 300 kHz of the upper limit frequency of the television channel.
      <br/>
      Preferably the SAW filter 15 is designed to reject the frequency-modulated sound carrier of any co-channel interfering NTSC analog TV signal.
      <br/>
      Second local oscillations from a second local oscillator 16 are supplied to a second mixer 17 for heterodyning with the response of the first SAW filter 15, to generate second intermediate frequencies (e.g., with 46.69 MHz carrier).
      <br/>
      A second SAW filter 18 is used for rejecting the unwanted image frequencies that accompany the downconversion result supplied from the second mixer 17.
      <br/>
      During the period of transition from NTSC television transmissions to digital television transmissions, the second SAW filter 18 will usually include traps for sound and video carriers of adjacent-channel NTSC television transmissions.
      <br/>
      The second IF signal supplied as the response of the second SAW filter 18 is applied as input signal to a second intermediate-frequency amplifier 19, which generates an amplified second IF signal response to its input signal.
      <br/>
      Oscillations from a third local oscillator 20 are heterodyned with the amplified second IF signal response in a third mixer 21.
      <br/>
      The plural-conversion tuner 5 as thusfar described resembles those previously proposed by others, except that the frequency of the oscillations from the third local oscillator 20 is chosen such that the third mixer 21 supplies a third intermediate-frequency signal response.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      This third IF signal response is the final intermediate-frequency output signal of the tuner 5, which is supplied to a subsequent analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 22 for digitization.
      <br/>
      This final IF signal occupies a frequency band 6 MHz wide, the lowest frequency of which is above zero frequency.
      <br/>
      The lowpass analog filtering of the third mixer 21 response done in the ADC 22 as a preliminary step in analog-to-digital conversion suppresses the image frequencies of the third intermediate frequencies, and the second SAW filter 18 has already restricted the bandwidth of the third intermediate-frequency signals presented to the ADC 22 to be digitized; so the ADC 22 functions as a bandpass analog-to-digital converter.
      <br/>
      The sampling of the lowpass analog filter response in the ADC 22 as the next step in analog-to-digital conversion is done responsive to pulses in a first clock signal supplied from a sample clock generator 23.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The sample clock generator 23 preferably includes a crystal oscillator capable of frequency control over a relatively narrow range for generating cissoidal oscillations at a multiple of symbol rate.
      <br/>
      A symmetrical clipper or limiter generates a square-wave response to these cissoidal oscillations to generate the first clock signal, which the ADC 22 uses to time the sampling of the final IF signal after filtering to limit bandwidth.
      <br/>
      The frequency of the cissoidal oscillations generated by the crystal oscillator in the sample clock generator 23 can be determined by an automatic frequency and phase control (AFPC) signal developed in response to components of the received DTV signal that are subharmonics of symbol or baud rate, for example, as will be described in detail further on in this specification.
      <br/>
      The pulses in the first clock signal recur at a 21.52*106 samples-per-second rate, twice the 10.76*106 symbols-per-second symbol rate for VSB signals and four times the 5.38*106 symbols-per-second symbol rate for QAM signals.
      <br/>
      At this 21.52*106 samples-per-second clock rate, placing the final IF signal so its mid-frequency is above 5.38 MHz reduces the number of 21.52*106 samples-per-second rate samples in the QAM carrier to less than four, which undesirably reduces the uniformity of synchrodyne response supplied for symbol decoding.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The ADC 22 supplies real digital responses of 10-bit or so resolution to the samples of the band-limited final IF signal, which digital responses are converted to complex digital samples by the circuitry 24.
      <br/>
      Various ways to construct the circuitry 24 are known.
      <br/>
      The imaginary digital samples at the QAM carrier frequency may be generated using a Hilbert transformation filter, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,479,449. If the frequency band 6 MHz wide occupied by the final IF signal has a lowest frequency of at least a megaHertz or so, it is possible to keep the number of taps in the Hilbert transformation filter reasonably small and thus keep the latency time of the filter reasonably short.
      <br/>
      Other ways to construct the circuitry 24 described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,548,617 rely on the differential delay between the responses of two infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filters being substantially equal to 90 (degree)  phase shift at all frequencies.
      <br/>
      Still other ways to construct the circuitry 24 rely on the differential delay between the responses of two finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters being substantially equal to 90 (degree)  phase shift at all frequencies.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In the FIG. 1 receiver circuitry the complex digital samples of final IF signal supplied from the circuitry 24 are applied to circuitry 25 for synchrodyning the QAM signal to baseband.
      <br/>
      The circuitry 25 supplies a stream of real samples and a stream of imaginary samples in parallel to a symbol de-interleaver 26, to provide baseband description of the QAM modulating signal.
      <br/>
      The QAM synchrodyning circuitry 25 receives complex-number digital descriptions of two phasings of the QAM carrier, as translated to final intermediate frequency and in quadrature relationship with each other, from read-only memory 27.
      <br/>
      ROM 27, which comprises sine and cosine look-up tables for QAM carrier frequency, is addressed by a first address generator 28.
      <br/>
      The first address generator 28 includes an address counter (not explicitly shown in FIG. 1) for counting the recurrent clock pulses in the first clock signal generated by the sample clock generator 23.
      <br/>
      The resulting address count is augmented by a symbol phase correction term generated by QAM de-rotator correction circuitry, thereby to generate the addressing for the ROM 27.
      <br/>
      The QAM synchrodyne circuitry 25, the first address generator 28, and the operation of each will be explained in greater detail further on in this specification.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In the FIG. 1 receiver circuitry the complex digital samples of final IF signal supplied from the circuitry 24 are also applied to circuitry 30 for synchrodyning the VSB signal to baseband.
      <br/>
      The VSB synchrodyning circuitry 30 supplies streams of samples descriptive of real and imaginary components of the vestigial-sideband modulating signal as synchrodyned to baseband.
      <br/>
      The VSB synchrodyning circuitry 30 receives complex-number digital descriptions of two phasings of the VSB carrier, as translated to final intermediate frequency and in quadrature relationship with each other, from read-only memory 31.
      <br/>
      ROM 31, which comprises sine and cosine look-up tables for VSB carrier frequency, is addressed by a second address generator 32.
      <br/>
      The second address generator 32 includes an address counter (not explicitly shown in FIG. 1) for counting the recurrent clock pulses in the first clock signal generated by the sample clock generator 23.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments of the invention this address counter is the same address counter used by the first address generator 28.
      <br/>
      The resulting address count is augmented by a symbol phase correction term generated by symbol phase correction circuitry, thereby to generate the addressing for the ROM 31.
      <br/>
      The VSB synchrodyne circuitry 30, the second address generator 32, and the operation of each will be explained in greater detail further on in this specification.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      A digital-signal multiplexer 33 functions as a synchrodyne result selector that selects as its response either a first or a second one of two complex digital input signals supplied thereto, the selection being controlled by a detector 34 for detecting average energy in the zero-frequency term of the real samples from the VSB synchrodyne circuitry 30.
      <br/>
      While the QAM signal has components at the VSB signal carrier frequency that can be detected to affect the real samples supplied from the VSB synchrodyne circuitry 30 during QAM signal reception, the phase of those components is random with QAM signal and tends to average over time to a lower energy level than the response to the pilot carrier during VSB signal reception, the phase of the pilot carrier being invariant over time.
      <br/>
      When the digital DTV receiver has its power initially turned on or when a television channel is first tuned to, the detector 34 initially conditions the DTV receiver for VSB reception for a time sufficient for VSB synchrodyne circuitry 30 to synchronously detect whether a pilot carrier is received accompanying a VSB signal transmission.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, when the zero-frequency term has essentially zero average energy, indicating the absence of pilot carrier signal that accompanies a VSB signal, the multiplexer 33 selectively responds to its first complex digital input signal, which is the de-interleaved QAM synchrodyne-to-baseband result supplied from the de-interleaver 26.
      <br/>
      When the zero-frequency term has substantial average energy, indicating the presence of pilot carrier signal that accompanies a VSB signal, the multiplexer 33 selectively responds to its second complex digital input signal comprising the real and imaginary components of the baseband response of the VSB synchrodyne circuitry 30.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The response of the synchrodyne result selection multiplexer 33 is resampled in response to a second clock signal from the sample clock generator 23 in 2:1 decimation circuitry 35, to reduce the sample rate of complex baseband response down to the 10.76 MHz VSB symbol rate, which is twice the 5.38 MHz QAM symbol rate.
      <br/>
      That is, the stream of real digital samples and the stream of imaginary digital samples are both decimated 2:1.
      <br/>
      The 2:1 decimation of the multiplexer 33 response prior to its application as input signal to an amplitude-and-group-delay equalizer 36 reduces the hardware requirements on the equalizer.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, rather than 2:1 decimation circuitry 35 being used after the synchrodyne result selection multiplexer 33, the baseband responses of the QAM synchrodyne circuitry 25 and of the VSB synchrodyne circuitry 30 can each be resampled in response to a second clock signal from the sample clock generator 23 to carry out 2:1 decimation before the synchrodyne result selection multiplexer 33.

      FIG. 2 shows the amplitude-and-group-delay equalizer 36, which converts a baseband response with an amplitude-and-phase-versus-frequency characteristic that tends to cause inter-symbol error to an improved amplitude-versus-frequency characteristic that minimizes the likelihood of inter-symbol error.
      <br/>
      The amplitude-and-group-delay equalizer 36 can be a suitable one of the monolithic ICs available off-the-shelf for use in equalizers.
      <br/>
      Such an IC includes a multiple-tap digital filter used for amplitude-and-group-delay equalization, the tap weights of which filter are programmable; circuitry for selectively accumulating a training signal and temporarily storing the accumulation results; and a microcomputer for calculating updated tap weights of the multiple-tap digital filter used for amplitude-and-group-delay equalization.

      When the DTV signal being received is of VSB type, training signal is contained in the initial data segment of each data field.

      The microcomputer is programmed for comparing the temporarily stored accumulation results with the ideal training signal as known a priori and establishing a set of weighting coefficients for the multiple-tap digital filter used for amplitude-and-group-delay equalization.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, better to compensate for changing multipath conditions such as caused by overflying aircraft, weighting coefficients may be updated on a more frequent basis using decision-directed equalization techniques, such as those disclosed by the inventors and Dr.

      <br/>
      When the DTV signal being received is of QAM type, unless provision is made for inclusion of a training signal, decision-directed equalization techniques have to be used if equalization is to be effected.
      <br/>
      The establishment of a satisfactory set of initial weighting coefficients takes more time than when a training signal is available.
      <br/>
      If the DTV receiver remains in place during periods of operation and non-operation, the time required to establish a satisfactory set of initial weighting coefficients when a DTV channel is retuned can be reduced by if the last determined set of weighting coefficients for that DTV channel have been stored in memory.

      Presuming that the QAM-origin signal contains data synchronizing information corresponding to the data synchronizing information in the VSB-origin signal, one of these symbol-decoded digital data streams is a trellis-decoded digital data stream supplied for further data processing, and another of these symbol-decoded digital data streams is generated by data-slicing without subsequent trellis decoding.

      A 32-state QAM signal provides sufficient capacity for a single HDTV signal, without having to resort to compression techniques outside MPEG standards, but commonly some compression techniques outside MPEG standards are employed to encode the single HDTV signal as a 16-state QAM signal.

      Referring back to FIG. 1, in order that ROMs 27 and 31 can be used to generate digital complex-number descriptions of the QAM and VSB signal carriers as translated to respective final intermediate frequencies, in response to addressing generated by counting first clock signals, provision must be made to lock the one those final intermediate frequencies that is the carrier of the currently received DTV signal to a submultiple of a multiple of the first clock signal frequency.
      <br/>
      That is, those final intermediate frequencies must be in whole number ratios with the first clock signal frequency.
      <br/>
      An automatic phase and frequency control (AFPC) signal is developed in the digital circuitry following the analog-to-digital converter 22 and is used to control the frequency and phase of one of the local oscillators 11, 16 and 20 in the tuner.
      <br/>
      Using a fixed-frequency third local oscillator 20, and controlling the frequency and phase of the oscillations the second local oscillator 16 provides, is preferred in that alignment of the second IF signal with the second SAW filter 18 can be readily assured.
      <br/>
      The second SAW filter 18 usually includes traps for adjacent-channel signal components, in which case proper alignment of the second IF signal between these traps is important for preserving its integrity.
      <br/>
      The symbol clocking is made to exhibit a high degree of frequency stability.
      <br/>
      By locking the carrier of the final intermediate-frequency (IF) signal in frequency and phase to a submultiple of a multiple of the symbol clock frequency, the AFPC for correcting frequency and phase error in the carrier as translated to a final intermediate frequency invariably operates to correct dynamic symbol phase error as well, eliminating the need for a separate phase tracker to correct dynamic symbol phase error.

      FIG. 1 denominates a digital multiplexer 55 as "AFPC selector".
      <br/>
      The multiplexer 55 responds to the pilot carrier presence detector 34 indicating that a pilot carrier is included in the currently received DTV signal for selecting, as an input signal for a digital lowpass filter 56, the imaginary output signal of the baseband response of the VSB synchrodyne circuitry 30.
      <br/>
      The response of lowpass filter 56 is a digital AFPC signal supplied as input signal to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 57. The output signal from the DAC 57 is an analog AFPC signal, which is subjected to further lowpass filtering in an analog lowpass filter 58, the response of which filter 58 is used for controlling the frequency and phase of the oscillations that the second local oscillator 16 provides.
      <br/>
      Analog lowpass filtering is advantageous to use for realizing long-time-constant lowpass filtering because there is reduced need for active devices as compared to digital lowpass filtering.
      <br/>
      Since the shunt capacitor of a resistance-capacitance lowpass filter section can be at the interface between a tuner 5 IC and the IC containing the digital synchrodyning circuitry, the analog lowpass filtering can be done without any cost in IC pin-out.
      <br/>
      Doing some digital lowpass filtering is advantageous, however, since the digital lowpass filter response can be subsampled to the DAC 57; the reduced speed requirements on the digital-to-analog conversion reduces the cost of the DAC 57.

      The multiplexer 55 responds to the pilot carrier presence detector 34 indicating that a pilot carrier is not included in the currently received DTV signal for selecting the input signal for the digital lowpass filter 56 from the circuitry for processing a QAM DTV signal.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows the product output signal of a digital multiplier 29 being provided for such selection.
      <br/>
      The digital multiplier 29 multiplies together the real and imaginary output signals of the QAM synchrodyne circuitry 25 to generate an unfiltered digital AFPC signal.
      <br/>
      The generation of the unfiltered digital AFPC signal is very similar to that in the well-known Costas loop.
      <br/>
      In the Costas loop the AFPC signal is used to control the frequency and phase of the digital local oscillations used for synchrodyning received signals to baseband.
      <br/>
      The FIG. 1 arrangement departs from this procedure, the AFPC signal being used instead to control the frequency and phase of the analog oscillations generated by the second local oscillator 16.
      <br/>
      This regulates the frequency and phase of the final IF signal supplied to the ADC 22 for digitization and for subsequent synchrodyning to baseband in the digital regime.
      <br/>
      As is the case with the Costas loop, the multiplier 29 is preferably of especial design in which the real signal is converted to a ternary signal for multiplying the imaginary signal; this simplifies the digital multiplier and improves the pull-in characteristics of the AFPC loop.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      When the digital DTV receiver has its power initially turned on or when a television channel is first tuned to, the detector 34 initially conditions the DTV receiver for VSB reception, so the multiplexer 55 selects the imaginary output signal of the baseband response of the VSB synchrodyne circuitry 30 for developing AFPC signal for the second local oscillator 16.
      <br/>
      The DTV receiver is initially conditioned for VSB reception for a long enough time for the second local oscillator 16 to be brought into phase lock if a VSB signal is in fact being received, so that synchronous detection of the pilot carrier can be achieved.
      <br/>
      This helps avoid an undesirable lock-out condition in which the DTV signal receiver is conditioned for QAM reception despite a VSB signal in fact being received, in which lock-out condition the second local oscillator 16 receives improper AFPC signal so the VSB synchrodyne circuitry 30 does not synchronously detect the pilot carrier properly so as to detect a non-zero average energy condition.

      The second intermediate-frequency amplifier 19, the third local oscillator 20 (except for its outboard crystal and other frequency selection components), and the third mixer 21 are advantageously constructed within the confines of a monolithic IC; since the output signal of the third mixer 21 is at a different frequency than the input signal to the second IF amplifier 19, the second IF amplifier 19 can have high gain without attendant high risk of unwanted regeneration.
      <br/>
      The first IF amplifier 14, the second local oscillator 16 (except for its outboard crystal and other frequency selection components) and the second mixer 17 can be constructed within the confines of the same IC, or they may be constructed otherwise--e.g., within other integrated circuitry.
      <br/>
      The analog-to-digital converter (ADC), as customary, will be a flash type with at least ten bits resolution and is preferably constructed within the confines of a different monolithic IC than the IF amplifiers.
      <br/>
      The analog lowpass filter at the input of the converter isolates the sampling circuitry, with its associated switching transients, from the IC in which the high-gain second IF amplifier 19 is located (and in some cases, in which the first IF amplifier 14 is also located).
      <br/>
      This reduces the likelihood of unwanted regeneration in the tuner 5.
      <br/>
      Considerable die area is required for the resistance ladder used in establishing the quantizing levels and for the large number of analog comparators involved in an ADC of flash type, so often such an ADC does not share a monolithic IC with other elements anyway.

      The synchrodyning circuits 25 and 30 both receive input signals from the real-to-complex sample converter 24, and portions of their respective address generators 28 and 32 can usually be provided by circuitry shared in common.
      <br/>
      It is advantageous that this single monolithic IC and the circuitry that follows this IC include all the circuitry for automatically selecting the appropriate mode of reception for the DTV transmission currently being received.
      <br/>
      Such practice avoids the need for operating the third local oscillator at two markedly different frequencies, depending on whether a DTV signal is of QAM type or is of VSB type.
      <br/>
      Operation of the third local oscillator at two markedly different frequencies is normally associated with the use of two different crystals for setting those frequencies.
      <br/>
      Operating the third local oscillator at essentially the same frequency, no matter whether the DTV signal is of QAM type or is of VSB type, saves the cost of the extra crystal and of the electronic switching circuitry involved with the use of two crystals.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the reliability of the tuner 5 is improved by the reduction in the amount of circuitry located outside the monolithic integrated circuitry.

      If the ADC is not constructed within an IC, all or substantially all its own, it is advantageous to include it in the IC that contains the circuitry for synchrodyning VSB DTV signals and the circuitry for synchrodyning QAM DTV signals to baseband, since the signals for clocking the sampling of the final IF signal by the ADC are to be generated within that IC.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the analog lowpass filter at the input of the converter still isolates the sampling circuitry, with its associated switching transients, from the IC(s) in which high-gain IF amplification is done.

      Averaging over so many samples can be done by procedures which accumulate lesser numbers of samples and dump them forward at a reduced sample rate for further accumulation, accumulation and subsampling being repeated a few times with progressively lower subsampling rates.

      Transitions of the first clock signal are counted by a second address counter 321 in the second address generator 32 to generate a basic second address signal.

      FIG. 4 shows a clocked digital delay line 323 for delaying the samples from the in-phase synchronous detector 300 by a prescribed number of sample periods prior to their being applied as input signal to a quantizer 324, which supplies the quantization level most closely approximated by the sample currently received by the quantizer 324 as input signal.

      The quantization levels can be inferred from the average energy of the pilot carrier accompanying the VSB signal or can be inferred from the result of envelope detection of the VSB signal.

      The closest quantization level selected by the quantizer 324 as its output signal has the corresponding quantizer 324 input signal subtracted therefrom by a digital adder/subtractor 325, which is operated as a clocked element by including a clocked latch at its output.
      <br/>
      The difference output signal from the adder/subtractor 325 describes the departure of the symbol levels actually recovered from those that should be recovered, but whether the polarity of the departure is attributable to symbol misphasing being leading or lagging remains to be resolved.

      The filter 326 is a finite-impulse-response (FIR) digital filter having a (-1/2), 1, 0, (-1), (+1/2) kernel, the operation of which is clocked by the first sampling clock.

      The prescribed number of sample periods of delay provided by the clocked digital delay line 323 is such that filter 326 response is in temporal alignment with the difference signal from the adder/subtractor 325.

      A digital multiplier 327 multiplies the difference signal from the adder/subtractor 325 by the filter 326 response to resolve this issue.

      The sign bit and the next most significant bit of the two's complement filter 326 response suffice for the multiplication, which permits simplification of the digital multiplier 327 structure.

      The samples of the product signal from the digital multiplier 327 are indications of the misphasing of the symbol clocking done at the receiver that are averaged over many samples (e.g., several million) by a digital lowpass filter 328 for generating the second address correction signal supplied to the adder 322 to correct the basic second address.

A table of subharmonics of successive harmonics of the 10.76 MHz VSB symbol rate, which the sampling clock rate is harmonically related to, is constructed for the frequency ranges of interest.

      Since the frequency band 6 MHz wide occupied by the final IF signal has a lowest frequency of at least a megaHertz or so, it is possible to use as few as seven non-zero-weighted taps in the FIR filter 60 used for Hilbert transformation.

      <br/>
      The Hilbert transform is linear phase in nature so the tap weights of the FIR filter 60 exhibit symmetry about median delay.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a digital adder 67 sums the input signal to delay element 61 and the output signal from the delay element 66 to be weighted in common, a digital adder 68 sums the output signal from the delay element 61 and the output signal from the delay element 65 to be weighted in common, and a digital adder 69 sums the output signal from the delay element 62 and the output signal from the delay element 64 to be weighted in common.

      The output signal from the delay element 64 is applied as input address to a read-only memory 70, which multiplies that signal by an appropriate weight W0 magnitude.

      The sum output signal from the digital adder 69 is applied as input address to a read-only memory 71, which multiplies that signal by an appropriate weight W1 magnitude.

      The use of the ROMs 70, 71, 72 and 73 as fixed-multiplicand multipliers keeps the delay associated with multiplication negligibly short.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the ROMs 70, 71, 72 and 73 are combined by a tree of signed digital adders 74, 75 and 76 operated as adders or subtractors, as required to appropriately assign signs to the magnitudes of the weights W0, W1, W2 and W3 stored in the ROMs 70, 71, 72 and 73.
      <br/>
      The adders 67, 68, 69, 74, 75 and 76 are assumed to be clocked adders each exhibiting one-sample latency, which results in the seven-tap FIR filter 60 exhibiting a six-sample latency.
      <br/>
      Delay of the filter 60 input signal that compensates for this latency is provided by the cascade connection of the six one-sample delay elements 61, 62, 63, 64, 65 and 66.
      <br/>
      The input address to the read-only memory 70 is taken from the output of the delay element 64, rather than from the output of the delay element 63, so the one-sample delay of delay element 64 compensates for the one-sample delays in the adders 67, 68 and 69.

      FIG. 7 shows an alternative form that the circuitry 24 can take, which comprises a pair of all-pass digital filters 80 and 90 of a type described by C. M. Rader and designed based on Jacobian elliptic functions.
      <br/>
      The filters 80 and 90 exhibit a constant  PI /2 difference in phase response for digitized bandpass signals.
      <br/>
      Since oversampled real samples better provide for symbol synchronization when synchrodyning VSB signals, the inventors prefer not to use the all-pass filters also described by Rader that exploit sub-sampling to provide further reductions in the delay network circuitry.

      The construction of the filter 80, which provides the system function H1 (z)=z-1 (z-2 -a2)/(1-a2 z-2), where a2 =0.5846832 in decimal arithmetic, is shown in FIG. 7 to be as follows.
      <br/>
      The samples from the ADC 22 are delayed by one ADC sample clock duration in a clocked delay element 88 for application to a node 89.
      <br/>
      The signal at node 89 is further delayed by two ADC sample clock durations in cascaded clocked delay elements 81 and 82, for application as first summand signal to a digital adder 83.

      The sum output signal of the adder 83 provides the real response from the filter 80.
      <br/>
      The sum output signal of the adder 83 is delayed by two ADC sample clock durations in cascaded clocked delay elements 84 and 85, for application as minuend input signal to a digital subtractor 86 that receives the signal at node 89 as its subtrahend input signal.
      <br/>
      The resulting difference output signal from the digital subtractor 86 is supplied as multiplier input signal to a digital multiplier 87 for multiplying an a2 multiplicand signal, using a binary arithmetic.

      <br/>
      The samples from the ADC 22 are delayed by two ADC sample clock durations in cascaded clocked delay elements 91 and 92, for application as first summand signal to a digital adder 93.
      <br/>
      The sum output signal of the adder 93 provides the imaginary response from the filter 90.

      FIG. 8 shows a complex-signal filter resulting from modifying the FIG. 7 complex-signal filter as follows.
      <br/>
      The position of the clocked delay element 88 is shifted so as to delay the sum output signal of the adder 83, rather than to delay the digital output signal of the ADC 22, and the digital output signal of the ADC 22 is applied to the node 89 without delay, thereby to cause real response to be provided at the output port of the shifted-in-position clocked delay element 88.
      <br/>
      The real response provided at the output port of the shifted-in-position clocked delay element 81 is the same as the response provided at the output port of the clocked delay element 84.
      <br/>
      So, the real response is provided from the output port of the clocked delay element 84 instead of from the output port of the shifted-in-position clocked delay element 81; and the shifted-in-position clocked delay element 81, being no longer required, is dispensed with.

      FIG. 9 shows a complex-signal filter resulting from modifying the FIG. 8 complex-signal filter as follows.

      The first summand signal for the adder 83 is then taken from the cascaded clocked delay elements 91 and 92, rather than from the cascaded clocked delay elements 81 and 82.
      <br/>
      The cascaded clocked delay elements 81 and 82, being no longer required, are dispensed with.
      <br/>
      The FIG. 9 complex-signal filter is preferred over the complex-signal filters of FIGS. 7 and 8 in that redundant clocked delay elements are eliminated.

      FIG. 10 is a detailed block schematic diagram of a complex-signal filter developing a constant  PI /2 difference in phase between a real response Re and an imaginary response Im to the digitized bandpass signals, that is similar the complex-signal filter described by T. F. S. Ng in United Kingdom patent application 2 244 410 A published Nov. 27, 1991 and entitled QUADRATURE DEMODULATOR.
      <br/>
      The Ng filters are finite-impulse-response (FIR) digital filters, rather than IIR filters as described by Rader.
      <br/>
      The FIG. 10 complex-signal filter differs from the filters described by Ng in that 2:1 decimation is done following filtering, rather than before.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      This permits the real and imaginary filtering to be supported by a shared tapped delay line.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 shows this shared tapped delay line composed of cascaded single-clock-delay elements 100-114, such as latches that like the ADC 22 are clocked at four times symbol transmission rate.
      <br/>
      The single-clock-delay element 100 may be dispensed with or subsumed into the ADC 22 in some designs.
      <br/>
      Digital adders and subtractors in the FIG. 6 complex filter are assumed to be clocked at four times symbol transmission rate, with each having a single-clock-duration latency.
      <br/>
      The digital multipliers are assumed to be a wired place shift in the case of a multiplication by an integral power of two or to be provided from read-only memory (ROM), so there is zero latency in each of the multiplications insofar as clocked operation is concerned.
      <br/>
      At least the eight-bit resolution in the filter results per Ng is presumed.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      In order to generate the real response H,(z), the real-response filter is presumed to apply tap weights W0 =4, W1 =0, W2 =-12, W3 =-72, W4 =72, W5 =12, W6 =0 and W7 =-4 per the example described by Ng.
      <br/>
      The real-response filter, in addition to the single-clock-delay elements 100-114, includes a digital subtractor 121 for subtracting the response of the delay element 114 from the response of the delay element 100, a digital multiplier 122 for weighting the differential response of the subtractor 121 by a factor of four, a digital subtractor 125 for subtracting the response of the delay element 103 from the response of the delay element 109, a digital multiplier 126 for weighting the differential response of the subtractor 125 by a factor of twelve, a digital subtractor 127 for subtracting the response of the delay element 105 from the response of the delay element 107, a digital multiplier 128 for weighting the differential response of the subtractor 127 by a factor of seventy-two, a digital adder 129 for summing the products from the digital multipliers 126 and 128, a digital adder 130 for summing the product from the digital multiplier 122 with the sum output signal from the adder 129, and a 2:1 decimator 131 for generating the real filter response Re in decimated response to the sum output signal from the adder 130.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      The subtractor 121 subtracts the response of the delay element 114 from the response of the delay element 100, rather than subtracting the response of the delay element 113 from the output signal of the ADC 22, to introduce single-clock-duration delay to compensate for the latency of the adder 129.
      <br/>
      Since W1 =0 and W6 =0, there is no digital subtractor 123 for subtracting the response of the delay element 111 from the response of the delay element 101 or digital multiplier 124 for weighting the differential response of the subtractor 123.
      <br/>
      Consequently, there is no digital adder for summing product from the multiplier 124 with the product from the multiplier 122.
      <br/>
      This gives rise to the need to compensate for the latency of the adder 129.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      In order to generate the imaginary response H1 (z), the imaginary-response filter is presumed to apply tap weights W8 =8, W9 =14, W10 =22, W11 =96, W12 =22, W13 =14, W14 =8 corrected from the example described by Ng.
      <br/>
      The imaginary-response filter, in addition to the single-clock-delay elements 100-112, includes a digital adder 141 for adding the response of the delay element 112 with the response of the delay element 100, a digital multiplier 142 for weighting the sum response of the adder 141 by a factor of eight, a digital adder 143 for adding the response of the delay element 110 with the response of the delay element 102, a digital multiplier 144 for weighting the sum response of the adder 143 by a factor of fourteen, a digital adder 145 for adding the response of the delay element 108 with the response of the delay element 104, a digital multiplier 146 for weighting the sum response of the adder 145 by a factor of twenty-two, a digital multiplier 147 for weighting the response of the delay element 107 by a factor of ninety-six, a digital adder 148 for summing the products from the digital multipliers 142 and 144, a digital adder 149 for summing the products from the digital multipliers 146 and 147, a digital adder 150 for summing the sum output signals from the adders 148 and 149, and a 2:1 decimator 151 for generating the imaginary filter response Im in decimated response to the sum output signal from the adder 150.
    </p>
    <p num="95">The digital multiplier 147 weights the response of the delay element 107 by a factor of ninety-six, rather than the response of the delay element 106, in order to introduce single-clock-duration delay to compensate for the single-clock-duration latency of each of the adders 141143 and 145.</p>

      Less preferred embodiments of the invention are contemplated in which the trellis-decoded output signals of the two-dimensional symbol decoding circuitry 37 and of the one-dimensional symbol decoding circuitry 38 are supplied to respective data de-interleavers, with data source selection being deferred until data de-interleaving is completed.
      <br/>
      Other less preferred embodiments of the invention are contemplated in which embodiments the trellis-decoded output signal of the two-dimensional symbol decoding circuitry 37 is de-interleaved by a respective data de-interleaver and then decoded by a respective Reed-Solomon decoder to generate a first stream of error-corrected data, in which embodiments the trellis-decoded output signal of the one-dimensional symbol decoding circuitry 38 is de-interleaved by a respective data de-interleaver and then decoded by a respective Reed-Solomon decoder to generate a second stream of error-corrected data, and in which embodiments data source selection is made between the first and second streams of error-corrected data.
      <br/>
      In modifications of these other less preferred embodiments of the invention the first and second streams of error-corrected data are supplied to separate data de-randomizers before data source selection is made.
      <br/>
      In other variants separate Reed-Solomon decoders are used for the QAM and VSB signals, but one data de-interleaver is used for both the QAM and VSB signals, or one data de-randomizer is used for both the first and second streams of error-corrected data.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      The 2:1 decimator 35 of FIG. 1 is replaced by a 4:1 decimator in embodiments of the invention in which the ADC 22 samples at a 43.05*106 samples per second sample rate during digitization, rather than a 21.52*106 samples per second sample rate.
      <br/>
      Such change requires appropriate modifications to the sample clock generator 23, of course.
      <br/>
      A sample rate higher than 21.52*106 samples per second is used when the synchrodyne circuitry 25 or 30 must synchrodyne to baseband a DTV signal having a carrier frequency higher than 5.38 MHz. Such a situation obtains when the synchrodyne circuitry 30 must synchrodyne to baseband a VSB signal having its vestigial sideband at frequencies greater than those in its full sideband.
      <br/>
      Decimators which decimate a baseband signal by a factor N more than two are better designed not to merely omit samples but rather to pre-filter the baseband signal and then to omit samples of the pre-filter response.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The preferred embodiments of the invention described supra use QAM synchrodyning circuitry and VSB synchrodyning circuitry of digital type.
      <br/>
      However, in other embodiments of the invention synchrodyning of the VSB signal to baseband is done using an analog synchronous detector, which is followed by an analog-to-digital converter for digitizing response from the analog synchronous detector to generate a real sample stream of interleaved VSB symbol code.
      <br/>
      In these other embodiments of the invention synchrodyning of the QAM signal to baseband is done using in-phase and quadrature-phase analog synchronous detectors, which are followed by analog-to-digital conversion circuitry for digitizing response from the in-phase analog synchronous detector to generate a real sample stream of interleaved QAM symbol code and for digitizing response from the quadrature-phase analog synchronous detector to generate an imaginary sample stream of interleaved QAM symbol code.
      <br/>
      Digitizing final IF signals rather than baseband signals reduces the number of analog-to-digital conversion procedures that must be done and avoids any problem with tracking the conversion characteristics of two analog-to-digital converters used in the QAM synchrodyning circuitry.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      The detection circuitry for detecting whether said final IF signal is a QAM signal or a VSB signal, in order to generate a control signal, can employ techniques other than the detection of the presence or absence of appreciable average energy at VSB pilot carrier frequency.
      <br/>
      The detection circuitry can use an imaginary sample presence detector for detecting the presence or absence of substantial energy in the imaginary signal output of the VSB synchrodyning circuitry, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,506,636, for example.
      <br/>
      The detection circuitry can use the imaginary sample presence detector alone, or together with a pilot presence detector.
