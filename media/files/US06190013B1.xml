      A projector includes: imaging members producing primary color light images; an illumination optical system for illuminating the imaging members; an image combining optical system for combining the color light images; and a projection optical system for projecting a combined color light image onto a screen.
      <br/>
      The illumination optical system includes a beam splitter for splitting a visible light beam into two components having perpendicular polarization directions; a converter for making the polarization directions of the components coincide; and a color separator for separating light from the converter into rays of the plurality of primary colors.
      <br/>
      The beam splitter can have a first transparent base; a second transparent base; and a polarizing multilayered film placed between the first and second transparent bases.
      <br/>
      The polarizing multilayered film includes high refraction layers each having a refractive index nH and low refraction layers each having a refractive index nL lower than the refractive index nH, the high refraction layers and the low refraction layers being alternately laminated to one another.
      <br/>
      A maximum efficiency incident angle for the polarization splitting film is shifted from an incident angle of a main ray from the light source in order to make an illumination nonuniformity.

      No. 09/109,892, filed Jun. 30, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,967,635 which is based on Japanese patent applications No. 9-178591 and No. 9-194161, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a polarized beam splitter capable of efficiently splitting a polarized beam into S-components and P-components over an entire visible spectrum, and an illumination optical system and a projector provided with such a polarized beam splitter.</p>
    <p num="3">
      A polarized beam splitter splits a plane wave into two components: (S-component and P-component) by reflecting the S-component of the plane wave incident on a polarizing multilayered film at a specified incident angle and causing the P-component thereof to transmit.
      <br/>
      Known polarized beam splitters include a prism type, in which the polarizing multilayered film is held between a pair of prisms, and a plate type, in which an incident angle of the plane wave on the polarizing multilayered film provided on a flat base plate becomes a Brewster angle.

      There have been proposed a variety of apparatuses in which a polarized beam splitter is incorporated as an element in order to utilize the aforementioned polarized light splitting characteristic, i.e. the characteristic of splitting the plane wave into the S-component and P-component, thereby displaying an excellent performance in cooperation of the polarized beam splitter.
      <br/>
      One of such proposed apparatuses is, for example, a liquid crystal projector.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The liquid crystal projector is an equipment for projecting a large image on a screen.
      <br/>
      An image, having a shape similar to that of an image desired to be projected, is formed on a liquid crystal panel; and an illumination light, aligned to a specified polarized light component by an illumination optical system, is produced and projected onto the liquid crystal panel.
      <br/>
      A light emitted from such a liquid crystal panel is introduced to the screen via a projection lens, thereby projecting an enlarged version of the image on the liquid crystal panel onto the screen.
      <br/>
      In other words, in this liquid crystal projector, the illumination optical system is constructed by a light source, the polarized beam splitter, and a half-wave plate, and the light from the light source is split into an S-component and a P-component by being incident on the polarized beam splitter at a specified incident angle.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, only one component, e.g. only the P-component is caused to transmit the half-wave plate, thereby converting it to S-component to produce a light aligned to the S-component.
      <br/>
      This light is projected to the liquid crystal panel as an illumination light.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In order to project a color image onto the screen, it is necessary to prepare liquid crystal panels for each of three primary color components (R(red)-component, G(green)-component and B(blue)-component) and to illuminate the respective liquid crystal panels with corresponding illumination lights.
      <br/>
      To this end, a white light source needs to be used as a light source and a light from the white light source needs to be split into S-component and P-component by the polarized beam splitter over the entire visible spectrum (400 nm to 700 nm).
      <br/>
      Further, this splitting efficiency, i.e. a splitting ratio, is closely related to the intensity of the illumination light to the liquid crystal panel.
      <br/>
      When the splitting ratio decreases, the intensity of the illumination light actually projected on the liquid crystal panel decreases.
      <br/>
      This darkens the image projected onto the screen, with the result that a satisfactory image cannot be obtained.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the polarized beam splitter used in the color liquid crystal projector needs to have a polarized light splitting characteristic of efficiently splitting the incident light into S-component and P-component over the entire visible spectrum.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      An incident angle  THETA  of the light from the white light source on the polarizing multilayered film is normally set at 45 (degree) , and the illumination optical system is designed such that the splitting ratio is at maximum at this incident angle  THETA .
      <br/>
      However, in reality, not only the rays at incident angle  THETA , but also rays displaced from those rays by about  +- 3 (degree)  are incident on the polarizing multilayered film.
      <br/>
      In the conventional polarized beam splitters, no sufficient investigation and consideration are made for such incident rays oblique to those incident at 45 (degree) . If the oblique incident rays are incident on the polarizing multilayered film, the splitting ratio is considerably reduced, causing problems similar to the above.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Further, even if the liquid crystal panel surface is uniformly illuminated, a satisfactory image may not be obtainable due to a nonuniform luminance of an optical image projected onto the screen.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="29">FIG. 1A is a sectional view of a polarized beam splitter according to a first embodiment of the invention, and FIG. 1B is a partial enlarged sectional view of the polarized beam splitter of FIG. 1A. This polarized beam splitter PBS is constructed such that a polarizing multilayered film 3 is held between first and second transparent bases 1, 2 having a refractive index nG as shown in FIG. 1A. This polarizing multilayered film 3 is an alternately laminated film 31 formed by alternately laminating high refraction layers 31H, having a refractive index nH, and low refraction layers 31L, having a refractive index nL lower than nH, as shown in FIG. 1B and satisfying the following inequality:  (Equation image '10' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="30">The meaning of Equation (1) will be described below.</p>
    <p num="31">Assuming that an incident angle of a beam on the alternately laminated film 31 is  THETA  as shown in FIG. 1A, the beam can efficiently be split into an S-component (hereinafter, "S-polarized light") and a P-component (hereinafter, "P-polarized light") when an equality defined by Equation (2) is satisfied:  (Equation image '11' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="32">If  LAMBDA 0 denotes a center wavelength of a wavelength range where the beam can efficiently be split by the alternately laminated film 31 (hereinafter, "splittable wavelength range") and (1+ DELTA g) *  LAMBDA 0, (1- DELTA g) *  LAMBDA 0 denote upper and lower limit wavelengths, respectively, Ag is defined as in Equation (3):  (Equation image '12' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="33">
      In other words, as shown in solid line in FIG. 2, the S-polarized light transmitting through the alternately laminated film 31 is efficiently split in a wavelength range B0 of (1+ DELTA g) *  LAMBDA 0 to (1- DELTA g) *  LAMBDA 0 centered on the center wavelength  LAMBDA 0, i.e., transmittance TP ( THETA ) thereof is proximate to 0%.
      <br/>
      Solid line TP ( THETA ) of FIG. 2 represents transmittance TP of the P-polarized light.
    </p>
    <p num="34">If a beam is incident on the alternately laminated film 31 having the above polarized light splitting characteristic at an incident angle of ( THETA + DELTA ), a center wavelength  LAMBDA + DELTA  is shifted toward a shorter wavelength side as shown in phantom line in FIG. 2 and defined as in Equation (4):  (Equation image '13' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="35">Further, an upper limit wavelength (1+ DELTA g+ DELTA ) *  LAMBDA + DELTA  of a splittable wavelength range B+ DELTA  is defined as in Equation (5).  (Equation image '14' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="36">On the other hand, if a beam is incident on the alternately laminated film 31, having the above polarized light splitting characteristic at an incident angle of ( THETA - DELTA ), a center wavelength  LAMBDA - DELTA  is shifted toward a longer wavelength side as shown in broken line in FIG. 2 and defined as in Equation (6):  (Equation image '15' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="37">Further, a lower limit wavelength (1- DELTA g- DELTA ) *  LAMBDA - DELTA  of the splittable wavelength range B- DELTA  is defined as in Equation (7).  (Equation image '16' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="38">Accordingly, an upper limit wavelength WLmax of a wavelength range BB where the incident beam can efficiently be split into the S-polarized light and P-polarized light for all incident angles, even if the beam is incident on the polarizing multilayered film 3 in an angle range of  +-  DELTA  centering  THETA , is defined as in Equation (8):  (Equation image '17' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="39">whereas a lower limit wavelength WLmin thereof is defined as in Equation (9):  (Equation image '18' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="40">
      Here, the projector is set as usual such that the splitting ratio is at maximum when the incident angle  THETA  of the visible light (400 nm to 700 nm) on the polarizing multilayered film is 45 (degree) . Accordingly, the oblique incidence of rays, shifted by about  +- 3 (degree) , needs to be considered.
      <br/>
      In order to efficiently split the polarized beam under the conditions:
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      upper limit wavelength WLmax =700 nm
      <br/>
      lower limit wavelength WLmin =400 nm
      <br/>
      incident angle  THETA =45 (degree)
      <br/>
      angle of  DELTA =3 (degree) ,
    </p>
    <p num="42">the conditions defined by Equation (10) need to be satisfied.  (Equation image '19' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="43">
      In view of the refractive index of the thin film material usable in the visible spectrum, a relationship between  DELTA g and  DELTA g+ DELTA  can be approximated to:
      <br/>
      DELTA g+3 = DELTA g/0.9.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Further, a relationship between  DELTA g and  DELTA g- DELTA  can be approximated to:
      <br/>
      DELTA g-3 =0.9 *  DELTA g.
    </p>
    <p num="45">By putting these approximated relationships into Equation (10), Equation (11) can be obtained.  (Equation image '20' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="46">
      By satisfying Equation (11), there can be obtained a polarized beam splitter capable of efficiently splitting the polarized beam into the S-polarized light and P-polarized light over the entire visible spectrum (400 nm to 700 nm).
      <br/>
      By solving Equation (11), the inequality defined by Equation (1) can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In other words, by constructing the polarized beam splitter so as to satisfy Equation (1), i.e. to fall within a hatched region of FIG. 3, the polarized beam can efficiently be split into the S-polarized light and P-polarized light over the entire visible spectrum (400 nm to 700 nm) even if the incident beam includes rays incident on the polarized beam splitter at an angle shifted from 45 (degree)  by  +- 3 (degree)  as well as a ray incident thereon at 45 (degree) .
    </p>
    <p num="47">By simplifying Equation (2) by substituting the incident angle  THETA  by 45 (degree) , Equation (12) can be obtained:  (Equation image '21' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="48">
      The splitting efficiency reaches its maximum at the incident angle 45 (degree)  by satisfying Equation (12).
      <br/>
      For example, by setting the refractive indices nG, nH, nL along the respective curves 11, 12, 13, 14 of FIG. 3, the splitting efficiency reaches its maximum at the incident angle  THETA  and the polarized beam can efficiently be split into the S-polarized light and P-polarized light.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      FIG. 4A is a sectional view of a polarized beam splitter according to a second embodiment of the invention, and FIG. 4B is a partial enlarged sectional view of the polarized beam splitter of FIG. 4A. This polarized beam splitter PBS is constructed such that a polarizing multilayered film 3 is held between first and second transparent bases 1, 2 having a refractive index nG as shown in FIG. 4A. In the polarized beam splitter PBS according to the second embodiment, the polarizing multilayered film 3 includes two alternately laminated films 31, 32.
      <br/>
      The respective films 31, 32 are formed similar to that of the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the alternately laminated film 31 is formed by alternately laminating high refraction layers 31H, having a refractive index nH, and low refraction layers 31L, having a refractive index nL lower than nH.
      <br/>
      The alternately laminated film 32 is formed by alternately laminating high refraction layers 32H, having a refractive index nH, and low refraction layers 32L.
    </p>
    <p num="50">Since the polarizing multilayered film 3 thus formed satisfies the following inequality (13):  (Equation image '22' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="51">the polarized beam splitter capable of efficiently splitting the polarized beam into the S-polarized light and P-polarized light over the entire visible spectrum (400 nm to 700 nm) can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="52">
      The meaning of Equation (13) is described below in detail.
      <br/>
      In the polarizing multilayered film 3 of the so-called double layered structure in which two alternately laminated films 31, 32 having an identical structure are put together, the splittable wavelength range thereof can be extended by shifting the splittable wavelength ranges of the respective alternately laminated films 31, 32.
      <br/>
      Specifically, in the case that the center, upper, and lower limit wavelengths of the splittable wavelength range of the alternately laminated film 31 are  LAMBDA 0, (1+ DELTA g) *  LAMBDA 0, and (1- DELTA g) *  LAMBDA 0, respectively, and the center, upper, and lower wavelengths of the splittable wavelength range of the alternately laminated film 32 are K *  LAMBDA 0, K * (1+ DELTA g) *  LAMBDA 0, and K * (1- DELTA g) *  LAMBDA 0, respectively, the upper limit wavelength (1+ DELTA g) *  LAMBDA 0, of the splittable wavelength range of the alternately laminated film 31 and the lower limit wavelength K * (1- DELTA g) *  LAMBDA 0, of the splittable wavelength range of the alternately laminated film 32 are caused to coincide with each other as shown in FIG. 5A. In other words, by satisfying Equation (14), the splittable wavelength range of the polarizing multilayered film 3 can be extended the most.  (Equation image '23' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      However, the splitting efficiency tends to be reduced at the junction wavelength.
      <br/>
      In order to avoid this, the number of high and low refractive layers 31H, 31L forming the polarizing multilayered film 3 needs to be set at a large number.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent a reduction in the splitting efficiency with a reasonable number of layers, it is desirable to set the value of K as defined in Equation (15), so that the splittable wavelength ranges of the alternately laminated films 31, 32 partially overlap each other as shown in FIG. 5B.  (Equation image '24' not included in text)
    </p>

      FIG. 9 is a construction diagram of a liquid crystal projector embodying the invention.
      <br/>
      This liquid crystal projector includes an illumination optical system 100, three liquid crystal panels 23 to 25, a color separation optical system 200, and a projection optical system 300.
      <br/>
      The illumination optical system 100 produces a visible light having an aligned polarization direction.
      <br/>
      The color separation optical system 200 separates the visible light from the illumination optical system 100 into rays of a plurality of primary colors and projects these rays of the respective primary colors on the corresponding liquid crystal panels 23 to 25.
      <br/>
      The projection optical system 300 introduces the rays of the respective color components to a screen while causing the optical axes thereof to coincide with each other, thereby projecting images formed on the liquid crystal panels 23 to 25 onto the screen.
      <br/>
      Respective constructions of the elements will be successively described.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      The illumination optical system 100 is constructed such that visible light in a specified visible spectrum is caused to be incident on the polarized beam splitter PBS by a light source 101, a parabolic mirror 102, and an IR-UV cutoff filter 103.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the light source 101 is a metal halide lamp for irradiating a white beam of randomly polarized light.
      <br/>
      The parabolic mirror 102 has a reflection surface 102a which is a partial surface including a pole of a paraboloid of revolution and has a cross section which is symmetrical with respect to a line.
      <br/>
      The parabolic mirror 102 is adapted to reflect a light irradiated from a focus (the light source 101 is located in this focus position) to the outside (rightward in FIG. 9) of an opening 102b.
      <br/>
      An IR-UV filter 103 is arranged in the vicinity of the opening 102b and is adapted to produce a desired visible light by removing light components within wavelength ranges unnecessary for lights of the three primary colors from the direct light from the light source 101 and the light reflected by the reflection surface 102a.

    <p num="71">
      The thus produced visible light is incident on the first lens array 104 constructing an optical integrator.
      <br/>
      The first lens array 104 includes a plurality of two-dimensionally arranged first lenses 104a and projects the visible light to the polarized beam splitter PBS while dividing it into a plurality of beams.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The polarized beam splitter PBS is, for example, constructed similarly to the one of the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the polarized beam splitter PBS is such that the polarizing multilayered film 3 is formed between a transparent glass (first transparent base) 1 in the form of a triangular prism and a glass plate (second transparent base) 2.
      <br/>
      The splitter PBS is arranged such that the polarizing multilayered film 3 and a rear surface 2a of the glass plate 2 are at 45 (degree)  to the optical axis of the first lens array 104.
      <br/>
      When a plurality of beams split by the first lens array 4 are incident on the polarizing multilayered film 3, they are split into rays of first linearly polarized light components (S-polarized light) 6 and rays of second linearly polarized light components (P-polarized light) 7 whose polarization directions are mutually perpendicular.
      <br/>
      In other words, the first linearly polarized light components of the visible light incident from the first lens array 4 are reflected at right angles by the polarizing multilayered film 3 for the incident angle of 45 (degree) , and emerge as the rays (S-polarized light) 6.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the rear surface 2a of the glass plate 2 spaced from the polarizing multilayered film 3 by a thickness 2b functions as a full reflection surface.
      <br/>
      The second linearly polarized light components of the visible light incident from the first lens array 4 and perpendicular to the first linearly polarized light components are reflected at right angles by the rear surface 2a for the incident angle of 45 (degree)  and emerge as the rays (P-polarized light) 7.
      <br/>
      The thickness 2b is set based on the interval between the rays 6 and 7 (21/2 times the thickness 2b) and the interval between second lenses 10a.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      A second lens array 10 constructing the optical integrator includes the second lenses 10a which are arranged in a two-dimensional manner in the vicinity of a position where the plurality of rays 6, 7 split by the polarized beam splitter PBS converge and are as many as a sum of the rays 6 and 7.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the second lens array 10 has twice as many second lenses 10a as the first lenses 104a of the first lens array 104, i.e., two second lenses 10a adjacent to each other along a vertical direction of FIG. 1 correspond to one first lens 4a.
      <br/>
      On a portion of the emergent surface of the second lens array 10 where the rays 7 emerge, there are mounted half-wave plates 9 for converting the second linearly polarized light components of the rays 7 so as to have the same polarization direction as the first linearly polarized light components of the rays 6.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the visible rays emerging from the second lens array 10 and the half-wave plates 10b have their polarization directions aligned to that of the first linearly polarized light.
    </p>
    <p num="74">The illumination optical system 100 thus constructed can efficiently split the visible beams from the lens array 104 into two linearly polarized rays (S-polarized light and P-polarized light) since the inventive polarized beam splitter is incorporated, and the split rays can efficiently be used to illuminate the liquid crystal panel 23 brightly.</p>

      The color separation optical system 200 for separating the rays into rays of three primary colors to illuminate the corresponding three liquid crystal panels 23 to 25 includes dichroic filters 11, 12.
      <br/>
      The dichroic filter 11 has a cutoff value of a wavelength of 510 nm and is adapted to reflect the rays in the wavelength range of B while transmitting the rays in the wavelength ranges of R and G. A full reflection mirror 13 directs the separated rays in the wavelength range of B toward the liquid crystal panel 23.

      A field lens 14 projects the rays in the wavelength range of B reflected by the full reflection mirror 13 onto the liquid crystal panel 23.

      The dichroic filter 12 has a cutoff value of a wavelength of 580 nm and is adapted to reflect the rays in the wavelength range of G of those having transmitted the dichroic filter 11 while transmitting the rays in the wavelength range of R. A field lens 15 projects the rays in the wavelength range of G separated by the dichroic filter 12 onto the liquid crystal panel 24.

      Lenses 19, 20 and full reflection mirrors 17, 18 construct a relay optical system for introducing the rays in the wavelength range of R having transmitted the dichroic filter 12 to the liquid crystal panel 25 while maintaining their illuminance.

      In the above description, the inventive polarized beam splitter is applied to the liquid crystal projector.

      Since the inventive polarized beam splitter PBS is adopted in either case, the visible beam from the light source 101 can efficiently be split into two linearly polarized lights (S-polarized light and P-polarized light) to efficiently illuminate a specimen brightly.

      FIG. 12 is a diagram showing another embodiment of the liquid crystal projector embodying the invention.

      This liquid crystal projector includes three liquid crystal panels 515 to 517 for forming desired optical images to be enlargedly projected onto a screen, an illumination optical system 100, a dichroic prism (image combination optical system) 526, and a projection optical system 533.
      <br/>
      The illumination optical system 100 produces an illumination light having an aligned polarization direction and illuminates the liquid crystal panels 515 to 517 by separating the illumination light into beams of three primary colors and projecting them to the corresponding liquid crystal panels 515 to 517.
      <br/>
      The dichroic prism 526 combines the optical images on the respective liquid crystal panels 515 to 517 by causing the optical axes of the beams of the respective color components from the liquid crystal panels 515 to 517 to coincide with each other.
      <br/>
      The projection optical system 533 introduces the light from the dichroic prism 526 to the screen, thereby enlargedly projecting an image obtained by combining the images formed on the liquid crystal panels 515 to 517.
      <br/>
      Respective constructions of the elements will be successively described.
    </p>
    <p num="84">In the illumination optical system 100, a light source 501, including a metal halide lamp for emitting a white randomly polarized light, is arranged in one focal point of a parabolic mirror 502, so that the beams of light from the light source 501 are directly directed toward an opening side of the parabolic mirror 502 (to the right side of FIG. 12) and the remaining beams of light are introduced to the opening side of the parabolic mirror 502 after being reflected by a reflecting surface of the parabolic mirror 502.</p>
    <p num="85">
      At the opening side of the parabolic mirror 502 is arranged a first lens array 503 in which a plurality of lenses are arrayed in a two-dimensional manner.
      <br/>
      The randomly polarized light, emitted from the light source 501 as described above, is incident on the first lens array 503 together with the light reflected by the parabolic mirror 503.
      <br/>
      The light is incident on a polarized beam splitter after being split into a plurality of beams.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      In this polarized beam splitter 504, one of the surfaces intersecting at right angles acts as an incident surface of the beams from the first lens array 503 and a polarized light splitting film 505 is formed on an oblique surface 504b.
      <br/>
      A plane-parallel plate 506 is jointed with the polarized light splitting film 505, so that a light transmitted through the polarized light splitting film 505 is fully reflected by a non-joint surface 507 of the plane-parallel plate 506, thereby being returned toward the polarized light splitting film 505.
      <br/>
      Specifically, first linearly polarized light components (S-polarized light components) of the beams perpendicularly incident on the surface 504a of the polarized beam splitter 504 are reflected by the polarized light splitting film 505 and emerge from a surface 504c as rays 508, whereas second linearly polarized light components (P-polarized light components) thereof, transmitted through the polarized light splitting film 505, are fully reflected by the surface 507 of the plane-parallel plate 506, and emerge from the surface 504c as rays 509.

      Accordingly, the rays 508, 509 emerge at equal intervals from the polarized beam splitter 504 by suitably setting the thickness of the plane-parallel plate 506.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      As described above, the polarized beam splitter 504 splits the randomly polarized beam into S-polarized light and P-polarized light.

      The splitting efficiency thereof varies with an incident angle of the beam on the polarized light splitting film 505, and reaches its maximum at a specified incident angle (this incident angle is referred to as "maximum efficiency incident angle" throughout the specification).
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, in order to suppress the luminance nonuniformity in the image on the screen, an incident angle of the main ray of the beam on the polarized light splitting film 505 is slightly shifted from the maximum efficiency incident angle.

      As described above, the beams from the light source divided by the respective lenses of the first lens array 503 form the secondary light source images 512 by being converged in the vicinity of the second lens array 511, and the respective second light source images 512 illuminate the entire surface of the liquid crystal panel 516.
      <br/>
      In other words, the respective lenses of the first lens array 503 are arranged in such positions as to perform a conjugated function with the liquid crystal panel 516.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the optical paths of the rays reaching an A-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 and those reaching a B-side thereof are as shown in solid and broken lines, respectively, in FIG. 13.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      On the other hand, the field lens 524, arranged in the vicinity of the incident side of the liquid crystal panel 516, telecentrically illuminates the liquid crystal panel 516 by making the rays incident thereon while spreading from the secondary light source images 512 in the vicinity of the second lens array 511 into parallel rays.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a focal length of the field lens 524 is set equal to a distance between the second lens array 511 and the field lens 524.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      The rays incident on the A-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 are considered.
      <br/>
      For example, there are rays passing along five optical paths 541 to 545.
      <br/>
      Out of these five rays, only the ray passing along the optical path 543 from the lens 503a on an optical axis 540 is made into a ray parallel to the optical axis 540 by the field lens 524 set as above.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      However, since the energy of the rays influencing the luminance of the image formed on the screen has a distribution centered on the optical axis 540 (see FIG. 13), the rays passing along the optical paths 542, 543 have highest energy among the five rays incident on the A-side of the liquid crystal panel 516, and those passing along the optical paths 541, 544, 545 have successively lower energy in this order.
      <br/>
      In other words, a center 546 of an energy distribution of the rays incident on the A-side does not coincide with the optical path 543, but is located between the optical paths 542 and 543.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the case that the ray on the optical path 543 is made into a ray parallel to the optical axis 540 by the field lens 524, the center 546 of the energy distribution is tilted toward the optical axis 540.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the rays are incident on the dichroic prism 526 while being slightly converged.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      For example, if the energy center 546 of the rays incident on the dichroic prism 526 from the A-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 were converged by an angle  ALPHA , they would be incident on the red and blue reflecting dichroic mirror 527, 528 at 45 (degree) + ALPHA 45 (degree) - ALPHA .
      <br/>
      If the same concept is applied, an energy center 547 of the rays from the B-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 would be incident on the blue and red reflecting dichroic mirrors 527, 528 at 45 (degree) + ALPHA , 45 (degree) - ALPHA  in contrast with the A-side.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      However, the red and blue reflecting dichroic mirrors 527, 528 of the dichroic prism 526 have generally such a characteristic that a wavelength at which transmittance becomes 50% as the incident angle increases (hereinafter, "cutoff wavelength") is shifted to a short wavelength side.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a problem arises in that a range of wavelengths capable of transmitting the dichroic prism 526 differs between the rays from the A-side and those from the B-side.
    </p>
    <p num="104">In order to specifically describe the above problem, it is assumed that the convergence angle  ALPHA  of the energy center of the rays incident on the dichroic prism 526 is 10 (degree)  and the dichroic mirrors 527, 528 have characteristics shown in FIGS. 14A, 14B. The cutoff wavelength of the red reflecting dichroic mirror 527 shown in FIG. 14A is 590 nm at an incident angle of 45 (degree) ; 580 nm at an incident angle of 55 (degree) ; and 600 nm at an incident angle of 35 (degree) . Likewise, the cutoff wavelength of the blue reflecting dichroic mirror 528 shown in FIG. 14B is 500 nm at an incident angle of 45 (degree) ; 490 nm at an incident angle of 55 (degree)  and 510 nm at an incident angle of 35 (degree) .</p>
    <p num="105">
      Accordingly, by combining these dichroic mirrors 527, 528, the rays from the A-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 in a wavelength range of 510 to 580 nm and those from the B-side in a wavelength range of 490 to 600 nm are transmitted by the dichroic prism 526.
      <br/>
      The B-side is brighter because of a wider transmitting wavelength range.
      <br/>
      As a result, a luminance difference is caused in the image formed on the screen via the projection lens 533.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      In order to solve this problem, the liquid crystal panels 515 to 517 are illuminated at different values of illuminance by slightly shifting the incident angles of the rays on the polarized light splitting film 505 from the maximum efficiency incident angle in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      This is designed to make the luminance in the image formed on the screen uniform by canceling the illuminance nonuniformity on the liquid crystal panels 515 to 517 and the influence by the dichroic mirrors 527, 528.
    </p>
    <p num="107">A specific structure of the polarized light splitting film 505 is described with reference to FIG. 15. FIG. 15 is a diagram conceptually showing a conjugated relationship of the screen 534, the liquid crystal panel 516 for green, and the individual lenses of the first lens array 503.</p>
    <p num="108">
      As described above, in FIG. 15 as well, an image A' of the A-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 is dark and an image of the B-side thereof is bright on the screen 534 depending upon the arrangement of the red and blue dichroic mirrors 527, 528 of the dichroic prism 526 in the case that the liquid crystal panel 516 is uniformly illuminated.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the luminance nonuniformity of the image formed on the screen 534 can be reduced or eliminated if the A-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 is made brighter and the B-side thereof is made darker by the illumination optical system 100.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      The lenses of the first lens array 503 are in conjugated relationship with the liquid crystal panel 516.
      <br/>
      If these lenses are represented by the lens 503a on the optical axis 540 and the optical path from this lens 503a to the liquid crystal panel 516 is considered, the A-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 corresponds to an A"-side of the lens 503a and the B-side thereof corresponds to a B"-side of the lens 503a.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      The main ray from the lens 503a is incident on the polarized light splitting film 505 at 45 (degree) . However, the ray on the optical path 552 from A" to A and the ray on the optical path 553 from B" to B are incident on the polarized light splitting film 505 at 45 (degree) + BETA , 45 (degree) - BETA , respectively.
      <br/>
      The angle  BETA  results from the converging angle of the lens 503a (first lens array) and is common among all the lenses constituting the first lens array 503.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      As described above, the rays reaching the A-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 and the rays reaching the B-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 are incident on the polarized light splitting film 505 at different angles.
      <br/>
      However, the splitting efficiency of the polarized light splitting film 505 is also dependent on the incident angle similar to the dichroic mirrors 527, 528, i.e., it decreases substantially symmetrically with respect to the maximum efficiency incident angle.
      <br/>
      FIG. 16 is a graph showing a relationship between the incident angle and the splitting efficiency of the polarized light splitting films 505 constructed such that their maximum efficiency incident angles are 45 (degree)  and 46.9 (degree) , respectively.
      <br/>
      Taking advantage of the incident angle dependency of the splitting efficiency, illuminance nonuniformity can be produced when the liquid crystal panel 516 is illuminated.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      The polarized light splitting film 505 generally includes an alternately laminated film obtained by alternately laminating high refraction layers (refractive index nH) and low refraction layers (refractive index nL), and is held between glass layers (refractive index nG).
      <br/>
      An incident angle  THETA , at which the splitting efficiency of the polarized light splitting film 505 is at maximum, is given by Equation (19):  (Equation image '28' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="113">Accordingly, the polarized light splitting film 505 having a desired maximum efficiency incident angle can be formed by combining suitable materials.</p>
    <p num="114">Referring back to FIG. 15, in this embodiment, it is desired to produce such an illuminance nonuniformity as to make the A-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 brighter than the B-side thereof by increasing the luminance of the ray on the optical path 552 which is incident from A" on the polarized light splitting film 505 at 45 (degree) + BETA  and reaches the point A on the liquid crystal panel 516 as against the luminance of the ray on the optical path 553 which is incident from B" on the polarized light splitting film 505 at 45 (degree) - BETA  and reaches the point B on the liquid crystal panel 516.</p>
    <p num="115">Accordingly, in this embodiment, the polarized light splitting film 505 is formed such that the maximum efficiency incident angle is larger than the incident angle 45 (degree)  of the main ray emerging from the first lens array 503.</p>
    <p num="116">
      Since a shift amount of the maximum efficiency incident angle may depend on not only the focal length of the first lens array 503, but also the dichroic prism 526 and the projection lens 533, it cannot generally be determined.
      <br/>
      As an example, the luminance of the image formed on the screen 534, in the case that the maximum efficiency incident angle of the polarized light splitting film 505 is varied in the liquid crystal projector of the first embodiment, is shown in FIG. 17.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      As seen from FIG. 17, a large luminance nonuniformity caused by the dichroic prism 526 is seen at A'- and B'-sides on the screen 534 in the case that the maximum efficiency incident angle is set at the incident angle 45 (degree)  of the main one of the rays from the first lens array 503.
      <br/>
      As the maximum efficiency incident angle is gradually increased from 45 (degree) , the luminance nonuniformity of the image formed on the screen 534 is reduced.
      <br/>
      When the maximum efficiency incident angle is set at 50.6 (degree) , the luminance nonuniformity is almost completely eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      The illuminance nonuniformity is remarkably improved in the case where the maximum efficiency incident angle is shifted to 50.6 (degree)  as compared with the case where the maximum efficiency incident angle is shifted to 46.9 (degree) . However, in this case, the luminance of the entire screen 534 is reduced.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is desirable to select a suitable value for the shift amount in view of the luminance and the luminance nonuniformity.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      From the results shown in FIG. 17, it is preferable to shift the maximum efficiency incident angle within a range of about 2 (degree)  to 7 (degree)  in the case of the liquid crystal projector having a general construction.
      <br/>
      Particularly, in the case where the maximum efficiency incident angle is shifted by about 3 (degree)  to 5 (degree) , the luminance nonuniformity is almost completely eliminated and the luminance of the entire screen 534 is not considerably reduced.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this range is particularly preferable.

    <p num="120">
      FIG. 18 is a construction diagram of still another liquid crystal projector embodying the invention.
      <br/>
      A big difference between this liquid crystal projector and the one shown in FIG. 12 is that, in the illumination optical system 100, a polarized beam splitter 504' is a flat plate; the arrangement of the parts is changed, and the characteristic of a dichroic filter as a color separation optical system is changed accordingly.
      <br/>
      A detailed description is centered on the differences of the illumination optical system 100 from the embodiment shown in FIG. 12, and no repetitive description is given on the common construction, the elements of which are identified by the same reference numerals.
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      In the illumination optical system 100 according to this embodiment, a parabolic mirror 502, having a light source 501 arranged in one focus position thereof, is arranged so as to open toward the left of FIG. 18, and a first lens array 503 is arranged at this open side.
      <br/>
      Randomly polarized light emitted from the light source 501 and the light reflected by the parabolic mirror 502 are incident on the first lens array 503 and then incident on the polarized beam splitter 504' in the form of a flat plate as a whole after being split into a plurality of beams.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      This polarized beam splitter 504' has one surface 504'a as an incident surface of the beams from the first lens array 503 and the other surface 504'b as an emergent surface and is formed by laminating glass bases 504'c, having a specified thickness, and polarized light splitting films 505' while being inclined by 45 (degree)  with respect to the incident and emergent surfaces 504'a, 504'b.
      <br/>
      Among the beams emerging from the first lens array 503 and perpendicularly incident on the incident surface 504'a, first linearly polarized light components (S-polarized light components), having a property of being reflected by the polarized light splitting films 505', are reflected at 45 (degree)  by the polarized light splitting films 505' inasmuch as being incident thereon at 45 (degree)  and are incident on the adjacent polarized light splitting films 505' at 45 (degree) . These light components are also reflected at 45 (degree)  by the adjacent polarized light splitting films 505' and consequently emerge from the emergent surface 504'b as rays 508'. On the other hand, second linearly polarized light components (P-polarized light components), having a property of being transmitted by the polarized light splitting films 505', transit the polarized light splitting films 505' and emerge from the emergent surface 504' as rays 509'.
    </p>
    <p num="123">As described above, the polarized beam splitter 504' splits the randomly polarized light into the S-polarized light and P-polarized light, and is constructed such that the maximum efficiency incident angle of the polarized light splitting films 505', at which the splitting efficiency is at maximum, is slightly shifted from 45 (degree)  which is an incident angle of a main ray 551' of the rays having emerged from the first lens array 503 and incident on the splitter 504'. This is described in detail later.</p>
    <p num="124">
      A second lens array 511 is arranged in the vicinity of the focus position of the first lens array 503 opposite to the emergent surface 504'b of the thus constructed polarized beam splitter 504', and a plurality of secondary light source images are formed in the vicinity of the individual lenses constructing the second lens array 511.
      <br/>
      On a portion of an incident surface of the second lens array 511 where the rays 509' are incident, there are mounted half-wave plates 510 so as to align the polarization direction of the illumination light emerged from the second lens array 511 to that of the first linearly polarized light (direction of the S-polarized light).
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      The rays from the secondary light source images formed in the vicinity of the second lens array 511 are split into rays in the wavelength range of R and rays in the wavelength ranges of G, B by a dichroic filter 513' for transmitting rays in the wavelength range of R while reflecting the rays in the wavelength ranges of G, B. Thereafter, the rays in the wavelength ranges of G, B are split by a dichroic filter 514 similar to the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      The rays separated in three wavelength ranges of R, G, B are projected to the corresponding liquid crystal panels 515, 516, 517 in parallel with their optical axes by full reflection mirrors 518, 520, 522, lenses 519, 521 and field lenses 523, 524, 525 to illuminate them.
    </p>
    <p num="126">The construction of the polarized light splitting films 505' for reducing or eliminating the luminance nonuniformity in the image formed on the screen 534 of the liquid crystal projector provided with the illumination optical system 100 constructed as above is described below for the rays in the wavelength range of G which has a largest influence on the luminance of the image.</p>
    <p num="127">
      Since this embodiment has the same construction as the one shown in FIG. 12 except the illumination optical system 100, the luminance nonuniformity in the image formed on the screen 534 caused when the liquid crystal panels 515, 516, 517 are uniformly illuminated is the same as in the embodiment shown in FIG. 12. Specifically, an image C' of a C-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 is dark and an image D' of a D-side thereof is bright on the screen 534.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the luminance nonuniformity of the image formed on the screen 534 can be reduced or eliminated if the C-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 is made brighter and the D-side thereof is made darker by the illumination optical system 100.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      If a lens 503b, as one of the lenses constructing the first lens array 503, is taken as an example and an optical path from this lens 503b to the liquid crystal panel 516 is considered, the C-side of the liquid crystal panel 516 corresponds to a C"-side of the lens 503a and the D-side thereof corresponds to a D"-side of the lens 503a.
      <br/>
      If incident angles of the rays passing on these optical paths on the polarized light splitting films 505' are considered, the ray on an optical path 552' from C" to C is incident at 45 (degree) - BETA , and the ray passing on an optical path 553' from D" to D is incident at 45 (degree) + BETA .
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      According to the construction of the second embodiment, the C-side of the liquid crystal panel is made brighter than the D-side thereof by making the maximum efficiency incident angle of the polarized light splitting film 505' smaller than the incident angle 45 (degree)  of the main ray of the beam on the polarized light splitting film 505', thereby producing an illuminance nonuniformity.
      <br/>
      As a result, the luminance of the image formed on the screen 534 is made more uniform or absolutely even.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      FIG. 19 shows the luminance of the image formed on the screen 534 in the case that the maximum efficiency incident angle on the polarized light splitting film 505' is varied in the liquid crystal projector of the second embodiment.
      <br/>
      In this result as well, the luminance of the image formed on the screen 534 is made more uniform as the maximum efficiency incident angle is shifted from 45 (degree) .

      (1) The projection optical system is not limited to the telecentric projection lens, but may, for example, be a nontelecentric projection lens.

      In this case, since the focal length and the like of the projection lens have an influence on the luminance nonuniformity of the image formed on the screen, it is desirable to make the illuminance of the liquid crystal panel nonuniform in view of these factors.

    <p num="133">
      (2) In the foregoing embodiments, the illuminance on the surface of the liquid crystal panel is made nonuniform by shifting the maximum efficiency incident angle on the polarized light splitting film from the incident angle of the main ray from the light source.

      Conversely, a relative displacement may be produced between the maximum efficiency incident angle on the polarized light splitting film and the incident angle of the main ray by shifting the incident angle of the main ray from the light source from the maximum efficiency incident angle, thereby making the illuminance on the surface of the liquid crystal panel nonuniform.

    <p num="134">
      (3) Although the illuminance on the surface of the liquid crystal panel is made nonuniform by shifting the maximum efficiency incident angle on the polarized light splitting film from the incident angle of the main ray from the light source in the foregoing embodiments, the invention is not limited to such a construction.
      <br/>
      For example, the illumination optical system may be provided with a special filter for producing an illuminance nonuniformity.

    <p num="135">(4) The incident angle of the main ray from the light source on the polarized light splitting film is not limited to 45 (degree) , and may be set according to the arrangement of parts in the liquid crystal projector.</p>

      (5) Although the illuminance nonuniformity is produced in all liquid crystal panels by handling the rays in the wavelength range of G, it may be produced in only one or two liquid crystal panels.

      Subsequently, beams within the visible spectrum were caused to be incident at 45 (degree)  and 45 (degree) +3 (degree)  on the polarizing multilayered film of the polarized beam splitter constructed as above, transmittances TS ( THETA - DELTA ), TS ( THETA ), TS ( THETA + DELTA ) of the S-polarized lights incident at the 42 (degree) , 45 (degree) , 48 (degree)  and transmittances TP ( THETA - DELTA ), TP ( THETA , TP ( THETA + DELTA ) of the S-polarized lights incident at the 42 (degree) , 45 (degree) , 48 (degree)  were calculated, respectively.
      <br/>
      The calculation results are shown in a graph of FIG. 20.

    <p num="145">As shown in FIG. 20, the polarized beam can efficiently be split into S-polarized light and P-polarized light over the entire visible spectrum (400 nm to 700 nm) even if the incident beam includes the ray incident at 45 (degree)  and rays obliquely incident with respect to the one incident at 45 (degree)  in a range of  +- 3 (degree) .

      Although a repeat cycle at which the high refraction layers and the low refraction layers are alternately placed is 5, it is not limited to 5.

      Transmittances of the S-polarized light incident on the polarized splitters having different repeating cycles m at 45 (degree)  were calculated, and FIG. 21 is a graph showing the calculation results.
      <br/>
      As is clear from FIG. 21, the polarized light splitting characteristic is improved as the repeat cycle m increases.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is desirable to set the repeat cycle m at 5 or larger.

      As shown in the graph of FIG. 26, even if the incident beam includes the ray incident at 45 (degree)  as well as the rays obliquely incident by  +- 3 (degree)  with respect to the one incident at 45 (degree) , it can efficiently be split into the S-polarized lights and P-polarized lights over the entire visible spectrum (400 nm to 700 nm).

      After the surface of the first transparent base, having a refractive index nG of 1.80, was thoroughly washed, the polarizing multilayered film was formed by successively forming the 1st to 57th layers made of materials shown in TABLE 7 on the surface using a thin film forming method such as a vacuum deposition.

      After the surface of the first transparent base, having a refractive index nG of 1.80, was thoroughly washed, the polarizing multilayered film was formed by successively forming the 1st to 57th layers made of materials shown in TABLE 9 on the surface using a thin film forming method such as a vacuum deposition.

      After an adhesive layer was further formed on the polarizing multilayered film, the polarized beam splitter according to the third embodiment was obtained by adhering the third transparent base (refractive index nG =1.80) to the polarizing multilayered film.
