    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a ferrite oxide magnetic material used as a material for a core of an inductance device and particularly relates to a ferrite oxide magnetic material used as a material for a core of a resin-molded type chip inductor.</p>
    <p num="2">
      To meet the needs of small size, light weight, high accuracy, and so on, in the field of resin-molded type chip inductors, fixed coils, and so on, for which demands have become increased rapidly in recent years in the field of television sets, video recorders, mobile communication machines, and so on, there has been an increased demand for narrow tolerance and high reliability on these parts.
      <br/>
      To meet the demand, a ferrite core material used as a material for magnetic cores of these parts is required to have the following characteristic.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      (1) The material has a low initial magnetic permeability ( MU i) for fine adjustment of inductance due to winding.
      <br/>
      Particularly in the case of a vertically-placed type ferrite core, the initial magnetic permeability needs to be low ( MU i: not higher than 8) so that the fine adjustment can be made by a half turn.
    </p>
    <p num="4">(2) The material has a high sintered density.</p>
    <p num="5">

      That is, the material has an excellent stress-resisting characteristic.

      (4) The material has a characteristic in which the change of inductance is small against both external stress due to a molded resin and external magnetic field applied to the material.

      The ratio of the change of inductance against both external stress and external magnetic field, that is, the ratio of the change of inductance against a load applied to a rod-like sample in parallel with a direction of magnetization and an external magnetic field which are applied and released is hereinafter referred to as stress-resisting and magnetic-field-resisting characteristic.

    <p num="7">
      When a molded inductor device was assembled, the device might be exposed to a magnetic field of high magnetic flux density.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, particularly in the stress-resisting and magnetic-field-resisting characteristic, there was an important question whether initial characteristic could be kept or not when the device was actually put into a final product even in the case where the device per se was adjusted to have a predetermined value of inductance.
      <br/>
      Further, even after the device was actually put into a final product, the chip inductor per se was not shielded magnetically.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it was also necessary to avoid the bad influence of magnetization generated in electromagnetic parts around the chip inductor.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      As an attempt to meet the aforementioned demand, there is known an attempt to improve stress-resisting characteristic by use of ferrite containing basic composition described in JP-A-2-60110 and JP-A-2-137301.
      <br/>
      However, sufficiently high sintered density to be practically satisfactory cannot be achieved when a core material having a low initial magnetic permeability  MU i of not higher than 8 is to be obtained by use of the ferrite material containing such basic composition.
      <br/>
      Reduction of sintered density causes a problem in lowering of stress-resisting characteristic, penetration of a resin or an adhesive agent into pores of a ferrite core, and so on.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, sintered density cannot be reduced.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, when sintered density is to be increased, the initial magnetic permeability is increased to be not smaller than 8.
      <br/>
      In any case, a core material having practically satisfactory characteristic can be hardly obtained.

      If an initial magnetic permeability  MU i of about 6 is to be obtained in such a background-art ferrite core, not only the sintered density becomes low to be 4.6 g/cm3 but also the stress-resisting characteristic becomes large to be -9% (at 1 ton/cm2).

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">An object of the present invention is to provide a ferrite core having a low initial magnetic permeability, a high sintered density, excellent magnetic field-resisting characteristic, excellent stress-resisting characteristic and excellent stress-resisting and magnetic-field-resisting characteristic so that a resin-molded type inductor or fixed coil with both narrow tolerance and high reliability can be achieved.</p>
    <p num="18">According to the present invention, the foregoing object is achieved by the following configuration.</p>
    <p num="19">
      A ferrite oxide magnetic material containing, as basic composition: 11 to 19 mol % of iron oxide calculated in terms of Fe2 O3 ; 11 to 25 mol % of zinc oxide calculated in terms of ZnO; 0 to 10 mol % of copper oxide calculated in terms of CuO; and a residual part of nickel oxide;
      <br/>
      the ferrite oxide magnetic material further containing, as components subsidiary to the basic composition: 0.01 to 15 wt % of lead oxide calculated in terms of PbO; and 0.01 to 15 wt % of silicon oxide and/or talc calculated in terms of SiO2 ;
      <br/>
      the ferrite oxide magnetic material having an initial magnetic permeability of not higher than 8, a sintered density of not lower than 4.8 g/cm3 and a stress-resisting and magnetic-field-resisting characteristic in a range of  +- 5% calculated in terms of the rate  DELTA L/L of the change of inductance due to the condition of a magnetic field of 1000 G under a compressive stress P=5 (kg/mm2) parallel with a direction of magnetization.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Preferably, a ferrite oxide magnetic material further has a magnetic field-resisting characteristic in a range from -4% to 0% calculated in terms of the rate  DELTA L/L of the change of inductance due to the condition of a magnetic field of 1000 G.</p>
    <p num="21">More preferably, a ferrite oxide magnetic material further has a stress-resisting and magnetic-field-resisting characteristic in a range of  +- 3% calculated in terms of the rate  DELTA L/L of the change of inductance due to the condition of a magnetic field of 1000 G under a compressive stress P=5 (kg/mm2) parallel with the direction of magnetization.</p>
    <p num="22">Further, a ferrite oxide magnetic material containing, as the basic composition: 14 to 19 mol % of iron oxide calculated in terms of Fe2 O3 ; 14 to 22 mol % of zinc oxide calculated in terms of ZnO; 0 to 6 mol % of copper oxide calculated in terms of CuO; and a residual part of nickel oxide.</p>
    <p num="23">Furthermore, according to the present invention, it is provided a resin-molded chip inductor having a core made from a ferrite oxide magnetic material as mentioned above.</p>
    <p num="24">
      However, since the chip inductor disclosed in the JP-A-3-91209 contains 25 to 45 mol % of Fe2 O3, the composition range is clearly different from the composition range of iron oxide of from 11 to 19 mol % calculated in terms of Fe2 O3 according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      Further, the oxide magnetic material according to the present invention has a low magnetic permeability and a high density to prevent lowering of strength and has stress-resisting characteristic and magnetic field-resisting characteristic.
      <br/>
      In addition, the oxide magnetic material according to the present invention has an effect of preventing penetration of resin.
      <br/>
      Such characteristic is absent in the chip inductor described in JP-A-3-91209 and is peculiar to the present invention.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="26">There is provided a ferrite oxide magnetic material according to the present invention containing, as basic composition:</p>
    <p num="27">
      11 to 19 mol % of iron oxide calculated in terms of Fe2 O3 ;
      <br/>
      11 to 25 mol % of zinc oxide calculated in terms of ZnO;
      <br/>
      0 to 10 mol % of copper oxide calculated in terms of CuO; and
      <br/>
      a residual part of nickel oxide;
      <br/>
      the ferrite oxide magnetic material further containing, as components subsidiary to the basic composition:
      <br/>
      0.01 to 15 wt % of lead oxide calculated in terms of PbO; and
      <br/>
      0.01 to 15 wt % of silicon oxide and/or talc calculated in terms of SiO2 ;
      <br/>
      the ferrite oxide magnetic material having an initial magnetic permeability of not higher than 8, a sintered density of not lower than 4.8 g/cm3 and a stress-resisting and magnetic-field-resisting characteristic in a range of  +- 5% calculated in terms of the rate  DELTA L/L of the change of inductance due to the condition of a magnetic field of 1000 G under a compressive stress P=5 (kg/mm2) parallel with a direction of magnetization.
      <br/>
      By the aforementioned basic composition, the iron oxide magnetic phase is reduced and the initial magnetic permeability  MU i is reduced critically compared with ferrite having a composition near a stoichiometrical composition.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The iron oxide content in the basic composition is from 11 to 19 mol %, preferably from 14 to 19 mol %, especially from 16 to 19 mol % calculated in terms of Fe2 O3.
      <br/>
      If the iron oxide content is larger than 19 mol %, the stress-resisting and magnetic-field-resisting characteristic is worsened because the density is too high to reduce the initial magnetic permeability.
      <br/>
      In the case where the iron oxide content is not larger than 19 mol %, the iron oxide has to be contained even by a small content.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the lower limit of the iron oxide content is that shown in the aforementioned range.
      <br/>
      If the iron oxide content is reduced, the function of the magnetic material is lowered because the magnetic component in the ferrite core is reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Examples of a divalent metal to be substituted for iron oxide include nickel oxide, zinc oxide, copper oxide, magnesium oxide, and so on.
      <br/>
      Particularly, zinc oxide and nickel oxide are used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The amount of zinc oxide is from 11 to 25 mol %, preferably from 14 to 22 mol %, especially from 16 to 20 mol % calculated in terms of ZnO.
      <br/>
      Nickel oxide is used as the residual part.
      <br/>
      When the amount of zinc oxide to be added is selected to be in the aforementioned range, very excellent stress-resisting and magnetic-field-resisting characteristic is obtained.
      <br/>
      In addition to these metals, copper oxide may be added in an amount of from 0 to 10 mol %, preferably from 0 to 6 mol %, calculated in terms of CuO.
      <br/>
      Although copper oxide is used for controlling the baking temperature, CuOx is generated to cause variations in characteristic if the amount of copper oxide to be added is too large.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The ferrite oxide magnetic material according to the present invention contains as subsidiary components in addition to the aforementioned basic composition:
      <br/>
      0.01 to 15 wt % of lead oxide calculated in terms of PbO; and
      <br/>
      0.01 to 15 wt % of silicon oxide and/or talc calculated in terms of SiO2.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Preferably, the ferrite oxide magnetic material according to the present invention contains as subsidiary components:
      <br/>
      0.1 to 10 wt % of lead oxide calculated in terms of PbO; and
      <br/>
      0.1 to 10 wt % of silicon oxide and/or talc calculated in terms of SiO2.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      By addition of these subsidiary components, stress-resisting characteristic is improved so that the baking temperature range of from about 1100 to about 1300 (degree)  C. adapted for the aforementioned basic composition can be reduced to a range of from about 950 to about 1050 (degree)  C., particularly from about 970 to about 1030 (degree)  C. by a value of from about 100 to about 300 (degree)  C. Accordingly, a good sintered density is preferably obtained at a lower temperature.
      <br/>
      If the amount of the subsidiary components to be added is too small, the effect of a sintering assistant is hardly obtained.
      <br/>
      If the amount of the subsidiary components to be added is larger than 30 wt %, there arises a problem in contamination of furnace materials and sintering tools such as precipitation of glass on a core surface, deposition of cores onto each other, deposition of a core to a setter, and so on.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The ferrite oxide magnetic material according to the present invention has an initial magnetic permeability  MU i of not higher than 8 and has a sintered density of not lower than 4.8 g/cm3. The initial magnetic permeability is preferably not higher than 7, especially not higher than 6.
      <br/>
      The lower limit of the initial magnetic permeability is about 2 though it is not limited specifically.
      <br/>
      The sintered density is preferably not lower than g/cm3, especially not lower than 5.2 g/cm3. The upper limit of the sintered density is about 6 g/cm3 though it is not limited specifically.
      <br/>
      If the initial magnetic permeability is higher than 8, it is difficult to microadjust inductance by winding.
      <br/>
      If the sintered density is lower than 4.8 g/cm3, stress-resisting characteristic is lowered so that there arises such a problem that variations occur in characteristic, a resin or adhesive agent soaks into pores of a core, etc., when the ferrite oxide magnetic material is used as an inductor.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Further, the ferrite oxide magnetic material according to the present invention has a stress-resisting and magnetic-field-resisting characteristic in a range of  +- 5% preferably in a range of  +- 3%, especially in a range of  +- 2% calculated in terms of the ratio  DELTA L/L of the change of inductance due to the condition of application of a DC magnetic field of 1000 G perpendicular to a direction of application of stress under a compressive stress P=5 (kg/mm2) parallel with a direction of magnetization.
      <br/>
      Further, the ferrite oxide magnetic material according to the present invention has a magnetic field-resisting characteristic preferably in a range of from -4% to 0% calculated in terms of the ratio  DELTA L/L of the change of inductance at the time of application of a DC magnetic field -resisting of 1000 G. When the magnetic-field characteristic is in the aforementioned range, the ferrite oxide magnetic material preferably hardly receives a bad influence of the external magnetic field on electromagnetic characteristic.
      <br/>
      Incidentally, the aforementioned DC magnetic field means magnetic field intensity (measured) applied near by a sample at the time of measurement of inductance.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The ferrite oxide magnetic material according to the present invention is molded into a predetermined-shape core material.
      <br/>
      After the core material is wound with a necessary winding coil, the core material is resin-molded.
      <br/>
      Thus, the core material is used as a fixed inductor, a chip inductor, or the like, in various kinds of electronic appliances such as television sets, video recorders, mobile communication appliances, e.g. portable telephones, car telephones, etc., and so on.
      <br/>
      Although the shape of the core is not limited specifically, examples of the core include a drum type core, a toroidal core, an I-shaped core, etc. having an external diameter of not larger than 2 mm and having a length of not larger than 2 mm (for example, 1.8 mm diameter * 1.3 mm length).
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      A resin used as a molding material (coating material) is not limited specifically.
      <br/>
      Examples of the resin include a thermoplastic resin, a thermocurable resin, and so on.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of the resin include a polyolefin resin, a polyester resin, a polyamide resin, a polycarbonate resin, a polyurethane resin, a phenol resin, an urea resin, an epoxy resin, etc.
      <br/>
      Examples of the means for molding the molding material include dipping, coating, spraying, etc. , and further include injection molding, cast molding, etc.

      Fe2 O3 powder, NiO powder, CuO powder, PbO powder and SiO2 powder were prepared as raw materials.

      The raw material powders were mixed so that the final composition had the following composition.
      <br/>
      The mixture was preliminary baked at 900 (degree)  C. for 3 hours and pulverized into preliminary baked ferrite powder.
      <br/>
      After a binder was added to the ferrite powder, the ferrite powder was pressure-molded into a doughnut-like toroidal core having an outer diameter of about 21 mm, an inner diameter of about 12 mm and a height of about 5 mm.
      <br/>
      The toroidal core was baked at a temperature of from 950 to 1200 (degree)  C. for 2 hours to thereby obtain a core sample of a ferrite oxide magnetic material.

      FIG. 1 shows the relation between the initial magnetic permeability  MU i and the sintered density when the amount of Fe2 O3 in the core sample is changed in a range of from 12 to 24 mol %. It is apparent from FIG. 1 that the sintered density of the core sample containing 12 to 24 mol % of Fe2 O3 increases as the Fe2 O3 content decreases, that is, a core sample having a lower initial magnetic permeability can be obtained as the Fe2 O3 content decreases.
      <br/>
      It is supposed this is because the magnetic phase decreases and the non-magnetic phase increases as the Fe2 O3 content decreases.

      It is further apparent that the core sample containing 12 to 24 mol % of Fe2 O3 exhibits a low initial magnetic permeability  MU i with a high density.
