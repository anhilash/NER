    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates in general to the field of optic sensors and more specifically to an optical sensor system and distributed architecture permitting on site sampling of a wide array of analyte samples with information storage and subsequent transfer to remote processing systems.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is described in connection with an optic based sensor system using a diverse collection of lenses, filters, detector and light components and related electronics to detect, qualify and quantify the presence of one or more sample analytes.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Optic-based sensor systems have been developed and used in the fields of chemical, (bio)chemical, biological or biomedical analysis, process control, pollution detection and control as well as others.
      <br/>
      A typical application involves the chemical coating of a thin film, cable or other article followed by excitation and measurement in the presence of a given sample of interest.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The earliest prior art systems combined a wide assortment of lenses, filters, light sources, detector component and electronics.
      <br/>
      One example is the fluorescence-based fiber optic oxygen cable sensor which uses a single high brightness Light Emitting Diode (LED) to produce an excitation signal that catalyzes the emission properties of the fluorescence coating material which interacts with the analyte sample of interest to produce a measurable difference in the emission.
      <br/>
      The material is deposited on a length of the fiber optic cable which, in turn, is emersed in the sample solution producing a measurable change in the fluorescence chemistry emission.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another prior art system uses a prism shaped lens to direct light incoming one surface onto a second surface upon which a sample reagent or binding material has been deposited.
      <br/>
      The second surface is placed in contact with the sample which binds to or otherwise interacts with the reagent to alter the angle of refraction along the prism/sample interface.
      <br/>
      The light output is directed out the third prism surface towards a detector array that senses the angular change indicating one or more sample properties.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      These earlier sensor systems had limited use in most practical field applications.
      <br/>
      The signal generator, LED, lens, filter, detector, amplifier and other components required significant amounts of work space to setup and operate.
      <br/>
      In addition, their overall high cost and immobility confined their use to the laboratory and research environment.
      <br/>
      Moreover, such systems required specialized and routine maintenance to ensure precise alignment of the optics in relation to the light sources, detector components and other sub-systems.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Recent advances in miniaturized low powered light sources and detectors has allowed the design of compact fully integrated sensors.
      <br/>
      A main feature of these miniaturized sensors is the fixed positioning of the light source, sampling surface and detector elements within a rigid solid housing.
      <br/>
      Thus, miniaturized sensors eliminate the need to transport the sample to the sensor sampling surface.
      <br/>
      Because the components are readily available the miniaturized sensors are easier to maintain and less expensive to manufacture.
      <br/>
      Also, since the optics are fixed, miniaturized sensors do not exhibit the same alignment problems of the bulkier prior art sensor systems.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Until the present invention, however, the use of the miniaturized integrated sensors in application specific hand held instruments has not been contemplated.
      <br/>
      A device that communicates with one or more sensors which are in close proximity or contact with the sample would permit distributed monitoring of environmental conditions and provide great utility.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      A distributed sensor system incorporating miniaturized sensor technology wherein the optics are fixed in a self-contained housing or device platform has not been contemplated.
      <br/>
      Prior art sensing systems are too bulky and expensive for use on an in-situ basis.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      As such, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a miniaturized integrated (bio)chemical sensing system that allows field personnel to collect sample data in-situ, process, analyze, store the data, and transfer it to a local or centralized server for further analysis.
      <br/>
      The system includes a fixed optic sensor which can be drop placed in the field or throughout a facility and monitored from an electronic sub-assembly that communicates with the sensor to receive the sample data and control the sensor's operations.
      <br/>
      Multiple sensors can be monitored by using a sensor specific identifying tag which provides a location mark specific identity for each sensor.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Another object of the invention is to provide a distributed sensor architecture wherein sample data from a plurality of separate and disparate locations is transferred from the local field processors to a centralized processing system.
      <br/>
      The architecture defines a sensor system with widespread application such as in toxic waste, medical onsite diagnosis or military uses.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a sensor system that can be used as an on-site medical diagnostic tool by medical field personnel.
      <br/>
      In this regard, a device capable of resolving various cardiac markers quickly is envisioned.
      <br/>
      A blood sample is placed in contact with a sensor/sample interface which has a plurality of binding ligands thereon causing binding interactions between the ligands and specific cardiac markers.
      <br/>
      The interaction data is relayed to a local processor for analysis and onsite diagnosis which, in turn, is relayed to centralized processor for patient tracking and/or billing purposes.
      <br/>
      The field medical personnel can receive on-site diagnosis via an integrated display from either the local processing system or the centralized processor and continue treatment accordingly.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Disclosed in one embodiment, is an optical sensor system with a sensor sub-system having at least one light source, one sensor/sample surface and one detector interfaced in fixed relation to one another and an electronic sub-system that communications with the sensor sub-system to obtain sample related data.
      <br/>
      The electronic sub-system includes a signal processing means, a microcontroller, a storage area, a display, a user interface and controls.
      <br/>
      The sample data can be stored in the electronic sub-system and relayed to a centralized processing system for further analysis.
      <br/>
      The communications means between the electronic sub-system and the sensor subsystem is preferably wireless such as radio frequency or infrared.
      <br/>
      Application specific software can be included on the electronic sub-system assembly providing various user functions, options and control of the sensor sub-system.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="17">
      In FIG. 1, a prior art sensor system is shown and denoted generally as 10 where a light source 12 emits a light energy 14 of a predetermined intensity and wavelength known to interact with the sample 32.
      <br/>
      Various light sources may be used including a Light Emitting Diode (LED), laser, incandescent lamp, filament or other similar device.
      <br/>
      The light energy 14 is directed into lens 16 which focuses, directs and guides it into cable 18.
      <br/>
      The optic lens 16 is aligned about light source 12 and cable 18 to maximize coupling of the light 14 to other parts of the sensor system 10.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A signal splitter 20 is provided to direct a reference sample of the light signal 14 into instrument 24 via cable 22 allowing instrument 24 to track and monitor signal strength and presence.
      <br/>
      Light is coupled through connector 26 and probe length 28 into detector unit 30.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In operation, the coated fiber optic cable sensor 34 is inserted into a liquid sample 32 causing a molecular interaction of the chemistry coat with the sample.
      <br/>
      Thus, sensor 34 may be coated with a fluorescence emitting chemical which when exposed to the sample 34 alters the fluorescence emission.
      <br/>
      As shown, the sensor 34 has a core 36 which a molecular assay deposited thereon.
      <br/>
      A sample reading of the radiated emission light energy is received by instrument 30, via sensor 34 and probe end 38 so that the presence of sample 32 is confirmed by the detector 30.
      <br/>
      Likewise, sensor system 10 can be configured to detect gases, solids and/or other molecular property of a solution or compound depending on the sample/chemistry combination employed.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 1 illustrates a sensing system 10 wherein the optics 16 are not immobilized or fixed in stationary positions with respect to the electronics and where the electronics 20, 24, 26 and 30 are physically coupled with cables--a prior art sensor system of the type used in laboratory and research environments.
      <br/>
      The bulk and expense of such sensor systems lead to the development of more integrated miniaturized sensors as illustrated in FIGS. 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      For example, in FIG. 2 an integrally formed Surface Plasmon Resonance ("SPR") sensor 50 is shown.
      <br/>
      A substrate 52 provides a device platform to which a light transmissive housing 56 is coupled.
      <br/>
      A light source 58 is preferably located above or within the substrate 52 and has an aperture 58 there over allowing light to pass.
      <br/>
      A polarizer 62 is located near the aperture 58 to polarize passing light which, in turn, continues through housing 56 and strikes a SPR layer 64 which is preferably formed on an exterior surface of the housing 56.
      <br/>
      The SPR layer 64 may be deposited or placed on a glass slide or the like.
      <br/>
      This configuration achieves an optical surface phenomenon that can be observed when the polarized light is totally internally reflected from the interface between the layer 64 and the sample of interest (not shown in FIG. 2).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As shown, a mirrored surface 66 directs the reflected light onto a detector array 68 which senses illumination intensity of the reflected light rays.
      <br/>
      For optical radiation, a suitable photodetector 68 is the TSL213, TSL401, and TSL1401, with a linear array of resolution n * 1 consisting of n discrete photo sensing areas, or pixels.
      <br/>
      Light energy striking a pixel generates electron-hole pairs in the region under the pixel.
      <br/>
      The field generated by the bias on the pixel causes the electrons to collect in the element while the holes are swept into the substrate.
      <br/>
      Each sensing area in the photodetector 68 thereby produces a signal on an output with a voltage that is proportional to the intensity of the radiation striking the photodetector 68.
      <br/>
      This intensity and its corresponding voltage are at their maxima in the total internal reflection region.
    </p>
    <p num="23">A lead frame 54 is coupled to the opposite side of the substrate 52 and provides a signal pathway from the detector 68 output to the external world.</p>
    <p num="24">In FIG. 3, a miniaturized integrated fluorescence sensor 80 is shown having a hemispherical dome-shaped housing 82 which extends from the upper surface 86 of platform 84 forming a substantially encapsulating structure.</p>
    <p num="25">
      A light photodetector 88 is coupled to the upper surface 86 at a substantially central location within the housing 82.
      <br/>
      The photodetector 88 may be a light-to-voltage or light-to-frequency converter, such as the TSL250 or TSL230, respectively, thereby producing an output signal with a voltage proportional to the intensity of the radiation energy striking the photodetector 88.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Directly overlying photodetector 88 is filter 90 element which blocks light from the photodetector 88 outside a certain wavelength spectrum.
      <br/>
      Four (4) light sources 92, 93, 94 and 95 are coupled to the upper surface 86 surrounding the photodetector 88 at substantially equidistant positions from the center of the platform 84 and symmetrically arranged about and within the housing 82.
    </p>
    <p num="27">A power source 100 is also coupled to the upper surface 86 and operably coupled to the various active components of the sensor 80 including photodetector 88, light sources 92, 94, 96 and 98 among others providing power to all the electro-optical components within the housing 82 and allowing the sensor 80 to operate without an external link to an outside source of power.</p>
    <p num="28">
      Light emissions 97 and 99 illustrate the operational aspects of the sensor 80.
      <br/>
      Light 97 from light sources 9294, 96 and 98 is incident to upper surface of the filter 90 and the platform 84 where it is absorbed.
      <br/>
      The fluorescent chemistry 103 on the outer surface of the housing 82 interacts with the ambient sample(not shown) and produces a change in the fluorescence emission which travels toward the photodetector 88.
      <br/>
      The light absorbent filter 90 blocks out unwanted energy wavelengths which are outside the emission spectra of interest.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The A/D converter 105 receives an analog signal from photodetector 88 producing a corresponding digital output signal for digital storage and analysis. A/D converter 105 is coupled to upper surface 86 of the platform 84 and embedded within housing 82.
      <br/>
      Likewise, signal processing circuit 107 may be provided and coupled to platform 86 and communicably interfaced to the A/D convertor 105 to receive the output digital signal relating to the sample in question.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Data from signal processing circuit 107 may be sent to a remote processing system via interface 109 coupled to the bottom surface of the platform 84.
      <br/>
      A display may also be a provided on the exterior of the sensor 80 and used to render visual feedback to the user indicative of the sample under test.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In FIG. 4, a miniaturized light transmission sensor is shown and denoted as 125.
      <br/>
      Sensor 125 is a self-contained light transmission device having a platform 127 with at least one light source 129 which generates a light signal 131 optically coupled via light guides 133 and 134 towards photodetectors 135 and 136.
      <br/>
      As shown, one of the light guides 134 has an upper surface 149 which comprised a molecular coat known to interact with a sample of interest.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      At least one light source 129 is positioned about platform 127 with the photodetectors 135 and 136 coupled on opposite sides of light source 129 and disposed to receive light 131 traveling through light guides 133 and 134, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the sample of interest comes in contact with surfaces 149, the optical properties at the interface are measurably altered.
      <br/>
      This change is detected at photodetector 136 and may be analytically compared to the reference output of detector 135.
      <br/>
      As with other integrated sensor configurations, a lead frame 140 is provided as an interface between the internal sensor components and the outside world.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Yet another configuration of an SPR sensor 150 is shown in FIG. 5 wherein the shape of the housing 155 and mirror 160 provide some added advantages.
      <br/>
      Light 157 from light source 153 is polarized by polarizer 159 which diverges into the light transmissive housing 155 in the direction of planar mirror 162 which is disposed so that the plane thereof is not normal to the direction of the polarized radiation 158.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The diverging polarized light is directed toward a curved mirror 160 disposed on a curved exterior surface of the housing 155.
      <br/>
      When the mirror 160 is concave, the shape causes the radiation reflected therefrom to converge at the SPR layer 170 which can comprise a thin layer of conductive material such as copper, silver or gold having a substantially uniform thickness.
      <br/>
      Layer 170 is preferably planar although other configurations, such as convex or concave or otherwise featured may be used.
      <br/>
      The reflected radiation reaches detector array 175 wherein the intensity of the light reflected is resolved.
      <br/>
      A lead frame 177 is provide and secured to the housing 155 providing a signal pathway from the detector 175 to the outside world.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The invention relates to a sensor system using fixed optic miniaturized integrated sensors such as those illustrated in FIGS. 2, 3, 4 and 5 which provides numerous advantages over the prior art sensor systems.
      <br/>
      In that respect, FIG. 6 is a feature level matrix of a sensor system according to the invention and is denoted generally as 200.
      <br/>
      Sensor system 200 has an electronic sub-system 205 that is communicably interfaced to a fixed optic sensor sub-system 210 which includes all the necessary optics and photosensing electronics necessary for (bio)chemical sensing.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      A communications means 215 is provided to allow the sensor sub-system 210 and electronic sub-system 205 to communicate via a wide array of communications formats.
      <br/>
      For example, communications means 215 may comprise a plurality of signal paths or wires connecting the sensor 210 to the electronics 205 which define physical signal pathways.
      <br/>
      Fiber optic cabling, twisted pair wiring, network coax or other physical connections mediums may be used.
      <br/>
      Also, a communications protocol such as serial and/or parallel data transfers between the sensor 210 and the electronics 205 may be employed.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Likewise, communications means 215 may take the form of wireless communications system between the two sub-systems 205, 215 including radio frequency, infrared, satellite or other broadcast signal.
      <br/>
      Other contemplated communications means 215 are point-to-point, on demand, secured transmissions or other custom communications protocol, all of which are well known to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      On the electronics side 205 of the sensor 200, various functional features are provided and operably coupled to each other according to the numerous contemplated embodiments which will become apparent to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      A source of power 217 is provided to activate and run the various active components of the sub-system 205.
      <br/>
      Power source 217 can be solar, battery driven, alternating current, direct current, a generator or a remote power source, according to the invention.
      <br/>
      An interface 219 gives the user input and functional control of the sub-system 205 depending on the specific application of the sensor 200.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      A keyboard, control pad, mouse, touch screen or other mechanical means of control and input may form part of the interface 219.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the interface 219 may be implemented as a remote control subassembly of the electronic sub-system 205 which is operably coupled to the sensor system 200 for remote use and operation.
      <br/>
      In yet another contemplated embodiment, the interface 219 comprises a switch or button which the user activates in order to command sensor functions.
