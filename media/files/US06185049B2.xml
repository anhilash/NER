    <p num="1">This application is based on Application Nos. 10-100898, 10-158913, 11-31537, and 11-31538 filed in Japan, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a zoom lens system, and specifically relates to a compact wide-angle zoom lens system suitable, for example, as a photographic lens for a lens shutter camera.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Various conventional zoom lens system for lens shutter cameras have been proposed comprising three lens units of positive-positive-negative lens units to achieve high variable magnification (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Nos. 4-303809, 4-338910, 8-152559, 8-179215).
      <br/>
      Recently, zoom lens systems have been proposed with the object of providing a high variable magnification and compact lens system constructed of fewer lens units (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Nos. 4-260016, 5-188296, 8-179215).

      The zoom lens systems disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Nos. 4-303809, 4-338910, 8-152559, and 8-179215 have zoom ratios of 3 *  and higher, and are effective constructions from the perspective of high variable magnification.
      <br/>
      However, these lens constructions invariably use seven or more lens units, and cannot be said to provide adequate performance from the perspective of use of fewer lens units and compactness.
      <br/>
      The zoom lens systems disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Nos. 4-260016, 5-188296 and 8-179215 are constructed of fewer lens units, and provide adequate performance from the perspective of reducing the number of lens units and compactness.
      <br/>
      In these systems, however, the zoom ratio is approximately 1.5 *  to 2 * , which cannot be said to be a high variable magnification.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      From the perspective of cost reduction, a zoom lens system may be effectively realized using plastic lens units to construct the zoom lens.
      <br/>
      In a zoom lens systems used in lens shutter cameras, however, the effective use of plastic lens units is not known relative to a high variable magnification zoom lens system comprising three lens units of positive-positive-negative lens units with a zoom ratio of 3 *  and higher.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the zoom lens systems of the aforesaid disclosures, attempting to reduce the overall length of the system and reduce the number of lens units to attain greater compactness increases the optical power of each lens surface and generates greater aberration by each lens surface.
      <br/>
      Although it is possible to correct spherical aberration and coma among the generated aberrations by providing an aspherical lens surface, chromatic aberration is not correctable by an aspherical lens surface and is difficult to correct directly.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, correction of chromatic aberration is extremely difficult in conventional zoom lens systems even when the number of lens units is reduced to achieve greater compactness.

      According to the present invention as described above, a compact and high variable magnification zoom lens system can be realized using few lens units because it is possible to achieve compactness while producing excellent aberration correction by satisfying the aforesaid conditional equations (1), (2) and the like in a positive-positive-negative zoom lens system.

      <br/>
      When the range stipulated by conditional equation (9) is exceeded, temperature fluctuation adversely affects the balance between the focal lengths of the plastic lenses so as to make it difficult to minimize the change in focal length of the total system.

      When the third lens unit is constructed as a single negative lens unit, since the color correction within the lens unit cannot be corrected using the refractive index and dispersion of the lens as is the case in a two lens unit construction, it is necessary to control the chromatic aberration generated by the entire system by balancing the color correction generated by the other lens units.
      <br/>
      Conditional equation (14) is a condition for controlling the balance of chromatic aberration generated by the entire system.
      <br/>
      When the lower limit of conditional equation (14) is exceeded, the Abbe number is reduced, and chromatic aberration generation by the third lens unit increases, which disadvantageously affects the balance of chromatic aberration of the other lens units.

      FIGS. 19 through 22 are aberration diagrams corresponding to the eighth through eleventh embodiments; the diagrams show various aberrations (sequentially, spherical aberration, astigmatism, and distortion) in which diagrams labeled a.about.c show the shortest focal length condition (wide angle end), diagrams labeled d.about.f show the intermediate focal length condition, and diagrams labeled g.about.i show the longest focal length condition (telephoto end).
      <br/>
      In the diagrams, the solid line d represents aberration corresponding to the d-line, the dashed line g represents aberration corresponding to the g-line, and the broken line SC represents the sine condition.
      <br/>
      The broken line DM and the solid line DS respectively represent astigmatism on the d-line in the meridional plane and the sagittal plane.
      <br/>
      The vertical axis in the spherical aberration diagrams represent the light ray F number, and the vertical axes in the astigmatism diagrams and distortion diagrams represent the maximum image height Y'.

    <p num="124">The zoom lens system of the fourteenth embodiment comprises sequentially from the object side a first lens unit Gr1 including a negative meniscus first lens element L1 with a concave surface facing the object side and a positive meniscus second lens element L2 with a convex surface facing the object side, a second lens unit Gr1 of single lens construction including a diaphragm S and a third lens L3 with bilateral aspherical surfaces and positive optical power, and a third lens unit Gr3 of single lens construction including a fourth lens element L4 with bilateral spherical surfaces and negative optical power.</p>
    <p num="125">The zoom lens system of the fifteenth embodiment comprises sequentially from the object side a first lens unit Gr1 including a negative meniscus first lens element L1 with a concave surface on the object side and a positive meniscus lens element L2 with a convex surface on the object side, a second lens unit Gr2 including a diaphragm S and a third lens element L3 with bi-aspherical surfaces and negative optical power and a fourth lens element L4 with positive optical power, and a third lens unit Gr3 of single lens construction including a fifth lens element L5 with bi-aspherical surfaces and negative optical power.</p>
    <p num="126">
      In the zoom lens systems of the twelfth through the fifteenth embodiments described above, the third lens unit Gr3, and the second lens unit Gr2 in the twelfth through fourteenth embodiments, comprise a single lens element, and are the minimum number of lens units comprising a zoom lens system which changes the front-to-back spacing during zooming.
      <br/>
      In this way, the zoom lens system is constructed using the minimum number of lens elements as lens units, for the following reasons.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      Generally, in zoom lens systems using three or more lens units, the various aberrations generated by each lens unit are corrected within the lens unit to correct chromatic aberration at each focal length, so as to construct a total system which minimizes the aberration coefficient of each lens unit.
      <br/>
      Since lens units having chromatic aberration coefficients of different signs are essential particularly for correcting axial chromatic aberration, the lens units used in a conventional zoom lens system must be at minimum a dual lens unit comprising a lens element with positive optical power and a lens element with negative optical power.
      <br/>
      Since other aberration must be minimized by the lens unit, the number of lens elements naturally increases to assure design freedom.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      In contrast, in the zoom lens systems of the twelfth through the fourteenth embodiments, axial chromatic aberration generated by each lens unit is offset between lens unit which change spacing during zooming.
      <br/>
      Using this type of construction on the one hand achieves suitable chromatic aberration correction and increases to freedom for correcting aberration other than axial chromatic aberration within the lens unit, and on the other hand minimizes total axial chromatic aberration by mutually cancellation between the lens unit with positive optical power and the lens unit with negative optical power and without complete correction within the lens unit.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      Suitable axial chromatic aberration correction can be achieved between lens unit by satisfying the conditional equations below.

      Conditional equation (15) relates to the amount of axial chromatic aberration generated by the total system in the longest focal length condition, and stipulates the range of the axial chromatic aberration coefficient in the longest focal length condition of the total system.
      <br/>
      When the axial chromatic aberration coefficient exceeds the range stipulated by conditional equation (15) in the most extreme long focal length condition of the total system, it becomes difficult to assure performance tolerances as a photographic lens system.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      Conditional equations (16) and (17) relate to the amount of axial aberration generated by the positive lens unit and the negative lens unit in the longest focal length condition, and stipulate the range of the axial aberration coefficient in the longest focal length condition of the total system.
      <br/>
      In a zoom lens system, if the value of the axial chromatic aberration coefficient is so large as to exceed the upper limit of conditional equations (16) or (17), it becomes difficult to correct the axial chromatic aberration between the positive lens unit and the negative lens unit.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if the value of the axial chromatic aberration coefficient is so small as to exceed the lower limit of the conditional equations (16) or (17), it becomes necessary to correct the axial chromatic aberration within each lens unit, thereby increasing the number of lenses and requiring a reduction in the optical power of each lens unit, such that a compact zoom lens system cannot be achieved.

    <p num="133">
      Conditional equation (18) stipulates the ratio of the amount of axial aberration generated by the positive lens unit and the negative lens unit in the longest focal length condition.
      <br/>
      When the upper or lower limit of conditional equation (18) is exceeded, the axial chromatic aberration cannot be cancelled by the positive lens unit and negative lens unit, and as a result the total system axial chromatic aberration undesirably exceeds tolerance levels.
    </p>
    <p num="134">Since the axial chromatic aberration generated by each lens unit is appropriate in a zoom lens system which simultaneously satisfies conditional equations (15) through (18), a zoom lens system is produced which provides excellent correction of axial chromatic aberration despite using fewer lens elements in a compact construction.</p>

      Since there is extremely little generation of axial chromatic aberration by other lens elements when a positive lens unit which satisfies conditional equation (16) and a negative lens unit satisfies conditional equation (17), it is desirable that the value of the axial chromatic aberration coefficient of each lens unit approaches 0.
      <br/>
      When conditional equation (18') is satisfied in addition to the prerequisite conditional equations (15).about.(18), the positive lens unit and the negative lens unit generate nearly equal amounts of axial chromatic aberration, so as to mutually cancel one another.

    <p num="139">Conditional equation (18) conforms to previous conditions.</p>
    <p num="140">
      Conditional equation (19) stipulates the optical power of the positive lens unit.
      <br/>
      When the upper limit of conditional equation (19) is exceeded, the optical power of the positive lens unit is reduced relative to the focal length of the total system, which is advantageous for aberration correction beginning with axial chromatic aberration, but since the total length of the positive lens unit is greater, a compact zoom lens system cannot be achieved.
      <br/>
      Conversely, when the lower limit of conditional equation (19) is exceeded, the optical power of the positive lens unit is increased relative to the total system focal length, thereby excessively increasing the amount of aberration generated beginning with axial chromatic aberration, and making correction difficult.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      Conditional equation (20) stipulates the optical power of the negative lens unit.
      <br/>
      When the upper limit of conditional equation (20) is exceeded, the optical power of the positive lens unit is increased relative to the total system focal length, thereby excessively increasing the amount of aberration generated beginning with axial chromatic aberration, and making correction difficult.

      Conversely, when the lower limit of conditional equation (20) is exceeded, the optical power of the negative lens unit is reduced relative to the focal length of the total system, which is advantageous for aberration correction beginning with axial chromatic aberration, but since the total length of the positive lens unit is greater, a compact zoom lens system cannot be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="142">Since a zoom lens system which simultaneously satisfies conditional equations (19) and (20) provides a suitable balance between the generated axial chromatic aberration and the optical power of the lens unit used to correct axial chromatic aberration, a zoom lens system providing excellent axial chromatic aberration correction can be achieved despite using fewer lenses in a compact construction.</p>
    <p num="143">Furthermore, from another perspective, the axial chromatic aberration coefficients generated by a single lens unit comprising a lens element all have the same sign, and may be used in a zoom lens system to satisfy conditional equation (18).</p>
    <p num="144">
      Normally, in zoom lens systems, the axial chromatic aberration coefficient of each lens unit is reduced, to minimize the axial chromatic aberration generated by each lens unit.
      <br/>
      In this way, for example, even when a lens unit is constructed using a single lens element, the axial chromatic aberration coefficients have mutually opposite signs so as to nullify the axial chromatic aberration generated by the other lens unit.
    </p>
    <p num="145">In contrast, since the axial chromatic aberration coefficient need not be minimized in the zoom lens system of the aforesaid embodiments, a greater degree of freedom in correcting aberration is possible by using a construction wherein bi-surfaces have axial chromatic aberration coefficients of the same sign, such as, for example, a biconcave shape in the case of the negative lens.</p>
    <p num="146">With the aforesaid construction as a prerequisite, a compact zoom lens system with minimized total axial chromatic aberration can be achieved with excellent aberration correction using fewer lens elements by satisfying the aforesaid conditional equation (18).</p>
    <p num="147">
      In addition to the basic construction of the aforesaid three types, it is further desirable that the zoom lens systems of the embodiments satisfy the conditions below.

    </p>
    <p num="148">

      fW represents the focal length of the total system in the shortest focal length condition.
    </p>
    <p num="149">Conditional equation (21) stipulates the optical power of the third lens unit (single lens element) when the third lens unit is a single lens element with negative optical power in a zoom lens system comprising sequentially from the object side a first lens unit with positive optical power, a second lens unit with positive optical power, and a third lens unit with negative optical power, as in the previously described embodiments.</p>
    <p num="150">
      When the upper limit of conditional equation (21) is exceeded, it becomes extremely difficult to balance axial chromatic aberration and correct other aberration due to the extremely strong optical power of the third lens unit.
      <br/>
      Conversely, when the lower limit of conditional equation (21) is exceeded, the effective diameter of the third lens unit becomes larger, and the size increases in a direction perpendicular to the optical axis, such that a compact zoom lens system cannot be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      It is desirable that the zoom lens system of the aforesaid embodiments further satisfy the following condition.

    <p num="153">Conditional equation (22) stipulates the radius of curvature of the surface on the image side of the third lens unit (single lens element) when the third lens unit is a single lens element with negative optical power in a zoom lens system comprising sequentially from the object side a first lens unit with positive optical power, a second lens unit with positive optical power, and a third lens unit with negative optical power, as in the previously described embodiments.</p>
    <p num="154">
      Since the third lens unit requires strong optical power in this construction, the eccentric error sensitivity tends to be very high in the lens unit comprising the third lens unit.
      <br/>
      When the eccentric error sensitivity becomes high, the optical system becomes difficult to manufacture, and has extremely low practicality.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      In order to reduce eccentric error sensitivity while maintaining the optical power of the third lens unit as a whole, suitable aberration correction must be performed by the third lens unit.
      <br/>
      In the constructions of the aforesaid embodiments, the tertiary spherical aberration coefficient must be reduced to reduce the eccentric error sensitivity, and conditional equation (22) is a condition related to the correction of such aberration.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      When the upper limit of conditional equation (22) is exceeded, the curvature of the surface on the image side of the third lens unit (single lens element) becomes excessively large, such that the curvature of the surface on the object side becomes excessively small relative to maintaining total optical power of the third lens unit as a whole.
      <br/>
      As a result, spherical aberration generated by the surface on the object side is shifted greatly to the underside so as to make correction difficult.
      <br/>
      Conversely, when the lower limit of conditional equation (22) is exceeded, the curvature of the surface on the image side of the third lens unit (single lens element) becomes excessively small, and the curvature of the surface on the object side becomes excessively large relative to maintaining total optical power of the third lens unit as a whole.

    <p num="157">
      By using the axial chromatic aberration correction method described in detail above, it is possible to use only a single lens in both the second and third lens units.
      <br/>
      In this way, when two lens units are only single lens elements among the lens units comprising a zoom lens system, the total length of the zoom lens system is greatly reduced, so as to produce a very compact zoom lens system.
    </p>
    <p num="158">It is desirable that at least on surface of the second lens unit and the third lens unit is an aspherical surface in the zoom lens system of the aforesaid embodiments.</p>
    <p num="159">
      In order to achieve compactness in the zoom lens system of each embodiment, constructions providing extremely strong optical power are used in the second lens unit and the third lens unit.

      In this way, the eccentric error sensitivity is very high in the second lens unit and the third lens unit.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an aspherical surface is provided in both the second lens unit and the third lens unit so as to balance the eccentric error sensitivity and aberration correction of each lens unit.

      When the upper limit of conditional equation (23) is exceeded, it becomes difficult to correct aberration in the shortest focal length condition, particularly distortion.
      <br/>
      Conversely, when the lower limit of conditional equation (23) is exceeded, it becomes difficult to correct coma and spherical aberration in the longest focal length condition.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      The tertiary spherical aberration coefficient and the coma coefficient are closely related to the eccentric error sensitivity, and limiting both coefficients to suitable values is very effective in reducing eccentric error sensitivity.
      <br/>
      In particular, the tertiary spherical aberration coefficient of the lens unit must be limited to reduced the sensitivity relative to axial coma of the lens unit, and the coma coefficient of the lens unit must be restricted to reduce the sensitivity to the asymmetry on the image side.
    </p>
    <p num="164">Since the spherical aberration coefficient of the lens can mainly be controlled by providing an aspherical surface in the lens element of the lens unit, other aberration can be suitable corrected while optimizing the spherical aberration coefficient.</p>
    <p num="165">
      When a single lens element with negative optical power is used to construct the third lens unit, it is desirable that the bilateral surfaces on the object side and the image side of the single lens are aspherical in shape.
      <br/>
      Effective aberration correction can be achieved by having the third lens unit as a bi-aspherical lens.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, when the bilateral surfaces are aspherical surfaces as stipulated in conditional equation (23), in addition to the aforesaid aberration correction, it is also becomes possible to achieve excellent balance between the aberration correction and the error sensitivity, and in addition to this performance, also provides a zoom lens system which is easy to assemble and adjust.
