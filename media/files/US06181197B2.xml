    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Demodulation systems for the chrominance subcarrier of a video signal require use of bandpass filters accepting a signal with a relatively large dynamic range.
      <br/>
      The bandpass filters have quality coefficients defining the selectivity of these filters.
      <br/>
      These quality coefficients are relatively high, e.g., within the range 3 to 30.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In prior art demodulator circuits, these filters can be produced using integrated capacitors and transconductors.
      <br/>
      A transconductor is defined by its transconductance gm such that its output current is =gm * UPSILON e. The variable  UPSILON e is the voltage between the two input terminals.
      <br/>
      These transconductors must be able to be regulated to adjust the center frequency of the filter.
      <br/>
      The control of transconductance is provided by a servoloop using a filter structure analogous to that of the filter to be adjusted and a precise frequency reference.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A traditional example of a bandpass filter is illustrated in FIG. 1, and is described in an article titled "Active Filter Design Using Operational Transconductance Amplifiers: A Tutorial," by Randall L. Geiger and Edgar Sanchez-Sinencio, published in IEEE Circuits and Devices Magazine, March 1985, pages 20-32.
      <br/>
      More particularly, a description of this bandpass filter can be found in this reference on the final two lines on page 25, and the first fifteen lines on page 27 viewed with FIG. 7(a) therein.
      <br/>
      This reference discloses various structures for circuits (e.g., voltage controlled amplifiers, filters, etc.) based on transconductors for integration.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The filter illustrated in FIG. 1 includes first and second transconductors 10 and 11, respectively with transconductances gm1 and gm2.
      <br/>
      The first input (+) of the first transconductor 10 is connected to ground.
      <br/>
      The second input (-input or reverse input) of the first transconductor 10 is connected to the second input (-input or reverse input) of the second transconductor 11, and to the output S of the filter.
      <br/>
      The output of the first transconductor 10 is connected to the first input (+) of the second transconductor 11, and to the input E of the filter through a first capacitor C1.
      <br/>
      The output of the second transconductor 11 is connected to ground through a second capacitor C2, and to a monitor amplifier 12.
      <br/>
      The output of the monitor amplifier 12 is connected to the output S of the filter.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      This filter can be formed, for monolithic applications, in MOS or bipolar technologies.
      <br/>
      The transfer function of this filter is such that:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)

    <p num="10">
      By choosing the transconductances gm1 and gm2 so that the ratio gm1 /gm2 remains constant, a quality coefficient value Q that is independent of  OMEGA 0 is obtained.
      <br/>
      To provide a precise adjustment of  OMEGA 0, it is then necessary to vary the transconductances gm1 and gm2 in the same proportions, and to ensure the best possible matching between the transconductances gm of this filter and the transconductances gm of the servo-loop filter.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Firstly, this leads to a limiting of the ratio gm1 /gm2 to a value that does not exceed 4.
      <br/>
      The value of the quality coefficient can then be fixed by choosing the ratio C2 /C1.
      <br/>
      In order to obtain a high quality coefficient, the ratio C2 /C1 must be large.
      <br/>
      This is incompatible with the constraints of circuit integration.
      <br/>
      In effect, poor matching of C1 and C2 is obtained if C2 &gt;&gt;C1.

      In effect, it is at a high impedance.
      <br/>
      Small parasitic capacitances can cause changes in filter characteristics.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">The object of the present invention is to provide a bandpass filter that allows one to avoid the above described disadvantages by permitting a significant improvement in its performance.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention thus relates to a bandpass filter including first and second transconductors.
      <br/>
      The first input of the first transconductor is connected to ground.
      <br/>
      The second input of the first transconductor is connected to the second input of the second transconductor, and to the output of the filter.
      <br/>
      The output of the first transconductor is connected to the first input of the second transconductor, and to the input of the filter through a first capacitor.
      <br/>
      The output of the second transconductor is connected to ground through a second capacitor, and to a monitor amplifier.
      <br/>
      An output of the monitor amplifier is connected to the output of the filter.
      <br/>
      The bandpass filter further includes a third capacitor connected between the second input and the output of the first transconductor.
      <br/>
      A resistance bridge is also connected to the second input of the second transconductor, and to a common point between the second input of the first transconductor and the output of the filter.
      <br/>
      A second resistance is arranged between this second input of the second transconductor and ground.

    <p num="17">Advantageously, the respective values of the first, second and third capacitors are such that:</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="23">
      The filter of the present invention is of the same type as the filter illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      However, a third capacitor C3 is introduced between the second input and the output of the first transconductor 10, and a splitter bridge R1, R2 is connected to the second input of the second transconductor as illustrated in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 also illustrates the bandpass filter 22 included within a television processing circuit 20.
      <br/>
      The bandpass filter 22 receives and filters a chrominance subcarrier of a video signal before applying the filtered signal to a chrominance demodulator 24.
      <br/>
      A first resistance R1 is arranged between this second input of the second transconductor 11, and the common point between the second input of the first transconductor 10 and the output of the filter.
      <br/>
      A second resistance R2 is connected between this second input of the second transconductor 11 and ground.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The transfer function is then such that:  (Equation image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="25">and with the resonant frequency:  (Equation image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="26">
      The variable  OMEGA 0 can be adjusted by regulation of gm1 and gm2.
      <br/>
      The quality coefficient is such that:  (Equation image '7' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="27">By choosing C1, C2 and C3 according to the following relationships: C1 =m*C0, C2 =C0, and C3 =(1-m) *C0, the following transfer function is obtained:  (Equation image '8' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="28">The following resonant frequency and quality coefficient are determined as follows:  (Equation image '9' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="29">
      The choice of k and m allows one easily to obtain a high quality coefficient while at the same time keeping the values of the capacitors close to one another.
      <br/>
      At resonance ( OMEGA = OMEGA 0), the voltage  UPSILON c1 is such that  (Equation image '10' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="30">It is therefore possible to limit the value of the overvoltage, at resonance, at the intermediate node 13 by choosing m sufficiently small.</p>
    <p num="31">
      For choosing the parameters k and m, the following discussion is provided.
      <br/>
      The parameter k defines the division ratio in the bridge for resistances R1, R2: k=R2/(R1+R2).
      <br/>
      Possible values for R1 and R2 are the following:
