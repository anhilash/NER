      A fluorescent illuminating apparatus includes a translucent housing with a chamber within which a fluorescent medium is supported and electrical connections configured to provide an electrical potential across the chamber.
      <br/>
      An inductive-resistive structure is fixed sufficiently proximate to the housing to induce fluorescence in the fluorescent medium when an electric current is passed through the inductive-resistive structure while an electric potential is applied across the electrical connections of the housing.
      <br/>
      Preferred inductive structures for use with the present invention include elongate tape structures having a substrate with a conductive-resistive coating.
      <br/>
      A method of inducing fluorescence comprises passing a current through an inductive structure which is adjacent a fluorescing medium in an amount sufficient to induce fluorescent in the fluorescing medium in the presence of an electrical potential imposed on the fluorescing medium.
      <br/>
      An alternating current drive circuit for illuminating the fluorescent lamp includes a source of rippled/pulsed DC voltage, a polarity-reversing circuit and a controller connected to the polaritx-reversing circuit which periodically generates a signal to reverse the polarity of the voltage applied to the lamp.

      <br/>
      There are three basic types of such lamps.
      <br/>
      These are the preheat lamp, the instant-start lamp, and the rapid-start lamp.
      <br/>
      In each type of lamp, a glass tube is provided which has a coating of phosphor powder on the inside of the tube.
      <br/>
      Electrodes are disposed at opposite ends of the tube.
      <br/>
      The tube is filled with an inert gas, such as argon, and a small amount of mercury.
      <br/>
      Electrons emitted from the electrodes strike mercury atoms contained within the tube, causing the mercury atoms to emit ultraviolet radiation.
      <br/>
      The ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by the phosphor powder, which in turn emits visible light via a fluorescent process.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The differences between the three lamp types generally relate to the manner in which the lamp is initially started.
      <br/>
      Referring now to FIG. 1, in a preheat lamp circuit, designated generally as 10, a starter bulb 12 is included.
      <br/>
      Preheat lamp 14 includes first and second electrodes 16 and 18, each of which has two terminals 20.
      <br/>
      During initial start-up of the preheat lamp, starter bulb 12, which acts as a switch, is closed, thus shorting electrodes 16 and 18 together.
      <br/>
      Current therefore passes through electrode 16 and then through electrode 18.
      <br/>
      This current serves to preheat the electrodes, making them more susceptible to emission of electrons.
      <br/>
      After a suitable time period has elapsed, during which the electrodes 16 and 18 have warmed up, the starter bulb 12 opens, and thus, anelectric potential is now applied between electrodes 16 and 18, resulting in electron emission between the two electrodes, with subsequent operation of the lamp.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A relatively high voltage is applied initially for starting purposes.
      <br/>
      A lower voltage is used during normal operation.
      <br/>
      A reactance is placed in series with the lamp to absorb any difference between the applied and operating voltages, in order to prevent damage to the lamp.
      <br/>
      The reactance, suitable transformers, capacitors, and other required starting and operating components are contained within a device known as a ballast (designated generally as 22).
      <br/>
      Ballasts are relatively large, heavy and expensive, with inherent efficiency limitations and difficulties in operating at low temperatures.
      <br/>
      The components within ballasts are typically potted with a thermally conductive, electrically insulating compound, in an effort to dissipate the heat generated by the components of the ballast.
      <br/>
      Difficulties in heat dissipation are yet another disadvantage of conventional ballasts.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Referring now to FIG. 2, an instant-start lamp circuit, designated generally as 24, is shown.
      <br/>
      Instant-start lamp 26 includes first and second electrodes 28 and 30.
      <br/>
      Electrodes 28 and 30 each only have a single terminal designated as 32.
      <br/>
      In operation of the instant-start lamp, no preheating of the electrodes is required.
      <br/>
      Rather, an extremely high starting voltage is typically applied in order to induce current flow without preheating of the electrodes.
      <br/>
      The high starting voltage is supplied by a special instant-start ballast, designated generally as 34.
      <br/>
      Instant-start type ballasts suffer from similar disadvantages to those of the preheat type.
      <br/>
      Further, because of the danger of the high starting voltage from the instant-start ballast 34, a special disconnect lamp holder 36 must be employed in order to disconnect the ballast when the lamp 26 is not properly secured in position.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Referring now to FIG. 3, a rapid-start lamp circuit, designated generally as 38, is shown.
      <br/>
      Rapid start lamp 40 includes first and second electrodes 42 and 44, each of which has two terminals 46, similar to the preheat lamp 14, discussed above.
      <br/>
      The rapid-start ballast, designated generally as 48, contains transformer windings which continuously provide the appropriate voltage and current for heating of the electrodes 42 and 44.
      <br/>
      Rapid heating of electrodes 42 and 44 permits relatively fast development of an arc from electrode 42 to electrode 44 using only the applied voltage from the secondary windings present in ballast 48.
      <br/>
      The rapid start ballast 48 permits relatively quick lamp starting, with smaller ballasts than those required for instant-start lamps, and without flicker which may be associated with preheat lamps.
      <br/>
      Further, no starter bulb is required.
      <br/>
      However, ballast 48 is still relatively large, heavy, inefficient, and unsuitable to low ambient-temperature operation.
      <br/>
      Dimming and flashing of rapid-start lamps are possible, albeit with the use of special ballasts and circuits.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      It will be appreciated that operation of the prior art lamps described above is dependant on heating of the electrodes and/or application of a high voltage between the electrodes in order to start the operation of the lamp.
      <br/>
      This necessitates the use of ballasts and associated control circuitry, having the undesirable attributes discussed above.
      <br/>
      Recently, there has been interest in employing other physical phenomena to enable efficient starting and operation of fluorescent lamps.
      <br/>
      For example, EPO Publication Number 0 593 312 A2 discloses a fluorescent light source illuminated by means of an RF (radio frequency) electromagnetic field.
      <br/>
      However, the device of the '312 publication still suffers from numerous disadvantages, including the complex circuitry required to generate the RF field and the potential for RF interference.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the parent International Application No. PCT/US97/18650, a ballast-free drive circuit is disclosed which, in one embodiment, employs a direct current (DC) or pulsed DC source (see FIG. 25).
      <br/>
      It has been found, however, that operating a fluorescent lamp with a DC or pulsed DC source can lead to mercury migration in the lamp and an associated reduction of light output over time.
      <br/>
      This mercury migration problem may, therefore, substantially shorten the usable life of the fluorescent lamp.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Through experimentation, it was additionally observed that the fluorescent lamp drive circuit disclosed in the parent International Application exhibited unreliable starting of the fluorescent lamp, particularly when used with certain types of fluorescent lamps (e.g., T8 lamps).
      <br/>
      This starting problem was found to be related, at least in part, to an insufficient voltage being generated across the output capacitors in the drive circuit.
      <br/>
      In such instances, the capacitors were not always fully charged to an appropriate voltage level necessary to form the arc in the fluorescent medium.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      There is, therefore, a need in the prior art for an inductive-resistive fluorescent apparatus which permits simple, economical and reliable starting and operation of fluorescent lamps with low-cost, light weight, low-volume components which are capable of efficiently operating the lamp, even at relatively low ambient temperatures, which afford efficient heat dissipation and which are capable of operating at ordinary household AC frequencies.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to adapt such an inductive-resistive fluorescent apparatus to substantially eliminate mercury migration in the fluorescent lamp.
      <br/>
      It is additionally desirable to provide a fluorescent apparatus having the flexibility for enhanced features, including the ability to remotely control the fluorescent apparatus via a proportional industrial controller (PIC) or similar building controller.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is desirable to adapt such an inductive-resistive apparatus to direct "plug-in" replacement of incandescent bulbs.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The present invention, which addresses the needs of the prior art, provides an inductive-resistive fluorescent apparatus and method.
      <br/>
      The apparatus includes a translucent housing having a chamber for supporting a fluorescent medium, and having electrical connections configured to provide an electrical potential across the chamber.
      <br/>
      A fluorescent medium is supported within the chamber.
      <br/>
      An inductive-resistive structure is fixed sufficiently proximate to the housing in order to induce fluorescence in the fluorescent medium when an electric current is passed through the inductive-resistive structure, while an electric potential is applied across the housing.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the translucent housing and fluorescent medium are contained as part of a conventional fluorescent lightbulb.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In one aspect, the present invention includes a fluorescent illuminating apparatus comprising a fluorescent lightbulb; an inductive-resistive structure; and a source of rippled/pulsed direct current.
      <br/>
      The fluorescent lightbulb includes a translucent housing with a chamber for supporting a fluorescent medium; electrical connections on the housing to provide an electrical potential across the chamber; a fluorescent medium supported in the chamber; and first and second electrodes at first and second ends of the translucent housing, which are electrically interconnected with the first and second electrical terminals.
      <br/>
      The inductive-resistive structure is fixed sufficiently proximate to the housing of the lightbulb to induce fluorescence in the fluorescent medium when an electric current is passed through the inductive-resistive structure while an electric potential is applied across the housing.
      <br/>
      The inductive-resistive structure has third and fourth electrical terminals.
      <br/>
      The second and third electrical terminals are electrically interconnected.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The source of rippled/pulsed direct current has first and second output terminals interconnected with the first and fourth electrical terminals and has first and second alternating current input terminals.
      <br/>
      The source includes a first diode having its anode electrically interconnected with the second output terminal and its cathode electrically interconnected with the first AC input terminal; a second diode with its anode electrically interconnected with the first AC input terminal and its cathode electrically interconnected with the first output terminal; a third diode having its anode electrically interconnected with the second AC input terminal and having its cathode electrically interconnected with the first output terminal; a fourth diode having its anode electrically interconnected with the second output terminal and its cathode electrically interconnected with the second AC input terminal; a first capacitor electrically interconnected between the first output terminal and the second AC input terminal; and a second capacitor electrically interconnected between the second output terminal and the second AC input terminal.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In another aspect, a fluorescent illuminating apparatus includes a fluorescent lightbulb as in the first aspect.
      <br/>
      The apparatus further includes an inductive-resistive structure fixed sufficiently proximate to the housing of the lightbulb to induce fluorescence in the fluorescent medium when an electric current is passed through the inductive-resistive structure while an electric potential is applied across the housing.
      <br/>
      The inductive-resistive structure has third and fourth electrical terminals.
      <br/>
      In the second aspect, the apparatus further includes a source of rippled/pulsed direct current including a first transistor; a first capacitor; and a step-up transformer.
      <br/>
      The step-up transformer has a primary and a secondary winding with the secondary winding electrically interconnected to the first and second electrical terminals of the fluorescent lightbulb and the primary winding electrically interconnected with the first transistor, the first capacitor and the inductive-resistive structure to form an oscillator, such that when a source of substantially steady direct current is electrically interconnected with the oscillator, the first capacitor charges during a first repeating time period when the first transistor is off and the first capacitor discharges during a second repeating time period when the first transistor is active.
      <br/>
      The oscillator produces a time-varying voltage waveform across the primary winding of the transformer in accordance with the charging and discharging of the first capacitor during the first and second repeating time periods, such that a stepped-up rippled/pulsed direct current is produced in the secondary winding.
      <br/>
      A source of substantially steady direct current (DC voltage), such as a storage battery, can be electrically interconnected with the oscillator.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In yet another aspect of the present invention, a fluorescent illuminating apparatus includes a translucent housing having a chamber for supporting a fluorescent medium and having electrical connections thereon to provide an electrical potential across the chamber.
      <br/>
      The housing generally has the size and shape of an ordinary incandescent lightbulb, and the electrical connections are in the form of first and second electrical terminals adapted to mount into an ordinary light socket.
      <br/>
      The apparatus further includes a fluorescent medium supported in the chamber and first and second spaced electrodes located within the chamber.
      <br/>
      Yet further, a first inductive-resistive structure is included, preferably located within the chamber, and a source of rippled/pulsed direct current (DC voltage) is included which has first and second alternating current input terminals electrically interconnected with the first and second electrical terminals.
      <br/>
      The source also has first and second output terminals.
      <br/>
      The first electrode is electrically interconnected with the first output terminal and the second electrode is electrically interconnected with the second output terminal through the first inductive-resistive structure.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In still another aspect of the present invention, the source of rippled/pulsed direct current is converted to a low-frequency alternating current (AC) drive source.
      <br/>
      The AC drive source preferably includes an H-bridge circuit and an associated controller.
      <br/>
      The H-bridge circuit in combination with the controller performs a polarity reversing function, thereby substantially eliminating the mercury migration problem of the prior art.
      <br/>
      In addition to periodically reversing the polarity of the fluorescent lamp current, the controller preferably controls and maintains a lamp current having a predefined duty cycle, thereby providing enhanced dimming capabilities for the fluorescent lamp in accordance with the apparatus and method of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A preferred method of the present invention includes delaying the presentation of the drive source voltage to the fluorescent lamp for a predetermined amount of time so as to enable the output capacitors in the voltage multiplier circuit to fully charge, thereby substantially eliminating the starting problems which exist in prior art fluorescent apparatus.
      <br/>
      The method further preferably includes measuring the current passing through the fluorescent lamp and providing a control circuit, whereby the duty cycle of the lamp current, and therefore the lamp brightness, can be variably adjusted by the user in predetermined increments.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Any of the apparatuses of the present invention can be configured with a spike delay trigger or voltage sensing trigger to enhance starting at low voltage, and can include a fluorescent bulb having an inductive-resistive strip mounted therein.
      <br/>
      The inductive-resistive structures can include first and second spaced (preferably elongate) conductors, with a conductive-resistive medium electrically interconnected between the conductors.
      <br/>
      The conductive-resistive medium may be, for example, a solid emulsion consisting of an electrically conductive discrete phase dispersed within a non-conductive continuous phase.
      <br/>
      A preferred emulsion includes powdered graphite and an alkali silicate (such as china clay) dispersed in a polymeric binder.
      <br/>
      The medium may also be a coating portion of a magnetic recording tape.
      <br/>
      One or more discrete resistors can also be employed.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The conductive-resistive medium may be located on a separate substrate, or may be applied to the surface of the fluorescent lightbulb itself.
      <br/>
      Further, the inductive-resistive structure may be positioned in thermal communication with the translucent housing in order to aid in low-temperature operation of the inductive-resistive fluorescent apparatus, by means of transferring ohmic heat from the inductive-resistive structure to the translucent housing. (Even when there is no such heat transfer, the present invention provides better low-temperature operation than a conventional ballast.) It is believed that the inductive-resistive structure of the invention assists in starting and operation of the fluorescent lightbulb by means of an electromagnetic (e.g., magnetic and/or electrostatic) field interaction.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Another method of the present invention includes passing a current through an inductive-resistive structure which is adjacent a fluorescing medium, in an amount sufficient to induce fluorescence in the presence of an electric potential imposed on the fluorescing medium.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the inductive-resistive structure comprises a conductive-resistive medium electrically interconnected between first and second spaced (most preferably elongate) conductors.
      <br/>
      The conductive-resistive medium is preferably maintained within about one inch (2.5 cm) or less of the fluorescing medium, at least for starting purposes, in order to maximize the electromagnetic field interaction between the inductive-resistive structure and the fluorescing medium.
      <br/>
      In alternative embodiments discussed herein, the inductive-resistive structure may be maintained at a greater distance from the fluorescing medium.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Various types of conductive-resistive media are described in detail in Applicants' U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,758,815; 4,823,106; 5,180,900; 5,385,785; and 5,494,610.
      <br/>
      The disclosures of all of the foregoing patents are incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Specific details regarding preferred media for use with the present invention are given herein.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As a result of the foregoing, the present invention provides an inductive-resistive fluorescent apparatus offering relatively low weight, low volume, simplicity and low cost compared to prior ballast-operated systems.
      <br/>
      The apparatus is capable of low-ambient-temperature operation, which may be enhanced by configuring the inductive apparatus to generate ohmic heat and transfer at least a portion of the heat into the fluorescent lamp.
      <br/>
      Inductive structures which are relatively thin and which have a relatively large surface area can be fabricated according to the invention, resulting in efficient heat dissipation.
      <br/>
      The present invention also provides an inductive-resistive fluorescent apparatus which can be operated from DC battery power and which can be utilized for direct "plug-in" replacement of incandescent bulbs.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The invention further provides a method of inducing fluorescence via electromagnetic field interaction between an inductive-resistive structure and a fluorescent lamp.
      <br/>
      The method can be carried out using reliable, compact, light weight and inexpensive hardware according to the present invention.

      Referring to the drawings, FIG. 4 shows a first embodiment of an inductive-resistive fluorescent apparatus 50.

      The apparatus includes a translucent housing 52 having a chamber 54.
      <br/>
      A fluorescent medium 56 is supported within chamber 54.
      <br/>
      An inductive-resistive structure such as conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58 is fixed sufficiently proximate to housing 52 so as to induce fluorescence in fluorescent medium 56 when an electric current is passed through assembly 58 while an electric potential is applied across housing 52.

      As used herein, the term "inductive-resistive structure" is intended to refer to an electrical structure which is capable of inducing fluorescence in a fluorescent medium when an electric current is passed through the structure, while the structure is in proximity to the fluorescent medium, and while an electric potential is applied across the fluorescent medium.

      As noted below, it is believed that the inductive-resistive structures disclosed herein work by means of an electromagnetic (e.g., magnetic and/or electrostatic) field interaction with the contents of the fluorescent bulb per se.
      <br/>
      The term "inductive-resistive structure" is not intended to refer to inductive reactances, transformer coils, etc., which may be found in a conventional ballast, and which do not exhibit the properties of the present invention, i.e., the apparent electromagnetic field interaction with the contents of the fluorescent bulb.

      A number of materials are suitable for forming conductive-resistive coating 114.
      <br/>
      In general, suitable materials will include a non-continuous electrically conductive component suspended in a substantially non-conductive binder.
      <br/>
      Typically, the material constitutes a solid emulsion comprising an electrically conductive discrete phase dispersed within a non-conductive continuous phase. U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,610 to Walter C. Lovell, a named inventor herein, sets forth a variety of medium-temperature conductive-resistant (MTCR) coating compositions suitable for use as coating 114.
      <br/>
      The disclosure of this patent has been previously incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Typically, the MTCR materials are prepared by suspending a conductive powder in a polymer based activator and water; the material is applied to a substrate and allowed to dry.
      <br/>
      A preferred conductive powder is graphite powder with a mesh size of 150-325 mesh.
      <br/>
      The activator can be a water-based resin dispersion such as a latex paint; for example, polyvinyl acetate latex.
      <br/>
      A graphite slurry can be formed of about 10-30 weight percent graphite (preferably about 15-25 weight %), about 22-32 weight percent water, and about 48-58 weight percent of a high-temperature polymer-based activator.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the graphite slurry can be formed of about 10 to about 30 weight percent graphite (preferably about 15-25 weight %), about 6 to about 60 weight percent water (preferably about 20-40 weight %), and about 20 to about 65 weight percent polymer latex (preferably about 25-50 weight %).

      U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,785 to Walter C. Lovell, a named inventor herein, previously incorporated by reference, discloses a high-temperature conductive-resistant coating composition suitable for use as coating 114.
      <br/>
      The coating includes a substantially non-continuous electrically conductive component suspended in a substantially non-conductive binder such as an alkali-silicate compound.
      <br/>
      The electrically conductive component can be included in an amount of about 4-15 weight percent and the binder can be included in an amount of about 50-68 weight percent.
      <br/>
      These components can be combined with about 2-46 weight percent water.
      <br/>
      Following deposition of the material, it is dried to provide the desired coating.
      <br/>
      The electrically conductive component is preferably graphite or tungsten carbide.
      <br/>
      The preferred binder includes an alkali-silicate compound containing sodium silicate, china clay, silica, carbon and/or iron oxide and water.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that when weight percentages include water, the dried composition will have a different weight composition due to substantial evaporation of the water.

      A graphite composite which has been found to be especially preferred for use as coating 114 of the present invention includes powdered graphite and an alkali silicate dispersed in a polymeric binder.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the composite is a solid emulsion of graphite and china clay dispersed in polyvinyl acetate polymer.
      <br/>
      The composite can be deposited as a liquid coating composition, comprising from about 1 to about 30 weight percent graphite (preferably about 10 to about 30 weight percent for desirable resistivity values), about 20 to about 55 weight percent of an alcoholic carrier fluid, about 9 to about 48 weight percent of polyvinyl acetate emulsion, and about 4 to about 32 weight percent of china clay.
      <br/>
      The alcoholic carrier fluid comprises from about 0 to about 100 weight percent ethyl alcohol; with the remainder of the carrier fluid comprising water.
      <br/>
      A higher proportion of alcohol is selected for faster drying.
      <br/>
      Excessive graphite (beyond about 30 weight %) can cause undesirable coagulation, while excessive alcoholic carrier fluid (beyond about 55 weight % of the coating composition) can cause the mixture to separate.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      One highly preferred exemplary composite is formed by preparing a mixture of 97.95 parts by weight water (33.42 weight %), 58.84 parts by weight ethyl alcohol (20.08 weight %), 48.30 parts by weight graphite (16.65 weight %), 52.38 parts by weight polyvinyl acetate emulsion (17.87 weight %), and 35.09 parts by weight china clay (11.97 weight %).
      <br/>
      This mixture is applied to a substrate and allowed to dry.
      <br/>
      Additional details regarding preferred components are discussed below in Example 1.
      <br/>
      It has been found that increasing the weight percentages of water and graphite decreases the resistivity, while decreasing the weight percentages of water and graphite increases the resistivity.

      As discussed below in Example 1, the preferred polyvinyl acetate emulsion is known as a heater emulsion, and is available from Camger Chemical Company.

      This product includes polyvinyl acetate, silica, water, ethyl alcohol and toluene in an emulsion state.
      <br/>
      In forming the above-described slurry, suitable solvents other than ethyl alcohol can be employed.
      <br/>
      However, it has been found that isopropyl alcohol is relatively undesirable for use with the Camger heater emulsion, as it can cause the heater emulsion to separate.
      <br/>
      It is to be appreciated that upon drying, volatiles such as water, alcohol and toluene will substantially evaporate, thus resulting in different weight percentages of components in the dried coating.

      Items similar to those in FIG. 6A have received a "prime." It will be seen that construction is similar to FIG. 6A, except that strips 88', 96' are located on top of coating 114', since coating 114' and substrate 78' are preformed as the magnetic recording tape.
      <br/>
      Strips 88', 96' may be copper strips having an electrically conductive adhesive on one side thereof, to ensure electrical contact with coating 114'. Suitable strips are available from McMaster-Carr Supply Co. of New Brunswick, N.J.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      It will be appreciated that conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58 may take many forms.
      <br/>
      For example, in lieu of substrate 78, a surface of translucent housing 52 may be used as a substrate and conductive-resistive medium may be applied to at least a portion of the surface to form the conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly, as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      It is envisioned that outside surface 118 of housing 52 would normally be the most convenient to which to apply the conductive-resistive material.
      <br/>
      However, it is to be appreciated that it would also be possible to apply the material to inside surface 120.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is to be appreciated that magnetic recording tape, when used in the inductive structure, could also be applied directly to either outside surface 118 or inside surface 120.
      <br/>
      Of course, application of materials to inside surface 120 of housing 52 would potentially complicate fabrication of lightbulb 68 and therefore, as noted, outside surface 118 would normally be preferred.
      <br/>
      However, embodiments with inside coating are set forth herein.
    </p>
    <p num="43">It will be appreciated that inductive-resistive structures according to the invention, such as assembly 58, may be formed relatively thin and with relatively high surface area to achieve efficient heat dissipation.</p>
    <p num="44">
      Referring again to FIG. 4, conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58 is preferably positioned within about 1 inch (2.5 mm) or less of outside (exterior) surface 118 of translucent housing 52.

      The significance of this spacing will be discussed further hereinbelow, as will an embodiment of the invention where the spacing can be increased to, e.g., 12 inches (30 cm).
      <br/>
      Still referring to FIG. 4, it will be noted that housing 52 is preferably elongate, and conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58 is preferably substantially coextensive with translucent housing 52.
      <br/>
      However, as discussed below, in other embodiments of the invention it is not necessary for the housing 52 and conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58 to be coextensive.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Referring now to FIG. 5, which is a circuit diagram of the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, operation of the first embodiment of the invention will now be described.
      <br/>
      An AC voltage, such as ordinary household voltage (i.e., 120 VAC, 60 Hz), is applied between first terminal 60 and sixth terminal 100.
      <br/>
      Upon initial application of the voltage, a starter switch such as starter bulb 112 closes, allowing electrical current to pass through electrodes 74,76, causing them to heat and become susceptible to emission of electrons.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the electrical current passes through conductive-resistive coating 114 of conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58.
      <br/>
      The coating 114 is shown in the circuit diagram of FIG. 5 as a generalized impedance Z.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      It is believed that the passage of ordinary alternating current (such as 60 Hz household current) through the coating 114 results in an electromagnetic field interaction (symbolized by double headed arrow 122) between conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58 and fluorescent lightbulb 68.
      <br/>
      In particular, it is believed that the electromagnetic field interaction influences at least one of the fluorescent medium 56 and the gaseous material (such as mercury) contained within housing 52.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments of the invention, discussed below, a direct current having a "pulsed" or "rippled" component, or similarly an alternating current, is passed through a coating similar to coating 114.
      <br/>
      Such alternating current or "pulsed" or "rippled" components have been found to yield a measured "frequency," with a frequency meter, on the order of 60-1000 Hz.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is believed that the electromagnetic field interaction is also a low-frequency phenomena, on the order of 0-1000 Hz, depending on the frequency input to the inductive-resistive structure.

    <p num="47">
      As discussed further below in the examples section, bulb 68 will normally only start if conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58 is maintained sufficiently proximate to housing 52, preferably within about 1 inch (2.5 cm). (An alternative embodiment which permits increasing the distance to about 12 inches (30.5 cm) is discussed below).
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention permits the starting of a fluorescent bulb without the use of a ballast.
      <br/>
      Once the electrodes 74,76 have become sufficiently hot, bulb 112 opens resulting in current flow between electrodes 74,76 and full illumination of lightbulb 68.
      <br/>
      Once lightbulb 68 is fully illuminated, conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58 may be removed from the proximity of housing 52, and lightbulb 68 will remain illuminated.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In view of the foregoing description of the operation of the first embodiment of the invention, it will be appreciated that in a method according to the invention, electric current is passed through an inductive-resistive structure such as conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58 adjacent a fluorescing medium, such as the fluorescent medium contained within lightbulb 68.
      <br/>
      Current is passed through assembly 58 in an amount sufficient to induce fluorescence in the presence of an electrical potential imposed on the fluorescing medium, in particular, between electrodes 74, 76.
      <br/>
      As discussed above, it will be appreciated that the method may also include the step of maintaining the conductive-resistive medium of assembly 58 within about one inch (2.5 cm) or less of the fluorescing medium contained within lightbulb 68.
      <br/>
      The inductive-resistive structure used in the method can be any of the structures discussed herein, including the solid emulsion materials (such as the graphite composite) and the magnetic recording tape materials.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      It has been found that conductive-resistive medium and substrate assemblies 58 for use with the present invention are best specified by their resistance, in ohms, at DC.
      <br/>
      For a given composition of conductive-resistive coating 114, a given length of opposed conductor strips 88,96, and a given distance between the conductor strips, the DC resistance will be set by the thickness of conductive-resistive coating 114.
      <br/>
      The required thickness of coating can be determined by solving the following equation:
      <br/>
      R= RHO dS /(LS t)
    </p>
    <p num="50">where:</p>
    <p num="51">
      R=desired DC resistance,  OMEGA
      <br/>
      RHO =resistivity of coating material being used,  OMEGA -inches ( OMEGA -m)
      <br/>
      dS =distance between conductor strips, inches (m)
      <br/>
      LS =length of conductor strips, inches (m)
      <br/>
      t=required thickness of coating, inches (m).
      <br/>
      The resistivity value  RHO  should be determined for each batch of coating 114 by measuring R for a coating of known dimensions; for the preferred composition used in Example 2, the value of  RHO  is about 16.5  OMEGA -inches (0.419  OMEGA m).
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The appropriate DC resistance value for conductive-resistive medium and substrate assemblies 58 for use with a given fluorescent lightbulb is generally that which will result in the same voltage drop across the bulb in steady state operation with the assembly 58 as with a conventional ballast.
      <br/>
      It is determined by a process of trial and error.
      <br/>
      However, an initial approximation can be made as follows.
      <br/>
      First, operate the bulb with a conventional ballast and measure the RMS voltage drop across the bulb and the RMS current through the bulb (during steady-state operation).
      <br/>
      Next, calculate a "resistance" value for the bulb, R=V/I, where R="resistance" in ohms, V=voltage drop across bulb in volts, and I=current through bulb in amperes.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that, as is well known in the art, fluorescent bulbs have highly nonlinear volt-ampere characteristics; the calculated "resistance" value is for approximation purposes only.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The DC resistance value for the conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly should then be selected so as to achieve the same voltage drop across the bulb as for operation with the ballast.
      <br/>
      This can be done by applying the well-known voltage divider law to the series combination of the conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly and the fluorescent lightbulb, using the bulb "resistance" calculated above and the applied (e.g., line) voltage, to solve for the required nominal resistance of the assembly 58 �hereinafter, "calculated nominal R"�. It is to be understood that, although the conductive-resistive medium and substrate assemblies 58 are specified by their DC resistance, they are not necessarily believed to be purely resistive; indeed, it is believed that they may exhibit both resistive and reactive (i.e., inductive or capacitive) components of impedance at typical alternating current (AC) frequencies.
      <br/>
      However, the preceding procedure has been found adequate for initial sizing of assemblies 58.
      <br/>
      Further, it is believed that the current passing through assemblies 58 is, at least substantially, an ordinary conduction current.
      <br/>
      Yet further, inductive-resistive structures which are purely resistive (or substantially so) are contemplated by this (and the parent) application.
      <br/>
      Such structures can include discrete resistors, either singly or in assemblies.
      <br/>
      It is possible that such individual resistors, or assemblies thereof, could be utilized with the embodiments of the invention, for example, depicted in FIGS. 17 and 22 herein, and discussed elsewhere herein.
      <br/>
      While such (substantially) purely resistive structures would be dissipative, they would tend to minimize undesirable phase shifts as compared with reactive structures/ballasts.

      It is known in the art that ballasts are generally incapable of operating at low temperatures.
      <br/>
      For example, standard ballasts typically cannot operate below 50-60 (degree)  F.; operation down to 0 (degree)  F. is possible only with specialized, expensive, high power units.
      <br/>
      The present invention is capable of providing low-temperature operation (down to freezing temperatures).
      <br/>
      Such operation can be aided by using heating properties of the conductive-resistive medium employed with the present invention.
      <br/>
      Referring again to FIG. 4, coating 114 also generates ohmic heat in response to the passage of electrical current therethrough.
      <br/>
      Conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58 can be disposed in thermal communication with housing 52 in order to transmit at least a portion of the heat to housing 52, thus further aiding low-ambient-temperature operation.
      <br/>
      This effect can be still further enhanced by mounting the conductive-resistive medium 114 directly on housing 52, as shown, for example, in FIG. 7.

      It has been found that adhering the conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58 to the metallic housing 126 apparently enhances the electromagnetic interaction between the conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58 and the bulb 68, thus permitting the bulb to start when located further away from the conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58.

      The second top conductor strip has a first exposed end which is electrically interconnected with fifth electrical terminal 192.
      <br/>
      Assembly 158 also includes a second bottom conductor strip similar to bottom conductor strip 96 of assembly 58.

      The second bottom conductor strip has a first exposed end forming a seventh electrical terminal 232 as shown in FIG. 10.

      A second conductive-resistive coating 230 is located on the second substrate and is electrically interconnected between the second top and second bottom conductor strips.
      <br/>
      The first conductive-resistive coating 214 and the second conductive-resistive coating 230 are both represented in FIG. 10 as generalized impedances, ZHI and ZLO respectively.
      <br/>
      The first and second conductive-resistive coatings 214,230 are selected for effective dimming of lightbulb 168, as described below.
      <br/>
      A conventional incandescent light dimmer 234 is electrically interconnected between sixth electrical terminal 200 and seventh electrical terminal 232.
      <br/>
      As discussed below in the examples section, first conductive-resistive coating 214 may be selected to yield a DC resistance of 1000 ohms, while second conductive-resistive coating 230 may be selected to yield a DC resistance of 200 ohms.
      <br/>
      Optionally, resistor 236 and a second starter switch such as second starter bulb 238 may be connected in series between fifth terminal 192 and sixth terminal 200, for reasons to be discussed hereinbelow.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Selection of first and second conductive-resistive coatings for effective dimming preferably proceeds as follows.
      <br/>
      The minimum impedance value Z of the assembly ("assembly Z") formed by: series connection of coating 230 and dimmer 234 in parallel with coating 214 should be roughly equal to the calculated nominal R for the bulb, discussed above.
      <br/>
      However, a somewhat lower value can be selected to aid in starting.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The maximum impedance value of the assembly should be selected to dim the bulb 168 down to the desired level; a ratio of maximum to minimum impedance as high as 26:1 has been tested in another dimming embodiment of the invention depicted in FIG. 13 and discussed below and in Example 5.
      <br/>
      It is believed that even higher ratios may be usable.
      <br/>
      Conversely, any ratio beyond 1:1 should yield some dimming; in practice, dimming has been observed at a ratio as low as 2:1 in the embodiment of FIG. 16 discussed below and in Example 7.
      <br/>
      The foregoing discussion applies to all dimming embodiments discussed herein; the "assembly Z" is simply the effective impedance of the inductive-resistive structure(s) in series with the bulb.

    <p num="61">
      In operation, an AC voltage is applied between first and sixth terminals 160,200.
      <br/>
      Where desired, a step up transformer 240 may be employed to raise the voltage.
      <br/>
      In this case, line voltage is supplied to terminals 160', 200' and stepped up before being applied to first and sixth terminals 160,200.
      <br/>
      A stepped-up voltage will normally be employed for 48 inch (1.2 m) (and other longer) bulbs.
      <br/>
      Starter bulb 212 operates conventionally and permits preheating of electrodes 174,176.
      <br/>
      An electromagnetic field interaction symbolized by arrow 222 is believed to be present between bulb 168 and conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 158.
      <br/>
      Once the bulb has started, and it is desired to dim the bulb, the resistance of dimmer 234 can be progressively increased, thereby increasing the overall impedance between terminals 160,200 and reducing the overall current flow.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the lower current draw through the bulb 168 results in less of a voltage drop across bulb 168.
      <br/>
      The lower current results in dimming of bulb 168.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      In order to achieve starting of bulb 168, dimmer 234 must normally be initially in or near a full bright position (i.e., minimum resistance value).
      <br/>
      Resistor 236 and a second starter switch such as second starter bulb 238 are optionally provided to permit starting with dimmer 234 in a dim position.
      <br/>
      When dimmer 234 is in dim position, i.e., at a relatively high resistance not near the minimum resistance value, the total impedance of assembly 158 and dimmer 234 might be too great to permit sufficient current to flow to warm electrodes 174,176.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the second starter switch such as second starter bulb 238 in series with a resistor 236 may be connected in parallel with the unit which includes assembly 158 and dimmer 234.
      <br/>
      For initial starting, bulb 238 closes and provides a parallel current path through resistor 236, in order to insure adequate current flow to permit heating of electrodes 174,176.
      <br/>
      A suitable resistor value for use with a 48 inch (1.2 m) 40 watt bulb is about 100 ohms.
      <br/>
      Once electrodes 174,176 are sufficiently hot, bulbs 212,238 open and bulb 168 can start at a relatively low light level.

      FIG. 11 shows another alternative embodiment of the invention which is also provided with two elongate tape structures.
      <br/>
      One is selected for ease in starting the lightbulb, while the other is selected for efficient steady-state operation of the lightbulb.
      <br/>
      As used herein, "steady-state" refers to operation of the fluorescent lightbulb after the initial starting period.
      <br/>
      Components in FIG. 11 which are similar to those in FIG. 10 have received the same reference numeral, incremented by 100.
      <br/>
      Once again, the inductive-resistive structure of the embodiment of FIG. 11 includes a conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 258 which is formed with a second elongate tape structure including a second conductive-resistive coating 330.
      <br/>
      The second elongate tape structure includes a second substrate generally similar to substrate 78 of FIG. 4, and having top and bottom edges generally similarly to edges 80,82 of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      A second top conductor strip generally similar to top conductor strip 88 as shown in FIG. 4 has a first exposed end, generally similar to first exposed end 90 of FIG. 4, which is electrically interconnected with fifth electrical terminal 292.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a second bottom conductor strip generally similar to bottom conductor strip 96 shown in FIG. 4 is secured to the second substrate adjacent the bottom edge and has a first exposed end forming a seventh electrical terminal 332.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      A second conductive-resistive coating 330 is located on the second substrate and is electrically interconnected with the second top and second bottom conductor strips.
      <br/>
      The first conductive-resistive coating 314 is selected for efficient steady-state operation of the lightbulb.
      <br/>
      Resistance values of coatings 314, 330 can be selected in the same manner as set forth above for dimming purposes; the combined impedance of coatings 314, 330 (assembly Z) can be selected to be somewhat less than the calculated nominal R, for ease in starting.
      <br/>
      A second starter switch such as second starter bulb 342 is electrically interconnected between seventh electrical terminal 332 and sixth electrical terminal 300. (Note that the second starter switch (second starter bulb 342) of FIG. 11 is positioned differently than second starter bulb 238 of FIG. 10, and so has received an alternative reference numeral.)
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Second starter switch such as second starter bulb 342 closes upon initial starting of the system to permit both low-impedance conductive-resistive coating 330 and high-impedance conductive-resistive coating 314 to conduct.
      <br/>
      This yields a relatively low equivalent resistance (ZHI in parallel with ZLO) which permits more current to pass through electrodes 274, 276 to allow preheating of the electrodes.
      <br/>
      Once fluorescent bulb 268 has started, switch 342 opens, removing the low impedance conductive-resistive coating 330 from the circuit, thus permitting coating 314 to control effective impedance of the circuit, therefore resulting in more efficient operation.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that bulb 342 could be located at the opposite terminal of item 330.
      <br/>
      Coating 314 might be selected to yield a DC resistance of, for example, 1000 ohms, while coating 330 might be selected to yield a DC resistance of, for example, 400 ohms.

      Yet another alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. 12. This embodiment is quite similar to that of FIG. 11, and once again, similar components have received similar reference numerals incremented by 100.

      In the embodiment of FIG. 12, starter bulbs 212, 342 are replaced with a single switch such as push button type single throw double pole ("push-to-hold") switch 444.
      <br/>
      Switch 444 provides simultaneous, selective electrical interconnection between second electrical terminal 362 and third electrical terminal 364, and between seventh electrical terminal 332 and sixth electrical terminal 400.
      <br/>
      Second conductive-resistive coating 430 is selected for starting purposes similar to coating 330, and is removed from the circuit once push button switch 444 is opened, thus permitting efficient operation using only first conductive-resistive coating 414.

      Still another alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. 13. This embodiment is quite similar to that shown in FIG. 10. Similar components have received similar reference numerals incremented by 400.

      The embodiment shown in FIG. 13 is capable of automatic dimming in response to ambient light levels.

      Note that in FIG. 10, second conductive-resistive coating 230 is connected to sixth electrical terminal 200 through dimmer 234.

      In the embodiment of FIG. 13, second conductive-resistive coating 630 has seventh and eighth electrical terminals 700, 702.
      <br/>
      Coating 630 can be selectively connected into the circuit by means of an automatic circuit arrangement which will now be described.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Control relay 704 is capable of selectively connecting second conductive-resistive coating 630 into the circuit.

      The coil of relay 704 is connected across first and sixth electrical terminals 560, 600 in series with resistor 708, photoresistor 706, and diode 714.
      <br/>
      When the ambient surroundings are relatively light, photoresistor 706 conducts and energizes control relay 704.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 13, when control relay 704 is in an energized state, it removes second conductive-resistive coating 630 from the circuit by opening the connection between terminals 702 and 600.
      <br/>
      This forces all the current in the circuit to pass through the first conductive-resistive coating 614, which is of a higher impedance, thus resulting in dim operation of lamp 568.
      <br/>
      When ambient surroundings are relatively dark, photoresistor 706 does not conduct, and thus the coil of control relay 704 is not energized.
      <br/>
      This results in closing the connection between terminals 702 and 600, and thus, second conductive-resistive coating 630 is placed in the circuit, in turn resulting in a relatively low impedance path for current flow, with bright operation of lamp 568.
      <br/>
      Diode 714 and polarized capacitor 710 insure that relay 704 does not chatter.

      Second conductive-resistive coating 630 is also placed in circuit for initial starting of bulb 568 by means of a second starter switch such as second starter bulb 712.

      It will be appreciated that photoresistor 706 and control relay 704 together comprise a light-responsive switch for connecting the elongate tape structure which includes second conductive-resistive coating 630 in parallel with the first elongate tape structure which includes first conductive-resistive coating 614 by connecting seventh and eighth electrical terminals 700, 702 between fourth and sixth electrical terminals 566, 600.
      <br/>
      The first and second conductive-resistive coatings 614, 630 are selected for dim operation of bulb 568 when only first conductive-resistive coating 614 is in circuit, and for suitably bright operation of lightbulb 568 when both conductive-resistive coatings 614, 630 are in circuit.

      Referring now to FIG. 14, an "instant-start" embodiment of the invention 1000 is shown.

      Bulb 1002 includes first and second electrodes 1016, 1018 located respectively at first and second ends 1006, 1008 of housing 1004.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Bulb 1002 may be of the instant-start type, having only a single contact at each end.

      <br/>
      Bulb 1002 can even be a burned out preheat type bulb, with the connections at each end made to a remaining portion of the electrode, preferably the largest portion.

    <p num="72">
      Still referring to FIG. 14, apparatus 1000 also includes an inductive-resistive structure 1020.

      Inductive-resistive structure 1020 includes at least a first elongate tape structure similar to those discussed above, including a first substrate having a top edge and a bottom edge; a first top conductor strip secured to the first substrate adjacent the top edge; and a first bottom conductor strip secured to the first substrate adjacent the bottom edge.

      The construction of the first elongate tape structure is identical to that shown in the figures above for the preheat embodiment of the invention, and so has not been shown in detail in FIG. 14.

      This source may be a rectifier having first and second alternating current input voltage terminals 1032, 1034.

      Source 1030 is electrically configured to produce a direct current exhibiting a rippled/pulsed DC voltage component between output terminals 1036, 1038.

      Source 1030 could also be a battery connected to a pulse-generating network electrically configured to step up the battery voltage, in which case AC input voltage terminals 1032, 1034 would not be present.

      Frequency values of the AC component or "ripple" on the DC voltage have been measured from 60-120 Hz when a rectifier is used as source 1030 with 60 Hz input.

      FIG. 22 shows yet another embodiment of the invention, in which a conductive strip 1576 is mounted on a translucent housing 1504 of a fluorescent lightbulb 1502.
      <br/>
      Items in FIG. 22 which are similar to those in FIG. 14 have received the same reference character incremented by 500.
      <br/>
      Construction is quite similar to the embodiment of FIG. 14. For clarity, inductive-resistive structure 1520 is shown with only a single conductive-resistive coating 1526.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that inductive-resistive structure 1520 can be an elongate tape structure having top and bottom conductor strips 1580, 1578.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment of FIG. 22, third and fourth electrical terminals 1522, 1524 can be formed at the same end of structure 1520 for convenience, and third terminal 1522 can be electrically interconnected with strip 1576 through any convenient means, such as lead 1582.
      <br/>
      Thus, strip 1576 carries the same current which is passed through structure 1520.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      It has been found that locating strip 1576 on bulb 1502 permits bulb 1502 to start at a distance  DELTA  which is much further away from structure 1520 than would otherwise be possible (e.g., 12 inches (30.5 cm) instead of 1 inch (2.5 cm); see Example 11 below).
      <br/>
      It is believed that this is due to electromagnetic (e.g., magnetic and/or electrostatic) field interaction between strip 1576 and bulb 1502, as discussed above with respect to the interaction between inductive structures and bulbs.
      <br/>
      Due to proximity of strip 1576 to bulb 1502, interaction 1528 between structure 1520 and bulb 1502 apparently becomes less important.
      <br/>
      Thus, this embodiment of the invention is preferred when inductive structure 1520 cannot be located close to lightbulb 1502.
      <br/>
      Note that distance  DELTA  between structure 1520 and bulb 1502 is an approximate average value to be measured between structure 1520 and bulb 1502 when structure 1520 is substantially parallel to bulb 1502.  DELTA  is shown in FIG. 22 as being measured from a corner of structure 1520 for convenience only, so that the potential flexibility of structure 1520 could be shown.
      <br/>
      Note also that, while the embodiment of FIG. 22 is shown with an "instant start" configuration, the principle of applying a conductive strip to a fluorescent lightbulb will also work with preheat embodiments of the invention, such as those shown in FIGS. 4, 5 and 10-13.

      Finally, a 96 inch (2.4 m) T12 lamp has been operated using the same capacitor values as the 48 inch (120 cm) T12 lamp.

      As shown in FIG. 26, when loaded by the lamp and inductive-resistive structure combinations discussed above, the output measured between terminals 3036, 3038 is a full wave ripple or pulsed DC exhibiting approximately 175 volt peaks and 40 volt valleys with a "frequency" of 120 Hz, i.e., 1/120 of a second between adjacent peaks.

      The capacitors should be large enough to start and operate the associated lamp over a specified ambient temperature and line voltage operating range, yet should be small enough to yield a modest power factor (PF).

      The operation of tapped bridge voltage multiplier circuit 3000 will now be discussed.
      <br/>
      Assuming a sinusoidal input between first and second AC input voltage terminals 3032, 3034, with all nodes initially at ground potential, during the positive portion of a first cycle, i.e., terminal 3032 positive with respect to terminal 3034, current flows from terminal 3032 through capacitor 3058 and forward-conducting diode 3048 to terminal 3034.
      <br/>
      A parallel path exists through forward-biased diode 3042 and capacitor 3052.
      <br/>
      Note that any path through resistor 3060 is neglected, since this resistor will normally have a very large value and is effectively an open circuit; it is present primarily to bleed voltage off of the capacitors when the circuit is turned off.
      <br/>
      If the AC input source impedance is negligible, assuming a sufficiently small time constant, which is reasonable since no resistance (other than parasitic resistance) is present in series with either capacitor 3052 or 3058, at the end of the positive portion of the first cycle, capacitors 3052 and 3058 will each be charged to the peak voltage present during the positive half of the cycle.
      <br/>
      For example, for a 117 volt AC (rms) supply, the peak voltage would be approximately 165 volts.
      <br/>
      The polarities on the capacitors are as indicated in the figure.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      Considering now the negative portion of the first cycle, i.e., when second AC input voltage terminal 3034 is positive with respect to first AC input voltage terminal 3032, current flows from second AC input voltage terminal 3034 through forward-conducting diode 3050 and capacitor 3056 to first AC input voltage terminal 3032.
      <br/>
      A parallel path for current flow exists through capacitor 3054 and forward-conducting diode 3040.
      <br/>
      At the end of the negative half of the first cycle, again, assuming sufficiently small time constants, capacitors 3054 and 3056 are charged to the peak voltage of the input waveform, again, with the indicated polarities.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      Now consider subsequent positive half-cycles, i.e., first AC input voltage terminal 3032 positive with respect to second AC input voltage terminal 3034.
      <br/>
      Assuming all capacitors remain charged to the peak voltage (i.e., unloaded), diode 3042 will no longer be forward biased, since capacitor 3052 is already charged to the peak voltage.
      <br/>
      However, since the voltage across capacitor 3056 series-adds to the voltage at terminal 3032, capacitor 3052 now becomes charged to twice the peak voltage through forward-biased diode 3044.
      <br/>
      Similarly, during subsequent negative half-cycles, i.e., when second AC input voltage terminal 3034 is positive with respect to first AC input voltage terminal 3032, the voltage across capacitor 3058 series-adds to the voltage at terminal 3034, thereby charging capacitor 3054 to twice the peak voltage through forward biased diode 3046.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that, when no load is applied between first and second output terminals 3036, 3038, tapped bridge voltage multiplier circuit 3000 produces an output voltage between terminals 3036, 3038 of approximately four times the peak input voltage, i.e., for a 117 volt AC rms input, an output voltage of approximately 660 volts (DC) is obtained.
      <br/>
      Capacitors 3056, 3058 are optional, and if they are not used, under no-load conditions, the output voltage will be approximately 330 volts DC.
      <br/>
      Where capacitors 3056, 3058 are not employed, diodes 3046, 3048 can be replaced by a single diode and diodes 3044, 3050 can also be replaced by a single diode as set forth above.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      When a load is applied between terminals 3036, 3038, capacitors 3052, 3054 discharge through the load and supply a continuous direct load current.
      <br/>
      During each succeeding half of the AC cycle, however, the capacitors are recharged to their peak voltages, as described previously, replenishing the charge lost in the form of load current.
      <br/>
      The actual DC load voltage approaches four times the peak input voltage (assuming capacitors 3056, 3058 are used) for small load current demands, but drops sharply when the load current increases significantly.
      <br/>
      As the load current increases, the dc load voltage begins to exhibit a more pronounced ripple component which is twice the line frequency.

      As discussed above, when the tapped bridge voltage multiplier circuit 3000 is loaded with a fluorescent lightbulb and an inductive-resistive structure in accordance with the present invention, a typical output voltage waveform is experienced as shown in FIG. 26. The lowering in output voltage and the appearance of ripple are characteristic of voltage doubler and related type circuits.
      <br/>
      Significant discharge of capacitors 3052, 3054 is possible when they are substantially loaded but, of course, only occurs for a given capacitor during the time when it is not being charged.

      Primary winding 3124, first transistor 3118, first capacitor 3120 and inductive resistive structure 3104 are electrically interconnected such that when a source of substantially steady DC voltage such as storage battery 3128 is electrically interconnected with the components forming the oscillator, first capacitor 3120 charges during a first repeating time period when first transistor 3118 is off, and first capacitor 3120 discharges during a second repeating time period when first transistor 3118 is active.
      <br/>
      Thus, the oscillator formed by the aforementioned components produces a time-varying voltage waveform across primary winding 3124 in accordance with the charging and discharging of first capacitor 3120 during the first and second repeating time periods.
      <br/>
      Thus, a stepped-up rippled/pulsed DC voltage is produced across secondary winding 3126 and can be used to be operate lightbulb 3102.

      Any suitable source of substantially steady direct current can be electrically interconnected with the oscillator formed by the above-mentioned components, however, it is envisioned that the embodiments shown in FIGS. 27 and 28 will find their primary utility in operating fluorescent lightbulbs off of direct current from storage batteries.

      <br/>
      The fluorescent medium can include, for example, a phosphorous coating 3306 which works in conjunction with a suitable gas, such as mercury, contained within chamber 3304.

      Housing 3302 generally has the size and shape of an ordinary incandescent lightbulb, such as, for example, an ordinary 100 watt incandescent lightbulb with a length of approximately 4.5-5.5 inches (11.4-14 cm) and a diameter of approximately 2.5-3 inches (6.4-7.6 cm).
      <br/>
      As noted, electrical connections are provided, for example, in the form of contacts 3308, 3310 which effectively form first and second electrical terminals adapted to mount into an ordinary light socket.
      <br/>
      Apparatus 3300 further includes first and second spaced electrodes 3312, 3314 located within chamber 3304.

      The coating can be any of the previously-described coatings, which include a solid emulsion comprising an electrically conductive discrete phase disbursed within a substantially non-conductive continuous phase.

      A preferred form of coating is that described in Example 1 herein, but again, it is to be emphasized that any of the compositions described herein can be used.

      The nominal DC resistance can range from 400-1200 OMEGA .

      The nominal DC resistance value is selected to control the current in the lamp for the desired power and resultant light output.
      <br/>
      Too much power will shorten the life of the lamp, whereas too little will result in low light levels.

      Referring now to FIG. 31, in an alternative embodiment of fluorescent illuminating apparatus 3300', first inductive-resistive structure 3316' includes a rod-like substrate formed of an electrically insulating material, such as a plastic, fiberglass or ceramic, which is coated with a solid emulsion comprising an electrically conductive discrete phase dispersed within a substantially non-conductive continuous phase, with the emulsion being applied to the rod-like substrate.

      Again, any of the conductive-resistive coatings or materials described herein can be used, with the specific type of coating set forth in Example 1 being preferred.

      The rod-like substrate can have a diameter of, for example, 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) and have a nominal DC resistance value of 400-1200 OMEGA .
      <br/>
      Connections in FIG. 31 are the same as in FIG. 30, except that structure 3316' is rod-like instead of the coating type 3316 of FIG. 30. Note that when using the rod-like structure depicted in FIG. 31, the required coating thickness to achieve a desired nominal dc resistance can be calculated from the formula R= RHO LR /( PI Dt) where:
      <br/>
      R=desired DC resistance,  OMEGA

      Thus, the first and second inductive-resistive structures 3316", 3318 of FIG. 32 are essentially similar to the first inductive-resistive structure 3316' of FIG. 31. Once again, the rod-like structures can have the same diameters and nominal resistance values as set forth above.
      <br/>
      Typical lengths, in either application, can be about 3 inches (7.6 cm).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, one of the structures 3316", 3318 can be an insulated conductor (copper, e.g.) rod with, for example, an exposed end; in this latter case, the insulated conductor can be thought of (if convenient) as merely a "structure" and not necessarily an inductive-resistive structure.

      Referring first to FIG. 33(a1), a first form of spike delay trigger 3400 includes a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) 3402 having an anode A, cathode C, and gate G, as is well-known in the electronic art.
      <br/>
      Trigger 3400 further includes a piezoelectric disk 3404 (of the type typically used to produce a sound) electrically interconnected between the gate and anode of the silicon controlled rectifier 3402.
      <br/>
      In the present application, flexing of disk 3404 produces an arc to energize gate G of SCR 3402.

      <br/>
      A detailed discussion of a triac device can be found at pages 405-408 of the book Solid-State Devices: Analysis and Application by William D. Cooper, published by Reston Publishing Co., Inc. of Reston, Va. (1974).

      <br/>
      Spike trigger 3400, 3400' can have its first electrical terminal 3406, 3406' connected to an output terminal, for example, a nominally negative output terminal, of a source of rippled/pulsed DC voltage 3412.
      <br/>
      Source 3412 can include any of the configurations discussed herein, including those shown in FIGS. 19-21, 25 and 29.
      <br/>
      Second output terminal 3408, 3408' can be connected to an electrode of a fluorescent lightbulb 3414 or similar structures as disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      A suitable inductive-resistive structure 3416 can then be electrically interconnected between a second electrode of lightbulb 3414 and another output terminal, for example, a nominally positive output terminal, of source of rippled/pulsed DC voltage 3412.
      <br/>
      The interconnection of the silicon controlled rectifier 3402 or triac 3410, as depicted in FIGS. 33(a1) and 33(a2), creates a spike voltage and permits the drive capacitors of the source of rippled/pulsed DC voltage 3412 to fully charge before current can pass through the fluorescent lamp.
      <br/>
      This permits easy instant starts at a relatively low voltage and low temperature.
      <br/>
      The piezoelectric disk does not permit any current to flow until the capacitors are at a peak voltage; it then "clicks" allowing a spike voltage to start the bulb.
      <br/>
      The spike trigger can be thought of as a delay circuit.
      <br/>
      It is believed desirable that the delay be a spike or step function, and not a progressive analog delay.
      <br/>
      Thus, the piezoelectric disk is believed to be an appropriate way of achieving this goal.
      <br/>
      It has been found that a delay of approximately 1/2 second is workable, although any suitable delay can be used.

      Note that, as used herein, "spike delay trigger" includes any appropriate circuitry which advises a suitable hard delay; circuits 3400, 3400' are exemplary.

      Voltage sensing trigger 3500 includes a silicon controlled rectifier 3502 having an anode, cathode and gate.

      Trigger 3500 further includes at least one, and preferably a plurality of, Zener diodes, for example, D1, D2 and D3.
      <br/>
      The silicon controlled rectifier 3502 is electrically interconnected between the inductive-resistive structure 3516 and the source of rippled/pulsed DC voltage 3512, for example, with the anode A of SCR 3502 electrically interconnected with the inductive-resistive structure 3516, and the cathode C of SCR 3502 electrically interconnected with an output terminal, for example, a nominally negative output terminal, of source of rippled/pulsed DC voltage 3512.
      <br/>
      The at least one Zener diode has its anode electrically interconnected with the gate of SCR 3502, and has its cathode electrically interconnected with an electrical terminal of fluorescent lightbulb 3514 and with an output terminal of source of rippled/pulsed DC voltage 3512, for example, a nominally positive output terminal.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that when more than one Zener diode is employed, the Zener diodes are stacked anode-to-cathode.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, three 200 volt Zener diodes are employed.
      <br/>
      When the terminal voltage at the output of the driver circuit exceeds a predetermined amount, for example, 600 VDC (for the case of three 200 volt Zener diodes), the Zener diodes begin to conduct and trigger the SCR 3502.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the SCR 3502 have a sensitive gate, on the order of 1 ma or less.
      <br/>
      In the indicated configuration, a current limit resistor is not required in series with the Zener diodes 3560, in cases where the driver circuit (i.e., source of rippled/pulsed DC 3512) is not capable of delivering a current high enough to exceed the ratings of the components.

      As shown in plan view in FIG. 34(a1), clip 3420 has a central flat portion 3422.
      <br/>
      Further, as seen in both FIGS. 34(a1) and 34(a2), at the opposed ends of clip 3420, there are provided upturned portions 3424.
      <br/>
      As seen in elevation in FIG. 34(a2), these portions can form an angle  ALPHA c, for example about 10 (degree) , with the flat portion 3422.
      <br/>
      The distance Ac can be about 0.25 inches (6.4 mm), while the overall length Lc should be about 1/16 of an inch (1.6 mm) wider than the fixture with which the clip is to be utilized, as discussed below.
      <br/>
      Projections 3426 can be provided on the upturned portions 3424, and can protrude, for example, a distance Pc of, for example, about 3/32 of an inch (2.4 mm) beyond the end of the upturned portions.
      <br/>
      A typical width Wc can be, for example, about 1 inch (about 2.5 cm).

      An alternative embodiment of clip is shown in FIG. 34(b).
      <br/>
      It is essentially identical to that depicted in FIGS. 34(a1) and 34(a2), except that the upturned portions 3424 need not be provided, and instead, a central bulge or bump 3428 is provided.
      <br/>
      The bulge can have a height Hb of about 0.5 inch (1.3 cm) and a width Wb of about 0.5 inch (1.3 cm), and can be formed at an angle  BETA B of about 20 (degree) . The width Wc of the clip of FIG. 34(b), can be, for example, about 0.75 inches (19 mm).

      For convenience, the clip of FIG. 34(b) is designated generally by reference character 3430.
      <br/>
      With reference now to FIG. 34(c), a typical fluorescent lighting fixture 3432 is generally planar and has opposed upturned walls 3434.
      <br/>
      The clips are given a length Lc. which, as noted, is slightly larger than the distance between the upturned walls 3434.
      <br/>
      Clips 3420, 3430 are employed to secure an inductive-resistive structure 3416 to the fixture 3432 as shown.
      <br/>
      Upturned portions 3424 of clip 3420 can be used to deflect and permit compliance of the clip between the opposed walls 3434.
      <br/>
      Similarly, with clip 3430, central bulge 3428 can be squeezed by the opposed finger and thumb of a human hand, causing it to assume a first overall length which permits easy insertion between the upturned walls, and can then be released so that the points 3426 engage the upturned walls.
    </p>
    <p num="128">It will be appreciated that both of the preceding clip designs are sized and shaped to fit between the generally opposed vertical edge portions or walls 3434, and to retain the inductive-resistive structure thereto via elastic deformation.</p>

      Reference should now be had to FIG. 35 which depicts a manner of locating an inductive-resistive structure in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      In particular, as shown in FIG. 35, an inductive-resistive structure 3440 is formed as a conductive-resistive medium deposited on an interior surface 3442 of a housing 3446 of a fluorescent lightbulb.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 35, structure 3440 extends generally from a first end 3448 of housing 3446 to a second end 3450 of housing 3446.

      Second electrode 3458 can be electrically interconnected with second electrical terminal 3454 through inductive-resistive structure 3440.

      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, illustrated in FIG. 37, a fluorescent lamp drive circuit 3600 includes a polarity-reversing or commutation circuit 3606, preferably implemented as an H-bridge, for presenting a true alternating current (AC) voltage to a fluorescent lamp 3610.
      <br/>
      The preferred drive circuit 3600 depicted in FIG. 37 is suitable for use with the inductive-resistive structure and fluorescent lamp configurations of the present invention, as described previously above.
      <br/>
      By periodically reversing the polarity of the voltage across the lamp 3610, mercury migration is essentially eliminated, thereby extending the useful life of the lamp.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      With reference now to FIG. 37, a block diagram of a true AC fluorescent lamp drive circuit 3600 is shown.
      <br/>
      The drive circuit 3600 preferably includes a source of rippled/pulsed DC voltage 3602 having first and second alternating current (AC) input terminals 3612 and 3614, a positive (+) output terminal 3616 and a negative (-) output terminal 3618.
      <br/>
      Sources of rippled/pulsed DC voltage which are suitable for use with the present invention have been previously described herein and illustrated in FIGS. 19-29. It is to be understood that these configurations are only exemplary, and that any type of device which produces a rippled/pulsed DC voltage, of an appropriate voltage level to sustain fluorescence in the lamp, is suitable for use with the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      The output voltage from rippled/pulsed DC source 3602 is preferably fed to a commutation or polarity-reversing circuit 3606 through a series-connected inductive-resistive structure 3604 (labeled "Z" in FIG. 37).
      <br/>
      Suitable inductive-resistive structures are described in detail herein above and in the parent applications.
      <br/>
      Although FIG. 37 illustrates inductive-resistive structure 3604 as being connected in series with the positive output terminal 3616 of rippled/pulsed DC source 3602, it is to be understood that inductive-resistive structure 3604 may alternatively be connected in series with the negative output terminal 3618 as well.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      With continued reference to FIG. 37, commutation circuit 3606 preferably includes first and second input terminals 3628 and 3618, first and second output terminals 3630 and 3632 and at least one control input terminal 3620.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the commutation circuit 3606 produces a true AC voltage for operating the fluorescent lamp 3610 which is electrically connected across output terminals 3630, 3632 of the commutation circuit 3606.
      <br/>
      Commutation circuit 3606 operates functionally as a double pole double throw (DPDT) switch, similar to the switch shown in FIG. 17 as reference number 1364, which is responsive to a control signal at control input terminal 3620.
      <br/>
      Depending on the value of the control signal, the voltage at the output of the commutation circuit 3630, 3632 may either essentially have the same polarity as the input voltage, or may be essentially reversed in polarity compared to the input voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      For certain applications, it is desirable to have control over the duty cycle of the output voltage appearing at commutation output terminals 3630, 3632.
      <br/>
      In order to control the duty cycle of the output voltage, and thereby vary the brightness of the lamp, commutation circuit 3606 preferably includes an "off" state, where the current flowing through output terminals 3630, 3632 of commutation circuit 3606, and thus through the lamp 3610, is substantially zero.
      <br/>
      This is the functional equivalent of replacing the DPDT switch 1364 of FIG. 17 with a double pole double throw, center-off switch (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      With the addition of an "off" state, it is to be appreciated that if commutation circuit 3606 is only responsive to a control signal employing binary logic (i.e., having only two possible values), a minimum of two control inputs will be required for commutation circuit 3606 to decode the three possible output states.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a single control input 3620 may be used where the control signal is not confined to a binary value, such as when using a multi-valued logic signal.
      <br/>
      FIG. 39 depicts typical waveforms of the lamp current for three different duty cycles, namely, ten percent (10%), fifty percent (50%) and ninety percent (90%) duty cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      Still referring to FIG. 37, the control signal which governs the state of the commutation or polarity-reversing circuit 3606 is preferably generated by a controller 3608, which is operatively connected to commutation circuit 3606 via control input terminal 3620.
      <br/>
      The controller 3608 is preferably responsive to user-defined inputs 3624, 3626 for selecting, for example, running current and lamp brightness.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is preferred that controller 3608 include circuitry capable of measuring the current passing through the lamp and being responsive to a difference between the measured lamp current and a reference current value selected by the user, such that the user-defined lamp current is monitored and maintained through the lamp.
      <br/>
      Such circuitry may preferably be realized as a constant current feedback loop or similar arrangement.
      <br/>
      Using feedback control of the lamp current, controller 3608 can preferably compensate for aging components or changes in the AC input line voltage, and therefore a much higher degree of line and load regulation is possible.

    <p num="137">
      In FIG. 38, there is shown a partial block diagram of a preferred implementation of the polarity-reversing commutation circuit and the controller described above and illustrated in FIG. 37. With reference now to FIG. 38, the commutation circuit is preferably implemented as an H-bridge comprising four field effect transistors (FET) 3714, 3716, 3718 and 3720, each FET having a drain (D), a source (S) and a gate (G) terminal, and corresponding gate drive circuitry 3706, 3708, 3710 and 3712 respectively.
      <br/>
      It is to be appreciated that although the use of FET devices is preferred, other equivalent devices, for example, bipolar junction transistors (BJT), may similarly be used.
      <br/>
      Additionally, other suitable configurations for implementing the polarity-reversing commutation circuit are contemplated by the present invention utilizing, for example, silicon controlled rectifiers (SCR), triacs and the like.

    <p num="138">
      With continued reference to FIG. 38, a source of rippled/pulsed DC voltage in the form of a tapped bridge voltage multiplier circuit 3000' is preferably operatively connected to input terminals 3738 and 3740 of the H-bridge.
      <br/>
      The rippled/pulsed DC voltage source 3000' is essentially the same as the circuit described above and shown in FIG. 25, with similar components receiving similar reference numerals designated with a prime (').
      <br/>
      Preferably, inductive-resistive structure 3704, of a type described in detail herein above, is connected in series with one of the output terminals, for example 3036' (which can be, e.g., positive), of the rippled/pulsed DC source 3000'.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      In order to provide power for the drive circuit components, an auxiliary rectifier 3730, for example a bridge rectifier, and an auxiliary power supply 3728 may be connected to the AC input line 3032', 3034' in a conventional fashion.
      <br/>
      The auxiliary power supply 3728 preferably provides separate isolated DC power supply lines for each of the FET gate drive circuits 3706, 3708, 3710, 3712, as well as for controller 3702, such that no short circuit hazard exists, particularly when connecting controller 3702 to a remote dimming device through remote dimming control line 3734.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      As illustrated in FIG. 38, the H-bridge circuit is preferably connected such that a first input terminal 3738 is formed at the electrical interconnection of the drains of field effect transistors (FET) 3714 and 3716.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a second H-bridge input terminal 3740 is preferably formed at the electrical interconnection of the sources of FET devices 3718 and 3720.
      <br/>
      A first H-bridge output terminal 3742 is preferably formed at the electrical interconnection of the source of FET 3714 and the drain of FET 3718, and, similarly, a second H-bridge output terminal 3740 is preferably formed at the electrical interconnection of the source of FET 3716 and the drain of FET 3720.
      <br/>
      The fluorescent lamp 3726 is operatively connected between the output terminals 3740, 3742 of the H-bridge circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      With continued reference to FIG. 38, the operation of the polarity-reversing H-bridge circuit will now be discussed.
      <br/>
      Each field effect transistor (FET) 3706, 3708, 3710, 3712 preferably functions as a switch or transmission gate, individually controlled by a voltage applied between the gate and source terminals of the FET.
      <br/>
      In order for a FET to turn on, the gate-to-source potential (VGS) must exceed a predefined threshold voltage (VT), which varies depending on the particular FET device.
      <br/>
      As appreciated by those skilled in the art, in a FET switch arrangement, the resistance between the drain and source terminals of the FET will ideally approach zero ohms (i.e., a short circuit) when the FET is in an "on" state, and will ideally exhibit infinite resistance (i.e., an open circuit) when the FET is in an "off" state.
      <br/>
      A detailed discussion of a FET switch can be found, for example, at pages 198-211 of the text CMOS Analog Circuit Design, by Phillip E. Allen and Douglas R. Holberg, published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1987, which is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      Gate driver circuits 3706, 3708, 3710, 3712 are preferably operatively connected between the gate and source terminals of FET devices 3714, 3718, 3716 and 3720 respectively, and provide an appropriate drive voltage (e.g., about 15 volts) such that the FET devices are in the on state.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a first pair of FET devices 3714, 3720 are turned on essentially simultaneously by their associated gate drivers 3706, 3712 respectively.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a second pair of FET devices 3716, 3718 are preferably turned on, essentially simultaneously, by their associated gate drivers 3710, 3708.
      <br/>
      The polarity-reversing operation of the H-bridge is preferably accomplished by alternately enabling either the first pair of gate drivers 3706, 3712 or the second pair of gate drivers 3710, 3708, thereby turning on either the first FET device pair 3714, 3720 or the second FET device pair 3716, 3718 respectively.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the duty cycle of the lamp current may be controlled by selectively disabling the gate drive to all FET devices 3714, 3716, 3718, 3720 for a predetermined period of time.
      <br/>
      As discussed above, the control signals for selectively enabling or disabling the FET gate drivers 3706, 3708, 3710, 3712, thus producing the output current waveforms shown in FIG. 39, are generated by controller 3702.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      Controller 3702 may be realized as a microcontroller, such as Motorola MC6805 or equivalent.
      <br/>
      The microcontroller 3702 preferably includes memory and is able to run user-programmed application software routines for selectively controlling, among other things, the frequency and duty cycle of the output voltage from the H-bridge.
      <br/>
      It is to be appreciated that other means for controlling the H-bridge gate drivers, and thus the FET devices, are contemplated by the present invention (e.g., a flip-flop toggle arrangement or the like, known by those skilled in the art).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, in addition to controlling the "on" period of the H-bridge FET devices, the present invention alternatively contemplates a controller which alters the duty cycle of the H-bridge output voltage by fixing the on (or off) time and instead varying the frequency (thereby indirectly controlling the duty cycle).
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      Because of the inherent flexibility of microcontroller 3702 (e.g., by changing the microcontroller program code which is resident in the microcontroller memory), the fluorescent apparatus drive circuit 3700 of the present invention preferably provides enhanced features which are commercially desirable, such as remote dimming of the lamp in response to external sensors (e.g., motion sensor, light sensor, etc.) or computer control of the fluorescent apparatus via an RS-232 bus.
      <br/>
      For example, the drive circuit 3700 may be used in conjunction with a light sensor to preferably vary the brightness of the lamp in response to ambient light levels.
      <br/>
      In this manner, a constant predefined light level may be maintained in a particular area, thereby producing a substantial reduction in utility costs.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      Unlike conventional fluorescent lighting control circuits (e.g., using silicon controlled rectifiers, triacs, or the like) operating at high voltages (e.g., 120 volts AC or more), the apparatus of the present invention is able to use low voltage DC control signals (e.g., 5 volts) to remotely control selective fluorescent lamps.
      <br/>
      These low voltage control signals are substantially safer to work with and may be easily carried over thin copper wires, even over long distances.
      <br/>
      This is one important feature of the fluorescent drive circuit of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="146">
      As an added desirable feature of the present invention, microcontroller 3702 may preferably be configured to select and maintain a predetermined lamp current by measuring the current flowing through lamp 3726 and comparing the measured lamp current with a predefined reference current, which may be selected by the user.
      <br/>
      In order to monitor the current flowing through the fluorescent lamp 3726, a current-sensing transformer 3724 may preferably be connected in series with lamp 3726.
      <br/>
      Current passing through the primary winding of transformer 3724 induces an isolated sense current in the secondary winding which is proportional to the lamp current.
      <br/>
      This sense current is preferably rectified and filtered by a rectifier and filter circuit 3722, thereby producing a corresponding DC (or rippled/pulsed DC) sense voltage that is directly related to the lamp current.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      As shown in FIG. 38, the DC sense voltage may preferably be fed to an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) which is embedded in the microcontroller 3702.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, an external ADC may be employed where controller 3702 does not include an embedded ADC.
      <br/>
      Suitable ADCs for use in the present invention are commercially available, for example, from Analog Devices, Inc. (e.g., AD-571, or equivalent).
      <br/>
      The function of an ADC is to convert an analog quantity such as a voltage or current into a digital word.
      <br/>
      A detailed discussion of analog-to-digital converters may be found at pages 825-878 of the text Bipolar and MOS Analog Integrated Circuit Design, by Alan B. Grebene, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1984, which is incorporated herein by reference, and will, therefore, not be presented herein.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      Once the sense voltage is converted to a digital word by the analog-to-digital converter, microcontroller 3702 preferably responds to the digital word by generating an appropriate control signal(s), according to the user application program, to adjust the duty cycle of the drive voltage produced at the output 3740, 3742 of the H-bridge.
      <br/>
      For example, if the measured lamp current is above the predefined reference current value, controller 3702 will preferably generate the appropriate control signal(s) to lower the duty cycle of the H-bridge output voltage, thereby reducing the lamp current.
      <br/>
      Similarly, if the measured lamp current is below the predefined reference current value, controller 3702 will preferably generate the appropriate control signal(s) to increase the duty cycle of the H-bridge output drive voltage, thereby increasing the lamp current.
      <br/>
      In this fashion, microcontroller 3702 may continuously compensate for changes in the load or AC input line voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      To insure reliable starting of the fluorescent lamp, microcontroller 3702 may preferably be programmed to delay the application of the output drive voltage to the lamp to allow output drive capacitors 3052', 3054', 3056' and 3058' in the rippled/pulsed DC voltage multiplier circuit 3000' to charge to an appropriate voltage level to start the lamp.
      <br/>
      A delay of approximately one half (1/2) second after AC power is first applied to the rippled/pulsed DC circuit 3000' is generally ample time for capacitors 3052', 3054', 3056', 3058' to fully charge.
      <br/>
      The delay may preferably be accomplished by holding each of the FET devices 3714, 3716, 3718, 3720 in the H-bridge off for the desired period of delay time (e.g., 1/2 second).
      <br/>
      Using this delay approach, a spike trigger circuit, as described herein above, may be omitted.

      For example, for FET devices 3714' and 3716', each gate driver preferably includes six buffers 3848 (preferably contained in a single integrated circuit package, for example, Motorola MC14050B or equivalent) connected in parallel between the output of an optocoupler 3846 and the gate terminal of a corresponding FET device.
      <br/>
      Similarly, for FET devices 3718' and 3720', each gate driver preferably includes three buffers 3848 connected in parallel in the same manner.
      <br/>
      In the circuit of FIGS. 40A-40D, multiple buffers are shown connected in parallel between the output of an optocoupler and the gate terminal of a corresponding FET in order to avoid wasting unused logic gates in an individually packaged device containing multiple buffers.
      <br/>
      It is to be appreciated, however, that a single buffer which provides the appropriate gain may alternatively be used.

    <p num="155">
      The control signals generated by microcontroller 3802 for controlling the H-bridge FET devices are each preferably electrically connected to the base terminal of an npn bipolar junction transistor (BJT) 3852, such as 2N4401 or equivalent, through a current limiting base resistor 3850.
      <br/>
      Transistors 3852 provide additional current capability for driving optocoupler devices 3846.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the present invention contemplates the use of pnp bipolar transistors, or other equivalent devices (e.g., field effect transistors), and associated biasing components to provide the necessary current for driving the optocoupler devices 3846.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      The H-bridge drive circuit is preferably controlled by microcontroller 3802, for example, Motorola MC68HC05P6A or equivalent.
      <br/>
      Microcontroller 3802 preferably includes an embedded analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and user-programmable memory, which reduces component count by eliminating the need for an external ADC, memory, and associated control and interface logic.
      <br/>
      Microcontroller 3802 preferably executes instructions according to its embedded user-programmable read-only memory (ROM).
      <br/>
      An exemplary microcontroller program is illustrated by the main loop flowchart of FIG. 42. As appreciated by those skilled in the art, the present invention contemplates various software program routines that may be developed to perform the functions depicted in the flowchart.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      With reference to FIG. 42, the main loop program preferably incorporates the capability of delaying the presentation of the lamp drive voltage for a predetermined period of time, allowing the output drive capacitors in the pulsed/rippled DC voltage source to substantially charge to the full 650 volts.
      <br/>
      This insures reliable starting of the lamp.
      <br/>
      The main loop program further preferably includes a routine to measure and maintain a constant predefined current in the lamp.
      <br/>
      This software routine also preferably includes a feature whereby if the measured current exceeds the user-preset reference current for greater than three measurement periods, the H-bridge FET devices are all held in the "off" state (thereby shutting down the lamp drive current) until either the microcontroller receives a reset signal, or the power to the microcontroller is removed and then re-applied.
      <br/>
      This provides important safety benefits by removing the presence of high voltage at the lamp terminals when, for example, this is no lamp present, thus reducing the possibility of electric shock.
      <br/>
      An additional exemplary program routine for performing the function of duty cycle control is shown in the flowchart of FIG. 43, and may be included as part of the main loop microcontroller program.

      Referring again to FIGS. 40A-40D, associated with microcontroller 3802 are various external components which are essential for proper operation of microcontroller 3802.
      <br/>
      For example, an oscillator circuit 3806, preferably comprising a crystal oscillator for providing oscillations of about 4 megahertz, is operatively connected to microcontroller 3802 in a conventional manner.
      <br/>
      External oscillator 3806 is used to generate the internal timing signals used by the microcontroller.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a dual in-line pin (DIP) switch package 3856 is preferably operatively connected to microcontroller 3802.
      <br/>
      DIP switch package 3856 preferably includes multiple single-pole single-throw (SPST) switches in the same package, with each individual switch electrically connected to a different microcontroller input.
      <br/>
      Preferably, pull-up resistors 3858 may be connected from the individual microcontroller inputs (used to select a lamp running current) to the positive five volt DC supply.
      <br/>
      This insures that the microcontroller 3802 inputs are not "floating" when any of switches 3856 are in the "off" (i.e., open circuit) position.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, pull-down resistors may be operatively connected from each microcontroller 3802 input to the negative DC supply (i.e., ground), as appreciated by one skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      The position or state (i.e., "on" or "off") of the individual switches 3856 preferably enables a user to select a desired lamp run current.
      <br/>
      The resolution of the change in lamp current will generally depend upon the number of input lines to the microcontroller 3802.
      <br/>
      It is to be appreciated that DIP switches 3856 may be replaced by individual jumpers, which can be selectively configured to provide the desired lamp run current in a similar manner.
      <br/>
      An external momentary SPST switch 3860 is preferably operatively connected to microcontroller 3802 for generating a microcontroller reset signal.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the circuit could be reset by removing and then re-applying power to the circuit.

      As described above with reference to FIG. 38, the drive circuit of the present invention preferably includes a current sense transformer 3724', such as Thomson core T-2000A-A4 or equivalent.
      <br/>
      The current transformer 3724' is preferably electrically connected so that its primary winding is in series with the lamp 3726'. A sense current proportional to the lamp current will be induced in the secondary winding of transformer 3724'. This sense current may preferably be rectified by, for example, a conventional full-wave bridge rectifier circuit 3722' having a simple capacitor-input filter (e.g., a 4.7  MU F capacitor and a 100 ohm resistor connected in parallel across the bridge rectifier output terminals).
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      It may be preferable to provide additional low pass filtering in order to substantially remove any remaining high frequency components present in the sense current.
      <br/>
      A simple single-pole low pass filter preferably includes a resistor 3862, connected in series between the output of bridge rectifier circuit 3722' and the embedded analog-to-digital converter (ADC) input of microcontroller 3802, and a capacitor 3864, connected between the ADC input and the negative voltage supply (i.e., ground).
      <br/>
      As known by those skilled in the art, the half-power (i.e., -3 dB) frequency will be determined by the values of resistor 3862 and capacitor 3864 according to the equation p=1/(RC), where p is the half-power frequency (in radians per second, rad/s), R is the value of series resistor 3862 (in ohms,  OMEGA ) and C is the value of shunt capacitor 3864 (in Farads, F).
      <br/>
      Preferably, resistor 3862 is selected to be about 4.7 K OMEGA  and capacitor 3864 is selected to be about 22  MU F, thus establishing a -3 dB point of about 1.5 Hertz. Although only a simple low-pass filter is illustrated in FIGS. 40A-40D, the present invention similarly contemplates other suitable low pass filter arrangements which may be employed.

    <p num="164">Referring now to FIGS. 41A-41E, there is shown an alternative embodiment of the exemplary circuit illustrated in FIGS. 40A-40D, with like components receiving the same reference designation numbers as in FIGS. 40A-40D. In this alternative embodiment, the circuitry is essentially the same as the drive circuit depicted in FIGS. 40A-40D, with the primary exception of the current-sensing circuitry.</p>
    <p num="165">
      As shown in FIGS. 41A-41E, the current sense transformer 3724' and associated rectification circuitry 3722' of FIGS. 40A-40D are preferably replaced by some additional smaller, less expensive components.
      <br/>
      Rather than employing an expensive transformer to perform the current sense function, the drive circuit of FIGS. 41A-41E preferably uses a current sense resistor 3904 connected between the negative output terminal of the H-bridge 3924, formed at the junction of the source terminals of FET devices 3718' and 3720', and the negative voltage supply line 3740'. Preferably, a very low value of resistance (e.g., about one ohm, 1/2 watt) is used for current sense resistor 3904.
      <br/>
      A low resistance value insures that the differential voltage developed across sense resistor 3904 does not grow too large when the lamp current is high.
    </p>
    <p num="166">
      Additional circuitry 3902, the operation of which will be discussed herein below, is also preferably provided to measure at least a portion of the voltage developed across sense resistor 3904.
      <br/>
      This voltage, which is representative of the current flowing through lamp 3726', is preferably fed to the analog-to-digital converter embedded in microcontroller 3802 to monitor and maintain the user-defined lamp current (set by switches 3856), as described above with reference to FIGS. 40A-40D.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      With continued reference to FIGS. 41A-41E, in order to accurately measure the voltage generated across sense resistor 3904, the two connection points 3924, 3740' of resistor 3904 are preferably electrically connected to the negative and positive inputs, respectively, of an operational amplifier (op-amp) 3910 via series input resistors 3918 and 3922.
      <br/>
      Operational amplifier 3910 is preferably configured as a conventional differential voltage subtracter-multiplier circuit having a feedback resistor 3912, connected between the negative (inverting) input and the output of op-amp 3910, and having a common-mode resistor 3920, connected between the positive (non-inverting) input and positive five volt source (generated at the output of five volt regulator 3814).
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      The voltage subtracter-multiplier is a basic circuit for forming the difference of voltages.
      <br/>
      With reference to FIGS. 41A-41E, it is to be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the voltage produced at the output of operational amplifier (op-amp) 3910 will be the analog representation of a scaled value of the voltage present at the inverting (-) input of op-amp 3910 subtracted from a scaled value of the voltage present at the non-inverting (+) input of the op-amp 3910.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      Preferably, feedback resistor 3912 is of the same value as common-mode resistor 3920, and the two series input resistors 3918, 3922 are preferably the same value as each other.
      <br/>
      This simplifies the op-amp output voltage equation by allowing the multiplying constants for the two input voltages of the op-amp to be essentially the same.
      <br/>
      The value of the multiplying constant will be primarily determined by a ratio of the value of feedback resistor 3912 to the value of input resistor 3918 (or similarly, the value of resistor 3920 divided by the value of resistor 3922).
      <br/>
      This multiplying constant may be appropriately chosen so as to provide a sense voltage in the operable range of the analog-to-digital converter utilized in the drive circuit.
      <br/>
      Preferably, resistors 3912 and 3920 are chosen to have a value of 80.6K ohms with a tolerance of one percent (1%), and input resistors 3918, 3922 are chosen to have a value of 10K ohms with a tolerance of one percent (1%).
      <br/>
      This results in a multiplying factor (i.e., gain) of about 8.06.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      It is preferred that the voltage developed across sense resistor 3904 be filtered to substantially remove any high frequency components that are present in the sense current prior to being fed to the voltage subtracter-multiplier circuit.
      <br/>
      For the drive circuit shown in FIGS. 41A-41E, a simple single-pole low pass filter network is preferably used, comprising a series-connected resistor 3914 and a shunt capacitor 3916.
      <br/>
      The values of resistor 3914 and capacitor 3916 are preferably chosen to provide the desired -3 dB corner (i.e., pole) frequency for the low pass filter, as previously described above.
      <br/>
      In the drive circuit of FIG. 41, a resistor value of about 4.7K ohms and a capacitor value of about 10  MU F were chosen to establish a -3 dB corner frequency of about 3 Hertz.
      <br/>
      Although a simple single-pole low pass filter is preferred, any low pass filter circuit which substantially removes the high frequency components of the sense current may be used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      Various suitable low-pass filter arrangements are known by those skilled in the art and are presented in such texts as Analog Filter Design, by M. E. Van Valkenburg, published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1982. A detailed discussion of low pass filters will, therefore, not be provided herein.
    </p>
    <p num="171">
      In order to isolate the microcontroller from the fluorescent lamp and any remote control signals, an isolation circuit 3908, such as manufacturer part number HCPL7840, or an equivalent thereof, may be operatively connected between sense resistor 3914 and op-amp 3910.
      <br/>
      It may also be preferable to provide a separate five volt regulated DC voltage supply 3906, such as manufacturer part number 7805 or equivalent.
      <br/>
      When isolation is employed, the gain of the differential subtracter-multiplier circuit is preferably unity, and thus resistors 3912 and 3920 are chosen to be a value substantially equal to input resistors 3918, 3922 (i.e., 10K ohms).
      <br/>
      Where the accuracy of the multiplying constant (i.e., gain) is critical, the gain-determining resistors 3912, 3918, 3920 and 3922 will preferably have a tolerance of one percent (1%) or less to insure superior matching.
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      As illustrated in FIGS. 41A-41E, a resistor network 3926 may preferably be employed as a means of conserving valuable printed circuit board space.
      <br/>
      Resistor network 3926 may be manufactured as a plurality of individual resistors, each preferably having the same resistance value, combined, for example, in a conventional dual in-line pin (DIP) package.
      <br/>
      For the exemplary drive circuit of FIGS. 41A-41E, resistor network 3926 preferably comprises eight 15K ohm resistors.
      <br/>
      It is to be appreciated that when resist or network 3926 is employed, series current limiting resistors 3850 and pull-up resistors 3858, shown in FIGS. 40, may be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="173">It should also be noted that in all of the embodiments of the invention set forth herein, the invention extends both to the assembly of the various components together with the fluorescent lightbulb (or other assembly of translucent housing, and fluorescent medium), as well as to the components without the fluorescent lightbulb, configured in a fashion to receive a fluorescent lightbulb from another source.</p>
    <p num="174">
      With particular reference again to FIG. 36, it should be noted that any of the apparatuses disclosed herein, whether preheat, rapid start, or instant start, which are utilized with AC, may benefit from the use of a low pass filter 3562.
      <br/>
      Such a filter can be located in series with the input power line (e.g., the "hot" lead) to correct the power factor and to improve total harmonic distortion by suppressing spurious harmonic transmission into the power lines.
      <br/>
      One preferred form of low pass filter 3562 includes a small inductive reactance, preferably on the order of millihenries.
      <br/>
      For example, using a four foot T12 lamp, a power factor of about 0.99 and a total harmonic distortion (THD) of about ten percent (10%) was achieved by placing an inductor of approximately 240 mH in series with the "hot" lead of the AC input.

    <p num="175">Example 1</p>
    <p num="176">
      An inductive-resistive fluorescent apparatus was constructed in accordance with FIGS. 4 and 5.
      <br/>
      Bulb 68 was a General Electric 20 watt 24 inch (61 cm) preheat type kitchen and bath bulb model number F20T12.KB. A McMaster-Carr number 1623K1 starter bulb was employed.
      <br/>
      An inductive-resistive structure was assembled in the form of a conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly 58 as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The assembly had a length of 24 inches (61 cm) and a width of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm).
      <br/>
      Substrate 78 was in the form of a 0.002 inch (0.05 mm) polyester film.
      <br/>
      One-eighth inch (3.2 mm) wide by 0.002 inch (0.05 mm) thick copper conductors 88, 96 were positioned with approximately 1.25 inches (3.2 cm) between their inside edges.
      <br/>
      They were then covered with a medium temperature conductive-resistive coating, to be discussed below, to a depth of 0.008 inches (0.2 mm) wet, which dried to a thickness of 0.004 inches (0.1 mm).
      <br/>
      The thicknesses refer to the total height of the coating 114 above the top surface of the substrate 78.
      <br/>
      The goal was to achieve a nominal DC resistance of 200 Ohms between the conductors 88, 96.
    </p>
    <p num="177">
      Structure 58 was maintained about 3/32 inch (2.4 mm) from the bulb and was run on a nominal 60 Hz 120 VAC line current which had an actual measured value of 117.8 VAC. Once the bulb had started, a voltage drop of 61 VAC was measured across the bulb.
      <br/>
      The bulb would not start unless maintained in proximity to the conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly.
      <br/>
      However, once it was started, it could be removed from the region of the assembly and would remain illuminated.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is believed that the conductive-resistive medium and substrate assembly aids in starting the bulb by means of an electromagnetic (e.g., magnetic and/or electrostatic) field interaction with the bulb, and also acts as a series impedance to absorb excess voltage during steady-state operation of the bulb.
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      The conductive-resistive medium was prepared as follows.
      <br/>
      A slurry was formed consisting of 97.95 parts by weight water, 58.84 parts by weight ethyl alcohol, and 48.80 parts by weight GP-38 graphite 200-320 mesh as sold by the McMaster-Carr supply Company, P.O. Box 440, New Brunswick, N.J. 08903-0440. 52.38 parts by weight of polyvinyl acetate 17-156 heater emulsion, available from Camger Chemical Systems, Inc. of 364 Main Street, Norfolk, Mass. 02056, were blended into the aforementioned slurry.
      <br/>
      Finally, 35.09 parts by weight of China Clay available from the Albion Kaolin Company, 1 Albion Road, Hephzibah, Ga. 30815 were added to the blended slurry mixture.
      <br/>
      The mixture was then applied to the substrate and allowed to dry, leaving an emulsion of graphite and china clay dispersed in polyvinyl acetate polymer.

      Another example was constructed in accordance with FIGS. 4 and 5, and using a conventional fluorescent fixture with the ballast removed.

      The metal of the housing 126 was ferromagnetic.

The bulb was a circular "Lights of America" FC8T9/WW/RS preheat type, with only one pin at each end of the bulb connected.
      <br/>
      The main inductive-resistive structure 1148 was a 1/2 inch wide strip of conductive-resistive material (the same composition as in Example 1) which was painted directly on the light in order to obtain a nominal 50 Ohm DC resistance between the 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) wide copper conductors, which were located essentially adjacent the side edges of the strip of conductive material.

      The material was painted over essentially the entire circumference of the circular fluorescent lightbulb.

The bulb was a Philips Econ-O-Watt FB40CW/6/EW 40 watt u-shaped preheat type, with only one pin at each end connected.
