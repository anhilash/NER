      2-Ethoxy-4-�N-+1-(2-piperidino-phenyl)-3-methyl-1-butyl}-aminocarbonylmethyl�-benzoic acid, is also obtained in other solid forms when it is crystallized from other solvents or mixtures of solvents.
      <br/>
      Form (B), which has a melting point of 140 (degree)  to 142 (degree)  C., is obtained by crystallization from an ethanol/water mixture.
      <br/>
      The foamy form (C), which has a melting point range from 75 (degree)  to 85 (degree)  C., is obtained from the 1:1 methanol adduct (melting point: 85 (degree)  to 90 (degree)  C.), which occurs upon crystallization from methanol, by heating at 60 (degree)  C. in vacuo (5 Torr) over phosphorous pentoxide, whereby the methanol is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="674">
      In the dissolved state those forms are identical, as is evident from the corresponding solution spectra, for instance the IR-spectra in methylene chloride shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 of the attached drawings.
      <br/>
      However, in the solid state, the three forms differ in their melting characteristics and their solid spectra, for instance as shown by the corresponding IR-KBr-spectra in FIGS. 4, 5 and 6 of the attached drawings.
    </p>
    <p num="675">In order to measure infra-red absorption, forms (A), (B) and (C) were dissolved in methylene chloride (40 mg of substance per ml of methylene chloride), or intimately triturated with potassium bromide and then compressed hydraulically to form a tablet (approx. 1 mg of substance/300 mg of KBr).</p>
    <p num="676">In the case of the solutions, the IR-spectra were measured with an IR-spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Type 299) in a cell of sodium chloride (layer thickness 0.2 mm) by comparison with a pure methylene chloride solution and, in the case of the potassium bromide tablets, with an IR-spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Type 298) by comparison with air.</p>
    <p num="677">
      The three solid forms can be conveyed into one another by suitable recrystallization and drying.
      <br/>
      Thus, the low-melting-point form (A) is obtained by recrystallizing the high-melting-point form (B) from acetone/petroleum ether and the high-melting-point form (B) is obtained by recrystallizing the low-melting-point form (A) from ethanol/water.
      <br/>
      By recrystallizing the high-melting-point form (B) from methanol, a 1:1 adduct with methanol is obtained, and from this the foamy form (C) is obtained by removing the methanol.
    </p>
    <p num="678">
      Irrespective of the particular process which is used to synthesize 2-Ethoxy-4-�N-}1-(2-piperidino-phenyl)-3-methyl-1-butyl}-aminocarbonylmethyl�-benzoic acid, therefore, the heat-melting-point or low-melting-point or foamy form can be obtained, as desired, by a suitable choice of solvent or mixture of solvents during crystallization and by suitable drying.
      <br/>
      This is important in the practical use of the solid forms, whether or not they are accompanied by galenic excipients in pharmaceutical compositions, particularly for lowering blood sugar in the treatment of Type II diabetes; this is because different solid forms may have different shelf lives and/or different absorption characteristics in vivo and may thus give a different pattern of biological activity.

    <p num="679">2-Ethoxy-4-�N-+1-(2-piperidino-phenyl)-3-methyl-1-butyl}-aminocarbonylmethyl�-benzoic acid may be obtained by the methods described hereinabove, but preferably by reacting 3-methyl-1-(2-piperidino-phenyl)-1-butylamine with a compound of the formula  (Chemical Structure image '18' not included in text)</p>

    <p num="682">
      The reaction is advantageously carried out in a solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, benzene, toluene, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide, optionally in the presence of an acid-activating agent or a dehydrating agent, for instance in the presence of ethyl chloroformate, thionyl chloride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentoxide, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide, N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole, N,N'-thionyldiimidazole or triphenylphosphine/carbon tetrachloride, or in the presence of an amino group activating agent, such as phosphorus trichloride, and optionally in the presence of an inorganic base such as sodium carbonate or a teritary organic base such as triethylamine or pyridine, which may simultaneously serve as solvent, at temperatures between -25 (degree)  and 250 (degree)  C., but preferably at temperatures between -10 (degree)  C. and the boiling point of the solvent which is used.
      <br/>
      The reaction may also be carried out without a solvent, and any water formed during the reaction may be removed by azeotropic distillation, for instance by heating with toluene, using a water trap, or by adding a drying agent such as magnesium sulfate or a molecular sieve.
    </p>
    <p num="683">The subsequent removal of the protective group is preferably carried out by hydrolysis, either in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric or trichloroacetic acid, or in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, in a suitable solvent such as water, methanol, methanol/water, ethanol, ethanol/water, water/isopropanol or water/dioxane at temperatures between -10 (degree)  and 120 (degree)  C., for instance at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling point of the reaction mixture.</p>
    <p num="684">A tert.butyl protective group may also be removed thermally, optionally in an inert solvent such as methylene, chloride, chloroform, benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, and preferably in the presence of a catalytic quantity of an acid such as p-toluenesulfonic, sulfuric, phosphoric or polyphosphoric acid.</p>
    <p num="685">Moreover, a benzyl protective group may also be removed by hydrogenation in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such as palladium-on-charcoal in a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethanol/water, glacial acetic acid, ethyl acetate, dioxane or dimethylformamide.</p>
    <p num="686">The subsequent crystallization is carried out in sutu from the reaction mixture containing ethanol/water or, as a final recrystallization, by dissolving the reaction product in a mixture of ethanol and water, optionally while heating, and cooling, optionally accompanied by trituration and/or seeding (form B), or by dissolving the reaction product in acetone and adding petroleum ether (form A), or by dissolving the reaction product, optionally while heating in methanol, subsequent cooling of the solution accompanied by trituration and/or seeding, and heating the isolated solid methanol adducts, preferably in vacuo, in the presence of a drying agent such as phosphorus pentoxide (form C).</p>
