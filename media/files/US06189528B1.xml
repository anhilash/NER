      A portable grill easily carried as components, which may be stacked as generally flat parts, to be carried in a compact container, and may be easily assembled without tools and used in various modes.
      <br/>
      Upper and lower reflectors which are flat rectangular parts when disassembled, are flexed and held in arcuate shapes upon assembly, to form the cooker lid and body, respectively, by rods that engage the edges of the reflectors and mount in holes in the legs.
      <br/>
      After use, the cooker may be disassembled and transported again.
      <br/>
      By installing, removing and substituting various parts, the cooking unit may be used as, for example, a grill, a baker, a boiler, a smoker, a steamer, a deep fryer and the like.
      <br/>
      Provision is made for propane as well as charcoal, wood and other consumable fuels.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention relates generally to a cooking system and, more particularly, to a versatile outdoor cooking system which permits rapid assembly and disassembly for easy storage and transportation</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Cooking outdoors is well-known and many system's have been developed to facilitate cooking outdoors.
      <br/>
      However, the systems that are available either are limited in desirable features or, if they are provided with many desirable features, are heavy and cumbersome to store and difficult to transport, for example, by one hiking through a wilderness area.
    </p>
    <p num="3">Therefore, what is needed is a lightweight outdoor cooking system which provides desirable features and which may also be easily stored and readily transported.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Many available systems are inefficient by design.
      <br/>
      Deficiencies include:
    </p>
    <p num="5">Inadequate draft control.</p>
    <p num="6">No fire grate.</p>
    <p num="7">No Combustion air control.</p>
    <p num="8">Open lid designs lose heat, do not reflect heat to food being cooked.</p>
    <p num="9">No radiant heat.</p>
    <p num="10">Not rain proof or wind proof.</p>
    <p num="11">Square shapes are less efficient than parabolic or semi circular shapes.</p>
    <p num="12">Painted surfaces absorb heat while unpainted aluminum reflects heat.</p>
    <p num="13">Grills with short legs may start grass fires.</p>
    <p num="14">Grills with short legs are inconvenient, requiring the user to stoop or squat.</p>
    <p num="15">No place to hang implements.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention, accordingly, provides a system for cooking outdoors which permits rapid assembly and disassembly with the feature that when disassembled all the pieces lie flat for easy storage and transportation.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the system includes a number of additional features which enable it to be used in a number of different cooking modes as, for example, a grill, a baker, a boiler, a smoker, a steamer, a deep fat fryer, and the like.
      <br/>
      Some of these modes may be carried out simultaneously.
      <br/>
      A dutch oven may be utilized in the present invention, without a ground fire, and can be used despite rain or wind.
      <br/>
      Improved draft control makes possible starting of charcoal fire, even in rain, by positioning body and lid ends to control draft.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 1, the outdoor cooking system embodying features of the present invention is generally illustrated at 10.
      <br/>
      A body reflector 12 forms a portion of the body of the cooker, and another reflector 14 forms a portion of the lid assembly 15.
      <br/>
      A body end 16 at each end of reflector 12 closes the ends of the body portion of the cooker.
      <br/>
      Body end 16 lifts up to access fire or baking area below grill.
      <br/>
      Lid ends 18 and 19 (see FIG. 2) at each end of reflector 14 close the ends of lid 15 of the cooker.
      <br/>
      Rods 20 and 22 join and support reflector 12, as will be described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      Rods 28 and 30 join with and support reflector 14, as will be described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      Rod 20 also acts as a hinge pin about which lid 15 pivots for access to any heat source or food in the cooker.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Referring to FIG. 2, the cooker 10 is shown with the lid 15 open, showing lid end 19, without the cooking grill.</p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 3 shows an exploded parts relationship between some of the parts of cooker 10.
      <br/>
      Rods 20 and 22 insert through conduits formed in the edges of reflector 12 and into hole 44 in lid end 18 and a similar hole in lid end 19, not shown in FIG. 3, and into holes 32 and 34, respectively, in leg stand 24; and into holes 36 and 38, respectively, in leg 26.
      <br/>
      Rods 28 and 30 insert through conduits formed in the edges of reflector 14 and into holes 40 and 42 in lid end 18 and similar holes in lid end 19.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, lid ends 18 and 19 are identical.
      <br/>
