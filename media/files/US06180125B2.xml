      This invention comprises a one-phase cosmetic composition which is a clear stick or gel having low tack.
      <br/>
      The cosmetic sticks are formed as a one phase system by combining: (a) from 0.5-50 weight percent of a dimethicone copolyol ester compound soluble in propylene glycol; (b) from 50-99 weight percent of a gellant/solvent system; which comprises a mixture of: (i) 0.5-4.0 weight percent dibenzylidene sorbitol; (ii) 0.05-1.0 weight percent of a co-gellant or structural integrity enhancer; (iii) 0.1-80 weight percent of a solvent selected from the group consisting of polyhydric alcohols for example, propylene glycol; dipropylene glycol; tripropylene glycol; tetrapropylene glycol; PPG-10 butane diol; 1,3-butane diol; 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol; PEG-6; and PPG-425; optionally including up to 50 percent of other solvents selected from the group consisting of propylene carbonate, diisopropyl sebacate, methyl pyrrolidone, and ethyl alcohol as a substitute for a portion of the polyhydric alcohol component; and (c) an effective amount of at least one cosmetically active ingredient, for example, an antiperspirant active.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to cosmetic compositions in the form of solid sticks or gels, which are based on dibenzilidene sorbitol (DBS) as a gellant and a polyhydric alcohol such as propylene glycol (PG) as a solvent in combination with a selected dimethicone copolyol ester soluble in propylene glycol (PG).
      <br/>
      This invention relates to the use of these materials as anti-tack agents in solid cosmetic products such as deodorant and/or antiperspirant formulations, especially those which are clear.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Dibenzylidene sorbitol (also called dibenzaldehyde monosorbitol acetal, or dibenzyl monosorbitol acetal or dibenzylidene monosorbitol acetal) and derivatives thereof such as those which are substituted on one or both of the aromatic rings with a fluorine or methoxy group and those which have the sorbitol portion replaced with other reduced sugars such as xylitol or ribitol as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,609,855 assigned to Procter &amp; Gamble (collectively referred to as dibenzylidene sorbitol or "DBS") may be used in various food and cosmetic applications.
      <br/>
      For cosmetic uses the more interesting ones are those focused on obtaining a translucent or clear product.
      <br/>
      While dibenzylidene sorbitol is stable in alkaline or neutral media, such compounds are not stable in acidic media.
      <br/>
      In an acidic environment, such as in the presence of acidic antiperspirant materials, and in the presence of even small amounts of water, the dibenzylidene sorbitol deteriorates and breaks down.
      <br/>
      Also, the use of DBS sometimes causes problems in the aesthetics of cosmetic products or problems with structural properties.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there is a need to find a way to form products containing DBS which are stable and which have acceptable aesthetics.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The use of DBS in an antiperspirant formulation requires the inclusion of polyhydric alcohols such as propylene glycol as a solvent if a clear, transparent product is desired.
      <br/>
      The high propylene glycol content, when combined with aluminum salts which are included in antiperspirant compositions for wetness control, contribute to undesirable tackiness or a sticky feel for these products when applied to the axilla region of the body.
      <br/>
      Clear antiperspirant sticks were first formulated with DBS in the late 1970's.
      <br/>
      Since then there have been continued technical efforts to reduce the negative sensory attributes.
      <br/>
      Some of these efforts have focused on alternative solvents to replace a portion of the propylene glycol with organic esters known in the art as emollients.
      <br/>
      This creates a further problem since many of these emollients are either unsafe for personal care products or do not achieve acceptable aesthetics.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      For formulating personal care products the incorporation of silicone fluids is known in the art.
      <br/>
      Silicone fluids such as cyclosiloxanes (for example, DOW CORNING.RTM. 244 and 245 Fluids) are used in some major commercial products.
      <br/>
      Silicone fluids are used because of their low tackiness, superior glide and skin-feel properties.
      <br/>
      However, silicone fluids are difficult to introduce into DBS based cosmetic stick products such as antiperspirants because they are not good solvents for DBS and they are not readily compatible with propylene glycol and many organic esters or emollients.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Some of the efforts to overcome these problems are described as follows.
      <br/>
      For example, some efforts have focused on the stability of DBS.
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="41">The following and more particular description of the invention more fully explains the cosmetic compositions that can be made.</p>
    <p num="42">The dimethicone copolyol esters useful in this invention are those of Formula I:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="43">
      wherein each of R1 -R9 may be the same or different and are each independently selected from the group consisting of C1 -C4 straight chain alkyls (especially methyl) phenyl, and substituted phenyl groups wherein the substitution is a member selected from the group consisting of methyl and ethyl;
      <br/>
      R10 is selected from the group consisting of C1 -C20 linear and branched chain alkyls particularly C4 -C18 alkyls, more particularly C8 -C6 alkyls and especially linear C11 (laurate), all with or without unsaturations;
      <br/>
      a is a number in the range of 0-500, particularly 0-100, more particularly 1-20, and even more particularly 5-15;
      <br/>
      b is a number in the range of 1-100, particularly 1-50, more particularly 1-20, and even more particularly 2-6;
      <br/>
      x, y and z are each independently selected to be a number in the range of 0-20, with particular values of x, y, z each being in the range of 0-7, provided that at least one of x, y, and z is not equal to zero.
      <br/>
      It is to be recognized that a, b, x, y and z are average values (including whole numbers and fractions) and mixtures of compounds with each compound having different values for a, b, R1 -R9 and R10 may also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="44">In one particular set of compounds of Formula I, none of x, y, or z have a value of zero and each value of x, y, and z has an average value independently selected from the values 2, 3, and 4.</p>
    <p num="45">
      Specific examples of compounds of Formula I include:
      <br/>
      (a) linear polydimethylsiloxane where a=10, b=4, x=7, y=z=0, R10 =C11 ;
      <br/>
      (b) linear polydimethylsiloxane where a=10, b=4, x=3, y=2, z=4, and R10 =C11 ;
      <br/>
      (c) linear polydimethylsiloxane where a=10, b=4, x=4, y=2, z=3, R10 =C11 ;
      <br/>
      (d) linear polydimethylsiloxane where a=25, b=10, x=z=0, y=6, and R10 =C11-17 ;
      <br/>
      (e) mixtures of the particular compounds described in parts (a)-(d), and
      <br/>
      (f) two component mixtures of the particular compounds described in parts (a)-(d) wherein one component is 0.1-99.9% of the composition and the other component is the remainder to 100%.
    </p>
    <p num="46">For each of the groups listed as (a)-(d) above, particular examples of the compounds are when each of the R groups (R1 -R9) is selected to be methyl.</p>
    <p num="47">For any of the groups (a)-(d), one or more additional silicone fluids may be added, for example in amounts of 0.1-50%. Such additional fluids may be selected from the group consisting of (1) polyalkylene oxide modified polydimethylsiloxanes (for example, products sold under the designations SILWET L-7600, SILWET L-7605, SILWET L-7657); (2) dimethicone copolyols (for example, products sold under the designations SILWET L-7200, SILWET L-7644); and (3) dimethicone copolyol methyl ether (for example, a product sold under the designation SILWET L-7087), where such SILWET products are available from Witco, located in West Virginia.</p>
    <p num="48">
      For the compounds of Formula I to be used with this invention, some of the compounds of Formula I may be obtained from commercial sources and others are described in the literature.
      <br/>
      A description of selected dimethicone copolyol esters and methods of making such esters used in this invention may be found in the literature, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,136,063 assigned to Siltech Inc., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
      <br/>
      While this family of compounds is generally named dimethicone copolyol esters, other names for these compounds are silicone fatty esters, silicone waxes.
      <br/>
      Trade names for such compounds of Formula I include the Silwax WSL series and are commercially available from Lambent Inc., Norcross, Ga.
      <br/>
      As noted above, compounds of Formula I can be used with or without additional silicone compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The co-gellant or structural integrity enhancer is selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropyl cellulose, alkyl ester thickeners (for example, PEG-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate called CROTHIX.RTM. from Croda Chemicals, Parsippany, N.J.) fumed silica (for example, Cab-O-Sil.RTM., from Cabot, Flemington, N.J.; Aerosil.RTM. from DeGussa, Ridgefield Park, N.J.), waxes such as alkyl methylsiloxanes (for example, AMS-30 (C30-C45 alkyl methicone available from DOW CORNING CORPORATION, Midland, Mich.), selected guars such as an hydroxy C3 -C4 alkyl guar having a level of hydroxyalkylation of 0.4-1.5 molar substitution as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,895,644. Hydroxypropyl cellulose may be used in an amount of 0.05-1.0% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.
      <br/>
      Other co-gellants may be used in similar amounts, that is, in the range of 0.05-2.0% by weight based on the entire weight of the composition.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Various antiperspirant active materials that can be utilized according to the present invention include conventional aluminum and aluminum/zirconium salts, as well as aluminum/zirconium salts complexed with a neutral amino acid such as glycine, as known in the art.
      <br/>
      See each of EP Application No. 512 770 A1 and PCT No. WO 92/19221, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, for disclosure of antiperspirant active materials.
      <br/>
      The antiperspirant active materials disclosed therein, including the acidic antiperspirant materials, can be incorporated in the compositions of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Suitable materials include (but are not limited to) aluminum chlorohydroxide, aluminum chloride, aluminum sesquichlorohydroxide, zirconyl hydroxychloride, and aluminum chlorohydrol-propylene glycol complex.
      <br/>
      These include, by way of example (and not of a limiting nature), aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum chloride, aluminum sesquichlorohydrate, zirconyl hydroxychloride, aluminum-zirconium glycine complex (for example, aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex gly, aluminum zirconium pentachlorohydrex gly, aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly and aluminum zirconium octochlorohydrex gly), aluminum chlorohydrex PG, aluminum chlorohydrex PEG, aluminum dichlorohydrex PG, and aluminum dichlorohydrex PEG.
      <br/>
      The aluminum-containing materials can be commonly referred to as antiperspirant active aluminum salts.
      <br/>
      Generally, the foregoing metal antiperspirant active materials are antiperspirant active metal salts.
      <br/>
      In the embodiments which are antiperspirant compositions according to the present invention, such compositions need not include aluminum-containing metal salts, and can include other antiperspirant active materials, including other antiperspirant active metal salts.
      <br/>
      Generally, Category I active antiperspirant ingredients listed in the Food and Drug Administration's Monograph on antiperspirant drugs for over-the-counter human use can be used.
      <br/>
      In addition, any new drug, not listed in the Monograph, such as aluminum nitratohydrate and its combination with zirconyl hydroxychlorides and nitrates, or aluminum-stannous chlorohydrates, can be incorporated as an antiperspirant active ingredient in antiperspirant compositions according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      Preferred antiperspirant actives that can be incorporated in the compositions of the present invention include the enhanced efficacy aluminum salts and the enhanced efficacy zirconium/aluminum salt-glycine materials, having enhanced efficacy due to improved molecular distribution, known in the art and discussed, for example, in PCT No. WO 92/19221, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.
    </p>
    <p num="51">A particular group of antiperspirant actives of interest include those selected from the group consisting of aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum-zirconium glycine complex (for example, aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex gly, aluminum zirconium pentachlorohydrex gly, aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly), aluminum chlorohydrex PG, and aluminum chlorohydrex PEG.</p>
    <p num="52">
      The amount of antiperspirant active material incorporated in the stick composition of the present invention is, preferably, an antiperspirant effective amount; that is, an amount to reduce the flow of perspiration from the location (for example, axillary region of a human) to which the antiperspirant is applied.
      <br/>
      For deodorant products a level of from 0.5-20%, more particularly 0.5-5.0% by weight based on the entire weight of the composition is used.
      <br/>
      For an antiperspirant product an amount of 5.0-25%, particularly 5-20%, even more particularly 7-15% by weight based on the total weight of the composition may be used.
      <br/>
      The amount of antiperspirant material utilized is dependent on the efficacy of the specific antiperspirant material, as well as a maximum amount which avoids a reduction in clarity of the final product.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      A separate category of antiperspirant actives include those which are more experimental in nature and not yet included in the aluminum containing materials listed above (both Monograph approved and non-Monograph approved).
      <br/>
      These are called "low dose antiperspirant actives" herein and may be substituted for the Monograph type antiperspirant actives, but in much lower amounts such as in the range of 0.0001-10%. These low dose antiperspirant actives may be selected from the group consisting of (a) 0.5-10% formaldehyde derivatives such as methenamine, methenamine mandelate and methenamine hippurate; and (b) 0.0001-1% (with higher amounts in the 0.5-1% range being dosed via time released mechanisms for safety reasons) of anticholinergics (for example, H1-histamine blockers).
      <br/>
      In antiperspirant compositions the methenamine derivatives degrade slowly to formaldehyde, but the level of formaldehyde never reaches a point of skin irritation.
      <br/>
      These methenamine derivatives can be added in amounts in the range of 0.5-10% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.
      <br/>
      Another class of compounds are the anticholinergic compounds which act on the nervous system, specifically on the sympathetic cholinergic fibers of the eccrine sweat glands.
      <br/>
      Compounds such as H1-histamine blockers have an antiperspirant effect via an anticholinergic effect.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable anticholinergic agents include methscopolamine bromide, scopolamine hydrobromide, and N-methyl-4-piperidinyl alpha-benzoyloxy-alpha-cyclopentylphenylacetate salts.
      <br/>
      The anticholinergics can be used in amounts in the range of 0.0001-1% by weight based on the weight of the entire composition, with amounts in the 0.5-1% range being dosed via time released compositions for safety reasons.
      <br/>
      Such time released vehicles are described, for example, in Transdermal Control Systemic Medications by Yie W. Chien (Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, N.Y.).

    <p num="61">
      A desired feature of the present invention is that a clear, or transparent, cosmetic composition, (for example, a clear or transparent deodorant or antiperspirant composition) can be provided.
      <br/>
      The term clear or transparent according to the present invention is intended to connote its usual dictionary definition; thus, a clear, for example, stick or gel antiperspirant composition of the present invention allows ready viewing of objects behind it.
      <br/>
      By contrast, a translucent composition, although allowing light to pass through, causes the light to be scattered so that it will be impossible to see clearly objects behind the translucent composition.
      <br/>
      An opaque composition does not allow light to pass through.
      <br/>
      Within the context of the present invention, a gel or stick is deemed to be transparent or clear if the maximum transmittance of light of any wavelength in the range 400-800 nm through a sample 1 cm thick is at least 35%, preferably at least 50%.
      <br/>
      The gel or stick is deemed translucent if the maximum transmittance of such light through the sample is between 2% and less than 35%.
      <br/>
      A gel or stick is deemed opaque if the maximum transmittance of light is less than 2%.
      <br/>
      The transmittance can be measured by placing a sample of the aforementioned thickness into a light beam of a spectrophotometer whose working range includes the visible spectrum, such as a Bausch &amp; Lomb Spectronic 88 Spectrophotometer.
      <br/>
      As to this definition of clear, see European Patent Application No. 291 334 A2.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to the present invention, there are differences between transparent (clear), translucent and opaque compositions.
    </p>
    <p num="62">Particular embodiments of the invention which may be used are antiperspirant sticks having formulations which are at least translucent.</p>
    <p num="63">Because of the chemical instability of DBS in the presence of water in low pH media, it is preferred that antiperspirant formulations be essentially anhydrous and contain sufficient buffering agents to keep the pH in the range of 4.0-5 0 (slashed zero)  Deodorants and other cosmetic preparations which are at a higher pH do not require this restriction.</p>

    <p num="72">
      As noted above, the compositions of the present invention have less tack than conventional cosmetic sticks.
      <br/>
      This is especially true of antiperspirant sticks made according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Tack can be evaluated by various techniques including the Forearm Flex Test.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Forearm Flex Test--In this test the administrator first over-wraps the test products to hide their identity from the panelists and then gives each sample a code number to hide their identity from the statistician who will analyze the data.
      <br/>
      These precautions are done to avoid bias of the panelists and the test evaluators.
      <br/>
      Next, one of two products is applied to one arm at the crease of the elbow and the second product is applied to the same area of the other arm.
      <br/>
      The two products are applied in a similar manner.
      <br/>
      Product application is done by either counting the number of strokes or by weighing the products to be tested before and after.
      <br/>
      Products are applied in random fashion to eliminate left-handed or right-handed biases.
      <br/>
      The ambient room temperature and humidity are recorded.
      <br/>
      Using the same control product for every test allows for a comparison between test results for various experimental formulations.
      <br/>
      The panelists evaluate the tested products for several aesthetic attributes including, but not limited to, wetness, oily/greasy feel, glide, and, most importantly, tackiness/stickiness.
      <br/>
      The panelists evaluate initial tackiness immediately after a product application and repeatedly at predetermined time intervals for an overall time of 90 minutes.
      <br/>
      The assessment of tack is made by flexing the arm and judging the adherent forces between contacted skin surfaces.
      <br/>
      A scale of 1 to 7 is used by each panelist with 1=Not Tacky and 7=Extremely Tacky.
      <br/>
      The collected data is used to generate a "Tack Profile" which is a plot of Tackiness versus Time.
      <br/>
      Data analysis using a statistical software package called JMP from SAS Institute (Cary, N.C.) permits identification of products, which are significantly different from the Control sample.
      <br/>
      The Control is selected to be a competitive benchmark currently in the marketplace, which represents what is believed to be the best commercially available standard.
      <br/>
      In addition to an analysis of product performance at specific time periods, the performance of the tested sample throughout the 90 minute test period can be made by calculating the area under each curve in the Tack Profile graph and comparing the differences.

      The following Examples are given as illustrative of the invention but other modifications may be made by those skilled in the art which are within the spirit and scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Unless otherwise noted all amounts are in weight percents.
      <br/>
      All chemical symbols and scientific abbreviations have their usual and customary meanings and all temperatures are in degrees C. The aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex glycine complex listed in the following examples is a solution comprising about 28% by weight actives in a mixture of polyhydric alcohols (such as Westchlor.RTM. A2Z 4105 from Westwood Chemical, Middletown, N.Y.).
      <br/>
      In addition about 2-8%, particularly 3-4% by weight zinc glycinate was added to the actives solution.
      <br/>
      It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that preheating of ingredients was done as needed to ensure good mixing.
    </p>
    <p num="75">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="76">
      As a general procedure for making clear antiperspirant/deodorant sticks, the following procedure can be used.
      <br/>
      Propylene glycol is weighed out into a main container.
      <br/>
      Hydroxypropyl cellulose is weighed out and sprinkled into the main container with mixing at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Mixing is continued for 10 minutes with high speed stirring but no splashing.
      <br/>
      Tripropylene glycol and a dimethicone copolyol ester (SILWAX WSL) are each weighed out and each added to the main mixture.
      <br/>
      The DBS is weighed out and gradually added to the mixture with mixing.
      <br/>
      Mixing is continued at room temperature for 10 minutes with high speed stirring but no splashing.
      <br/>
      The mixture is heated to a temperature of 110-115 degrees C. with continued mixing until the solution is clear and bright.
      <br/>
      A solution of the cosmetically active ingredient in propylene glycol is weighed out separately and heated to 97 degrees C. Stearyl alcohol is weighed out and added to the main mixture once the mixture is clear.
      <br/>
      Note that if DC 2501 is used as an emollient, preheating of this material is done to melt it first before addition to the mixture.
      <br/>
      Mixing is continued until the solution is again clear.
      <br/>
      The emollient is weighed out, added to the main batch, and mixing is continued until the solution is clear.
      <br/>
      The batch is cooled to 100 degrees C. The active ingredient is slowly added to the batch and mixed until the mixture is uniform.
      <br/>
      Fragrance is added to the main batch and the mixture is quickly cooled to 90-92 degrees C. The mixture is then quickly poured into the appropriate containers, for example, containers having dimensions of 3 cm (width at widest part of oval) * 6 cm (length of base) * 10 cm (height).
      <br/>
      If an emollient is added to the main batch shortly after the stearyl alcohol addition, the temperature drops close to 100 degrees C., so a slight adjustment may be needed to maintain the temperature at 105 degrees C.
