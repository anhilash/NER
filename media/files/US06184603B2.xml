    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">a) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a motor/generator unit having a motor/generator constructed so as to be enabled to give and receive a torque to and from rotary elements of a torque converter interposed between an engine and a transmission.</p>
    <p num="3">b) Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">Recently, in automotive vehicles, a fuel economy improvement has been demanded from standpoints of environment protection and limited resources.</p>
    <p num="5">
      One of techniques to improve the fuel economy includes a motor/generator installation in a vehicular engine driving force transmission system.
      <br/>
      For example, the motor/generator performs a regeneration such as to convert a running energy into an engine torque by means of an output torque of the motor/generator.

    <p num="9">
      The second previously proposed motor/generator unit has been applied to, so-called, a hybrid vehicle.
      <br/>
      The hybrid vehicle includes the engine, a clutch motor, and an assistance motor, drives of these engine and motors being controlled to be enabled to carry out efficient operations of the generation of the running energy, the power generation during the vehicular run, and the regeneration during the braking.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">In the first previously proposed motor/generator unit, a manual transmission has been used as a transmission although there are few modifications made to an already present and normally available power train.</p>
    <p num="11">In a case where the regeneration is started during a vehicular deceleration, a brake force corresponding to the regeneration is added to that corresponding to an engine braking so that the brake force accordingly becomes magnified and a disagreeable feeling of a vehicular drive is given to a vehicular driver.</p>
    <p num="12">In addition, in a case where the first previously proposed motor/generator unit is applied to a torque converter equipped automatic transmission which is major in current automotive vehicles as the transmission, a transmission of an input torque from a drive wheel side is not carried out between a turbine runner connected to an input axle of the transmission and a torque converter cover connected to an input axle of the engine so that it becomes impossible for the motor/generator to carry out the regeneration during the vehicular deceleration.</p>
    <p num="13">
      Furthermore, a starter to start the engine and an alternator to generate the electric power to be used in the vehicle are additionally required in the case of the application of the first previously proposed motor/generator unit to the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Hence, an increase in a vehicular weight is introduced This alternator always provides a load against the engine.
      <br/>
      Even if a voltage across the battery is sufficient, the power generation by the alternator is carried out.
      <br/>
      Hence, this arrangement described above gives a disadvantage to the improvement in fuel economy.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Furthermore, electrical parts to be mounted in the vehicle due to a demand of recent high-level technology have been increased.
      <br/>
      Together with the increase in the electrical parts, such a proposal that electromagnetic actuators are used to operate such vehicular air conditioner and power steering mechanism as those parts whose power has been obtained from the engine via its crankshaft and a belt has been made in order to improve the fuel economy.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a tendency of the increase in a vehicular battery load.
      <br/>
      To cope with the tendency of the increase in the vehicular battery load, it is expected that the battery voltage is increased from normal 12 volts to about 42 volts.
      <br/>
      Therefore, although it is necessary to increase a capacity of the alternator, it is unreasonable to increase the capacity of the alternator as separate from the motor/generator.
    </p>
    <p num="15">In addition, if the alternator having the large capacity is always operated by means of the engine, a fuel consumption becomes accordingly increased.</p>
    <p num="16">In the hybrid vehicle to which the second previously proposed motor/generator unit is applied, the drive of the engine, the clutch motor, and the assistance motor are controlled so that the vehicular run by means of the motor drive and the engine output torque assistance, and the generation and regeneration of the clutch motor and the assistance motor can efficiently be carried out.</p>
    <p num="17">However, in the hybrid vehicle to which the second previously proposed motor/generator unit is applied, the power train configuration is quite different from those having already present and normally available engine and transmission.</p>
    <p num="18">Hence, since it is impossible to utilize the already present and normally available power train and use a normally available assembly line, the second previously proposed motor/generator unit becomes extremely expensive.</p>
    <p num="19">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a novel and inexpensive motor/generator unit for an automotive vehicle which can utilize the already present and normally available power train, can utilize the already present and normally available production line, can eliminate both of the exclusively-used stator and alternator which would introduce a reduction of the fuel economy, and can improve a generation capacity and a regeneration ability.</p>
    <p num="20">The above-described object can be achieved by providing a motor/generator unit for an automotive vehicle, comprising: a torque converter to perform a transmission of a driving force between an output axle of a vehicular engine and an input axle of a transmission, the transmission being enabled to switch between a neutral state and a forward-and-rearward state and being enabled to vary a gear ratio; a housing enclosing a periphery of the torque converter; a hydraulic clutch; an electromagnetic clutch, both of the hydraulic clutch and electromagnetic clutch being juxtaposed to be enabled to form a lock-up state of the torque converter; and a motor/generator including a stator fixed to the housing and a rotor attached to a rotary element of the torque converter so as to be opposed to the stator, the motor/generator being disposed to be enabled to give and receive a torque to and from the rotary element of the torque converter.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="22">Reference will hereinafter be made to the drawings in order to facilitate a better understanding of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="23">FIG. 1 shows a basic concept of a motor/generator unit applicable to an automotive vehicle according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="24">
      As shown in FIG. 1, the motor/generator unit is interposed between an output axle of a vehicular engine and an input axle of a transmission.
      <br/>
      The motor/generator unit includes: a torque converter a to perform a transmission of a driving force between an output axle of a vehicular engine and an input axle of a transmission, the transmission being enabled to switch between a neutral state and a forward-and-rearward state and being enabled to vary a gear ratio; a housing c enclosing a periphery of the torque converter; a hydraulic clutch a2; an electromagnetic clutch a1, both of the hydraulic clutch and electromagnetic clutch being juxtaposed to be enabled to form a lock-up state of the torque converter; and a motor/generator b having a stator b1 fixed to an inner periphery of the housing and a rotor b2 attached to a rotary element of the torque converter a so as to be opposed to the stator, the motor/generator being disposed to be enabled to give and receive a torque to and from the rotary element of the torque converter a.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      When the engine is tried to be started, the motor/generator b is caused to function as an electric motor.
      <br/>
      In this case, when the motor/starter b is installed on the output axle of the engine to the clutches a1 and a2, the output axle of the engine is revolved by means of the motor/generator b irrespective of engagements or release of both clutches a1 and a2.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in a case where the motor/generator b is relatively disposed on the input axle of the transmission with respect to both clutches a1 and a2, a torque generated from the motor/generator b is transmitted to the output axle of the engine by the engagement of the electromagnetic clutch a1 to revolve the output axle of the engine.
      <br/>
      In this way, the motor/generator b is caused to revolve the output axle of the engine to start the engine.
      <br/>
      That is to say, the motor/generator b is caused to function as a generator to enable to be used as the alternator.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In addition, if it is functioned as the electric motor, the driving force of the engine can be assisted.
      <br/>
      In a case where, during the engine drive, the torque converter a is tried to be in the lock-up state, both hydraulic and electromagnetic clutch a2 and a1 are engaged.
      <br/>
      Thus, a high clutching force can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Furthermore, in a case where a power regeneration is carried out during the vehicular run, at least the electromagnetic clutch a1 is engaged.
      <br/>
      At this time, the torque is inputted to the motor/generator b so that the regeneration energy can be picked up.
    </p>
    <p num="28">On the other hand, in a case where the motor/generator b is relatively disposed on an input axle of the transmission with respect to both clutches a1 and a2, both engagements of the clutches a1 and a2 are released so that the drive wheel torque inputted from the input axle of the transmission can wholly be regenerated by means of the motor/generator b.</p>
    <p num="29">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="30">FIG. 2 shows a cross sectional view of the motor/generator unit 102 in a first preferred embodiment according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The motor/generator unit 102 is interposed between the output axle 13 of the engine 23 and the input axle 105a of the transmission 105.
      <br/>
      The engine 23 is driven, for example, with a gasoline (so-called, gasoline engine).
      <br/>
      A revolving force (torque) outputted from the crankshaft 18 of the engine 23 is outputted to the motor/generator unit 102 fixed as a side surface of the engine 23 via the engine output shaft 13.
      <br/>
      In addition, the transmission 105 is constituted by a continuously variable transmission.
      <br/>
      The (forward-rearward) transmission 105 is constituted by the forward-rearward switching section 103 including a planetary gear and a belt-pulley type transmission mechanism section 104.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The motor/generator unit 102 is divided into two mutually independent chambers by means of an outer housing 5 (which corresponds to the housing c shown in FIG. 1) and an inner housing 30.</p>
    <p num="33">
      One of the two chambers is a motor chamber 32 which is defined by the outer housing 5 and the inner housing 30.
      <br/>
      The motor/generator 102b which functions as the electric motor and generator (it is noted that, in each flowchart, the motor/generator 102b is denoted by STR/ALT) is disposed within the motor chamber 32.
      <br/>
      The torque converter 102a is disposed within the inner housing 30.
      <br/>
      A lock-up purpose electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c is disposed in the torque converter 102a.
    </p>
    <p num="34">The lock-up purpose electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c is constructed so as to carry out engagement and release operation in response to a power supply to a coil portion 16b and a power supply turn off thereto together with the engagement and release operations of a lock-up piston 16 in response to the hydraulic supply thereto and a hydraulic drainage.</p>
    <p num="35">It is noted that the operation of the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c by means of the hydraulic is executed by the same program as that on a lock-up condition as a conventional lock-up torque converter.</p>
    <p num="36">
      A torque converter cover 3 is linked to an oil pump drive axle 3a.
      <br/>
      A revolution of the converter cover 3 causes its revolving force to be inputted to the oil pump drive axle 3a so that a built-in oil pump 4 is driven to develop the hydraulic (oil pressure).
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      A space defined by the converter cover 3 and the inner housing 30 provides a dry chamber not to disturb the revolution of the converter cover 3.
      <br/>
      An oil seal 7 is disposed between an oil pump casing 30a and an oil pump drive axle 3a.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The inner housing 30 is fixedly supported on the engine 23.
      <br/>
      The oil pump casing 30a and a stator stationary axle 30b constitute the inner housing 30.
      <br/>
      The stator stationary axle 30b takes a hollow axis structure.
      <br/>
      A drive axle 17 is penetrated through the hollow axis structure and supported by the stator stationary axle 30b.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In addition, the oil pump drive axle 3a is rotatably supported on the stator stationary axle 30b.
      <br/>
      A stator blade 11 is fixedly supported via a one-way clutch 9.
      <br/>
      The stator blade 11 is not revolved in the same direction as the converter cover 3.
      <br/>
      However, when a torque due to the hydraulic is developed in the opposite direction to the converter cover 3, the stator blade 11 is supported on the one-way clutch 9 to be enabled to be revolved in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The drive axle 17 penetrated and supported on the stator stationary axle 30b is connected to a turbine runner 12 and the lock-up piston 16.
      <br/>
      The lock-up piston 16 is in a serration coupling to be enabled to be slid on the drive axle 17.
    </p>
    <p num="41">FIG. 3 shows an expanded cross sectional view of the serration coupling of the lock-up piston 16.</p>
    <p num="42">
      The lock-up piston 16 includes input plates 40 and an output plate 41.
      <br/>
      These two plates 40 and 41 are coupled together via a torsion spring 15.
      <br/>
      The two plates 40 and 41 are relatively and mutually pivoted to attenuate (absorb) a torsional vibration developed on the drive axle 17 and so forth.
    </p>
    <p num="43">A dish spring 38 and a frictional plate 37 are disposed between the input plates 40 and the output plate 41 to provide a hysteresis characteristic for the input torque during the relative pivotal movements of the two plates 40 and 41.</p>
    <p num="44">
      The serration coupling section limits expansion and contraction characteristics of the torsion spring 15 to which the two plates 40 and 41 are linked so that an abrupt torque variation can accurately be absorbed.
      <br/>
      The output plate 41 is in the serration coupling to the drive axle 17.
      <br/>
      The output plate 41 is held under a lock-up release state by means of a spring 39.
      <br/>
      An oil passage 22 is disposed within the drive axle 17.
      <br/>
      The oil passage 22 serves to adjust the oil pressure in an oil pressure chamber shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      This oil pressure causes the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c to generate a clutching force as a hydraulic lock-up clutch.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Referring back to FIG. 2, the drive axle 17 penetrates through the stator stationary axle 30a of the inner housing 30 and through the motor chamber 32.
      <br/>
      The motor chamber 32 provides a dry chamber not to disturb the revolution of the rotor 8.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      A rotor supporting member 8a is linked to a part of the drive axle 17 in the motor chamber 32.
      <br/>
      The drive of the drive axle 17 causes the rotor 8 of the motor/generator 102b installed on the rotor supporting member 8a to be revolved.
      <br/>
      In addition, the stator 1 of the motor/generator 102b is fixed on the outer housing 5.
      <br/>
      A fin 6 is attached onto the rotor supporting member 8a so that the revolution of the rotor supporting member 8a causes the rotor 8 and the stator 1 to be air cooled.
      <br/>
      The rotor supporting member 8a can secure a radial length of the rotor 8 and can position the rotor 8 at a radial outside of the torque converter 102a.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Hence, an axial length of the rotor 8 can be secured without a long extension of the axial length of the whole motor/generator unit 102.
      <br/>
      In addition, a capability of the motor/generator 102b as the motor and as the generator can highly be set.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      A power supply section 44 is installed on an outside of the outer housing 5 to supply or receive the power to or from the motor/generator 102b.
      <br/>
      The stator land the coil 2 are fixed along an inner peripheral surface of the outer housing 5.
      <br/>
      Although a specific reference numeral is described in FIG. 2, a jacket to perform a heat pipe cooling in a passage of which water or cooling medium is passed is installed on a fixed contact surface between the outer housing 5 and the stator 1.
    </p>
    <p num="49">The drive axle 17 penetrates through the outer housing 5 and is integrally linked to the input axle 105a of the transmission 105.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The forward-rearward switching mechanism 103 is constituted by the planetary gear.
      <br/>
      The forward-rearward switching section 103 includes a ring gear 25, a clutch 29 disposed within the ring gear 25, a pinion gear 26, a clutch 28 to fix the pinion gear 26, and the sun gear 27 linked to the rotary axle 33.
      <br/>
      The driving force transmitted from the drive axle 17 is transmitted from the drive axle 17 and is transmitted to the ring gear 28.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      A connection pattern of the clutches 28 and 29 causes a rearward movement state, the neutral state, and a forward movement state to be determined.
      <br/>
      The driving force is transmitted to a gear ratio (a speed ratio in the case of the CVT) varying mechanism 104 via a rotary axle 33.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      In the first embodiment, the gear ratio varying mechanism 104 is constituted by the continuously variable transmission.
      <br/>
      The drive force transmitted to the primary pulley 34 is transmitted to the secondary pulley 35 via the belt 36 and is transmitted to the drive axle via an idler gear, a final gear, and a differential gear (not shown) so that the drive road wheels of the vehicle are driven.

    <p num="54">
      The control unit C1 is connected to an ignition switch 31.
      <br/>
      The control unit C1 receives each sensor output signal from a vehicular velocity sensor S2, a brake sensor 33, an acceleration sensor S4, an A/T position sensor S5, a voltage meter S6, and engine speed sensor S7, performs various arithmetic/logic operations based on the sensor output signals, and outputs control signals to an electromagnetic clutch 102c, the motor/generator 102b, an electromagnetic valve 43 (refer to FIG. 22), and an engine control unit C2.
      <br/>
      The engine control unit C2 serves to control drive of the engine 23.
      <br/>
      In the first embodiment, the engine control unit C2 outputs control signals to a variable valve timing mechanism A1 (it is noted that the variable valve timing mechanism includes an electromagnetically-powered valve operating apparatus as will be described later), a fuel injection unit A2, and ignition unit A3 on the basis of a command signal (one of the control signals) from the control unit C1.

      The modified oil flow has a torque augmentation action due to a summing of the engine torque and a reaction force of the stator blade 11.

    <p num="133">FIG. 21 shows a structure of the VEL 60.</p>
    <p num="134">
      In FIG. 21, an intake valve 51 (in FIG. 21, an upper end portion thereof is shown) is biased in a close direction by means of a biasing force inputted from a valve lift mechanism 50 through a spring (not shown).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 21, numeral 52 denotes a camshaft.
      <br/>
      When the camshaft 52 is revolved, a cam 49 integrally attached on the camshaft 52 is revolved in the camshaft revolution.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      In addition, when the cam 49 is revolved, a left side end portion of a swing arm 47 as viewed from FIG. 21 is accordingly lifted and lowered so that a right side end of the swing arm 47 repeats a pendulum motion is lifted and lowered in the reversed sequence to the left side end thereof with its control axle 45 as a center.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the upper end portion of the swing arm 48 is accordingly lifted and lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      Hence, as a swing cam 48 is displaced in a downward direction as viewed from FIG. 21, the valve lifter 50 is depressed downward to open the intake valve 51.
      <br/>
      It is noted that numeral 53 denotes a torsional spring to bias the swing arm 48 in a counterclockwise direction.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      The control axle 45 is pivotally supported with a point P2 in FIG. 21 as an axial center.
      <br/>
      This pivotal motion of the control axle 45 is carried out by the VEL actuator (electromagnetic actuator) A1 shown in FIG. 4.

      That is to say, the VEL actuator A1 causes the control axle 45 to be pivoted.

      When a wall thickness portion of the control axle 45 is moved, a press-down length of the swing arm 47 is modified so that a valve closure timing and valve lift variable are modified.
      <br/>
      Thus, an open-and-closure timing and a valve lift quantity are variably controlled to secure an improvement of fuel economy and a stable driveability during the engine low-speed-and-low-load condition and to secure a sufficient output due to an improvement in an intake air charging efficiency during an engine high-speed-and-high-load condition.

      In the first embodiment, a combustion efficiency is improved by the VEL 60 to perform, so-called, an Atkinson cycle.

      Furthermore, in the first embodiment, the VEL actuator A1 is operated to actuate the intake valve 51 not to wholly open (to be completely closed or the intake valve 51 is continued to be in a full close state).
      <br/>
      If the intake valve 51 remains closed, the air in the cylinder of the engine 23 is tightly closed so that a loss in a movement energy involved in air in-flow or air out-flow with the in-cylinder air tightly closed becomes nullified.

      That is to say, in a case where the engine restart processing is carried out, i.e., in a case where the engine 23 is restarted with the engine 23 stopped, the following three situations may occur.
      <br/>
      First one is the vehicular velocity (Vs) which indicates the deceleration state from 3.5 Km/h to 40 km/h, the other is that the A/T position is in the "D" range, and the engine 23 has stopped.
      <br/>
      In this situation, the routine goes to the step 1315 for the deceleration and the re-acceleration processing.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      The second one is the case where the vehicular velocity falls in a range from zero to 3.5 Km/h, the A/T position is in the D range and the engine 23 stops.
      <br/>
      This situation indicates the state where the motor creep process is executed.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      At this time, if the accelerator is operated and SOC&gt;SET, the control unit C1 determines if the moderate acceleration or the abrupt acceleration occurs according to the opening angle of the accelerator.
      <br/>
      If the abrupt acceleration occurs, the routine is transferred to the acceleration processing 700 from the motor creep shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The reason of determining again SOC&gt;SET is that the background job is carried out so that a regular interrupt processing and event-driven interrupt processing are repeated in the background job.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      It is considered that even if the creep process is being executed, the other processing is transferred so as to be returned to the creep process again.
      <br/>
      In other words, it is considered that since each processing can mutually independently be situation confirmed by itself, the other processes than the motor creep are sequentially executed even if the control unit C1 runs in the motor creep mode.
    </p>
    <p num="170">When the moderate acceleration occurs, the control unit C1 outputs the signal to switch the forward-rearward switching mechanism 103 from the D range to the N range and, once, releases the connection between the drive axle 17 and the transmission 104.</p>

    <p num="173">FIG. 16(b) shows the timing chart on the control flow.</p>
    <p num="174">It is noted that the reason of switching as D --&gt; N --&gt; D in the forward-rearward switching mechanism 103 during the engine start is that a torque variation due to the engine start is transmitted to the drive wheel so that the disagreeable feeling is not given to the vehicular driver.</p>

      FIG. 22 shows a structure of the shift valve 42 to perform the switching sequence as D --&gt; N --&gt; D in the forward-rearward switching mechanism portion 103.
      <br/>
      The shift valve 42 is connected to a shift lever (which determines the A/T position described above but not shown in the drawings).
    </p>
    <p num="177">
      On the basis of a manipulation on the shift lever, each position on the lever positions of "P (Parking)", "R (Reverse)", "N (Neutral)", "D (Drive)", "2nd (Second), and "1st (First)" can be switched.
      <br/>
      When the shift valve 42 is placed at the "D" range, a line pressure is supplied to an oil passage shown by D in FIG. 22. When the shift valve 42 is placed at the "R" range, the hydraulic (oil pressure) is supplied to an oil passage denoted by R shown in FIG. 22. Upon receipt of the hydraulic pressure signal the forward-and-rearward movement switching mechanism 103 is constructed to switch the forward-and-rearward movement.
      <br/>
      In addition, at the "N" range, no line pressure is supplied to any oil passage shown in FIG. 22.
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      An electromagnetic valve 43 is disposed in a midway through the oil passage denoted by D. When the electromagnetic valve 43 is not driven, the line pressure is supplied to the oil passage shown by D. When the electromagnetic valve 43 is driven, the oil passage denoted by D is closed so that the signal of "N" range is outputted with respect to the forward-rearward switching mechanism 103.
      <br/>
      If a gear shift range is modified as D --&gt; N --&gt; D according to the process of the steps 1206 and 1212, the switching from D to N drives the electromagnetic valve 43.
      <br/>
      The switching from N to D is carried out by the stop of the drive through the electromagnetic valve 43.
      <br/>
      Since the electromagnetic valve 43 is installed as shown in FIG. 22, a high response characteristic switching of D --&gt; N --&gt; D can be made.

However, as compared with the case at the step 1324 in the deceleration and re-acceleration process described above with reference to FIG. 13, there is a difference point in that the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c is connected (engaged).
      <br/>
      This is because a sufficient hydraulic (pressure) is secured during the vehicular run.
    </p>

      As described above, in the first embodiment according to the present invention the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c in which the hydraulic clutch and the electromagnetic clutch are juxtaposed to each other as the clutch to render the torque converter 102a in the lock-up state and the motor/generator 102b is installed within the outer housing 5.
      <br/>
      Even though the motor/generator 102b is relatively disposed toward the transmission 105 to the torque converter 102a having the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c, the electromagnetic portion is engaged according to its necessity even under the condition such that the hydraulic clutch portion of the clutch 102c is not engaged, so that the engine 23 and the motor/generator 102b can be linked together.
      <br/>
      Hence, the motor/generator 102b can exhibit the function of any of the starter (for the engine 23), the alternator, the drive assistance, and the regeneration device.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is not necessary to modify remarkably the already present and normally available power train and to modify remarkably the production line.
      <br/>
      Thus, the motor/generator unit 102 can achieve a low cost product.
    </p>
    <p num="228">
      Furthermore, since the housing of the torque converter 102a has the same structure as the product already present and normally available, it becomes possible to set two types of the specifications that the presently available torque converter 102a is directly used without adding the motor/generator unit 102 thereinto and that the torque converter 102a into which the motor/generator unit 102 is installed.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a degree of freedom in design can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="229">
      In addition, when the torque converter 102a is made in the lock-up state, both of a bending vibration and a torsional vibration are inputted to a torque converter 102a from both of the engine and the transmission.
      <br/>
      At this time, these vibrations can be absorbed by means of the flexible plate 14 and the torsional spring 15.
      <br/>
      Hence, it becomes difficult to generate the relative displacement in a direction orthogonal to the axis between the rotor 8 and the outer housing 5 linked to the drive axle 17 outputted from the torque converter 102a.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it becomes difficult to interfere against each other between the rotor 8 and the stator 1 in the motor/generator 102b even if an interval of distance between the rotor 8 and the stator 1 is narrowed
    </p>
    <p num="230">An input/output efficiency in the motor/generator 102b can be improved.</p>
    <p num="231">
      In addition, since the rotor supporting member 8a is installed, a length of a radial direction and an axial direction can be secured.
      <br/>
      Hence, if becomes possible to enlarge the drive capacity and the capacity of regeneration.
    </p>
    <p num="232">
      In addition, since the fin 6 is installed on the rotor supporting member 8a, a functional reduction of the motor/generator 102b due to the heat generated on the motor/generator 102b can be prevented from occurring.
      <br/>
      This jacket to cause the cooling medium to flow onto the outer housing 5 is installed on the outer housing 5.
      <br/>
      This causes the stator 1 to be cooled so that the reduction in function of the motor/generator 102b cannot occur.
    </p>
    <p num="233">Since the built-in oil pump 4 is installed, it is not necessary to install the oil pump external to the converter housing and the structure can be compacted.</p>
    <p num="234">
      Even in a case where the engine 23 is directly coupled to the drive axle 17 on which the motor/generator 102b is installed by means of the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c, a resistance at the engine side is dropped by the quantity by which the energy loss of the engine 23 due to the stop of the valves through the VEL 60 is suppressed and the regeneration is carried out by the quantity by which the resistance is dropped.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the regeneration can be carried out without giving the vehicular driver disagreeable feeling for the driving of the vehicle and the regeneration capability can be improved.
      <br/>
      That is to say, since, with the direct coupling between the engine 23 and the motor/generator 102b, the brake force corresponding to the regeneration is developed in addition to the normal engine brake and, therefore, the drive force is increased so that the vehicular driver gives the disagreeable feeling to the vehicular driver.
    </p>
    <p num="235">
      However, in the first embodiment, in the direct coupling state, the energy loss of the engine 23 is suppressed to reduce the brake force from the engine brake and the regeneration is carried out by the quantity corresponding to this reduction.

      The total brake force, thus, corresponds to the engine brake so that no disagreeable feeling is given to the vehicular driver.

      If Yes at the step 2302, the routine goes to a step 2303.
      <br/>
      If No at the step 2302, the present routine is ended.
      <br/>
      At the step 2303, the control unit 11 confirms that the engine has started from the engine speed.
    </p>
    <p num="248">At the step 2304, the control unit C1 is operated to stop the motor/generator 102b functioning as the motor.</p>
    <p num="249">In the second embodiment, the case where the vehicular engine 23 stops with the A/T position in the "D" range means that, in the engine idling state, the brake pedal is depressed and the vehicular velocity Vs is 0 km/h.</p>
    <p num="250">
      When the brake pedal is released from the abovedescribed state, the accelerator is manipulated (in the ON state), and SOC&gt;SET.
      <br/>
      At this time, the control unit C1 determines if the abrupt acceleration or moderate acceleration occurs from the accelerator manipulation variable (depression depth or opening angle).
    </p>
    <p num="251">
      In the case of the occurrence of the moderate acceleration, the control unit C1 confirms that the forward-rearward switching mechanism 103 is switched into the "N" range.
      <br/>
      Then, the motor/generator 102b is operated to function as the starter and the forward-rearward switching mechanism 103 is changed to the "D" range to complete the engine re-start.
      <br/>
      The difference point from those steps described in the first embodiment is that it is not necessary to connect the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c.
      <br/>
      When the motor/generator 102b is revolved as the starter, the pump impeller 10 is simultaneously revolved.
    </p>
    <p num="252">
      Hence, the augmented start torque is transmitted to the turbine runner 12.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a smooth start of the engine can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="253">In the case of the determination that the abrupt acceleration occurs, the motor/generator 102b is caused to function as the starter and is utilized as an initial drive source so that a sufficient torque can be outputted to the drive axle 17 via the torque converter 102a.</p>
    <p num="254">
      If the revolution speed of the engine output axle 13 is equal to or higher than 1400 rpm, the engine start is confirmed from the engine speed and the motor/generator 102b as the starter is stopped.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the smooth response to the driver's demand can be achieved without loss of the highly responsive characteristic demanded during the abrupt acceleration.
    </p>
    <p num="255">FIG. 26 shows a flowchart for the deceleration-and-re-acceleration process when the vehicular running condition is transferred from the deceleration to the acceleration states.</p>
    <p num="256">It is noted that contents of steps which are different from those shown in FIG. 14 in the case of the first embodiment will be described below.</p>
    <p num="257">At a step 2401, the control unit C1 is operated to stop the regeneration through the motor/generator (STR/ALT 105b).</p>
    <p num="258">At a step 2402, the control unit C1 is operated to resume the fuel injection through the engine 23.</p>
    <p num="259">At a step 2403, the control unit C1 is operated to connect the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c.</p>
    <p num="260">At a step 2404, the control unit C1 is operated to perform the normal acceleration in response to the accelerator manipulation.</p>
    <p num="261">At a step 2405, the control unit C1 is operated to stop the regeneration by means of the motor/generator 102b.</p>
    <p num="262">At a step 2406, the control unit C1 is operated to resume the fuel injection through the engine 23.</p>
    <p num="263">At a step 2407, the control unit C1 is operated to connect the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c.</p>
    <p num="264">At a step 2408, the control unit C1 is operated to perform the acceleration in response to the accelerator manipulation through the engine 23.</p>
    <p num="265">
      In the second embodiment, during the deceleration, the fuel supply (fuel injection) is cut off, the valve operating mechanism, viz., the valve operation is stopped through the VEL 60, and the regeneration through the motor/generator 102b is carried out to recover the pump loss.
      <br/>
      This series of operation is the same as described in the first embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="266">However, since, in the second embodiment, the rotor 8 is installed on the converter cover 3 and the engine is always linked to the motor/generator 102b, the regeneration corresponding to the engine friction is not carried out.</p>
    <p num="267">In addition, since the control over the lock-up release is referred to the vehicular velocity Vs, there are two states one of which is the release of the engagement of the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c and the other of which is the continuation of the engagement thereof.</p>
    <p num="268">In the engagement state, the regeneration operation is continued.</p>
    <p num="269">At a time point at which the release operation is carried out, the regeneration is not carried out.</p>
    <p num="270">
      When the vehicular running state is transferred from the deceleration to the acceleration, the control unit C1 determines if the present acceleration is the abrupt or moderate acceleration.
      <br/>
      In the case of the abrupt acceleration, the control unit C1 is operated to stop the regeneration through the motor/generator 102c, to resume the fuel injection for the engine 23, to connect the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c, and to perform the manual acceleration in response to the accelerator manipulation.
    </p>
    <p num="271">In a case where the routine shown in FIG. 26 goes to the step 2407 with the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c connected, the control unit jumps over the step 2407 to the step 2408.</p>
    <p num="272">In addition, the reason of engaging the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c is to cope positively with an abrupt torque variation during the abrupt acceleration.</p>
    <p num="273">On the other hand, if the control unit C1 determines that the moderate acceleration occurs, the regeneration through the motor/generator 102b is stopped, the fuel injection for the engine 23 is resumed, only the hydraulic clutch portion of the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c is connected, and the normal acceleration in response to the accelerator manipulation through the engine 23 is carried out.</p>
    <p num="274">
      It is noted that in a case where the routine shown in FIG. 26 goes to the step 2403 with the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c connected, the routine in FIG. 26 jumps over the step 2403 to the step 2404.
      <br/>
      Since, during the moderate acceleration, the abrupt torque variation does not occur, only the engagement of the hydraulic clutch portion of the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c can cope sufficiently with a moderate torque variation.
    </p>
    <p num="275">As described above, it is possible to make the axial length of the motor/generator unit 102 in the second embodiment exactly the same as the torque converter 102a which is installed in the conventional vehicle so as to be enabled to be an easy installation in the conventional vehicle.</p>
    <p num="276">Since the housing is only the one, the manufacturing cost can be suppressed in terms of the production.</p>
    <p num="277">
      It is noted that, in FIGS. 2 and 23, reference numeral 16c denotes a common facing surface of the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c attached on a peripheral end surface of the lock-up piston 16, reference numeral 16b denotes a coil portion of the electromagnetic clutch portion of the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102b attached on the side surface of the torque converter housing 3, reference numeral 16a denotes an opposing common facing surface of the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c, reference numeral 19 denotes a flexible hollow pipe to introduce an electrical wire connected to the control unit C1 to the coil portion 16b of the electromagnetic/hydraulic clutch 102c, 19a denotes the electrical wire.
      <br/>
      It is noted that the control unit C1 is connected to the motor/generator 102c via the power supply portion 44 in FIGS. 2 and 23 (also refer to FIG. 4).
