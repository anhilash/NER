      A tracking method discriminates whether an optical disc loaded in a recording and/or reproduction system is a shallow groove type optical disc or a deep groove type optical disc, and corrects the phase of the tracking error signal detected from the optical disc according to the discrimination result, to then perform a tracking servo control using the corrected result.
      <br/>
      A tracking apparatus includes an optical signal detector detecting a tracking error signal from an optical disc loaded in a recording and/or reproduction system.
      <br/>
      A groove type discriminator analyzes the tracking error signal output from the optical signal detector to discriminate a groove type of the loaded optical disc and generates a corresponding control signal.
      <br/>
      A phase corrector corrects the phase of the tracking error signal output from the optical signal detector according to the control signal applied from the groove type discriminator.
      <br/>
      A tracking servo portion servo-controls a beam spot to perform an accurate tracking over a center line of a target track of the loaded optical disc, using the phase-corrected tracking error signal.
      <br/>
      The tracking method and apparatus enables accurate tracking-servo-controlling of both the shallow groove type optical disc and the deep groove type optical disc.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a tracking method for use in recording data on and reproducing data from a high-density optical disc having lands and grooves and a tracking apparatus adopting the same, and more particularly, to a method for accurately tracking servo-controlling both a shallow groove type optical disc and a deep groove type optical disc which are loaded in a recording and/or reproducing system and an apparatus adopting the same.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Recently, in the optical disc technical field, optical discs are being developed and vary from a low-density laser disc (LD) and compact disc (CD) to a high-density digital versatile disc (DVD).
      <br/>
      A currently developed DVD enlarges the numerical aperture (NA) of an objective lens in an optical pickup and uses a short wavelength laser, and thus largely enhances a recording density when compared with an existing CD.
      <br/>
      As an example, a digital versatile disc-random access memory (DVD-RAM) having a recording capacity of 2.6 GB was developed using a laser beam having a wavelength of 650 nm.
      <br/>
      Recently, a DVD-RAM of 4.7 GB has been developed by further narrowing a track pitch thereof and further shortening the length of a pit which is used for actually recording information.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Generally, an optical disc having a recordable and reproducible land/groove has a periodic arrangement of lands and grooves of the same pitch.
      <br/>
      Here, a recording and/or reproduction system records data on and reproduces the data from each land and groove of a loaded optical disc.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows the structure of lands and grooves on a known shallow groove type optical disc.
      <br/>
      The shallow groove type optical disc is defined as an optical disc on the substrate of which grooves of  LAMBDA /8+L n through  LAMBDA /4+L n in depth are formed, in which  LAMBDA  is a laser wavelength of an optical pickup and n is a refractive index of the substrate of the optical disc.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, the optical disc has a track pitch 3 of 0.74  MU m defined as a width ranging from the center of a land 1 to that of a groove 2 and a groove depth 4 of  LAMBDA /6.5+L n where laser incident light 5 having a wavelength ( LAMBDA ) of 650 nm is used for the optical disc.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Meanwhile, FIG. 2 shows the structure of lands and grooves on a known deep groove type optical disc for enhancing a recording density in comparison with the shallow groove type optical disc shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The deep groove type optical disc is defined as an optical disc on the substrate of which grooves of  LAMBDA /4+L n through  LAMBDA /2+L n in depth are formed, in which  LAMBDA  is a laser wavelength of an optical pickup and n is a refractive index of the substrate of the optical disc.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the optical disc has a shorter track pitch 13 of 0.58  MU m (the width from the center of a land 11 to that of a groove 12) and a shorter pit than those of FIG. 1 in which laser incident light 5 of 630 nm, shorter than that of FIG. 1, is used for the optical disc.
      <br/>
      In this case, cross-talk increases due to interference from signals recorded on neighboring tracks during reproduction of data, and more influences are given to neighboring tracks during recording and erasing data.
      <br/>
      To solve these problems, the optical disc of FIG. 2 has a groove depth 14 of  LAMBDA /3+L n deeper than that of FIG. 1 to thereby minimize the effects due to the signal interference from the neighboring tracks.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Meanwhile, a tracking error signal (TES) should be obtained from an optical disc, in order to servo-control an optical pickup so that the beam spot from the optical pickup performs an exact tracking over the center line of a target track on the optical disc, during recording and reproducing data.
      <br/>
      In a push-pull method chiefly adopted for this purpose, two-division-photodiodes (2D-PD) or four-division-photodiodes (4D-PD) which are arranged symmetrically left and right with respect to the center line of a track detect the strength of the light reflected and diffracted from the optical disc, and a left-right light strength difference of signals detected with respect to the center line of the track is obtained as a tracking error signal.
      <br/>
      The tracking error signal of the push-pull method is called a push pull signal (PPS).
      <br/>
      A tracking servo portion complementarily drives an actuator for driving an objective lens or a rough-movement motor for driving the entire optical pickup portion, using the obtained tracking error signal, to thereby servo-control the optical pickup so that the beam spot of the optical pickup performs an accurate tracking over the center line of the target track.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      However, the tracking error signal detected from the above-described deep groove type optical disc is reversed in phase (polarity) in comparison with that detected from the shallow groove type optical disc.
      <br/>
      As a result, when a recording and/or reproduction system for the shallow groove type optical disc performs a tracking servo control over the deep groove type optical disc, an error occurs in the tracking error signal.
      <br/>
      Thus, an accurate tracking servo control cannot be performed.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">
      Reference will now made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
      <br/>
      The embodiments are described below in order to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing a tracking apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      An optical signal detector 30 detects a tracking error signal from an optical disc loaded in a recording and/or reproduction system, on the basis of a push-pull method.
      <br/>
      A groove type discriminator 32 analyzes the tracking error signal output from the optical signal detector 30, discriminates whether the currently loaded disc is a shallow groove type or a deep groove type, and generates a control signal C1 or C2 in correspondence to the discrimination result.
      <br/>
      A phase correction portion 34 either does not invert the phase of the tracking error signal output from the optical signal detector 30 or inverts the same, according to the control signal from the groove type discriminator 32.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the phase correction portion 34 corrects the phase of the detected tracking error signal and outputs the corrected result to a tracking servo portion 36.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the phase correction portion 34 includes a phase inverter 34a and a switching portion 34b.
      <br/>
      The phase inverter 34a inverts the phase of the tracking error signal output from the optical signal detector 30 and outputs the inverted result to the switching portion 34b.
      <br/>
      The switching portion 34b selects the tracking error signal output from the optical signal detector 30 if the control signal C1 of a shallow groove type optical disc is applied from the groove type discriminator 32, and selects the tracking error signal which has been phase-inverted in the phase inverter 34a if the control signal C2 of a deep groove type optical disc is applied therefrom, and then outputs the selected one to the tracking servo portion 36.
      <br/>
      The tracking servo portion 36 servo-controls a beam spot to perform an accurate tracking over a center line of a target track of the loaded optical disc, using the tracking error signal which has been phase-corrected in the phase correction portion 34.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The operation of the tracking apparatus shown in FIG. 3 will be described below with reference to the flowchart diagram shown in FIG. 4.</p>
    <p num="21">
      If an optical disc is loaded into a recording and/or reproduction system (not shown) including a tracking apparatus shown in FIG. 3 (step 410), an optical pickup (not shown) in the system moves to the initial position of the loaded optical disc, and then a focusing is performed so that a beam spot is accurately formed on the recording surface of the optical disc (step 420).
      <br/>
      If the focusing is completed, the system moves the beam spot of the optical pickup to a header region on which a sync signal and sector address information and so on are recorded.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Then, the tracking apparatus of FIG. 3 according to the first embodiment of the present invention discriminates whether the optical disc having lands and grooves for recording and reproduction and which is currently loaded into the system is a shallow groove type optical disc or a deep groove type optical disc (step 431).
      <br/>
      In more detail, if a beam spot formed by the laser light emission of the optical pickup is diffracted and reflected from the header region on the optical disc, the optical signal detector 30 of FIG. 3 detects a tracking error signal.
      <br/>
      The groove type discriminator 32 analyzes the tracking error signal output from the optical signal detector 30 and discriminates the groove type of the loaded optical disc.
      <br/>
      As a result of the discrimination, the groove type discriminator 32 generates the first control signal C1 if the loaded optical disc is a shallow groove type, and the second control signal C2 if the loaded optical disc is a deep groove type.
      <br/>
      Here, the groove type discriminator 32 determines that the loaded optical disc is a shallow groove type optical disc if the phase of the tracking error signal detected from the currently loaded optical disc has not been inverted, and determines that the loaded optical disc is a deep groove type optical disc if inverted, in comparison with the phase of a predetermined reference signal corresponding to the tracking error signal of the shallow groove type optical disc.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is preferable that the tracking error signal for discriminating the groove type of the optical disc is detected from the header region of the optical disc, but the present invention is not limited thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Meanwhile, the switching portion 34b of FIG. 3 selects the tracking error signal having a non-inverted phase output from the optical signal detector 30 and outputs the selected result to the tracking servo portion 36, if the first control signal C1 is applied from the groove type discriminator 32, and selects the tracking error signal having an inverted phase output from the phase inverter 34a and outputs the selected result to the tracking servo portion 36 if the second control signal C2 is applied from the groove type discriminator 32 (step 432).
      <br/>
      The tracking servo portion 36 servo-controls a beam spot to perform an accurate tracking over the center line of a target track of the loaded optical disc, using the tracking error signal supplied from the switching portion 34b (step 433).
      <br/>
      The above-described steps 431 through 433 correspond to the tracking method of the optical disc according to the embodiment of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      If the beam spot generated from the optical pickup performs an accurate tracking over the center line of the target track, a recording and/or reproduction system moves the optical pickup in order to read out identification data (ID) representing the start of each sector (step 440).
      <br/>
      Then, the above-described system moves the optical pickup to a target sector of a data region on the basis of the read ID in order to record data thereon or reproduce the same therefrom (step 450).
    </p>
    <p num="25">Meanwhile, an alternative method for discriminating the groove type of an optical disc loaded into a recording and/or reproduction system according to a second embodiment of the present invention, records groove type identification information indicating a shallow groove type or a deep groove type in advance into a header region on an optical disc, and discriminates whether the loaded optical disc is a shallow groove type optical disc or a deep groove type optical disc based on the read groove type identification information.</p>
    <p num="26">
      Another tracking apparatus (not shown) according to the second embodiment of the present invention can be embodied by substituting the optical signal detector 30 and the groove type discriminator 32 among the respective components shown in FIG. 3 with a modified optical signal detector and a modified groove type discriminator for implementing the above-described alternative groove type discrimination method.
      <br/>
      Briefly, the modified optical signal detector detects a tracking error signal from a loaded optical disc and at the same time reproduces a radio frequency (RF) signal therefrom.
      <br/>
      For example, when four-division photodiodes are employed in the optical signal detector, the RF signal is obtained by adding all the detected signals from each divided photodiode, and corresponds to actual data recorded on the optical disc.
      <br/>
      The RF signal is supplied to the modified groove type discriminator via a predetermined signal processing unit.
      <br/>
      The modified groove type discriminator which can employ an unshown system controller or a servo controller discriminates the groove type identification information previously recorded among the RF playback signals read from the header region on the optical disc, to thereby determine the groove type of the optical disc.
      <br/>
      Also, the groove type discriminator applies the control signal C1 or C2 in correspondence to the discrimination result to the phase inverter 34 shown in the apparatus of FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Since the structures and functions of the phase inverter 34 and the tracking servo portion 36 are same as those of the apparatus of FIG. 3, the detailed description thereof will be omitted.
      <br/>
      Further, since it is apparent to a person who has ordinary skill in the art that the above-described modified structures and functions can originate from the apparatus of FIG. 3 with the technical concept of the present invention and the above description, the drawings thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="27">As described above, the tracking method and apparatus of the optical disc according to the present invention discriminates the groove type of the optical disc loaded in the recording and/or reproduction system, and uses a tracking error signal which is phase-corrected based on the discrimination result, to thereby provide an effect capable of accurately tracking-servo-controlling both a shallow groove type optical disc and a deep groove type optical disc.</p>
    <p num="28">While certain embodiments of the invention have been specifically described herein, it will be apparent that numerous modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
