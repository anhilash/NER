      <br/>
      However, the above-mentioned technical scheme is mainly pointing to the theoretical research of 8-form circulation and in need of further improvement with respect to heat exchange and thermodynamic cycle efficiency of J-pipe.
      <br/>
      There still exist quite a few problems in its cooling-weight ratio, volumetric ratio, industrialization of manufacturing process and reducing product cost, hence it is difficult to achieve a fundamental result in solving the three major difficult problems (high energy consumption , low air quality, limited use of CFCs (chloroflucrocarbons).

    <p num="5">
      The present invention, first of all, is striving for the raise of heat exchange efficiency and thermodynamic cycle efficiency and full utilization of air energy.
      <br/>
      The high efficiency J pipe means that heat exchanger of rather small volume can achieve large heat exchange capacity and rather low heat transmission temperature difference.
      <br/>
      Due to high efficiency characteristics of J pipe, the key technical indices of the present invention on cooling-weight ratio, volumetric ratio (volume occupied by unit refrigerating capacity air conditioning), manufacturing cost, etc. are superior to current air conditioners by merging the full utilization of air energy and non-isothermal, low temperature difference heat transfer characteristics of high efficiency J pipe organically into one integral can run at a COP (refrigerating capacity/net output power of low pressure pump) value above 25 during +character pullout}-form circulation, and rn at a COP value above 30 during all fresh air 8-from circulation.

    <heading>THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT MODE OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of circulation principle of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="8">
      J1 is J1 pipe, J2 is J2 pipe, M is low pressure pump, m is capillary tube.
      <br/>
      The low pressure pump is connected between the incoming vapor tube of J2 pipe and suction vapor tube of J1 pipe, the heat pump type is connected in between a four-way conversion valve; the capillary tube m is connected between the liquid supplying tube of J2 pipe and an incoming liquid tube of J1 pipe.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Due to a rather high heat exchange efficiency of J pipe, the J1 pipe and J2 pipe by adopting (2-5) temperature zones of separation will realize 0.1.about 0 (slashed zero) 5 (degree)  C. heat transfer temperature difference.</p>
    <p num="10">The working pressure of J1 pipe is P1, the working pressure of J2 pipe is P2.</p>
    <p num="11">Outdoor air a3 through J1 pipe being cooled from tn-t1 to a2 state is conveyed indoor, a2.apprxeq.t1, a3.apprxeq.tn.</p>
    <p num="12">Indoor air a1 through J2 pipe from t1'.about.tn' absorbing heat, after absorbing moisture at a4 state is discharged outdoor, t1' approaches wet bulb temperature of a1.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The liquid state dilute solution x2 composed of absorbent and corresponding refrigerant through J2 pipe after being cooled to t1' temperature through capillary tube m being decompressed to P1, in J1 pipe is heated by air gradually from t1.about.tn to a temperature approaching a3 dry bulb temperature of a mixture x3 of superheated refrigerant vapor and absorbent concentrated solution, x3 through the low pressure pump M is pressurized to x1 state of P2 to enter J2 and from tn'.about.t1' is gradually cooled to dilute solution of x2.
      <br/>
      The concentrated absorbent solution being cooled to tn'.about.t1' with its surface differential pressure being rather low has a strong ability to absorb vapor state refrigerant, hence the equilibrium condensing pressure P2 of J2 pipe is rather low.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The window machine and outdoor machine of split-body machine of high efficiency J pipe air conditioners are provided with a bottom tray, in the bottom tray is stored water solution or other cool-carrying agent solution at a certain level.
      <br/>
      The condensed water of J1 through dripping tube flows to the bottom tray and is sprayed to moisten ventilation ducts F of J2 by water circulating system through timing and metering, F ducts have water carrying and water absorbing capacity and can form a large superficial evaporating water film when it is in wetting state and its inner hydrous layer has very good thermal conductivity.
      <br/>
      So J2 radiates heat in continuously completed wet state.
      <br/>
      Hence t1' can indefinitely approach wet bulb temperature of a1, and as the t1'.about.tn' temperature rise being is rather small, the above-mentioned circulation is an 8-form circulation.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      When the cooled air passing through J1 pipe is indoor air a1 and the cooling air passing through J2 is outdoor air a3, x3 can only be heated to dry bulb temperature of a1 (a1&lt;a3), the lowest temperature t1' of J2-pipe can also only be cooled to wet bulb temperature of a3, and the wet bulb temperature of a3 is higher than wet bulb temperature of a1.
      <br/>
      Due to changes of air state via J1 pipe and J2 pipe, the 8-form circulation will evolve to +character pullout}-form circulation.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As compared with current air conditioners, the J1 pipe in 8-form and +character pullout}-form circulation corresponds to evaporator, and generator, J2 pipe corresponds to condenser and absorber.
      <br/>
      The distinction lies in that the evaporating pressure P1 of J1 is higher than the current air conditioners, while the condensing temperature and pressure P2 are far lower than the current air conditioners; hence the low pressure pump M as compared with compressors of equal flow volume requires a net power less than 1/3, while with a refrigerating capacity being able to increase over 1 time.

    <p num="17">Referring to accompanying FIGS. 2,3,4,5,6, FIG. 2 is a front view of J2 pipe, FIG. 3 is a top view of J2 pipe, FIG. 4 is an enlarged left sectional view of J2 pipe, FIG. 5 is sectional view of slender round tubes of J2 strips, FIG. 6 is a partial enlarged view of designation 5 in FIG. 2.</p>

    <p num="19">
      The heat exchange system of J2 pipe is formed by stacking alternately multiple-layer J2 strips 1 and multiple-layer membrane corrugations 2 and being tightly clamed up into frames composed of rib-shaped clamping plates 3 and tie rods 4.
      <br/>
      Ducts F of cooling air a1.about.a4 is constituted from membrane corrugation 2 and J2 strips 1, both ends of each membrane corrugation 2 have each a slender rectangled strip-shaped pad 7, at the contact places of clamping plates 3 and membrane corrugations 2 there are adhered buffer cushions 18; each J2 strip 1 constitutes in its flat tube (14) a complete from tn'.about.t1' non-isothermal working substance passage, at the inlet of working substance there is the incoming vapor branch tube 8 connected in parallel to the parallel connecting tube 9 (or distributor) of the incoming vapor tube 10, at the outlet of working substance there is the outgoing liquid branch tube 11 connected in parallel to the parallel connecting tube 12 (or distributor) of the liquid supplying tube.
    </p>
    <p num="20">See FIGS. 3,4. Two flat tubes 14 arranged in parallel spacing in J2 strips 1 are inserted with inner corrugated plates 15 made of thin aluminum sheet for enlarging heat dissipating area of working substance fluid, at the turns of flow of working substance are provided curved conduits 16, at the outlet and inlet of working substance are connected respectively the outgoing liquid branch tube 11 and incoming vapor branch tube 8, outside flat tubes is wrapped membrane type evaporating surfaces 16, between flat tubes 14 and membrane evaporating surfaces 16 are inserted 2 water-carrying yarns 20, the water-carrying yarn 20 is divided into 2 temperature zone by a heat insulating strip 19 made of heat insulating material, hence each flat tube 14 constitutes an isothermal heat exchange zone, the flat tube can be made of thin metallic tube about  PHI 6 mm pressed into narrow and thin flat tube.</p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 5 is sectional view of slender round tubes of J2 strips.
      <br/>
      The working substance flow passages are slender round tubes 14' into which are inserted inner corrugated plates 15, each slender round tube 14' constitutes an isothermal heat exchange zone with heat insulating strip 19 as boundary, the advantages of J2 strips composed of slender round tubes 14' lies in more divided temperature zones available and reduce the pressure of membrane corrugations 2 and clamping plates 3.
      <br/>
      Flat tubes 14 and slender round tubes 14' can be made of choice corrosion resistant metal of high heat conductivity, in case of using copper or aluminum material, surface corrosion-resisting treatment ought to be conducted to raise durability.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      See FIGS. 5,6, the membrane corrugations (2) with corrugated fins are made of thin metallic sheet or ribbon of metallic wire mesh with non-woven fabric adhered to both surfaces, after being formed the tow surfaces of the middle step corrugation 21 are adhered with step membranes 22 to compose the membrane corrugation 2, on the vertical wall face of membrane corrugations 2 at the upper side of heat insulating strip 19 are cut out long and strip-shaped heat insulating ports 17 for dividing into heat exchange temperature zones and cooling air can herein form turbulence to strengthen heat exchange.
      <br/>
      The step corrugations 21 as supporting frames can be made of extra thin corrosion resistant metallic (stainless steel or stainless iron) sheet or fine metallic wire mesh.
      <br/>
      The membrane type evaporating surfaces 16, step membrane 22, water-carrying yarns 20 are made of corrosion resistant non-woven fabric (adhesive-bonded fabric) of very strong water-carrying and water absorbing ability, during moistened state, the membrane type evaporating surfaces 16, step membranes 22, water-carrying yarns 20 are saturated with water, the step-shaped ducts F constituted from step membranes 22 and membrane evaporating surfaces 16 have large water evaporating surface area, the water containing layers also have excellent heat conducting property; the water content stored in water-carrying yarns 20 can make F surfaces under a continuously moistened state to extend the interval of water spraying time as long as possible, and on the other hand to strengthen the heat conductivity between J2 strips 1 and membrane corrugations 2.
      <br/>
      Since ducts F are working under a continuously all-wetted state, hence x2 can be cooled to wet bulb temperature of a1.
      <br/>
      The step-shaped ducts F can be designed in their lateral or longitudinal flow directions to an S shape to further enhance heat exchange performance.
