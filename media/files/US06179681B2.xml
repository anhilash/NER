      No. 29/083,662 filed Feb. 13, 1998.
    </p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to a construction kit, and more specifically, to a construction kit which employs universal connectors which are connectable by a tongue-in-slot mechanism and which are available in a range of shapes and sizes for building models.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Construction kits and connectors are well known.
      <br/>
      Such items have employed connectors and additional members having a wide range of shapes and sizes including blocks, pyramids, rods, gears, flat panels, discs and the like.
      <br/>
      Construction kits have been used to build a respective wide range of very crude to semi-realistic models of structures such as airplanes, trains, cars, rockets, buildings, animals and more.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Known construction kits for constructing semi-realistic models generally require either one or both a large number of like-shaped connectors or a wide range of uniquely-shaped connectors generally being connectable in only one or a limited number of ways.
      <br/>
      Such construction kits quickly lose a user's interest due to either the extreme effort required to build a suitable model or the limited number of structures/models that can be made.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Known connectors employ a variety of interconnecting and interlocking means such as holes, bosses, notches, grooves, threads, and joints.
      <br/>
      Those connectors have also been made from a large variety of materials such as wood, plastic, foam and metal.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One widely available connector is the TAZO (tm)  connector sold by Lulirama International, Inc.
      <br/>
      Such connectors are available in a variety of geometric shapes such as a circle, square, pentagon, hexagon and the like.
      <br/>
      Each TAZO (tm)  has four to eight notches on the outer periphery of the disc.
      <br/>
      The width of the notches approximates the thickness of a TAZO (tm)  connector.
      <br/>
      TAZO (tm)  connectors are formed into chains or strips and other structures by detachably and perpendicularly interconnecting their notches so that adjacent TAZO (tm)  connectors are substantially perpendicular to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      By interconnecting a varying number of TAZO (tm)  connectors, some very simple geometric structures, such as a circle, sphere, rod, square, cube triangle, rectangle, block, pyramid and the like, can be formed.
      <br/>
      However, forming semi-realistic models of complicated structures such as airplanes, buildings, animals, automobiles, ships and spaceships, is almost impossible when employing solely TAZO (tm)  connectors and if accomplished generally results in extremely large models.
    </p>
    <p num="8">There remains a need for a construction kit which can form a wide range of semi-realistic models while requiring a limited number of connectors and providing a greater number of ways in which the connectors can be connected.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention overcomes some of the disadvantages of known construction kits and thus is generally directed to a versatile construction kit which is used to easily form a wide variety of semi-realistic models while requiring only a limited number of tongue-in-slot connectors.
      <br/>
      The construction kit is expanded by the addition of further connectors to permit construction of an even greater variety of semi-realistic models of virtually anything such as, by way of example, buildings, people, animals, toys, weapons, machinery, caricatures, fanciful figures, spaceships, and air, land or water borne vehicles, and other such structures.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In one aspect, the invention provides a construction kit having a variety of similarly or uniquely-shaped parts for building semi-realistic models.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention is a construction kit comprising a plurality of substantially planar connectors wherein each connector comprises:
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      a substantially planar body having a defined thickness and being defined by a first outer periphery;
      <br/>
      at least one tongue member having a defined thickness and width and being defined by a second outer periphery;
      <br/>
      a neck member having a defined thickness and width and having a first end attached to said first outer periphery of said body and a second end attached to said second outer periphery of said at least one tongue member; and
      <br/>
      at least one edge defining a respective slot in at least one of said body and said tongue member, said slot having a defined length and width;
      <br/>
      wherein:
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      - each of said at least one tongue member is attached to one of said neck member;
      <br/>
      - the length of said slot is smaller than the width of said tongue member;
      <br/>
      - the width of said slot is larger than the thickness of said tongue member and said neck member;
      <br/>
      - a portion of said second outer periphery of said at least one tongue member which is most proximal said body is spaced from said first outer periphery of said body by a distance which at least approximates the thickness of said tongue member;
      <br/>
      - the width of said neck member is smaller than the length of said slot; and
      <br/>
      - said tongue member is dimensioned to be inserted through said slot.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      At least one of the first and second outer peripheries can include at least one notch which width generally approximates or is smaller than the thickness of the body and the tongue member.
      <br/>
      Placement of one or more notches along the periphery of the connectors can vary to permit building a greater number of semi-realistic models.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A connector according to the invention comprises one or more or a plurality of tongue members and respective attached neck members as well as a plurality of slots.
      <br/>
      The slots can be spaced apart, connected, interconnecting or disposed as desired within the body or the tongue members of the connector.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The tongue-in-slot connectors of the invention are shaped as desired.
      <br/>
      For example, they can have a regular, irregular, geometric, asymmetric, symmetric or other shape.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The universal connectors are provided individually or in groups as individual pieces or as comprising punch-out cards.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The tongue-in-slot connectors of the invention are made of rigid, semi-rigid of flexible materials.
      <br/>
      When the connectors of the invention are properly connected and are made of the appropriate materials they will form virtually any 2- or 3-dimensional shapes and combinations thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="18">When connected by way of their notches, the tongue-in-slot connectors of the invention will interconnect substantially perpendicularly and detachably.</p>
    <p num="19">As the present construction kit forms semi-realistic models, the surfaces of the connectors can be adorned with any of wide range of odoriferous, optic, visual, sensual, graphic, textural, ornamental, image and/or text features.</p>
    <p num="20">Other features, advantages and embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art by the following description, accompanying examples and appended claims.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="22">
      The invention is a construction kit comprising at least two connectors which can be connected by employing a tongue-in-slot mechanism and optionally an interconnecting notch-to-notch mechanism.
      <br/>
      The tongue of the connector is dimensioned to be inserted through the slot of the connector.
      <br/>
      Since the length of the slot is smaller than the width of the tongue, the connection formed by the tongue-in-slot design is substantially stronger and less susceptible to accidental disconnection than is the connection formed by the notch-to-notch design.
      <br/>
      When connected, the connectors of the invention can form fanciful to semi-realistic models of a variety of structures.
    </p>
    <p num="23">By "semi-realistic" is meant appearing to at least some degree as it would in real life or as depicted by a space-filled three-dimensional model.</p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 1A depicts one particular embodiment of the tongue-in-slot connector (1) employed in the present invention wherein connector (1) has four tongue members (3) each attached to the body (2) by way of respective neck members (4) which neck members each have respective first (11) and second (12) edges.
      <br/>
      Each of the tongue members (3) has an edge defining a slot (5), and each tongue member (3) is defined by an outer periphery (7).
      <br/>
      In this particular embodiment, the outer periphery (7) of each tongue member includes at least one notch (6b).
      <br/>
      The body (2) is defined by an outer periphery (9) which includes plural notches (6a) evenly distributed radially along the outer periphery (9) of the body (2).
      <br/>
      The width of notches (6a, 6b) generally approximates the thickness of connector (1), the tongue member (3), the body (2) or the neck (4).
      <br/>
      The notches are optional, and if a plurality is present, they can be radially spaced as desired along the outer peripheries (7) and (9) of the connector (1).
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      By "tongue member" is meant a male member which is dimensioned to be inserted ire the slot or slit of the connector.
      <br/>
      The tongue member is shaped as desired, and while its length can approximate its width, its length is preferably longer than its width.
      <br/>
      The shape of the tongue member can include any shape such as, by way of example and without limitation, a square, rectangle, circle, oval, ellipse, trapezoid, parallelogram, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, any polygon, any geometric shape, irregular shape, regular shape, symmetric shape, asymmetric shape and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      The tongue member can also be shaped as any known, imaginary or fanciful figure, person, place, or thing or its silhouette.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      When more than one tongue member is present in a connector, the shape of the connectors can be selected independently and need not be the same.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the tongue members on a single connector are shaped the same.
      <br/>
      In another preferred embodiment, the tongue members on all the connectors in a construction kit are shaped the same.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The length of the slot (5) is generally shorter than the width of the tongue member (3) and longer than the width of the neck member (4).
      <br/>
      The width of the slot (5) can be slightly smaller but preferably approximates or is larger than the thickness of the tongue member (3) and the neck member (4).
      <br/>
      The tongue member (3) is dimensioned to be inserted through the slot (5).
      <br/>
      A portion (8)of the outer periphery (7) of the tongue member (3) which is most proximal the body (2) is spaced from the outer periphery (9) of the body by a distance (10) which can be slightly smaller but preferably approximates or is greater than the thickness (T1 in FIG. 1E) of the tongue member (3).
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIGS. 2A and 3A depict other exemplary embodiments contemplated for the tongue-in-slot connector of the invention.
      <br/>
      The connector is any generally flat article and in some embodiments is foldable.
      <br/>
      By "connector" is meant a substantially planar connector having a thickness substantially narrower than the longest length of the connector.
      <br/>
      Although the body (2) of the connector (1) is depicted with a square shape, the body (2) can be circular, approximately circular, elliptical, rectangular (FIGS. 3A-3D), triangular (FIGS. 2A-2D) or other regular, irregular, geometric asymmetric or symmetric shape.
      <br/>
      For example, FIG. 8 depicts an universal connector shaped as a leg and FIGS. 11a and 11b depict an universal connector shaped as a race car.
      <br/>
      The connector (1) generally has a thickness that is at least five fold smaller, preferably seven fold smaller, more preferably 10 fold smaller than its length.
      <br/>
      By "approximately circular" is meant a multi-sided geometric shape, or polygon, having five or more sides so that the shape will roughly or closely approximate that of a circle.
      <br/>
      An approximately circular connector can be shaped as a pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon or any multi-sided polygon having nine or more sides.
      <br/>
      The connector is shaped as desired for a particular application.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The connector (1) is generally intended to be substantially planar as exemplified by flat, concave, convex, corrugated and the like configurations.
      <br/>
      The connector (1) can also have any one or more of depressions, ridges, ribs, bosses, projections, indentation, dimples, odoriferous agents, light reflective materials, light absorptive materials, water absorptive materials, water repellent and the like on its surface.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, such as that depicted in FIGS. 11a and 11b, the connector is foldable into a three dimensional structure.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The interconnecting mechanism employed by the various connectors of the invention involves a tongue-in-slot design or mechanism wherein the tongue member of a first connector is dimensioned to be inserted through the slot of a second connector.
      <br/>
      According to the materials used to make the connector, the connected connectors may form a substantially perpendicular to substantially planar or coplanar connection by way of the tongue-in-slot mechanism.
      <br/>
      If the connectors are interconnected by way of notches, the connected connectors will form a substantially perpendicular detachable interconnection.
      <br/>
      By "substantially perpendicular" is meant that the planes which define respective connectors will be substantially normal to each other when the respective connectors are interconnected.
      <br/>
      By "interconnecting" is meant employs two snugly fitting parts to form a connection.
      <br/>
      For example, notches (6a) and (6b) are approximately the same width as the thickness of the connector (1).
      <br/>
      When a first connector (1) is interconnected with a second connector (1) by way of any of the notches (6a) and (6b), they form a snug fitting perpendicular and detachable interconnection.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The tongue-in-slot design or mechanism of the connectors employed herein are intended to be interlocking.
      <br/>
      By "interlocking" is meant employs a male tongue member and a female slot, aperture, hole or slit, to form a connection which is not easily susceptible to disconnection and which involves insertion of the tongue member through the slot.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The connectors of the invention can be rigid, semi-rigid or flexible and can comprise materials such as, by way of example and without limitation, wood, plastic, rubber, cardboard, paperboard, paper, film, metal, laminates, foils, glass, leather, vinyl, combinations thereof and the like.
      <br/>
      Essentially any material that is not extremely brittle can be used in the connectors of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The terms "slot" or "slit" are taken to mean any aperture disposed in the connector of the invention and which is dimensioned to received a tongue member as herein described.
      <br/>
      Although the slot (5) can generally be of any desired shape, it must be so shaped as to permit complete insertion of the tongue member (3) and at least momentary retention of the tongue member (3) therein.
      <br/>
      The length of the slot (5) can be larger but preferably approximates and more preferably is smaller than the width of the tongue member (3).
      <br/>
      The length of the slot (5) can approximate but is preferably larger than the width of the slot (5).
      <br/>
      Within the above limits, the shape of the slot (5) can be selected as desired.
      <br/>
      For example, the slot can have a regular, irregular, geometric, symmetric, asymmetric shape or combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Particular non-limiting and exemplary embodiments for the shape of the slot are depicted in FIGS. 4A-4N and can include a square (FIG. 4A), rectangle (FIG. 4B), combined rectangle and oval (FIG. 4C), triangle (FIG. 4D), oval (FIG. 4E), combined rectangles and circle (FIG. 4F), plural ovals (FIG. 4G), starburst (FIG. 4H), circle (FIG. 4I), cross (FIG. 4J), hexagon (FIG. 4K), multi-pointed star (FIG. 4L), intersecting geometric shapes such as intersecting triangles (FIG. 4M), arrow (FIG. 4N), multi-sided polygon, ellipse, trapezoid, parallelogram, pentagon, silhouette of any known, imaginary or fanciful person, place or thing and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that plural slots can be disposed anywhere on a connector of the invention.
      <br/>
      They can be separate, connecting, or interconnecting.
    </p>

      The notch (6a) or (6b) of a first connector (1) need only be sufficiently wide to permit detachable and perpendicular interconnection with the notch of a second connector (1).
      <br/>
      It should also be noted that the notches can have different lengths.
      <br/>
      For example, the notches (6a) and (6b) of the connector (1) are generally as long as they are wide, i.e. its length approximates its width.
      <br/>
      However, the notches (6a) and (6b) can be longer than they are wide.
      <br/>
      As well, it is contemplated that the angle of incidence of the notches (6a) and (6b) relative to the outer peripheries (7) and (9), respectively, of the connector (1) can be varied.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Since the connectors of the invention preferably have a plurality of radially spaced tongue members and optionally notches on their outer peripheries, models employing them can advantageously be constructed in a variety of different forms thereby enhancing their semi-realistic appearance.</p>
    <p num="36">
