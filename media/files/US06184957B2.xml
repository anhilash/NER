      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display which is improved in viewing angle characteristics.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      As a display for electronic office system-devices such as a desk-top personal computer and a word processor, CRTs (cathode ray tube) have been employed so far.
      <br/>
      Recently, a liquid crystal displays (hereinafter referred to as LCD) are widely employed instead of the CRTs because of their small thickness, light weight and low power consumption.
      <br/>
      The LCD, however, does not have good display characteristics (especially enlarged viewing angle) equal to those of CRT.
      <br/>
      The LCD generally has a structure that a liquid crystal cell is disposed between a pair of polarizing sheets.
      <br/>
      Most of LCDs use a twisted nematic liquid crystal.
      <br/>
      The operational modes of LCD using the twisted nematic liquid crystal are roughly divided into a birefringence mode and an optical rotatory mode.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A super twisted nematic liquid crystal display (hereinafter referred to as STN-LCD) utilizing the birefringence mode uses a super twisted nematic liquid crystal showing a twisted angle of more than 90 degrees and having steep electro-optical characteristics.
      <br/>
      Such a STN-LCD, therefore, has an advantage of giving the display of a large volume by driving in time-sharing mode.
      <br/>
      However, the STN-LCD has disadvantages such as slow response (such as several hundred milliseconds) and difficulty in giving satisfactory gradation on display, and therefore its display characteristics are relatively poor, as compared with display characteristics of the following liquid crystal display utilizing an optically rotary mode and further provided with the known active-type elements (e.g., TFT-LCD and MIM-LCD).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the TFT-LCD and MIM-LCD, twisted nematic liquid crystal showing a twisted angle of 90 degrees and having positive birefringence is employed for displaying an image.
      <br/>
      This is called LCD of an optically rotary mode (i.e., TN-LCD).
      <br/>
      The TN-LCD display mode shows rapid response (such as several tens of milliseconds) and high display contrast, and easily gives black-white display of high contrast.
      <br/>
      Hence, the optical rotatory mode has a number of advantages compared with the birefringence mode or other modes.
      <br/>
      However, the TN-LCD has disadvantages such as color or contrast on display varies depending upon viewing angle to a liquid crystal display, and its display characteristics are not comparable to display characteristics of a CRT.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In order to improve the viewing angle characteristics (i.e. to enlarge the viewable angle), arrangement of a phase difference film (optical compensatory sheet) between a pair of polarizing plates and TN liquid crystal cell was proposed, and various optical compensatory sheets have been proposed up to now.
      <br/>
      Arrangement of the optical compensatory sheet enlarges the viewing angle to some extent however the enlargement is not sufficiently satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Recently, a liquid crystal cell showing an inherently enlarged viewing angle has been proposed (e.g., Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 7(1995)-84254 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,410,422).
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal cell has a liquid crystal layer comprising liquid crystal capable of forming bend orientation therein and is a self-compensatory cell in which the molecular major axis of liquid crystal is symmetrical with respect to a center line between the substrates of the liquid crystal cell.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal cell shows inherently an enlarged viewing angle.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Further, an abstract (29a-SZC-20, Collected abstracts of Applied Physical Society, 42nd, Spring, 1995) has proposed a reflective type liquid crystal display employing HAN mode (Hybrid-aligned-nematic mode) cell which utilizes the upper side of the liquid crystal layer of the bend orientation cell.</p>
    <p num="10">
      These self-compensatory cells bring about inherently an enlarged viewing angle, which is not equal to that given by a CRT.
      <br/>
      The application for LCD provided with an optical compensatory sheet suitable for the self-compensatory cell (U.S. application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 749,894) has been already filed.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In the above-mentioned TN-LCD and the self-compensatory LCD, the display is conducted by selectively applying an electric field (voltage) in a direction perpendicular to the substrates of liquid crystal cell of LCD.
      <br/>
      To apply electric field or not gives variation of a direction of a molecular major axis of liquid crystal between the directions almost parallel and perpendicular to the substrates.
      <br/>
      Thus, display of black and white is mainly done by variation of direction of a molecular major axis in a plane perpendicular to the substrate.
      <br/>
      Therefore, retardation in the liquid crystal layer of LCD greatly varies depending upon variation of viewing angle, which results in variation of display color and contrast depending upon viewing angle.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A display mode utilizing a method applying electric field in a direction parallel to the substrates, which is not the above method applying electric field in a direction perpendicular to the substrates, has been proposed.
      <br/>
      The display mode is described in, for example, Asia Display '95 (The Institute of Telvision Engineers of Japan &amp; The Society for information Display, pages 577-580 and 707-710), and Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 7(1995)-261152, and is referred to as "IPS mode" (In-plane Switching).
    </p>
    <p num="13">The IPS mode described in Asia Display '95 (pages 577-580) is explained according to the description referring to FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="14">FIG. 1 (A) shows the arrangement of liquid crystal molecules and the condition of light in LCD utilizing IPS mode (IPS mode LCD) under no application of electric field (off state), and FIG. 1 (B) shows the arrangement of liquid crystal molecules and the condition of light in IPS mode LCD under application of electric field.</p>
    <p num="15">
      In FIG. 1 (A), nematic liquid crystal molecules 16 are aligned parallel to the substrates 13, 17 (i.e., homogeneous alignment), the substrate 13 having electrodes 14 thereon.
      <br/>
      An area of the substrate shown in FIG. 1 (A) usually corresponds to one pixel.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal molecules respond to an electric field (voltage) with being kept in the plane parallel to the substrates.
      <br/>
      The optic axis directions (i.e., major axis directions) of the homogeneously aligned nematic liquid crystal molecules are almost parallel to polarization axis of a polarizing plate 12.
      <br/>
      The polarizing plates 12 and 19 (polariser and analyzer) are set such that the axes are in a crisscross.
      <br/>
      The arrangement of the polarizing plates gives a pure black state under no application of electric field to the LCD, because light 11 incident upon the LCD is not polarized within a layer of the liquid crystal molecules (liquid crystal layer).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In the case that an electric field is applied in the direction parallel to the substrates, the major axes of liquid crystal molecules are deviated from the axis of the polarizing plate 12, as shown in FIG. 1 (B).
      <br/>
      As a result, when the light 11 incident upon the LCD is passed through the liquid crystal layer, phase retardation occurs in the light due to the different propagating rates of the extraordinary and ordinary rays.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the light 11 is polarized (by the phase retardation) to pass through the polarizing plate 19.
      <br/>
      Thus, light transmission of the LCD is increased with increase of electric field to give a white state.
      <br/>
      The reference number 18 indicates polarized state of light passed through the liquid crystal layer.
      <br/>
      The 45 degree deviation of the optic axis of the liquid crystal molecule brings about maximum transmittance.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMERY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      In IPS mode LCD mentioned above, the liquid crystal molecules are scarcely tilted to a plane perpendicular to the substrates of LCD, and therefore viewing angle characteristics are greatly improved.
      <br/>
      The inventors have found, however, that when the IPS mode LCD is viewed in the specific oblique direction, reversion of gradation and coloration are produced not to enlarge viewing angle in the specific direction.
      <br/>
      Thus, a CRT cannot be replaced in all respects by the IPS mode LCD, unless the above problems (reversion of gradation and coloration) are resolved.
    </p>
    <p num="18">It is a object of the invention to provide a liquid crystal display provided with an optical compensatory sheet which shows high contrast in an enlarged viewing angle and is almost free from reversion of gradation and coloration in an enlarged viewing angle.</p>
    <p num="19">It is another object of the invention to provide a liquid crystal display provided with an optical compensatory sheet which has an enlarged viewing angle and by which CRT can be replaced.</p>

    <p num="21">wherein an optical compensatory sheet is provided between at least one side of the liquid crystal cell and the polarizing sheet, and the optical compensatory sheet has an optically negative uniaxial property and an optic axis parallel to an plane of the sheet.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="27">
      The liquid crystal display of the invention has a basic structure comprising a liquid crystal cell which comprises a pair of transparent substrates at least one of which is provided with an electrode thereon and liquid crystal sealed therebetween, a polarizing sheet arranged on at least one side of the cell, and an optical compensatory sheet provided between at least one side of the liquid crystal cell.
      <br/>
      Further, in the LCD, the liquid crystal aligns parallel to a plane of the substrate and varies its direction of molecular major axis on a plane parallel to the plane of the substrate under variation of voltage applied to the liquid crystal cell.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The liquid crystal display of the invention preferably utilizes the IPS mode shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In the liquid crystal display of the invention, an optical compensatory sheet is further provided to the LCD of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The structure of the liquid crystal display of the invention is explained referring to FIG. 2 below.
      <br/>
      As for the direction of molecular major axis of liquid crystal under application of voltage in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the direction of major axis in FIG. 1 is almost perpendicular to the direction of the electric field, whereas the direction of major axis in FIG. 2 is almost parallel to the direction of the electric field.
      <br/>
      This is because the liquid crystals in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 are different from each other in dielectric anisotropy.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 2 (a) and (b) show the arrangement of liquid crystal molecules under no application of electric field (off state), and are a sectional view and a planar view, respectively.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 (c) and (d) show the arrangement of liquid crystal molecules under application of electric field (on state), and are a sectional view and a planar view, respectively.
      <br/>
      An area of the substrate shown in FIG. 2 usually corresponds to one pixel.
      <br/>
      Further, no application or application of electric field may correspond with application of electric field of a small or large voltage, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In FIG. 2 (a), a pair of belt-shaped electrodes 25, 27 are provided on a transparent substrate 23a, and a protective insulation layer 24a is formed on both the linear electrodes and the transparent substrate.
      <br/>
      On the reverse side (surface) of the transparent substrate 23a, an optical compensatory sheet 22a and a polarizing sheet 21a are provided in order.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      On a transparent substrate 23b faced to the transparent substrate 23a, a protective insulation layer 24b is formed and the reverse side of the transparent substrate 23b has an optical compensatory sheet 22b and a polarizing sheet 21b in order.
      <br/>
      Liquid crystal molecules 26a (generally having positive anisotropy of dielectric constant) are sealed between the transparent substrates 23a, 23b.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In FIG. 2 (b), which is a plane view of the LCD of FIG. 2 (a) (the upper composite including the substrate is removed), only the linear electrodes 25, 27 and the liquid crystal molecules 26a are shown.
      <br/>
      The arrow 28 indicates a rubbing direction of an orientation layer (not shown) provided on the linear electrode.
      <br/>
      The major axes of the liquid crystal molecules 26a are aligned parallel to the substrate (i.e., homogeneous alignment) along the rubbing direction (28).
      <br/>

      The direction of the polarization axis of the polarizing sheet 21a is parallel to that of the arrow 28 (the rubbing direction, the direction of the major axis), and the direction of the polarization axis of the polarizing sheet 21b is perpendicular to that of the arrow 28.
      <br/>
      Thus, light incident upon the polarizing sheet 21a is passed through a layer of the liquid crystal molecules with no occurrence of polarization, and therefore is completely interrupted by the polarizing sheet 21b to give a black display.

      The reference number 26b indicates the aligned liquid crystal molecules.

      In IPS mode shown in FIG. 2, switching of the direction of liquid crystal molecule within a plane parallel to the substrate is conducted.

      Therefore, variation of retardation depending upon viewing angle in the liquid crystal layer is greatly reduced, which results in enlarged viewing angle.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      According to the study of the inventors, however, in the case that the LCD of FIG. 2 is not provided with the optical compensatory sheet, the LCD does not show an excellent viewing angle characteristics.
      <br/>
      In more detail, when the LCD is viewed in the specific oblique direction, reversion of gradation and coloration are produced not to enlarge viewing angle in the specific viewing direction.
      <br/>
      This is because there is the specific direction that retardation within the liquid crystal layer does not uniformly vary with variation of voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In the IPS mode, birefringence mode is generally utilized.
      <br/>
      In the birefringence mode, coloration occurs in the display due to the above non-uniform variation of retardation in the specific viewing direction.

      In the IPS mode, an optical rotatory mode can be also utilized.

      In this case, a pair of substrates of the liquid crystal cell are arranged such that the rubbing directions of the orientation layers of the substrates are crossed with reference to each other so as to vary the directions of the major axes of liquid crystal molecules with increase of the thickness of liquid crystal layer.
    </p>
    <p num="42">In the invention, the above problems (occurrence of reversion of gradation and coloration in the specific oblique direction) are resolved by using an optical compensatory sheet (22a, 22b) having the specific optical characteristics (i.e., optically negative uniaxial property and an optic axis parallel or almost parallel to the plane of the sheet).</p>
    <p num="43">
      The IPS mode usually employs nematic liquid crystal, whose molecule has an optically positive uniaxial property.

      In FIG. 2 (a) and (b), the liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the substrates (homogeneous alignment).
      <br/>
      Mechanism for compensating the retardation produced by a liquid crystal cell using nematic liquid crystal (IPS mode) is explained referring to FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The main refractive indices of the nematic liquid crystal molecule and the main refractive indices of the optical compensatory sheet of the invention are shown in FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The optical compensatory sheet 31 is provided on the liquid crystal layer 32.

      The optical compensatory sheet 31 has an index ellipsoid 33 therein, and the liquid crystal layer 32 has an index ellipsoid 34 of liquid crystal molecule having an optically positive uniaxial property therein.
      <br/>
      The index ellipsoid 34 of liquid crystal molecule satisfies the condition of nx.apprxeq.nz &lt;ny (nx and ny are main refractive indices within the substrate and nz is a main refractive index in the thickness direction of the layer).
      <br/>
      The index ellipsoid 33 of the optical compensatory sheet satisfies the condition of nx.apprxeq.nz &gt;ny (nx and ny are main refractive indices within the sheet and nz is a main refractive index in the thickness direction of the sheet), i.e., the index ellipsoid 33 has optically negative uniaxial property and an optic axis parallel to the plane of the sheet (the plane of the substrate of the cell)).
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      FIG. 3 indicates that the light in various directions passed through the liquid crystal layer 32 is compensated by the optical compensatory sheet 31.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the light entered from the above-mentioned specific direction showing non-uniform variation of retardation is also compensated by the optical compensatory sheet 31.
      <br/>
      Thus, the use of the optical compensatory sheet of the invention gives the liquid crystal display having an enlarged viewing angle equal to that of CRT, in which leak of light does not occur when black display is viewed from various directions.

      The liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the substrates (homogeneous alignment) as shown in FIG. 2 (a) and (b).

      However, the directions of the major axes of liquid crystal molecules may vary with increase of the thickness of liquid crystal layer to twist the directions of the major axes along the thickness direction, as mentioned above.
      <br/>
      In this case, the operation mode of the display does not follow a birefringence mode but an optical rotatory mode.
      <br/>
      To optically compensate the liquid crystal layer, it is preferred to use an optical compensatory sheet whose optic axis is twisted in the direction reverse to the twisted direction of the major axes of liquid crystal molecules.
      <br/>
      Such an optical compensatory sheet can be, for example, prepared by superposing optical compensatory sheets having a different direction of optic axis one another.

      The optical compensatory sheet employed in the invention can be also prepared using the liquid crystalline discotic compound.

      In more detail, the sheet can be obtained by the steps of: forming an orientation layer for homeotropic alignment on the transparent support (e.g., triacetyl cellulose film), coating a solution containing the liquid crystalline discotic compound on the orientation layer, drying the coated layer to form a discotic compound layer, and heating the discotic compound layer to a liquid crystalline phase (e.g., discotic nematic phase).
      <br/>
      The liquid crystalline discotic compound has its optic axis in a direction perpendicular to the discotic plane, and therefore the discotic plane is shifted to the direction perpendicular to the support by forming the discotic compound layer on the orientation layer, whereby the optic axis of the discotic compound layer is in the plane of the discotic compound layer.
      <br/>
      However, it is usually difficult that the discotic plane is shifted to the direction perpendicular to the support (90 degrees) by using only one orientation layer.
