    <p num="2">The present invention relates to certain neurotrophically active 1-(4-piperidyl)-benzimidazoles and their use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and for the regeneration or prevention of degeneration of lesioned and damaged neurons.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Growth (or neurotrophic) factors promote the differentiation, growth and survival of numerous peripheral and central nervous system neurons during development and adulthood.
      <br/>
      The molecular characteristics, regulation and signal transduction mechanism for a number of neurotrophic factors have been identified.
      <br/>
      The most therapeutically promising of these molecules are nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Available data suggests that neurotrophic factors will be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
      <br/>
      Additionally neurotrophic factors have shown beneficial effects in animal models of peripheral nerve damage and toxin induced neuropathies (CNS Drugs, 2(6), 465-478 (1994)).
    </p>
    <p num="5">Various rat studies predict that compounds mimicking or enhancing the function of NGF can rescue septal colinergic neurons and alleviate benign forgetfulness and the memory impairment seen in senile dementia ( Science, Vol. 264, 772-774 (1994)).</p>
    <p num="6">Recent studies have shown that NGF has a neuroprotective effect on hippocampal neurons after cerebral ischaemia, which predicts a potential therapeutic role for NGF in the treatment of cerebral ischaemic neuronal damage (NeuroReport, vol. 6, No 4, 669-672 (1995)).</p>
    <p num="7">
      Growth factors initiate their biological action by binding to specific cell surface receptors.
      <br/>
      Binding of the growth factor to its receptor activates the intracellular signal transduction, leading to the generation of various second messengers and activation of enzyme cascades, involving tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C, and culminates in a biological effect.
      <br/>
      The intracellular signal transduction pathway is not yet fully understood.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      NGF and related neurotrophins are large peptides, which makes them unlikely therapeutic candidates.
      <br/>
      Poor pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g. poor oral absorption and short in vivo half life), and administration to the target organs represent the major problems.
    </p>
    <p num="9">The identification of compounds with physicochemical properties different from the neurotrophins but capable of interaction with the neurotrophin-receptors is considered to be extremely important for the development of effective treatments of diseases and disorders responsive to neurotrophic factors.</p>
    <p num="10">
      The inventors of the present invention have found that the 1-(4-piperidyl)-benzimidazoles of formula (I) possess valuable neurotrophic activity.
      <br/>
      The neurotrophic activity found by the inventors of the present invention has not been ascribed to a specific step in the interaction between NGF and its receptor or in the NGF signal transduction pathway.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The neurotrophic activity of the compounds of formula (I), make them useful in the treatment of various nerve degenerative diseases, such as for example Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and in alleviating benign forgetfulness and the memory impairment seen in senile dementia or in connection with neurodegenerative diseases.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the compounds are indicated to be useful in the treatment of neuropathy and especially peripheral neuropathy caused by e.g. genetic abnormalities and other conditions such as diabetes, polio, herpes and AIDS, and most especially neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy experienced by most cancer patients after or during chemotherapy.
    </p>
    <p num="12">The compounds of formula (I) are considered to be particularly useful in the treatment of traumatic lesions of peripheral nerves, the medulla, and/or the spinal cord, and in the treatment of cerebral ischaemia, e.g. ischaemic neuronal damage following cardiac arrest, stroke, or postasphyxial brain damage in newborns, or following near-drowning.</p>
    <heading>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for the treatment of disorders or diseases responsive to the activity of neurotrophic agents, such as traumatic lesions of peripheral nerves, the medulla, and/or the spinal cord, cerebral ischaemic neuronal damage, neuropathy and especially peripheral neuropathy, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or any other neurodegenerative disease, and memory impairment connected to dementia.
      <br/>
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for the prevention of the degenerative changes connected with the above diseases and disorders.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Still another object of the present invention is to provide novel 1-(4-piperidyl)-benzimidazoles, and novel pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds which will be useful in the treatment of or prevention of the ailments mentioned above.</p>

      Racemic compounds of the present invention can thus be resolved into their optical antipodes, e.g., by fractional crystallization of d- or I- (tartrates, mandelates, or camphorsulphonate) salts for example.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the instant invention may also be resolved by the formation of diastereomeric amides by reaction of the compounds of the present invention with an optically active activated carboxylic acid such as that derived from (+) or (-) phenylalanine, (+) or (-) phenylglycine, (+) or (-) camphanic acid or by the formation of diastereomeric carbamates by reaction of the compounds of the present invention with an optically active chloroformate or the like.

    <heading>TAXOL-INDUCED LOSS OF PAIN SENSATION</heading>
    <p num="139">
      Introduction: Taxol is an anticancer drug against solid tumors but the development of peripheral neuropathy has been dose limiting (Wiernik et al. 1987, Lipton et al. 1989).
      <br/>
      Taxol has also been shown to induce peripheral neuropathy in mice, and the effect can be inhibited by Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) (Apfel et al. 1991).
      <br/>
      We have tested whether the test compound could prevent taxol-induced peripheral neuropathy in mice with a paradigm similar to Apfel's experiments.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      Method: In all experiments female NMRI mice (Bomholtgaard Breeding Center) habituated to the laboratory for at least 16 hours and with tap water and altromin food ad libitum were used.
      <br/>
      After taxol administration the tail flick threshold was evaluated the following way:
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      Female NMRI mice were separated into 5 groups (n=15) and administered 10% Tween 80 (0.3 ml i.p.), 20 mg/kg taxol i.p. or 20 mg/kg taxol plus 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg test compound s.c. daily for 6 consecutive days.
      <br/>
      In order to protect the animals from the consequences of insufficient nourishment all groups were administered 1 ml BabyminA p.o. daily.
      <br/>
      BabyminA is a breast milk substitute consisting of water, milk, electrolytes and vitamins.
      <br/>
      Test compound and BabyminA were also administered on the day after the discontinuation of taxol treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      The taxol treatment decreased the food and water intake in a reversible manner.
      <br/>
      Even though the animals were administered 1 ml BabyminA daily they lost in body weight (results not shown) but only to a limited extent and the mice were generally in a good condition and survived throughout the experiment.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      Two days after the discontinuation of taxol treatment the tail flick threshold was measured: The mice were, one at a time, gently restrained in a 50 ml syringe with the tail exposed.
      <br/>
      The tail was submerged into hot water at 45, 47, 49, 51, 53 and 55 (degree)  C. for 5 sec and the lowest temperature inducing a tail flick response was noted for each mouse. (If a mouse flicked at e.g. 49 (degree)  C., it was not tested at higher temperatures).
    </p>
    <p num="144">The results, obtained and presented in FIG. 2, show that 1-(1-n-butyl-4-piperidyl)-benzimidazol-2-one at 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg very efficiently prevents the increase in tail flick threshold induced by taxol.</p>
    <p num="145">The compound, 1-(1-n-butyl-4-piperidyl)-benzimidazol-2-one has also been tested for its neuroprotective effect in the following animal ischemia model:</p>
    <p num="146">TRANSIENT FOREBRAIN ISCHEMIA MODEL (2-VO GERBILS)</p>
    <p num="147">
      Gerbils were anaesthetized with halothane, right and left carotid arteries located and occluded for 4 minutes.
      <br/>
      Animals were kept warm before and after the operation using heating lamps.
      <br/>
      During the operation the gerbils were placed on heating plates, body temperature controlled and maintained at 37.+- 0 (slashed zero) 5 (degree)  C. Four days later, the animals were sacrificed, brains removed and cooled to -70 (degree)  C. Thereafter, the brains were sectioned in 20 mm thick sections of which 5-7 with hippocampal tissue were selected and stained with hematoxylin eosine (HE).
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      Based upon the degree of hippocampal damage, each hippocampus was categorised into one of four groups (Group 1: no damage in the CA1-layer; Group 2: the CA1-layer partly damaged; Group 3: the CA1-layer completely damaged; and Group 4: damage in more than just the CA1-layer).
      <br/>
      The total ischemic score was obtained as the sum of the right and left scores.
