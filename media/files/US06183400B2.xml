      <br/>
      An attachment or accessory for exercise devices such as barbells, dumbbells, weight training machines or any device utilizing a cylindrical bar.
      <br/>
      The accessory or attachment is intended for strengthening a user's targeted muscle without the necessity of a forceful grip and provides a safer, more effective, and efficient workout.
      <br/>
      The device is made up of two parts, which are hinged together, to form a grasping area of 16 square inches as opposed to 4 square inches on a regular one inch diameter bar.
      <br/>
      The unit is secured to the bar with a latch.
      <br/>
      There is a palm heel to prevent the unit from rotating and to help keep the shaft approximately 90 degrees to the hand.
      <br/>
      The strap uniformly spreads the weight of the exercise device over the back of the hand reducing the need of forceful grip for lifting the weights when the hand is over the weight.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">A method and apparatus for increasing the effectiveness of weight training and strength training, as well as in the rehabilitation and therapy environment by allowing the user to more effectively focus an exercise on the targeted muscle.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The use of weight training and strength training equipment for strengthening muscles is well known.
      <br/>
      Through the years, inventors of these devices have continually sought improved methods for isolating a targeted muscle to provide increased effectiveness to the user for each exercise repetition.
      <br/>
      An ongoing problem in this area of development is the fact that almost any exercise of the biceps, triceps, or deltoids requires a gripping and grasping action that further involves the conjunctive muscles of the arm.
      <br/>
      The blood flow is restricted, the blood pressure rises and the muscles fatigue more rapidly.
      <br/>
      As part of an ongoing study on the subject, Dr.
      <br/>
      Banks from Howard University has stated that the cumulative effect of this gripping action is to reduce the effectiveness of the exercise by approximately 30%.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,009,416 to Caruthers disclosed a grip facilitating handle which can be attached to the handle of an exercise device to allow the user to manipulate or control the device without the necessity of a forceful grip.
      <br/>
      This handle grip, however, requires the use of a cumbersome C-clamp, which must be added to the base invention, to prevent the handle of the exercise device from rotating in the grip facilitating handle device.
      <br/>
      This handle grip also requires the user's thumb to rest on the same side as the fingers.
      <br/>
      The subject invention differs from this prior art by: (1) by eliminating the need for a dual wall grip, thus reducing manufacturing costs and making one size fit all user hands; (2) allowing the user to grip the handle more naturally, with the thumb opposed to the fingers; (3) the use of strategically placed rubber pads to eliminate the rotation of the handle of the exercise device within the grip; and (4) allowing the user to easily remove the grip and reattach it to handles of other exercise devices with various diameters.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,487,412 to Meeko disclosed a weight lifting grip to increase the user's gripping power and weight training level on weight training equipment.
      <br/>
      This device, however, uses a U-shaped cradle to hold the handle of the exercise device, which allows the handle of the exercise device to rotate in the grip.
      <br/>
      This device also requires the user's thumb to rest on the same side as the fingers.
      <br/>
      The subject invention differs from this prior art by: (1) allowing the use of a relaxed natural gripping position, with the thumb opposing the fingers, around a grip that is contoured to closely match the natural contours of the hand; (2) the use of strategically placed rubber pads to eliminate the rotation of the handle of the exercise device within the grip; and (3) allowing the user to easily remove the grip and reattach it to handles of other exercise devices with various diameters.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,342,268 to Caruthers disclosed an exercise device intended for strengthening a user's target muscle, wherein the user may manipulate the device without the necessity of a forceful grip that employs the user's conjunctive muscles.
      <br/>
      However, this exercise device is a self contained and can not be used to modify any other exercise device which requires a forceful grip.
      <br/>
      Also this device requires the user's thumb to rest on the same side as the fingers.
      <br/>
      The subject invention differs from this prior art by: (1) being an accessory or grip to be used with the user's existing exercise devices; and (2) allowing the user's to use a more natural grip with the thumb opposed to the fingers.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to alleviate the deficiencies and disadvantages of the prior art and to provide a safer, more efficient and effective workout.
      <br/>
      The Hand at Rest Device does this by providing a grip to be used on an exercising device, possessing a bar or shaft type handle, wherein the user's hand is substantially in a relaxed natural gripping position, with the thumb opposing the fingers, around a grip that is contoured to closely match the natural contours of the hand, rather than being tightly closed around the handle, such that a forceful grip is not required to control the exercise device to which it is attached.
      <br/>
      Thus the use of the present invention increases the blood flow to the targeted muscles; decreases the fatigue of the targeted muscles, and decreases blood pressure, providing a safer and more effective workout for the user.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      It is another object of the present invention to provide a grip with an adjustable and removable strap, which in up to 53% of all upper body exercise positions distributes the weight of the exercise device over the back of the user's hand, thus allowing the user to utilize a relaxed grip.
      <br/>
      The adjustable strap also provides additional safety and support to the user.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      It is another object of the present invention to provide a grip that can be used on various size diameter bar handles of exercising devices so that the user can easily use the same grip on many different pieces of exercise equipment.
      <br/>
      The enclosed embodiment shows a grip that fits bar handles that are 1"11/8" and 11/4" in diameter, however the invention is not intended to be limited to these three diameter handles, nor is it intended to be limited to a grip that fits only three different diameters.
      <br/>
      The invention includes a grip with a single latch or any type of multiple latch that will fit over a bar or shaft type handle ranging from 1/8" diameter to 3" diameter.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      It is another object of the present invention to provide a grip to be used on an exercising device, possessing a bar type handle, that will not rotate about the axis of the bar handle of the exercise device to which it is attached.
      <br/>
      The Hand at Rest Device does this by the use of rubber pads that are fit into grooves at strategically positioned locations, such that the device will grip the various diameter shafts, thus eliminating the inefficiencies in exercising with a grip that is free to slip around the axis of the bar handle of the exercise device to which it is attached.
    </p>
    <p num="11">It is another object of the present invention to provide a grip that can be attached and removed from the bar handle of an exercising device quickly and efficiently; so that the user can easily use the same grip on many different pieces of exercise equipment.</p>
