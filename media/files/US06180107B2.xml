    <p num="2">
      A new class of cell-derived dimeric mitogens with apparently restricted specificity for vascular endothelial cells has recently been identified and generally designated vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF).
      <br/>
      The mitogen has been purified from: conditioned growth media of rat glioma cells, �Conn et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 2628-2632 (1990)�; conditioned growth media of bovine pituitary folliculo stellate cells �Ferrara and Henzel, Biochem.

      <br/>
      VEGF I has distinct structural similarities to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a mitogen for connective tissue cells but not vascular endothelial cells from large vessels.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      The present invention relates to a unique vascular endothelial cell growth factor (designated VEGF II), isolated and purified from glioma cell conditioned medium, which exhibits mitogenic stimulation of vascular endothelial cells.
      <br/>
      Glioma is defined herein as any neoplasm derived from one of the various types of cells that form the interstitial tissue of the central nervous system including brain, spinal cord, posterior pituitary gland and retina.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the scope of the present invention is intended to include the unique growth factor isolated and purified from any mammalian glioma tissue or other cells including cell lines.
      <br/>
      Cell lines include, but are not limited to, glioma-derived cell lines such as C6, hs 683 and GS-9L; glioblastomas such as A-172 and T98G; neuroblastomas such as IMR-32 and SK-N-MC; neurogliomas such as H4; tetromas such as XB-2; astrocytomas such as U-87 MG and U-373 MG; embryonal carcinomas and non-transformed glial or astrocyte cell lines, and the human medulloblastoma line TE 671, with GS-9L and TE 671 being preferred.
      <br/>
      VEGF II is present and can be isolated from rat tissue including ovary, heart and kidney.
      <br/>
      Anterior pituitary tumor cell lines such as GH3 and Hs 199 may also be used.
      <br/>
      Although the VEGF of this invention is described as being isolated from rat cells, the same or substantially similar growth factor may be isolated from other mammalian cells, including human cells.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Vascular endothelial growth factor II may exist in various microheterogeneous forms which are isolated from one or more of the various cells or tissues described above.
      <br/>
      Microheterogeneous forms as used herein refer to a single gene product, that is a peptide produced from a single gene unit of DNA, which is structurally modified at the mRNA level or following translation.
      <br/>
      Peptide and protein are used interchangeably herein.
      <br/>
      The microheterogeneous forms will all have equivalent mitogenic activities.
      <br/>
      Biological activity and biologically active are used interchangeably and are herein defined as the ability of VEGF II to stimulate DNA synthesis in target cells including vascular endothelial cells as described below which results in cell proliferation.
      <br/>
      The modifications may take place either in vivo or during the isolation and purification process.
      <br/>
      In vivo modification results from, but is not limited to, proteolysis, glycosylation, phosphorylation, deamidation or acetylation at the N-terminus.
      <br/>
      Proteolysis may include exoproteolysis wherein one or more terminal amino acids are sequentially, enzymatically cleaved to produce microheterogeneous forms which have fewer amino acids than the original gene product.
      <br/>
      Proteolysis may also include endoproteolytic modification that results from the action of endoproteases which cleave the peptide at specific locations within the amino acid sequence.
      <br/>
      Similar modifications can occur during the purification process which also results in production of microheterogeneous forms.
      <br/>
      The most common modification occurring during purification is proteolysis which is generally held to a minimum by the use of protease inhibitors.
      <br/>
      Under most conditions one or more microheterogeneous forms are present following purification of native VEGF II.
      <br/>
      Native VEGF II refers to VEGF II isolated and purified from cells that produce VEGF II.
      <br/>
      Vascular endothelial growth factor II may also exist in various alternatively spliced forms which is defined herein as the production of related mRNAs by differential processing of exons.
      <br/>
      Exons are defined as those parts of the DNA sequence of a eukaryotic gene that code for the final protein product.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Glioma cells such as the rat cell line GS-9L are grown to confluence in tissue culture flasks, about 175 cm2, in a cell culture medium such as Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with about 10% newborn calf serum (NCS).
      <br/>
      When the cells reach confluence the culture medium is removed, the cell layers are washed with Ca++, Mg++ -free phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and are removed from the flasks by treatment with a solution of trypsin, about 0.1%, and EDTA, about 0.04%. The cells, about 1 * 108, are pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in about 1500 ml of DMEM containing about 5% NCS and plated into a ten level cell factory (NUNC), 6,000 cm2 surface area.
      <br/>
      The cells are incubated for about 48 to about 96 hours (hr), with 72 hr preferred, at about 37 (degree)  C. in an atmosphere of about 5% CO2.
      <br/>
      Following incubation the medium is removed and the cell factories are washed about 3 times with PBS.
      <br/>
      About 1500 ml of fresh culture media is added containing about a 1:2 mixture of Ham's-F12/DMEM containing about 15 mM Hepes, about 5  MU g/ml insulin, about 10  MU g/ml transferrin and with or without about 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin.
      <br/>
      This media is replaced with fresh media after about 24 hr and collected every 48 hr thereafter.
      <br/>
      The collected conditioned media are filtered through Whatmen -1 paper to remove cell debris and stored at about -20 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The GS-9L conditioned medium is thawed and brought to pH 6.0 with 1 M HCl.
      <br/>
      The initial purification step consists of cation exchange chromatography using a variety of cation exchangers on a variety of matrices such as CM Sephadex C-50, Pharmacia Mono S, Zetachrom SP and Polyaspartic Acid WCX (Nest Group) with CM Sephadex C-50 (Pharmacia) being preferred.
      <br/>
      The VEGF-containing culture media is mixed with CM Sephadex C-50 at about 2 gm per about 20 L of the conditioned medium and stirred at low speed for about 24 hr at 4 (degree)  C. The resin is allowed to settle and the excess liquid is removed.
      <br/>
      The resin slurry is packed into a column and the remaining culture media is removed.
      <br/>
      Unbound protein is washed from the column with 0.05 M sodium phosphate, about pH 6.0, containing 0.15 M NaCl. The VEGF II is eluted with about 0.05 M sodium phosphate, about pH 6.0, containing about 0.6 M NaCl.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The active fractions collected from the CM Sephadex C-50 column are further fractionated by lectin affinity chromatography for additional purification of VEGF II.
      <br/>
      The lectins which may bind VEGF II include, but are not limited to, lectins which specifically bind mannose residues such as concanavalin A (Con A) and lens culinaris agglutinin, lectins which bind N-acetylglucosamine such as wheat germ agglutinin, lectins that bind galactose or galactosamine and lectins which bind sialic acids, with Con A being preferred.
      <br/>
      A 0.9 cm diameter column containing about 5 ml packed volume of Con A agarose (Vector Laboratories) is washed and equilibrated with about 0.05 M sodium acetate about pH 6.0, containing about 1 mM CaCl2, about 1 mM MnCl2 and about 0.6 M NaCl. The unbound protein is washed from the column with equilibration buffer.
      <br/>
      The VEGF II is eluted with about 0.1 M NaCl buffer containing about 0.32 M a-methyl mannoside and about 0.28 M a-methyl glucoside.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The VEGF II active eluate from the Con A column is applied to a Polyaspartic Acid WCX cation exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column, 4.6 mm * 250 mm, pre-equilibrated in about 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6 0 (slashed zero)  The column is eluted with a linear gradient of about 0 to 0.75 M NaCl in the phosphate buffer over about 60 minutes (min).
      <br/>
      The flow rate is maintained at about 0.75 ml/min collecting 0.75 ml fractions.
      <br/>
      Vascular endothelial growth factor activity is present in fractions eluting between approximately 21.7 and 28.5 ml, see FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The active fractions eluted from the polyaspartic WCX column that contain VEGF II are pooled, adjusted to about pH 7.0 and loaded onto a 1 * 10 cm column of Pharmacia Chelating Sepharose 6B charged with an excess of copper chloride and equilibrated in about 0.05 M sodium phosphate, about pH 7.0, containing about 2 M NaCl and about 0.5 mM imidazole (A buffer).
      <br/>
      VEGF II is eluted from the column with a gradient from 0-20% B over 10 minutes, 20-35% B over 45 minutes and 35-100% B over 5 minutes at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, where B buffer is 0.05 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing about 2 M NaCl and 100 mM imidazole.
      <br/>
      The active fractions containing VEGF II activity eluted between about 12.6 and 22.8 ml of the gradient effluent volume, see FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The pooled fractions containing VEGF II activity eluted from the metal chelate column are loaded onto a 4.6 mm * 5 cm Vydac C4 reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) column (5  MU m particle size) previously equilibrated in solvent A (0.1% TFA).
      <br/>
      The column is eluted with a linear gradient of about 0 to 30% solvent B over 15 min, 30% B for an additional 15 min, then 30-45% B over 22.5 min and finally 45-100% B over 5.5 min. Solvent B consists of solvent A containing 67% acetonitrile (v/v).
      <br/>
      The flow rate is maintained at about 0.75 ml/min and fractions are collected every minute.
      <br/>
      The homogeneous VEGF II elutes from the C4 column under these conditions at between about 32 and about 38 ml of the gradient effluent volume, see FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Purity of the protein is determined by sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in 12.5% crosslinked gels using the technique of Laemmli, Nature 227: 680-684 (1970).
      <br/>
      The silver stained gels show VEGF II to consist of one band under non-reducing conditions with an approximate apparent molecular mass of about 58 kilodaltons (kDa).
      <br/>
      When a sample containing the microheterogeneous forms of VEGF II is separated under reducing conditions it migrates as two about 23 kDa subunits.
      <br/>
      The purification process results in VEGF II that is essentially free of other mammalian cell products, such as proteins.
      <br/>
      Recombinantly derived VEGF II will also be free of mammalian cell products.

    <p num="14">
      Biological activity is determined by mitogenic assay using mammalian vascular endothelial cells.
      <br/>
      Human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells are plated on gelatin-coated dishes at a density of about 5000 cells per well in about 500  MU l of Medium 199 (M199) containing about 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS).
      <br/>
      Samples to be assayed are added at the time of plating.
      <br/>
      The tissue culture plates are incubated at about 37 (degree)  C. for about 12 hr and about 2 microcuries of tritiated thymidine (NEN, 20 Ci/mmol) is added per ml of assay medium (1.0  MU Ci/well).
      <br/>
      The plates are incubated for a further 60 hr, the assay medium is removed and the plates are washed with Hanks balanced salt solution containing about 20 mM Hepes, about pH 7.5, and about 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin.
      <br/>
      The cells are lysed and the labelled DNA solubilized with about 200  MU l of a solution containing about 2 gm of sodium carbonate and about 400 mg sodium hydroxide in about 100 ml water.
      <br/>
      The incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting.
      <br/>
      The concentration of VEGF which elicited a half-maximal mitogenic response in HUVE cells was approximately 2 +- 1 ng/ml.
      <br/>
      The glycosaminoglycan heparin, which is required in these assays at a level of 10-100  MU g/ml to promote a response to a positive control, acidic fibroblast growth factor, does not enhance mitogenic stimulation of these cells by VEGF II.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      A purified about 1-2  MU g sample of VEGF II is reduced in about 0.1 M Tris, about pH 9.5, with about 0.1% EDTA, about 6 M guanidinium chloride and about 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for about 2 hr at about 50 (degree)  C. The reduced protein is carboxymethylated for about 1 hr in a solution containing about 9.2  MU M of unlabelled iodoacetic acid and 2.8  MU M of 14 C-iodoacetic acid in about 0.7 M Tris,about pH 7.8, and about 0.1% EDTA and about 6 M guanidinium chloride.
      <br/>
      The protein is carboxymethylated for about 1 hr at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The protein is isolated after reduction and carboxymethylation by RP-HPLC chromatography on a Vydac C4 column, about 4.6 mm * 5 cm.
      <br/>
      The protein is loaded onto a column pre-equilibrated with about 0.1% TFA and eluted by a 45 ml linear gradient from about 0.1% TFA to 0.1% TFA/67% acetonitrile at a flow rate of about 0.75 ml/min. The reduced and carboxymethylated protein eluted as two peaks at approximately 25 and 28 ml with the proportion being approximately equal as determined by monitoring absorbance at 210 nm.

      <br/>
      The protein showing the peak of absorbance eluting at approximately 28 ml (A subunit or monomer) yielded an amino terminal sequence of:
      <br/>
      Ala Pro Thr Thr Glu Gly Glu Gln Lys Ala His Glu Val Val

    </p>
    <p num="18">
      plus a nearly equal amount of a truncated form of the same sequence missing the first three amino acid residues.
      <br/>
      The missing Xxx residue corresponds to an Asn residue in the cloned cDNA, see below.
      <br/>
      Since this missing Asn occurs in a classical Asn Xxx Ser/Thr N-glycosylation sequence it is presumed to be glycosylated.
      <br/>
      The A subunit and the total of both B subunits are recovered in nearly equal amounts supporting the interpretation that the two peptides combine to form an AB heterodimer in VEGF II.

      A monomer is defined as a subunit that cannot form an oligomeric unit.
      <br/>
      Expression of the recombinant VEGF II genes (recombinant DNA) is accomplished by a number of different host cells which contain at least one of a number of expression vectors.
      <br/>
      Expression vectors are defined herein as DNA sequences that are required for the transcription of cloned copies of recombinant DNA sequences or genes and the translation of their mRNAs in an appropriate host.
      <br/>
      Such vectors can be used to express genes in a variety of hosts such as bacteria, blue-green algae, yeast cells, insect cells, plant cells and animal cells, with mammalian cells being preferred.
      <br/>
      The genes may also be expressed in a number of virus systems.
      <br/>
      Specifically designated vectors allow the shuttling of DNA between bacteria-yeast, bacteria-plant or bacteria-animal cells.

      The high Cys content and glycoslyation of the A and B subunits along with the structure of the homo- and heterodimers suggests that expression of biologically active proteins is carried out in animal cells.

      Transformants expressing dhfr are selected on media lacking nucleosides and are exposed to increasing concentrations of methotrexate.

      The dhfr and VEGF II genes are thus coamplified leading to a stable cell line capable of expressing high levels of VEGF II.

      The plasmid is designed to include either an A subunit and a B subunit or two A or B subunits.
      <br/>
      The two cDNAs are operably attached so that the protein produced will be dimeric and will have VEGF II biological activity.

      The ability of the various species of VEGF II to stimulate the division of vascular endothelial cells makes this protein in all microheterogeneous forms and alternative splicing forms useful as a pharmaceutical agent.

      The protein as used herein is intended to include all microheterogeneous forms as previously described.

      The novel method for the stimulation of vascular endothelial cells comprises treating a sample of the desired vascular endothelial cells in a nutrient medium with mammalian VEGF II, preferably human or rat, at a concentration of about 1-10 ng/ml.
      <br/>
      If the vascular endothelial cell growth is conducted in vitro, the process requires the presence of a nutrient medium such as DMEM or a modification thereof and a low concentration of calf or bovine serum such as about 0 to 2% by volume.

      The novel growth factors of this invention are useful for the coverage of artificial blood vessels with vascular endothelial cells.
      <br/>
      Vascular endothelial cells from the patient would be obtained by removal of a small segment of peripheral blood vessel or capillary-containing tissue and the desired cells would be grown in culture in the presence of VEGF II and any other supplemental components that might be required for growth.
      <br/>
      After growth of adequate numbers of endothelial cells in culture to cover a synthetic polymeric blood vessel the cells would be plated on the inside surface of the vessel, such as fixed umbilical vein, which is then implanted in the patient.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, tubular supports are coated in vitro with VEGF II prior to implantation into a patient.
      <br/>
      Following implantation endothelial cells migrate into and grow on the artificial surface.
      <br/>
      Prior coating of the artificial vessel either covalently or noncovalently, with proteins such as fibrin, collagen, fibronectin or laminin would be performed to enhance attachment of the cells to the artificial surface.
      <br/>
      The cell-lined artificial vessel would then be surgically implanted into the patient and, being lined with the patients own cells, would be immunologically compatible.
      <br/>
      The non-thrombogenic endothelial cell lining should decrease the incidence of clot formation on the surface of the artificial vessel and thereby decrease the tendency of vessel blockage or embolism elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The novel proteins are also useful for the production of artificial vessels.
      <br/>
      Vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells from the patient would be obtained and grown separately in culture.
      <br/>
      The endothelial cells would be grown in the presence of VEGF II as outlined above.
      <br/>
      The smooth muscle would be grown in culture by procedures well known in the art.
      <br/>
      A tubular mesh matrix of a biocompatible polymer (either a synthetic polymer, with or without a coating of proteins, or a non-immunogenic biopolymeric material such as surgical suture thread) would be used to support the culture growth of the smooth muscle cells on the exterior side and vascular endothelial cells on the interior surface.
      <br/>
      Once the endothelial cells form a confluent monolayer on the inside surface and multiple layers of smooth muscle cells cover the outside, the vessel is implanted into the patient.

      The novel peptides can also be used for the induction of tissue repair or growth.
      <br/>
      The pure VEGF II would be used to induce and promote growth of tissue by inducing vascular growth and/or repair.
      <br/>
      The peptide can be used either topically for tissue repair or intravascularly for vascular repair.
      <br/>
      For applications involving neovascularization and healing of surface wounds the formulation would be applied directly at a rate of about 10 ng to about 1 mg/cm2 /day.
      <br/>
      For vascular repair VEGF II is given intraveneously at a rate of about 1  MU g to about 100  MU g/kg/day of body weight.
      <br/>
      For internal vascular growth, the formulation would be released directly into the region to be neovascularized either from implanted slow release polymeric material or from slow release pumps or repeated injections.

      The release rate in either case is about 100 ng to about 100  MU g/day/cm3.

      Aliquots of the purified protein (1-2  MU g) were vacuum evaporated to dryness in acid-washed 10 * 75 mm glass tubes and reduced for 2 hr at 50 (degree)  C. in 100  MU l of 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 9.5, and 6 M guanidinium chloride containing 0.1% EDTA and 20 mM DTT (Calbiochem, Ultrol grade) under an argon atmosphere.
      <br/>
      The reduced protein was subsequently carboxymethylated for 1 hr at 20 (degree)  C. by the addition of 100  MU l of 0.7 M Tris, pH 7.8, containing 0.1% EDTA, 6 M guanidinium chloride, 9.2  MU M unlabeled iodoacetic acid and 50  MU Ci of iodo�2-14 C�acetic acid (17.9 mCi/mmole, Amersham).
      <br/>
      After completion of the carboxymethylation, the mixture was loaded directly onto a 4.6 mm * 5.0 cm Vydac C4 column which had been preequilibrated in 0.1% TFA. The reduced and carboxymethylated protein was repurified by elution with a 45 min linear gradient of 0 to 67% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min and stored in this elution solution at 4 (degree)  C. The reduced and carboxymethylated protein eluted as two peaks at approximately 25 and 28 ml that were of approximately equal area as determined by monitoring absorbance at 210 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      Samples of the two protein subunits isolated after reduction and carboxymethylation were each applied to polybrene-coated glass fiber filters and their N-terminal sequences were determined by Edman degradation in an ABI gas phase microsequencer in conjunction with an ABI 120A on line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer following manufacturers instructions.
      <br/>
      The peak of absorbance eluting at approximately 28 ml (A subunit) yielded an amino terminal sequence APTTEGEQKAHEVV identical to VEGF I. The peak of absorbance eluting at approximately 25 ml (B subunit) yielded the N-terminal sequence ALSAGN(X)STEMEVVPFNEV plus a nearly equal amount of a truncated form of the same sequence missing the first three residues.
      <br/>
      The missing X residue corresponds to an Asn in the cloned sequence.
      <br/>
      Since this missing Asn occurs in a classical Asn-X-Ser/Thr N-glycosylation sequence it is presumed to be glycosylated.
      <br/>
      The A and sum of the B chain peptides were recovered in nearly equal amounts supporting the interpretation that the two peptides combine to form an AB heterodimer in VEGF II.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Reduced and carboxymethylated A and B subunits (650 ng each) were each dried by vacuum evaporation in acid-washed 10 * 75 mm glass tubes.
      <br/>
      Lys C protease (50 ng, Boehringer Mannheim), an enzyme that cleaves on the carboxyl terminal side of lysine residues, was added to each tube in 100  MU l of 25 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 0.1% EDTA. The substrate protein subunits were separately digested at 37 (degree)  C. for 8 hr and the resulting polypeptides resolved by RP-HPLC chromatography on a 4.6 mm * 25 cm Vydac C18 column equilibrated in 0.1% TFA. Polypeptides were fractionated by elution with a 2 hr linear gradient of 0-67% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min at 20 (degree)  C. Individual peaks were manually collected and stored in this elution solution at 4 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The amino acid sequences of the isolated peptides were then determined using Edman degradation in an ABI gas phase sequenator in conjunction with the ABI 120 A on line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Applied Biosystems Int.).
      <br/>
      The peptide sequences are shown in the following FIGS. 5 through 5C and FIGS. 6 through 6B.
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequence of Lys C fragment L20 (FIGS. 5 through 5C) demonstrates that the form of VEGF II A subunit in the heterodimer is the 164 amino acid form.
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequence of Lyc C fragment L26 (FIGS. 6 through 6B) demonstrates that the form of VEGF II B subunit in the heterodimer is the 135 amino acid form.

      <br/>
      All subsequent chromatographic steps were performed at 20-22 (degree)  C. Protein specifically eluted from the lectin affinity column was loaded onto a 25 * 0.46 cm poly(aspartic acid) WCX HPLC column (Nest Group) pre-equilibrated in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, and eluted with a 45 min 0 to 1 M NaCl linear gradient at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min monitoring absorbance at 280 nm.

The first peak of mitogenic activity was pooled, loaded onto a 5 * 0.46 cm Vydac C4 RP-HPLC column (The Separations Group) equilibrated in 10 mM TFA and eluted with a 60 min linear gradient of 0 to 67% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min monitoring absorbance at 210 nm.
      <br/>
      Mitogenically active fractions were pooled and re-chromatographed (Smart System, LKB) using a 5 * 0.1 cm C4 microbore column with a linear 60 min gradient from 0 to 50% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 35  MU l/min to yield pure VEGF II (AB) heterodimers.

      <br/>
      Further fractionation of homodimeric VEGF BB relied on the identification of immunocrossreactive protein by Western analysis using an antisera made to a synthetic polypeptide corresponding to amino acid residues 30-50 conjugated to a tuberculin-purified protein derivative as described �Fallon, J. H., DiSalvo, J., Loughlin, S. E., Gimenez-Gallego, G., Seroogy, K. B., Bradshaw, R. A., Morrison, R. S., Ciofi, P. and Thomas, K. A. (1992) Growth Factors 6, 139-157�. A second antisera was made to a synthetic polypeptide identical in sequence to residues 1-24 of VEGF I (AA) homodimers.
      <br/>
      These two antisera were used to identify chromatographic fractions containing either one or both of the VEGF B and A subunits.
      <br/>
      Fractions from the poly(aspartic acid) column that contained VEGF B but not VEGF A immunocrossreactive bands were pooled and chromatographed by sequential fractionation on a 5 * 0.46 cm Vydac C4 RP-HPLC column followed by a 5 * 0.1 cm C4 microbore column as described for the heterodimer purification.

      Conditioned media of rat GS-9L glioma cells were fractionated on CM-Sephadex C-50 and Con A Sepharose as described for the original purification of homodimeric VEGF I (AA) �Conn, G., Soderman, D. D., Schaeffer, M.-T., Wile, M., Hatcher, V. B. and Thomas, K. A., (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 1323-1327�. Protein specifically eluted from the lectin column was resolved into two peaks of mitogenic activity, the second of which (FIG. 8 panel A, pool 2) was further fractionated to yield pure homodimeric VEGF.
      <br/>
      The protein mitogen in the first of the two activity peaks (FIG. 8 panel A, pool 1) has now also been purified to homogeneity by C4 RP-HPLC (FIG. 8 panel B and FIG. 8 panel C) yielding 150-300 ng of pure protein (denoted VEGF II) per liter of conditioned medium.
    </p>
    <p num="176">
      Compared to homodimeric VEGF I that has an apparent nonreduced mass of 43.5 kDa by this purification, the newly purified non-reduced VEGF II mitogen migrates as major 49.5 kDa and trace .about.40 kDa bands (FIG. 9 panel A, lanes 1 and 2).
      <br/>
      Small differences in mass between this and the preceding purification can be attributable to differences in carbohydrate content.
      <br/>
      On reducing SDS/PAGE pure VEGF I homodimer migrates at its subunit mass of 27 kDa whereas this novel mitogen separates into two principal bands of 27 and 31 kDa (FIG. 9 panel B, lanes 1 and 2).
      <br/>
      Immunocrossreactive VEGF A subunit was demonstrated in both nonreduced proteins (FIG. 10 panel A, lanes 1 and 2) and to correspond to the reduced 27 kDa but not the 31 kDa bands (FIG. 10 panel B, lanes 1 and 2).

      However, the first peak, designated VEGF B, was distinct by both N-terminal amino acid sequencing and sequence analysis of a family of polypeptides purified on a C18 reversed phase HPLC column from a Lys-C digest (FIGS. 6 through 6B).
      <br/>
      Therefore, this newly purified mitogen appears to be a previously unknown heterodimer composed of VEGF A and B subunits.
