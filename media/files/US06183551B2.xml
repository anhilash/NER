    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">the present invention relates to a curable resin composition comprising a saturated hydrocarbon polymer having at least one silicon-containing group which has at least one hydroxyl or hydrolyzable group bonded to a silicon atom and is crosslinkable through the formation of a siloxane bond (hereinafter referred to as a "reactive silicon-containing group").</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      It is known that saturated hydrocarbon polymers having at least one reactive silicon-containing group in a molecule have interesting properties that they are crosslinked through the formation of siloxane bonds which is associated with the hydrolysis of reactive silicon-containing groups with moisture even at room temperature, and provide rubbery cured materials.
      <br/>
      Such polymers are useful as sealing materials for construction or sealing materials for insulating glass units, since they have excellent heat resistance, water resistance, weather resistance and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The sealing materials for construction are required to have good handling properties and workability, since they are applied at construction sites using caulking guns and the like.
      <br/>
      The sealing materials for insulating glass units are discharged using applicators, that is, apparatuses for discharging sealing materials, in factories for insulating glass units.
      <br/>
      In this case, good workability with good discharging properties is required for the sealing materials.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      However, saturated hydrocarbon polymers such as polyisobutylene have high viscosity and thus low handling properties, when they are used as sealants such as the sealing materials for construction or insulating glass units.
      <br/>
      Thus, they are plasticized by the addition of hydrogenated polybutene, paraffinic oils, naphthenic oils, and the like.
      <br/>
      However, the use of such plasticizers may be associated with some problems, for example, large heating loss, insufficient plasticizing effects, low flowability at low temperature, etc.
      <br/>
      Because of the low flowability at low temperature, the sealing materials for construction, which have to be applied at the construction sites, are attended with low extrudability or workability in winter seasons.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">An object of the present invention is to provide a curable resin composition comprising a saturated hydrocarbon polymer having a reactive silicon-containing group which has improved workability, in particular, at low temperature without deteriorating physical, adhesion and curing properties and storage stability of the composition.</p>
    <p num="8">According to the first aspect, the present invention provides a curable resin composition comprising:</p>
    <p num="9">
      (A) a saturated hydrocarbon polymer having at least one reactive silicon-containing group in a molecule, and
      <br/>
      (B) a hydrogenated oligomer of an  ALPHA -olefin.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      According to the second aspect, the present invention provides a curable resin composition comprising:
      <br/>
      (A) a saturated hydrocarbon polymer having at least one reactive silicon-containing group in a molecule,
      <br/>
      (C) a saturated hydrocarbon oligomer, and
      <br/>
      (D) an ester plasticizer.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">A saturated hydrocarbon polymer contained in the curable resin composition of the present invention has, in a molecule, at least one silicon-containing group which has at least one hydroxyl or hydrolyzable group bonded to a silicon atom and is crosslinkable through the formation of a siloxane bond, that is, at least one reactive silicon-containing group.</p>
    <p num="12">
      The saturated hydrocarbon polymer means a polymer which contains substantially no carbon--carbon unsaturated bond except aromatic rings.
      <br/>
      Examples of the saturated hydrocarbon polymer are polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisobutylene, hydrogenated polybutadiene, hydrogenated polyisoprene, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="13">A preferable example of the reactive silicon-containing group is a group of the formula (1):  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="14">wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and represent a hydrogen atom, a C1-20 alkyl group, a C6-20 aryl group, a C7-20 aralkyl group or a triorganosiloxy group of the formula: (R')3 SiO-- in which three R' groups are the same or different and represent a hydrogen atom or a C1-20 alkyl group which may be substituted with, for example, a halogen atom, C6-20 aryl group, and the like; the X groups are the same or different and represent a hydroxyl group or a hydrolyzable group; a is 0, 1, 2 or 3; and b is 0, 1 or 2, provided that the sum of a and b is not 0; and m is an integer of 0 to 19.</p>
    <p num="15">The hydrolyzable group may be any conventional hydrolyzable group, and examples of such a group are a hydrogen atom, an alkoxy group, an acyloxy group, a ketoxymate group, an amino group, an amido group, an aminoxy group, a mercapto group, an alkenyloxy group, and the like.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Among them, the alkoxy, amido and aminoxy groups are preferable.
      <br/>
      In particular, the alkoxy group is preferable in view of its mild hydrolyzability and easy handling.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      One, two or three hydrolyzable groups and/or hydroxyl groups can be attached to one silicon atom, and the total number of the hydrolyzable groups and/or hydroxyl groups, that is, (a+mb) is preferably between 1 and 5.
      <br/>
      When two or more hydrolyzable or hydroxyl groups are present in the reactive silicon-containing group, they may be the same or different.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The reactive silicon-containing group contains at least one silicon atom.
      <br/>
      When the silicon atoms are bonded through siloxane bonds or the like, the number of silicon atoms is preferably 20 or less.
      <br/>
      In particular, a reactive silicon-containing group of the formula (2):  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="19">wherein R2 and X are the same as defined above and a' is 1, 2 or 3, is preferable, because of easy availability.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The saturated hydrocarbon polymer contains at least one reactive silicon-containing group, preferably 1.1 to 5 reactive silicon-containing groups in a molecule on the average.
      <br/>
      When the number of the reactive silicon-containing group in a molecule is less than one, the composition tends to have insufficient curing properties, and thus the cured material may not have good rubbery elasticity.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The reactive silicon-containing group(s) may be bonded to an end or an internal part of each polymer chain of the saturated hydrocarbon polymer, or both.
      <br/>
      The reactive silicon-containing groups are preferably bonded to the ends of polymer chains, since they can maximize the chain length between cross-linking sites in the final cured material.
      <br/>
      Thus, a rubbery cured material having high strength and large elongation is easily obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The saturated hydrocarbon polymers may be used independently or in admixture of two or more of them.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The polymer which constitutes the backbone of the saturated hydrocarbon polymer having the reactive silicon-containing group may be prepared by any conventional polymerization method.
      <br/>
      For example, such a polymer can be prepared by (1) polymerizing a C1-6 olefin such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, isobutylene, etc. as a main monomer, or (2) polymerizing a diene compound such as butadiene, isoprene, etc. or copolymerizing such a diene compound with the above olefin, and then hydrogenating the polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Among the polymers, isobutylene polymers and hydrogenated polybutadiene polymers are preferred, since functional groups are easily introduced at the polymer chain ends, their molecular weights can be easily controlled and the number of the functional groups to be introduced is increased.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Isobutylene polymers may consist of isobutylene repeating units.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the isobutylene polymers may contain 50 wt. % or less, preferably 30 wt % or less, more preferably 10 wt. % or less of comonomeric repeating units.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Examples of the comonomer which may be copolymerized with isobutylene are C4-12 olefins, vinyl ethers, aromatic vinyl compounds, vinylsilanes, allylsilanes, and the like.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of the comonomers are 1-butene, 2-butene, 2-methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, hexane, vinylcyclohexene, methyl vinyl ether, ethyl vinyl ether, isobutyl vinyl ether, styrene,  ALPHA -methylstyrene, dimethylstyrene, monochlorostyrene, dichlorostyrene,  BETA -pinene, indene, vinyltrichlorosilane, vinylmethyldichlorosilane, vinyldimethylchlorosilane, vinyldimethylmethoxysilane, vinyltrimethylsilane, divinyldichlorosilane, divinyldimethoxysilane, divinyldimethylsilane, 1,3-divinyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane, trivinylmethylsilane, tetravinylsilane, allyltrichlorosilane, allylmethyldichlorosilane, allyldimethylchlorosilane, allyldimethylmethoxysilane, allyltrimethylsilane, diallyldichlorosilane, diallyldimethoxysilane, diallyldimethylsilane,  DELTA -methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane,  DELTA -methacryloyloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      When vinylsilanes or allylsilanes are used as comonomers to be copolymerized with isobutylene, the content of silicon atoms in the copolymer increases and thus the number of groups which act as silane-coupling sites increases.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the adhesion properties of the resulting composition improve.
    </p>
    <p num="28">The hydrogenated polybutadiene or other saturated hydrocarbon polymers may comprise other repeating units in addition to the main repeating units as in the case of the above isobutylene polymers.</p>
    <p num="29">the saturated hydrocarbon polymer having the reactive silicon-containing groups may comprise a small amount, preferably 10 wt % or less, more preferably 5% or less, in particular 1 wt. % or less, of repeating units having a double bond after polymerization, which are derived from polyene compounds, for instance, butadiene, isoprene and the like.</p>
    <p num="30">The number average molecular weight of the saturated hydrocarbon polymer, preferably isobutylene or hydrogenated polybutadiene polymers is preferably between 500 and 50,000, more preferably between 1000 and 20,000, in which range the polymers are in a liquid state or have flowability and thus their handling is easy.</p>
    <p num="31">Now, the preparation of the saturated hydrocarbon polymer having the reactive silicon-containing groups will be explained.</p>
    <p num="32">
      Among the isobutylene polymers having the reactive silicon-containing groups, isobutylene polymers having the reactive silicon-containing groups at the chain ends can be prepared using isobutylene polymers having functional groups at chain ends, preferably at all the chain ends, which has been prepared by cationic polymerization using special compounds which are so-called inifers and function as initiators and chain transfer agents (inifer method).
      <br/>
      For example, polyisobutylene having unsaturated groups at chain ends is prepared by dehydrohalogenation of such a polymer or the introduction of unsaturated groups to such a polymer as described in JP-A-63-105005 (=U.S. Pat. No. 4,758,631).
      <br/>
      Then, a hydrosilane compound of the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="33">wherein R1, R2, X, a and b are the same as defined above, preferably, a hydrosilane compound of the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="34">wherein R2, X and a' are the same as defined above is added to polyisobutylene having the unsaturated groups at the chain ends in the presence of platinum catalysts by a so-called hydrosilylation reaction, and thus the reactive silicon-containing groups are introduced into the polymer.</p>
    <p num="35">Such methods are described in JP-B-4-69659 (=EP-A-0 252 372), JP-B-7-108928 (=EP-A-0 252 372), JP-A-63-254149 (=EP-A-0 287 025), JP-A-64-22904 and Japanese Patent No. 2539445.</p>
    <p num="36">
      Examples of the hydrosilane compounds used in the above methods are halogenated silanes (e.g. trichlorosilane, methyldichlorosilane, dimethylchlorosilane, phenyldichlorosilane, etc.); alkoxysilanes (e.g. trimethoxysilane, triethoxysilane, methyldiethoxysilane, methyldimethoxysilane, phenyldimethoxysilane, etc.); acyloxysilanes (e.g. methyldiacetoxysilane, phenyldiacetoxysilane, etc.); ketoximatesilanes (e.g. bis(dimethylketoximate)-methylsilane, bis(cyclohexylketoximate)methylsilane, etc.); and the like.
      <br/>
      Among them, halogenated silanes and alkoxysilanes are preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Isobutylene polymers having the reactive silicon-containing groups in the internal parts of the polymer chains can be prepared by copolymerizing vinylsilans or allylsilanes having at least one reactive silicon-containing group with a monomer comprising isobutylene.</p>
    <p num="38">Furthermore, isobutylene polymers having the reactive silicon-containing groups at the chain ends and also in the internal parts of the polymer chains can be prepared by polymerizing isobutylene in the presence of vinylsilanes or allylsilanes having at least one reactive silicon-containing group and then introducing the reactive silicon-containing groups at the chain ends in the same method as described above.</p>
    <p num="39">Examples of the vinylsilane or allylsilanes having the reactive silicon-containing group are vinyltrichlorosilane, vinylmethyldichlorosilane, vinyldimethylchlorosilane, vinyldimethylmethoxysilane, divinyldichlorosilane, divinyldimethoxysilane, allytrichlorosilane, allylmethyldichlorosilane, allyldimethylchlorosilane, allyldimethylmethoxysilane, diallyldichlorosilane, diallyldimethoxysilane,  DELTA -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane,  DELTA -methacryloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane,  DELTA -methacryloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane, and the like.</p>
    <p num="40">
      The hydrogenated polybutadiene polymers may be prepared by converting the hydroxyl groups of hydrogenated polymers having terminal hydroxy groups to oxymetal groups such as --ONa or --OK, and then reacting the polymers with an organic halocompound of the formula:
      <br/>
      CH2.dbd.CH--R3 --Y  (3)
    </p>
    <p num="41">wherein Y is a halogen atom such as a chlorine or iodine atom, and R3 is a divalent organic group of the formula: --R4 --, --R4 --OCO-- or --R4 -- CO-- in which R4 is a divalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon, preferably, an alkylene, cycloalkylene, arylene or aralkylene group, in particular, --CH2 --, --R"--C6 H5 --CH2 -- in which R" is a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and hydrogenated polybutadiene polymers having olefinic groups at the chain ends (which may be referred to as "olefin-terminated hydrogenated polybutadiene polymers") are obtained.</p>
    <p num="42">The terminal hydroxyl groups of the hydrogenated polybutadiene polymers having the hydroxyl groups at the chain ends may be converted to the oxymetal groups by reacting such polymers with alkali metals (e.g. sodium, potassium, etc.), metal hydrides (e.g. sodium hydride, etc), metal alkoxides (e.g. sodium methoxide, etc.), alkali metal hydroxides (e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc.), and the like.</p>
    <p num="43">
      The above methods provide the olefin-terminated hydrogenated polybutadiene polymers having substantially the same molecular weight as that of the hydroxy-terminated hydrogenated polybutadiene polymers used as the starting polymers.
      <br/>
      To obtain polybutadiene polymers having higher molecular weights, prior to the reaction with the organic halocompound (3), the hydroxy-terminated hydrogenated polybutadiene polymers are reacted with polyvalent organic halocompounds having at least 2 halogen atoms in a molecule, and then with the organic halocompound (3).
      <br/>
      Thereby, the olefin-terminated hydrogenated polybutadiene polymers having the higher molecular weight are obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Specific examples of the organic halocompound (3) are allyl chloride, allyl bromide, vinyl(chloromethyl)benzene, allyl(chloromethyl)benzene, allyl(bromomethyl)benzene, allyl chloromethyl ether, allyl(chloromethoxy)benzene, 1-butenyl chloromethyl ether, 1-hexenyl(chloromethoxy)benzene, allyloxy(chloromethyl)benzene, and the like.
      <br/>
      Among them, allyl chloride is preferable since it is inexpensive and easily reacts with the polymers.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The reactive silicon-containing groups can be introduced in the olefin-terminated hydrogenated polybutadiene polymers by adding hydrosilane compounds to the polymers in the presence of platinum catalysts like in the case of the preparation of the isobutylene polymers having the reactive silicon-containing groups at the chain ends.</p>
    <p num="46">
      When the unsaturated hydrocarbon polymers having the reactive silicon-containing groups include substantially no unsaturated bonds except aromatic rings in the molecules, the resin compositions comprising such polymers have much better weather resistance than the sealants comprising rubbery polymers such as organic polymers having unsaturated bonds or oxyalkylene polymers.
      <br/>
      Since such polymers are hydrocarbon polymers, they have good moisture barrier properties and water resistance as well as good adhesion properties onto various inorganic substrates such as glass, aluminum, etc., and provide cured materials having high moisture barrier properties.
    </p>
    <p num="47">The amount of the saturated hydrocarbon polymers having the reactive silicon-containing groups in the curable resin composition of the present invention is preferably at least 10 wt %, more preferably at least 20 wt. %, in particular at least 30 wt %.</p>
    <p num="48">The curable resin composition according to the first aspect of the present invention contains a hydrogenated oligomer of an  ALPHA -olefin (B) for improving extrudability and workability of the curable resin composition at low temperature.</p>
    <p num="49">
      the hydrogenated oligomers of the  ALPHA -olefins are obtained by hydrogenating polymers which have been prepared from  ALPHA -olefins having at least 4 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Such oligomers are distinguished by that they have more bulky side chains than oligomers of lower olefins such as ethylene or propylene, or natural mineral or animal oils, and have very unique physical properties.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Because of the bulky side chains, the above hydrogenated oligomers have low pour (flow) points and very low viscosities at low temperature.
      <br/>
      Thus, the hydrogenated oligomers may improve the extrudability and workability of the curable compositions at low temperature.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the hydrogenated oligomers have good compatibility with the saturated hydrocarbon polymers (A), since they are nonpolar hydrocarbon oils comprising carbon and hydrogen atoms.
      <br/>
      Thus, they may not have adverse effects on adhesion properties, coating properties, stain resistance, and the like of the curable resin composition of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Kinds of monomers constituting the hydrogenated oligomers are not limited.
      <br/>
      Preferable examples of such monomers are linear  ALPHA -olefins having 4 to 18 carbon atoms (e.g. 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, 1-undecene, 1-dodecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-hexadecene, 1-octadecene, etc.), branched  ALPHA -olefins having 4 to 18 carbon atoms (e.g. 4-methyl-1-pentene, etc.), and the like.
      <br/>
      Among them, linear  ALPHA -olefins having 8 to 18 carbon atoms such as 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene, and the like are preferable, since they provide oligomers having good flowability.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The number average molecular weight of the hydrogenated oligomer is not limited, but is preferably between 200 and 700, in particular between 250 and 500.
      <br/>

      The composition of Comparative Example 1 had good workability in summer, since it contained SEELETS 200 as a filler, which has good thixotropic properties and stream-breaking properties.
      <br/>
      However, DIANA PROCESS used as the plasticizer contains waxy components.
      <br/>
      Thus, the composition had low flowability at low temperature and its extrudability at 5 (degree)  C. was larger than 5 seconds.
      <br/>
      That is, its workability in winter is not good.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      The compositions of Examples 1-4 contained the hydrogenated oligomers of  ALPHA -olefins (B) as plasticizers according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      PAO 5002 and PAO 5004, which are the hydrogenated oligomers of  ALPHA -olefins (B) and used in Examples 1 to 4, are synthetic oils comprising hydrogenated oligomers of 1-decene having oligomerization degrees of 1 to 5.
      <br/>
      PAO 5002 and PAO 5004 have high plasticizing effects and good flowability at low temperature, since they have narrow molecular weight distribution of less than 1.1 (Mw/Mn), and structures having relatively short backbones and bulky side chains.
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      Accordingly, the compositions of Examples 1 to 4 containing PAO 5002 or PAO 5004 had better extrudability at 5 (degree)  C. than that of Comparative Example 1, that is, better workability at low temperature.
      <br/>
      In particular, the composition of Example 4 in which all PS-32 was replaced with PAO 5002 had the extrudability at 5 (degree)  C. of 2.2 seconds, and good workability in winter.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      It is understood from the results of the viscosity measurement using a BS type viscometer that the use of PAO 5002 of PAO 5004 in place of PS-32 improves the workability of the curable resin compositions.
      <br/>
      That is, all the compositions of Examples 1-4 had lower viscosities than that of Comparative Example 1.
    </p>
    <p num="123">It is understood from the results of the H type tensile adhesion test that the use of the hydrogenated oligomers of the  ALPHA -olefins does not have any adverse effects on the mechanical properties of the cured materials and the adhesion properties of the compositions.</p>
    <p num="124">Comparison of Examples 1 and 2 indicates that the difference of the moisture sources, that is, water and Na2 SO4.10H2 O, has little influence on the workability at low temperature.</p>
    <p num="125">The composition of Example 5 contained the saturated hydrocarbon oligomer (C), that is, DIANA PROCESS PS-32, and the ester plasticizer (D), that is, SANSOCIZER DOA, in combination.</p>
    <p num="126">Comparison of Example 5 and Comparative Example 1 shows that the addition of the ester plasticizer can greatly improve the viscosity and extrudability at 5 (degree)  C. It is understood from the results of the H type tensile adhesion test that the composition of Example 5 had good adhesion properties.</p>
    <p num="127">
      Furthermore, the elongation at break (maximum load) was 420% in Comparative Example 1 in which the saturated hydrocarbon oligomer was used alone, but it increased to 590% by the co-use of the ester plasticizer in Example 5.
      <br/>
      Such high elongation properties are preferable for the elastic sealing materials.

      It is understood from the results of the viscosities measured with the BS type viscometer that the use of PAO 5002, which is a hydrogenated oligomer of an  ALPHA -olefin, in place of PS-32 greatly decreased the viscosity of the composition.
      <br/>
      That is, the compositions of Examples 6 and 7 had the lower viscosity and better dischargeability from an applicator than that of Comparative Example 2.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the thixotropic properties which are expressed by a ratio of a viscosity at 1 rpm or 2 rpm to that at 10 rpm (1/10 viscosity ratio or 2/10 viscosity ratio) was higher in Examples 6 and 7 than in Comparative Example 2.
      <br/>
      This means that the compositions of Examples 6 and 7 had also better sagging and stream-breaking properties than that of Comparative Example 2.

    <p num="137">The results of the H type tensile adhesion test indicate that the use of the hydrogenated oligomer of the  ALPHA -olefin as the plasticizer does not have any adverse effects on the mechanical properties of the cured materials, and the adhesion properties of the curable resin compositions.</p>
    <p num="138">
      The composition of Comparative Example 3 contained only the ester plasticizer (D) as the plasticizer.
      <br/>
      When only an ester plasticizer is used as a plasticizer, a curable resin composition has low adhesion properties due to bleeding out and thus it shows 100% adhesive (interface) failure as shown in Table 2, since the ester plasticizer has low compatibility with the saturated hydrocarbon polymer (A).
    </p>
    <p num="139">However, when the ester plasticizers are used in combination with the saturated hydrocarbon oligomers as in Examples 8, 9 and 10, the compositions have low viscosities, and most of them show the cohesive failure.</p>
