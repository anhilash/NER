      This is a Division, of application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/274,686 filed on Jul. 14, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,085.
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to the use of esters of alkanoyl L-carnitines for producing pharmaceutical compositions suitable for treating endotoxic shock.</p>
    <p num="3">Since, as it will be described in detail hereinbelow, some of these esters are novel compounds, the present invention also relates to these novel esters.</p>
    <p num="4">The esters suitable for the use according to the invention have the formula (I)  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="5">wherein:</p>
    <p num="6">
      R is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkanoyl, having 2-26 carbon atoms, optionally  OMEGA -substituted with a R2 group selected from trialkylammonium or dialkylsulfonium wherein the alkyl group has 1-3 carbon atoms: hydroxyl; carboxyl; halogen; methanesulfonyl and hydroxysulfonyl;
      <br/>
      R1 is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkyl having 2-26 carbon atoms, optionally  OMEGA -substituted with R2, wherein R2 has the previously defined meaning, and
      <br/>
      X- is the anion of a pharmacologically acceptable acid.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Esters of alkanoyl L-carnitines are already known. U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,438 discloses compounds having the foregoing formula (I) wherein R is a straight or branched alkanoyl having 2-4 carbon atoms optionally substituted with halogen atoms or hydroxyl, or pantothenyl or linoleyl; R1 is an optionally substituted straight or branched alkyl having 1-5 carbon atoms.</p>
    <p num="8">These compounds are used for the therapeutical treatment of myocardial hypocontractility and as antidepressants.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Esters of alkanoyl L-carnitines having the formula (I) wherein R is a straight of branched alkanoyl having 2-16 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      R1 is a straight alkyl having 11-16 carbon atoms and X- is the anion of a pharmacologically acceptable acid �typically, isovaleryl L-carnitine undecyl ester chloride (ST 722)� were disclosed in EP 0552137 A2 and EP 0552138 A2 both published after the priority date of the present application.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The pharmacological activities reported for these esters comprise the antibacterial activity (particularly against bacterial belonging to the genera Campylobacter and Helicobacter) and the antimycotic activity, particularly against yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans) and filamentous fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus), respectively.</p>
    <p num="11">Also EP 0559625, published after the priority date of the present application, discloses esters having the formula (I) wherein R is hydrogen or a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkanoyl having 2-26 carbon atoms and R1 is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkyl radical having 4-26 carbon atoms, which are endowed with myorelaxant activity selectively directed towards the gastro-intestinal tract.</p>
    <p num="12">The pharmacological properties and therapeutical utilizations described for all the aforesaid known alkanoyl L-carnitine esters are totally remote from and unrelated to the activity (protective action against endotoxic shock) of the compounds of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="13">
      Finally, in order to complete the prior art background relevant to the present invention, reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 4,771,075 which disloses the use of acetyl L-carnitine (i.e. an alkanoyl carnitine not an ester thereof) for treating various shock conditions, comprising septic shock.
      <br/>
      In addition to the structural dissimilarity between acetyl carnitine and the aforesaid alkanoyl carnitine esters, a marked superiority of the esters having formula (I) over acetyl carnitine for treating the endotoxic shock has been shown.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      It is, therefore, apparent that the compounds having the formula (I) which are not encompassed by the aforesaid prior art references are novel compounds.
      <br/>
      More specifically, are novel those esters having the formula (I) wherein:
      <br/>
      (a) R is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkanoyl having 2-26 carbon atoms,  OMEGA -substituted with a R2 group, selected from trialkylammonium or dialkylsulfonium wherein the alkyl group has 1-3 carbon atoms, hydroxyl, carboxyl, halogen, methanesulfonyl and hydroxysulfonyl and
      <br/>
      (b) R1 is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkyl having 4-26 carbon atoms,  OMEGA -substituted with a R2 group
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      or
      <br/>
      (b') R1 is an alkyl group having 2-3 carbon atoms, provided that R has more than 4 carbon atoms and is not linoleyl or pantothenyl;
      <br/>
      (c) R is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkanoyl having 2-26 carbon atoms, and
      <br/>
      R1 is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkyl having 2-26 carbon atoms  OMEGA - substituted with a R2 group provided that:
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      - when R1 is a straight alkyl having 2 carbon atoms,  OMEGA -substituted with a R2 group
      <br/>
      - R is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkanoyl having 5-17 or 19-26 carbon atoms;
      <br/>
      (d) R is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkanoyl having 2-26 carbon atoms,  OMEGA -substituted with a R2 group, and
      <br/>
      - R1 is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkyl having 2-26 carbon atoms provided that:
    </p>
    <p num="17">-  when R1 is a straight or branched alkkyl having 2-4 carbon atoms and R is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkanoyl having 2-4 carbon atoms, R2 as substituent of R is not halogen.</p>
    <p num="18">Endotoxic shock is a clinical syndrome associated with a high mortality rate and characterized by various haemodynamic, immunological and biochemical abnomarlities.</p>
    <p num="19">
      Its increasing incidence places it among the most serious nosocomial pathologies, especially in intensive care units, despite the use of a variety of antibiotics, surgical drainage, intervention with vasoactive substances and metabolic support.
      <br/>
      It is estimated that approximately 100,000 people die of endotoxic shock every year in the USA.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The main cause of this type of pathology is undoudtedly severe infection with Gram-negative bacteria, whose physio-pathological effects are ascribable to LPS, a component of the outer layer of the bacterial membrane capable of causing endotoxic shock by interacting with various components of the host's immune system, particularly macrophages.</p>
    <p num="21">This immunocompetent cell population, in fact, releases different endogenous mediators which prove ultimately responsible for the complex pathological picture which ensues.</p>
    <p num="22">The fatal outcome of endotoxic shock in man has recently been linked to the systemic release of substantial amounts of various cytokines.</p>
    <p num="23">There are, in fact, numerous studies which show that an abnormal modulation of cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF and IFN- GAMMA  is closely related to a severe endotoxic situation.</p>
    <p num="24">Other inflammation mediators (PAF, LTD, BK, substance P) would also appear to be involved in the endotoxic physio-pathology.</p>
    <p num="25">
      TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) is in any event the cytokine which plays a crucial role as mediator in the host's response to LPS (Tracery K J, Tumor Necrosis Factor (Cachectin) in the Biology of Endotoxic Shock Syndrome. +i Circ. Shock 1991; 35:123-28), since its involvement has been demonstated in various metabolic abnormalities characterizing the course of shock (Starnes H K, Warren R S, Jeevandam M. et al. Tumor Necrosis Factor and the acute metabolic response to tissue injury in man. J. Clin. Invest. 1988: 82:1321), the negative prognosis of which is often related to excessively high serum concentrations of TNF (Dames P, Reuter A, Gysen P, Demonty J, Lamy M, Franchimont P. Tumor Necrosis Factor and interleukin-1 serum levels during severe sepsis in humans.

      Crit Care Med. 1989; 17:489-494).
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In fact, high levels of TNF are found in the serum of animals experimentally intoxicated with LPS, and animals directly inoculated with TNF develop a toxic syndrome which is indistinguishable from endotoxinaemia (Natanson C, Eichenhols P W, Danner R L. Endotoxin and Tumor Necrosis Factor challenges in dogs simulate the cardiovascular profile of human endotoxic shock. J. Exp, Med. 1989; 169: 823-832.

    </p>
    <p num="27">Consequently, compounds which block or antogonize TNF may be regarded as useful therapeutical candidates in the treatment of endotoxic shock.</p>
    <p num="28">It was found that the esters having the formula (I) are endowed with such pharmacological properties.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Preferred are the esters having the formula (I) wherein R, R1, R2 and X- comply with the following conditions:
      <br/>
      When R is a saturated, straight alkanoyl, it is preferably selected from heptanoyl, octanoyl, palmitoyl and undecanoyl;
      <br/>
      when R is branched it is preferably selected from isobutyryl, isovaleryl, isocaproyl and 2-methylhexanoyl;
      <br/>
      when R is unsaturated it is preferably 10-undecenoyl.
      <br/>
      - R2 is preferably selected from trimethylammonium, bromine and hydroxyl.
      <br/>
      when R1 is a saturated, straight group, it is preferably selected from ethyl, n-pentyl, n-heptyl, n-decyl, n-undecyl;
      <br/>
      when to R1 is branched, it is preferably selected from isobutyl, isooctyl, hexylmethylcarbyl, ethylpentylcarbyl, ethylhexylcarbyl, decylme-thylcarbyl, dipentylcarbyl and methylnonilcarbyl;
      <br/>
      when R1 is unsaturated it is preferably pentylvinylcarbyl or 10-undecenyl.
    </p>
    <p num="30">X- is preferably selected from: chloride; bromide; iodide; aspartate, particularly acid aspartate; citrate, particularly acid citrate; tartrate; phosphate, particularly acid phosphate; fumarate, particularly acid fumarate; glicerophosphate; glucosephosphate; lactate; maleate, particularly acid maleate; orotate; oxalate, particularly acid oxalate; sulphate, particularly acid sulphate; trichloroacetate; trifluoroacetate and methanesulfonate.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The esters having the formula (I) can be prepared by following two distinct synthesis routes.
      <br/>
      The first process (shown in the synthesis scheme 1) comprises the steps of:
      <br/>
      (a) halogenating an alkanoylcarnitine with a halogenating agent such as thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride (molar ratio 1:1 to 1:4) in an inert, anhydrous organic solvent such as acetonitrile or methylene chloride, at 0-30 (degree)  C., for 1-4 hours, concentrating and utilzing the raw reaction product in the following step;
      <br/>
      (b) dissolving the acid chloride of step (a) in an inert anhydrous, organic solvent such as acetonitrile or methylene chloride and adding the alcohol R1 OH optionally diluted in the same solvent, molar ratio 1:0.5-1:2 at 0-50 (degree)  C., for 2-24 hours, concentrating the resultant solution and optionally purifying the compounds by silica gel chromatography;
      <br/>
      (c) eluting the product of step (b) dissolved in water or an organic solvent on a strongly basic ionic exchange resin, such as AMBERLITE IRA 402, or a weakly basic resin, such as AMBERLIST A 21, activated with the appropriated acid HX, and isolating the end product via lyophilization or concentration.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      A further process (shown in the synthesis scheme 2) comprises the steps of:
      <br/>
      (a') reacting carnitine or an alkanoylcarnitine inner salt with the appropriate alkyl halogenide (preferably, bromide or iodide) in an inert anhydrous organic solvent, at 3-60 (degree)  C., for 8-24 hours and isolating the compound via concentration;
      <br/>
      (b') when the starting product of step (a') is carnitine, acylating the carnitine ester obtained in step (a') with the appropriate acid chloride via known procedures;
      <br/>
      (c') eluting an aqueous or alcoholic solution of the compound of step (a') or (b') on a ionic exchange resin such as AMBERLITE IRA 402 or AMBERLIST A 21 activated with the appropriate acid HX.

    <p num="120">
      Experimental endotoxic shock, induced in laboratory animals by LPS injection, is thought to be a convenient model in mimicking the typical physiological and immunological dysregulations occurring in clinical practice during septic shock induced by Gram negative bacteria.
      <br/>
      This experimental shock model, therefore, is useful in studying the putative efficacy of new therapeutic agents, and gives valuable information regarding their possible use in human therapy (Dunn D L. Role of endotoxin and host cytokines in septic shock.

    </p>
    <p num="121">In the present study acetyl-L-carnitine chloride (referred to as ST 200) has been used as a reference compound in that its activity in endotoxic shock is very well known.</p>
    <p num="122">As newly-invention compounds, the following substances have been used:</p>
    <p num="123">isovaleryl-L-carnitine chloride undecyl ester (ST 722); palmitoyl-L-carnitine chloride 2-trimethylammonium-ethyl ester chloride (ST 1058); isovaleryl-L-carnitine chloride dodecyl ester (ST 1037); octanoyl-L-carnitine chloride undecyl ester (ST 1000).</p>
    <p num="124">After a comparative evaluation of the protective effect of ST 200 and the newly-synthesized alcanoyl L-carnitine esters in an experimental endotoxin shock model, the results obtained show that such esters possess a therapeutic efficacy--in terms of both increased survival and prolongation of the Mean Survival Time (MST) as well as health state--which is greater than that one of the reference compound.</p>
    <p num="125">EXPERIMENTAL MODEL OF ENDOTOXIC SHOCK: EVALUATION OF THE EFFECT OF ST 200 ON SERUM TNF LEVELS AND LETHALITY INDUCED BY LPS IN MICE.</p>
    <p num="126">Male C57BL/6 inbred mice (Iffa Credo) aged 6-7 weeks have been utilized (8-16 animals per experimental group).</p>
    <p num="127">The compound ST 200, solubilized in sterile saline, was administered to mice intraperitoneally (i.p) in a volume of 0.1 ml per 10 gr of body weight (b.w.).</p>
    <p num="128">In the experiments regarding serum TNF determinations, the compound was administered at the dose of 50 mg/kg at 60 min (by i.p. route) and 10 min (by intravenous route) before and after LPS injection, respectively.</p>
    <p num="129">To evaluate the protective effect of the compound on the LPS-induced lethality, a first experiment was performed following the same treatment protocol as the one described above for TNF.</p>
    <p num="130">
      Moreover a second experiment was performed following a treatment protocol based on two daily i.p. administrations of the compound from day -1 through day +3 (once only on day 0) with respect to LPS injection (day 0).
      <br/>
      The endotoxin shock model in C57BL/6 mice was based on the i.p. administration of 30 mg/kg LPS (E. coli O55:B5, Difco).
      <br/>
      The LPS, when dissolved in sterile saline and injected (0.1 ml/ 10 gr b.w.) at the above-reported dose, was able to provoke the death of 60-80% of treated animals, depending on the batch.
      <br/>
      CO2 -anesthetized mice were bled by retro-orbital sinus puncture, and blood samples were taken 1 h following LPS injection, i.e. when TNF reached its peak levels (FIG. 1).
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      Blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for 2 h to separate serum, which was then centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 rpm.
      <br/>
      Samples were first aliquitted and then stored at -80 (degree)  C. until assayed.
    </p>
    <p num="132">Bio-assay for TNF</p>
    <p num="133">
      Concentrations of TNF in serum were determined by using the L929 cell line (a murine fibrosarcoma), which is very sensitive to the TNF cytotoxic activity (Flick A D, and Gifford G E. Comparison of In Vitro Cell Cytotoxic Assays for Tumor Necrosis Factor.
      <br/>
      J Immunol Met 1984; 68:167-175).
      <br/>
      In detail, 100  MU l of L929 cells (3.2 * 105 cells/ml) in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FCS were seeded into each well of a flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate (Falcon, Becton &amp; Dickinson, Meylan Cedex, France).
      <br/>
      After incubating for 18-24 h at 37 (degree)  C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, spent medium was discarded and two-fold serial dilutions (carried out in RPMI-1640 1% FCS) of serum samples (0.1 ml/well) were added in triplicate to the cells.
      <br/>
      Volumes of 0.1 ml of a 2  MU g/ml solution of Actinomycin D were then added to each well.
      <br/>
      Actinomycin D inhibits RNA biosynthesis and, in so doing, amplifies the L929 sensitivity to the TNF cytotoxic activity.
      <br/>
      The mircrotiter plates were then further incubated for 18 h at 37 (degree)  C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.
      <br/>
      After this incubation, the medium was discarded and the cell monolayers were washed three times with 0.9% NaCl and subsequently stained for 15 min at room temperature (RT) with 0.25% (w/v) Crystal Violet in 20% ethanol and 8% formaldehyde.
      <br/>
      After discarding the stain, the wells were gently washed in running tap water and allowed to dry at RT; the dye which had been taken up by the adering cells was eluted with 33% acetic acid and the relative absorbance at 570 nm was measured with a Multiskan MCC/340 ELISA reader (Flow Laboratories, Mclean, Va., USA).
      <br/>
      The absorbance values were then utilized to determine the TNF activity (expressed in Units/ml) of the serum samples by directly comparing the regression curve generated by the serial dilutions of each sample with the regression curve generated by the serial dilutions of a murine recombinant TNF standard having a known activity.
    </p>
    <p num="134">Evaluation of survival and health state.</p>
    <p num="135">For each experimental group, besides the evaluation of percent survival with respect to the total number of treated animals, the animal health state was monitored by evaluating some behavioral and physiological responses throughout the duration of the experiment (10 days ).</p>
    <p num="136">
      The statistical significance of the TNF results was evaluated by Student "t"-test.
      <br/>
      Survival data were analyzed by Fisher exact test, while changes in MST were evaluated by Mann-Whitney "U" test.

    <heading>RESULTS</heading>
    <p num="149">Effect of ST 722 on serum TNF release induced by LPS</p>
    <p num="150">Treatment with 10 mg/kg ST 722 was able to significantly inhibit TNF secretion in two consecutive experiments (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.01, respectively), decreasing approximately 80% of TNF release induced by LPS (Exp. 1 and Exp. 2 in Table 3).</p>
    <p num="151">
      A successive experiment showed that a serum TNF reduction to the same extend as above was also achieved when lower ST 722 doses were utilized.
      <br/>
      Actually, a significant (p&lt;0.001) decrease of circulating TNF was observed at the doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg ST 722, corresponding to 80 and 85%, respectively, of LPS control (Exp. 3 in Table 3).
    </p>
    <p num="152">A final experiment showed that a significant (p&lt;0.001) reduction of TNF release was also obtained when ST 722 was administered concurrently with LPS, although only at the dose of 5 mg/kg and not at the dose of 1.25 mg/kg (Exp. 4 Table 3).</p>
    <p num="153">In conclusion, these results are undoubtedly better than those obtained with the substance ST 200, which besides was administered at markedly higher doses.</p>
    <p num="154">Effect of ST 722 on LPS-induced lethality</p>
    <p num="155">
      The overall results obtained with 3 different treatment protocols are reported in Table 4.
      <br/>
      In particular, the results of the first experiment aimed at examining the effects of repeated ST 722 treatments on LPS-induced lethality are shown in detail in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In this case, ST 722 treatments with 2.5 and 5 mg/kg were performed first on day 0, 60 min before the challenge with 30 mg/kg LPS, and then on days +1 and +2.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      It can be noticed that ST 722, when administered following the above schedule, does not protect from LPS-induced lethality.
      <br/>
      However, if ST 722 treatment, at the dose of 2.5 mg/kg, is prolonged to day +3, an increase in the survival of treated animals is observed, although not statistically significant (FIG. 3).
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      In the last experiment (FIG. 4), carried out following a protocol based on a single daily ST 722 administration from day 0 (60 min before LPS challenge) through day +4, the survival of the animals treated with 5 mg/kg ST 722 was significantly increased (p&lt;0.02).
      <br/>
      Some protection, though not statistically significant, was also observed at the lower ST 722 doses, i.e. 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg. It is worthy of note that these repeated treatments have beneficial effects on the health state of the animals.
      <br/>
      In fact, the daily food consumption per day of survival in the group of animals injected with LPS and then treated with ST 722 is higher compared to the one of animals injected with LPS and then treated with saline (Table 5).
    </p>
    <p num="158">To summarize, the percent survival as well as the health state of the animals treated with ST 722 are significantly improved with respect to the animals treated with ST 200.</p>

      The animals (classified according to convenient identification marks) were regularly checked one by one for the duration of the experiment (10 days), and overall survival as well as health conditions were monitored.
      <br/>
      In addition to the percent survival, the Mean Survival Time (MST) was calculated at the end of the experiment.
      <br/>
      The evaluation of the health state of the animals was quantitatively assessed by determining the amount of food consumed and by measuring the rectal temperature.
      <br/>
      The former parameter was evaluated by calculating the mean food consumption both by the animals within each experimental group and by each animal per day of survival.
      <br/>
      The latter parameter was evaluated by using an arbitrary evaluation scale (score scale), which allowed to express the results as mean percent temperature variation of each group of substance- and LPS-treated animals with respect to saline-treated animals (Control group).
      <br/>
      To correctly understand the correlation between health state and registered temperature, one has to bear in mind that in this experimental model a marked hypothermia in LPS-injected animals was observed (FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      At the end of this study (see Appendix -1), strong experimental evidence is given indicating that the animal rectal temperature is a very reliable and objective criterion to evaluate the health state of the animals.

    <heading>RESULTS</heading>
    <p num="172">
      The substance ST 722 turned out to exert a protective effect, although not statistically significant, on the animals challenged with LPS: 43% of survival vs. 15% and MST of 6 vs. 2 days (Tab. 6, FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      The health state of the treated animals resulted to be better, as far the rectal temperature is concerned, than LPS-injected animals (FIG. 7).
    </p>
    <p num="173">
      Administration of ST 1058 causes a modest increase of survival (37.5% vs. 25%) but a consistent prolongation of the mean survival time (6.5 vs. 2.0 days) (Tab. 7, FIG. 8) paralleled by ameliorated physiological conditions (increased temperature) (FIG. 9).
      <br/>
      On the whole, the results obtained with ST 722 and ST 1058 in these experiments appear to be better than those obtained with ST 200.

    <p num="183">VALIDATION OF AN OBJECTIVE EVALUATION METHOD TO MONITOR THE HEALTH STATE OF ANIMALS INJECTED WITH LPS.</p>
    <p num="184">
      This study was undertaken to investigate whether there was any possibility to correlate the alteration of several behavioral parameters in LPS-injected mice with their rectal temperature.
      <br/>
      This aimed at switching from the series of experimental observations, stemming from several symptoms more or less severe provoked by the endotoxic shock and often susceptible of subjective interpretations, to a single, reliable, and objective experimental measurement: the rectal temperature.
      <br/>
      This would allow to objectively evaluate the effect exerted by a substance on the health state of animals undergoing endotoxic shock, and to avoid making a number of experimental observations in trying to adequately describe the severity of symptoms.
    </p>
    <p num="185">To this end, 90 male inbred C57BL/6 mice aged 6 weeks, utilized in 4 different experiments of LPS-induced shock, were closely followed up to 10 days after the endotoxin injection.</p>
    <p num="186">Six different degrees of disease were defined, and each animal was ranked according to an arbitrary evaluation scale that took into account the severity of a series of behavioral parameters, such as reduction of spontaneous activity, hyporeactivity to stimuli, anorexia, piloerection, circling, ptosis, ocular exudate etc. . . . Animal rectal temperature measurements were taken with an electronic thermometer (Termist TMS) with the appropriate thermistor.</p>
    <p num="187">From FIG. 10, in which the correlation between degree of disease of each animal and its temperature is shown, it can be easily noticed the existence of a correlation having a very high statistical significance.</p>
    <p num="188">Therefore, we believe that temperature measurement in this murine model of endotoxic shock can be viewed as a useful parameter which is per se sufficient to evaluate the health state of animals (mice) undergoing endotoxic shock.</p>
