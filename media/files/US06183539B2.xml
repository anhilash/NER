      The present invention relates to a novel adsorbent for removal of water and carbon dioxide from gases, and more particularly, an adsorbent for purification of air, nitrogen, hydrogen and natural gas streams.
      <br/>
      The invention is also a method of preparation of the adsorbent.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Carbon dioxide is an undesired impurity in many commercial gas applications owing to its ability to freeze and form hydrates with moisture at low temperatures.
      <br/>
      Formation of solids or solid particles makes gas processing, operation, transportation and storage quite difficult or even impossible.
      <br/>
      For example, cryogenic units for air separation to produce oxygen and nitrogen demand practically complete removal of carbon dioxide (1 ppm and less) and water vapor from air before separation.
      <br/>
      Refineries place similar requirements on the quantity of carbon dioxide and moisture present in hydrogen-contaminated gas flows.
      <br/>
      Similar requirements are placed on ammonia plants for nitrogen purity and gas processing plants on the carbon dioxide content and natural gas dew point prior to ethane and helium recovery and/or before natural gas liquefaction.
      <br/>
      Also, petrochemical plants have to eliminate carbon dioxide and water in monomers: ethylene, propylene, butadiene, etc. to prevent poisoning of the polymerization catalysts and deterioration of polymer properties.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Adsorption of carbon dioxide and water vapor is the most common method of removal of these compounds from gas streams due to high performance and relatively low capital and operational costs.
      <br/>
      Two adsorption techniques are commonly used in commercial gas manufacturing: temperature swing adsorption (TSA) and pressure swing adsorption (PSA).
      <br/>
      Efficiency of both adsorption processes is determined by the properties of the adsorbent.
      <br/>
      High adsorption of carbon dioxide is the most important property of the adsorbent, especially at very low partial pressures.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Several types of CO2 adsorbents have been created to meet industry needs.
      <br/>
      Because general duty adsorbents, such as alumina, silica gel and activated carbon, do not have a substantial adsorption capacity for carbon dioxide, more complex adsorbents have been prepared.
    </p>
    <p num="5">U.S. Pat. No. 3,865,924, Gidaspow, discloses a carbon dioxide adsorbent, which constitutes a mechanical mixture of activated alumina and alkali metal carbonates. U.S. Pat. No. 4,433,981, Slaugh, discloses an adsorbent prepared by impregnating alumina with an alkali or alkaline earth metal oxide or salt decomposable upon calcination. U.S. Pat. No. 4,493,715, Hogan, discloses an adsorbent for carbon dioxide removal from olefins which comprises alkali metal oxides, hydroxides, nitrates, acetates, etc. placed on an activated alumina.</p>
    <p num="6">
      All such adsorbents employ chemisorption or reversible chemical reactions to bind carbon dioxide to the metal carbonates or bicarbonates.
      <br/>
      The main disadvantage of these adsorbents is low operational reliability and short life due to the tendency of active components to sinter.
      <br/>
      Secondly, the time before water breakthrough on the majority of adsorbents is shorter than the time before the carbon dioxide breakthrough.
      <br/>
      This results in the need to employ supplemental desiccant beds.
    </p>
    <p num="7">It is also impossible to use base-containing adsorbents in the PSA-type units because they form compounds with CO2 that do not regenerate under reduced pressure.</p>
    <p num="8">
      A newer process for gas dehydration and carbon dioxide recovery technology uses molecular sieves, natural and synthetic zeolites.
      <br/>
      It is known that synthetic zeolite A and X types are effective adsorbents of CO2 and water.
      <br/>
      For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 3,981,698, Leppard, U.S. Pat. No. 4,039,620, Netteland, U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,645, Kumar, U.S. Pat. No. 4,986,835, Uno, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,156,657, Ravi, suggest the use of standard molecular sieves 5A, 10A and 13X as carbon dioxide adsorbents.
      <br/>
      These molecular sieves adsorb CO2 by physical adsorption and are regenerable at ambient temperatures.
      <br/>
      However, they do not possess sufficient adsorption capacity for carbon dioxide.
      <br/>
      Thus, such adsorbents cannot provide extensive gas purification, demand an increased loading volume and often require the use of supplemental adsorbent beds to decrease the water and carbon dioxide concentration prior to introduction into the zeolite bed.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      To increase carbon dioxide adsorption capacity, several adsorbents have been proposed based on various cation exchanged forms of molecular sieve X and other crystalline structures.
      <br/>
      Thus, U.S. Pat. No. 3,885,927, Sherman, discloses a barium cation form of zeolite X in which 90-95% of the Na+ ions are replaced by Ba2+ ions. U.S. Pat. No. 4,477,267, Reiss, utilizes an adsorbent for hydrogen purification containing CaX-zeolite.
      <br/>
      For carbon dioxide removal, U.S. Pat. No. 4,775,396, Rastelli, describes the use of zinc, rare earth metals, a proton and ammonium cation exchanged forms of synthetic faujasite having a silica: alumina ratio in broad range of 2-100. U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,003, Bulow, discloses the use of a natural or synthetic clinoptilolite, which contains as exchangeable cation the ions of metals of Groups 1A, 2A, 3A, 3B, the lanthanide group and mixtures of these.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      All of these molecular sieve adsorbents are characterized by carbon dioxide adsorption capacity extended at moderate and high partial pressures of the admixture to be adsorbed.
      <br/>
      However, their capacity to adsorb at low partial pressure of CO2 (&lt;5 torr) and at ambient temperatures is not sufficient to provide the purity of the gas required.
      <br/>
      In addition, due to the relatively short time before CO2 breakthrough, the water capacity of these adsorbents appears to be only 10-15 percent of potential.
      <br/>
      This decreases adsorbent performance in such applications as TSA and PSA air pre-purification units where carbon dioxide inlet adsorption is very low.
      <br/>
      Employing the above mentioned adsorbents in such applications demands gas chilling to a temperature below about 5 (degree)  C. In turn, this results in a substantial increase in operation and capital costs.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,531,808, Ojo, discloses an adsorbent for carbon dioxide adsorption comprising a type X zeolite having a silicon to aluminum ratio in the range of 1.0-1.15. The type X zeolite adsorbent contains ions of Group 1A, Group 2A, Group 3A, Group 3B, the lanthanide series and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      It fails to teach any critical quantitative relationship among various cations in the type X-zeolite crystalline structure that is necessary to provide high levels of adsorption capacity of carbon dioxide at low partial pressures and at ambient temperatures.
      <br/>
      It also fails to disclose preferable limits for crystalline purity and crystal sizes.
      <br/>
      It also does not disclose the adsorbent macroporosity limits necessary to provide the appropriate kinetics and dynamics of carbon dioxide adsorption.

      A process for preparing low-silica faujasite (LSF) with a silica/alumina ratio .about.2.0 is disclosed in Kuhl "Crystallization of Low-Silica Faujasite" Zeolites, vol. 7 p.451 (1987).
      <br/>
      Kuhl discloses that both sodium and potassium cations should be present to obtain faujasite crystals with relatively low silica content.
      <br/>
      The crystallization process disclosed comprises preparing a sodium aluminate water solution with addition of sodium and potassium hydroxides, mixing the solution with sodium silicate, aging the gelled mixture, and filtering and washing of the crystallization product.
      <br/>
      Kuhl also describes specific reagent ratios, temperatures and retention times, which are required for crystallization of the product.
      <br/>
      However, it does not specify the range of crystallization parameters that provide definite size of the faujasite crystals and a final product with a low content of admixture crystals of different types.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="22">
      The present invention is an adsorbent for carbon dioxide, and preferably water vapor, from gas streams where the adsorbent exhibits high adsorption capacity at low partial pressures and ambient temperatures.
      <br/>
      The adsorbent comprises a sodium form of a low silica faujasite, wherein the silica to alumina ratio is from about 1.8:1 to about 2.2:1, preferably about 2.0:1 to about 2.1:1, and wherein the content of the potassium ions present in the low silica faujasite constitute less than about 8.0 percent, preferably less than about 2.5 percent, most preferably less than about 1.0 percent of the exchangeable cations (equivalents).
      <br/>
      Preferably, the volume of the macro-pores in the range from about 1,000 to about 10,000  Angstrom  radii is greater than about 0.4 cm3 /g, preferably from about 0.4 to about 0.6 cm3 /g and most preferably from about 0.4 to about 0.5 cm3 /g.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The present invention also features a process for the production of the adsorbent product comprising preparing a sodium form of a low-silica faujasite, wherein the low-silica faujasite has a silica: alumina ratio of about 1.8:1 to about 2.2:1 and a residual content of potassium ions of less than about 8.0 percent (equiv.); blending the resultant product with a binder; forming the blended product into a shaped article; and drying and calcining the article to produce the adsorbent product.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 1 shows the carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms for low-silica faujasites having differing percentages of residual potassium cations.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 compares the carbon dioxide adsorption of various adsorbents including the present invention (Example 4) and other adsorbents, including a molecular sieve 5A (CaA-94.5 percent Ca+), molecular sieve 10A (CaX), molecular sieve 13X (NaX) and Example 16 showing a calcium low-silica faujasite with a potassium ion content of 0.16 percent.
    </p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="25">
      It is known to use low silica faujasites for the adsorption of carbon dioxide and water vapor from gas streams.
      <br/>
      It is also known that the substitution of sodium cations by other metal ions of larger size causes an increase in the adsorption capacity of standard faujasites with high silica content.
      <br/>
      For example, it is known that the calcium forms of a faujasite X zeolite having a silica/alumina ratio greater than 2.3:1 is characterized by higher adsorption capacities for carbon dioxide than sodium forms of these same faujasites.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Conventionally, low silica faujasite crystals are produced having a sodium: potassium ratio from about 2 to 3:8 to 7.
      <br/>
      It has been surprisingly discovered that by substituting sodium for substantially all of the potassium ions, the carbon dioxide adsorption capacity of the low silica faujasite increases significantly over conventional low silica faujasite with conventional ratios of sodium to potassium ions.
      <br/>
      It has also been surprisingly discovered that the fewer the potassium ions that are present in the low silica faujasite crystal structure and respectively, the more sodium ions that are present, the better the adsorption capacity for carbon dioxide of the adsorbent which is produced.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Previously, it had been discovered by Kuhl that the crystallization of low silica faujasite is typically accompanied by the formation of high silica faujasites, zeolite A, zeolite P, sodalite and other crystalline and amorphous admixtures.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that in order to create improved adsorption capacity for the adsorbent, the impurities that are conventionally present in low silica faujasite should be reduced as much as possible.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is preferable that the low silica faujasite utilized as an adsorbent contain at least about 90 percent, by weight, of the low silica faujasites, preferably at least about 95 percent, by weight, and most preferably at least about 98 percent, by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="28">In addition, it has also been discovered that in order to increase the adsorption capacity of the high sodium, low silica faujasites, at least about 80 percent of the low-silica faujasite crystals, by weight, should have a crystal size within a range of about 1 to 4  MU m, preferably 1 to 3  MU m and most preferably 1 to 2  MU m.</p>
    <p num="29">It has also been discovered that the volume of the macropores of a size with a radii from about 1,000 to 10,000 angstrom should be greater than about 0.4 cm3 /g, preferably from about 0.4 to about 0.6 cm3 /g and most preferably from about 0.4 to about 0.5 cm3 /g.</p>
    <p num="30">
      If these criteria for high sodium, low silica faujasites are satisfied, the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is enhanced in dynamic conditions.
      <br/>
      Without utilizing these preferred embodiments for the high sodium, low silica faujasites, the carbon dioxide adsorption in a flow on a molecular sieve adsorbent is limited by mass transfer inside adsorbent granules.
      <br/>
      Thus, the large macropore volume is required to provide the carbon dioxide molecules fast diffusion from the external surface of the adsorbent granules to the external surface of the crystals.
      <br/>
      Whereas, small size of zeolite crystals diminishes resistance to superficial diffusion inside the microcrystals.
    </p>
    <p num="31">In addition, the enhanced carbon dioxide capacity of the adsorbent of the present invention also increases the water adsorption capacity of the adsorbent up to 40-50 percent over conventional carbon dioxide adsorbents.</p>
    <p num="32">Generally, high sodium, low silica faujasites are created by preparing a water solution of sodium aluminate, sodium silicate, and sodium and potassium hydroxide whose ratios are expressed as mixtures of oxides within the following range:</p>
    <p num="33">
      --
      <br/>
      --           SiO2 :Al2 O3  1.9-2.2
      <br/>
      --           (Na2 O + K2 O):SiO2  3.0-3.4
      <br/>
      --           H2 O:(Na2 O + K2 O) 15.5-17.5
      <br/>
      --           Na2 O:(Na2 O + K2 O) 0.72-0.78
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The reaction mixture should be maintained at a temperature of about 850 to 95 (degree)  C. over the reaction process of 2-10 hours.
      <br/>
      Additionally, to provide the narrow distribution of low silica faujasite microcrystals so that their sizes will be in the range of about 1 to 4  MU m, preferably 1 to 3  MU m and most preferably 1 to 2  MU m, fine submicron powders of montmorillonite, such as Rym.RTM. Kill 10 MB, with particle size of 0.4-0.8  MU m in a quantity of 0.6-1.5 percent, by weight should be introduced under intensive stirring into the reaction mixture after about 15 to 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      The composition is then stirred for at least about 2 hours and maintained at a temperature of about 85 (degree)  to 95 (degree)  C. during stirring.
      <br/>
      The crystals produced are filtered from the reaction solution.
      <br/>
      The crystals obtained from this reaction are then washed with deionized water to maintain the pH of the crystals in a range from about 10.5 to about 11.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Once these crystals are obtained, the potassium ion content of the low silica faujasites must be reduced to levels less than about 8 percent, preferably less than 2.5 percent, most preferably about 1.0 percent.</p>
    <p num="36">
      There are several methodologies that may be used to produce this type of high sodium, low silica faujasite.
      <br/>
      For example, a powder exchange can be performed on a belt filter with from one to three stages of sodium chloride solution feed.
      <br/>
      The concentration of the sodium chloride solution should be increased in each stage so that the equivalent ratio of sodium in solution to potassium in zeolite reaches 1.5 during the first stage, 2.2 during the second stage, and 3.0 during the third stage.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In an alternative method, calcined sodium/potassium, low silica faujasite beads can be ion exchanged in a column with a sodium chloride solution (10-15 percent by weight) or preferably with a sodium chloride plus sodium hydroxide solution (7-10 percent NaCl+3-5 percent NaOH), by weight, at a temperature of about 600 to 85 (degree)  C. In either process, the ion exchanged product is washed with deionized water to remove excess sodium ion.
      <br/>
      Both of these processes produce adsorbents with a potassium content of less than about 8.0 percent, preferably less than about 2.5 percent, and most preferably, less than about 1.0 percent (equiv.).
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The high sodium, low silica faujasite zeolite powder obtained is then admixed with a binder to produce a final adsorbent product.
      <br/>
      The binder can be chosen from mineral or synthetic materials, such as clays (kaolinite, bentonite, montmorillonite, attapulgite or other such clay materials), silica, alumina, alumina hydrate (pseudoboehmite), alumina trihydrate, alumosilicates, cements or other such materials.
      <br/>
      The binder comprises about 15-40 percent by weight of the final adsorbent.
      <br/>
      The mixture is then kneaded with 18-35 percent, by weight, water to form a paste which is then aggregated to form shaped articles of conventional shapes.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In a preferred embodiment certain peptizers and/or pore-forming ingredients are aggregated with the molecular sieve product and/or with the binder in an amount from about 0.5 to about 2.0 percent of the final adsorbent product by weight to produce the extended macropore volume required.
      <br/>
      Such additives typically include mineral acids, surfactants and plasticizers such as, for example, polyalkeneglycols, polyacrylamides, polycarboxylates, natural organic products such as starches, molasses, lignin or other such related material.
      <br/>
      Following this addition, the shaped product is cured, dried and calcined at a temperature from about 550 (degree)  C. to about 650 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Utilizing high sodium, low silica faujasite particles produced by the above-described process creates a product which is particularly useful for the adsorption of carbon dioxide and water vapor from gas streams.
      <br/>
      The preferred types of gas streams in which this type of high sodium, low silica faujasite crystals can be utilized includes air, nitrogen, hydrogen, natural gas, individual hydrocarbons and monomers, such as ethylene, propylene, 1.3 butadiene, isoprene and other such gas systems.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      It has been surprisingly discovered that high sodium, low silica faujasite with a potassium content less than about 2.5 percent (equiv.), when utilized in a conventional air pre-purification process, reduces the carbon dioxide level in the gas stream generally to a range of 0.3 ppm to about 0.5 ppm which is significantly lower over the same length of the adsorbent bed than that of conventional low silica faujasites with a sodium content of about 62 percent to about 90 percent (equiv.).
      <br/>
      These conventional low silica faujasites reduce the CO2 content only to about 2 ppm.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously the dynamic adsorption capacity of the high sodium, low silica faujasite for water is also increased from about 1.5 percent up to about 3.5 percent (by weight).
      <br/>
      Therefore, it has been surprisingly discovered that low silica faujasites with a potassium content less than about 8.0 percent (equivalent), preferably less than 2.5 percent (equivalent), and most preferably, less than about 1.0 percent (equivalent) are highly efficient in the adsorption of both carbon dioxide and water vapor in conventional gas stream operations.

      The adsorbent can be used at new or existing plants.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the combination of high sodium, low-silica faujasite with very low content of residual potassium ions has a number of advantages:
      <br/>
      (1) it provides a high level of carbon dioxide and water vapor adsorption for gas purification;
      <br/>
      (2) it allows the effective adsorption of carbon dioxide at ambient temperatures and low partial pressures of carbon dioxide that reduces capital and operation costs in air pre-purification and inorganic gas manufacturing;
      <br/>
      (3) it provides satisfactory dynamics for both Pressure Swing Adsorption and Temperature Swing Adsorption processes;
      <br/>
      (4) it allows gas purification units in one bed without the supplemental use of desiccants, such as silica gel, activated alumina, molecular sieves 3A, 4A, etc.
      <br/>
      (5) it provides reliable and efficient technology for adsorbent preparation and manufacturing.
