      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, and more particularly, to a semiconductor device which can improve an isolation characteristic and prevent a leakage current in conducting a borderless process, and a method for fabricating the same.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Background of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A related art method for fabricating a semiconductor device will be explained with reference to the attached drawings.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1A.about.1G illustrate sections showing the steps of a related art method for fabricating a semiconductor device.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Referring to FIG. 1A, the related art method for fabricating a semiconductor device starts with depositing an initial oxide film 2 and a nitride film 3 on a semiconductor substrate 1 having an active region and a field region defined thereon.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1B, the nitride film is subjected to selective patterning to expose the initial oxide film 2 in the field region.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Then the patterned nitride film 3 is used as a mask to etch the semiconductor substrate 1 to form trenches therein.
      <br/>
      The trenches may be formed by coating a photoresist film on an entire surface, patterning the photoresist film to expose the field region, and etching the semiconductor substrate 1.
      <br/>
      Then, a first oxide film 4 is deposited in the trenches by thermal oxidization.
      <br/>
      A buried insulating film is then deposited on an entire surface and etched by chemical mechanical polishing or etch back, to planarize the buried insulating film and the nitride film 3, thereby forming a trench isolation region 5 projected from an upper plane of the semiconductor substrate, as shown in FIG. 1C.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Then, as shown in FIG. 1D, the nitride film 3 and the initial oxide film 2 on the active region are removed.</p>
    <p num="8">
      As shown in FIG. 1E, a gate oxide film 6 is formed on the exposed active region, and a polysilicon layer 7 is deposited on an entire surface for forming a gate electrode.
      <br/>
      This can result in local recesses 13 at edges of a trench region caused by too much insulating film being removed by wet etching conducted before the gate oxide film is formed.
      <br/>
      This causes a gate-wraparound in which a recess portion at an edge in the active region is wrapped around by the gate electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      As shown in FIG. 1F, a mask for forming a gate is used in patterning the polysilicon layer 7 and the gate oxide film 6, to form a stack of a gate electrode 8 and a gate oxide film 6.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor substrate 1 on both sides of the gate electrode 8 is lightly doped with impurity ions.
      <br/>
      Then, an oxide film or a nitride film is deposited on an entire surface and etched back, to form sidewall spacers 9 at sides of the gate electrode 8 and the gate oxide film 6.
      <br/>
      Then the semiconductor substrate 1 on opposite sides of the sidewall spacers 9, excluding a portion under the gate electrode 8, is heavily with impurity ions, to form LDD source/drain regions 10.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 1G, a planar protection film 11 is deposited on an entire surface.
      <br/>
      Then a contact hole is formed to each of the source/drain regions 10, and a contact plug 12 is formed in each of the contact holes.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1G, if the contact holes are misaligned so that the trench isolation region 5 is reached in addition to reaching the source/drain region 10.
      <br/>
      Then the problem arises that the contact plug 12 will also make in contact with the semiconductor substrate 1 at an interface of the active region and the field region.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The aforementioned related art method for fabricating a semiconductor device has the following problems.</p>
    <p num="12">First, the thin gate oxide film, formed at recess portion 13, shortens a device lifetime because the gate oxide film is susceptible to loss.</p>
    <p num="13">Second, as a thickness of the gate oxide film in a recess region becomes thinner due to loss of an edge portion in a trench isolation region, the device becomes more likely to degrade due to an inverse narrow width effect in which a threshold voltage decreases as a width of the gate is reduced.</p>
    <p num="14">Third, a short between the contact plug and the semiconductor substrate occurs when the contact hole is misaligned to reach to the field region, which causes a leakage current.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a semiconductor device and a method for fabricating the same that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="23">
      As devices become highly integrated, particularly for fabrication of a logic device or SRAM, ways to increase contact alignment tolerance have been explored.
      <br/>
      One way is to make an active region larger in an area in which a contact is to be made, where the active region is formed in a straight line with a fixed height.
      <br/>
      However, this method does not allow high density integration of the devices.
      <br/>
      A borderless contact process can be used, which allows high density integration of devices and prevention of leakage current coming from misalignment.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The present invention utilizes the borderless contact process, and the semiconductor device and the method for fabricating the same of the present invention will be explained with reference to the attached drawings.
      <br/>
      At first, the semiconductor device of the present invention will be explained.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2A illustrates a plan view of a semiconductor device in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 2B illustrates a section across line I--I in FIG. 2A, FIG. 3A illustrates a plan view of a semiconductor device in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 3B illustrates a section across line II--II in FIG. 3A.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Referring to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the semiconductor device in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a semiconductor substrate 31 having trenches formed in a field region and a thin third oxide film 38 formed along surfaces of the trenches.
      <br/>
      Nitride film spacers 34 are projected from the semiconductor substrate 31 along interfaces of the active region and the field region.
      <br/>
      A gate line 41 is formed on a central portion of the active region in one direction.
      <br/>
      The gate line 41 has a stack of a first polysilicon layer 36 patterned on the active region and a second polysilicon layer 40 in a form of a line (see FIG. 4J).
      <br/>
      A buried insulating film 39 is formed at the same height as the first polysilicon 36 layer patterned on the isolation region inclusive of the trench (see FIG. 4I).
    </p>
    <p num="26">In FIG. 2B, there are LDD source/drain regions 43 formed in the active region on both sides of the gate line 41, and a self-aligned silicide (salicide) layer 44 on top of the gate line 41 and on surfaces of the source/drain regions 43.</p>
    <p num="27">
      A planar protection film 45 having contact holes to the source/drain regions 43 is formed on an entire surface of a resultant body.
      <br/>
      Contact plugs 46 in the contact holes make contact with the source/drain regions 43.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The related art problem of the gate oxide film 38 being too thin at corners of the trench where the buried insulating film 39 in the trench in the field region assumes a step configuration next to the boundary with the active region because nitride film sidewall spacers 34 are formed along a periphery of the active region.
      <br/>
      Therefore, even if the contact hole is formed at the boundary of the active region, no degradation occurs to generate a leakage current.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the first embodiment of the present invention, the nitride film sidewall spacers 34 are formed along a boundary of the active region to compensate for thin spots in the insulating film 38 by acting as an additional barrier in formation of the contact holes.
    </p>
    <p num="29">In a second embodiment of the present invention, the nitride film barriers formed along boundary of the active region in the first embodiment are extended to the field region, which will be explained with reference to the drawings.</p>
    <p num="30">
      Referring to FIGS. 3A and 3B, the semiconductor device in accordance with the second preferred embodiment of the present invention includes nitride film barriers 51, formed at a boundary of the active region, that extend from the edge of the trench into the field region.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, leakage current to the semiconductor substrate 31 can be prevented even if the contact hole is misaligned to reach to the field region.
      <br/>
      Other structures of the second embodiment semiconductor device are the same with the first embodiment semiconductor device.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      A method for forming the aforementioned semiconductor device of the present invention will be explained.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 4A.about.4L illustrate sections showing the steps of a method for fabricating a semiconductor device in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention, and FIGS. 5A.about.5F illustrate sections showing the steps of a method for fabricating a semiconductor device in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="32">Referring to FIG. 4A, the method for fabricating a semiconductor device in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention starts by forming a first oxide film 32 on a semiconductor substrate 31 to a thickness of 100 A.about.200 A by chemical vapor deposition or thermal oxidization and depositing a first nitride film 33 on the first oxide film 32 to a thickness of 1000 A.about.2000 A.</p>
    <p num="33">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 4B, a photoresist film(not shown) is coated on the first nitride film 33.
      <br/>
      After field and active regions are defined, the photoresist film is patterned, to expose the first nitride film 33 in the active region.
      <br/>
      Then, the patterned photoresist film is used as a mask in dry etching the first nitride film 33 until the first oxide film 32 in the active region is exposed.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Next, as shown in FIG. 4C, a second nitride film is deposited by chemical vapor deposition, and the first oxide film 32 is etched back, to form nitride film sidewall spacers 34 to a thickness ranging 300 A.about.500 A.</p>
    <p num="35">Then, as shown in FIG. 4D, the exposed first oxide film 32 is removed, a gate oxide film 35 is formed, and a first polysilicon layer 36 is deposited on an entire surface of a resultant body for forming a gate electrode.</p>
    <p num="36">Then the first polysilicon layer 36 is planarized by chemical mechanical polishing or etch back, to leave the first polysilicon layer 36 only on the active region, as shown in FIG. 4E. The planarization removes enough material to expose the surface of the first nitride film 33.</p>
    <p num="37">Then an exposed surface of the first polysilicon 36 is oxidized to form a second oxide film 37 to a thickness of 200 A.about.1000 A, as shown in FIG. 4F.</p>
    <p num="38">As shown in FIG. 4G, then the first nitride film 33 and the first oxide film 32 on the field region are dry etched to leave the nitride film sidewall spacers 34 at a boundary of the active region, and to expose the semiconductor substrate 31.</p>
    <p num="39">
      As shown in FIG. 4H, the semiconductor substrate 31 is etched to a depth of 2500 A.about.4000 A, using the second oxide film 37 as a mask, to form a trench.
      <br/>
      Then the substrate 31 is subjected to thermal oxidation to form a third oxide film 38 to a thickness of 50 A.about.200 A. A buried insulating film 39 is then deposited to fill in the trench.
    </p>
    <p num="40">As shown in FIG. 4I, the buried insulating film 39, the second oxide film 37, the first polysilicon layer 36 and the nitride film sidewall spacers 34 are polished flat by chemical mechanical polishing.</p>
    <p num="41">Then a second polysilicon layer 40 is deposited to a thickness of 500 A.about.1000 A on an entire surface of a resultant body as a material for forming a gate, as shown in FIG. 4J. A metal may be deposited instead of the second polysilicon layer 40.</p>
    <p num="42">
      As shown in FIG. 4K, then a mask for forming a gate is used to subject the first and second polysilicon layers 36 and 40 and the gate oxide film 35 to anisotropic etching to form a gate line 41 to cross approximately at center of the active region.
      <br/>
      Then, after lightly doping the active region on both sides of the gate line 41 with impurity ions, an oxide film or a nitride film is deposited on an entire surface and etched back to form gate sidewall spacers 42 at both sides of the gate line 41.
      <br/>
      The active region, on opposite sides of the gate sidewall spacers 42, excluding a portion under the gate line 41, is heavily doped with impurity ions to form source/drain regions 43.
      <br/>
      The nitride film sidewall spacers 34 are projected along a periphery of the active region.
      <br/>
      Then, a metal layer is deposited on an entire surface and heat treated, to form a salicide layer 44 on a surface of the gate line 41.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      As shown in FIG. 4L, after forming a planar protection film 45 on an entire surface of a resultant body, contact holes are formed to expose the source/drain regions 43.
      <br/>
      And, contact plugs 46 are formed in the contact holes.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      A method for fabricating a semiconductor device in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained.
      <br/>
      A method for forming a structure as shown in FIG. 5A is identical to a method according to FIGS. 4A.about.4H in the first embodiment of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 5B, the buried insulating film 39, the second oxide film 37, the first nitride film 33, and the nitride film sidewall spacers 34 are etched flat by chemical mechanical polishing.
      <br/>
      The nitride film sidewall spacers 34 at a boundary of the active region are dry etched to form a groove.
      <br/>
      Then, the buried insulating film 39 at one side of the groove is wet etched to extend a width of the groove from the boundary of the active region to the field region.
      <br/>
      The width of the extended groove is in a range of 150 A.about.300 A.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Next, as shown in FIG. 5C, a third nitride film is deposited on an entire surface of a resultant body.
      <br/>
      It is etched back to leave the third nitride film only in the groove so as to form a nitride film barrier 51.
    </p>
    <p num="47">Then a second polysilicon layer 40 is deposited on an entire surface of a resultant body to a thickness of 500 A.about.1000 A as a material for forming a gate as shown in FIG. 5D.</p>
    <p num="48">As shown in FIG. 5E, then the first and second polysilicon layers 36 and 40 and the gate oxide film 35 are subjected to anisotropic etching using a mask to form a gate line 41.</p>
    <p num="49">
      The gate line 41 crosses at approximately the center of the active region.
      <br/>
      The active region on both sides of the gate line 41 is lightly doped with impurity ions, and an oxide film or nitride film is deposited on an entire surface and etched back to form gate sidewall spacers 42 at both sides of the gate line 41.
      <br/>
      The active region on opposite sides of the gate sidewall spacers 42, excluding a portion under the gate line 41, is heavily doped with impurity ions, to form source/drain regions 43.
      <br/>
      The nitride film barrier 51 remains along a portion that extends to the field region from the boundary of the active region.
      <br/>
      Then, a metal layer is deposited on an entire surface and heat treated, to form a salicide layer 44 on a surface of the gate line 41.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      And, as shown in FIG. 5F, a planar protection film 45 is deposited on an entire surface of a resultant body, and contact holes are formed to expose the source/drain regions 43.
      <br/>
      Then, contact plugs 46 are formed in the contact holes.
      <br/>
      A result is that the contact plug 46 makes no short with the semiconductor substrate 31 even if the contact plug 46 is misaligned to reach to the field region.
    </p>
    <p num="51">The semiconductor device and the method for fabricating the same of the present invention has the following advantages.</p>
    <p num="52">First, the buried insulating film formed to have a step to the semiconductor substrate and the nitride film barrier formed at a boundary of the active region make electric field stronger at corners of the trench, which prevents device degradation.</p>
    <p num="53">Second, the buried insulating film and the nitride film barrier thus formed prevents device degradation caused by inverse narrow width effect.</p>
    <p num="54">Third, the nitride film barrier at a boundary of the active region prevents leakage current caused by a short between the contact plug and the semiconductor substrate.</p>
    <p num="55">
      It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the semiconductor device and the method for fabricating the same of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
