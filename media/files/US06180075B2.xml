    <heading>INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an automotive exhaust gas catalyst which has a single-layered, catalytically active coating of high surface area support oxides on an inert carrier structure, wherein the coating contains palladium as the only catalytically active noble metal.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Internal combustion engines emit carbon monoxide CO, unburnt hydrocarbons HC and nitrogen oxides NOx as the main pollutants in the exhaust gas, a high percentage of these being converted into the harmless components water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen by modern exhaust gas treatment catalysts.
      <br/>
      Conversion takes place under substantially stoichiometric conditions, that is the oxygen in the exhaust gas is controlled using a so-called lambda sensor in such a way that the oxidation of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and the reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen can take place almost quantitatively.
      <br/>
      The catalysts developed for this purpose are called three-way catalytic converters.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Stoichiometric conditions prevail when the normalized air/fuel-ratio  LAMBDA  is 1.
      <br/>
      The normalized air/fuel-ratio  LAMBDA  is the air/fuel ratio standardized to stoichiometric conditions.
      <br/>
      The air/fuel ratio states how many kilograms of air are required for complete combustion of one kilogram of fuel.
      <br/>
      In the case of conventional gasoline engine fuels, the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio has a value of 14.6. The engine exhaust gas has more or less large, periodic variations in normalized air/fuel-ratio depending on the load and the engine speed.
      <br/>
      To produce better conversion of oxidizable hazardous components under these conditions, oxygen-storing components such as, for example, cerium oxide are used which bind oxygen when it is present in excess and release it again for oxidative conversion when there is a deficiency of oxygen in the exhaust gas.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Future exhaust gas limits for internal combustion engines require an increasingly stringent reduction in the emissions of hazardous substances in standardized driving cycles.
      <br/>
      Given the current status of exhaust gas treatment, the hazardous substance emissions which still remain are produced during the cold-start phase.
      <br/>
      A substantially improved hazardous substance conversion over an entire driving cycle is therefore only possible by reducing cold-start emissions.
      <br/>
      This can be achieved, for example, by a catalyst with the lowest possible light-off temperature for hazardous substance conversions and/or by locating the catalyst only just downstream of the exhaust gas outlet from the engine in order to reduce the heating-up time required to reach the operating temperature of the catalyst.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      If the catalyst is installed near to the engine, it is subjected to exhaust gas temperatures of up to 1100 (degree)  C. during continuous operation of the engine, and at full speed.
      <br/>
      Thus catalysts which are temperature-resistant and have long-term stability are required for this type of use.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention deals with catalyst coatings on inert, monolithic support structures, normally honeycomb structures with parallel flow channels for the exhaust gas.
      <br/>
      The number of flow channels per cross-sectional area is called the cell density.
      <br/>
      Inert carriers with cell densities between 10 and 250 cm-2 are used, depending on the requirements of the application.
      <br/>
      These may be extruded, ceramic carriers made from cordierite, mullite or similar, temperature resistant materials.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, honeycomb structures made from steel sheeting may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The catalytic coating generally contains several noble metals from the platinum group of the Periodic System of elements as catalytically active components, these being deposited in highly dispersed form on the specific surface area of high surface area support materials.
      <br/>
      The coating also contains further components such as oxygen-storing materials, promoters and stabilizers.
      <br/>
      The coating is applied to the internal walls of the flow channels by known coating processes, using an aqueous coating dispersion which contains the various components of the catalyst.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The inert monolithic carriers are also called support carriers in the context of this invention in order to be able to differentiate them more easily from the high surface area support materials for the catalytically active components.
      <br/>
      High surface area materials are those materials whose specific surface area, or BET surface area (measured in accordance with DIN 66132), is at least 10 m2 /g.
      <br/>
      So-called active aluminum oxides satisfy this condition.
      <br/>
      These are finely divided aluminum oxides which have the crystal structures of the so-called transition phases of aluminum oxide.
      <br/>
      These include chi, delta, gamma, kappa, theta and eta-aluminum oxide.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The catalyst components may be added to the coating dispersion in a variety of forms:</p>
    <p num="11">a) as "finely divided solids"</p>
    <p num="12">This is understood to mean powdered materials with particle sizes between 1 and about 50  MU m. In the English language literature, the expressions "bulk material" or "particulate material" are used for these.</p>
    <p num="13">b) as "colloidal solids"</p>
    <p num="14">These have particle sizes of less than 1  MU m. The particulate structure of finely divided and colloidal solids is retained even in the final catalyst coating.</p>
    <p num="15">c) in the form of soluble "precursor compounds"</p>
    <p num="16">Precursor compounds are converted into actual catalyst components only by subsequent calcination and optionally reduction and are then present in a highly dispersed form.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The catalytically active metals from the platinum group or stabilizers such as lanthanum oxide and barium oxide are preferably incorporated into the coating as soluble precursor compounds in the coating dispersion or introduced only later by impregnating the coating.
      <br/>
      After a subsequent calcination procedure, these materials are present in a highly dispersed form (crystallite sizes in general of less than 5-10 nm) on the specific surface areas of the high surface area, finely divided components of the catalyst.
      <br/>
      They are also called "highly dispersed materials" in the context of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The aim of the present invention is to develop a catalyst suitable for use in the area mentioned above which operates exclusively with palladium as the catalytically active noble metal.
      <br/>
      Palladium is characterized, as compared with platinum, by a lower price, which is important with regard to the economic viability of the catalyst.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is known that palladium is a very effective catalyst for the oxidation of unburnt hydrocarbons, in particular paraffins and aromatic compounds.
      <br/>
      It has a superior effect, with reference to the same mass, to that of platinum.

No. 4,624,940 describes a three-way catalytic converter in the form of a coating on a monolithic support carrier which contains only palladium as a catalytically active component and which retains its catalytic activity even after aging at temperatures higher than 1000 (degree)  C. The coating contains at least three different finely divided materials: thermally stable aluminum oxide as support material for a metal from the platinum group, further metal oxides as promoters which do not contain metals from the platinum group and inert, thermally stable fillers.
      <br/>
      The support material is stabilized with lanthanum, barium and silicon.
      <br/>
      The lanthanum oxide used for stabilizing purposes may contain up to 10 wt. % of praseodymium oxide.
      <br/>
      Cerium oxide, zirconium oxide or mixtures thereof are used as promoters.
      <br/>
      Finely divided cordierite, mullite, magnesium/aluminum titanate and mixtures thereof are used as fillers.
      <br/>
      Palladium is preferably used as a metal from the platinum group.
      <br/>
      According to U.S. Pat. No. 4,624,940, care has to be taken to ensure that palladium is not deposited on the cerium oxide-containing promoters because this would impair the effectiveness of both the palladium and the promoter.

      <br/>
      The first layer may also contain finely divided iron oxide and nickel oxide to suppress hydrogen sulphide emissions and also highly dispersed barium oxide and zirconium oxide as thermal stabilizers, these being distributed throughout the entire layer.
      <br/>
      The second layer contains a coprecipitated cerium/zirconium mixed oxide, onto which rhodium is deposited, and an activated aluminum oxide as support material for platinum.

    <p num="24">It is an object of the present invention to provide a catalyst which contains only palladium as the catalytically active noble metal, which can be prepared very cost-effectively and which has, in addition to good degrees of conversion for hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, exceptional heat and aging resistance.</p>
    <p num="25">This and other objects are achieved by an automotive exhaust gas catalyst which contains, on a carrier structure, a single-layered, catalytic coating containing the following components:</p>
    <p num="26">
      a) finely divided, stabilized, active aluminum oxide,
      <br/>
      b) at least one finely divided oxygen-storing component,
      <br/>
      c) optionally, finely divided nickel oxide,
      <br/>
      d) and additional highly dispersed cerium oxide, zirconium oxide and barium oxide and
      <br/>
      e) as the only catalytically active noble metal, palladium which is in close contact with all the components in the coating.
    </p>
    <p num="27">GAMMA -aluminum oxide with a specific surface area of more than 100 m2 /g and stabilized with lanthanum is preferably used for the catalyst. 2 to 4 wt. % of lanthanum oxide, which may for example be incorporated in the aluminum oxide in a known manner by impregnation, is sufficient for stabilizing purposes.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="28">
      The present invention will now be described in further detail.
      <br/>
      A cerium/zirconium mixed oxide which can be obtained, for example, by coprecipitation in the way described in EP 0605274 A1 is preferably used as an oxygen-storing component.
      <br/>
      The material preferably contains 15 to 35 wt. % of zirconium oxide, with reference to its total weight.
      <br/>
      If the amount of zirconium oxide is less than 15 wt. %, the aging resistance of the material is no longer sufficient.
      <br/>
      Due to its high cerium oxide content, this material has an outstanding oxygen-storage capacity.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      If very high temperatures of up to 1100 (degree)  C. are expected during use of the catalyst, it is recommended that the mixed oxide mentioned above be replaced, entirely or partly, by a zirconium-rich cerium/zirconium mixed oxide containing 70 to 90 wt. % of zirconium oxide.
      <br/>
      Due to its high zirconium oxide content, this material is particularly heat resistant, but it has a lower oxygen-storage capacity in the freshly-prepared state.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As an alternative to this, a material may also be used which comprises cerium oxide in highly dispersed form on finely divided zirconium oxide.
      <br/>
      The highly dispersed cerium oxide may be fixed on the zirconium oxide by impregnation followed by calcination.
      <br/>
      This material has sufficient oxygen-storage capacity even with a cerium oxide concentration of only 10 to 30 wt. %. Highly dispersed mixtures of cerium oxide and praseodymium oxide on zirconium oxide are also particularly advantageous, wherein 1 to 20 wt. % of praseodymium oxide is present, with reference to cerium oxide.
    </p>
    <p num="31">Another finely divided oxygen-storage component, which is characterized by particularly good aging stability, is obtained by impregnating the cerium-rich cerium/zirconium mixed oxide mentioned above with 1 to 10 wt. %, with reference to the total weight of the final component, of praseodymium oxide.</p>
    <p num="32">
      The ratio by weight in the catalyst between active aluminum oxide, the oxygen-storing component and additional highly dispersed cerium oxide, zirconium oxide, barium oxide and finely divided nickel oxide is preferably adjusted to:
      <br/>
      100:20-100:15-40:20-40:10-30:0-10.
    </p>
    <p num="33">Optimum light-off temperatures and activities for the catalyst are produced when the amount of catalyst coating on the carrier structure is between 50 and 600 g/l of carrier structure volume and the palladium concentration is between 1 and 15, preferably 2 to 5 g/l of carrier structure volume.</p>
    <p num="34">
      The actual amount of coating used on the carrier structure depends on the specifications for hazardous substance conversion and long-term stability as well as on the cell density of the honeycomb structure.
      <br/>
      Average layer thicknesses of about 30 to 50  MU m are preferably produced on the channel walls.
      <br/>
      The amount of coating required for this is 50 to 600 g/l of carrier structure volume, depending on the cell density, wherein the upper value is used for carrier structures with cell densities of 250 cm-2.
      <br/>
      The larger the amount of coating on a given carrier structure, the greater is the risk that the exhaust gas pressure will rise to an excessive extent due to narrowing of the flow channels, thus reducing the power of the engine.
      <br/>
      This effect restricts the amount of coating which can realistically be applied to a maximum value.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      To prepare the catalyst, an aqueous coating dispersion is made up by dispersing the active aluminum oxide, the oxygen-storing component and optionally nickel oxide in powdered form in water, with the addition of soluble cerium oxide, zirconium oxide and barium oxide precursors.
      <br/>
      The inner walls of the flow channels in a honeycomb carrier structure made of ceramic or metal is coated with this coating dispersion by, for example, immersion.
      <br/>
      In the case of carrier structures made from strips of metal sheeting, the films may also be applied to the strips before shaping into the carrier structure.
      <br/>
      After drying and calcining the coating, palladium is deposited on all the components in the coating in highly dispersed form by immersing the carrier structure in an aqueous impregnating solution of soluble precursors of palladium.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      As an alternative to this procedure, there is also the possibility of first making up a coating powder which contains all the components for the catalyst.
      <br/>
      Here, an aqueous dispersion of powdered aluminum oxide, the oxygen-storing component and optionally nickel oxide as well as soluble cerium oxide, zirconium oxide and barium oxide precursors is made up.
      <br/>
      The dispersion is dewatered, dried and calcined.
      <br/>
      The coating powder obtained in this way is then redispersed, a palladium precursor is added and it is then applied to the inner walls of the carrier structure using known methods.
      <br/>
      The coating obtained in this way is then dried and calcined.
      <br/>
      Calcination may optionally be performed in a hydrogen-containing stream of gas at 300 to 500 (degree)  C. (for example, forming gas consisting of 5 vol-% hydrogen, the remainder being nitrogen) to reduce the palladium.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Both alternative methods of preparation for the catalyst ensure the close contact between palladium and all the other components in the catalyst which is required by the manner in which the palladium is applied.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Suitable soluble precursors of cerium oxide, zirconium oxide and barium oxide are nitrates, ammonium nitrates, chlorides, oxalates, acetates, citrates, formates, propionates, thiocyanates and oxychlorides of cerium, zirconium and barium.
      <br/>
      Nitrates and acetates are preferably used.
      <br/>
      A variety of palladium salts are suitable as precursors of palladium.
      <br/>
      Palladium nitrate is preferably also used here.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The drying stages used during preparation of the catalyst are not critical.
      <br/>
      They may be performed in air in the temperature range between 100 and 180 (degree)  C. for a period of 0.25 to 2 hours.
      <br/>
      Calcination is preferably performed at temperatures between 300 and 800 (degree)  C. for a period of 0.5 to 3 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      To homogenize the coating dispersion, this is usually milled in a ball mill until an average particle size d50 of 1 to 5, preferably 3 to 5  MU m is reached for the finely divided material to be used (d50 is understood to represent the particle diameter which is greater than or equal to the diameter of 50 wt.% of the material).
      <br/>
      To improve turbulence of the exhaust gas in the flow channels, a coarse-grained but high surface area material may be added to the coating dispersion, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,788. This roughens the surface of the final coating and causes turbulence in the exhaust gas and thus an improvement in material exchange between the exhaust gas and the catalyst coating.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Depending on the consistency of the coating dispersion, the required amount of coating may be extracted onto the carrier structure by immersing the carrier structure, for example, once or several times.
      <br/>
      The solids content and viscosity of the coating dispersion are preferably adjusted in such a way that the amount of coating required can be applied in a single coating procedure.
      <br/>
      This is the case, for example, when the solids content of the coating dispersion is 30 to 70 wt.% and the density is 1.4 to 1.8 kg/dm3.

      The more intense aging procedure was performed using a 2.0 1 gasoline engine at an exhaust gas temperature of 1050 (degree)  C. for a period of 40 hours.
      <br/>
      The space velocity during measurement of the rates of conversion was again 50,000 h-1.
