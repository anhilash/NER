    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to hydrous EVOH pellets derived from an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer hydrolyzate (in other words, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer; hereinafter referred to as EVOH for short), a process for the production thereof, and moldings from such EVOH pellets, in particular moldings in the form of films.</p>
    <heading>PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="2">EVOHs are excellent in such characteristics as gas barrier property, transparency, aroma-retaining property, solvent resistance and oil resistance and, therefore, used in the form of moldings such as films, sheets or bottles or other containers in various packaging applications as food packaging materials, drug packaging materials, industrial chemical packaging materials, agrochemical packaging materials, etc.</p>
    <p num="3">
      A process for producing EVOH films generally comprises molding EVOH pellets into films using a melt extruder or the like, followed, as necessary, by uniaxial or biaxial drawing or stretching.
      <br/>
      On that occasion of molding, it is a common practice to melt mold an anhydrous or nearly anhydrous EVOH at a temperature of about 200 (degree)  C. On the occasion of such melt molding, however, gelation and/or eye mucus-like substance formation may occur during melt molding, making long-run molding difficult, or die lines and/or fish eyes may be formed in the product EVOH films, or the EVOH films may be inferior in transparency, in many instances.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In Japanese Patent Publication No. 29578/1972 (the applicant being the same as in the present application), a melt molding process for smoothly carrying out the melt molding of EVOHs is disclosed which comprises allowing an EVOH to uniformly absorb water in an amount of 20 to 60 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the EVOH at a temperature of not lower than 40 (degree)  C. in advance of melt molding of the EVOH and then feeding the EVOH to an extruder for melt molding.
      <br/>
      As regards the procedure for water absorption, it is stated that the method comprising introducing an EVOH in the form of a powder, granules, pellets or the like into water, followed by stirring, the method comprising adding a predetermined amount of water with stirring or the method comprising contacting an EVOH with steam may be employed.
      <br/>
      In the examples, an EVOH powder is introduced into water for allowing it to absorb water.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, the technology of Japanese Patent Publication No. 29578/1972 still has room for improvement with respect to long-period continuous operability and to appearance and stability of quality of product EVOH moldings.
      <br/>
      In particular, when films are obtained and stretched, there is need for further improving the uniformity in drawing and the appearance and quality of stretched films.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">As a result of their intensive investigations made from the viewpoint of performing melt molding of EVOHs in hydrous state using hydrous EVOH pellets, the present inventors found that hydrous pellets having a specific water content and a specific elastic modulus and preferably having a specific alcohol or a specific compound are suited for use from the viewpoint of continuous moldability, quality of moldings and stretchability of moldings.</p>
    <p num="7">Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide hydrous EVOH pellets improved in moldability and capable of providing moldings with good appearance and quality and good stretchability, to provide a process for producing such hydrous pellets and to provide moldings molded using such hydrous pellets.</p>

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">&lt;EVOH (A)&gt;</p>
    <p num="14">
      The EVOH (A) to be suitably used in producing hydrous EVOH pellets according to the present invention has an ethylene content of 5 to 60 mole percent, preferably 10 to 60 mole percent, more preferably 20 to 55 mole percent, and a degree of saponification of the vinyl acetate component of not less than 90 mole percent, preferably not less than 95 mole percent, most preferably not less than 98 mole percent.
      <br/>
      If the ethylene content is less than 5 mole percent, the water resistance will be insufficient.
      <br/>
      At an ethylene content exceeding 60 mole percent, poor gas barrier property will result.
      <br/>
      When the degree of saponification is lower than 90 mole percent, the water resistance and gas barrier property will be unsatisfactory.
      <br/>
      EVOH species having such an ethylene content and such a degree of saponification may be used either singly or two or more of them may be used in combination.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The EVOH (A) may further contain a minor amount of a comonomer or comonomers selected from among  ALPHA -olefins, such as propylene, isobutene,  ALPHA -octene,  ALPHA -dodecene and  ALPHA -octadecene, unsaturated carboxylic acids or salts, partial alkyl esters, complete alkyl esters, nitrites, amides or anhydrides thereof, unsaturated sulfonic acids or salts thereof, vinylsilane compounds, vinyl chloride, styrene and vinyl ethers, for instance.
      <br/>
      It may be "postmodified", for example by derivatization into a urethane, acetalization or cyanoethylation.
    </p>
    <p num="16">&lt;Water content of the hydrous EVOH pellets&gt;</p>
    <p num="17">
      The water content of the hydrous EVOH pellets according to the present invention is set at 5 to 60% by weight, preferably 10 to 50% by weight, more preferably 20 to 40% by weight.
      <br/>
      When the water content is too low, the melting point becomes high, making low-temperature melt extrusion difficult to perform.
      <br/>
      When the water content is excessively high, water back-flow may occur during extrusion molding, making smooth molding difficult to realize.
    </p>
    <p num="18">&lt;Storage elastic modulus of the hydrous EVOH pellets&gt;</p>
    <p num="19">
      It is necessary for the hydrous EVOH pellets of the present invention to have a storage elastic modulus at 20 (degree)  C. of 2 * 106 to 5 * 107 Pa, preferably 3 * 106 to 2 * 107 Pa.
      <br/>
      A storage elastic modulus below 2 * 106 Pa leads to lack of molding stability whereas when it exceeds 5 * 107 Pa, a high torque will result in the step of extrusion processing, making it impossible to achieve the objects of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The "storage elastic modulus" is a value measured upon transmission of vibrations of 10 Hz to the pellets and can be measured using a DMA (dynamic mechanical analyzer).
      <br/>
      In the present specification, the storage elastic modulus is expressed in terms of a measured value at 20 (degree)  C. as obtained during continuous storage elastic modulus measurement with a DMA while raising the temperature of the hydrous EVOH pellets from 10 to 50 (degree)  C. at a rate of 3 (degree)  C./min.
    </p>
    <p num="21">&lt;Hardness of the hydrous EVOH pellets&gt;</p>
    <p num="22">
      While they have the above-mentioned storage elastic modulus, the hydrous EVOH pellets of the present invention preferably have a hardness (measured according to JIS A K 6301, type A spring type hardness testing) at 20 (degree)  C. of 50 to 90, preferably 55 to 85, more preferably 60 to 80.
      <br/>
      This hardness is a characteristic value similar in nature to the above-mentioned storage elastic modulus and, when the hardness is too low, the pellet form tends to become unfavorable.
      <br/>
      When, conversely, the hardness is too high, the extrusion molding at low temperatures tend to become difficult.
      <br/>
      The hardness of the pellets is measured for the cut surface of the pellets as obtained upon cutting the strand-form EVOH to pellets.
    </p>
    <p num="23">&lt;Alcohol (B) containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms&gt;</p>
    <p num="24">
      The hydrous EVOH pellets of the present invention preferably contains a small proportion of an alcohol (B) containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The alcohol (B) containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms includes methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, etc.
      <br/>
      Among these, methanol is most preferred from the industrial viewpoint.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The content of said alcohol (B) is desirably 0.00001 to 0.1% by weight, preferably 0.0001 to 0.05% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 0.05% by weight, relative to the hydrous EVOH pellets.
      <br/>
      The presence of alcohol (B) in such small proportion has a storage elastic modulus-controlling effect on the hydrous pellets and, when the content of alcohol (B) is within the above range, it is easy to obtain the hydrous pellets having a storage elastic modulus within the above range.
      <br/>
      The presence of a small proportion of alcohol (B) is also favorable from the moldability viewpoint, contributing to prevent the molded films from losing their surface smoothness due to formation of streaks on their surface or their surface becoming uneven.
      <br/>
      An excessive content of alcohol (B) should be avoided, however, since it may lead to bubble formation in the molded films.
    </p>
    <p num="26">&lt;Compound (C)&gt;</p>
    <p num="27">
      It is preferred that the above-mentioned hydrous EVOH pellets contain a small proportion of at least one compound (C) selected from the group consisting of a boron compound (c1), acetic acid (c2), an alkali metal acetate (c3), an alkaline earth metal acetate (c4) and a phosphoric acid compound (c5).
      <br/>
      The content of compound (C) is not more than 1 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of EVOH (A) but should correspond to an effective amount.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      More particularly, since said effective amount varies according to the species of compound (C) employed, the content of compound (C) is preferably within the following range.
      <br/>
      Thus, the content of compound (C) per 100 parts by weight of EVOH (A) is preferably:
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      0.001 to 1 part by weight on the boron basis when said compound (C) is a boron compound (c1),
      <br/>
      0.001 to 1 part by weight when said compound (C) is acetic acid (c2),
      <br/>
      0.0001 to 0.1 part by weight when said compound (C) is an alkali metal acetate (c3),
      <br/>
      0.0001 to 0.1 part by weight when said compound (C) is an alkaline earth metal acetate (c4), or
      <br/>
      0.0005 to 0.1 part by weight on the phosphate group basis when said compound (C) is a phosphoric acid compound (c5).
      <br/>
      When two or more compounds (C) belonging to different categories are used, the compound (C) of one category meets the above quantity requirement for said category and the amounts of the other compounds (C) do not exceed the upper limits imposed above on the respective categories.
    </p>

      <br/>
      Among these, boric acid and borax are preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The content of boron compound (c1) on the boron basis is 0.001 to 1 part by weight, preferably 0.001 to 0.8 part by weight, more preferably 0.001 to 0.5 part by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the above-mentioned EVOH (A).
      <br/>
      When its content is too small, the addition of the boron compound may fail to produce the intended effects from the mechanical property or heat stability viewpoint.
      <br/>
      When its content is excessive, the problems of surface roughening and ununiform section of moldings tend to occur, leading to poor moldability.
    </p>

      <br/>
      When the content of alkali metal acetate (c3) is too low, the effects of the invention may not be obtained in certain instances.

    </p>
    <p num="45">&lt;Process for producing the hydrous EVOH pellets&gt;</p>
    <p num="46">The hydrous EVOH pellets can be produced typically in the following manner.</p>
    <p num="47">
      First, a solution of the EVOH (A) in a mixed solvent composed of water and an alcohol is extruded in the form of a strand through a nozzle into a coagulating bath comprising water or a mixed solvent composed of water and an alcohol, and the strand after coagulation is cut to porous pellets containing water and the alcohol in large amounts.
      <br/>
      The hydrous porous pellets are then washed by contacting them with water, and dried to give hydrous pellets.
      <br/>
      In this way, hydrous pellets which have a water content of 5 to 60% by weight and a storage elastic modulus at 20 (degree)  C. of 2 * 106 to 5 * 107 Pa can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      It is important that the hydrous EVOH pellets of the present invention be produced in the wet throughout the production process, namely by coagulating the solution of EVOH (A), contacting the coagulate with water and reducing and adjusting the water content to a specified level by drying, as mentioned above.
      <br/>
      Any process comprising allowing almost water-free EVOH pellets once obtained to contain water, even when the water content is eventually adjusted to 5 to 60% by weight, can hardly give a storage elastic modulus within the range mentioned above and, when the hydrous pellets obtained are subjected to melt molding, the moldability will be insufficient and it is difficult to obtain such high-quality moldings as obtainable according to the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="49">&lt;Method of adjusting the water content and method of incorporation of alcohol (B)&gt;</p>
    <p num="50">
      As the method of adjusting the water content, the method may preferably be employed which comprises mixing EVOH pellets (containing water and methanol) in the production process with water, stirring the resulting mixture and then adjusting the water content by drying.
      <br/>
      When this method is employed, the alcohol (methanol) content can be adjusted simultaneously by utilizing the methanol used in the production of EVOH (A).
    </p>
    <p num="51">Thus, in the process for producing EVOH (A), there are opportunities for contacting with methanol, for example the methanol solvent used in the step of copolymerization of ethylene and vinyl acetate, the methanol vapor used in the subsequent step of residual monomer elimination, the methanol vapor used in the further subsequent step of saponification and the solvent (methanol or a water-methanol mixture) for the saponification catalyst, among others, and, as a result, the EVOH (A) produced contains a large amount of methanol.</p>
    <p num="52">Since the thus-obtained EVOH (A) generally contains about 10 to 70% by weight of water and about 70 to 10% by weight of methanol, this solution of EVOH (A) in the water-alcohol mixed solvent is extruded in the form of a strand through a nozzle into a coagulating bath comprising water or a water-alcohol mixed solvent and, after coagulation, the strand is cut to give porous pellets (in the case of cylindrical pellets, about 2 to 5 mm in length and about 2 to 5 mm in diameter) containing water and alcohol in large amounts.</p>
    <p num="53">
      Then, the hydrous, porous pellets are contacted with water.
      <br/>
      This contacting procedure is performed once or repeated several times, whereby impurity elimination and methanol removal are realized and the water content is adjusted.
      <br/>
      On that occasion, the mixing ratio between the hydrous, porous pellets and water (when the contacting is repeated twice or more, sum total thereof) is preferably about 1/5 to 1/15 by weight, for instance, and the water preferably has a temperature of 20 to 40 (degree)  C. The processing time preferably amounts to about 120 to 240 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Such procedure for contacting with water gives hydrous pellets containing a large amount of water with a reduced methanol content.
      <br/>
      The pellets are then contacted with air or an inert gas (e.g. nitrogen gas) or a water-alcohol mixed vapor at a temperature of not higher than 90 (degree)  C. (preferably 90 to 70 (degree)  C.) to thereby adjust the methanol content in the hydrous pellets to 0.00001 to 0.1% by weight and at the same time adjust the water content to 5 to 60% by weight.
      <br/>
      The contacting of the hydrous pellets with air or an inert gas can be effected by using a box drier, band drier, rotary drier, flash drier or fluidized bed drier, for instance.
    </p>
    <p num="55">&lt;Method of incorporating compound (C)&gt;</p>
    <p num="56">
      The method of incorporating compound (C) is not limited to any particular one provided that a specified amount of compound (C) is eventually contained in the hydrous EVOH pellets.
      <br/>
      The most suited method comprises adding compound (C) to the water to be used in contacting porous pellets with water, or adjusting the amount of compound (C) already present in the system in the step of contacting with water to a specified level.
    </p>
    <p num="57">&lt;Melt molding&gt;</p>
    <p num="58">
      The hydrous EVOH pellets of the present invention are fed to an extruder and melt-molded into moldings.
      <br/>
      The conditions in the molding step are not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      For film production, a nonvent screw-type extruder is generally used and films are produced by extruding at a melt temperature of 40 to 150 (degree)  C., preferably 60 to 140 (degree)  C. For the films produced to retain water with a uniform distribution, it is desirable to use screws affording a compression ratio of 2.0 to 4 0 (slashed zero)
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The hydrous EVOH pellets to be subjected to melt molding may be supplemented with a small amount of a plasticizer, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or glycerol, in an appropriate step during the production of said hydrous pellets or prior to subjecting said hydrous pellets to melt molding.
      <br/>
      A suitable content of such a plasticizer is 0.2 to 10% by weight, for instance.
      <br/>
      An additive or additives selected from among antioxidants, lubricants, hydrotalcites, anti-static agents, colorants, ultraviolet absorbers, inorganic or organic fillers, biocides and the like may be added in amounts which will not be harmful to the effects of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="60">&lt;Drawing&gt;</p>
    <p num="61">
      The moldings in the form of films as obtained in the above manner are subjected to drawing or stretching, as necessary.
      <br/>
      The water content of the moldings in the step of drawing (just prior to drawing) is desirably adjusted to 5 to 50% by weight, preferably 7 to 45% by weight, more preferably 10 to 40% by weight.
      <br/>
      At a water content lower than 5% by weight, there is a tendency toward drawing speck formation, which may cause breakage.
      <br/>
      At a higher water content than 50% by weight, it is difficult to produce the improving effects on the gas barrier property and strength as resulting from sufficient orientation by drawing.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The method of adjusting the water content of the moldings to be subjected to drawing is not limited to any particular one.
      <br/>
      A moisture conditioning procedure may be added immediately following the film production.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The drawing may be uniaxial or biaxial (simultaneous or sequential).
      <br/>
      Since, however, the present invention is particularly effective in the first drawing (in the machine direction (MD)) in sequential biaxial drawing, such drawing is described below in further detail.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The above-mentioned EVOH films with an adjusted water content are first submitted to the step of first drawing (in the direction of MD).

      The first (MD) drawing can be carried out by a conventional method and said films are stretched at a stretching ratio of 1.5 to 8 in the longitudinal direction at a temperature of 30 to 110 (degree)  C., preferably 40 to 100 (degree)  C. It is desirable that the water content after first (MD) drawing be 0.5 to 45% by weight, preferably 1 to 40% by weight.
      <br/>
      When said water content is below 0.5% by weight, there is a tendency toward drawing speck formation in the step of second drawing (in the transverse direction (TD)).
      <br/>
      When said water content exceeds 45% by weight, the effect of orientation in the first drawing cannot be expected and the improving effects on gas barrier property and strength will diminish.
      <br/>
      Adjustment to such water content can be made by adjusting the pre-heating roll temperature and the time of preheating, the temperature and rate of drawing in the first (MD) drawing, for instance.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The EVOH films stretched in the above-mentioned first (MD) drawing are then submitted to the second (TD) drawing for stretching in the transverse direction.
      <br/>
      In such step, any conventional method can be utilized, and the above-mentioned EVOH films are drawn in the transverse direction at a stretching ratio of 1.5 to 8 at a temperature of 60 to 140 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      This second (TD) drawing is generally carried out by the tenter technique with both film edges held with clips.
      <br/>
      Under other conditions than those mentioned above, breakage tends to occur at clipped sites, between clips and/or in the middle of the film transverse direction, making it difficult to obtain the desired oriented films.
    </p>
    <p num="67">&lt;Thermal fixation&gt;</p>
    <p num="68">
      Generally, thermal fixation is further performed following drawing.
      <br/>
      The thermal fixation comprises heating the films in taut condition at a temperature of 120 to 200 (degree)  C. for several seconds to several minutes.
      <br/>
      For providing the films after thermal fixation with flexibility and dimensional stability, the films may be moisture-conditioned to a water content of about 0.3 to 4% by weight, preferably about 0.5 to 3% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="69">&lt;Laminates&gt;</p>
    <p num="70">The EVOH moldings (films) obtained in accordance with the present invention or the stretched products derived therefrom are put to practical use not only as single-layer products but also as laminates at least one layer of which is such EVOH film.</p>
    <p num="71">
      In producing said laminates, the films, sheets or like resin moldings obtained in the above manner are overlaid, on one side or both sides, with another or other substrates.
      <br/>
      The method of lamination comprises, for example, laminating said resin moldings with another or other substrate films or sheets using a known adhesive such as an organotitanium compound, isocyanate compound, polyethyleneimine compound, polyester compound or polyurethane compound.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Said other substrate films are films of an olefin homopolymer or copolymer such as linear low-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, medium-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, an ethylenevinyl acetate copolymer, an ionomer, ethylene-propylene copolymer, an ethylene-acrylic ester copolymer, polypropylene, a propylene- ALPHA -olefin ( ALPHA -olefin containing 4 to 20 carbon atoms) copolymer, polybutene or polypentene, or a polyolefin resin in a broader sense as derived from such olefin homopolymer or copolymer by modification by grafting of an unsaturated carboxylic acid or an ester thereof, a polystyrene resin, a polyester, a polyamide, a copolyamide, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, an acrylic resin, a vinyl ester resin, a polyester elastomer, a polyurethane elastomer, chlorinated polyethylene, chlorinated polypropylene, EVOH or the like.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, paper, metal foils, uniaxially or biaxially oriented plastic films or sheets, woven fabrics, nonwoven fabrics, wooden surfaces and the like may also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="73">When they are film- or sheet-like, the laminates may have not only the bilayer structure X/Y but also arbitrary combinations such as Y/X/Y, X/Y/X, X1 /X2 /Y, X/Y1 /Y2, Y2 /Y1 /X/Y1 /Y2 and so forth, where X (X1, X2, . . . ) stands for an EVOH composition film layer and Y (Y1, Y2, . . . ) for another substrate layer, for example a thermoplastic resin layer.</p>
    <p num="74">&lt;Caldera-like elliptically raised portions&gt;</p>
    <p num="75">
      It is preferred that the above-mentioned stretched moldings have, on their surface, caldera-like elliptically raised portions with a major axis of 10 to 150  MU m and a circumferential height of 0.1 to 3  MU m at a frequence of occurrence of not less than one (preferably 5 to 20) per square millimeter.
      <br/>
      This is because the presence of caldera-like elliptically raised portions having such specific shape and size contributes to preventing the transparency from decreasing on one hand and, on the other, improving the interlaminar adhesion in the production of laminates.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The caldera-like elliptically raised portions refer to elliptical shapes scattered on the stretched film surface and having a convex rim and a concave inside.
      <br/>
      The number and major axis can be determined using a differential interference microscope (e.g. OPTIPHOT-2 produced by Kabushiki Kaisha Nikon), and the shape can be confirmed using a universal surface shape measuring instrument (e.g. MODEL SE-30K produced by Kabushiki Kaisha Kosaka Kenkyusho).
    </p>
    <p num="77">&lt;Applications&gt;</p>
    <p num="78">The thus-obtained EVOH moldings as well as stretched products and laminates derived therefrom are excellent in characteristic features, namely in appearance and gas barrier property, among others, and therefore are very useful in application thereof as films, sheets, tubes, bags, containers and the like for packaging foods, drugs, agrochemical compositions, industrial chemicals and the like.</p>

    <p num="83">Evaluation with respect to various items was made also as mentioned below.</p>
    <p num="84">&lt;Assaying of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals&gt;</p>
    <p num="85">
      About 80 g of a dried sample was accurately weighed, about 10 g thereof was placed in a tared platinum evaporating dish and carbonized on an electric heater.
      <br/>
      The dish was then heated with a gas burner and burned until no smoke was emitted any longer.
      <br/>
      The platinum evaporating dish was then placed in an electric oven maintained at about 400 (degree)  C. and mostly covered with a porcelain lid, and the temperature was raised gradually to 700 (degree)  C. and then maintained at 700 (degree)  C. for 3 hours for complete reduction to ashes.
      <br/>
      To the platinum crucible was added 2 ml of hydrochloric acid (special reagent grade) and 3 ml of pure water, and the residue was dissolved by heating on an electric heater.
      <br/>
      The solution was flushed into a 50-ml volumetric flask with pure water, and pure water was added up to the marked line.
      <br/>
      This solution was used as a sample for atomic absorption spectrometry.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Separately, a standard solution (1 ppm of an alkali or alkaline earth metal, in about 0.5 N hydrochloric acid) was prepared.
      <br/>
      Using this as a control solution, atomic absorption spectrometry was performed and the alkali metal was quantitated based on the absorption ratio.
      <br/>
      The measurement conditions were as follows:
      <br/>
      Apparatus: Hitachi model 180-30 atomic absorption/flame spectrophotometer;
      <br/>
      Flame: Acetylene-air.
    </p>
    <p num="87">&lt;Phosphate radical assay&gt;</p>
    <p num="88">
      The phosphate radical assay was performed by the molybdenum blue (ascorbic acid) technique of spectrophotometry according to JIS K 0120.
      <br/>
      For sample preparation, however, the following procedure was followed:
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      1.
      <br/>
      One gram of the sample weighed exactly is placed in a 300-ml Kjeldahl flask.
      <br/>
      2. About 5 ml of pure water is added, and about 15 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid is added dropwise gradually.
      <br/>
      3. The Kjeldahl flask is heated on a heater, and the water and sulfuric acid are removed just prior to dryness.
      <br/>
      4. After cooling, about 5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid is added, and the mouth of the Kjeldahl flask is covered with a funnel, followed by heating again.
      <br/>
      5. After commencement of white smoke filling the flask, several drops of concentrated nitric acid is gradually added and, once the Kjeldahl flask inside has assumed a brown color due to NOx gas, the dropping of nitric acid is discontinued and heating is continued until substitution with white smoke.
      <br/>
      This dropping of nitric acid under heating is repeated several times.
      <br/>
      6. When the solution in the Kjeldahl flask has become colorless or assumed a transparent yellowish green color, the dropping of nitric acid is discontinued, and the residual nitric acid and water are purged from the solution.
      <br/>
      7. The funnel covering the mouth of the Kjeldahl flask is removed, and the sulfuric acid is purged by igniting until the residue amounts to 2 to 3 ml.
      <br/>
      Note: A separate blank test is performed simultaneously without adding the sample.
