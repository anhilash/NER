    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a novel method for producing a compound of the formula �XVI�  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="3">
      wherein Me is methyl, Bu-t is t-butyl and Ph is phenyl, which is useful as a treatment drug of HIV-related diseases as a result of its inhibitory action on proteases derived from viruses, various novel intermediate compounds useful for producing said compound �XVI�, and to the method for production thereof.
      <br/>
      These intermediate compounds can be used not only for the production of the above-mentioned compound �XVI� but also for the production of various other compounds.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="4">
      The above-mentioned compound �XVI� useful as an HIV protease inhibitor is known as described in W095/09843.
      <br/>
      This compound �XVI� has been conventionally produced from serine as a starting material by increasing carbon and through numerous other steps inclusive of stereoselective reduction of carbonyl group.
      <br/>
      Such conventional production method is extremely complicated and inefficient, since it requires expensive starting materials and constant low temperature conditions for reactions.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there remain many problems to be solved before the conventional synthetic method is actually put to industrial practice.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In addition, 2,2-dimethyl-6-amino-1,3-dioxepan-5-ol which is described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,613 is an intermediate for producing a compound useful as an X ray contrast medium, and even though the compound obtained is a racemate, resolution of the racemate itself by a method such as recrystallization has been extremely difficult.
      <br/>
      Moreover, this US patent does not suggest production of a specific enantiomer of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for stereoselectively and extremely efficiently producing the above-mentioned compound �XVI� useful as an HIV protease inhibitor upon solution of the above-mentioned problems.
      <br/>
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel intermediate compound useful for producing said compound, and a production method thereof.
    </p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
