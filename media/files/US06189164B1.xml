      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to toilets and more specifically it relates to a toilet seat elevating system for assisting a physically challenged individual departing a conventional toilet.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Individuals who are physically challenged, such as an elderly person, often times find it difficult to remove themselves from a conventional toilet after utilization.
      <br/>
      These individuals sometimes injure themselves attempting to remove themselves from the conventional toilets.
      <br/>
      Sometimes they fall from the toilet attempting to remove themselves.
      <br/>
      Hence, there is a need for an invention that assists individuals in leaving a toilet after utilization.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Devices to assist individuals from a toilet have been in use for years.
      <br/>
      Typically, an elongated handle structure is attached to a wall adjacent the toilet for the individual to grasp thereby allowing them to pull themselves up from the toilet.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Unfortunately, some physically challenged individuals do not have the physical strength required to pull themselves from the toilet.
      <br/>
      Also, some bathrooms do not have a wall adjacent the toilet for these handles to attach to.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Examples of attempts to solve the problem of elevating an individual from a toilet include U.S. Pat. No. 4,185,335 to Alvis; U.S. Pat. No. 3,473,174 to Cool; U.S. Pat. No. 5,592,703 to Jones et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,872 to Phillips; U.S. Pat. No. 5,142,709 to McGuire; U.S. Pat. No. 4,993,085 to Gibbons; U.S. Pat. No. 4,833,736 to Sadler et al.; U.S. Pat.

    </p>
    <p num="13">
      While these devices may be suitable for the particular purpose to which they address, they are not as suitable for assisting a physically challenged individual departing a conventional toilet.
      <br/>
      Conventional methods of assisting individuals from a toilet seat require a wall or similar structure adjacent the toilet along with the ability of the individual to pull themselves from the toilet.
      <br/>
      Attempted modifications are not suitable in the respect that they do not provide a simple and affordable structure that can be purchased by the average consumer.
    </p>
    <p num="14">In these respects, the toilet seat elevating system according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of assisting a physically challenged individual departing a conventional toilet.</p>

      The control switch 46 is electrically connected to the control unit 44 for allowing the individual to control the movements of the seat member 50 while sitting upon the seat member 50.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In use, the user removes the seat and lid from the conventional toilet 12.
      <br/>
      The user then removes the rear cross member 24b and positions the frame 20 about the conventional toilet 12 so that the guide funnel 60 is aligned directly above the toilet basin 14 of the conventional toilet 12.
      <br/>
      The user then manipulates the securing members 26 so that the frame 20 of the present invention is attached to the conventional toilet 12 thereby preventing movement during operation and use.
      <br/>
      The user then determines if the arms 30a-b, 32a-b are attached in the desired locations upon the side brackets 52a-b dependent upon the height of the toilet basin 14.
      <br/>
      The user then programs the control unit 44 for the appropriate speed of the actuator 42 and the amount of time the user wants the seat member 50 to remain in an upright position.
      <br/>
      For example, the user may desire to have the seat member 50 stay in an upright position for 10 seconds prior to returning to the lowered position.
      <br/>
      In addition, the user may not want the seat member 50 to automatically return to the lowered position since they may want to utilize the seat member 50 to lower them upon the conventional toilet 12.
      <br/>
      The user then sits upon the seat member 50 and utilizes the conventional toilet 12.
      <br/>
      When finished the user manipulates the control switch 46 so that the actuator 42 extends thereby pivoting the lever structure 40 which elevates the seat member 50 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 4 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      As the seat member 50 is elevated, it is tilted forwardly because the lower arms 32a-b are shorter in length than the upper arms 30a-b as shown in FIG. 4 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      The actuator 42 continues elevating the seat member 50 until in the upright position as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The seat member 50 remains in the upright position until the desired delay time is expended thereafter the actuator 42 lowers the seat member 50 back into the lower position about the conventional toilet 12 as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      It can be appreciated that the user may utilize the present invention to lower themselves upon the conventional toilet 12 and that they may manipulate the control switch 46 to manually return the seat member 50 to the lower position.
      <br/>
      It can be appreciated that the present invention may be utilized by itself as a commode for those confined to a bedroom.
      <br/>
      If utilized as a commode, the present invention would include an attachable backrest that secures to the rear portion of the present invention for supporting an individual's back.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      As to a further discussion of the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="46">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
