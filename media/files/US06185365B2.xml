      A multimedia optical disk is provided.
      <br/>
      The multimedia optical disk includes a data area for storing objects which include moving picture data and at least one of audio data and sub-picture data.
      <br/>
      The multimedia optical disk also includes an index area for storing reproduction orders of the objects.
      <br/>
      Route information in the index area includes a sequence of addresses of objects whose alignment represents a reproduction order.
      <br/>
      Chain control information in the index area corresponds to the route information.
      <br/>
      The chain control information, being effective in reproducing objects specified by the alignment of the sequence of addresses (objects specified by the alignment of the sequence of addresses are called a chain), instructs the reproduction apparatus to have a navigation control of the chain.
      <br/>
      A piece of moving picture data having a certain time period is reproduced at the same timing as a piece of audio data and a piece of sub-picture data.
      <br/>
      A piece of sub-control information, being effective in reproducing moving picture data, sub-picture data, and audio data stored in a small unit instructs the reproduction apparatus to have a navigation control of the data stored in the same small unit.

    <p num="1">This is a divisional application of U.S. Ser. No. 08/700,283, filed on Aug. 20, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,907,658.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to an optical disk which stores information signals recorded with a light beam and to a reproduction apparatus for reproducing such optical disks, more specifically to an optical disk which stores multimedia data including digital moving picture data, audio data, and sub-picture data and to an optical disk reproduction apparatus for reproducing such optical disks.</p>
    <p num="4">(2) Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Of conventional optical disks, compact disks (CDs) and video CDs are representative.
      <br/>
      About an hour of audio digital data can be recorded in a CD, and CDs are used mainly for music software titles.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, video CDs hold about an hour of moving picture digital data including audio digital data, and are used mainly for movie software titles.
      <br/>
      CDs and video CDs are prevalent among many music lovers and movie lovers since they are handy and have good quality of sounds and pictures.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      As a new fashion in the moving picture software, interactive software titles for video CDs are often seen in the market recently.
      <br/>
      The interactive software selectively reproduces a plurality of moving pictures stored in an optical disk according to user instructions and dynamically changes reproduction orders during reproductions.
      <br/>
      An example of such interactive software titles is a multi-story drama in which a story develops according to user selected options.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Now, an optical disk for achieving the interaction and a reproduction apparatus for reproducing the optical disk are described with reference to FIGS. 1A-1C, supposing the optical disk is a video CD.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1A-1C show a video CD.
      <br/>
      The video CD stores a multi-story detective story.
      <br/>
      Note that a multi-story can develop to a plurality of stories.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      FIG. 1B shows how digital data is stored in a video CD.
      <br/>
      The drawing shows five pieces of moving picture digital data, moving pictures -1--5, and a group of pieces of reproduction route data for specifying the reproduction order of the moving pictures are stored in the video CD.
      <br/>
      The digital data sequences making up the moving pictures are stored in the respective consecutive areas in separately.
      <br/>
      Note that all the digital data sequences need not be stored in the consecutive areas.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      FIG. 1A shows the contents of the moving pictures and the reproduction order of them.
      <br/>
      Moving picture -1 shows an image of a detective entering a room.
      <br/>
      Moving picture -2 shows a pen and glasses on a desk in the room.
      <br/>
      Moving picture -3 is a menu providing two option items, item "1" for glasses and item "2" for a pen.
      <br/>
      Moving picture -4 is reproduced when "1" is selected; moving picture -5 when "2" is selected.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      FIG. 1C shows several pieces of reproduction route data.
      <br/>
      The reproduction route data is divided into two types; one provides a reproduction order for a plurality of moving pictures; the other provides a plurality of branch targets.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The former type is called a play list.
      <br/>
      In the play list, a plurality of moving pictures to be reproduced successively and the reproduction order are specified.
      <br/>
      Also, the play list includes a piece of link information which specifies a branch destination of the play list itself, connecting a reproduction route to another.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The latter type is called a selection list.
      <br/>
      The selection list includes a plurality of reproduction routes as branch target candidates and a menu address.
      <br/>
      The menu address is a record address for a menu image that provides a plurality of branch targets.
      <br/>
      The menu image includes a plurality of items whose identification numbers correspond to identifiers of reproduction routes as the branch targets.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In FIG. 1C, reproduction route data -1, -3, and -4 are play lists, and reproduction route data -2 is a selection list.
      <br/>
      The identifiers of the respective items correspond to numeral keys on a remote controller.
      <br/>
      If the user presses any of the numeral keys, a corresponding reproduction route is reproduced.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Now, a reproduction of the video CD shown in FIG. 1B is described.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The reproduction apparatus calculates a record address of the starting reproduction route data of the optical disk by using a certain calculation method.
      <br/>
      On calculating the record address, the reproduction apparatus moves the pickup to a position specified by the address and reads the reproduction route data onto an internal memory.
      <br/>
      Suppose reproduction route data -1, a play list, is read onto a memory.
      <br/>
      Then, the reproduction apparatus determines moving pictures to be reproduced according to the reproduction order indicated by the reproduction route data -1.
      <br/>
      On determining the moving pictures, the reproduction apparatus moves the pickup to a position specified by the record address of the moving pictures and reads the digital data of the moving pictures.
      <br/>
      The reproduction apparatus converts the digital data into picture output signal and audio output signal through a certain signal process, then outputs the signals to the display and speakers.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      After the above processing, the scene of moving picture -1 as shown in FIG. 1A is reproduced for several seconds.
      <br/>
      Moving picture -1 is followed by moving picture -2, the scene of a desk.
      <br/>
      The screen displays a pen and glasses for several seconds.
      <br/>
      When all the moving pictures included in the reproduction route data are reproduced, the reproduction apparatus refers to the link information and reads the next reproduction route data onto a storage through the pickup.
      <br/>
      Then, the reproduction apparatus discards reproduction route -1 and optically reads the next reproduction data onto the internal memory.
      <br/>
      As a result, reproduction route data -2 is read onto a memory, and a menu image providing a plurality of branch targets is displayed.
      <br/>
      Moving picture -3, a menu providing item "1" for glasses and item "2" for a pen, is displayed.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      When the user presses a numeral key on a remote controller corresponding to the identifier of an item in the menu, the reproduction apparatus determines a piece of reproduction route data which is the branch target corresponding to the numeral.
      <br/>
      Then, the reproduction apparatus discards reproduction route -2 and optically reads the determined piece of reproduction data onto the internal memory.
      <br/>
      In the present example, reproduction route data -3 is read onto a memory if the user selects item "1;" reproduction route data -4 if the user selects item "2."
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The reproduction apparatus continues the reproduction according to the new reproduction route data stored in the memory.
      <br/>
      If reproduction route data -3 is stored in the memory, moving picture -4, an image of close-up glasses, is reproduced.
      <br/>
      If reproduction route data -4 is stored in the memory, moving picture -5, an image of close-up pen, is reproduced.
      <br/>
      In this way, the reproduction apparatus continues the reproduction of the moving pictures changing the route according to the selections by the user for the menus.
      <br/>
      It would be understood that a story in the interactive software can develop in various ways, and that the user can enjoy the multi-story feeling as if he/she is the detective appearing on the screen.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The data used for controlling the reproduction proceeding such as the reproduction route data is called navigation control data.
      <br/>
      Recently, the format of the navigation control data and the method the reproduction apparatus uses the data are recognized as very important technical subjects.
      <br/>
      This is because the format determines the capacity of the memory in the reproduction apparatus required for achieving the interactive software.
      <br/>
      The greater is the memory capacity, the more cost is required for the memory, increasing the price of the reproduction apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      CD players and video CD players, being made for private use, generally use memories with the capacity of several-tens KB or under for achieving low costs.
      <br/>
      The above interactive software title causes the reproduction apparatus to have a piece of reproduction route data resident in a memory for reproducing a moving picture.
      <br/>
      The piece of reproduction route data occupies the space of hundreds of bytes in the memory.
      <br/>
      That means the data does not cause a problem to the reproduction apparatus using a memory having capacity of several tens of KB for reproducing the interactive software title.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Software title creators and users desire interactive software titles having more satisfying performances.
      <br/>
      They sometimes talk about the limitation in video CDs for achieving such satisfying performances.
      <br/>
      Now, the functions that cannot be achieved in video CDs and the obstacles to the achievement of such functions are described below.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      First problem is that it is impossible to display options of branch targets to allow the user to selects an option in about 2.0 to 3.0 seconds while an image is displayed on the screen.
      <br/>
      For example, imagine a case where scenes seen from the train window are displayed consecutively on the screen and a set of options are displayed along with a scene of a building such as a castle and a bridge.
      <br/>
      Since a set of options for video CDs are specified for a whole moving pictures, but not for a part of the moving pictures.
      <br/>
      If a software title creator desires to realize a specification for a part of the moving pictures, the software title creator must divide the whole moving pictures into small units and specify the sets of options for the small units.
      <br/>
      However, this arrangement causes the reduction in response.
      <br/>
      That is, the reproduction of the moving pictures is temporarily stopped due to the disk seek for changing the moving pictures and reproduction route data.
      <br/>
      Due to the great compensation, namely, reduction in response, it is virtually impossible for video CDs to realize such reproduction control as changing menu items synchronizing with the moving picture images.
      <br/>
      In other words, it is impossible to have a close correspondence between images and reproduction control.
      <br/>
      For example, in FIG. 1, if a detective meets a suspicious-looking man, a menu asking the user to select an option is displayed according to the change in his face.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Second problem is that the reproduction cannot be controlled by a combination of a past result of the user selection and a current result of the user selection.
      <br/>
      For example, imagine a case of a teaching material where questions are displayed one by one and the points obtained by the user with correct answers are counted up, after all the questions complete, the user is judged as passed the examination if the user's point has exceeded a certain point.
      <br/>
      In video CDs, branch targets cannot be changed according to the past result of the user selection.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is impossible to achieve such an interactive software title as changing the branch target according to the point for a plurality of questions.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Moreover, for a multi-story detective story, unexpected story development and different stories are required so that the user can repeatedly be interested in the story.
      <br/>
      However, if a menu item corresponds to only one story development, the user will soon learn the branch target.
      <br/>
      That is, in the beginning, the user may have an unexpected feeling for the story development, but soon will learn the story development in several repetitions.
      <br/>
      Then, the user will lose interest in the title.
      <br/>
      In the software title of the detective story, if item "glasses" is selected, the control always branches to reproduction route -3.
      <br/>
      It is desired that sometimes the control branches to another route by reflecting the past user selections for the actions of the detective.
      <br/>
      If the selection of item "glasses" always leads to reproduction route -3, the user is accustomed to the story development after playing the interactive software title several times.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="25">It is therefore the first object of the present invention to provide a multimedia optical disk which achieves an interactive software title in which moving pictures are synchronized with instructions to the reproduction apparatus, enabling change of menu items according to the change in a scenery seen from a train window for example, with reduced amount of a memory, and to provide a reproduction apparatus for reproducing such a multimedia optical disk.</p>
    <p num="26">It is the second object of the present invention to provide a multimedia optical disk which achieves an interactive software title in which an instruction is sent to the reproduction apparatus by combining past instructions and present instructions input by the user, enabling a determination of a branch target according to several answers by the user for example, with reduced amount of a memory, and to provide a reproduction apparatus for reproducing such a multimedia optical disk.</p>
    <p num="27">The above objects are achieved by a multimedia optical disk comprising: a data area for storing a plurality of objects each of which includes moving picture data and at least one of audio data and sub-picture data; and an index area for storing a plurality of reproduction orders of at least one object, wherein the index area includes a first index area and a second index area, the first index area storing a plurality of pieces of route information each of which includes a sequence of addresses of objects, wherein an alignment of the sequence of addresses of objects in each of the plurality of pieces of route information represents one of the plurality of reproduction orders, and the second index area storing a plurality of pieces of chain control information which respectively correspond to the plurality of pieces of route information, wherein the plurality of pieces of chain control information, being effective in reproducing objects specified by the alignment of the sequence of addresses (hereinafter objects specified by the alignment of the sequence of addresses are called a chain), instruct a reproduction apparatus to have a navigation control of the chains, and the data area includes a plurality of small areas each of which includes a first sub-area and a second sub-area, wherein each of the plurality of objects is recorded over consecutive small areas, wherein the first sub-area stores at least a piece of moving picture data having a certain time period and at least one of a piece of audio data and a piece of sub-picture data, wherein the piece of audio data and the piece of sub-picture data are reproduced at the same timing as the piece of moving picture data, and the second sub-area stores a piece of sub-control information which, being effective in reproducing data stored in the first sub-area in the same small area, instructs the reproduction apparatus to have a navigation control of the data stored in the first sub-area in the same area.</p>
    <p num="28">
      With the above construction, the sub-control information, being effective in reproducing data stored in the first sub-area in the same small area, instructs the reproduction apparatus to perform a navigation control on the reproduction of the objects.
      <br/>
      This navigation control enables display of branch targets synchronized with displayed images, urging the user to select an branch target in about 2.0 to 3.0 seconds.
      <br/>
      For example, scenes seen from a train window are displayed consecutively on the screen and a set of options are displayed along with a scene of a building such as a castle and a bridge.
      <br/>
      The user can choose a branch target (option) which reproduces introductory images of the castle or the bridge.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The data area includes a plurality of small areas and each object is recorded over consecutive small areas.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a branch does not generate an interruption in moving picture reproduction nor a disk seek.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The reproduction order of each object is specified by the route information.
      <br/>
      The chain control information, being effective in reproducing chains, instructs the reproduction apparatus to have a navigation control of the chains.
      <br/>
      The chain control information enables a determination of a branch target according to several answers to several menus by the user, that is, by combining past selection results and a present selection result.
    </p>
    <p num="31">This enables a software title as a teaching material in which questions are displayed one by one and the points obtained by the user with correct answers are counted up, after all the questions complete, the user is judged as passed the examination if the user's point has exceeded a certain point.</p>
    <p num="32">
      Also, with such a construction, the items and branch targets are not related by one-to-one relation.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is difficult for the user to learn the relation between the items and branch targets.
      <br/>
      This allows the user to enjoy playing the game longer.
    </p>
    <p num="33">The multimedia optical disk may further comprises a plurality of sectors formed on a spiral track, wherein each of the index area and the plurality of small areas is set in a series of consecutive sectors, each of the piece of moving picture data, the piece of audio data, and the piece of sub-picture data in the first sub-area is recorded over at least a sector, and the piece of sub-control information in the second sub-area is recorded over at least a sector.</p>
    <p num="34">
      With such a construction, since each index area and each small area is set in a series of consecutive sectors, data is tightly stored in the sectors.
      <br/>
      This allows the reproduction apparatus to fetch the data without waiting time taken by disk seek and the like.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the reproduction apparatus can fetch the sub-control information every about 0.5 seconds without stopping the image reproduction and control the reproduction according to the information.
    </p>
    <p num="35">In the multimedia optical disk, a pair of a piece of the route information and a piece of the chain control information may be a unit of resident information stored in the reproduction apparatus, and a piece of the sub-control information may be a unit of resident information stored in the reproduction apparatus.</p>
    <p num="36">
      With such a construction, the capacity of the memory of the reproduction apparatus can be reduced.
      <br/>
      This enables creation of interactive software titles which are reproduced by reproduction apparatuses for private use.
      <br/>
      That is, a multimedia software title which makes the most of large capacity of the multimedia optical disk is achieved by the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="37">In the multimedia optical disk, some pieces of the sub-control information may include a flag that prohibits the reproduction apparatus from updating the sub-control information, wherein the reproduction apparatus prohibits a piece of the sub-control information from being stored in the reproduction apparatus as the resident information if the piece of the sub-control information includes the flag.</p>
    <p num="38">
      With such a construction, the reproduction apparatus checks to see whether a menu item has been selected by referring to this flag.
      <br/>
      This enables an update of the sub-control information during a certain time period.
      <br/>
      This also enables an avoidance of a complicated update per VOB unit by recognizing that this flag does not show the necessity of update.
    </p>
    <p num="39">In the multimedia optical disk, the chain control information may include any of a first branch command and a conditional branch command, wherein the first branch command specifies a chain to be reproduced next after a chain corresponding to the chain control information of the first branch command is reproduced, and the conditional branch command specifies a chain which is to be reproduced next after a chain corresponding to the chain control information of the conditional branch command is reproduced and which is determined according to an internal state of the reproduction apparatus, and some pieces of the sub-control information may include any of a second branch command and a change command, wherein the second branch command instructs the reproduction apparatus to branch from a data reproduction of a small area to which the second branch command belongs to a reproduction of another chain, and the change command instructs the reproduction apparatus to change the internal state of the reproduction apparatus.</p>
    <p num="40">
      With such a construction, since some pieces of the sub-control Information includes any of the second branch command and the change command, an interactive branch change and an internal state change are possible.
      <br/>
      Also, since the chain control information includes the conditional branch command, a branch target can be changed according to the internal state changed by the sub-control information.
    </p>

    <p num="67">
      FIG. 2A shows an appearance of the DVD; FIG. 2B a cross-section of the DVD.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2C shows an enlarged circled part of FIG. 2B. Starting from the bottom, DVD 107 is formed of a first transparent substrate 108, an information layer 109, a second transparent substrate 111, a bonding layer 110, and a print layer 112 on which a label is printed.
    </p>
    <p num="68">First transparent substrate 108 and second transparent substrate 111 are both about 0.6 mm thick, that is in a range of about 0.5 mm to 0.7 mm, and are reinforcers of the same material.</p>
    <p num="69">Bonding layer 110, being formed between information layer 109 and transparent substrate 111, bonds these layers.</p>
    <p num="70">
      A reflective membrane such as metal foil is attached to a surface of information layer 109 where it is in contact with transparent substrate 108.
      <br/>
      Indented and protruding pits are formed in this reflective membrane with high density.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      FIG. 2D shows pit shapes.
      <br/>
      The length of a pit ranges from 0.4  MU m to 2.13  MU m. A whole series of pits form a spiral track with a radial distance of 0.74  MU m between the pit lines.
    </p>
    <p num="72">In FIG. 2C, information is retrieved by shining the light beam 113 on the series of pits and measuring changes in the reflection ratio of the light spot 114.</p>
    <p num="73">The light spot 114 on a DVD has a diameter of around 1/1.6 times the diameter of a light spot on a conventional CD due to an increase in the numerical aperture NA of the objective lens and a reduction in the wavelength  LAMBDA  of the light beam.</p>
    <p num="74">
      DVDs of the physical construction described above can store about 4.7 GB of information on one side, which is almost eight times the storage capacity of a conventional CD.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is possible to achieve a great improvement in picture quality for moving pictures and to increase the reproduction time from the 74 minutes which was possible with a video CD to over two hours.

      The substrate technique which has enabled this improvement in storage capacity is a reduction of the spot diameter D of the light beam.
      <br/>
      Here, spot diameter D is given by the equation "D=laser wavelength  LAMBDA /numerical aperture of objective lens NA," so that the spot diameter D can be reduced by reducing the laser wavelength  LAMBDA  and by increasing the numerical aperture of objective lens NA.
      <br/>
      It should be noted here that if the numerical aperture of objective lens NA is increased, comatic aberration occurs due to the relative inclination, known as "tilt", between the optical axis of the beam and the disk surface.
      <br/>
      In order to suppress this phenomenon, DVDs use a transparent substrate of reduced thickness.
      <br/>
      Such a reduction in the thickness of the transparent substrate creates the problem of reduced physical durability for the disk, although this problem can be overcome by reinforcing DVDs with another substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Data is read from DVDs using an optical system with a short wavelength (650 nm) red semiconductor laser and an objective lens whose NA (numerical aperture) is about 0.6 mm. If the thickness of the transparent substrate is about 0.6 mm, a storage capacity of about 4.7 GB can be achieved for one side of a 120 mm diameter optical disk.
      <br/>
      With this large storage capacity, there is more than enough capacity for a whole feature film to be recorded on one disk, with it further being possible for the manufacturer to include soundtracks in several different languages.
      <br/>
      Also, 4.7 GB of storage capacity achieved by this substrate technique is more than enough for a plurality of pieces of moving picture data or audio data.

      As shown in this drawing, the lead-in area, volume area, and lead-out area are included in a track in series, and these areas are recognized by identification information included in the sector address.
      <br/>
      The lead-in area is located at the innermost position of the track; the lead-out area the outermost position.
      <br/>
      The lead-in area stores operation stabilization data which is used when the DVD player starts reading data from the optical disk.
      <br/>
      The lead-out area informs the reproduction apparatus of the end of reproduction and does not store meaningful data.

      The disk reproduction apparatus achieves the disk access in units of files by using the file system management information.
      <br/>
      More specifically, if a file name is given, the disk reproduction apparatus refers to all the system management information to calculate all the groups of logical blocks for the file, and accesses the groups of logical blocks to fetch a desired piece of digital data.

      An example of such a set is a movie application in which two versions of the same movie are included, namely, a theater version and an original cutting version.
      <br/>
      This is because since both versions share many parts of the same movie and can be used in effect when they are managed together as a set.

    <p num="96">
      The video object (VOB) is multimedia data including digital moving pictures, digital sounds, image data, and management data for managing these kinds of data.
      <br/>
      For example, in interactive software title "detective story game," each of VOB-1, VOB-2, VOB-3, . . . shown in FIG. 5 includes a scene of interviewing people concerned, a scene of investigating the spot, and a scene of following a suspect, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      A video object (VOB) includes a plurality of VOB units aligned in time series.
      <br/>
      A VOB unit (VOBU) is a piece of reproduction data with a time period ranging from about 0.5 to 1.0 seconds.
      <br/>
      A VOB unit includes, as shown in FIG. 5, a management information pack and a plurality of packs, namely, video packs, audio packs, and sub-picture packs.
      <br/>
      Each data pack has 2 KB of data.
      <br/>
      By re-constructing these packs, digital data sequences of each video data, audio data, sub-picture data, and control data are generated.
      <br/>
      These digital data sequences re-constructed in types are called elementary streams.
      <br/>
      A VOB is also called a program stream or a system stream each of which includes a plurality of elementary streams.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      In FIGS. 5 and 6A-6D, all data packs are arranged regularly for the sake of explanatory convenience.
      <br/>
      However, since the reproduction apparatus fetches these packs after storing them in buffers, they can be arranged irregularly, except the management information pack which should be placed at the first position.
      <br/>
      Also the total number of packs in a VOB unit and the number of packs for each type may not be the same since moving picture data, audio data, and sub-picture data include variable-length compressed data.
      <br/>
      Actually, each VOB unit has the number of packs different from each other.
      <br/>
      Also, though the VOB unit of the present embodiment has two video packs, a general moving picture includes hundreds of video packs since the rate of about 4.5 Mbits/s is assigned to the moving picture data for transferring the data to the reproduction apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      The video packs stored in the video object (VOB) form at least a piece of digital video data called GOP (Group of Picture).
      <br/>
      GOP is a unit of compressed digital moving picture data after decompression, having about 12 to 15 frames of image data.
      <br/>
      GOP is stipulated under MPEG2 (Moving Pictures Experts Group, IS011172, IS013818).

      The drawing shows, from the top, a moving picture material for a scene, a VOB, three channels of audio materials, and two channels of sub-title materials.
      <br/>
      The downward arrows indicate how moving picture materials are recorded in the data fields of the packs.

    <p num="101">
      As shown in the drawing, a moving picture of about 0.5 seconds from the start is coded into I-pictures (Intra-Pictures), P-pictures (Predictive-Pictures), and B-pictures (Bidirectionally predictive Pictures).
      <br/>
      Then, the pictures are recorded in the data fields of video packs -1 and -2 in VOBU-1.
      <br/>
      Note that though there are hundreds of video packs in reality, it is supposed that there are two packs, as described above.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a moving picture of about 0.5 seconds to 1.0 seconds from the start is coded into I-pictures, P-pictures, and B-pictures.
      <br/>
      Then, the pictures are recorded in the data fields of video packs -3 and -4 in VOBU-2.
      <br/>
      Though it is not shown in the drawing, a moving picture of about 1.0 seconds to 1.5 seconds from the start is coded and recorded in the data fields of video packs in the next VOB unit.
      <br/>
      In this way, a lot of shots such as a realistic action by a stunt man and a marvelous performance by a famous actor are coded into thousands of I-pictures, B-pictures, and P-pictures, then are recorded in the data fields of the video packs in the VOB unit.

      <br/>
      The dubbing of A channel is recorded in the data fields of audio packs A-1, A-2, A-3, . . . Note that since audio data and moving picture data are synchronized with PTS, audio data and moving picture data in the same VOB unit may not necessarily be used at the same time.

      <br/>
      In this case, item information -1 to item information -8 corresponding to the items are the entries.
      <br/>
      Since the field has a fixed length, effective information is not stored for item information corresponding to the items not used. 36 pieces of item information can be set at maximum.
      <br/>
      That means 36 items at maximum can be displayed on the screen at the same time.
    </p>
    <p num="137">Now, the menu used in the reproduction apparatus is outlined before the elements of the Highlight Information are described.</p>
    <p num="138">
      Firstly, the items in a menu are in any of the standard state, selection state, and determination state.
      <br/>
      The state changes with user operations.
      <br/>
      For example, in FIG. 8, the reproduction apparatus displays, for the default operation, item -1 as the selection state and other items as standard state.
      <br/>
      If the standard state is white, selection state blue, determination state red, then, only the item for item -1 is blue.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, the user can check which item is in the selection state (the item in the selection state is also called the item specified by the cursor).
      <br/>
      The user can change the item in the selection state by pressing any of up/down/left/right cursor keys.
      <br/>
      The reproduction apparatus stores information on the cursor destinations for respective up/down/left/right cursor keys, which is later described in detail.
      <br/>
      If the user presses the determination key on the remote controller while the cursor stays at an item in the selection state, the user can determine the item.
      <br/>
      The item turns to red from blue.
      <br/>
      Then, a command specified for the determination state is executed.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 8, the reproduction control is performed for the determined item.

    <p num="140">The highlight general information, as indicated by reference h4 in FIG. 10A, includes a flag indicating a change from the previous VOB unit, a Highlight Information effective section start position, and a Highlight Information effective section end position.</p>
    <p num="141">
      The flag indicating a change from the previous VOB unit has two bits.
      <br/>
      The flag set as "00" indicates that the Highlight Information includes no effective item color information or effective item information; "01" indicates that the present Highlight Information is effective from the present pack, then effective Highlight Information is written in the Highlight Information buffer (described later) in the disk reproduction apparatus; "10" indicates that the Highlight Information interleaved in the preceding VOB unit is also effective in the present VOB unit and that the Highlight Information buffer needs not be overwritten; "11" indicates that the highlight command in the Highlight Information has changed and that only the highlight command is written in the buffer.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      By checking the flag indicating a change from the previous VOB unit, the disk reproduction apparatus determines whether information on the menu items has been changed.
      <br/>
      If the information has been changed, the reproduction apparatus updates the Highlight Information in units of VOB units.
      <br/>
      If the information has not been changed, the reproduction apparatus does not update the Highlight Information.
      <br/>
      This reduces complicated updates in units of VOB units.

      As indicated by reference b6 in FIG. 10B, the item color information includes three types of combinations of the selection color and determination color.
      <br/>
      The selection color is given to an item specified by the cursor; the determination color is given to an item determined by the user.
      <br/>
      Each combination of a selection color and a determination color specifies a color and a mixture ratio for the background color.

      <br/>
      The color pattern number specifies a combination of a selection color and a determination color included in the item color information.
      <br/>
      Start coordinate X1, start coordinate Y1, end coordinate X2, and end coordinate Y2 indicate the range of an area where the specified color and mixture ratio are applied to when an item is selected or determined by the user.

      When any of the cursor keys is pressed, the cursor moves to a position specified in the peripheral position information.
      <br/>
      For example, FIG. 8 shows a menu with eight items aligned in two rows (Example 1 shown below).
      <br/>
      Case 1 below is a piece of peripheral position information that specifies four destinations for four cursor keys when the cursor is currently at item 2; Case 2 when the cursor is currently at item 3. &lt;Example 1&gt;

      Here, if the right cursor key is pressed, the cursor should move to item 3.
      <br/>
      Also, if the left cursor key is pressed, the cursor should move to item 1.
      <br/>
      The peripheral position information specifies these destinations with the item numbers.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      The highlight command field is related to an item information.
      <br/>
      The command written in the highlight command field is executed by the disk reproduction apparatus after the related item is determined by the user.
      <br/>
      The commands that can be written in the highlight command field are divided into SET commands and BRANCH commands.
      <br/>
      Now, the SET commands are described.
      <br/>
      The BRANCH commands are described later.
    </p>
    <p num="163">The SET command instructs the disk reproduction apparatus to substitute a value for a value in a general-purpose register and to perform an operation using the value and an immediate value.</p>
    <p num="164">
      The general-purpose register temporarily stores user's actions or answers.
      <br/>
      For example, in "detective story game," general-purpose registers store user's actions in interviewing people concerned and in investigating a house.
      <br/>
      Also, in "round-the -world quiz," general-purpose registers temporarily store user's answers in certain scenes.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      FIG. 11 shows various SET commands.
      <br/>
      The SET commands are divided into "SetReg" and "Random."
    </p>
    <p num="166">
      As shown in FIG. 11, the set register command "SetReg" includes a register number field, an operation field, and an increment (immediate value) field.
      <br/>
      The register number field specifies any of general-purpose registers R1-R3.
      <br/>
      The operation field specifies any of substitute, addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, MOD operation, AND operation, OR operation, and XOR operation.
      <br/>
      If "substitute" is specified in the operation field and a value is specified in the increment field, a specified general-purpose register is overwritten by the value.
      <br/>
      If "addition" is specified in the operation field and a value is specified in the increment field, the value is added to a specified general-purpose register.
      <br/>
      If "subtraction" is specified in the operation field and a value is specified in the increment field, the value is subtracted from a specified general-purpose register.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      The random number generation command "Random" includes a register number field and an immediate value field.
      <br/>
      The random number generation command selects an integer at random among integers ranging from 1 to a numeral specified in the immediate value field, and substitutes the integer for a value in a general-purpose register specified in the register number field.

    <p num="178">By writing the set register commands as shown above so that each general-purpose register stores a different value, actions taken by the user with the menu of FIG. 8 can temporarily be stored.</p>
    <p num="179">The Highlight Information included in the management information pack which is included in a video object (VOB) as well as the moving picture data, audio data, and sub-picture data, allows the disk reproduction apparatus to perform an addition/subtraction with a value stored in a general-purpose register according to a determination operation by the user.</p>
    <p num="180">The management information pack included in each VOB unit makes it possible for the disk reproduction apparatus to receive and execute an instruction from the user with time accuracy of around 0.5 seconds.</p>
    <p num="181">
      The above response by the disk reproduction apparatus is achieved by the following reasons.
      <br/>
      Since each pack included in a video object (VOB) is 2 KB in size, being equal to the sector size of the optical disk, each video object (VOB) is stored over consecutive sectors without rooms.
      <br/>
      The data stored in the consecutive sectors can be fetched in succession without a waiting time at seek and the like.
      <br/>
      As a result, the disk reproduction apparatus can fetch the management information at every around 0.5 seconds without halting the reproduction of image data and can control the reproduction according to the fetched management information.
    </p>
    <p num="182">The above reproduction control performed with time accuracy of around 0.5 seconds by using the control data for navigation stored in the management information pack is called the reproduction control with GOP level.</p>

      The Video Title Set management information stores information used for managing the plurality of reproduction orders of the above-described video objects (VOBs).
      <br/>
      In DVD, the information specifying a reproduction order of a group of video objects (VOBs) is called a program chain (PGC).
      <br/>
      That is, the Video Title Set storing "detective story game" of the present embodiment has the Video Title Set management information which stores a plurality of program chains specifying the scene developments for "beginner," "intermediate," and "advanced."

    <p num="188">
      The PFC management information table stores, as indicated by reference a6, a plurality of pieces of PGC information -1, -2, -3, -4, . . . -n. Each piece of the PGC information specifies a reproduction order of one or more VOBs.
      <br/>
      It is possible to specify a plurality of reproduction orders by a plurality of pieces of PGC information for the same VOBs.
      <br/>
      For example, for the Video Title Set shown in FIG. 5, suppose a piece of PGC information stores a reproduction order of VOB-1-VOB-2-VOB-3-VOB-4, then, these VOBs are reproduced in the written order.
      <br/>
      Similarly, if a piece of PGC information stores a reproduction order of VOB-3-VOB-2-VOB-l-VOB-4, these VOBs are reproduced in this order. "Detective story game" of the present embodiment has a lot of story developments different from each other.
      <br/>
      This is achieved by preparing a plurality of pieces of PGC information for each story development, using the characteristic that a plurality of reproduction orders can be specified for the same group of VOBs.

      The disk reproduction apparatus determines the next piece of PGC information according to the PGC connection information after it completes the reproduction of a piece of PGC information.
      <br/>
      In this way, the reproduction apparatus continues the reproduction control by changing the PGC information.

      <br/>
      A piece of VOB address information specifies the start and end positions of the corresponding recording section, namely, "START" and "END." The disk reproduction apparatus reads, through the optical pickup, data in the ranges specified in the VOB address information by skipping data in other ranges through the optical pickup.
      <br/>
      As a result, VOBs are reproduced in order of recording sections 101, 102, 103, and 104.

      The pre-processing command start address pointer specifies the start position of the group of pre-processing commands (a11).
      <br/>
      The post-processing command start address pointer specifies the start position of the group of post-processing commands (a12).

    <p num="203">
      The SET commands described before with reference to FIG. 11 can be set as the pre-processing commands or the post-processing commands.
      <br/>
      For example, if the set register commands "SetReg R1,1," "SetReg R2,2," and "SetReg R3,3," respectively specifying immediate values "1," "2," and "3" and general-purpose registers R1, R2, and R3 are written in the pre-processing command field, these commands are executed by the disk reproduction apparatus before VOBs are reproduced according to the PGC information.
      <br/>
      Then, the registers R1, R2, and R3 respectively store different initial values, "1," "2," and "3."
    </p>
    <p num="204">If random number generation command "Random R1,4" specifying immediate value "4" and general-purpose register R1 is written as the pre-processing command, the command instructs the disk reproduction apparatus to generate a random integer number in the range of 1-4 and substitute the number for general-purpose register R1 before VOBs are reproduced according to the PGC information.</p>
    <p num="205">
      The SET commands can also be set as the post-processing commands.
      <br/>
      In this case, the commands are executed after all the VOBs are reproduced according to the PGC information.
    </p>
    <p num="206">
      In "detective story game," the SET commands can be used as flags indicating which scenes have already been seen by the user.
      <br/>
      For example, suppose the game has a certain scene which should be watched at least once by the user in relation to the story development.
      <br/>
      If a pre-processing command in the PGC reproducing the certain scene is a SET command which instructs the disk reproduction apparatus to store a value in a register prepared for a flag, the value is stored in the register each time the scene is reproduced.
      <br/>
      This allows the disk reproduction apparatus to determine whether the user has reproduced the scene.
    </p>
    <p num="207">
      As the post-processing commands, the BRANCH commands are often set as well as the SET commands.
      <br/>
      This is because the BRANCH command as the post-processing command allows the disk reproduction apparatus to branch to a PGC other than a PGC specified as the next PGC in the PGC connection information as a default.
    </p>
    <p num="208">
      FIG. 14 shows various BRANCH commands.
      <br/>
      The command "Link" instructs the disk reproduction apparatus to branch to a program chain having a PGC number specified as an operand in the command.
      <br/>
      If executed, the command "Link" instructs the disk reproduction apparatus to stop reproducing VOBs by the current PGC information and start reproducing VOBs by the PGC information specified in the command "Link." The command "Link" is mainly written as the highlight command and is used to instruct the disk reproduction apparatus to branch to the reproduction corresponding to the menu item selected and determined by the user.
    </p>
    <p num="209">
      Note that when a piece of PGC information is switched to another piece of PGC information by executing a BRANCH command as a highlight command and the like, the post-processing command is not executed.
      <br/>
      This is because all the VOBs specified in the current piece of PGC information have not been reproduced by this time.
    </p>
    <p num="210">The command "SetRegLink" shown in FIG. 14 includes a branch command "Link" and a set register command "SetReg," that is, the command performs an operation such as substitute, addition, and subtraction using a value stored in a register, then allows the disk reproduction apparatus to branch to a program chain specified in the command, as in branch command "Link -n."</p>
    <p num="211">
      The command "SetRegLink" is also mainly used as a highlight command.
      <br/>
      For example, in "detective story game," suppose a menu is displayed urging the user to determine whether to let the detective examine glasses or a pen by selecting a corresponding item in the menu.
      <br/>
      Here, the command "SetRegLink" set as a highlight command instructs the disk reproduction apparatus to store a value in a register prepared for a flag and branch to a scene corresponding to the determined item.
    </p>
    <p num="212">
      The command "CmpRegLink" shown in FIG. 14 is a branch command "Link" specifying certain conditions and includes a register number field, an immediate value field (integer field), a branch condition field, and a branch target field for specifying operands.
      <br/>
      The register number field specifies a general-purpose register.
      <br/>
      The immediate value field specifies a value which is compared with a value of the specified register.
      <br/>
      The branch condition field specifies any of such conditions as "=" (equal), "=" (not equal), "&lt;" (less than), "&gt;" (greater than), " &lt;= " (less than or equal), and " &gt;= " (greater than or equal).
      <br/>
      The command allows the disk reproduction apparatus to judge whether the value stored in a general-purpose register specified in the register number field and the value specified in the immediate value field meet the condition specified in the branch condition field.
      <br/>
      If met, the disk reproduction apparatus changes the PGC information to the one specified and continues the reproduction.
    </p>
    <p num="213">
      If used as the post-processing command, the command "CmpRegLink" can instruct the disk reproduction apparatus to branch to a PGC other than a PGC specified as the next PGC in the PGC connection information as a default.
      <br/>
      For example, in "detective story game, " suppose a flag indicating whether a certain scene has been seen by the user is stored in a register.
      <br/>
      If the flag indicates "no," the disk reproduction apparatus branches to PGC-A, namely, a default destination; if "yes," to PGC-B.
      <br/>
      By using the combination of the flags, the story development can be changed.

    <p num="214">
      The command "PlayTitle" shown in FIG. 14 includes a title number field.
      <br/>
      The title number is an identification number of the title.
      <br/>
      The command "PlayTitle" instructs disk reproduction apparatus to start reproducing the title specified by the title number.
      <br/>
      The command is mainly used for a title menu which urges the user to select a title to be reproduced.

      <br/>
      The character in these images looks sad in "video 198" and "video 201," and looks angry in "video 210," "video 220," and "video 250." The images (menus) of sub-picture packs A-101 and A-125 are respectively superimposed on the images of video packs 201 and 250.
    </p>
    <p num="243">If item "Yes" is selected in both menus of sub-picture packs A-101 and A-125, the set register command "SetReg R1,1,+" is executed twice, then the value stored in general-purpose register R1 is "2."

Then, the command "CmpRegLink R1,2, =,PGC-5" in the post-processing command field is executed and the disk reproduction apparatus judges that general-purpose register R1 has "2" and branches to program chain -5.</p>

      <br/>
      Then, the value stored in general-purpose register R1 is "0." Suppose the reproduction of a series of images as shown in FIG. 18 is completed with the value in register R1 unchanged, and the reproduction control changes from the GOP level shown in FIGS. 19A and 19B to the route level with the PGC information shown in FIG. 17. Then, the first command "CmpRegLink R1,2,=,PGC-5" in the post-processing command field is executed and the disk reproduction apparatus judges that general-purpose register R1 has "0" and branches to program chain -6.

    <p num="245">If item "No" is selected in both menus of sub-picture packs A-101 and A-125, the set register command "SetReg R1,-1,+" is executed twice, then the value stored in general-purpose register R1 is "-2." Then, the third command "Link PGC-7" is executed and the disk reproduction apparatus branches to program chain -7.</p>
    <p num="246">
      As shown above, the responses by the user to the two menus of FIG. 20 can lead to branching to any of three program chains.
      <br/>
      Here, it is supposed that the branch target program chains -5, -6, and -7 respectively correspond to three VOBs, and these VOBs respectively include images as shown in FIG. 21. The three images in FIG. 21 are filmed shots showing three patterns of action of the character.
      <br/>
      That means, one of these images in FIG. 21 is displayed.
      <br/>
      This is the result of the responses to the two menus by the user and the multi-branch by the post-processing as described before.
      <br/>
      Seeing the change in the action of the character, the user would feel his/her responses to the questions in two menus have influenced and changed the character.
    </p>
    <p num="247">
      Furthermore, the two menus are respectively synchronized with the changes in the face of the character as shown in FIG. 20 with time accuracy of around 0.5 seconds and are displayed for a necessary time period.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, being required to determine the action of the character in real time, the user enjoys the virtual reality of feeling as if he/she is the character itself.
    </p>
    <p num="248">
      Now, FIGS. 20 and 21 are explained from the viewpoint of the story development.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 20, the expression of the character in "video 198" and "video 201" gives one an impression that the character has an important clue to the case.
      <br/>
      By superimposing the menu of sub-picture pack A-101 on "video 201," the title urges the user to determine whether to ask the character to say the truth.
    </p>
    <p num="249">
      The character suddenly changes her attitude in "video 210" to "video 250." The character gets upset and protests against the character (user) in the menu of sub-picture A-125.
      <br/>
      By superimposing this menu on "video 250," the title intends to check the positiveness of the user in coming at the truth.
    </p>
    <p num="250">
      If the user selects "Yes" in both menus in FIG. 20, it means that the user is positive in solving the problem.
      <br/>
      After "Yes" is determined in the second menu, the disk reproduction apparatus branches to program chain 5 by the post-processing of program chain 3 and the upper image in FIG. 21 is displayed.
      <br/>
      The upper image indicates that the character, convinced by the positiveness of the character (user), begins to talk about the facts she knows.
    </p>
    <p num="251">
      If the user selects "No" in both menus in FIG. 20, it means that the user is negative in solving the problem.
      <br/>
      After "No" is determined in the second menu, the disk reproduction apparatus branches to program chain 7 by the post-processing of program chain 3 and the lower image in FIG. 21 is displayed.
      <br/>
      The lower image indicates that the character, amazed at the negativeness of the character (user), starts leaving the place.
    </p>
    <p num="252">
      If the user selects "Yes" in the first menu and "No" in the second menu, or vice versa, in FIG. 20, it means that the user is indefinite in solving the problem.
      <br/>
      After an item is determined in the second menu, the disk reproduction apparatus branches to program chain 6 by the post-processing of program chain 3 and the middle image in FIG. 21 is displayed.
      <br/>
      The middle image indicates that the character, looking at the ambiguous attitude of the character (user), begins to distrust him.
    </p>
    <p num="253">Now, the use of the highlight command field and the post-processing in branching is considered in comparison.</p>
    <p num="254">
      In Application Example 1, the set register command "SetReg" written in management information packs P101 and P125 sets a value in a general-purpose register, and the post-processing instructs the disk reproduction apparatus to branch to a specified program chain.
      <br/>
      However, by setting the BRANCH commands in the highlight command fields of VOBU-101 and setting corresponding items as described below in Application Example 2, the disk reproduction apparatus can branch from "video 201" to any of three program chains shown in FIG. 21.
    </p>
    <p num="255">Application Example 2</p>
    <p num="256">item 1 . . . "keep asking the question"</p>
    <p num="257">item 2 . . . "stop asking the question"</p>
    <p num="258">item 3 . . . "difficult to decide"</p>
    <p num="259">highlight command field of item information -1 . . . Link PGC-5</p>
    <p num="260">highlight command field of item information -2 . . . Link PGC-6</p>
    <p num="261">highlight command field of item information -3 . . . Link PGC-7</p>
    <p num="262">
      When the commands set as above are executed, "video 201" switches to any of the images shown in FIG. 21. This change may be quick but may be too quick.
      <br/>
      This makes a sharp contrast to Application Example 1.
      <br/>
      In application Example 1,the change in the action and face of the character is regarded as important, and the current scene changes after all the images in the scene have been reproduced.
      <br/>
      As a result, if the title creator does not want a sudden change in scene development with program chains, he/she can temporarily store actions taken in a scene in a general-purpose register and allow the disk reproduction apparatus to branch to another program chain by the post-processing according to the value stored in the general-purpose register.
    </p>
    <p num="263">
      On the other hand, if the title creator wants to surprise the user by changing scenes quickly, he/she can allow the disk reproduction apparatus to branch to another program chain as soon as the user selects an option in a menu.
      <br/>
      Watching a scene totally different from the previous scene, the user is expected to be astonished.
    </p>
    <p num="264">
      Note that branching with the use of highlight commands means that an item selecting operation always leads to one kind of branching, namely, one-to-one relation.
      <br/>
      Though the user may be surprised at the sudden scene changes at first, soon he/she will be accustomed to the branches.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is desired to mix the branching with highlight commands and the branching with the post-processing.
      <br/>
      However, in branching to the PGC information as in selecting a course from a menu, branching with the highlight commands is desirable because the speed is important.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, if the title creator intends to show each scene fully to the user, as in a dramatic scene development, it is desirable to insert a menu at every two to three seconds, as in Application example 1, and accumulate the responses to the menus and branch to another scene at the end of the current scene according to the accumulated values.

    <p num="265">(1.1.2) Logical Construction . . . Video Manager</p>
    <p num="266">
      The Video Manager includes video objects (VOB) and the program chain management information, and the construction is almost the same as that of the Video Title Set.
      <br/>
      The VOB of the Video Manager differs from that of the Video Title Set in that the Video Manager is specialized in the volume menu.
      <br/>
      The volume menu provides a list of all the titles included in the optical disk so that the user can select one from the list.
      <br/>
      The volume menu is displayed on the screen after an optical disk is loaded in the disk reproduction apparatus and the optical pickup moves from the volume management area to the volume area.
    </p>
    <p num="267">
      There are following differences between the Video Manager and the Video Title Set.
      <br/>
      First, while the VOB of the Video Title Set includes video packs, audio packs, sub-picture packs, and a management information pack as shown in FIG. 6, the VOB of the Video Manager includes the same kinds of packs for a menu.
      <br/>
      Secondly, while the BRANCH commands written in the PGC information and the Highlight Information of the Video Title Set specify branch targets which do not exceed the Video Title Set itself, the BRANCH commands of the Video Manager can specify any of a plurality of titles included in a plurality of Video Title Sets as a branch target.
      <br/>
      FIG. 32 shows the construction of the Video Manager.
      <br/>
      As shown in the drawing, the Video Manager includes menu program chain management information, a title search pointer table, and a menu video object.
    </p>
    <p num="268">
      The menu video object is a VOB specialized in the volume menu.
      <br/>
      That is, the menu video object includes a sub-picture pack for the volume menu and a management information pack which controls the reproduction according to the selection and determination operations by the user.
      <br/>
      FIG. 33 is the volume menu displayed on the screen.
      <br/>
      The menu video object includes a plurality of items.
      <br/>
      The items represent titles such as "beginner" and "intermediate" of "detective story game." A title is specified when the user determines an item in the menu.
      <br/>
      The management information pack in the VOB includes as many pieces of Highlight Information as the titles in the optical disk as shown in FIG. 33. The highlight command field of each piece of Highlight Information includes the command "TitlePlay" specifying a Video Title Set or a title as the branch target.
    </p>
    <p num="269">
      The menu program chain management information is PGC information specialized in the volume menu.
      <br/>
      The menu program chain management information stores a recording section of the menu video object which is first read by the disk reproduction apparatus.
      <br/>
      The menu program chain management information is read by the disk reproduction apparatus after an optical disk is loaded in the disk reproduction apparatus and the optical pickup moves from the volume management area to the volume area.
      <br/>
      Then, the volume menu is displayed on the screen.

      <br/>
      The disk rotation is stabilized while optical pickup 82 is placed in the lead-in area.

      In Operation Example 3, it is supposed that the user selects "world course" of "round-the-world quiz" in the volume menu as shown in FIG. 33. The construction of Video Title Set "round-the-world quiz" is shown in FIGS. 34A, 34B, and 34C.
      <br/>
      Also, the connection of the program chains and the VOBs in "world course" of "round-the-world quiz" are shown in FIG. 37. Operation Example 3 is described below with reference to these drawings.
    </p>
    <p num="395">
      As indicated by reference c136 in FIG. 34A, "world course" of "round-the-world quiz" is reproduced according to PGC information -A3--A8.
      <br/>
      PGC information -A3 for reproducing an imagd representing "not passed" and -A4 for "passed" are exclusively executed according to the points the user obtains through the quiz, as in Operation Example 2.
    </p>
    <p num="396">
      Each of PGC information -A6--A8 includes a combination of three VOBs picked up from VOB-A1-VOB-A20, the combination being different from each other.
      <br/>
      The VOBs are questions given to the user.
      <br/>
      Also, each of PGC information -A6--A8 includes the same PGC connection information, post-processing commands, and pre-processing commands as PGC information -A1 explained in Operation Example 2, except for the VOBs stored in each PGC information.
    </p>
    <p num="397">
      PGC information -A5 is executed first as the title is reproduced, and determines any of PGC information -A6--A8 at random.
      <br/>
      FIG. 34C shows the contents of PGC information -A5.
      <br/>
      As shown in the drawing, PGC information -A5 stores command "Random R2,3" as a pre-processing command and also stores commands "CmpRegLink R2,2,=,PGC-A7" and "CmpRegLink R2,1,=,PGC-A8" as post-processing commands.
      <br/>
      The PGC connection information specifies PGC information -A6.

    <p num="398">(2.3.4.1) Operation Example 3 . . . Pre-Processing</p>
    <p num="399">
      At step 131, embedded processor 96 fetches a pre-pre-processing command by referring to the pre-processing command start address pointer and decodes the operation code.
      <br/>
      Since the operation code is "Random," embedded processor 96 fetches immediate value "3" from the immediate value field.
      <br/>
      Then, a number is generated among the random numbers of maximum "3." The generated number is stored in general-purpose register R1 specified by identifier "R1" stored in the register identifier field.
      <br/>
      Then, control moves to steps 132-139 in FIG. 28.
    </p>
    <p num="400">(2.3.4.2) Operation Example 3 . . . Post-Processing</p>
    <p num="401">
      At steps 140-141, a branch target is selected from three branch targets since general-purpose register R1 stores any of random numbers generated by a "Random" command.
      <br/>
      That means, control branches to any of PGC information -A6, -A7, and -A8 at random.
      <br/>
      The VOBs specified by the program chains are reproduced sequentially.
      <br/>
      The points acquired by the user by answering the questions correctly are accumulated in register R1.
      <br/>
      When the reproduction of the program chains completes, the disk reproduction apparatus branches to PGC-A3 if the user is passed and to PGC-A4 if not passed.
    </p>
    <p num="402">(2.3.5) Operation Example 4</p>
    <p num="403">
      Operation Example 4 is an application to Operation Example 3.
      <br/>
      In Operation Example 3, a next program chain is selected using a random number.
      <br/>
      Now, it is also possible to determine a next program chain by combining a random number and the selection of an item by the user.
      <br/>
      This is described below.
    </p>
    <p num="404">
      Suppose the points obtained by the user for the questions of PGC information -A1 are stored in register R1.
      <br/>
      Also suppose one of ten pieces of PGC information -101--110 is selected as the next branch target according to the points.
      <br/>
      The ten pieces of PGC information are graded based on the difficulty of the questions (PGC information -101 for the easiest end PGC information -110 for the most difficult).
      <br/>
      PGC information -B100 is used to select a program chain among the above pieces of PGC information.
      <br/>
      PGC information -100 stores the following post-processing commands:
    </p>
    <p num="405">CmpRegLink R1,10,&lt;,PGC-100</p>
    <p num="406">SetReg R1,10,-</p>

    <p num="409">Link R2,</p>
    <p num="410">where the value as the points stored in register R1 ranges from "0" to "20."</p>
    <p num="411">
      If the user acquires point "9" or less, namely, a bad result, the disk reproduction apparatus branches to PGC information -101.
      <br/>
      For point "10" or more, a result of the point minus "10" becomes a base for generating a random number. "100" is added to the generated random number, and the result is converted into an identification code.
      <br/>
      The disk reproduction apparatus branches to a piece of PGC information specified by the identification code.
      <br/>
      That is, if the user obtains a good result in a current piece of PGC information (in this case, -A1), the next program chain is selected among a variety of higher ranks in the difficulty of the questions; if a bad result, among a variety of lower ranks.
    </p>
    <p num="412">As understood from the above description of the present embodiment, the Highlight Information set in a video object per GOP makes it possible for the disk reproduction apparatus to receive fan instruction from the user with time accuracy of around 0.5 to 1.0 seconds synchronizing with the images and without halting the reproduction of the moving pictures.</p>
    <p num="413">Furthermore, a piece of PGC information that manages a plurality of video objects and the reproduction order as the reproduction route makes it possible for the disk reproduction apparatus to achieve a reproduction control in which a next group of consecutively reproduced moving pictures and the reproduction order are determined by evaluating the user instructions having been received.</p>
    <p num="414">In other words, a variety of interactive reproductions are achieved by the reproduction control of two levels, namely, the reproduction control with GOP level which synchronizes with the images and the reproduction control with route level which is performed independent of the images.</p>
    <p num="415">The reproduction control with two levels, or GOP level and route level, also enables the reduction in memory usage at the reproduction control, which is performed together with the image reproduction, to the memory usage for a piece of PGC information and a piece of Highlight Information, reducing the memory capacity required for the disk reproduction apparatus.</p>
    <p num="416">
      In the present embodiment, the VOB address information table of the PGC information includes a plurality of pieces of VOB address information specifying VOB recording sections to be used by the disk reproduction apparatus for reading VOBs.
      <br/>
      However, the VOB address information may specify a part of the VOB recording section so that the optical pickup can read the part of the VOB.
      <br/>
      Such a partial reading is called trimming.
      <br/>
      The part of a VOB fetched through trimming is operated in units of cells.
      <br/>
      The specification of a part of the VOB recording section in the VOB address information increases the use efficiency of image materials since a part of VOB can be used effectively.
    </p>
    <p num="417">
      In the present embodiment, the sub-picture data includes the image data of subtitles. however, the sub-picture data may include vector graphics or three dimensional computer graphics (CG).
      <br/>
      With such arrangements, games in which compressed moving pictures of filmed shots and CG are mixed may be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="418">
      In the present embodiment, a VOB unit consists of a GOP.
      <br/>
      It is needless to say that if the stored moving pictures have a reproduction time of about a second, a VOB unit may consist of two or three GOPs with very short reproduction time.
      <br/>
      In this case, a management information pack is set before such a plurality of consecutive GOPs.
      <br/>
      The management information pack is effective for the plurality of GOPs.
    </p>
    <p num="419">
      In the present embodiment, the items in menus are reproduced with the sub-picture data.
      <br/>
      This is because with this arrangement, the change of the cursor is indicated by the change in color or contrast.
      <br/>
      However, the items may be reproduced with the moving picture data or may be replaced by narrations if such a change is not required.

    <p num="420">
      In the present embodiment, the PCM data and the AC-3 data are used for the audio data.
      <br/>
      However, other kinds of audio data such as compressed PCM data, MPEG audio data, and MIDI data may be used as far as the data can be interleaved in the system stream.
    </p>
    <p num="421">
      In the present embodiment, the digital moving picture data under MPEG2 is used for the moving picture data.
      <br/>
      However, other kinds of moving picture data such as the digital moving picture data under MPEG1 and the digital moving picture data with a conversion algorithm other than DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) under MPEG may be used as far as the moving picture data can form the multimedia data with the audio data and the sub-picture data.
    </p>
    <p num="422">
      In the present embodiment, the management information packs are included in VOBUs in units of GOPs, being the units of reproducing moving picture data.
      <br/>
      However, it is needless to say that if the method for compressing digital moving pictures changes, the unit of the management information pack changes according to the compression method.
    </p>
    <p num="423">
      In the present embodiment, the Highlight Information is stored in the same storage area with the control information for the trick-plays such as forward bind.
      <br/>
      The management information pack including the Highlight Information is allocated in units of GOPs.
      <br/>
      This is because the control information for trick-plays should be allocated per unit of reproducing moving picture data.
      <br/>
      However, the management information pack including the Highlight Information may be allocated in the units other than GOPs if the Highlight Information is not stored in the same storage area with the control information for the trick-plays.
      <br/>
      For example, the management information pack may be synchronized with an image frame reproduced per a thirtieth second, being far less than 0.5 to 1.0 seconds.
    </p>
    <p num="424">
      In the present embodiment, a read-only DVD is used.

    <p num="425">
      In the present embodiment, an item is selected and determined by using ten keys on remote controller 91.
      <br/>
      However, the means may be replaced by the use of mouse or instruction by voice.
    </p>
    <p num="426">
      The commands included in the management information packs may be executed automatically independent of user operations.
      <br/>
      This will enable the reproduction control in units of smaller time units.
    </p>
    <p num="427">
      In the present embodiment, the pre-processing and post-processing commands stored in the PGC information are�executed in the route level.
      <br/>
      However, commands may be executed before or after a VOB in a program chain is reproduced.
      <br/>
      For example, with such an arrangement, a register may be cleared after a VOB is reproduced.
    </p>
    <p num="428">
      In the present embodiment, the PGC information, which is the reproduction control information used in the route level, and video objects are stored in different disk areas.
      <br/>
      However, the PGC information may be stored in the video objects themselves.
      <br/>
      For example, if another management information pack (hereinafter second management information pack) including the branch target program chains is interleaved in an image reproduction section which generates a branch, the disk reproduction apparatus branches to any of the program chains.
      <br/>
      With such arrangements, the disk reproduction apparatus can obtain necessary PGC information from the video object itself without disk seek, deleting the waiting time of the user in changing the reproduction route.
      <br/>
      This is described in detail with reference to FIG. 34A. The disk reproduction apparatus is supposed to branch to another program chain when the reproduction with PGC information -A1 is completed, that is, when the reproduction of the last VOB specified in PGC information -A1, namely, VOB-A6, is completed.
      <br/>
      The branch target here is any of PGC-A3 and PGC-A4.
      <br/>
      If the second management information pack is interleaved in the last VOB unit of VOB-A6, the disk reproduction apparatus obtains candidates for the branch target PGC information immediately before the branch and branches to a program chain without disk seek.
      <br/>
      For such a performance, the disk reproduction apparatus should have another buffer like the Highlight Information buffer for temporarily storing the candidates for branch target PGC information
    </p>
    <p num="429">
      In the present embodiment, a random number is used as a dynamic parameter to specify a branch target of the reproduction.
      <br/>
      However, the dynamic parameter may be specified by another means such as the use of a timer.
      <br/>
      Also, a command may be introduced to instruct the disk reproduction apparatus to branch to a program chain when a timer interrupt is input.
      <br/>
      Such a command enables an interactive software title which gives questions to the user and rejects him/her if the he/she cannot answer by a time limit.
      <br/>
      Such an application may be effective as a teaching material.
    </p>
    <p num="430">
      Now a method for producing an optical disk used in the present embodiment is described.
      <br/>
      The editor has to prepare master tapes such as video tapes of various shots filmed with video cameras and music tapes in which songs and sounds are recorded live.
      <br/>
      The moving pictures and sounds in the tapes are digitized and loaded into a nonlinear editing machine.
      <br/>
      The editor creates menus and items using application programs such as a graphic editor loaded in the editing machine, reproducing pictures and sounds frame by frame.
      <br/>
      The editor also creates management information packs having highlight commands by using a GUI generator and the like.
      <br/>
      Then., the editor encodes the above data under MPEG to create moving picture data, audio data, sub-picture data, and management information pack.
      <br/>
      Then, the editor creates the VOB unit and VOBs by using the nonlinear editing machine.
      <br/>
      T he editor assigns numbers to the VOBs.
      <br/>
      A1 so, the editor creates PGC information -1, -2, -3, . . . , -n, video file unit title search pointer table, and video file management table.
      <br/>
      The editor loads these pieces of data into a memory, in a workstation.
    </p>
    <p num="431">
      The data is converted into logical data sequences so th at the data is recorded in the file area.
      <br/>
      The logical data sequences are recorded into a medium such as the magnetic tape, then converted to physical data sequences.
      <br/>
      The physical data sequences include volume data with ECC (Error Check Code), E-F conversion, data in the lead-in area and lead-out area.
      <br/>
      A master optical disk is produced by using the physical data sequences.
      <br/>
      Then, copies of the master optical disk are manufactured by using a pressing machine.
