    <heading>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention generally relates to methods and apparatus for operating a cycle such as a bicycle.</p>
    <p num="2">
      In recent years including the present, bicycling and other cycling whether for entertainment, sport or exercise has greatly increased in popularity.
      <br/>
      This has spawned many inventions and developments in this field primarily aimed at increasing performance of the cycle.
      <br/>
      These innovations for the most part have concentrated on the cycle itself for example by improving the operation of the various parts and also decreasing the overall weight of the cycle by using lightweight materials.
      <br/>
      In contrast to the latter areas of invention and development, the present invention takes an entirely novel approach by focusing on the performance of the cyclist rather than the cycle itself.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Accordingly one of the objects of the present invention is to provide a novel and improved method and device for increasing the performance of a cyclist during bicycling or other cycling.
      <br/>
      Included herein is the provision of such method and device for increasing the speed performance obtainable by the cyclist for a given cycle or bicycle.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel method and device for generating energy for transfer to the legs of a cyclist to increase performance of the cyclist in rotating the pedals and sprocket of the cycle.
      <br/>
      Included herein is the provision of such method and device which maybe used to increase the speed of operation of a cycle for a given cyclist and a given cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A further object of the present invention is to provide novel method and apparatus as described above that may be applied to virtually any cyclist for increasing the cyclist's performance and speed on a cycle.
      <br/>
      Included herein is the provision of such method and apparatus that can be utilized to decrease the imbalance that may exist between the hamstring and quadriceps muscles of a cyclist thereby increasing the performance of the cyclist.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A still further object of the present invention is to provide a novel device or apparatus that may be worn by the cyclist to increase the cyclist's performance of a bicycle or other cycle.
      <br/>
      Including herein is such a device that generates energy from the movement of the cyclist's legs and releases the energy into the cyclist's legs for increasing performance of the cyclist.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention includes method and device for operating a cycle of the type having a sprocket and pedals connected to the sprocket for rotating the sprocket on downstrokes and upstrokes of the pedals.
      <br/>
      The invention includes a provision of one or more elastic members applied to the legs of the cyclist such that the elastic members will stretch on the downstroke of the pedals to generate energy and contract on the upstroke of the pedals to release the energy for assisting the cyclist's legs to rotate the pedals and in turn the sprocket.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, energy members are also worn on the foot-ankle area of the cyclist such that they will stretch when the foot points generally downwardly to generate energy and contract when the foot returns to a horizontal or upward position to transfer the energy into the feet for assisting the rotation of the pedals together with the energy members worn on the cyclist's legs.

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      Referring now to the drawings in detail there is shown for illustrative purposes only methods and apparatus constituting preferred embodiments of the present invention for assisting the leg muscles during cycling.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows a cyclist on a bicycle including a sprocket 30 having arms 32 connected to pedals 34.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the method of the present invention, the cyclist wears on his leg, preferably both legs, a member referred to herein as an "energy member" which will be stretched or extended during pedaling on the downstroke when one leg is extended such as L shown in FIG. 3 while the other leg L' is raised to raise the pedal during the upstroke of that pedal.
      <br/>
      When the energy member is extended it generates energy for assisting the leg muscles and particularly the hamstring muscles upon raising the leg during the upstroke when the leg raises the pedal preferably through a connection between the foot and the pedal such as maybe obtained through conventional cyclist's shoes 3 which have a cleat or lug 4 projecting from the bottom of the cyclist's shoe for receipt in a receptacle fixed to the pedal 34 as best shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      During the upstroke of the pedal, the energy previously generated on the downstroke in the energy member is released and transmitted to the leg to assist the upstroke.
      <br/>
      This will result in increased performance of the cyclist and in turn increased speed of the cycle.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that two energy members one for each leg be used.
      <br/>
      The energy members may be attached to the legs above and below the knees in any suitable manner so that they will be stretched on the downstroke to generate energy and contracted on the upstroke to release and transfer the energy to the legs.
      <br/>
      The energy members may take any suitable form or construction such as an elongated elastic strap or member or even an elongated coil spring.
      <br/>
      In addition the energy members may be incorporated in the legs of a pair of cyclist's tights or pants which have bottom straps which go around the bottoms of the feet while the tights on pants are secured to the body at the waist so that upon the downstroke the pants leg will be stretched to store energy and upon the upstroke will contract to release the energy into the legs.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Referring to FIGS. 1 through 4, one preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes an elastic strap for the energy member generally designated 10 in the drawings.
      <br/>
      Any suitable elastic material may be used to form the strap.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the energy member 10 should have a construction so as to be able to generate a tension force of about three to twelve pounds (3 to 12 lbs.) depending on the strength of the cyclist upon extension of the leg during the downstroke.
      <br/>
      An optimum force of approximately six pounds (6 lbs.) of tension is preferred for average sizes and strengths of cyclists.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment of the present invention the energy member includes two lower straps or members 16 and 18 and a single upper member 14 as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The upper member 14 is attached to any suitable location on the body such as in the preferred embodiment about the waist by means of a waist member, band or belt 12.
      <br/>
      The bottom of the energy member in the preferred embodiment is attached to the feet by extending the strap about the bottom of the feet as shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In the preferred embodiment a single elastic strap 10 may be employed with the upper end of the strap passing about the waist band 12 and extending downwardly through an adjustment buckle 22, about the outside of the calf of the leg at 16, about the bottom of the foot and then about the inside of the calf at 18 and terminating in an end passing through the buckle 22.
      <br/>
      Lower energy members 16 and 18 may be adjusted through the buckle 22 while the upper energy member 14 may be adjusted through buckle 24 so that the length of the energy members may be adjusted to suit the particular length of the cyclist's legs.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the preferred embodiment, an ankle band shown at 20 is provided to interconnect the lower energy members 16 and 18 to help secure and balance them in place on the opposite sides of the cyclist's calf.
      <br/>
      Ankle band 20 may be made from any suitable material which is attached by sewing or otherwise to lower portions of the energy members 16 and 18 as shown in the drawings.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In use of the energy members 10 of the present invention it is preferred that each of the legs be provided with them as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      During the downstroke of each leg such as shown for example by the left leg in FIG. 3, the energy members 16 and 18 will stretch and store energy in the range of 3 to 12 pounds and preferably 6 pounds whereupon during the upstroke of the leg shown in FIG. 4 the energy will be transferred to the legs for helping the hamstring and other muscles during the upstroke.
      <br/>
      Not only do the energy members provide extra energy and force on the upstroke of the pedals but they also help to bring the quadriceps and hamstring muscles closer into balance in cases where the quadriceps muscles are abnormally stronger than the hamstring muscles in a particular cyclist.
      <br/>
      The energy members are particularly useful for cyclists whose hamstring muscles have abnormally less strength than the quadriceps muscles bringing the two out of balance.
      <br/>
      The overall result of the energy members of the present invention is that the cyclist is able to increase the efficiency and speed of pedaling to increase the speed of the sprocket and in turn the bicycle.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, additional transfer of energy to the legs and feet for rotating the sprocket with greater speed and efficiency is achieved through the use of energy members worn on the feet.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment shown in FIGS. 5 through 8, the energy member takes the form of an elastic strap generally designated 40 best shown in FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The foot member 40 has a forward end generally designated 44 defining a loop for receiving the front of the cyclist's foot.
      <br/>
      The opposite end of the foot member 40 has two free ends 41 and 43 adapted to be fastened together about the rear of the ankle area of the cyclist to mount the foot member 40 on the foot-ankle area.
      <br/>
      Any suitable fastener may be employed such as VELCRO material 46 for fastening the ends 41 and 43 about the rear of the foot as best shown at 42 in FIGS. 5 and 6.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Referring now to FIG. 8, it illustrates that the foot member 40 in addition to being mounted with its front loop around the foot or the toes of the cyclist, may also be mounted around the front end of the cyclist's shoe generally designated 50 in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the energy member 40 for the foot-ankle area may be made from any suitable elastic, plastic or cloth or other fabric that is of course stretchable to generate and release energy.
      <br/>
      In the specific embodiment shown if FIG. 7, the energy member 40 is constructed by two intersecting strap areas at the forward end which are sewn or otherwise fastened together at the area 49 shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      The energy member 40 may of course be made in any other suitable manner.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment the energy member is made of material and dimensions that when the cyclist points his foot downwardly during pedaling the energy member 40 will be stretched to a degree generating a tension force of approximately 2 to 4 pounds which will be transferred to the foot when the foot returns to the horizontal or generally upward position during cycling.
      <br/>
      This achieves smoother and faster rotation of the pedals and in turn the crank and sprocket resulting in greater cycle speed for a specific cyclist.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Referring now to FIGS. 9 and 10, there is shown another embodiment of the ankle-foot energy member of the present invention which instead of utilizing a loop at the front end utilizes a buckle 56 on the front of the cyclist's shoe 52 for receiving the energy member 60 as best shown in FIGS. 9 and 10. The rear ends 62 and 63 of the foot member are also provided with hook-pile materials such as Velcro for attaching the rear members 62 and 63 to each other about the upper rear end of the cyclist's shoe 52 as best shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment the energy members extending along the calf or calves do not extend about the bottom of the cyclist's foot but rather are passed through buckles 54 suitably mounted on opposite sides of the cyclist's shoe 52 as best shown in FIGS. 9 and 10 for receiving and securing the end portions of the energy members such as shown at 16a in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      If desired the end portion 16a may be further fastened again through Velcro material on the main body of the energy member 16.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The energy members 14, 16 and 18 of the present invention may be worn with or without an outer garment or tights.
      <br/>
      FIG. 11 shows them worn with an outer net like garment in the form of bikers pants or tights 72.
      <br/>
      In addition and although not shown, the energy members 14, 16, and 18 of the present invention may be incorporated as an integral part of a cyclist's tights or pants to provide the same tension force upon the downstroke to aid the legs upon the upstroke as described above.
      <br/>
      The tights may be made from LYCRA or any other suitable material including stretchable material to provide energy members in accordance with the present invention.
    </p>

      It will be seen from the above that the present invention will not only create additional force to be transferred directly to the legs to assist the legs in pedaling the bike but it will also provide additional force available to the hamstrings muscles to bring them to balance or closer to balance with respect to the quadriceps muscles in cases where these muscles are out of balance in a given cyclist.
      <br/>
      The result is that a given cyclist using the energy members of the present invention will be able to increase the speed of a given cycle.
