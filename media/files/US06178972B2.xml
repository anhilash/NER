    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for manufacturing a semiconductor integrated circuit, and more particularly, to a technique for reducing occurrence of wiring defects in the semiconductor integrated circuit during the process of forming a wiring structure, so as to elevate the quality level of the wiring structure and consequently the quality level of the semiconductor integrated circuit, thus to elevate the productivity of the semiconductor integrated circuit.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="2">In a semiconductor integrated circuit, generally, semiconductor elements such as transistors etc. are formed on a semiconductor substrate, and also a wiring structure which connects the semiconductor elements to one another or connects the semiconductor elements to external circuits is formed on the semiconductor substrate.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Conventionally, as the wiring structure as mentioned above, there has been used widely a wiring structure in which wiring patterns comprised of a polycrystalline silicon film, a high melting metal film, a high melting metal silicide film, a high melting metal polycide film, an aluminum film or an aluminum alloy film are combined.
      <br/>
      Recently among those, a high melting metal wiring, in which a tungsten wiring (W wiring) is a typical one, has been used widely, since it has low resistance as compared with a polycrystalline silicon wiring pattern or a high melting metal polycide wiring pattern, also has generally good ability for step-coverage of the high melting metal film during a deposition process by means of the chemical vapor deposition method (the CVD method), and further has good reliability such as durability of electro-migration as compared with an aluminum wiring.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Further, as a fine contact member which connects the wiring pattern to the semiconductor substrate or to another lower wiring pattern, there has been used widely such a plug contact that is formed by filling a contact hole linked to the semiconductor substrate or to the lower wiring pattern, with a high melting metal film formed by the above-mentioned CVD method having good ability for step-coverage, for the purpose of reducing the contact resistance of the contact member, or elevating the reliability of the contact member.
      <br/>
      So there has been used widely a wiring structure which is entirely comprised of combination of the plug contacts and the wiring patterns.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      On the other hand it is indispensable to elevate wiring density of the semiconductor integrated circuit for the purpose of achieving high integration and high functionality of the semiconductor integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      Therefore it is required to reduce the wiring pitch as possible as it can.
      <br/>
      Thus, as one of methods to be able to elevate the substantial wiring density extremely, a multi-layer type wiring structure also has been used.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Moreover the conventional wiring structures as mentioned above have been disclosed, for instance, in the documents of "A Double Level Metallization System Having 2  MU m Pitch for Both Level", T.Doan et. al., pp.13-20, VMIC Conference, 1988, and "SUBMICRON WIRING TECHNOLOGY WITH TUNGSTEN AND PLANARIZATION", C. Kaanta et. al., pp.21-28, VMIC Conference, 1988.</p>
    <p num="7">However according to the conventional manufacturing methods of the wiring structure, there have been such problems that debris or residues formed in the wiring forming process often cause wiring defects, so that the quality level of the wiring structure and consequently the quality of the semiconductor integrated circuit are reduced, or the yield of wiring materials is reduced.</p>
    <p num="8">Moreover in view of the present or future tendency as mentioned above that the wiring pitch is reducing more and more, and further the multi-layer wiring structure is used essentially, it is probable that the above-mentioned problems become more important.</p>
    <p num="9">Hereinafter a conventional manufacturing technique of a semiconductor integrated circuit and problems of the technique will be described concretely with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="10">
      FIG. 16 is a vertical sectional view that shows an example of a conventional wiring structure of a semiconductor integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 16, there is shown a four-layer type wiring structure, in which a first stratiform wiring 305 (a gate electrode 303) is comprised of a high melting metal polycide wiring, a second stratiform wiring 4 is comprised of a high melting metal wiring, a third stratiform wiring 7 and a fourth stratiform wiring 10 are respectively comprised of an aluminum wiring.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      As shown in FIG. 16, in the conventional semiconductor integrated circuit, a semiconductor element 2 (transistor 2) is formed on a silicon substrate 1 (silicon semiconductor substrate).
      <br/>
      Hereupon the tungsten polycide layer (W polycide layer, WSi2 /poly-Si) which constructs the gate electrode 303 of the semiconductor element 2 is a part of the first stratiform wiring 305.
    </p>
    <p num="12">A lower insulating film 3 comprised of SiO2 or BPSG (Boro-Phosphorous Silicate Glass) etc. is formed by deposition process on the semiconductor element 2 (transistor 2), and further on the lower insulating film 3, there is formed contact holes 306,307 which are used for performing electrical connection between impurity diffusion layers 304 formed on the silicon substrate 1 or the first stratiform wiring 305 and other wirings.</p>
    <p num="13">
      Further the second stratiform wiring 4 (tungsten wiring) comprised of tungsten is provided on the lower insulating film 3.
      <br/>
      The tungsten film 4 (W film) is generally formed by deposition process by means of the CVD method, and also has good ability of step-coverage, so that the contact holes 306,307 are filled with parts of the tungsten film 4, as apparent from FIG. 16.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Further a planed first interlayer insulating film 5 is formed on the second stratiform wiring 4 (tungsten wiring), and then there is formed in the first interlayer insulating film 5 a plurality of primary via-holes 313 for performing electrical connections between the second stratiform wiring 4 and other wirings.
      <br/>
      Moreover, as apparent from FIG. 16, the primary via-holes 313 are filled with parts of tungsten film, so that the parts of tungsten film form plug contacts 6.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Moreover the third stratiform wiring 7 (aluminum wiring) is formed on the film 5.
      <br/>
      Similarly, on the third stratiform wiring 7 (aluminum wiring), there are formed a second interlayer insulating film 8, a plurality of secondary via-holes 321 in which plug contacts 9 comprised of tungsten for connecting electrically the third stratiform wiring 7 to other wirings are formed, the fourth stratiform wiring 10 (aluminum wiring) comprised of aluminum, and a protection insulating film 11 which covers the fourth stratiform film 10.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Hereinafter a conventional manufacturing method of the wiring structure of the semiconductor integrated circuit will be described step by step with reference to FIGS. 17-28.</p>
    <p num="17">
      At first, as shown in FIG. 17, the semiconductor element 2 (transistor 2) is formed on the surface of a silicon substrate 1.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor element 2 (transistor 2) is comprised of an element separating oxide film 301, a gate oxide film 302, the gate electrode 303 having a tungsten polycide structure (W polycide structure) comprised of a polycrystalline silicon 303a and a tungsten silicide 303b (WSiO2), and the impurity diffusion layers 304.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Further the tungsten polycide layer (WSiO2 /poly-Si) which constructs the gate electrode 303 is also formed on the element separating oxide film 301, and then the layer is used as the first stratiform wiring 305 (305a,305b).
      <br/>
      And on the semiconductor element 2 (transistor 2) and the first stratiform wiring 305, there are formed by deposition process the lower insulating film 3 comprised of silicon oxide film (SiO2), BPSG (Boro-Phosphorous Silicate Glass) film which is a doped silicon oxide film containing boron (B) or phosphorous (P), and so on.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Next, as shown in FIG. 18, the contact holes 306,307 are formed at a predetermined parts of the lower insulating film 3 by means of a photoengraving technique and a dry etching technique, in order to form electrical contacts for connecting the impurity diffusion layers 304 formed on the silicon substrate 1 or the first stratiform wiring 305 to other wirings.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 19, a barrier metal film 308 is formed by deposition procession the whole surface of the lower insulating film 3.
      <br/>
      The barrier metal 308 is generally formed by means of a sputter etching, and then the barrier metal 308 is required to have qualities as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      (a) The barrier metal 308 can contact stably to the silicon substrate 1 (impurity diffusion layer 304) with a low resistance.
      <br/>
      (b) The barrier metal 308 can have a good adhesion with a tungsten film 309 formed by deposition process thereon as under-layer.
      <br/>
      Generally speaking, the adhesion between a tungsten film and a silicon oxide film is weak.
      <br/>
      (c) The barrier metal 308 can prevent the silicon substrate 1 (impurity diffusion layer) from suffering a damage caused by gas such as WF6 used at the time of forming of the tungsten film 309 by means of the CVD method.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Hereat, as such a barrier metal film 308, there are used widely a laminated film comprised of titanium (Ti) and titanium nitride (TiN), titanium-tungsten film (TiW) and so on.</p>
    <p num="23">
      After forming of the barrier metal film 308, the semiconductor integrated circuit is subjected to a short thermal treatment of a few ten seconds to a few minutes at 600-800 (degree)  C., in order to perform a stable contact with low resistance between the barrier metal 308 and the silicon substrate 1 (the impurity diffusion layer 304) or the first stratiform wiring 305.
      <br/>
      Then, for example, using gases such as WF6, H2 and so on, the tungsten film 309 is formed by deposition process on the whole surface of the barrier metal 308, under the condition of 400-500 (degree)  C. depositing temperature by means of the CVD method.
    </p>
    <p num="24">In this case, since the tungsten film 309 is formed by means of the CVD method, the tungsten film 309 can possesses good step-coverage, so that the contact holes 306,307 are filled completely with parts of the tungsten film 309, as apparent from FIG. 19.</p>
    <p num="25">Next, as shown in FIG. 20, the barrier metal film 308 and tungsten film 309 formed by deposition process on the lower insulating film 3 are generally subjected to a patterning treatment using a photoengraving technique and a dry etching technique, so that the second stratiform wiring 4 (tungsten wiring) is formed.</p>
    <p num="26">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 21, the primary interlayer insulating film 5 is formed on the second stratiform wiring 4 (tungsten wiring).
      <br/>
      The primary interlayer insulating film 5 is, for example, such an insulating film that is comprised of a combination of a silicon oxide film 310 formed by deposition process by means of the CVD method, an inorganic coating insulating film 311 and a silicon oxide film 312 formed by deposition process by means of the CVD method.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The silicon oxide film 310 is generally formed by a deposition process by means of the CVD method using heat or plasma at 300-450 (degree)  C. of depositing temperature under a surroundings of gas mixture containing silane gas (SiH4) and oxygen gas (O2) or nitrogen suboxide gas (N2 O).
      <br/>
      Moreover it may be used such a silicon oxide film that is formed by a deposition process using organic silane type materials such as TEOS (Tetra-Ethyl-Ortho-Silicate) etc. which have good step-coverage.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Hereat as the inorganic coating insulating film 311 formed for planarization, it is generally used such a film that contains silanol (Si(OH)4) as a main component.
      <br/>
      A material which contains silanol as a main component is painted on the silicon oxide film 310 by rotary-painting process to be formed a layer, and then the layer is subjected to a baking treatment at 400-450 (degree)  C., thus to be converted to a silicon oxide film, so that the surface of the silicon oxide film 310 formed by means of the CVD method is planed.
      <br/>
      And then the silicon oxide film 312 is formed on the inorganic coating insulating film 311 by deposition process as the same process as the process of forming the silicon oxide film 310.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Next, as shown in FIG. 22, at predetermined portions of the primary interlayer insulating film 5, there are formed the primary via-holes 313 by means of a photoengraving technique and a dry etching technique, in order to enable to form electrical contact between the second stratiform wiring 4 (tungsten wiring) and an upper wiring which will be formed thereafter.</p>
    <p num="30">Further, as shown in FIG. 23, after cleaning of a bottom of the primary via-holes 313 by means of a sputter etching treatment using argon ions (Ar+), on a whole surface of the primary interlayer insulating film 5, there is formed by deposition process an under film 314 for the first tungsten plug contacts 6, in order to perform a stable connection with low resistance between the second stratiform wiring 4 (tungsten wiring) and an upper wiring.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The under film 314 for the first tungsten plug contacts 6 is generally formed by means of deposition of the sputter method, wherein tungsten plug contacts 6 are required to have such properties as follows.
      <br/>
      (a) The plug contacts 6 can make stable contact with low resistance to the lower wiring (in this case, the second stratiform wiring 4).
      <br/>
      (b) The under film 314 can have a good adhesion to the tungsten film 315 to be formed by deposition process thereon.
      <br/>
      An adhesion between a tungsten film and a silicon oxide film is generally poor.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Hereat, as the under film 314 as mentioned above, there are used widely a laminated film comprised of titanium (Ti) and titanium nitride (TiN), titanium-tungsten film (TiW) and so on.
      <br/>
      After this a tungsten film 315 is formed by deposition process by means of the CVD method on a whole surface of the under film 314 at the condition as well as in forming the second stratiform wiring 4 (tungsten wiring).
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Next, as shown in FIG. 24, the tungsten film 315 is subjected to an etch-back treatment by means of a dry etching technique, for example, using gas such as SF6, so that parts of the tungsten film 315 which is remained in the first via-holes 313 result in the tungsten plug contacts 6.
      <br/>
      At this time, as the etching condition has been predetermined such that the etching rate of the titanium nitride film is much lower than that of the tungsten film (about 1/20-1/50), the under film 314 acts as a stopper against the tungsten etch-back treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      After this, as shown in FIG. 25, an aluminum alloy film 316 is formed on the whole surface of the semiconductor integrated circuit on a way of manufacturing process by deposition process by means of the sputter method, and then an antireflection film 317 is formed on the aluminum alloy film 316 by the same process.
      <br/>
      Hereat the aluminum alloy film 316 is generally comprised of an aluminum alloy containing impurity elements such as Cu, for example Al--Si--Cu or Al--Cu, in order to elevate the reliability of the aluminum alloy wiring.
      <br/>
      On the other hand the antireflection film 317 is generally comprised of titanium nitride which has low reflectance in a wavelength region such as i-line or g-line for photoengraving, in order to elevate photoengraving margin of the third stratiform wiring 7 (the aluminum wiring).
    </p>
    <p num="35">And then, as shown in FIG. 26, the under film 314 of the tungsten plug contacts 6, the aluminum alloy film 316 and the antireflection film 317 are subjected to a patterning treatment by means of a photoengraving technique and a dry etching technique, so that the third stratiform wiring 7 (aluminum wiring) is formed.</p>
    <p num="36">Hereinafter, in the same manner, there is formed the secondary interlayer insulating film 8 comprised of a silicon oxide film 318 formed by deposition process by means of the CVD method, an inorganic coating insulating film 319 and a silicon oxide film 320 formed by deposition process by means of the CVD method.</p>
    <p num="37">Next the secondary via-holes 321 are formed at a predetermined parts of the secondary interlayer insulating film 8 by means of a photoengraving technique and a dry etching technique, in order to form electrical contacts for connecting the third stratiform wiring 7 (the aluminum wiring) to another wiring.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 27, there is formed by deposition process a laminated film 322 comprised of titanium (Ti) and titanium nitride (TiN), which is an under film of the secondary tungsten plug contacts 9, and then a tungsten film is formed by deposition process thereon, so that the tungsten film is subjected to etch-back treatment all over the surface thereof to be formed the secondary tungsten plug contacts 9.
      <br/>
      Moreover, on the surface of the laminated film 322, there is formed by deposition process an aluminum alloy film 323 comprised of Al--Si--Cu or Al--Cu, further there is formed thereon by deposition process a titanium nitride film 324 which acts as a antireflection film, then the fourth aluminum wiring 10 is formed by means of patterning treatment using a photoengraving technique or a dry etching technique, so that the wiring structure as shown in FIG. 27 is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Finally, as shown in FIG. 28, on the fourth aluminum wiring 10, there is formed the protective insulating film 11 comprised of a silicon nitride film, silicon oxide film, silicon oxide nitride film, or a combination of those.</p>
    <p num="40">However according to the above-mentioned conventional method for manufacturing the wiring structure of the semiconductor integrated circuit, there is such a problem that if debris or residues are created during the process time, and the debris or residues remain in the wiring structure, they result in a wiring defect.</p>
    <p num="41">For example, in the manufacturing process for forming the second stratiform wiring 4 (tungsten wiring) of the four-layer type wiring structure as shown in FIG. 16, let us suppose that a debris 401 adheres on the barrier metal 308, and then the tungsten film 309 is formed over the debris at the step of forming the film 309, as shown in FIG. 29.</p>
    <p num="42">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 30, a photo resist pattern 402 is formed by means of a photoengraving technique, and then when the photo resist pattern is subjected to a patterning treatment by means of a dry etching technique, around the debris 401, there remains a residue 404 of tungsten or a residue 405 of the barrier metal film 308 under the second stratiform wiring 4.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, polymer 403 containing tungsten adheres on the side wall of the second stratiform wiring 4 (tungsten wiring) or the photo resist 402 during the dry etching process.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      And then, as shown FIG. 31, on the wiring, there remains a polymer 406 which has not been removed completely during the photo resist removal process, or around the debris 401 among the wiring, there remain residues 404,405 of tungsten or barrier metal.
      <br/>
      Thus there is such a problem that the polymer or the residue often causes a short circuit among the wirings, or results in a wiring defect to be formed thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Further, as another example, in the manufacturing process for forming the plug contacts 6 of the four-layer type wiring structure as shown in FIG. 16, let us suppose that a debris 407 adheres on the under film 314, and then the tungsten film 315 is formed by deposition process on the debris, as shown in FIG. 32.</p>
    <p num="45">
      In this case, as shown in FIG. 33, when the whole surface of the tungsten film 315 (see FIG. 32) is subjected to an etch-back treatment, a tungsten film 408 remains around the debris 407.
      <br/>
      Further according to circumstances a mere etch-back residue 409 of tungsten caused by etch-back process may remain.
      <br/>
      Then, after the aluminum alloy film 315 and the antireflection film 316 are formed by deposition process on the debris 407 or the residues 408,409, the third stratiform wiring 7 (aluminum wiring) is formed by means of a photoengraving technique or a dry etching technique, and then there is such a problem that a short circuit occurs near the debris 407 or the etch-back residue 409 at that time.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Thus many kinds of methods for removing debris or residues as mentioned above have been examined.
      <br/>
      For example, in the report titled "Multiobjective Washing Method by means of H2 SO4 /H2 O2 /HF Solution" written by Ohnishi et. al. inserted in the monthly magazine "Semiconductor World" pp. 26-28, published November 1993, there has been disclosed a washing method for washing a silicon substrate using chemicals containing strong acid or strong base.
      <br/>
      However according to such a conventional washing method that has high ability of washing, there is such a problem that wirings themselves are etched very strongly by the chemicals containing strong acid or strong base, thus to be suffered a damage.
      <br/>
      Therefore the conventional washing method is not appropriate as a method for washing the above-mentioned wiring structure during a wiring forming process.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Therefore, as a washing method for washing such a wiring structure during a wiring forming process, a physical washing method in which any chemicals are not used and only pure water is used has been generally used.
      <br/>
      One of such conventional washing methods has been disclosed in the report titled "The Equipment Washing Apparatus" written by Hirai, inserted in the monthly magazine "Semiconductor World" pp. 138-142, published August 1993.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      As disclosed in the report, as physical washing methods using pure water, such methods as follows have been conventionally known.
      <br/>
      (a) Brush washing: This is such a washing method that a brush of cylindrical type or disk type is pushed against a surface of a wafer, and then the brush and the wafer are both rotated, so that the wafer is washed.
      <br/>
      (b) High-pressure jet washing: This is such a washing method that water containing only mere CO2 for preventing occurrence of static electricity is blown against a wafer with high pressure, so that the wafer is washed.
      <br/>
      (c) Ultrasonic wave washing: This is such a washing method that ultrasonic wave having frequency of about 1 MHz is added to a nozzle for pure water, so that vibration is added to pure water, and then the pure water is blown to a wafer.
      <br/>
      (d) Pure water rinsing: This is such a method that a wafer is washed by means of only pure water blowing thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="49">Hereat each of these washing processes is generally performed by means of an apparatus called "spin-scrubber", in which the wafer is subjected to a spinning treatment one by one.</p>
    <p num="50">
      However in each of the above-mentioned conventional physical washing methods, washing ability is poor in comparison with the conventional chemical washing method using chemicals.
      <br/>
      Consequently, according to each of the conventional physical washing methods, though debris or residues located merely on a surface of the semiconductor integrated circuit can be removed, sufficient washing effect cannot be achieved for debris buried partially in a film or debris or residues adhered strongly to the film.
      <br/>
      The reason is such that though it is necessary for achieving a high washing effect to etch the under film slightly, it is theoretically impossible for a physical washing using pure water to etch so.
    </p>
    <p num="51">As mentioned above, for example, in the method for manufacturing the wiring structure of the semiconductor integrated circuit as shown in FIG. 16, it is necessary to get a new washing method that can wash away (remove) debris or residues without causing an extreme etch or a damage on the wiring structure, in order to prevent wiring defects caused by the debris or the residues formed during the wiring structure forming process.</p>
    <p num="52">However according to a washing method using acid solution or alkali solution, since the wiring patterns or the plug contacts comprised of high melting metal such as tungsten etc. are generally connected electrically to an impurity diffusion layer, there occurs a galvanic action caused by contact electric potential of PN junction of the part or a galvanic action caused by contact electric potential difference between different metals for example between a tungsten layer and a barrier metal layer, so that an extreme etch or a damage of the wiring structure is unavoidable.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="53">The present invention has been developed to solve the above-mentioned conventional problems, and has an object of providing means which can remove debris or residues effectively without causing an extreme etching or a damage in a wiring structure during a process of forming a wiring structure of a semiconductor integrated circuit.</p>
    <p num="54">
      In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, according to the present invention, in a washing treatment for a wiring structure comprised of high melting metal, high melting metal silicide, high melting metal compound and/or so on, neutral solution of pH 6 to pH 8 containing oxidant, for example aqueous solution of the oxidant etc. is used as washing liquid.
      <br/>
      Preferably neutral solution containing peroxide such as hydrogen peroxide or ozone as oxidant is used.
      <br/>
      Since such neutral solution is neutral, it has such a characteristic that it does not suffer remarkable influence of the above-mentioned galvanic actions.
    </p>
    <p num="55">Moreover it is believed conventionally that such neutral solution containing oxidant scarcely etches high melting metal etc. within a comparatively low or normal temperature region of about 20 to 40 (degree)  C. However, according to the result obtained through the present inventors' detail experiment, it is identified that the etching rate of a large wiring pattern having a width or diameter larger than a several millimeters in plane view is surely small, but the etching rate of residue caused by a very small debris having a width or diameter of half-micron order in plane view is considerably large (more than a hundred times of the etching rate of the large wiring pattern).</p>
    <p num="56">After all etching rate remarkably depends on a size of a material to be etched, so that a wiring pattern with a relatively large surface area is scarcely etched (less damage), on the other hand etching rate of a debris or residue with a very small surface area is large.</p>
    <p num="57">For example, in FIG. 1, there is shown an example of area-dependency of etching rate of a tungsten film against hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution of normal temperature.</p>
    <p num="58">Therefore, by utilizing such etching characteristic preferably, it becomes possible that only a very small debris or a residue is selectively removed, on the other hand a wiring pattern or a plug contact comprised of high melting metal such as tungsten scarcely suffers a damage.</p>
    <p num="59">Further, the present inventors have found out such fact that when the above-mentioned chemical washing process using neutral solution containing oxidant is combined with a physical washing process using brushes, high pressure jet, ultrasonic wave, fine water particles or fine ice particles, washing (removal) operation against the debris or the residue is further elevated by an interaction or an additive action of the both.</p>
    <p num="60">Then more concretely, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a semiconductor integrated circuit in which semiconductor elements and a wiring structure connecting the semiconductor elements one another are located on a semiconductor substrate, the method comprising the steps of, forming sequentially a series of wiring elements, each of which constructs the wiring structure, and washing the semiconductor integrated circuit under manufacturing process, by means of neutral solution containing oxidant, during a term of forming of the wiring elements.</p>
    <p num="61">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method, wherein, in the first aspect of the present invention, peroxide is used as the oxidant.</p>
