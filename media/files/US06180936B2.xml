    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      Photoreceptors convert received light rays into an analog electrical signal that can be digitalized.
      <br/>
      For example, photoreceptors can be situated in a digital camera that registers an arbitrary image in analog form, is digitalized following the photoreceptors and is further-processed in digitalized form, for example in a computer.
      <br/>
      However, the photoreceptors can also be utilized as an independent sensor system independently of a video camera, for example in image processing.
      <br/>
      A further employment of photoreceptors can be seen in a realization of what is referred to as a technical eye.

      In the photoreceptor arrangements described therein, with which the retina of vertebrates is to be simulated, it is also known to embed the photoreceptors in a network.
      <br/>
      As a result of this procedure, it is beginning to become possible to implement a filtering of the registered image information.
      <br/>
      In said works, the coupling of the photoreceptors ensues mainly with the goal of intensifying contrast.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The known arrangements, however, exhibit some disadvantages and deliver only unsatisfactory results.
      <br/>
      In particular, the couplings in the cited networks are fixed and not fashioned variable dependent, for example, on the illumination intensity of the photoreceptor arrangement.
      <br/>
      These models can thus only be meaningfully employed in a small range of an illumination intensity predetermined by the coupling intensities.

      The German reference DE 43 37 160 A1, discloses a photodetector array.

      The photodetector array comprises a plurality of photodetector elements regularly arranged in a surface.
      <br/>
      At least two layers, layers A and B, are provided, whereby the photodetector elements are arranged in the first layer A facing toward the light incidence and are directly connected to one another via paths of controllable electrical conductivity, for example channels of MOS transistors.

      Further circuit elements are accommodated in a second layer arranged coplanar with the first.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">The invention is based on the problem of specifying a photoreceptor arrangement that avoids the disadvantages of the known arrangements.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In general terms the present invention is a photoreceptor arrangement for the reception of light rays.
      <br/>
      At least two photoreceptors are provided with which light rays that impinge the photoreceptor arrangement are registered and converted into electrical signals.
      <br/>
      The photoreceptors are coupled to one another.
      <br/>
      The coupling of the photoreceptors is a variable coupling.
      <br/>
      At least one coupling element that is respectively coupled to an output of the corresponding photoreceptor is provided for at least a part of the photoreceptors.
      <br/>
      The coupling elements are variably coupled to one another.
      <br/>
      An output of at least a part of the coupling elements are coupled to a first input of a respective adder unit.
      <br/>
      At least a part of the outputs of the corresponding photoreceptors are coupled to a second input of the adder unit.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Advantageous development of the present invention are as follows.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The coupling of the photoreceptors is dependent on the luminous intensity of the light rays incident onto the arrangement.
      <br/>

    <p num="28">
      The features of the present invention which are believed to be novel, are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The invention, together with further objects and advantages, may best be understood by reference to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in the several Figures of which like reference numerals identify like elements, and in which:

    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 1 shows an example of a photoreceptor arrangement.
      <br/>
      An arbitrary plurality of photoreceptors P are arranged next to one another in the photoreceptor arrangement.
      <br/>
      The photoreceptors P are coupled to one another via couplings K. Light rays LS (see FIG. 2) incident onto the photoreceptors P are registered by the photoreceptors p and converted into electrical signals.
    </p>
    <p num="30">"Lateral interactions" between the individual photoreceptors P are realized by the couplings K. Dependent on the degree of the lateral interaction, differences in the receptor voltages are thus compensated to different extents.</p>
    <p num="31">An analog image that is formed by the light rays LS incident onto the photoreceptors P is smoothed by the lateral interactions, i.e. by the couplings K between the photoreceptors P. The photoreceptor arrangement thus represents a low pass for the original image registered by the photoreceptor arrangement.</p>
    <p num="32">The electrical signals that the photoreceptors P make available for further-processing and that thus represent the image are further-processed in an arbitrary way, for example in the scope of a digital image processing.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The lateral interaction between the couplings K can be presented in the following way in mathematical expressions.
      <br/>
      A luminous intensity of a photoreceptor P at a position x is referenced with  XI x in the following rule.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Assuming linear relationships, the dynamics of the photoreceptor arrangement can be described by the following rule:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="35">ALPHA x references an output signal of the photoreceptor P at the respective position x. Due to the coupling K, the photoreceptor P at the position x is influenced not only by the external signal  XI x, for example the luminous intensity, but output signals of the neighboring photoreceptors P are also taken into consideration dependent on the size of an interaction intensity w.</p>
    <p num="36">A photoreceptor P that is coupled by a coupling K to the respective photoreceptor P whose output signal  ALPHA x is respectively unambiguously described in position with an index y. NN(x) references the entire set of photoreceptors P coupled to the respective photoreceptor P by coupling K. A freely prescribable time integration constant is described with r.</p>
    <p num="37">
      The couplings K can extend over an arbitrary set of photoreceptors.
      <br/>
      It is thus definitely not required--as indeed shown in FIG. 1--that only directly neighboring photoreceptors P are respectively coupled to one another.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In a development, however, it is provided to respectively consider only a prescribable area around a respective photoreceptor P and, thus, to also only consider a specific, other photoreceptors P located around the photoreceptor P according to the prescribable area in the rule (1).
      <br/>
      A considerable saving of outlay and costs in the production of the overall photoreceptor arrangement is achieved by this development.
      <br/>
      This effect is improved further in a development of the arrangement in that only directly neighboring photoreceptors P are respectively coupled to the respective photoreceptor P and, thus, are also only considered in the rule (1).
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The position of the photoreceptors p is also arbitrary.
      <br/>
      In a development of the photoreceptor arrangement, however, it is advantageous, particularly for simple presentability of the properties of the photoreceptor arrangement, that the photoreceptors p are arranged in an array, i.e. a grid.
      <br/>
      In this way, the photoreceptors P are respectively arranged at the same spacing from one another.
      <br/>
      In this development, a spacing between the respective photoreceptors P is referenced with a symbol a.
    </p>
    <p num="40">By transformation of the rule (1) into the frequency space, one obtains the following description in the frequency space for rule (1):  (Equation image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="41">In rule (2), k references a spatial frequency, a references the spacing between the photoreceptors P--this spacing is referred to a grid constant a given regular spacings--and J0 references the 0th Bessel function.</p>
    <p num="42">
      Fixed points of rule (2) correspond to the response behavior of the photoreceptor arrangement GNNw (k) for the stationary case.
      <br/>
      The response behavior GNNw (k) is then established by the following rule:  (Equation image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="43">For positive values of the interaction intensity w, this response behavior GNNw (k) describes a low pass.</p>
    <p num="44">The interaction intensity w of the couplings K between the photoreceptors P is fashioned variable in the photoreceptor arrangement.</p>
    <p num="45">In a development of the photoreceptor arrangement, it is advantageous to variably adapt the interaction intensity w dependent on the luminous intensity  XI x of the light rays LS that impinge the photoreceptors P. It is thereby advantageous to reduce the interaction intensity w with increasing luminous intensity  XI x. With decreasing luminous intensity  XI x, it is advantageous to intensity the interaction intensity w between the photoreceptors P, i.e. to increase the values of the interaction intensity w. Examples of a possible dimensioning of the interaction intensity w are described later.</p>
    <p num="46">
      Presented graphically, an intensification of the couplings K by increasing the interaction intensity w means an intensified noise suppression in the individual photoreceptors P. Further, it leads to a reduction of the precision achieved, as a result whereof, greater ruggedness of the photoreceptor arrangement to noise is achieved.
      <br/>
      Corresponding to the adaptation of the photoreceptor arrangement to the luminous intensity  XI x, an adaptation of the interaction intensity w to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is provided in a development of the photoreceptor arrangement.
      <br/>
      It is thereby provided that the size of the interaction intensity w is reduced given increasing signal-to-noise ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      It is also provided in a development of the photoreceptor arrangement to fashion the interaction intensity w dependent on the statistics of the received signals.
      <br/>
      What is thereby to be particularly graphically understood is the influence of the statistics of an image to be processed on a filter structure to be approximated by the photoreceptor arrangement.
      <br/>
      The statistics of the image signals of the registered image also influences the desired filter function realized by the couplings between the photoreceptors P and the photoreceptors P.
    </p>
    <p num="48">In order to suitable simulate the characteristic of the human eye, which exhibits both low passes as well as high passes dependent on the lighting conditions, the following architecture of the photoreceptor arrangement is provided in a development of the photoreceptor arrangement.</p>
    <p num="49">
      Proceeding from the above-described photoreceptor arrangement, additional coupling elements KE are provided.
      <br/>
      A first input E1 of at least one coupling element KE is coupled to an output A of at least one photoreceptor P.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      This means that the output signal  ALPHA x of the photoreceptor P is respectively supplied to a coupling element KE.
      <br/>
      Further, the coupling elements KE are likewise coupled to one another via couplings, which are referenced as coupling element couplings KEK below.
      <br/>
      The coupling element couplings KEK can likewise be fashioned variable. the intensity of the coupling element couplings KEK is referenced as intermediate interaction intensity u (see FIG. 2).
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The respective output signal  ALPHA x of the photoreceptor P is supplied to the respective coupling element KE arbitrarily weighted, for example with the weighting value 1.
      <br/>
      Further, at least one adder unit AE is provided that is coupled both to a respective output A of the photoreceptor P as well as to an output AKE of the respective coupling element KE.
      <br/>
      This means that an output signal of the coupling element KE is respectively supplied to a first input AE1 of the adder unit AE.
      <br/>
      Further, the output signal  ALPHA x of the respective photoreceptor P is supplied via a second input AE2 of the respective adder unit AE.
      <br/>
      The signals are again supplied with arbitrary weighting, for example the weighting with the value 1, to the adder unit AE.
    </p>
    <p num="52">It is provided in a development of the photoreceptor arrangement to supply the output signals of the coupling elements KE to the adder unit AE negatively weighted with a weighting factor v.</p>
    <p num="53">For the development of the photoreceptor arrangement that the output signal  ALPHA x of the respective photoreceptor P is supplied to the adder unit AE weighted with the value 1 and the output signal of the respective coupling element is supplied to the adder unit AE negatively weighted with the weighting factor v, the following rule derives for the response behavior of the overall system Guvw (k), i.e. of the overall photoreceptor arrangement, in the frequency space:</p>
    <p num="54">Guvw (k)=GNNw (k) * (1-v * GNNw (k))  (4)</p>
    <p num="55">In this way, it is possible to generate both low passes as well as high passes merely by a realization of low passes.</p>
    <p num="56">FIG. 3 shows various filters that can be realized with the photoreceptor arrangement over a frequency f by way of example.</p>
    <p num="57">For example, a high pass HP is realized with the following values for the prescribable parameters of the photoreceptor arrangement:</p>
    <p num="58">
      interaction intensity w: 0.3.
      <br/>
      intermediate interaction intensity u: 0.9, and
      <br/>
      weighting factor v: 0.095.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      For realizing a low pass TP, for example, the following parameter values can be selected:
      <br/>
      interaction intensity w: 0.99,
      <br/>
      intermediate interaction intensity u: 0.2, and
      <br/>
      weighting factor v: 0.095.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      For realizing a band pass BP, for example, the following parameters can be selected:
      <br/>
      interaction intensity w: 0.9,
      <br/>
      intermediate interaction intensity u: 0.88, and
      <br/>
      weighting factor v: 0.095.
    </p>
    <p num="61">It can already be seen from this overview that the weighting factor v need not be varied for many filter types, i.e. can be kept constant.</p>
    <p num="62">The above-described parameter values are merely to be understood as an example.</p>
    <p num="63">The couplings K between the photoreceptors P and the coupling element couplings KEK between the coupling elements KE can be realized in various ways.</p>
    <p num="64">For example, it is provided that the couplings K as well as the coupling element couplings KEK be fashioned as electrical lines.</p>
    <p num="65">
      Further, however, it is likewise provided to realize the couplings K and/or coupling element couplings KEK in that the photoreceptors P and/or the coupling elements KE are applied on a variable-conductivity substrate.
      <br/>
      Such a realization of photoreceptors P on a substrate, but with fixed conductivity, is known from the reference J. Heeger et al., Image Enhancement with Polymer Grid Triode Arrays, Science, Vol. 270, pp. 1642-1644, (1995).
    </p>
    <p num="66">However, the specific architecture that was described above in a development of the photo arrangement is not taught by this reference.</p>
    <p num="67">
      It is provided in a development of the photoreceptor arrangement to respectively provide only couplings K or, respectively, coupling element couplings KEK for every coupling element KE or, respectively, for every photoreceptor P in a prescribable surrounding of the respective photoreceptor P or, respectively, coupling element KE.
      <br/>
      As a result thereof, the wiring outlay for the couplings K or, respectively, the coupling element couplings KEK is substantially reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="68">For a photoreceptor P or, respectively, for a coupling element K, it is also provided in a development to provide only couplings K between directly neighboring photoreceptors P or, respectively, only coupling element couplings KEK between directly neighboring coupling elements KE.</p>
    <p num="69">The photoreceptor arrangement can be very advantageously employed, for example, in a video chip for technical vision, for image pre-processing and/or for efficient display and transmission of images.</p>
    <p num="70">One advantage of the photoreceptor arrangement is the universal employability due to the possibility of adapting the photoreceptor arrangement to very different ambient conditions.</p>
    <p num="71">Further advantages are comprised, for example, therein that a desired noise suppression can already ensue at the earliest possible stage by connecting the photoreceptor couplings, and that the necessary dynamic range of the photoreceptors and of the output elements given the development of the photoreceptor arrangement with the further processing layers can be reduced due to the overall filter that is formed by the photoreceptor arrangement.</p>
    <p num="72">
      Only a slight bit depth is thus required in a possibly following digitalization.
      <br/>
      A reduction of the arising data sets can be achieved by this on-chip processing.
    </p>
    <p num="73">Further, images can be filtered in real time due to the fast analog functioning of the photoreceptor arrangement, and a later digital filtering that consumes calculating time thereby becomes superfluous.</p>
    <p num="74">
      The invention is not limited to the particular details of the apparatus depicted and other modifications and applications are contemplated.
      <br/>
      Certain other changes may be made in the above described apparatus without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention herein involved.
      <br/>
      It is intended, therefore, that the subject matter in the above depiction shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
