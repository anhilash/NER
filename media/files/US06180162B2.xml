      <br/>
      An excellent antibacterial property is afforded upon a metallic article by simple steps of coating a dispersion liquid or a solution of fine particles made of an antibacterial ingredient on the surface of the metallic article and pressing the resulting coated surface of the metallic article under a non-heated condition or rubbing the resulting coated surface of the metallic article.
      <br/>
      In addition, a conventional rolling step or the like can be used itself without any change in the above treatment, which is economically extremely advantageous.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since the antibacterial metallic article according to the present invention is obtained under the non-heated condition, the antibacterial ingredient is not deteriorated.
      <br/>
      Further, since the antibacterial property is not lost through some abrasion, excellent antibacterial property can be exhibited over an extended time period.
      <br/>
      Further, there is no fear that surface characteristics of the metallic article, for example, a tone of color will change.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a method for producing an antibacterial metallic article and such an antibacterial metallic article produced by this method.
      <br/>
      Particularly, the invention is to simply and easily afford an antibacterial property upon the metallic articles at a low cost without making any change in the conventional producing process of the metallic articles.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The antibacterial property in the present invention also means anti-mildew property and anti-algae property.
      <br/>
      The metallic article generally includes articles made of metals, for example, metallic articles made of stainless steel and aluminum sheets and plates.
    </p>
    <p num="3">1. Background Techniques</p>
    <p num="4">Among a recent tendency of seeking hygiene and cleanliness, attention has been paid to materials upon which the antibacterial property is afforded by utilizing a metal having a so-called oligodynamic effect to suppress propagation of bacteria, molds, algae, etc. in silver, copper, etc.</p>
    <p num="5">
      It has been demanded that the antibacterial property be afforded upon every material, because toxic bacteria such as disease-causing colon bacilli-157 and MRSA have epidemically occurred.
      <br/>
      Metallic articles are not exceptional for this demand.
    </p>
    <p num="6">For example, JP-A-8 49085 proposes stainless sheet and plate having excellent antibacterial property, which have metallic layers or alloy layers of Cr, Ti, Ni or Fe containing Ag and/or Cu formed on their surfaces by magnetron sputtering, and that such a stainless sheet or plate is preferably formed with a metallic layer or an alloy layer containing 19 to 60 wt % of Ag.</p>
    <p num="7">JP-A-9 176800 proposes a method in which an antibacterial Austenitic stainless steel is obtained by thermally treating an Austenitic stainless steel having a composition containing C, Si, Mn, Cr, Ni and Cu in their respectively specific amounts in a temperature range of 500 to 900 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="8">Besides them, JP-A-10 259,456 discloses a method in which stainless steel sheet and plate having excellent antibacterial property are obtained by incorporating 0.05 to 1.0 wt % of Ag in the stainless steel and dispersing Ag phases having minor axes of not more than 10  MU m in a plane fractional percentage of not less than 0.03% in a matrix.</p>
    <p num="9">However, in the case of the antibacterial stainless steel sheet and plate disclosed in JP-A-8 49,085, the layer containing the antibacterial metal is peeled or removed by drawing or surface-processing, so that there is a problem that an effect thereof will not be expected.</p>
    <p num="10">Furthermore, in this method, since the metallic layer or the alloy layer is formed on the surface of the stainless sheet or plate, there is problems that the number of producing steps increases as compared with the conventional process, and that the surface characteristics of the stainless steel sheet or plate, for example, the tune of color is changed.</p>
    <p num="11">
      Meanwhile, in the Austenitic stainless steel disclosed in JP-A-9-176,800 and stainless steel sheet and plate disclosed in JP-A-10-259,456, the antibacterial ingredient is present uniformly up to an inner portion of the steel sheet.
      <br/>
      However, such stainless steel sheet and plate have a problem that since the antibacterial ingredient deeply existing inside the stainless steel sheet or plate does not exert any effective action upon the bacteria, mold and algae attached to the surface thereof, which is uneconomical.
    </p>
    <p num="12">2. Disclosure of the Invention</p>
    <p num="13">
      The present invention, which has been developed based on the above-mentioned present circumstances, is to solve the above economical problems by concentratedly distributing the antibacterial ingredient in the surface layer portion of the metallic article only.
      <br/>
      The present invention is aimed at proposing a method for advantageously producing the antibacterial metallic article in which the antibacterial property is not lost in a short time through penetrating the antibacterial ingredient into the metallic article by pressing, rubbing or the like, while no adverse effect is given upon the surface property thereof.
      <br/>
      The invention is also aimed at proposing the antibacterial metallic article obtained by this producing method.

    <p num="16">In the following, embodiments according to the present invention in more detail.</p>
    <p num="17">This embodiment is given to concretely illustrate the present invention so that the invention will be more understood, but the invention is not limited thereto unless otherwise specified.</p>
    <p num="18">In the antibacterial metallic article according to this embodiment, the antibacterial component is penetrated directly from the surface of the metal to a portion underneath the metal surface layer under the non-heated condition.</p>
    <p num="19">In this case, in order to penetrate the bacterial ingredient into the metallic article under the non-heated condition, it is preferable that dirt is removed from the antibacterially treated surface of the metallic article by fully washing it, coating the resulting metallic surface is coated with the dispersion liquid or the solution of the fine particles of the antibacterial ingredient (hereinafter referred to as "coating liquid"), and the antibacterial ingredient is impregnated into a portion underneath of the surface layer portion from the metallic surface by pressing the coated metallic surface upon application of pressure under the non-heated condition or by the rubbing treatment of the coated surface.</p>
    <p num="20">In view of the oligodynamic effect, the penetration readiness of the antibacterial ingredient into the metallic article underneath the surface layer portion, the safety and freedom from the surface characteristics of the metallic article such as the tune of color, as the antibacterial ingredient are particularly suitable silver, copper, a silver-copper alloy, silver chloride, silver sulfide, silver oxide, silver sulfate, silver phosphate, a silver salt of an organic acid, copper (I) chloride, copper (II) chloride, copper (I) sulfide, copper (II) sulfide, copper (I) oxide, copper (II) oxide, copper (I) sulfate, copper (II) sulfate, copper phosphate and a copper salt of an organic acid.</p>
    <p num="21">The coating liquid is obtained by dispersing or dissolving fine particles of the antibacterial ingredient in water or an organic solvent, and such a coating liquid of which wettability upon the surface of the metallic article is improved by using a soluble organic acid salt such as sodium citrate, condensed sodium phosphate, a soluble or emulsion-type organic resin, a surface active agent or the like in combination is preferred.</p>
    <p num="22">The coating liquid may be coated by spraying, dipping or the like, which is not particularly restrictive.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The concentration of the antibacterial ingredient is preferably 0.01 to 10 wt % or so.
      <br/>
      If the concentration is lower than this range, sufficient antibacterial property cannot be obtained.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if it is higher than this range, dirt resulting from the antibacterial ingredient is more likely to remain.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The particle diameters of the antibacterial ingredient in the coating liquid are preferably not more than 10  MU m, more preferably not more than 0.1  MU m. If the antibacterial ingredient having such particle diameters is used, it is easily penetrated into the interior beneath the surface layer of the metallic article.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The penetrating depth of the antibacterial ingredient needs to be at least around 0.1  MU m in view of daily treatment such as cleaning.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, no particular limitation is posed upon the penetrating depth of the antibacterial ingredient, but the penetrating depth is sufficiently around 100  MU m in view of the cost, use condition of the article, etc.
      <br/>
      The penetrating depth is preferably in a range of 0.5 to 30  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      After the coating liquid is applied to the surface of the metallic article in the above manner, the antibacterial ingredient is impregnated into the inner portion underneath the surface layer of the metallic article by pressing under the non-heated condition or rubbing according to the first or second invention, respectively.
      <br/>
      In the following, preferred embodiments according to the present invention will be explained.
    </p>
    <p num="27">First Invention</p>
    <p num="28">
      The pressing pressure is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      The pressing pressure is preferably not less than 1 kg/mm2, particularly such that the metallic article may be slightly deformed.
      <br/>
      The pressing time period is not particularly limited, and may be a short time (in an instant).
      <br/>
      An appropriate pressing pressure varies depending upon the kind of the antibacterial ingredient used and the depth at which the antibacterial ingredient is to be penetrated.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The pressing means is not particularly limited, and for example, roll pressing, isostatic pressing or ordinary pressing may be used.
      <br/>
      Particularly, since the rolling pressing method can be employed without making any change to the existing the rolling step, this method is advantageous.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Further, the atmosphere for pressing is not particularly limited, and pressing is ordinarily effected in air.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Although a non-penetrated part of the antibacterial ingredient may remain on the surface of the metallic article after the pressing, it can be easily removed by pickling or polishing.
      <br/>
      Since the antibacterial ingredient is penetrated into a portion of the metallic article underneath the surface layer thereof, the antibacterial property is not lost or degradated even after the removal of the non-penetrated part of the antibacterial ingredient, and excellent bacterial property can be still maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="32">Second Invention</p>
    <p num="33">
      The pressing pressure in the rubbing treatment, there is no particular limitation.
      <br/>
      It is sufficient to lightly rub the coated surface of the metallic article.
      <br/>
      At this time, heating needs not be particularly effected.
    </p>
    <p num="34">The atmosphere in the rubbing is not particularly limited, but the rubbing is ordinarily effected in air.</p>
    <p num="35">As concrete rubbing means, mention may be made of (1) rubbing the coated surface with an object such as a cloth, a paper, a wood piece or a metallic piece, (2) grinding and (3) polishing by way of example.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The antibacterial ingredient in the coating liquid is penetrated into scratches and cracks at the surface of the metallic article and gaps in the grain boundaries of the metallic article, the coating liquid in the above-mentioned rubbing treatment.
      <br/>
      Consequently, even after the antibacterial ingredient remaining on the surface of the metallic article is removed, the antibacterial property is not lost or degraded but excellent antibacterial property is exhibited as in the first invention.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Meanwhile, it is considered that that part of the antibacterial ingredient which is exposed to the surface of the metallic article exhibits the antibacterial property of the antibacterial metallic article.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the surface of the metallic article is worn or corroded, the inner antibacterial ingredient is newly exposed to prevent degradation of the antibacterial property.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Further, since neither metallic layer nor alloy layer is formed on the surface of the metallic article, the surface characteristics of the metallic article, for example, a tone of color do not change.</p>
    <p num="39">Furthermore, since the antibacterial ingredient is penetrated into the metallic article under the non-heated condition, the antibacterial ingredient is not degraded, so that the excellent antibacterial ingredient can be not only maintained, but also less limitation is posed upon the production.</p>
    <p num="40">The metallic article is not particularly limited, and sheets and plates such as stainless steel sheets and plates, iron steel sheets and plates, aluminum sheets and plates, and copper sheets and plates as well as other metallic articles having arbitrary shapes may be recited.</p>
    <p num="41">
      In the first invention, the roll pressing method can be used as the pressing means.
      <br/>
      Since this rolling pressing method does not require any change upon the existing rolling step, the present invention is favorably applied to the roll pressing step, when the metallic article is of a sheet-like or plate-like shape.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      On the other hand, the production of the metallic article includes a polishing or a grinding step.
      <br/>
      An infinite number of scratches, cracks and the like exist in the surfaces of the metallic articles having undergone such a step.
      <br/>
      Further, an infinite number of grain boundaries exist in the metallic articles made of a polycrystal such as stainless steel.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the second invention is applied to the polishing or grinding step, the antibacterial metallic articles can be easily obtained as in the above case without making any change to the existing step.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      As mentioned above, according to the present invention, the antibacterial ingredient can be easily and effectively permeated into a portion of the metallic article under the surface layer, and such a penetrated ingredient can be stably held for a long time period without being lost in a short time period.
      <br/>
      Therefore, excellent antibacterial property can be exhibited over an extended time period.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="44">FIG. 1 is a graph showing the concentration and the penetrated depth of the antibacterial ingredient in a surface layer portion of the metallic article.</p>
    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="45">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="46">An aqueous dispersion liquid of fine silver particles having the average particle diameter of 20 nm (0.02  MU m) prepared by a conventional method is applied to a SUS 430 stainless steel sheet in an amount of 0.1 g/m2 by using a roll coater.</p>
    <p num="47">The silver was penetrated into a portion inside a surface layer of the stainless steel sheet under application of a pressing pressure of 10 kg/mm2 (temperature: 25 (degree)  C.) upon the coated surface with use of a rolling roll.</p>
    <p num="48">Then, the antibacterial stainless steel sheet was obtained by pickling with a 5% aqueous solution of nitric acid.</p>
    <p num="49">The penetrated state of the silver in the surface layer portion of this antibacterial stainless steel sheet was analyzed by a GDMS method (glow discharge mass spectrometry), which confirmed that as shown in FIG. 1, about 400 ppm silver atoms existed at the surface and that silver atoms existed at a depth of up to about 6  MU m. Therefore, the antibacterial property will not be lost by slight wearing.</p>
    <p num="50">With respect to the thus produced antibacterial stainless sheet, an antibacterial test (test bacteria: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) was then effected according to "Film adhering method" specified by Antibacterial Product Technology Association, and results were evaluated.</p>
    <p num="51">Results obtained are shown in Table 1.</p>
    <p num="52">The film adhering method is outlined as follows:</p>
    <p num="53">
      To a test sample was inoculated 0.5 ml/25 cm2 of a bacteria liquid of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus formulated at a bacteria concentration of about 105 cfu/ml and containing ordinary broth diluted at 1/500, and a polyethylene film having the same shape as that of the test sample is placed on the bacteria liquid.
      <br/>
      Then, the bacteria liquid is cultivated at a temperature of 35 (degree)  C. for 24 hours, and the number of living bacteria is measured according to an agar plate method.
