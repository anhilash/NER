    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to sintered bodies which can be used in resistors having a nonlinear resistance (hereinafter "non-linear resistors") and which include zinc oxide (ZnO) as their principal composition.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention relates to a non-linear resistor with superior non-linear current/voltage characteristics, and also with a greatly improved ability to withstand surge current.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Generally, when abnormal voltage due to a lightning strike or lightning-like surge occurs in a power system, or when abnormal voltage due to the switching operation of an electronic equipment circuit (i.e., switching surge) occurs, a lightning arrester or a surge absorber is installed to protect the power system or the electronic equipment from the abnormal voltage.
      <br/>
      The lightning arrester or the surge absorber, which is composed of a non-linear resistor having a sintered body, on the one hand exhibits an insulating property under normal voltages, but exhibits a low resistance property when an abnormal voltage is applied.
      <br/>
      These lightning arresters or surge absorbers, are installed between a terminal of the equipment to be protected, or between the bus-line of the power system, and a ground.
      <br/>
      If abnormal voltage of a specified value or higher is generated by the lightning strike or the like, a discharge begins through the arrester and the abnormal voltage is limited by the discharge current flowing to the ground.
      <br/>
      Then, when the voltage returns to normal, the discharge immediately ceases, and the arrester returns to its former insulated state.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      As disclosed in, for example, JAPANESE KOUKAI Patent PS 59-117202 Publication, the non-linear resistors that are part of the above-mentioned lightning arresters, etc., are produced by the following process.
      <br/>
      A raw material mixture is prepared by combining specified quantities of oxide powders such as Bi2 O3, Sb2 O3, Co2 O3, MnO and Cr2 O3, as auxiliary compositions, with zinc oxide (ZnO) powder, as the principal composition.
      <br/>
      After these raw material mixtures have been mixed together with water and an organic binder, a granulated powder is prepared using a spray drier or like.
      <br/>
      Then, after the granulated powder has been molded into a specified shape, a sintered body having non-linear property is produced by heating to remove the binder and sintering.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 1, the essential components of a lightning arrester or the like are formed by forming a high-resistance layer (i.e., side insulating layer) 2 on the side surface of a sintered body 1, which is the above-mentioned resistor, by coating and re-baking an insulating material to prevent creeping flash-over (see FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      Then respective electrodes 3 are added after polishing the two end surfaces of the sintered body 1.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In recent years, the production of equipment structures that are part of smaller and higher performance electrical transmission and conversion facilities has progressed in order to reduce transmission costs in power systems.
      <br/>
      In order to make transmission and conversion equipment smaller and of higher performance, it is desirable to reduce the requirement for dielectric strength by improving the current/voltage non-linear characteristics of non-linear resistors, which are construction components, and to reduce the residual voltage of lightning arresters.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In particular, with lightning arresters, there is a need for designing lightning arresters smaller by increasing the surge current withstand of the non-linear resistor on the one hand, and by reducing the dimensions, e.g., height, of the non-linear resistor.
      <br/>
      However, there is the problem that, with the non-linear resistor having the prior art composition, the current/voltage non-linear characteristics and surge current withstand are still insufficient.
    </p>

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily apparent and better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows a cross-section showing a non-linear resistor in which electrodes and a side insulation layer are formed on a non-linear resistor.
      <br/>
      FIG.2 shows a perspective side view of a non-linear resistor in which electrodes and a side insulation layer are formed on a sintered body.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="16">The present invention is broadly directed to sintered bodies which are preferably used in resistors having non-linear resistance.</p>
    <p num="17">The performance of a resistor having non-linear resistance is generally defmed by measuring the breakdown voltage.</p>
    <p num="18">
      Then, for each non-linear resistance element, the breakdown voltage (i.e., the value that current starts flowing by reduction of the electrical resistance following an increase in voltage) is measured and, at the same time, the voltage/current non-linear property is evaluated.
      <br/>
      Here, the breakdown voltage is measured as the discharge initiation voltage when a current of 1mA is switched ON, while the voltage/current non-linear characteristics is shown by the value of the ratio shown in Equation (1) below.  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A relatively small value of V10kA /V1mA indicates that non-linear characteristic is excellent.
      <br/>
      In other words, the small value of this ratio means that the non-linear characteristic is excellent.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Here, V10kA means a residual voltage, and V1mA means a varistor voltage.
      <br/>
      In general, these current values are used to evaluate the non-linear characteristic of the non-linear resistor.
      <br/>
      A large value of V10kA means a maximum voltage that the protection instrument, such as the lighting arrester and surge absorber, can protect electrical equipment from abnormal voltage.
      <br/>
      Also, a large value of V10kA means the strength of the non-linear resistance is higher to mechanical destruction by the abnormal voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The resistors of the present invention preferably have a varistor voltage of &gt;400(v/mm), and more preferably &gt;600(v/mm); and a ratio of V10kA :V1kA of &lt;1.5, more preferably &lt;1.4.</p>
    <p num="22">The composition of the sintered body includes ZnO as the principal composition (i.e., component) and bismuth (Bi), cobalt (Co), antimony (Sb), manganese (Mn) and nickel (Ni), as auxiliary compositions (i.e., components).</p>
    <p num="23">In the present invention, "principal composition" is defmed as the amount of ZnO present such that the total amount of ZnO and the auxiliary compositions are 90 mol % of the total composition after sintering, preferably 95 mol %, more preferably 98 mol %, most preferably 100 mol %. Minor amounts of impurities which do not substantially adversely effect the performance of the resistor made from the sintered body may also be present.</p>
    <p num="24">As noted above, the total composition which forms the sintered body also includes auxiliary compositions.</p>
    <p num="25">
      With the above non-linear resistor relating to the present invention, the reason for the contents of bismuth (Bi), cobalt (Co), antimony (Sb), manganese (Mn) and nickel (Ni), as auxiliary compositions, converted respectively to Bi2 O3, Co2 O3, Sb2 O3, MnO, and NiO, being in the range of 0.05 to 10 mol %, preferably, 0.05 to 10.0 mol %, respectively, is that, outside the above range, the non-linear resistance property and life property deteriorate.
      <br/>
      Here, life property means a characteristic that the leakage current is at a stable low level over a long period of time.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Of the above auxiliary compositions, in particular, Bi2 O3 is a composition that manifests non-linear resistance by being present on the grain boundaries.
      <br/>
      Co2 O3 is also effective for greatly improving non-linear resistance by going into solid solution with ZnO, which is the principal composition.
      <br/>
      Sb2 O3 contributes to the improvement of the varistor voltage and the surge current-resistant capacity by forming spinel.
      <br/>
      MnO also improves the non-linear resistance by going into solid solution in the ZnO and the spinel, while NiO is also an effective composition for improving non-linear resistance and the life property.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Also, by making the content ratio of Bi2 O3 to NiO a mole ratio of 0.5 or more but 1.5 or less, and the content ratio of MnO to Sb2 O3 a mole ratio of 1.0 or less, it becomes possible to improve the non-linear resistance property and the life property.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the moisture resistance property of the non-linear resistor can also be improved simultaneously, and a stable varistor property can be obtained over a long period.
      <br/>
      In particular, a MnO/Sb2 O3 ratio of 0.9 or less is even more desirable.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Next, the manufacturing of the non-linear resistor will be explained hereinbelow.</p>
    <p num="29">
      These materials which form the principle and auxiliary compositions as well as water, organic dispersing agent, and binders are put into a mixer and then mixed and spray dried into granulated powders.
      <br/>
      Then, such granulated powders are filled in a mold to be pressed, so that a disk-shaped molding is formed.
      <br/>
      Then, a pressed body is heated to remove the binder and then sintered to form the sintered body at temperatures known to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The following are descriptions in more concrete terms of preferred embodiments of the present invention, with reference to the below-mentioned embodiments and comparative examples.</p>
    <p num="31">EMBODIMENT 1</p>
    <p num="32">
      Raw material mixtures were prepared by weighing and mixing specified quantities of Bi2 O3, NiO, Sb2 O3, MnO and Co2 O3, as auxiliary compositions, with ZnO powder, as the principal composition such that the auxiliary composition contents in the ultimately obtained non-linear resistor became the values shown in Table 1 to Table 6.
      <br/>
      ZnO is the balance of the mol %. Uniform slurries were respectively prepared by adding water, dispersion material and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), as an organic binder, to the obtained raw material mixtures and placing in mixers.
      <br/>
      Next, granular powders of grain diameter 100  MU m were prepared by spray granulation of the obtained slurries with a spray drier.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The obtained granulated powders were respectively formed into disc-shaped moldings by pressure molding using a die press.
      <br/>
      Then, the molded bodies had the binder removed by heating in air at 500 (degree)  C. and, after the organic binder, etc., had been eradicated, they are were sintered in air at a temperature of 1200 (degree)  C. for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      Non-linear resistor test samples of diameter 20 mm * thickness 2 mm were respectively prepared by performing a grinding process on the surfaces of the obtained sintered bodies.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 1, a high-resistance layer (side insulation layer) 2 is formed on the side surface of a non-linear resistor 1 for each test sample by coating a high-resistance insulating substance composed of a thermo-setting resin and then baking.
      <br/>
      Next, the non-linear resistor is produced by forming respective electrodes 3 by polishing the two end surfaces of a sintered body 1 and flame-coating aluminum on these two end surfaces.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The breakdown voltage and non-linear characteristics measurement results for each non-linear resistance element are shown in Table 1 to Table 6.
      <br/>
      Tables 1 to 3 show the effect on breakdown voltage and non-linear characteristics when the contained quantities of auxiliary compositions Bi2 O3, NiO, Sb2 O3, MnO and Co2 O3 are changed.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, Tables 4 to 6 show the effect on breakdown voltage and non-linear characteristics when the content ratio of Bi2 O3 and NiO is changed.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      As is clear from the results shown in Tables 1 to 6, most compositions using non-linear resistor relating to this embodiment, proved to have preferred high breakdown voltages of 600 V/mm or higher and to possess superior surge current withstand.
      <br/>
      Here, the meaning of the breakdown voltage is the same as the varistor voltage.
      <br/>
      Also, the V10kA /V1mA values, which indicate the current/voltage non-linear characteristics, displayed superior values compared to the prior art examples, becoming 1.50 or less, preferably 1.40 or less.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention demonstrates that it is possible to increase the amount of surge current that can be withstood and, in particular, that the sintered body of the present invention may also be used effectively in small lightning arresters as surge absorbers.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Next, in further embodiments the effect that the addition and amount of Al3+, B3+ Ag+, Na+, K+, Cl- and Ca2+, selectively added to a non-linear resistor, exert on the breakdown voltage and non-linear characteristics of the non-linear resistor are explained based on the description of Embodiment 2 and Embodiment 3.</p>
    <p num="38">EMBODIMENT 2</p>
    <p num="39">In the embodiment of the present invention, the resistor having non-linear resistance can contain one or more of Al3+ generally in an amount of from 0.5. to 500 ppm, B3+ generally in an amount of from 10 to 1000 ppm and Ag+ generally in an amount of from 10 to 1000 ppm.</p>
    <p num="40">
      A raw material mixture was prepared by mixing a specified quantity of each of Bi2 O3, NiO, Sb2 O3, MnO and Co2 O3, as auxiliary compositions, into ZnO powder, as the principal composition such that a non-linear resistor had a basic composition containing 0.6 mol % of Bi2 O3, 1.0 mol % of Co2 O3, 1.0 mol % of Sb2 O3, 0.9 mol % of MnO and 0.4 mol % of NiO.
      <br/>
      Then, a uniform slurry is prepared by mixing water with this raw material mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      First, specified quantities of an aqueous solution of aluminum nitrate were added to the above slurry such that aluminum converted to Al3+, contained as an auxiliary composition in the non-linear resistor, were in the respective contents shown in Table 7.
      <br/>
      Then, raw material slurries were prepared by adding dispersion materials and organic binders, and mixing in mixers.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, non-linear resistor Test Samples 128 to 135 were respectively prepared by performing granulation, pressure-molding, removing the binder and sintering, following the same production method as for Embodiment 1.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Second, specified quantities of an aqueous solution of boric acid were added to the above slurry such that boron converted to B3+ contained as an auxiliary composition in the non-linear resistor, were in the respective contents shown in Table 7.
      <br/>
      Then, raw material slurries were prepared by adding dispersion materials and organic binders, and mixing in mixers.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, non-linear resistor Test Samples 136 to 142 were respectively prepared by performing granulation, pressure-molding, removing the binder and sintering, following the same production method as for Embodiment 1.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Third, specified quantities of an aqueous solution of silver nitrate were added to the above slurry such that silver converted to Ag+ contained as an auxiliary composition in the non-linear resistor, were in the respective contents shown in Table 7.
      <br/>
      Then, raw material slurries were prepared by adding dispersion materials and organic binders, and mixing in mixers.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, non-linear resistor Test Samples 143 to 149 were respectively prepared by performing granulation, pressure-molding, heating to remove the binder and sintering, following the same production method as for Embodiment 1.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Table 7 below shows the results of measuring breakdown voltages and non-linear resistance characteristics following the same measurement methods as for Embodiment 1 and using the non-linear resistor of Test Samples 128 to 149, prepared in the above way.</p>
    <p num="45">
      As is clear from the results shown in Table 7, it has been possible to confirm that the non-linear resistor relating to this embodiment that contained A3+, B3+ or Ag+ within the preferred ranges, compared with the resistor outside the above ranges, obtained relatively high values for breakdown voltage of 600 V/mm or higher, and possessed superior surge current withstand.
      <br/>
      Also, it is shown that the V10kA /V1ma values that indicate the current/voltage non-linear characteristics are considerably improved, becoming 1.40 or less.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In other words, at the same time, Al3+ is a composition that can greatly improve the non-linear resistor by the addition of a relatively small quantity, preferably 0.5 to 500 ppm.
      <br/>
      If the content exceeds 500 ppm, it will, on the contrary, cause the non-linear resistance to deteriorate, and thus would not be as preferable.
      <br/>
      Because improvements in properties can be obtained with an extremely small quantity of the Al3+ composition, it is preferable to add it to, and mix it with, the raw material system as an aqueous solution of a compound that is readily soluble in water, such as a nitrate.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Also, with regard to the basic composition disclosed in the first embodiment, by the inclusion of a small amount, preferably 10 to 1000 ppm respectively, of at least one or more of boron (B) and silver (Ag), converted to B3+ and Ag+ it is possible to improve non-linear resistance and the life property.
      <br/>
      Direct current (DC) life, in particular, greatly improves.
      <br/>
      That is to say, a resistor made from the basic compositions alone, while useful, has the disadvantages in which the leak current increases with the passage of time when DC is applied, thermal runaway occurs, and use for DC is generally not desirable.
      <br/>
      However, by the inclusion of 10 to 1000 ppm of at least one or both of boron (B) and silver (Ag), converted to B3+ and Ag+ the variation with time of the leak current reduces, and therefore the DC life property improves dramatically.
      <br/>
      Here, the DC life property means the property of the non-linear resistance when the current applied to the non-linear resistor is DC.
      <br/>
      If the content is less than 10 ppm, no effect of the addition is exhibited, but by adding 10 ppm or more, the DC life property, in particular, improves.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the content exceeds 1000 ppm, on the contrary, not only will the DC life property deteriorate, the deterioration will also extend to the AC life and the non-linear property.
      <br/>
      Thus, a preferred aspect of the invention includes 10 to 1000 ppm of one or more of B3+ and Ag+.

      A raw material mixture was prepared by mixing a specified quantity of each of Bi2 O3, Co2 O3, Sb2 O3, MnO and NiO, as auxiliary compositions, into ZnO powder, as the principal composition such that the non-linear resistor should have a basic composition containing 0.6 mol % of Bi2 O3, 1.0 mol % of Co2 O3, 1.0 mol % of Sb2 O3, 0.9 mol % of MnO and 0.4 mol % of NiO.

      Then, raw material slurries were prepared by adding dispersion materials and organic binders, and mixing in mixers.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, non-linear resistor Test Samples 166 to 173 were respectively prepared by performing granulation, pressure-molding, heating to remove the binder and sintering, following the same production method as for Embodiment 1.

    <p num="53">
      Fourth, specified quantities of an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide were added to the above slurry such that the calcium converted to Ca2+ contained as an auxiliary composition in the non-linear resistor, were in the respective contents shown in Table 8.
      <br/>
      Then, raw material slurries were prepared by adding dispersion materials and organic binders, and mixing in mixers.

      Thereafter, non-linear resistor Test Samples 174 to 181 were respectively prepared by performing granulation, pressure-molding, heating to remove the binder and sintering, following the same production method as for Embodiment 1.

    <p num="54">Table 8 shows the results of measuring breakdown voltages and non-linear resistance characteristics following the same measurement methods as for Embodiment 1 and using the non-linear resistance of Test Samples 150 to 181, prepared in the above way.</p>
    <p num="55">
      As is clear from the results shown in Table 8, it has been possible to confirm that the non-linear resistor relating to this embodiment that contained one or more of Na+, K+, Cl- and Ca2+, within the preferred ranges, compared with the resistance outside the preferred ranges, obtained relatively high values for breakdown voltage of 600 V/mm or higher, and possessed superior surge current withstand.
      <br/>
      Also, it is shown that the V10kA /V1mA values that indicate the current/voltage non-linear characteristics are considerably improved, becoming 1.40 or less.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      In the above Embodiment 2 and Embodiment 3, the descriptions have been given taking as examples non-linear resistor having basic compositions such that they contain 0.6 mol % of Bi2 O3, 1.0 mol % of Co2 O3, 1.0 mol % of Sb2 O3, 0.9 mol % of MnO and 0.4 mol % of NiO as auxiliary compositions.
      <br/>
      However, it has been confirmed that results in which the non-linear resistance characteristics and the surge current withstand are improved are also obtained with non-linear resistor that contain bismuth, cobalt, antimony, manganese and nickel respectively converted to Bi2 O3, Co2 O3, Sb2 O3, MnO and NiO as 0.05 to 10.0 mol % of Bi2 O3, 0.05 to 10.0 mol % of Co2 O3, 0.05 to 10.0 mol % of Sb2 O3, 0.05 to 10.0 mol % of MnO and 0.05 to 10.0 mol % of NiO; the content ratio of Bi2 O3 to the said NiO being in a mole ratio of 0.5 or more but 1.5 or less, and the content ratio of MnO to Sb2 O3 being in a mole ratio of 1.0 or less.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      In other words, sodium (Na), potassium (K), chlorine (Cl) and calcium (Ca), of which at least one is selectively added as an auxiliary composition, are also effective for improving the non-linear property and the life property, and they are included within the preferred ranges of 0.01 to 1000 ppm.
      <br/>
      Generally, when this content is less than 0.01 ppm, the above improvement effect reduces, while with quantities exceeding 1000 ppm, the non-linear property is, on the contrary, reduced and thus compositions outside of this range, while still within the scope of the present invention, are not as preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      When using the non-linear resistor relating to the present invention, as described above, it contains zinc oxide and the principal composition and bismuth, cobalt, antimony, manganese and nickel as auxiliary compositions.
      <br/>
      The content ratio of Bi2 O3 to NiO is generally in the range of 0.5 to 1.5, while the content ratio of MnO to Sb2 O3 is generally 1.0 or less.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to provide a non-linear resistor with a superior current/voltage non-linear resistance characteristics and also a high withstand-voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="59">As shown above by the further inclusion of specified quantities of aluminum, boron, silver, sodium, potassium, chlorine or calcium, the non-linear resistance characteristics and the surge current withstand can be further improved.</p>
    <p num="60">
      When using a non-linear resistor having the basic composition according to the present invention, it is generally desirable to make the particle diameter of the zinc oxide (ZnO) crystal grains which are the principal composition, extremely fine, for example, at 2 to 5  MU m average particle size.
      <br/>
      In addition, as well as being able to make the grain size distribution of the ZnO crystal grains extremely even, a fine particle diameter permits the size of the ZnO crystal grain interface to be finer.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The resistance value of the non-linear resistor is determined by the inverse of the number of grain boundaries per unit composition, that is to say, by the grain size of the ZnO crystal grains.
      <br/>
      Therefore, by making the grain size of the ZnO crystal grains finer according to a preferred aspect of the invention, the resistance value, that is to say the withstand-voltage value, of the non-linear resistor can be raised.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Also, the current/voltage property of a non-linear resistor is manifested at the grain boundaries of the ZnO crystal grains.
      <br/>
      When using the preferred aspect of the invention of the present application, a more uniform interface is formed by the grain size distribution of the ZnO crystal grains being made uniform and the size of the interface being made finer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the current/voltage property will improve.
