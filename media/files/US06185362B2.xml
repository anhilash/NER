    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a digital camcorder, and more specifically, to a digital camcorder which has an automatic select function for selecting an audio signal output channel.
      <br/>
      The present invention also relates to a recording/reproducing method of the audio signals.
      <br/>
      In the recording/reproducing method, a dubbing flag is inserted into a sub-code during a dubbing mode, and the sub-code is read during a playback mode, with a result that the audio signals of a sub-channel are automatically selected and output if a dubbing flag is detected, and the audio signals of a main channel are selected and output when there are no dubbing flags detected.
      <br/>
      The present invention is based on Korean Application No. 97-2875, which is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      In digital and analog camcorders, audio signals may be recorded on a recording media during a shooting mode and during a dubbing mode.
      <br/>
      During the shooting mode, video signals are shot and audio signals in the shooting area are recorded at the same time.
      <br/>
      During the dubbing mode, audio signals, in addition to the audio signals recorded during the shooting mode, are artificially recorded.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      There are differences between the tape-recording methods of analog and digital camcorders.
      <br/>
      That is, in analog camcorders, the audio signals of the shooting scenes are recorded in the audio channel on a recording tape during the shooting mode, and then these audio signals are erased and other audio signals are recorded in the audio channel during the dubbing mode.
      <br/>
      However, in digital camcorders, there is a main audio channel and a separate sub-audio channel.
      <br/>
      The main audio channel is the recording channel of the audio signals on the shooting scenes, and the sub-audio channel is the recording channel for additional audio signals such as background music.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventional digital camcorders have a disadvantage in that users must manually choose the channels.
      <br/>
      Moreover, users cannot easily find the exact timing when users play back the audio signals of the main channel recorded when photographing or those of the sub-channel recorded when dubbing, or when users play back the audio signals of the main and sub-channel simultaneously.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      To solve the above problems of the conventional digital camcorders, it is an object of the present invention to provide a digital camcorder which has an automatic select function for automatically selecting an audio signal output channel.
      <br/>
      After dubbing flags are inserted to a sub-code area during a dubbing mode and the sub-codes are read during a playback mode, the audio signals of a sub-channel are chosen when there are dubbing flags, and the audio signals of a main channel are chosen when there are no dubbing flags.
    </p>
    <p num="6">It is another object of the present invention to provide an audio signal recording method.</p>
    <p num="7">It is still another object of the present invention to provide an audio signal playback method.</p>
    <p num="8">In order to accomplish the first object of the present invention, there is provided a digital camcorder having an audio signal output channel which records audio signals on shooting scenes and dubs audio signals respectively in a main channel and a sub-channel according to a shooting mode or a dubbing mode during recording, and outputs the audio signals recorded in the main channel and the sub-channel during playback, the digital camcorder comprising an operating portion for applying an operation command of the playback mode or the shooting/dubbing mode; an audio input/output portion for inputting/outputting the audio signals; a channel select portion for selecting a channel for recording audio signals input during recording and a channel for outputting the audio signals during playback; an error correction coding/decoding portion for inserting a dubbing flag according to a dubbing flag insertion command during recording and for detecting the dubbing flag according to a dubbing flag detection command during playback; and a controlling portion for applying the dubbing flag insertion command to the error correction coding/decoding portion during the dubbing mode during recording and for applying the dubbing flag detection command to the error correction coding/decoding portion during playback, according to an operational command supplied by the operating portion, thereby controlling the channel select portion according to the existence of the dubbing flag detected.</p>
    <p num="9">Preferably, the dubbing flag is inserted in a sub-code area of a recording tape when the audio signals are recorded in the sub-channel.</p>
    <p num="10">Preferably, the controlling portion controls the audio signals recorded in the sub-channel to be output when the dubbing flag is detected during playback and controls the audio signals recorded in the main channel to be output when the dubbing flag is not detected.</p>
    <p num="11">To achieve the second object, there is provided method of recording audio signals in a digital camcorder, comprising the steps of (a) determining whether a set recording mode is a dubbing mode or a shooting mode; (b) inserting a dubbing flag and recording the audio signals in a sub-channel if the set recording mode is determined in step (a) to be the dubbing mode; (c) recording the audio signals in the main channel if the set recording mode is determined in the step (a) to be a shooting mode; (d) determining whether the recording is finished; and (e) returning to the step (a) if the recording is not finished, and ending the method if the recording is finished.</p>
    <p num="12">To achieve the third object, there is provided a method of playing back audio signals recorded in each channel in a digital camcorder, comprising the steps of (a) determining whether a dubbing flag is detected during playback; (b) outputting audio signals of a sub-channel when the dubbing flag is detected in the step (a) and audio signals of a main channel when the dubbing flag is not detected in the step (a); (c) determining whether the playback is finished; and (d) returning to the step (a) if the playback is not finished, and ending the method if the playback is finished.</p>

      FIG. 3C illustrates the form of the audio signals which are output during the playback mode of the digital camcorder according to the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 4 is a view illustrating the structure of one track in which the data is recorded in the digital camcorder.
      <br/>
      Information which is stored in one track is divided into a video signal region 40, an audio signal region 42 and a sub-code region 44.
      <br/>
      In the sub-code region 44, application information such as the time of a current track, the track information, the dubbing flags and so on is stored.
      <br/>
      The audio signal region 42 includes the main channel in which the audio signals are recorded during shooting and the sub-channel in which the audio signals are recorded during dubbing.
    </p>
    <p num="33">The recording and playback operations in the digital camcorder illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 will be described with reference to FIGS. 3A, 3B, 3C and 4.</p>
    <p num="34">First, in the recording operation, if a predetermined command, that is, a shooting or dubbing command is applied from an operating portion 100, the controlling portion 102 outputs the controlling signal for selecting a channel and applies a command for inserting a dubbing flag only in the case that the dubbing command is applied.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The channel select portion 106 selects the main channel or the sub-channel according to the controlling signals input from the controlling portion 102 and outputs the signals input from the audio input portion 104.
      <br/>
      In the compression portion 108, the audio signals stored in the channel selected by the channel select portion 106 are compressed.
      <br/>
      In the error correction coding portion 110, an error correction code of the audio signals output from the compression portion 108 is produced.
      <br/>
      When a dubbing flag insertion command from the controlling portion 102 is applied to the error correction coding portion 110, a dubbing flag is inserted.
      <br/>
      That is, dubbing flag information is inserted in the sub-code region 44, illustrated in FIG. 4.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In the modulation portion 112, the audio signals output from the error correction coding portion 110 are modulated.
      <br/>
      In the amplification portion 114, the modulated audio signals are amplified to a predetermined level and the audio signals are recorded on a recording tape by the recording head 116.
      <br/>
      That is, the audio signals input during the shooting mode are recorded in the main channel and the audio signals input during the dubbing mode are recorded in the sub-channel, as illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In addition, when a playback operation of the tape recorded as described above is performed, the audio signals of the main channel and the sub-channel, which are read from the tape by the playback head 122, are amplified to a predetermined level by the amplification portion 124.
      <br/>
      The amplified audio signals are demodulated by the demodulation portion 126.
      <br/>
      The demodulated signals are error-corrected by the error correction decoding portion 128.
      <br/>
      Here, the error correction decoding portion 128 detects whether a dubbing flag exists.
      <br/>
      If a dubbing flag exists, the controlling signal is output from the controlling portion 130.
      <br/>
      At this time, the channel select portion 134, which receives the audio signals stored in each channel decompressed by the decompression portion 132, outputs only the audio signals of the channel selected by the controlling signal output from the controlling portion 130 to the audio output portion 136.
      <br/>
      That is, when the audio signals of the main channel are output according to the channel select signal output from the controlling portion 130, the audio signals recorded in the sub-channel are output by automatically selecting the sub-channel if the dubbing flag is detected, and then if no dubbing flag is detected, the audio signals of the main channel are output again.
    </p>
    <p num="38">FIG. 5 is a flowchart of the method of recording the audio signals in the digital camcorder according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="39">It is determined whether the recording mode is a dubbing or shooting mode (step 500).</p>
    <p num="40">
      In the result of the determination in step 500, if the mode is a dubbing mode, a dubbing flag is inserted (step 502) and the audio signals are recorded in the sub-channel (step 504).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the mode is a shooting mode, the audio signals are recorded in the main channel (step 506).
    </p>
    <p num="41">In the result of determining whether the recording is finished (step 508), the program will return to the determination step (step 500) if the recording is not finished, and the program ends if the recording is finished.</p>
    <p num="42">FIG. 6 is a flowchart of the method of playing back the audio signals recorded in each channel in the digital camcorder according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="43">During playback, it is determined whether the dubbing flags are detected (step 600).</p>
    <p num="44">In the determination result of step 600, the audio signals of the sub-channel are output if the dubbing flag is detected, and the audio signals of the main channel are output if the dubbing flag is not detected (step 604).</p>
    <p num="45">In the result of the playback operation (step 608), the program returns to step 600 if the playback is not finished, and the program ends if the playback is finished.</p>
    <p num="46">
      As described above, in the digital camcorder which has the automatic select function of the audio output channel and the corresponding recording/reproducing method according to the present invention, the dubbing flag is inserted during the dubbing mode during recording and the dubbing flag is detected during playback.
      <br/>
      Then, the output audio signals are automatically selected by means of the choice of the main channel and the sub-channel depending on the result of whether or not dubbing flags exist.
      <br/>
      Thus, this digital camcorder provides simplicity of operation in comparison with the conventional digital camcorder.
