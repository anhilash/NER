      The present invention is directed to a new class of excitatory amino acid antagonists and intermediates thereof.
      <br/>
      These new antagonists, heterocycle substituted propenoic acid derivatives, are useful as NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) antagonists.
      <br/>
      They preferentially bind to the strychnine-insensitive glycine binding site on the NMDA receptor complex associated with the treatment of a number of disease states.
      <br/>
      Another aspect of the invention is directed to their use in treatment of a number of diseases as well as to pharmaceutical compositions containing these excitatory amino acid antagonists.

      The incubation/resuspension/centrifugation process is repeated an additional 2 times and the final pellet is resuspended in 6 volumes of 50 mM HEPES-KOH at pH 7.4.

      Specific binding of �3 H�-glycine is measured as the total radioactivity bound minus that bound to the receptors in the presence of 0.1 mM M D-serine.

      Total membrane-bound radioactivity is less that 2% of that added to the assay vials.

      Since these conditions limit the total binding to less than 10% of the radioactivity, the concentration of free ligand does not change appreciably during the assay.

      Male Sprague-Dawley rats are subjected to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery by an adaptation of the method of H. Memezawa et al., Ischemia Penumbra in a Model of Reversible Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Rat, Experimental Brain Research, 89, 67-78 (1992).

      Two ties are placed on the external carotid artery.

      The internal carotid artery is exposed distally to the point of its bifurcation into the intracranial internal carotid artery and the pterygopalatine artery.
      <br/>
      A small cut is made in the distal segment of the external carotid artery and a 3-0 nylon monofilament is introduced into the lumen of the external carotid artery.
      <br/>
      The two previously placed ties are tightened around the monofilament.
      <br/>
      The external carotid artery is cut and reflected caudally so that the monofilament can be advanced into the internal carotid artery, past the distal internal carotid artery/pterygopalatine artery bifurcation and continuing into the intranial segment of the internal carotid artery to a distance of 20 mm, at which point the origin of the middle cerebral artery is occluded.

      Using a Foredom micro drill with a 4 mm burr bit, a small (approximately 8 mm) hole is made in the skull directly above the middle carotid artery.
