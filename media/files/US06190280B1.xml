    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a multispeed mechanical transmission with an optional hydrostatic attachment, useful in, but not limited to agricultural tractors.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The prior art is replete with various transmissions for agricultural tractors and the like.
      <br/>
      Multispeed transmissions having countershafts are widely used in the power train of tractor arrangements because a plurality of rotating clutch assemblies and associated gears can be positioned on parallel shafts to allow considerable flexibility in adapting them to different space requirements and "gear spacing".
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      "Gear spacing" is the ratio change between gears which produces the change in vehicle speed when the operator shifts to a different gear.
      <br/>
      The smaller this gear spacing the better the optimum engine speed can be matched to the optimum ground speed.
      <br/>
      The more gear selections that are available, the finer the gear spacing can be designed.
      <br/>
      However, the number of clutches and gears increases with added gear selections, increasing the cost, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      "Shift quality" is the operator's perception of how smoothly a transmission reacts when making a shift.
      <br/>
      Many factors affect shift quality, such as rapid changes in speed of elements with large inertia within the transmission, poor timing of the pressure control, large torque interruptions at heavy loads, large gear spacing, and most of all, the number of clutch "swaps" required from one gear selection to the next. (A single clutch swap is defined as the disengagement of one clutch and the engagement of another clutch to complete a shift.) All currently manufactured powershift transmission have multiclutch swaps during some shifts in the operating range.
      <br/>
      It is difficult, if not impossible, to make multiclutch swaps smooth because during a shift, one or more of the engaging clutches opposes the direction of the shift.
      <br/>
      For example, in one typical transmission, during a triple clutch swap upshift from 6th to 7th gear, one of the clutches shifts up while the other two clutches shift down.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Any sequence of clutch engagements will cause torque reversals.
      <br/>
      This effect is inherent in all multiswap shifts of current designs.
      <br/>
      Only single clutch swaps can be shifted smoothly by overlapping the engagement of oncoming clutch with the disengagement of the outgoing clutch.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      There are special applications for the type of vehicle using the transmission described herein where exact speed control is important, such as trenching or certain planting and harvesting operations, among others.
      <br/>
      In many of these applications, most of the engine power is used to drive the mechanism of the towed attachment through the power take off (PTO) with only part of the power used for the forward motion of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Here, transmission efficiency is of secondary importance, with the primary importance being the ability to vary the ground speed at small increments independently of the engine.
      <br/>
      In such cases, an continuously variable transmission is desirable.
      <br/>
      Continuous variability can be achieved, for example, through the use of hydrostatic units, in which case, transmission efficiency is sacrificed.
      <br/>
      Other continuously variable transmissions include electrical generator-motor sets or variable friction drives.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Two types of the continuously variable transmission are of interest:</p>
    <p num="9">
      1.
      <br/>
      Continuous variability from a certain minimum vehicle speed to the maximum vehicle speed with full power transmission capability in one mode of operation, and continuous variability from zero to a certain low vehicle speed with maximum traction capability in another mode of operation.
      <br/>
      In the full power mode a means (such as a clutch) must be available to start the vehicle in motion at full load.
      <br/>
      As pertains to the present invention, this type will be called a partial continuously variable transmission (PCVT).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      2. Continuous variability from zero to maximum vehicle speed with full power and maximum traction capability within a single mode of operation.
      <br/>
      As pertains to the present invention, this type will be called a full continuously variable transmission (FCVT).

    <p num="11">
      It is the object of the present invention to provide the largest known number of gear selections with a given number of clutches.
      <br/>
      For example, current transmissions with 9 clutches provide between 16 and 18 speeds forward with 4 to 6 reverse speeds.
      <br/>
      A typical arrangement of the present invention provides 23 forward and 8 reverse speeds using 9 clutches.
      <br/>
      These five extra speeds allow a closer gear spacing.
    </p>
    <p num="12">It is a further object of this invention to provide a variety of transmission systems from which to choose for specific applications.</p>
    <p num="13">
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide single clutch swaps for all single step and double step shifts throughout the normal operating range.
      <br/>
      Single step means sequential shifts and double step means skipping a gear selection.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      It is a further object of the present invention to maximize the efficiency by keeping the number of gear meshes low.
      <br/>
      Also, the clutch sizes and speeds can be minimized for low losses.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide continuous variability of the type PCVT via an optional attachment.
      <br/>
      In this case, the present invention proposes the use of modulated clutches for starting the vehicle motion, thus allowing for the use of relatively small hydrostatic units.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide an alternate transmission system with continuous variability of the type FCVT.
      <br/>
      A continuously variable transmission from zero to maximum vehicle speed is realized by making the hydrostatic units large enough for sufficient torque to start the vehicle motion.
    </p>
    <p num="17">It is a further object of this invention to provide a compact transmission package using a unique gear, shaft, clutch and bearing arrangement.</p>
    <p num="18">General Description of the Basic Powershift Transmission</p>
    <p num="19">
      "Transmission" as used in this document is an arrangement of gears, shafts, clutches and bearings located in a housing for the purpose of transmitting rotational power, "input" meaning power absorbing, "output" meaning power delivering.
      <br/>
      The transmission system consists of an input transmission, a compound planetary system and an output transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A compound planetary system is a planetary system consisting of at least two simple planetaries.(FIGS. 16, 17 and 18) There are two kinds of simple planetaries, the single and the double planetary.
      <br/>
      These are defined as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A single planetary is comprised of a internal ring gear, a sun gear and a set of planets (usually three) which are rotatably mounted on sets of shafts anchored in a planet carrier.
      <br/>
      Each planet gear is in mesh with the ring gear and with the sun gear thus acting as an idler gear between the ring and the sun gear.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A double planetary is comprised of an internal ring gear, a sun gear and two sets of planet gears which are rotatably mounted on two sets of shafts each set of shafts being anchored in a planet carrier.
      <br/>
      One set of planets is in mesh with the ring gear and with the other set of planets which in turn is in mesh with the sun gear.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Another type of compound planetary system uses cluster planet gears. (as schematically represented in FIGS. 19, 20 and 21) Usually an equivalent planetary system of the first type described above can be constructed.
      <br/>
      The input transmission has one input member connected to the engine or motor and two output members each of which is selectively connectable to the input member by clutches through various gear ratios in forward and reverse.
      <br/>
      The output members are connected to the two input members of the compound planetary system.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The compound planetary system has two input members connected to the input transmission (as stated in the previous paragraph) and two output members connected to the output transmission.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The output transmission has two input members connected to two output members of the planetary system (as stated in the previous paragraph) and one output member connected to the rear and/or to the front wheel drive of the tractor.
      <br/>
      The output member is selectively connectable by clutches through various gear ratios to each of the two input members.
      <br/>
      Various accessory drives can be included wherever convenient to the input and output transmission.

    <p num="27">Description of One Typical Embodiment of the Basic Powershift Transmission</p>
    <p num="28">
      In what follows, a specific transmission system (shown in FIG. 1) is described.
      <br/>
      It is understood, however, that the invention is not limited to this specific example.
      <br/>
      The compound planetary system consists of one ring gear R, two sun gears, S1 and S2, and one planet carrier C on which two sets of planets, Pi and PO, are rotatably mounted by two sets of shafts.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The input transmission of this system has two sets of three clutches.
      <br/>
      One set, denoted F, REV, and B, selectively connects the input shaft to the R shaft through various gears or it stops the R shaft.
      <br/>
      The other set, denoted f, rev, and b, selectively connects the input shaft to the S1 shaft through various gears or it stops the S1 shaft.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The output transmission has two sets of clutches.
      <br/>
      One set, denoted 1, 3, and 5, selectively connects the output shaft to the C shaft through three corresponding gear ratios.
      <br/>
      The other set, denoted 2, 4, and 6, selectively connects the output shaft to the S2 shaft through three corresponding gear ratios.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The compound planetary systems shown in FIGS. 16, 17, 18 and 25 is incorporated in FIGS. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 14.
      <br/>
      It is comprised of a single input planetary Pi and a double output planetary PO.
      <br/>
      The members of the two planetaries are connected as shown: The ring gear R of the planetary Pi is connected to the ring gear of the planetary PO, the carrier of the planetary Pi is connected to the carrier C of the planetary PO.
      <br/>
      The two input connections, R and S1, are attached to the ring gear and to the sun gear of the planetary Pi, respectively, and the two output connections, C and S2, are attached to the carrier and the sun gear of the output planetary PO, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The compound planetary system has the following characteristics:</p>
    <p num="33">
      1.
      <br/>
      The ratio of speeds of any two of the four members (two input and two output members) determines the ratio of speeds of all members to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="34">2. At a constant speed of one input member (the ring gear R), as the other input member (the sun gear S1) is varied from a negative speed to zero to a positive speed, the speed of one output member (sun gear S2) decreases and the speed of the other output member (planet carrier C) increases. (Of course, as the sun gear S1 is varied from a positive speed to zero to a negative speed, the speed of S2 increases and the speed of C decreases.)</p>

      <br/>
      The gears on the right are in mesh with the gears of the second planet set PO.

    <p num="44">In the following description power flow may be positive or negative.</p>
    <p num="45">
      The input transmission absorbs engine power through the input shaft, transmitting power selectively through two pairs of clutches to the two input members, S1 and R, of the compound planetary.
      <br/>
      The first pair of clutches is denoted f and F, and the second pair is denoted rev and REV.
    </p>
    <p num="46">The first pair of clutches is mounted on the input shaft to selectively drive the ring gear R through clutch F, via a gear set 34F to 42, and to selectively drive the sun gear S1 through clutch f, via a gear set 23f to 53.</p>
    <p num="47">
      The second pair of clutches is mounted on the reverse shaft.
      <br/>
      This shaft is driven through a 41 to 41r gear set from the input shaft.
      <br/>
      The reverse shaft is located such that the 34Rev gear is in mesh with the 42 gear and the 23rev gear is in mesh with the 53 gear.
      <br/>
      Thus, the selective engagement of the clutches REV and rev will respectively drive the ring gear R and the sun gear S1 in the opposite direction at the same speeds as the F and f clutches.
    </p>
    <p num="48">In addition to these two pairs of clutches, there are two clutches B and b. Engagement of B will stop the ring gear R and of b will stop the sun gear S1.</p>
    <p num="49">
      The output transmission absorbs power selectively through two shafts S2 and C. Power is transmitted through either one shaft or the other or through both shafts in certain proportions.
      <br/>
      The shafts of both S2 and C have clutches mounted on them which in combination with the clutches mounted on the output shaft provide three selective gear ratios each from S2 to the output shaft and from C to the output shaft.
      <br/>
      The even numbered clutches, 2, 4 and 6, selectively connect the S2 shaft to the output shaft at certain ratios provided by the gear sets 16(2) to 64(2), 30(4) to 50(4) and 48(6) to 33(6), respectively.
      <br/>
      The odd numbered clutches, 1, 3 and 5, selectively connect the C shaft to the output shaft at certain ratios provided by the gear sets 16(1) to 64(1), 30(3) to 50(3) and 48(5) to 33(5), respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="50">To establish a connection from the engine to the output shaft of the output transmission either:</p>
    <p num="51">
      (1) Two input clutches and one output clutch must be engaged, or
      <br/>
      (2) One input clutch and two output clutches must be engaged.
    </p>
    <p num="52">(1) Two input and one output clutches engaged:</p>
    <p num="53">
      Two input clutches are engaged, one driving the ring gear R at a certain ratio with respect to the engine, and one driving the sun gear S1 at a certain other or same ratio with respect to the engine, will establish a ratio of two members of the planetary system; also one input clutch F or REV driving the ring gear R with the sun gear S1 stopped (b engaged), or one input clutch f or r driving the sun gear S1 with the ring gear R stopped (B engaged), will establish a ratio of two members R and S1 of the planetary system.
      <br/>
      Then by Item (1) on page 4, the ratios of all members of the planetary system are established.
      <br/>
      Thus, the engagement of any one clutch (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) in the output transmission will establish an overall ratio from the input (engine) to the output of the transmission system.
    </p>
    <p num="54">(2) One input and two output clutches engaged:</p>
    <p num="55">
      Two output clutches engaged, with one of the clutches 2, 4, or 6 connecting the sun gear S2 to the output shaft of the output transmission at a certain ratio, and one of the clutches 1, 3, or 5 connecting the carrier C to the output shaft at a certain other or same ratio, will establish a ratio between S2 and C. Again, by Item (1) on page 4, the ratios of all members of the planetary system are established.
      <br/>
      Thus, the engagement of any one input clutch, F or Rev, which connects the engine to the ring gear R, or any one input clutch f or rev, which connects the engine to the sun gear S1, will establish a ratio from the engine to the output shaft of the transmission system.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Engaging the clutches as in either (1) or (2) above establishes a "gear" for the transmission system.
      <br/>
      The number of possible "gears" is the total number of possible combinations in (1) and (2).
      <br/>
      Thus,
      <br/>
      F and rev combined with 6 output clutches=6 forward "gears",
      <br/>
      REV and rev combined with 6 output clutches=6 reverse,
      <br/>
      F and b combined with 6 output clutches=6 forward,
      <br/>
      REV and b combined with 6 output clutches=6 reverse,
      <br/>
      F and f combined with 6 output clutches=6 forward,
      <br/>
      REV and f combined with 6 output clutches=6 reverse,
      <br/>
      f and B combined with 6 output clutches=6 forward, rev and B combined with 6 output clutches=6 reverse,
      <br/>
      F at input combined with 9* combinations at output=9 forward,
      <br/>
      REV at input combined with 9* combinations at output=9 reverse,
      <br/>
      f at input combined with 9* combinations at output=9 forward,
      <br/>
      rev at input combined with 9* combinations at output=9 reverse
    </p>
    <p num="57">* The 9 combinations at output are: 1-2, 1-4, 1-6, 2-3, 2-5, 3-4, 3-6, 4-5, 5-6.</p>
    <p num="58">Thus, there are 42 forward "gears" and 42 reverse "gears" possible in the transmission schematically illustrated in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="59">
      In order to provide single clutch swap shifts, a certain sequence of clutch combinations for each "gear" is chosen, as shown in column 2 of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      By selecting certain gear ratios for all gears in the system it is possible to provide reasonably equal geometric steps (11+ or -2 % shown as % speed change in column 9 in FIG. 2) from one gear selection to the next by choosing the sequence shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Note that some of the possible combinations of clutches are not used because they either provide redundant speeds or they will not fall within the single clutch swap sequence.
      <br/>
      Thus, from the 42 possible combinations available only 33 are used.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      FIG. 1 schematically illustrates the various clutches engaged in each gear selection (column 2) with the corresponding speeds of each shaft in the typical transmission described.
      <br/>
      Note the clutch REV and the clutch B are considered optional at added cost.
      <br/>
      The "standard" transmission has only 27 speeds forward and 9 speeds reverse.
      <br/>
      The addition of the clutch REV will make these 9 speeds reverse redundant.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a 27 speed forward and 27 speed reverse will result by adding the REV clutch.
      <br/>
      The addition of the clutch B will add 6 forward and 6 reverse speeds.
      <br/>
      These 6 speeds are the creep option for applications at very low vehicle speeds.

      <br/>
      For a "range shift" (meaning the sequential shift into a "gear" in which two output clutches are engaged), the single clutch swap shift is accomplished by matching the ratios in the output transmission and in the input transmission to the planetary system such that the speed ratios provided by the engagement of two output clutches and one input clutch (F) falls in between the speed ratios provided by the engagement of one of the two output clutches combined with two input clutches and (in between) the engagement of the other of the two output clutches combined with the same two input clutches.

      Thus, the engagement of the output clutches 1 and 2 combined with the input clutch F provides a speed ratio in between the engagement of output clutch 1 combined with input clutches F and f, and the engagement of output clutch 2 combined with the same input clutches F and f. Similarly, F 23 falls between F 2 r and F 3 r.

    <p num="80">General Description of the Continuously Variable (Hydrostatic) Options</p>
    <p num="81">
      In the description below the continuously variable element is referred to as the hydrostatic transmission.
      <br/>
      It is understood that other continuously variable system such as electrical generator-motor sets or variable friction drives could be used in place of hydrostatic units.
    </p>
    <p num="82">Two hydrostatic options are described below:</p>
    <p num="83">(1) Add-on option (PCVT):</p>
    <p num="84">
      A low cost option requiring relatively small hydrostatic units with minor changes on the transmission to install the units provides continuous variability over two ranges of operating speeds, one range from a certain low speed to maximum speed at ful power capacity and the other from a certain low reverse speed through zero to a certain low forward speed at full tractive load capacity.
      <br/>
      The first range requires the gradual engagement of a master clutch to start the vehicle motion, if the startup load is higher than say 53% of the vehicle weight. (53% of the weight is the amount for a specific example shown on Chart 1H line PH 1, 2) After the master clutch is fully engaged continuous variability over the full hydromechanical range from a certain low speed to maximum speed is available at full load or full power capacity.
      <br/>
      For the second range there are gear selections available which provide full load continuously variable capacity from a certain low reverse speed through zero to a certain low forward speed, but the vehicle must be stopped to shift from these low speed gear selections to the gear selection for the first range.
      <br/>
      On FIG. 3 schematically illustrates the gear selection for the first range are designated hydromechanical (HM) and for the second range pure hydrostatic (PH).
      <br/>
      Note a shift from the pure hydrostatic range PH 1, 2 to the hydromechanical range PM 1 or PM 2 can be made at the S1 speed of 1523.82 rpm by engaging the F clutch, which is at synchronism at this speed.
    </p>
    <p num="85">(2) Substitution option (FCVT):</p>
    <p num="86">Larger hydrostatic units can be added which provide full load startup capacity by gradually increasing the displacement of the variable hydrostatic unit, but due to the space limitations these units can not be used as an "add-on" feature to the standard powershift transmission.</p>
    <p num="87">Description of One Typical Embodiment of the PCVT (Add-On Option)</p>
    <p num="88">The transmission system consists of the powershift version as described above, with the addition of an continuously variable transmission, installed such that the input member S1 to the planetary system can be selectively connected to the engine through this continuously variable transmission.</p>
    <p num="89">
      In the description below a specific transmission system (shown in FIGS. 3, 4 and 5) is described for simplification.
      <br/>
      It is understood, however, that the invention is not limited to this specific example.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The system has two modes of operations: The mechanical powershift mode and the hydrostatic mode.
      <br/>
      The mechanical powershift mode is described above and will not be described here.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      The hydrostatic mode functions in the following manner.
      <br/>
      The input transmission of this system has two sets of three clutches.
      <br/>
      One set, denoted F, B, and Rev, selectively connects the input shaft to the R shaft through various gears, and the other set, denoted f, b, rev, selectively connects the input shaft to the S1 shaft through various gears.
      <br/>
      This set, f, b, rev, is inactive in the hydrostatic mode.
      <br/>
      In its place a fixed displacement hydrostatic unit (M) is connected to the S1 shaft by moving the shift collar (HM) rightward, and a variable displacement hydrostatic unit (P) is connected to the reverse shaft by moving the shift collar (HP) rightward.
    </p>
    <p num="92">The compound planetary system is described hereinabove.</p>
    <p num="93">
      In the following description the flow of power may be positive or negative.
      <br/>
      The input transmission absorbs engine power through the input shaft, transmitting power selectively through one of a set of clutches (F or REV) to the first input member R of the compound planetary.
      <br/>
      The clutch (F) is mounted on the input shaft to selectively drive the ring gear R, via a gear set 32(F) to 42.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      The clutch (REV) is mounted on the reverse shaft.
      <br/>
      This shaft is driven through a 46 to 46r gear set from the input shaft.
      <br/>
      The reverse shaft is located such that the 32(Rev) gear is in mesh with the 42 gear.
      <br/>
      Thus the selective engagement of the REV clutch will drive the ring gear R correspondingly in the opposite direction at the same speed as the F clutch.
      <br/>
      In addition to the two clutches (F and REV), there is the clutch B. Engagement of B will stop the ring gear R from rotation.
    </p>
    <p num="95">The sun gear S1 is driven by the hydrostatic transmission at a variable speed from a certain maximum reverse speed to a certain maximum forward speed.</p>
    <p num="96">
      The output transmission absorbs power selectively through two shafts S2 and C. The clutches mounted on the C-shaft and on the output shaft, provide two selective gear ratios from S2 to the output shaft and three selective gear ratios from C to the output shaft.
      <br/>
      The even numbered clutches 2 and 4 are selectively connecting the S2 shaft to the output shaft at ratios of 19(2) to 67(2), and 36(4) to 46(4), respectively.
      <br/>
      The odd numbered clutches 1, 3 and 5 are selectively connecting the C shaft to the output shaft at ratios of 19(1) to 67(1), 36(3) to 46(3) and 56(5) to 26(5), respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="97">To establish a connection from the engine to the output shaft of the output transmission either, one of the input clutches (F, B, or REV) plus the hydrostatic transmission in addition to one of the output clutches must be connected, or, two output clutches must be engaged plus either the hydrostatic transmission or one of the input clutches (F or REV).</p>
    <p num="98">
      Thus, there are four modes of operation:
      <br/>
      1.
      <br/>
      The low speed, pure hydrostatic (PH) mode with the clutch B engaged has five ranges, each providing continuous variability from a certain maximum reverse speed through zero speed to the same maximum forward speed as the hydrostatic transmission is varied from a maximum reverse speed through zero speed to the same maximum forward speed.
      <br/>
      To initially start the vehicle motion in this mode the clutch B and the output clutch for the particular maximum end speed are engaged after the hydrostatic transmission has been set to neutral (zero speed).
      <br/>
      Now the hydrostatic transmission can be moved to forward or reverse at any desired rate.
      <br/>
      2. The normal hydromechanical (HM) forward speed mode with the clutch F engaged has five ranges, each providing continuous variability from a certain minimum forward speed to a certain maximum forward speed as the hydrostatic transmission ratio is varied from a maximum speed in one direction through zero speed to a maximum speed in the other direction.
      <br/>
      To provide continuous variability over the total normal forward speed range a shift in the range transmission is made at the point of synchronism of two adjacent clutches. (The point of synchronism is the hydrostatic speed at which either of two output clutches provide the same system output speed.) Thus, starting with clutch 1 engaged, the hydrostatic transmission is varied from a maximum reverse speed through zero speed to a certain forward speed at which the relative speed in the friction elements of the clutch 2 is zero.
      <br/>
      At this point the shift from clutch 1 to clutch 2 is made.
      <br/>
      To further increase the vehicle speed the hydrostatic transmission is varied from the shiftpoint-speed back through zero to a certain reverse speed at which synchronous speed in clutch 3 is reached.
      <br/>
      At this point the shift from clutch 2 to clutch 3 is made.
      <br/>
      To further increase the vehicle speed the hydrostatic transmission is varied from the shiftpoint-speed back through zero to a certain forward speed, at which another range shift can be made at synchronism.
      <br/>
      From this progression it follows that the total vehicle speed range is continuously variable.
      <br/>
      It is assumed that sensors linked to a computer will sense the shiftpoint and perform the shift automatically.
      <br/>
      To initially start the vehicle motion a certain vehicle speed up to a certain maximum is preselected by the operator.
      <br/>
      Based on this selection the computer will set the hydrostatic unit, engage the F clutch and select the applicable output clutch (1 or 2).
      <br/>
      The output clutch pressure will be automatically modulated at a certain rate to provide a smooth transition from standstill to the preselected speed.
      <br/>
      Alternately the operator can override the automatic rate of modulation by pushing the clutch pedal to control the rate of clutch engagement at will.
      <br/>
      3. The normal HM reverse speed mode with the clutch REV engaged in place of the clutch F mirrors the normal forward speed mode.
      <br/>
      4. Two output clutches engaged with the hydrostatic transmission driving the input in the PH mode: There are 6 combinations of two output clutches engaged providing 6 continuously variable ranges from a maximum vehicle reverse speed through zero to a maximum vehicle forward speed.
      <br/>
      To initially start the vehicle motion in this mode both clutches for the particular maximum end speed are engaged after the hydrostatic transmission has been set to neutral (zero speed).
      <br/>
      Now the hydrostatic transmission can be moved into forward or reverse at any desired rate.
    </p>
    <p num="99">FIG. 4 schematically illustrates the various speeds within the transmission system at various input conditions.</p>
    <p num="100">
      Column 1 of FIG. 4 shows the mode of operation, either PH or HM.
      <br/>
      The PH modes provide an continuously variable range from the maximum vehicle forward speed, indicated in column 8, through zero to the same maximum vehicle reverse speed.
      <br/>
      The HM modes provide continuous variability from the lowest speed (2.93 kph) to the highest speed (40.95 kph), however, range shifts are required at the shift points.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      Column 2 of FIG. 4 indicates these shift points at the speeds wherever one or another output clutch is shown on the same line.
      <br/>
      In order to provide reverse speeds in the hydromechanical mode the reverse clutch REV must be engaged in place of the forward clutch F.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      Column 3 of FIG. 4 shows the speeds of the S1 shaft (fixed hydrostatic unit) required to provide the output speeds shown in column 7.
      <br/>
      The speed of the fixed unit M is varied by changing the output flow of the variable unit P. In the specific example the variable hydrostatic unit P connected to the reverse shaft has the same maximum displacement per revolution as the fixed hydrostatic unit M. Since the variable unit runs at engine speed, the fixed unit M runs at about 90% of engine speed at maximum hydrostatic pressure (10% of the speed is lost due to leakage).
      <br/>
      Thus the maximum speeds shown in column 3 are at 1800 rpm.
      <br/>
      Note: the shiftpoint speeds are at about 1500 rpm.
      <br/>
      It is assumed that speed sensors linked to a computer will perform the shift, thus the operator will not be aware of the change from one range to the next.
    </p>
    <p num="103">Columns 4 through 6 of FIG. 4 show the speeds of the members in the planetary system.</p>
    <p num="104">
      Column 9 shows the ratio of the available drawbar pull to the traction limit of the machine with sufficiently large hydrostatic units to transmit full engine power in the HM mode.
      <br/>
      The PH modes, however, show relatively low ratios.
      <br/>
      Only at maximum vehicle speeds of less than 3.14 kph is the pull to traction ratio greater than 1.
      <br/>
      This implies that a synchronous shift from the PH mode to the HM mode can not be made at maximum tractive load since this shift must be made from the clutch selection 1, 2.
      <br/>
      As evident from a review of Column 2 of FIG. 2, a shift made from the clutch selection 1, 2 only provides a pull of 53% (column 9) of traction.
      <br/>
      Therefore a high energy clutch must be gradually engaged to start the vehicle motion in a preselected hydromechanical range whenever the ratio of pull to traction is greater than 0.53. Thus, if there is no need to pick up the load hydrostatically from standstill of the vehicle, then a small hydrostatic transmission is sufficient.
      <br/>
      Since large clutches with modulation capability are required for the powershift version of the transmission system they can also be utilized as energy absorbing clutches for the hydrostatic version to start the vehicle motion by modulation.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Column 10 of FIG. 4 shows the ratio of the available drawbar pull to the traction limit with sufficiently large hydrostatic units to provide a ratio of 1.30 in the pure hydrostatic selection 1,2.
      <br/>
      From this selection a synchronous shift can be made at 1523.81 rpm by engaging the clutch F and then disengaging the clutch 1.
      <br/>
      Thus a continuously variable transmission (CVT) results.

      In this system the f, rev, b, and the B clutches with their corresponding gears have been removed from the input transmission of the powershift version.

      In their place a gear set (22, 34) to drive the hydrostatic unit M has been added and the gear ratio (36, 55) to drive the reverse shaft has been added, plus the REV gear 22REV has been added.
      <br/>
      In effect the displacement of the hydrostatic units has been increased due to their higher operating speed with respect to the units mounted as shown on FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Additionally the displacement per revolution must be increased to provide sufficient hydrostatic torque for the traction limit of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="110">FIG. 7 schematically represents that the CVT can operate at any speed from 0 to 40.95 kph. There are 4 shift points as indicated in column 2 wherever one or another output clutch are shown on the same line.</p>
    <p num="111">
      At these shift points a shift between the two clutches shown on the particular line can be made at synchronism.
      <br/>
      In other words either clutch will provide the same vehicle speed at the speed of the sun gear S1 indicated on the line (column 3 of FIG. 7).
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      Since the shifts can be made at synchronism all friction clutches could be replaced by jaw clutches.
      <br/>
      The choice becomes a matter of economics including the control system which must be more accurate to sense the speeds of synchronism.
      <br/>
      The friction clutches are more forgiving than the jaw clutches, however, they generate higher power losses thus affecting the efficiency adversely.
      <br/>
      The friction clutches can be made with fewer discs at higher clamping forces and lower cooling flow, since they need not absorb high energy and therefore the losses can be minimized.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      Column 10 on FIG. 7 indicates the effect of the larger hydrostatic units in the pure hydrostatic (PM) modes with respect to column 9 (smaller units).
      <br/>
      In column 10 the ratio of pull available to traction is greater than 1 (1.30), when the clutches 1 and 2 are engaged, thus the vehicle can reach the shiftpoint under the highest normal load condition.
      <br/>
      If for some reason the traction is unusually high, say the tires are frozen to the ground, the pure hydrostatic selection 14 can be made which will more than double the available pull (2.16), however, no synchronous shift can be made from this selection.
      <br/>
      The vehicle must be stopped, and 1, 2 must be selected for continuous variability from zero speed.

      It is an additional idea of this invention to design the input transmission such that the hydrostatic branch can be added as an option to a powershift transmission with either the hydrostatic mode or the powershift mode being selectable by the operator as described above.
      <br/>
      It is an additional idea to use a modulated clutch which is already present in the powershift version to start the vehicle motion from standstill rather than the hydrostatic transmission whenever the transmission system is started in the hydromechanical mode at high startup loads.
      <br/>
      Thus the hydrostatic units can be kept small since the high startup torque is not required making it physically possible to provide selectable modes of operation as described in the paragraph above.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      It is an additional idea to provide a full continuously variable transmission (FCVT) from maximum reverse through zero to maximum forward speed by using sufficiently large hydrostatic units without changes to the housings, planetary system and output transmission.
      <br/>
      This is possible because there exist synchronous speeds for the F clutch while operating in the pure hydrostatic mode at a point where the sun gear speed S1 is equal to the ring gear speed.

      FIG. 5 schematically represents a cross section of the transmission system for a vehicle design in which the transmission system is mounted to the rear frame with a relatively large space available at the input side of the transmission, thus the axial space available for the input transmission allows the use of pairs of clutches and the mounting of optional hydrostatic units at the input side of the transmission system.

      Further more this type of vehicle design requires the Power Take Off drive to be located across the top of the transmission with a pump drive to be located at the side of the transmission.

      The clutches are arranged such that the high feedback speed on the 22f and 22rev gears does not affect the clutch actuation, thus no dump valves are required which are normally used to deal with high clutch speeds.

    <p num="123">
      The output transmission is arranged such that the two high energy clutches (master clutches 1 and 2) with a large friction surface area and dual cooling flow are located on the output shaft where the torque is high.
      <br/>
      The low energy, low torque clutches 3 and 5 are located on one of the input shafts (C).
      <br/>
      The remaining clutch 4 uses the otherwise "dead" space on the output shaft below the bearing mounting of the S2 shaft.
      <br/>
      The three clutches 1, 2 and 4, located on the output shaft, are designed such that the actuating piston is rotating with the clutch gear to eliminate the effect of the high speed of the output shaft in the higher gear selections.
      <br/>
      This clutch design is described in the provisional application Ser.

      The input shaft (S2 shaft) of the output transmission is mounted on two bearings.
      <br/>
      The gears 19(2) and 36(4) are cantilevered on the right side and the sun gear S2 is cantilevered on the left side of the shaft (S2 shaft).
      <br/>
      An extension of the one input shaft (S2 shaft) acts as the bearing mount for the other input shaft (C shaft).
      <br/>
      This eliminates the need for a bearing mount attached to the housing, which would require additional axial space and cause an assembly problem.
      <br/>
      The 38a accessory drive gear is coupled to the input shaft to rotate at engine speed.
      <br/>
      It is in mesh with the 38i idler gear, which drives the PTOin shaft and which also is in mesh with the 29p pump gear (not shown on the Layout but indicated on FIG. 1H).
      <br/>
      The PTOin shaft drives a gear 33 located at the rear of the transmission assembly where it is in mesh with the PTO output gear 30 which in turn is connected to the PTOout shaft.
      <br/>
      Note, this arrangement makes it possible to bring the engine speed physically around the range transmission back to the center location of the assembly at the rear of the transmission in line with a PTO clutch and gear reduction (not shown).

      In this design it is possible to arrange the gear system such that one single clutch per shaft is used for the two reverse clutches and one forward clutch.
      <br/>
      Also the optional hydrostatic units are moved towards the output side of the transmission.
      <br/>
      This design requires the Power Take Off to be located at the bottom of the transmission system, therefore, a geartrain from the input shaft to the bottom is required, which fits in perfectly with the arrangement of gears for the input transmission.

      The S1 shaft is connected to the sungear of the planetary system and the R shaft is connected to the ring gear of the planetary system.

      The transmission is further comprised of a Front Drive Shaft on which the Front Wheel drive Clutch, the Park Brake and the idler cluster gear 28-38 is mounted.

      The Front Wheel drive Clutch selectively connects the front wheels to the output shaft, the Park Brake selectively stops the output shaft from rotation and the idler cluster gear connects the input shaft to the PTO shaft through gears 32I to 43F to 38 to 28 to 51.

      From the above description associated with FIGS. 5 and 11, it is apparent that several ideas are unique, including but not limited to the following:
      <br/>
      1.
      <br/>
      The arrangement of clutches, gears and shafts in the input transmission which makes it possible to use identical parts for the forward and reverse clutch assemblies, and also makes it possible to attach the hydrostatic units optionally, without the addition of gears, bearings and other major parts. (FIG. 5)
      <br/>
      2. The arrangement of clutches gears and shafts in the input transmission which make it possible to minimize the axial space required for the input transmission and to provide for a Power Take Off. (FIG. 11)
      <br/>
      3. The mounting of the planetary system, providing flotation of the sun gear S1 and the carrier C in addition to providing stability through the radially fixed sun gear S2 in combination with the semifloating-floating ring gear R, which is supported on one side by the bearing BF.
      <br/>
      4. The mounting of the S2 shaft on two bearings with cantilevered mounting of gears on each side in addition to provide a bearing mount for the C shaft through a cantilevered extension of the S2 shaft.
      <br/>
      5. The arrangement of gears, clutches and shafts in the output transmission providing for a maximum utilization of axial space for essentially a five speed package plus a park brake on two centers.
      <br/>
      6. The arrangement of the pump drive and the PTO which utilizes the necessary idler gear 38i for two purposes: first to bring the pump drive gear 27p far enough out to provide clearance for the pump and second to provide a connection for the PTOin shaft. (Note that the direction of rotation of the PTOout shaft requires the idler gear.)
