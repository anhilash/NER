    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention, generally, relates to a control system for controlling the technique of attaching a stiffener to a flexible substrate.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">With the dramatic increase in the number of circuits on a substrate today, both consumer confidence and maintenance of the competitive advantage in the market place require that the existing standards for electrical performance must be maintained.</p>
    <p num="6">
      A step in this direction has already been taken in the development of the Ball Grid Array for integrated circuit packages, which now is taken to another height by the use of flexible substrates.
      <br/>
      The ball grid array packages permit substantial increases in the number of circuit connections per unit area, but controlling the manufacturing techniques involved have produced problems that are quite real and difficult to solve.
      <br/>
      Expected solutions require increases in cost and results that at best can be inconsistant.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The control of a system of attaching a stiffener material to a flexible substrate having solder balls already attached, without damage to the solder balls, is more of a manufacturing problem than would occur to a casual observer.
      <br/>
      It is so realistic and formable of a problem that special tools and programs must be implemented in the manufacturing process to meet any quality yield objectives.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">It is an object of the present invention to provide a way to control a technique for attaching a stiffener to a flexible substrate without disturbing solder balls on a surface of the substrate.</p>
    <p num="9">Another object of the present invention is to provide a way for controlling the power used during the attaching of a stiffener to a flexible substrate whereby the functioning of predetermined process devices are controlled in a pre-set manner.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Briefly, the control technique of the present invention includes a computer readable medium with four programs.
      <br/>
      A first program for controlling the steps that run a sequence of steps for setting certain devices in a start condition.
      <br/>
      A second program includes instructions for setting a start condition.
      <br/>
      A third program includes instructions for controlling a timer to set time intervals involved in the sequence of steps.
      <br/>
      A fourth program includes instructions for monitoring predetermined processes.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, a brief description of which follows.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">FIG. 1 of the drawings, is a flow chart that illustrates a technique, according to the invention, for control of the power to a machine that operates a sequence of steps to ensure that all electromechanical devices used in the process are in a correct position and/or state prior to allowing an operator to proceed with the manufacturing of parts.</p>
    <p num="14">
      This FIGURE illustrates that each device is commanded to a start/reset condition and is monitored by a feedback device.
      <br/>
      A verify timer is started allowing time for the feedback device to react to the start/reset command.
      <br/>
      If a correct status is not back at the end of the timer period, an error routine is initiated, and a fault status is displayed to the operator.

    <p num="30">Go to FIG. 2 for an illustration of the SHUTTLE ROUTINE.</p>
    <p num="31">
      In FIG. 2 of the drawings, it is illustrated how modular control for a shuttle routine to a stripper plate is achieved in order to transfer flexible substrates from the shuttle to a TBGA punch using the stripper plate.
      <br/>
      The operator starts this procedure by a switch to turn on a hold-down vacuum after the substrate has been set on shuttle location pins.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The hold-down vacuum is verified, the shuttle is sent to the stripper plate transfer location, a stripper plate motor is commanded to a "down" position, the down position is verified and the vacuum is transferred from the shuttle to the stripper plate.
      <br/>
      Once verified, the stripper plate motor is commanded to an "up" position, thereby lifting the aligned substrate from the shuttle to a punch.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The transfer of the flexible substrate from the input shuttle to the punch is critical due to solder balls that are attached to the flexible material of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The motor that drives the punch is coded for a fast transfer with a deceleration profile as a flexible substrate approaches the punch.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      At this point, the flexible substrate transfer is controlled, and damage to any of the solder balls is avoided.
      <br/>
      The software involved for this transfer routine is in the motor controller.
      <br/>
      If a "correct" status is not achieved by the end of the timer period, an "error" routine is initiated, and an error status is displayed to the operator.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The procedure begins from a OPERATOR LOAD STIFFENER step, as follows:</p>
    <p num="36">The Operator (25) loads a stiffener on the Input Shuttle.</p>

      FIGS. 3A and 3B of the drawings illustrates a modular control of a punch device and a press device for transferring a flexible substrate to the punch and for transferring a stiffener to the press.
      <br/>
      When these procedures are verified by a switch feedback, the input shuttles are commanded to "home" (or "reload") positions for the start of a new cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      At this point in the sequence of steps, the punch is commanded to a "down" position, the flexible substrate is cut to size and the press with a stiffener held in position by vacuum is commanded to an "up" location.
      <br/>
      The process timer is started and the pressure is increased to perform the attachment of the stiffener to the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The output shuttle is commanded to a position under the press for the eventual removal of the flexible substrate and stiffener assembly.
      <br/>
      Pressure transducers monitor for even pressure around the substrate and also signal a possible jam condition.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      If no error is detected, the process timer will signals for the punch and press to be retracted, the vacuum is turned off and the substrate/stiffener assembly is set into an output nest for transfer to a part output buffer.

      If an error is detected, the error routine is initiated, and an error is posted to the operator.
