      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an electrophotographic photosensitive member, process cartridge and electrophotographic apparatus which use the same photosensitive member, and process for producing the same photosensitive member, more particularly to the photosensitive member having a photosensitive layer containing a specific compound, process cartridge and electrophotographic apparatus which use the same photosensitive member, and process for producing the same photosensitive member.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Inorganic materials, e.g., selenium, cadmium sulfide and zinc oxide, are known as the photoconductive materials for employing electrophotographic photosensitive members.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, organic materials, e.g., polyvinyl carbazole, phthalocyanine and azo-based pigments, have been widely used because of their advantages of, e.g., high productivity and being less polluting environments, in spite of their inferiority to inorganic materials in, e.g., photoconductive characteristics and durability.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      These electrophotographic photosensitive members are frequently of a function-separated type, which is laminated with the separate charge-generating and charge-transporting layers, in order to simultaneously satisfy the required electric and mechanical properties.
      <br/>
      It is needless to say that an electrophotographic photosensitive member is required to have sufficient sensitivity, electric properties and optical properties for the electrophotographic process to which it is applied.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is required to be sufficiently resistant to various external electric and mechanical forces generated during the various steps, e.g., electrification, exposure, toner development, transferring images to paper and cleaning, which will be applied to the surface of the photosensitive member for repeated use.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Concretely, it is required to be resistant to surface wear and scratching caused by an object coming into contact with the surface, to surface deterioration caused by electrification, e.g., decreased transfer efficiency and slip characteristics, and to electrical deterioration, e.g., decreased sensitivity and potential.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The surface layer for electrophotographic photosensitive members of organic photoconductive materials is generally a thin layer of resin, and its functions are largely determined by properties of the resin.
      <br/>
      Recently, acrylic resin, polycarbonate resin and the like are used as the ones which can satisfy the above requirements to some extent.
      <br/>
      However, none of these resins can simultaneously satisfy all of the above requirements.
      <br/>
      In particular, their insufficient hardness is one of the largest problems to be solved for further improving durability of the photosensitive members.
      <br/>
      The surface layer, even when the above resin is used therefor, will be worn or damaged when used repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Recently, low-molecular-weight compounds, e.g., charge-transporting compounds, are frequently used in large quantities to satisfy the requirements for higher sensitivity.
      <br/>
      However, strength of films of such compounds will be greatly decreased, because of their plasticizing functions, aggravating wear and/or scratching-caused damages of the surface layer when it is repeatedly used.
      <br/>
      Another type of possible problems resulting from use of such compounds is tendency of these compounds to separation while the electrophotographic photosensitive member is stored.
    </p>
    <p num="9">One of the means proposed to solve these problems is use of a settable resin for the charge-transporting layer, as disclosed by, e.g., Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2-127652. Such a resin will greatly improve resistance of the charge-transporting layer to cracking and damages when used repeatedly by promoting hardening and cross-linking of the layer.</p>
    <p num="10">
      It should be noted, however, that a low-molecular-weight compound inherently works as a plasticizer in the binder resin, even when a settable resin is used, and will not drastically improve the above-mentioned problems resulting from separation.
      <br/>
      In a charge-transporting layer composed of an organic charge-transporting material and binder resin, its charge-transporting capacity largely depends on properties of the resin, by which is meant that it is difficult to sufficiently satisfy the requirements of high hardness and electrophotographic characteristics simultaneously, because, for example, a settable resin of sufficiently high hardness tends to decrease the charge-transporting capacity, to possibly increase residual potential when the member is repeatedly used.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 5-216249 and 7-72640 disclose an electrophotographic photosensitive member with a charge-transporting layer containing a monomer with carbon-carbon double bond, where the double bond works as the charge-transporting agent, when excited by heat or light energy.
      <br/>
      However, the charge-transporting agent is merely attached to the main skeleton of the polymer like a pendant, difficult to sufficiently improve mechanical strength because of insufficient removal of the above-mentioned plasticizing function.
      <br/>
      Increasing concentration of the charge-transporting material in an attempt to improve the charge-transporting capacity decreases cross-linking density, leading to insufficient mechanical strength.
      <br/>
      This may also cause adverse effects of necessary additives for polymerization, e.g., initiator, on the electrophotographic characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      As another means to solve the above problems, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 8-248649 discloses an electrophotographic photosensitive member whose charge-transporting layer is composed of a thermoplastic resin with a group having charge-transporting capacity in the main skeleton.
      <br/>
      This charge-transporting layer is more resistant to the separation and mechanically stronger than the conventional, molecule-dispersion type layer.
      <br/>
      However, improvement of strength is limited, when a thermoplastic resin is used, and handling and productivity-related characteristics of the member, including solubility of the resin, are not sufficient.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Therefore, there are demands for the photosensitive members which can simultaneously satisfy the requirements for mechanical strength and charge-transporting capacity to a higher extent.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">It is an object of the present invention to provide an electrophotographic photosensitive member of higher resistance to wear and scratching, and also of higher resistance to the separation by solving the problems involved in the conventional electrophotographic photosensitive member to increase film strength.</p>

      The reactions for forming polymers fall into general categories of chain polymerization and stepwise polymerization, and mode of the polymerization for the present invention belongs to the former category.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the chain polymerizations include polymerization of unsaturated groups, ring-opening polymerization and isomerization polymerization in which the reaction proceeds mainly via an intermediate, e.g., radicals and ions (refer to, e.g., "Chemistry of Basic Synthesis Resins (a new edition)," by Tadahiro Miwa, published by Giho-do Shuppan, p. 24, Jul. 25, 1995 (first edition, 8th impression)).
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The chain-polymerizing functional group is the one capable of proceeding the chain polymerization.
      <br/>
      The functional groups for polymerization of unsaturated groups and ring-opening polymerization are described below.
      <br/>
      They account for most of the chain-polymerizing functional groups and have wide applications.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Polymerization of unsaturated groups is one mode of polymerization in which one or more unsaturated groups, e.g., C.dbd.C, C.dbd.C, C.dbd.O, C.dbd.N and C.tbd.N, mainly C.dbd.C, react each other by radicals or ions.
      <br/>
      These unsaturated polymerizable functional groups include, but not limited to, the following groups:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)

    <p num="28">wherein, R is an alkyl group, e.g., methyl, ethyl or propyl, which may have a substituent; aralkyl group, e.g., benzyl or phenethyl, which may have a substituent; aryl group, e.g., phenyl, naphthyl or anthryl, which may have a substituent; hydrogen atom; or the like.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Ring-opening polymerization is a reaction in which an unstable ring-structure having a strain, e.g., carbon ring, oxo ring and nitrogen-containing hetero ring, is activated and opened by the action of a catalyst, and, at the same time, polymerization reaction is repeated to form a chain-shaped polymer.
      <br/>
      An ion basically works as the active species in most of these reactions.
      <br/>
      The functional groups for ring-opening polymerization include, but not limited to, the following groups:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)

      When the oxidation potential exceeds 1.2 V, it is difficult to inject the charge (hole) from the charge-generating material.

      <br/>
      The problems possibly occurring at an oxidation potential below 0.4 V include decreased electrification capacity, and accelerated deterioration of the compound because it is easily oxidized, which, in turn, may cause the problems, e.g., deteriorated sensitivity, blurred images, and excessive potential changes when the photosensitive member is repeatedly used.
      <br/>
      Oxidation potential can be determined by the following procedure:
    </p>
    <p num="59">Measurement of Oxidation Potential</p>
    <p num="60">Oxidation potential of the hole-transporting compound was determined by an analyzer with a saturated calomel reference electrode and 0.1N (n-Bu)4 N+ ClO4- acetonitrile solution as the electrolytic solution, where the potential applied to the working electrodes of platinum was swept by a potential sweeper, to determine the oxidation potential from the peak in the current-potential curve.</p>
    <p num="61">
      More concretely, the sample was dissolved in the 0.1N (n-Bu)4 N+ ClO4+ acetonitrile solution to have a concentration of approximately 5 to 10 mmol %. A voltage was applied to the sample solution by the working electrodes in a range from 0 to 1.5 V, in which it was increased linearly to establish the current-potential curve.
      <br/>
      The potential which gave the peak current (the first peak, when two or more peaks were observed) was defined as the oxidation potential.

      In the present invention, the hole-transporting compound is included in a three-dimensional, cross-linked structure at two or more cross-linked points via the covalent bonds in the photosensitive layer by polymerizing/cross-linking the hole-transporting compound with at least two chain-polymerizing functional groups in the same molecule.
      <br/>
      It is possible to polymerize/cross-link the hole-transporting compound by itself, or after mixing it with another compound with chain-polymerizing group, its type and quantity being not limited.
      <br/>
      The other compound above with chain-polymerizing group may be a monomer, oligomer or polymer with chain-polymerizing group.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      When the functional group in the hole-transporting compound is the same as, or polymerizable with, that in the other chain-polymerizing compound, they can be bonded to each other via a covalent bond, to form a three-dimensional, cross-linked, copolymerized structure.
      <br/>
      When these functional groups are not polymerizable with each other, the photosensitive layer is composed of a mixture of two or more three-dimensional hardened compounds, or of the three-dimensional, hardened compound as the major ingredient which contains the other chain-polymerizing compound monomer or hardened compound thereof.
      <br/>
      In such a case, it is possible to form an inter penetrating network (IPN) by carefully controlling its compounding ratio and film-making process.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      The photosensitive layer may be made of a monomer, oligomer or polymer which has no group chain-polymerizable with the hole-transporting compound, or of a monomer, oligomer or polymer which has a polymerizable group other than chain-polymerizable one.
      <br/>
      It is also possible, depending on situations, for the photosensitive layer to contain a hole-transporting compound which is not chemically included into the three-dimensional, cross-linked structure, i.e., a compound having no chain-polymerizing functional group.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it may be incorporated with other types of additives, e.g., lubricant of finely powdered resin containing fluorine.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The photosensitive member of the present invention has a photosensitive layer comprising a charge-generating layer containing a charge-generating compound and charge-transporting layer containing a charge-transporting compound, formed one on another on a support in this or reversed order.
      <br/>
      The photosensitive layer may be of a single layer with a charge-generating and charge-transporting compound dispersed therein.
      <br/>
      In the former laminated type photosensitive layer, two or more charge-transporting layers may be used.
      <br/>
      In the latter, single-layer photosensitive layer, the layer containing a charge-generating and charge-transporting compound may be further laminated with a charge-transporting layer or protective layer.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Any configuration can be used, so long as the hole-transporting compound with chain-polymerizing groups and/or that compound after being polymerized/cross-linked are included in the photosensitive layer.
      <br/>
      However, the function-separated type photosensitive member configuration, with a charge-generating and charge-transporting layer laminated in this order on a support, is preferable viewed from characteristics of the member, in particular electric characteristics (e.g., residual potential) and durability.
      <br/>
      One of the advantages brought by the present invention is durability of the surface layer improved without sacrificing charge-transporting capacity.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      Any material may be used for the support for the electrophotographic photosensitive member of the present invention, so long as it is electroconductive.
      <br/>
      It may be of a metal, e.g., aluminum, copper, chromium, nickel, zinc or stainless steel, or an alloy, formed into a drum or sheet.
      <br/>
      It may be also of a plastic film laminated with metallic foil (e.g., aluminum or copper foil) or deposited with aluminum, indium oxide, tin oxide or the like, or metallic film, plastic film or paper provided with an electroconductive layer formed by spreading an electroconductive material by itself or combined with a binder resin.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      The present invention may have a subbing layer with barrier and adhesion functions between the support and photosensitive layer.
      <br/>
      The subbing layer is provided for, e.g., improvement of the photosensitive layer in adhesion or paintability, protection of the support, coating defects in the support, improvement in characteristics of injecting charge from the support, or protection of the photosensitive layer from electrical breakdown.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The materials suitable for the subbing layer include polyvinyl alcohol, poly-N-vinyl imidazole, polyethylene oxide, ethyl cellulose, ethylene-acrylate copolymer, casein, polyamide, N-methoxy-methylated 6-nylon, copolymerized nylon, glue, and gelatin.
      <br/>
      For forming the subbing layer, a suitable material dissolved in an adequate solvent is spread over the support and dried.
      <br/>
      Its thickness is preferably 0.1 to 2  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="90">The laminated type photosensitive layer has a charge-generating and charge-transporting layer.</p>
    <p num="91">
      The materials suitable for the charge-generating layer include dyes based on selenium-tellurium, pyrilium and thiapyrilium, and a variety of central metals and crystalline systems.
      <br/>
      More concretely, they include crystalline phthalocyanine compounds of  ALPHA ,  BETA ,  GAMMA ,  EPSILON , or X type; pigments of anthoanthorone, dibenzpyrenequinone, pyranthrone, trisazo, dis-azo, monoazo, indigo, quinacridon, asymmetric quinocyanine; quinocyanine; and amorphous silicon (disclosed by Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 54-143645).
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      The charge-generating layer is formed by the following procedure: a mixture of the charge-generating material and a 0.3 to 4 times larger quantity of a binder resin is dispersed in a solvent thoroughly by a homogenizer, supersonic disperser, ball mill, vibration ball mill, sand mill, attriter, roll mill or the like, and spread and dried.
      <br/>
      It is a film of single composition of the charge-generating material, deposited by, e.g., evaporation.
      <br/>
      Its thickness is preferably 5  MU m or less, more preferably 0.1 to 2  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="93">The binder resins useful for the present invention include polymers/copolymers of vinyl compounds, e.g., styrene, vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, acrylate ester, methacrylate ester, vinylidene fluoride, trifluoroethylene; and polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetal, polycarbonate, polyester, polysulfone, polyphenylene oxide, polyurethane, cellulosic resin, phenolic resin, melamine resin, silicon-containing resin and epoxy resin.</p>
    <p num="94">
      The hole-transporting compound with chain-polymerizing functional groups, useful for the present invention, can be used for forming the charge-transporting layer on the charge-generating layer, or the surface protective layer having hole-transporting capacity on the charge-transporting layer of the charge-transporting material and binder resin on the charge-generating layer.
      <br/>
      The protective layer, having hole-transporting capacity, is within the definition of photosensitive layer.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      In each case, it is preferable that a solution containing the hole-transporting compound is spread and then polymerized/cross-linked.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to form the protective layer using a solution containing the hole-transporting compound, reaction-hardened and then dispersed or dissolved again in a solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      The hole-transporting compound with chain-polymerizing groups for the charge-transporting layer is used at 20 wt. % or more as the hydride adduct of the hole-transporting group (e.g., A in the general formula (1)) based on the whole charge-transporting layer after it is hardened, preferably 40 wt. % or more.
      <br/>
      At below 20 wt. %, its charge-transporting capacity tends to decrease, possibly causing problems, e.g., decreased sensitivity and increased residual potential.
      <br/>
      Thickness of the charge-transporting layer is preferably 1 to 50  MU m, more preferably 3 to 30  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      When the hole-transporting compound with chain-polymerizing groups is used for forming the surface protective layer on the charge-generating/charge-transporting layers, the charge-transporting layer below the protective layer can be formed by coating and drying a solution of an adequate charge-transporting compound and binder resin (which can be selected from the above resins for the charge-generating layer) dispersed/dissolved in a solvent.
      <br/>
      The adequate charge-transporting compounds include polymers having heterocyclic or condensed polycyclic aromatic compounds, e.g., poly-N-vinylcarbazole and polystyryl anthracene; heterocyclic compounds, e.g., pyrazoline, imidazole, oxazole, triazole and carbazole; triaryl alkane derivatives, e.g., triphenylmethane; triarylamine derivatives, e.g., triphenylamine; and low-molecular-weight compounds, e.g., phenylenediamine derivatives, N-phenylcarbazole derivatives, stilbene derivatives and hydrazine derivatives.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      For the ratio of the charge-transporting compound to binder resin, in the case when all weight of both the charge-transporting compound and the binder resin is made 100% by weight, the charge-transporting compound accounts for preferably 30 to 100% by weight based on 100% of the total composition of the charge-transporting compound and binder resin, more preferably 50 to 100% by weight at below 30% by weight of the charge-transporting compound, charge-transporting capacity may decrease, possibly causing problems such as decreased sensitivity and increased residual potential.
      <br/>
      Thickness of the charge-transporting layer is preferably 1 to 50  MU m as total thickness of the upper surface-protective layer and charge-transporting layer, more preferably 5 to 30  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="99">In any case of the present invention, the photosensitive layer containing the hardened hole-transporting compound with chain-polymerizing groups may be incorporated with the charge-transporting compound.</p>
    <p num="100">When the single-layered photosensitive layer is used for the present invention, the photosensitive layer may be formed by polymerizing/cross-linking a solution containing both hole-transporting and charge-generating compounds, or the single-layered photosensitive layer containing both hole-transporting and charge-generating compounds may be coated with a solution containing the hole-transporting compound to be polymerized/cross-linked thereon.</p>
    <p num="101">The photosensitive layer for the present invention may be incorporated with various additives, including an inhibitor (e.g., antioxidant agent or ultraviolet ray absorber), or a lubricant (e.g., finely powdered resin containing fluorine).</p>
    <p num="102">
      The methods for spreading a solution to form each layer include dip coating, spray coating, curtain coating and spin coating.
      <br/>
      Of these, dip coating is more preferable than the others, because of its high efficiency/productivity.
      <br/>
      The known film-making processes, e.g., evaporation and plasma-aided one, may be adequately selected for the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="103">The hole-transporting compound with chain-polymerizing groups, useful for the present invention, may be polymerized/cross-linked by the aid of radioactive ray, heat or light.</p>
    <p num="104">
      The one aided by radioactive ray is more preferable, because it can dispense with a polymerization initiator, which is one of the most notable advantages of this process.
      <br/>
      This will make it possible to form a three-dimensional photosensitive matrix of very high purity, and secure good electrophotographic characteristics.
      <br/>
      Its productivity is also high, because polymerization is effected more efficiently in a shorter time.
      <br/>
      Another advantage comes from high permeability of radioactive ray, which hardens the layer while being much less affected by a shielding material, e.g., an additive or the like, present in the layer or forming a thick layer.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      It should be noted, however, that the polymerization may be retarded, depending on type of the chain-polymerizing group used or type of its central skeleton.
      <br/>
      In such a case, a polymerization initiator may be used in an acceptable range.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      The radioactive rays useful for the present invention include electron ray and gamma ray, the former being more preferable for its capacity to enhance polymerization efficiency.
      <br/>
      Suitable accelerators for electron ray, when it is used, include scanning, electrocurtain, broad beam, pulse and laminar types.
      <br/>
      It is very important to set adequate irradiation conditions, when electron ray is used, for the photosensitive layer to manifest the electrical characteristics and durability.
      <br/>
      The hole-transporting compound is irradiated with electron ray, accelerated preferably at 300 KV or less, more preferably 150 KV or less, at an irradiation dose preferably in a range from 1 to 100 Mrad, more preferably from 3 to 50 Mrad.
      <br/>
      Deterioration of the photosensitive characteristics increases as acceleration voltage of the electron ray increases beyond 300 KV.
      <br/>
      For irradiation dose, cross-linking will be insufficient at below 1 Mrad, and the photosensitive characteristics tend to be deteriorated at above 100 Mrad.
    </p>
    <p num="107">When heat-aided polymerization is adopted, it may be effected in the presence or absence of a polymerization initiator, the former being more preferable for efficient polymerization process at a lower temperature.</p>
    <p num="108">
      Any polymerization initiator may be used, so long as it has a half-life at room temperature or above.
      <br/>
      The initiators useful for the present invention include ammonium persulfate; peroxides, e.g., dicumyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, cyclohexane peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide and di-t-butyl peroxide; and azo compounds, e.g., azo-bis-butylonitrile.
      <br/>
      It is dosed at around 0.01 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the compound having chain-polymerizing groups.
      <br/>
      Reaction temperature varies in a range from room temperature to 200 (degree)  C., depending on the initiator used.
    </p>
    <p num="109">When light-aided polymerization is used for the present invention, a photopolymerization initiator is normally needed, because the reaction very rarely proceeds by light energy only.</p>
    <p num="110">
      The photopolymerization initiator initiates the polymerization, after absorbing ultraviolet ray having a wavelength of 400 nm or less to generate the active species, e.g., radicals and ions.
      <br/>
      The initiators useful for the present invention include those generate radicals, e.g., acetophenone-, benzoin-, benzophenone- and thioxanthone-based ones; and those generate ions, e.g., diazonium, sulfonium, iodonium and metal complex compounds.
      <br/>
      More recently, however, new polymerization initiators have been proposed as the ones which generate the above active species by absorbing infrared/visible rays having a wavelength of above 400 nm.
      <br/>
      They can be also used for the present invention.
      <br/>
      The light-aided initiator is dosed at around 0.01 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the compound having chain-polymerizing groups.
      <br/>
      A heat-aided and light-aided initiator can be used simultaneously for the present invention.

      FIGURE illustrates the electrophotographic apparatus equipped with the process cartridge having the electrophotographic photosensitive member of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The drum-shaped electrophotographic photosensitive member 1 of the present invention is driven to rotate around the axis 2 at a given circumferential speed in the arrowed direction.
      <br/>
      The member 1 is uniformly electrified positively or negatively at a given potential by the primary electrifying means 3, while being rotated, and then exposed to light 4 by an exposure means, e.g., slit or laser beam scanning (not shown).
      <br/>
      As a result, electrostatic latent images are formed one by one over the photosensitive member 1.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      The electrostatic latent image formed is then developed with a toner by the developing means 5, and the developed image is transferred one after another by the transferring means 6 to the transfer paper 7, which is supplied synchronously with rotation of the photosensitive member 1 from a paper feeder (not shown) to the space between the photosensitive member 1 and transferring means 6.
      <br/>
      The transfer paper 7, on receiving the developed image, is separated from the photosensitive member 1 and sent to the image fixing means 8, where the image is fixed.
      <br/>
      The fixed image is printed out as a copy by a printer outside of this electrophotographic apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      The surface of the photosensitive member 1 is cleaned by the cleaning means 9 to remove the residual toner, after the image is transferred, and treated by front exposure light 10 emitted from an exposure means (not shown) to remove electricity, for repeated use for forming images.
      <br/>
      When the primary electrifying means 3 is a contact type equipped with an electrifying roll or the like, front exposure light may be dispensed with.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      In the present invention, some of the constitutional members, e.g., the electrophotographic photosensitive member 1, primary electrifying means 3, developing means 5 and cleaning means 9, can be integrated into a process cartridge assembly, which is freely attached to or detached from an electrophotographic apparatus body, e.g., a copier or laser beam printer.
      <br/>
      For example, at least one of the primary electrifying means 3, developing means 5 and cleaning means 9 is supported together with the photosensitive member 1 to form a cartridge assembly, e.g., the process cartridge 11 attachable to or detachable from the apparatus body using a guiding means, e.g., rail 12 in the apparatus body.
    </p>
    <p num="115">The exposure light 4 is the light reflected from or passing through an original image, or the laser beam scanned in accordance with a signal of the original image read by a sensor and signalized, or the light irradiated by driving an LED array or liquid-crystalline shutter array.</p>

      This coating material was spread over the charge-generating layer, and irradiated with electron ray under the conditions of accelerating voltage: 150 KV and irradiation dose: 30 Mrad, and hardened to form a 15  MU m thick charge-transporting layer, completing the electrophotographic photosensitive member.

    <p num="123">
      The electrophotographic photosensitive member thus prepared was assessed for its temporal separation, electrophotographic characteristics and durability.
      <br/>
      The temporal separation was assessed by an acceleration test in which the sample was preserved at 75 (degree)  C. for 14 days with a cleaning blade of urethane rubber for copiers pressed to the sample surface.
      <br/>
      It was then microscopically observed to judge whether there was a separation or not.

      When there was no separation observed, the test was further continued for a total of 30 days.

    <p num="124">

      <br/>
      The durability test in which an original image was copied 10,000 times was conducted, to observe whether there was a defective copy or not visually, wear of the photosensitive member, and the photosensitive member characteristics, and to determine changes in the characteristics,  DELTA Vd,  DELTA Vl (difference between quantity of light necessary to set the initial Vl at -150 V and Vl of the durability-tested sample irradiated with the same quantity of light) and  DELTA Vsl.
