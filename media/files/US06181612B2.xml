      FIG. 12 is a block diagram of a typical conventional SCRAM capable of operating in burst mode.

      Each memory cell MC comprises two access transistors 13 and 14, two driver transistors 15 and 16, and two load resistors 17 and 18.
      <br/>
      The access transistors 13 and 14 and the driver transistors 15 and 16 are an n-channel MOS transistor each.
      <br/>
      The load resistors 17 and 18 are each composed of a resistance element, a p-channel MOS transistor or a thin film transistor.

      The load resistor 17 and the driver transistor 15 are connected in series between a power supply node N1 that receives a supply potential and a grounding node N2 that receives a grounding potential.

      An input pin 100 admits an external address signal EXT.ADD from the outside.

      An input pin 101 gets a read/write control signal /WE furnished externally.

      The slash symbol (/) indicates that the signal having the symbol is an inverted signal.
      <br/>
      This applies throughout the description hereunder.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The burst counter unit 80 includes AND gates 81 and 82, a register 83 and a burst counter 84.
      <br/>
      The AND gate 81 receives the advance signal AD and clock signal CLK, and outputs a signal representing the result of the AND operation on the two signals.
      <br/>
      The AND gate 82 admits the address strobe signal ADS and clock signal CLK, and outputs a signal denoting the result of the AND operation on the two signals.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The register 83 receives both the output signal of the AND gate 82 and the external address signal EXT.ADD. In operation, the register 83 takes the external address signal EXT.ADD into the burst counter unit 80 in response to the output signal from the AND gate 82.
      <br/>
      The n-bit address admitted into the register 83 is separated into a k-bit address and an (n-k)-bit address.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The burst counter 84 is a binary counter that receives the output signals of the AND gates 81 and 82, and the k-bit address following the address separation.
      <br/>
      In operation, the burst counter 84 loads the k-bit address by responding to the output signal of the AND gate 82, and increments the value of the k-bit address in reply to the output signal of the AND gate 81.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The k-bit address representing the result of the counting by the burst counter 84 is then recombined with the separated (n-k)-bit address.
      <br/>
      The result is an n-bit internal address that is fed to the decoder 2.
      <br/>
      Given the n-bit internal address signal INT.ADD, the decoder 2 selects one word line 11.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The register 21 receives the clock signal CLK and the read/write control signal /WE.
      <br/>
      The read/write control signal /WE is admitted into the register 21 responding to a leading edge of the clock signal CLK.
      <br/>
      The read/write control signal /WE indicates a write state when brought Low, and denotes a read state when driven High.
      <br/>
      The read/write control circuit 22 outputs a control signal for controlling the bit line pre charging circuit 3 and the sense amplifier and write driver 4 in reply to the read/write control signal /WE admitted through the register 21.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Given the control signal from the read/write control circuit 22, the bit line precharging circuit 3 precharges a bit line pair 12, 12 to a predetermined high level in preparation for a read operation.
      <br/>
      Upon receipt of the control signal from the read/write control circuit 22, the sense amplifier and write driver 4 operates as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="20">In the write operation, the sense amplifier and write driver 4 transfers to the bit line pair 12, 12 the input data DI admitted into the register 23 from the outside via a data input/output pin 9.</p>
    <p num="21">
      The conventional SRAM of the above constitution typically works as follows: when the advance signal AD is brought High, the address on the burst counter 84 is incremented every time a leading edge of the clock signal CLK is encountered.
      <br/>
      As the internal address signal INT.ADD is incremented in this manner, the decoder 2 selects different word lines 11 successively.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Below is a description of how the SRAM of FIG. 12 works in a read operation.
      <br/>
      FIG. 13 is a timing chart showing typical waveforms of signals used by the SRAM of FIG. 12 in the read operation.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Referring to FIGS. 12 and 13, the read/write control signal /WE is fixed to the high level for the read operation.
      <br/>
      When a leading edge of the clock signal CLK is encountered, the address strobe signal ADS is brought High.
      <br/>
      This allows the external address input signal EXT.ADD to be admitted into the register 83.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Thereafter, every time the clock signal CLK is at a leading edge and the advance signal ADV is High, the address indicated by the internal address signal INT.ADD based on the address An given by the external address signal EXT.ADD is incremented by the burst counter 84.
      <br/>
      The incremented address occurs as An, An+1, An+2, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      This causes a different word line 11 to be selected in each cycle of the clock signal CLK.
      <br/>
      As a result, the output data DO varies in the sequence of Qn, Qn+1, Qn+2, etc.
      <br/>
      This in turn allows data to be output in burst mode from memory cells MC, MC, etc.
      <br/>
      In the memory cell array 1.

      FIG. 14 is a timing chart showing typical waveforms of signals used by the SRAM of FIG. 12 in the write operation.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Referring to FIGS. 12 and 14, the read/write control signal /WE for the write operation is given as a pulse signal as opposed to the high-level signal used in the read operation.
      <br/>
      The input data DI (Dn, Dn+1, Dn+2, etc.) Is admitted in synchronism with the pulse-type read/write control signal /WE.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In the write operation, the internal address INT.ADD based on the address An designated by the external address signal EXT.ADD varies in the same manner as in the read operation.

      This allows the input data DI to be written to memory cells MC, MC, etc.

    <p num="30">
      FIG. 15 is a block diagram of one such conventional SRAM also capable of operating in burst mode.

      In FIG. 15, the common parts that also appear in FIG. 12 are designated by like reference numerals, and their descriptions are omitted hereunder where redundant.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The semiconductor memory of FIG. 15 differs from that of FIG. 12 in the following aspects: the burst counter unit 80 is not provided; an output register 5, a multiplexer 7, a burst counter unit 8 and an internal register 20 are furnished; and the memory cell array 1 is divided into a plurality of memory blocks M0 through M3.</p>

      <br/>
      In this case, the memory cell array 1 is divided into four memory blocks M0 through M3 illustratively of 72 bits each.

    </p>
    <p num="35">
      With the word line 11 selected, the sense amplifier 41 receives the data items read simultaneously from the memory blocks M0 through M3 over the bit lines (see FIG. 12).

      The sense amplifier 41 amplifies each of the data items thus received.

    <p num="36">
      The output register 5 is composed of a plurality of D type flip-flop circuits each retaining the data item amplified by the sense amplifier 41.

      With this output register 5, the D type flip-flop circuits correspond to the memory blocks M0 through M3 in the memory cell array 1, serving as four data retaining blocks 50 through 53 respectively.
      <br/>
      Each of the data retaining blocks 50 through 53 in the output register 5 retains data in reply to a transfer signal TR.

    <p num="37">An input pin 92 receives an external chunk address signal EXT.CHA for selecting one of the data retaining blocks 50 through 53 in the output register 5.</p>

      Below is a more detailed description of how the SRAM of FIG. 15 works in a read operation.
      <br/>
      FIG. 16 is a timing chart showing typical waveforms of signals used by the SRAM of FIG. 15 in the read operation.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 16, the cycles of the clock signal CLK are numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Referring to FIG. 16, the address An designated by the memory address signal MADD is admitted into the internal register 20 in response to the first leading edge in the second cycle of the clock signal CLK.
      <br/>
      With the address An thus admitted, the word line 11 (WL) becomes selectable between the second and the fourth cycle.
      <br/>
      In response to this, data is read from the memory cell array 1 and is amplified by the sense amplifier 41.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In the fourth cycle, the transfer signal TR is brought High for a predetermined period of time.
      <br/>
      In response, the sense amplifier 41 transfers the amplified data to each of the data retaining blocks 50 through 53 in the output register 5 while the fourth cycle is in effect.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In the fifth cycle, the burst counter unit 8 admits an address AC stemming from the external chunk address signal EXT.CHA. The counting by the burst counter unit 8 starts in the fifth cycle.
      <br/>
      Between the fifth and the eighth cycle, the internal chunk address signal INT.CHA varies in the sequence of Ac, Ac+1, Ac+2, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="47">Consequently, the data items held in the data retaining blocks 50 through 53 of the output register 5 are output successively from the multiplexer 7 to the outside via the data input/output pin 9.</p>
    <p num="48">As described, the output data DO is output in burst mode, i.e., in the sequence of D(An), D(An+1), etc., from the fifth through the eighth cycle.</p>
    <p num="49">
      Data is then read from an address Am that is input as the memory address signal MADD following the address An.
      <br/>
      In this case, the data corresponding to the address Am is read in the same manner as the data corresponding to the address An.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      While the data related to the current address An is under way, it is necessary to retain, in the data retaining blocks 50 through 53 of the output register 5, the data associated with the address An.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the transfer signal TR for reading the data corresponding to the next address Am is driven High in the ninth cycle following the completion of the burst output of the data associated with the current address An.
    </p>
    <p num="51">Therefore, the burst output of the output data DO related to the next address Am is carried out one cycle after the end of the burst output concerning the current address An, as shown in the sequence of D(Am), D(Am+1), etc. In this manner, the SRAM of FIG. 15 also allows the data therein to be read out in burst mode.</p>
    <p num="52">The conventional SRAMs outlined above have some disadvantages that will now be described.</p>
    <p num="53">
      With the conventional SRAM of FIG. 12, a word line 11 is selected and the related parts of the memory cell array 1 are activated in each of the cycles of the furnished clock signal CLK.
      <br/>
      It follows that the clock cycle time defining a period in which to repeat data output (called the data transfer called hereunder) is determined by the delay times in operations of the word lines 11, 11, etc., of the bit line pairs 12, 12, etc., and of the memory cell arrays MC, MC, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      This means that, with the SRAM of FIG. 12, attempts to reduce the cycle time of the clock signal CLK for higher operating speeds fail to make the cycle time shorter than the sum of the operative delays resulting from the parts of the memory cell array 1.
      <br/>
      Such delays in the operations of various parts in the memory cell array 1 prevent the SRAM of FIG. 12 from operating more quickly than at present.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      With the SRAM of FIG. 15, the timing for the burst output of data is irrelevant to the operative delays of the various parts in the memory cell array 1.
      <br/>
      Such delays do not hamper efforts to make the memory as a whole operate at higher speeds than before.
      <br/>
      However, as mentioned above, the burst output of the data read from the memory cell array 1 poses a different problem.
    </p>
    <p num="56">That is, a data-free period (an interruption in the flow of data output) is bound to occur between two burst outputs, one relating to the current memory address An, the other associated with the next memory address Am.</p>
    <p num="57">
      Suppose that a data output interruption of one cycle period occurs following each burst output lasting four cycles.
      <br/>
      In that case, if one burst output is taken as a single period, the data transfer period is prolonged by 20 percent.
      <br/>
      In other words, the data transfer rate declines by 20 percent.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Thus although the SRAM of FIG. 15 is exempt from the operative delays in the parts of the memory cell array 1, the memory fails to shorten sufficiently the data transfer period in enhancing its operation speed.
      <br/>
      As a result, the SRAM of FIG. 15 is incapable of operating at a sufficiently high speed.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="123">The preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="124">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="125">
      What follows is a description of the first embodiment comprising two output registers.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an SRAM practiced as the first embodiment of the invention and capable of operating in burst mode.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, the common parts that also appear in FIG. 15 are designated by like reference numerals, and their descriptions are omitted hereunder where redundant.
    </p>
    <p num="126">What makes the first embodiment of FIG. 1 different from the conventional SRAM of FIG. 15 is that the first embodiment includes two output registers 5A and 5B, multiplexers 60 through 63, a control circuit 71 and a decoder 72.</p>
    <p num="127">
      The output registers 5A and 5B are each identical in structure to the output register 5 in FIG. 15. The output register 5A is divided into four data retaining blocks A0 through A3 corresponding respectively to the memory blocks M0 through M3 in the memory cell array 1.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the output register 5B is divided into four data retaining blocks B0 through B3 corresponding respectively to the memory blocks M0 through M3 in the memory cell array 1.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      A 72-bit data item read from the memory block M0 and amplified by the sense amplifier 41 is transferred selectively to the data retaining blocks A0 and B0.
      <br/>
      Another 72-bit data item read from the memory block M1 and amplified by the sense amplifier 41 is transferred selectively to the data retaining blocks A1 and B1.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      A 72-bit data item read from the memory block M2 and amplified by the sense amplifier 41 is transferred selectively to the data retaining blocks A2 and B2.
      <br/>
      Another 72-bit data item read from the memory block M3 and amplified by the sense amplifier 41 is transferred selectively to the data retaining blocks A3 and B3.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      Each of the data retaining blocks in the output register 5A receives a transfer signal TRA, to be described later.
      <br/>
      When the transfer signal TRA is activated, the signal causes the corresponding data retaining block to retain the data fed from the sense amplifier 41.
      <br/>
      That is, activating the transfer signal TRA carries out data transfer to the output register 5A.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      Each of the data retaining blocks in the output register 5B receives a transfer signal TRB, to be discussed later.
      <br/>
      When the transfer signal TRB is activated, the signal causes the corresponding data retaining block to retain the data sent from the sense amplifier 41.
      <br/>
      That is, activating the transfer signal TRB executes data transfer to the output register 5B.
    </p>
    <p num="132">The multiplexers 60 through 63 are furnished to correspond respectively with the data retaining blocks A0 through A3 in the output register 5A as well as with the data retaining blocks B0 through B3 in the output register 5B.</p>
    <p num="133">
      The multiplexers 60 through 63 each receive the retained data from the corresponding data retaining blocks in the output register 5A and 5B.
      <br/>
      When responding to selection signals SELA and SELB, to be described later, each of the multiplexers 60 through 63 forwards the corresponding data selectively to the multiplexer 7.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      The control circuit 71 is a sequence circuit capable of distinguishing the output register 5A from the output register 5B for alternate selection thereof.
      <br/>
      The control circuit 71 receives a clock signal CLK.
      <br/>
      In response to the clock signal CLK, the control circuit 71 supplies the decoder 72 with a control signal that controls the decoder.
      <br/>
      The control circuit 71 also controls each of the multiplexers 60 through 63 by feeding the selection signals SELA and SELB thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="135">The selection signal SELA is a signal that causes each of the multiplexers 60 through 63 selectively to output data from the corresponding data retaining block of the output register 5A.</p>
    <p num="136">The selection signal SELB causes each of the multiplexers 60 through 63 selectively to output data from the corresponding data retaining block of the output register 5B.</p>
    <p num="137">
      The decoder 72 receives its control signal from the control circuit 71.
      <br/>
      In response to the control signal, the decoder 72 supplies the output register 5A with the transfer signal TRA ordering the transfer of data from the sense amplifier 41 to the output register 5A; the decoder 72 also supplies the output register 5B with the transfer signal TRB ordering the transfer of data from the sense amplifier 41 to the output register 5B.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      In the SRAM of the above constitution, data is transferred alternately to the output registers 5A and 5B.
      <br/>
      This means that while data is being output to the outside from one output register, data may be transferred from memory cells to the other output register.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      How the first embodiment (i.e., SRAM) of FIG. 1 works in a read operation will now be described.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a timing chart showing typical waveforms of signals used by the first embodiment in the data read operation.

      Referring to FIG. 2, what takes place in the first through the third cycle is the same as that which occurs in the first through the third cycle in FIG. 16. In the fourth cycle, the transfer signal TRA is brought High.
      <br/>
      In response, data is transferred to and retained in the data retaining blocks A0 through A3 of the output register 5A.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      In the fifth through the eighth cycle, the selection signal SELA is driven High.
      <br/>
      In response, the retained data in the data retaining blocks A0 through A3 of the output register 5A is selected respectively by the multiplexers 60 through 63 and sent to the multiplexer 7.

      The multiplexer 7 receives the data from each of the multiplexers 60 through 63.
      <br/>
      Given an internal chunk address signal INT.CHA based on the address Ac of the external chunk address signal EXT.CHA, the multiplexer 7 outputs the received data in burst mode in the fifth through the eighth cycle.

    <p num="143">
      Concurrently with the burst output, the transfer signal TRB is driven High in the eighth cycle.
      <br/>
      In response, the data to be output next in burst mode is transferred from the memory cell array 1 to the data retaining blocks B0 through B3 of the output register 5B.

      In the ninth through the 12th cycle, the selection signal SELB is brought High.

    </p>
    <p num="147">
      Thereafter, the read data is transferred alternately to the output registers 5A and 5B.
      <br/>
      This scheme allows one output register to output the retained data in burst mode while the other output register receives data transferred thereto.
      <br/>
      The burst output and the data transfer are repeated alternately.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      As described, the SRAM practiced as the first embodiment of the invention comprises two output registers.
      <br/>
      The two output registers are utilized alternately for burst output therefrom and for data transfer thereto from the memory cell array 1.
      <br/>
      The circuit workings permit uninterrupted burst output of data.
      <br/>
      With the first embodiment, this benefit is supplemented by another advantageous effect.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      That is, two conventionally related time periods are made independent of each other by the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      One of the two time periods is the cycle time of the clock signal CLK.
      <br/>
      The other is the period from the time the address of the memory address signal MADD is input until the data read from the memory cell array 1 is sufficiently amplified by the sense amplifier 41.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      With the above two time periods dissociated from each other, the shortest possible data transfer period is allowed to be adopted.
      <br/>
      This in turn helps boost the speed of the read operation.
      <br/>
      Even though the operation speed of the memory cell array 1 is low, a high-speed read operation may be realized.
      <br/>
      This eliminates the need for the memory to use illustratively the so-called bipolar CMOS LSI technology, an expensive process technique for enhancing the operation speed of the memory cell array 1.
      <br/>
      As a result, the invention allows semiconductor memories adopting low-cost process techniques to perform high-speed read operations.

    </p>
    <p num="160">
      Referring to FIG. 4, the address An designated by the memory address signal MADD is admitted into the internal register 20 at a first leading edge of the clock signal CLK in the second cycle.

      <br/>
      In response, one of the output registers 5A through 5K receives the amplified data transferred thereto.

      The transferred data is retained in that output register.

      The read register address signal RRA is then input to the decoder 74 for selecting the output register from which to transfer data to the data input/output pin 9.
      <br/>
      Given the read register address signal RRA, the decoder 74 supplies the multiplexers 60a through 63a with a selection signal SEL(x) for selecting the output register corresponding to the address Ax designated by the signal RRA.

      The SRAM practiced as the second embodiment includes three or more output registers.

    <p num="168">
      The second embodiment provides another advantage when equipped illustratively with three output registers in a specific control setup.
      <br/>
      How this setup with its three output registers works will now be described in detail.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      Of the three output registers, the first register is used to retain fixedly the data read from a specific row of memory cells frequently accessed.

    <p num="170">
      Where the address representing the data held in the first output register is to be accessed, the corresponding row of memory cells in the memory cell array 1 is not accessed.

      Instead, the retained data in the first output register is output therefrom.
    </p>
    <p num="171">
      In this control setup, the memory cell array 1 is not used while data is being read from the first output register.
      <br/>
      This means that, concurrently with the data read operation from the first output register during this period, data may be written to memory cells in the memory cell array 1 or transferred from memory cells in the memory cell array 1 to another output register.
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      Where three or more output registers are provided as described, one of them is used to output frequently used data without gaining access to memory cells in the memory cell array 1.
      <br/>
      This setup further helps increase the speed of the data read operation.
      <br/>
      As a result, the overall performance of the semiconductor memory is enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="173">
      The operation above is accomplished by use of a complex control scheme implemented as desired from the outside.

      Such control is made possible by externally supplying the memory with the write register address signal WRA and the read register address signal RRA.
      <br/>
      In a typical computer system, these signals WRA and RRA may be supplied from an external unit such as the host MPU.

      FIG. 5 is a block diagram of an SRAM practiced as the third embodiment and capable of operating in burst mode.

      <br/>
      FIG. 5 omits the data read circuit portion included in FIG. 1 and illustrates instead a data write circuit portion.
    </p>
    <p num="177">
      Referring to FIG. 5, the third embodiment (i.e., SRAM) of FIG. 5 differs from the first embodiment of FIG. 1 in the following points: the data read circuit components such as the output registers 5A and 5B, multiplexers 60 through 63, control circuit 71 and decoder 72 shown in FIG. 1 are all omitted.
      <br/>
      The data write circuit components including an input register 5L, a write driver 42 and a control circuit 75 are depicted instead.

      The input register 5L is identical in structure to the output register 5A or 5B in FIG. 1.

    </p>
    <p num="179">
      The input register 5L receives input data DI being entered over a plurality of cycles via the data input/output pin 9.
      <br/>
      The input register 5L also receives as its control signals the internal chunk address signal INT.CHA from the burst counter unit 8 and a register read/write control signal R/WRC input via an input pin 97.
    </p>
    <p num="180">
      The register read/write control signal R/WRC is a control signal that designates whether or not to write the input data DI to the input register 5L.
      <br/>
      Given the signal R/WRC, the input register 5L is made to accept or reject the input data DI destined thereto.
      <br/>
      If the register read/write control signal R/WRC specifies that the input data DI be written to the input register 5L, the input data DI is written successively to the data retaining blocks L0 through L3 over a plurality of operation cycles in response to the internal chunk address signal INT.CHA.
    </p>
    <p num="181">
      The input register 5L has the written data retained in its data retaining blocks.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows an example in which each of the data retaining blocks in the input register 5L retains a 72-bit data item.
    </p>
    <p num="182">
      The data retained in the data retaining blocks L0 through L3 of the input register 5L is transferred to the respective memory blocks M0 through M3 via the write driver 42 using an appropriate timing.

      The transferred data is written to memory cells in the memory blocks M0 through Me.
    </p>
    <p num="183">
      The data transfer operation in the case above is controlled by the control circuit 75.
      <br/>
      The control circuit 75 receives an array read/write control signal R/WAC from the outside via an input pin 98.
      <br/>
      In responding to the control signal R/WAC thus received, the control circuit 75 supplies a write driver control signal WD to the write driver 42.
    </p>
    <p num="184">
      Given the write driver control signal WD, the write driver 42 transfers in a simultaneous and collective manner the retained data from the data retaining blocks L0 through L3 of the input register 5L to the memory blocks M0 through M3 of the memory cell array 1.
      <br/>
      The data thus transferred to the memory blocks M0 through M3 is written to the single row of memory cells connected to the word line 11 selected by the decoder 2.

      How the third embodiment (i.e., SRAM) of FIG. 5 works will now be described.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 is a timing chart showing typical waveforms of signals used by the third embodiment in a data write operation.
    </p>
    <p num="186">
      Referring to FIG. 6, data is written to the input register 5L in the second through the fifth cycle.
      <br/>
      Initially, the address An designated by the external chunk address signal EXT.CHA is admitted into the burst counter unit 8 at a first leading edge of the clock signal CLK in the second cycle.
      <br/>
      In the notation of the address An, reference character n represents the numeral part of the reference characters L0 through L3 indicating the data retaining blocks of the input register 5L.
    </p>
    <p num="187">That is, addresses An, An+1, An+2 and An+3 designated by the internal chunk address signal INT.CHA output by the burst counter part 8 based on the external chunk address signal EXT.CHA constitute information designating the data retaining blocks L0, L1, L2 and L3, respectively, in the input register 5L.</p>
    <p num="188">
      After the address An is input, the register read/write control signal R/WRC is brought Low to become an active pulse signal.
      <br/>
      This pulse signal is brought Low every time the internal chunk address signal INT.CHA is changed in status.
    </p>
    <p num="189">In the input register 5L, every time the register read/write control signal R/WRC is brought Low, the input data DI is written successively to each of the data retaining blocks corresponding to the addresses designated by the internal chunk address signal INT.CHA.</p>
    <p num="190">
      In the sixth cycle, the array read/write control signal R/WAC is driven Low for a predetermined period of time.
      <br/>
      The write driver control signal WD is brought High in the sixth through the eighth cycle.
      <br/>
      Bringing the write driver control signal WD High causes the write driver 42 to send the retained data from the input register 5L to the memory blocks M0 through M3 in a simultaneous and collective manner.
    </p>
    <p num="191">The moment the array read/write control signal R/WAC is driven Low in the sixth cycle, the address An designated by the memory address signal MADD is admitted into the internal register 20 simultaneously.</p>
    <p num="192">
      With the address An thus supplied, the address An designated by the internal address signal INT.ADD is fed to the decoder 2.
      <br/>
      In response, the word line 11 (WL) is brought High in the sixth through the eighth cycle.
      <br/>
      During these cycles, the data transferred to the memory cell array 1 is written to memory cells of the respective memory cell blocks.
    </p>
    <p num="193">FIG. 6 illustrates a control scheme whereby data transfer to the memory cell array 1 is started in the sixth cycle immediately after the writing of data to the input register 5L.</p>
    <p num="194">
      However, this scheme is only an example and is not limitative of the invention.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the transfer of data to the memory cell array 1 may be started later than the sixth cycle.
      <br/>
      This is because the input register 5L continuously retains its data from the sixth cycle onward and is thus ready for such data transfer from that point on.
    </p>
    <p num="195">
      Furthermore, suppose that it is necessary, by the beginning of the eighth cycle at the latest, to prepare the data to be written to memory cells in the memory cell array 1.
      <br/>
      In that case, it is possible to start the writing of data to the memory cell array 1 two cycles earlier than in the setup of FIG. 6.
    </p>
    <p num="196">
      The SRAM practiced as the third embodiment includes the input register 5L which allows data to be written in burst mode.

      If an SRAM permitting burst output in a data read operation includes an input register such as the register 5L of the third embodiment, the data write operation may be carried out as rapidly as the data read operation.

      The read circuit is a circuit that carries out the reading of data from the memory cell array 1 in an SRAM similar to that of FIG. 3 wherein the output registers 5A through 5K are replaced by two output registers 5A and 5B.

      The write circuit is one which executes the writing of data to the memory cell array 1 in an SRAM similar to that of FIG. 7.

      FIG. 10 is a timing chart showing typical waveforms of signals used by the fifth embodiment in data write and read operations.
      <br/>
      In the description that follows, the signal-related workings that were already discussed in conjunction with the previously described embodiments are omitted hereunder where redundant.
    </p>
    <p num="216">The timing chart of FIG. 10 shows three different kinds of operation: writing of data to an address Az in the memory cell array 1; reading of data from the address An in the memory cell array 1; and reading of data from the address Am in the memory cell array 1.</p>
    <p num="217">
      The three kinds of operation are each divided into the steps detailed below.
      <br/>
      The operation of writing data to the address Az is divided into two steps, a1 and a2.
      <br/>
      Step al involves writing data to the input register 5L in the second through the fifth cycle.
      <br/>
      Step a2 involves transferring the data from the input register 5L to the memory cell array 1 in the 11th through the 13th cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="218">
      The operation of reading data from the address An is also divided into two steps, b1 and b2.
      <br/>
      Step b1 involves transferring data from the memory cell array 1 to the output register 5A or 5B in the third through the fifth cycle.
      <br/>
      Step b2 involves transferring the data from the output register 5A or 5B to the data input/output pin 9 in the sixth through the ninth cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="219">
      The operation of reading data from the address Am is also divided into two steps, c1 and c2.
      <br/>
      Step c1 involves transferring data from the memory cell array 1 to the output register 5A or 5B in the seventh through the ninth cycle.
      <br/>
      Step c2 involves transferring the data from the output register 5A or 5B to the data input/output pin 9 in the 10th through the 13th cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="220">Of the kinds of operations shown in FIG. 10, the data write and read operations are the same as those discussed in connection with the previously described embodiments and will not be discussed further, except for the following details:</p>
    <p num="221">
      The fifth embodiment (i.e., SRAM) of FIG. 9 requires that the sense amplifier 41 and the write driver 42 be operated alternately in writing and reading data to and from the memory cell array 1.
      <br/>
      When the array read/write control signal R/WAC is driven High, the sense amplifier 41 is activated selectively; when the array read/write control signal R/WAC is brought Low, the write driver 42 is operated selectively.
      <br/>
      The SRAM of FIG. 9 thus constituted permits writing and reading of data both in burst mode.
    </p>
    <p num="222">
      Furthermore, the fifth embodiment of FIG. 9 is characterized by another feature.
      <br/>
      This is the ability to carry out in an overlapping manner two kinds of data transfer: the transfer of data from the memory cell array 1 to the output register 5A or 5B (b1, c1), or the transfer of data from the input register 5L to the memory cell array 1 (a2) on the one hand; and the transfer of data from the output register 5A or 5B to the data input/output pin 9 (b2, c2), or the transfer of data from the data input/output pin 9 to the input register 5L (a1) on the other hand.
    </p>
    <p num="223">
      The overlapping actions implemented by the fifth embodiment of FIG. 9 boost the availability of the memory cell array 1.
      <br/>
      This in turn enhances the overall performance of the SRAM-based system.
    </p>
    <p num="224">Sixth Embodiment</p>
    <p num="225">
      The sixth embodiment of the invention will now be described.
      <br/>
      This embodiment involves rapidly reading out data which is held in the input register and not to be written to the memory cell array yet.
    </p>
    <p num="226">
      FIG. 11 is a block diagram of an SRAM practiced as the sixth embodiment of the invention and capable of operating in burst mode.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 11, the common parts that also appear in FIG. 9 are designated by like reference numerals, and their descriptions are omitted hereunder where redundant.
    </p>
    <p num="227">
      The sixth embodiment (i.e., SRAM) of FIG. 11 differs from the fifth embodiment of FIG. 9 mainly in the following points: the decoder 73 is replaced by a decoder 77, the multiplexers 60 through 63 are replaced by multiplexers 64 through 67, and the decoder 74 is replaced by a decoder 78.
      <br/>
      In addition, the data retained in the input register 5L is destined to the write driver 42 and to the multiplexers 64 through 67.
    </p>
    <p num="228">
      In response to the read register address signal RRA, the decoder 78 outputs a selection signal that causes each of the multiplexers 64 through 67 to select one of the three input data items.
      <br/>
      The multiplexers 64 through 67 correspond respectively to the multiplexers 60 through 63 in FIG. 9.
    </p>
    <p num="229">
      The data held in the data retaining blocks L0 through L3 of the input register 5L is supplied to the write driver 42.
      <br/>
      The retained data is also fed from the input register 5L to the multiplexers 64 through 67.
    </p>
    <p num="230">
      The multiplexer 64 receives the retained data from the data retaining blocks A0, B0 and L0.
      <br/>
      The multiplexer 65 receives the retained data from the data retaining blocks A1, B1 and L1.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the multiplexer 66 receives the retained data from the data retaining blocks A2, B2 and L2.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the multiplexer 67 receives the retained data from the data retaining blocks A3, B3 and L3.
    </p>
    <p num="231">
      Given the selection signal from the decoder 78, each of the multiplexers 64 through 67 selects the appropriate data from one of the output registers 5A, 5B and the input register 5L.
      <br/>
      The appropriate data thus chosen is supplied selectively to the multiplexer 7.
    </p>
    <p num="232">
      As described, the sixth embodiment (SRAM) in FIG. 11 of the above constitution allows data which is held in the input register and not yet to be written to memory cells in the memory cell array 1 to be output to the outside via the data input/output pin 9.
      <br/>
      This feature helps output the entered data rapidly to the outside.
    </p>
    <p num="233">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.</p>
