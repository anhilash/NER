      <br/>
      A method and system for calculating the range between a source which emits electromagnetic energy having an unknown frequency and a first receiver of electromagnetic energy at at least three points along a portion of a source trajectory.
      <br/>
      The source trajectory portion is a substantially straight line which has two end points.
      <br/>
      The first receiver moves along a first, substantially straight-line receiver trajectory so that the frequency of the electromagnetic energy is Doppler-shifted.
      <br/>
      The first receiver measures the Doppler-shifted frequency at at least three predetermined times.
      <br/>
      Next, at least two ratios of frequencies are calculated, the ratios being functions of the Doppler-shifted frequencies and bearing angles.
      <br/>
      Finally, the range between the first receiver and the source is calculated from the frequency ratios at the at-least-three points.
      <br/>
      In a first preferred embodiment the source is stationary.

      The invention relates to a method and a system for determining the location and velocity of a source of electromagnetic signals by a receiver of those electromagnetic signals.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention relates to a method and a system for determining the location and velocity of a source of electromagnetic signals by a receiver of those electromagnetic signals, based on measurements of Doppler-shifted frequencies.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Combat aircraft are provided with means for detecting and locating noncooperative electromagnetic emitters, e.g., radars and communication transmitters, such means being known as "threat warning and location systems." Presently existing threat warning and location systems utilize directive receiving antennas to provide for determining the approximate location of such emitters.
      <br/>
      In order to provide the required directivity over a wide band of frequencies, multiple antennas, each of five to ten wavelengths in dimension, are required.
      <br/>
      The installation of such sets of antennas to provide appropriate viewing angles and to satisfy other requirements on combat aircraft of advanced design creates substantial problems for aircraft designers.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention is directed toward determining emitter threat location and velocity through use of signal processing rather than antenna directivity.
      <br/>
      Depending on the desired sector coverage, no more than four small-aperture antennas are required for emitter detection and location system operation.
      <br/>
      The required aperture of each of such antennas would be no more than a few inches.
      <br/>
      Such small-aperture antennas pose minimal problems in installation and can readily be made consistent with other requirements on combat aircraft of advanced design.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      It has been shown that a series of measurements of the Doppler-shifted frequency of the signals from any emitter, including noncooperative emitters, when made from a moving receiver such as one installed on an aircraft, can provide a basis for calculating location and velocity of the emitter.
      <br/>
      In order to make the necessary frequency measurements with sufficient accuracy, the emitter should produce coherent signals.
      <br/>
      In particular, signals which are not continuous (e.g., pulsed radar) should be coherent on a pulse-to-pulse basis.
      <br/>
      Other methods, such as estimation of unshifted frequency, measurement of time-difference-of-arrival, or part-time use of directive antennas, must be used when the signals are not coherent.
    </p>
    <p num="5">The familiar equation for Doppler shift is:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="6">where</p>
    <p num="7">
      fDi  is the value of the ith measurement of the Doppler-shifted frequency, fD
      <br/>
      fo is the unshifted frequency of the emitter
      <br/>
      V is the speed of the moving receiver
      <br/>
      c is the velocity of light
      <br/>
      THETA i is the angle between the velocity vector of the moving receiver and the direction of arrival of the signal from the source for ith measurement
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      It might at first seem that a series of measurements of fD (expressed as fDi ) coupled with velocity and position data would allow for solution of this equation in terms of  THETA  (thus giving not only bearing but also, through additional calculations, being relational to the range to the emitter).
      <br/>
      Such, however, is not the case.
      <br/>
      The difficulty arises because the receiver lacks information concerning fo.
      <br/>
      The procedure outlined above leads to a consistently undetermined set of linear equations in terms of a conventional solution.
      <br/>
      The difficulty could be resolved by recording maximum and minimum values of fD while the receiver executes a 360 (degree)  turn.
      <br/>
      However, such a method is considered to be totally unacceptable from an operational standpoint.
    </p>
    <p num="9">It is therefore desirable to provide a method for determining the range between a receiver and an emitter of electromagnetic energy of unknown frequency.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      According to one aspect, the invention is a method for determining the range to a source which emits electromagnetic energy having a substantially constant but unknown frequency.

    <heading>BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">Introduction</p>
    <p num="27">
      Consider a moving observer (or observers) attempting to locate a distant source of coherent electromagnetic radiation.
      <br/>
      Such a radar threat detection and location system must be continuously open (in both time and frequency) to all signals.
      <br/>
      Conventional search methods require highly directive, large-aperture antennas, which are difficult to install and which create substantial problems in design of advanced combat aircraft.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The inventive method of locating radar sources depends only on frequency measurements made from a moving observer to find both range and bearing of a target emitter.
      <br/>
      The methods use signal processing that takes advantage of the Doppler effect (observer and/or target must be moving).
      <br/>
      Since only frequency measurements are required, several small antennas (with dimensions, typically, of a few inches) will suffice for the necessary measurements.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Although the method and system as described can operate with a single small-aperture antenna, such an installation will, if the antenna is directed straight ahead (or behind), result in an ambiguity in emitter location between the right and left sides.
      <br/>
      To resolve such an ambiguity, two antennas, mounted so that each favors one side of the aircraft, are required.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Three cases will be considered in the following:</p>
    <p num="31">
      i. stationary source and one moving observer,
      <br/>
      ii. moving source and two moving observers,
      <br/>
      iii. moving source and one moving observer.
    </p>
    <p num="32">In all cases, only straight-line trajectories are considered in the following, although those skilled in the art will appreciate that appropriate signal processing will accommodate other known trajectories.</p>
    <p num="33">Stationary Source--One Observer</p>
    <p num="34">
      For this case, the observer requires a minimum of three apparent (Doppler-shifted) frequency measurements taken at three points on the observer's trajectory.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1A illustrates the geometry.
      <br/>
      The emitter is at location 20, while the receiver moves along straight-line trajectory 22 (containing observation points 24, 26, and 28).
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Note the following relations among the ranges ri (30i) and the angles  THETA i (32i):
      <br/>
      r1 cos  THETA 1 =r2 cos  THETA 2 +a=r3 cos  THETA 3 +a+b
      <br/>
      r1 sin  THETA 1 =r2 sin  THETA 2 =r3 sin  THETA 3.  1)
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      From these, the ranges can be found in several different ways, each solution depending on a different pair of angles.
      <br/>
      The range r1 can be expressed in two ways:  (Equation image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Let fo be the frequency of the emitter signal and c the velocity of light.
      <br/>
      The apparent frequencies of signals received at observation points 24, 26, and 28 along the observer's trajectory 22 are:  (Equation image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="38">The separations 34 and 36, between points 24 and 26 and points 26 and 28, respectively, are designated by dimensions a and b. Now let:  (Equation image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="39">
      For any constant  ALPHA 2, an infinity of numerator-denominator combinations will satisfy 4-a) and therefore from 2-a) the range r1 (301) can assume values along a curve (36) defined by 2-a) and 4-a).
      <br/>
      The same principle applies to 2-b) and 4-b) .
      <br/>
      Finally, note that  ALPHA 2 / ALPHA 3 yields an expression in the angles  THETA 2 and  THETA 3 (322 and 323) and still a third relation involving r2,  THETA 2 and  THETA 3 (302, 322, and 323) can be written as follows:  (Equation image '5' not included in text)

      FIG. 1B is a schematic diagram of one embodiment of the receiver of the inventive system.
      <br/>
      The receiver 100 is located on a platform 102, such as an aircraft, spacecraft, ground vehicle, or marine vehicle.
      <br/>
      The platform can be moved controllably by a means of motive power, such as engine 104, which is attached to the platform 102.
      <br/>
      The platform 102 carries a receiving antenna system 106, consisting of one or more antennas, which is adapted to receive signals from the emitter 20 (see FIG. 1A).
      <br/>
      If more than one antenna is utilized, the system 106 also includes a logic device 107 to select the antenna from which the strongest signal is available.
      <br/>
      The logic device 107 then provides an indication as to the sector from which said strongest signal originates, thereby eliminating the previously mentioned left-right ambiguity.
      <br/>
      The antenna system 106 is connected to a Doppler-shift receiver 108.
      <br/>
      The Doppler-shift receiver 108 produces a signal representing a received frequency of the signal produced by the emitter 20 and passes this signal to a frequency measurement circuit 110.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The receiver 100 also includes a clock 112.
      <br/>
      The clock 112 produces clock signals that can be used by the frequency measurement circuit 110.
      <br/>
      The receiver 100 also includes a computer 114 which receives the frequency measurement signals produced by the frequency measurement circuit 110 and also receives clock signals from the clock 112.
      <br/>
      The computer 114 includes a data memory 116, such as a random-access memory (RAM), for storage of data and a program memory 118, such as a read-only memory (ROM).
      <br/>
      The program memory 118 contains the program which the processing unit (not shown) of the computer 114 executes to perform the desired calculations and other tasks to be described subsequently.
      <br/>
      The computer 114 can be programmed by conventional means to perform the desired calculations and other tasks.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The receiver 100 can also include a communications receiver/transmitter 120 which is connected to an antenna 122.
      <br/>
      The communications receiver/transmitter 120 is connected to the computer 114, which both controls the communications receiver/transmitter 120 and processes data which are received or are to be transmitted by the communications receiver/transmitter 120.
      <br/>
      Through antenna 122 (or some equivalent means), the communications receiver/transmitter 120 can communicate with other receivers 100 or with other stations capable of receiving and/or transmitting data compatibly with the communications receiver/transmitter 120.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In typical situations, the receiver 100 can receive and process Doppler-frequency data which it produces itself and, if applicable, can receive Doppler-frequency data produced by other receivers and transmitted to receiver 100 through the antenna 122 and the communications receiver/transmitter 120.
      <br/>
      By use of the clock 112, the receiver 100 can process frequencies measured simultaneously by one or more receivers 100 under the control of the computer 114.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The computer 114 can be operated, in accordance with its program, to calculate frequency ratios and ranges from the calculated frequency ratios, as will be described in greater detail below.
      <br/>
      The computer 114 is also capable of expressing the range between the source and the receiver in terms of such frequency ratios, and of equating and solving (possibly iterating) such expressions for frequency ratios, by methods well known to those skilled in the computing arts.
      <br/>
      This will include expressing ranges in terms of solution fans, which are functions of Doppler-shifted frequencies.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The geometry for some typical values of  ALPHA 2 and  ALPHA 3 is shown in FIGS. 2A-2C. In each of these figures, the range vectors (301, 302, and 303) that terminate on the curves 36, satisfy the particular range equation for the measured frequency ratio.
      <br/>
      For example, in FIG. 2A, the dotted range lines indicate a typical solution for r1 (301) and r2 (302).
      <br/>
      Any pair of range vectors that originates at points O and P (24 and 26) and terminates at the same point 34 in the curve 361, is a solution pair, r1 and r2 for a constant  ALPHA 2.
      <br/>
      Similarly the range vector pair, r1 and r3 that originates at O and Q (24 and 28) and terminates at the same point 38 on the curve 362, determined by  ALPHA 3, is a solution pair for  ALPHA 3.
      <br/>
      Thus, the only solution set (r1, r2, r3) that satisfies both of the measurement constraints,  ALPHA 2 and  ALPHA 3 is the one for which all of the ranges terminate at the intersection of the solution curves 361 and 362 in the FIGS. 2A and 2B. This is illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B. FIG. 3A shows the unique solution point (34, 38, 40) for range and angle determination. (FIG. 3B is unnecessary, but it demonstrates that all correct range vectors meet at the intersection of the solution curves.)
    </p>
    <p num="47">To find the range and bearing analytically, substitute for  THETA 1,  THETA 2 and  THETA 3 in 2-a) and 2-b) from 4-a), 4-b), and 4-c) and obtain range equations as functions of  ALPHA 2,  ALPHA 3 and Y. Thus, 2-a) and 2-b) become:  (Equation image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="48">Each of these expressions for the range r1 represents a curve 36 (r1 v.  GAMMA ) and the intersection 34 of the two curves 361 and 362 determines the common solution (see FIG. 4) and therefore the only one that satisfies the constraints  ALPHA 2 and  ALPHA 3.</p>
    <p num="49">
      Analytically, the solution is found by equating 6-a) to 6-b) and solving for  GAMMA .
      <br/>
      That value of  GAMMA , say  GAMMA ' substituted back into 6-a) or 6-b), yields r1.
      <br/>
      Having found r1 and cos  THETA 3 all other ranges and angles can be found by manipulating the several range equations.
      <br/>
      For example, cos  THETA 3 may be found from:  (Equation image '7' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="50">and then r3 may be found from:  (Equation image '8' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="51">Moving Source--Two Observers</p>
    <p num="52">
      The second problem is akin to cooperative triangulation, i.e., there are two observers (e.g., receivers 100 as shown in FIG. 1B) and their data must be used together to find the radiation source.
      <br/>
      Either observer alone can find a relative solution and taken together the two relative solutions yield an unique absolute solution.
      <br/>
      In this problem, there are two unknowns in the frequency-angle relation, viz. fo and the velocity of the unknown radiation source.
      <br/>
      For that reason, four measurements are required.
      <br/>
      Again, frequency ratios are used and they are the principal key to the solution method.
      <br/>
      The ratios shown below eliminate fo and source velocity by cancellation.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate the method used to treat the case of observers moving in parallel straight-line trajectories and at the same (constant) velocity.
      <br/>
      The observing airplanes fly the straight-line trajectories AD and EH (42 and 44) while the emitting source flies the course OR (46) at a constant velocity.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The observers record frequency measurements simultaneously at times 0, t1, t1 +t2, and t1 +t2 +t3.
      <br/>
      Their respective positions at those times are (A, E), (B, F), (C, G), and (D, H) and the source is at O, P, Q, and R. Here f1, f2, f3 and f4 are the frequencies, fi, recorded at the four positions indicated above and the angles correspond to the frequencies in an obvious way.
      <br/>
      Let the observers' velocity be v and the source velocity u (with corresponding speeds, v and u).
      <br/>
      Then AB=EF=vt1, BC=FG=vt2, CD=GH=vt3 and OP=ut1, PQ=ut2 and QR=ut3.
      <br/>
      The lines of sight for each of the times (or positions) are shown for the left observer in FIG. 5A and for the right observer in FIG. 5B. The apparent frequencies (Doppler-shifted) sensed by the observers depend on closing velocities.
      <br/>
      Thus, at position A the left observer senses the frequency  (Equation image '9' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      where  PHI 11 and  PSI 11 are the angles between the "line of sight" 481 and the velocity vectors v (46) and u (481) respectively.
      <br/>
      The relationship between frequency and angle is given, as before, by fi =fo (1+v/c cos  THETA o) so the ratio of frequency differences is (f1 -f2)/(f1 -f3)=k1 =(cos  THETA 1 -cos  THETA 2)/(cos  THETA 1 -cos  THETA 3).
      <br/>
      Similar expressions obtain for other frequency ratios.
      <br/>
      In particular, (f2 -f3)/(f2 -f4)=k2, etc.
      <br/>
      The constants, k1 and k2 relate angles to each other and the dependence on fo and the source velocity has disappeared.
    </p>
    <p num="56">Refer now to FIGS. 6A-B and 7 and note that the frequency can be written as:  (Equation image '10' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="57">where w (OT) 52 is the vector sum of v (46) and u (50) and  THETA 11 is the angle between the line of sight 54 and w. All other frequencies are derived in the same way.</p>
    <p num="58">
      In what follows, the subscript that identifies the right and left observers is dropped and only one subscript is used.
      <br/>
      The subscript identifies position or time.
      <br/>
      Thus, apparent frequencies at times 1, t1, t1 +t2, and t1 +t3 are taken to be f1, f2, f3, and f4.
    </p>
    <p num="59">Consider now the relative observation geometry for either observer.</p>

    <p num="62">
      In order to find the ranges, ratios are formed, much the same as for the stationary source.

      The result is a function of cos  THETA 2, cos  THETA 3 and k1.
      <br/>
      In the third equation of 7), substitute for  THETA 4 from the second equation in 9).
      <br/>
      The result is a function of cos  THETA 2, cos  THETA 3 and k2.
      <br/>
      Since k1 and k2 are measured quantities, there are three expressions for r2/w as a function of the two variables cos  THETA 2 and cos  THETA 3.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Thus, the following relations result:
      <br/>
      (r2/w)I=g1 (cos  THETA 2, cos  THETA 3)
      <br/>
      (r2/w)II=g2 (cos  THETA 2, cos  THETA 3, k1)

      (r2/w)III=g3 (cos  THETA 2, cos  THETA 3, k2)  10)

    <p num="66">
      Each of these equations represents a surface 56 in the three-dimensional space defined by coordinates r2/w, cos  THETA 2, cos  THETA 3.
      <br/>
      The unique intersection of the three surfaces 56 yields the only solution for r2/w common to the three surfaces.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      A computer program, easily programmed in a conventional manner and contained in the program memory 118 (see FIG. 1B), can be used to find the intersection (solution) for any (f1, f2, f3, f4) input set.
      <br/>
      This procedure is done for each of the two observers, so that two solution sets are obtained.
      <br/>
      Since w is unknown, one solution set will not suffice for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p num="68">Thus, for each observer, there is a solution set which will be referred to as a solution "fan."</p>
    <p num="69">
      With reference to FIGS. 9A and 9B, the solution for each fan 57 yields the angles ( THETA 1,  THETA 2,  THETA 3,  THETA 4).
      <br/>
      The ranges (r1, r2, r3, r4) lie along the range lines 30 in FIG. 10, but the actual range is not known.
      <br/>
      The distance wt 58 lies on one of the parallel lines 60 and there is an infinite number of such solutions.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Furthermore, the solution fans 57L and 57R can respectively be rotated about A and E and assume any of an infinite number of angular positions.
      <br/>
      In order to get an absolute solution from the two relative solutions, the true closing velocity vectors must coincide, i.e., the vector for the left fan 57L must be the same as the one for the right fan 57R.
      <br/>
      Thus, the fans 57 are rotated so that the solution Vectors are parallel.
      <br/>
      The line 60' joining the intersection of the two r1 lines (one for each fan 57) and the intersection of the two r4 lines is one of the candidate solutions.
      <br/>
      This line, then is the true solution.
      <br/>
      Figures 11A-D illustrate how the two sets of relative solutions are resolved to find the (unique) true solution 60.

    <p num="71">
      The method for finding the true solution as shown above, has intuitive appeal, but "fan matching" is probably expensive in terms of computer storage.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an alternate (algebraic) method is available.
      <br/>
      Consider one of the ranges, say r2.

      Recalling the relative geometry for one of the observers, the parallelogram OSTR defines the several velocities.

      The angle,  ZETA  is related to other (known) angles as follows:  (Equation image '15' not included in text)

    <p num="81">
      The one-observer problem is solved in exactly the same way as the two-observer problem; but, since all the data must be collected by one observer, some penalties must be expected.
      <br/>
      For the two-observer case, the data are collected along parallel trajectories, so one observer, such as receiver 100 (see FIG. 1), must execute a maneuver.
      <br/>
      Part of the data (the first four frequency measurements) is recorded on one substantially straight-line trajectory and the other part of the data (the second group of four frequency measurements) is recorded on a parallel, substantially straight-line trajectory.
      <br/>
      This method, of course, requires more time than the two-observer method.
      <br/>
      Refer to FIG. 13 for a geometrical description.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Recall that in the two-observer case, each observer was stipulated to make his measurements at exactly the same times as the other observer makes his.
      <br/>
      From FIG. 13, it is clear that such a measurement schedule is not possible.
      <br/>
      However, in what follows it will be shown how a "phantom" measurement set can be created with only the knowledge of the first measurement set.
      <br/>
      This process is called "fan iteration."
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      First, the solution fan using the first four frequency measurements is calculated.
      <br/>
      Assuming that the observer continues on the same straight-line trajectory at a constant velocity (dotted line in FIG. 13) the solution fans 57 that would result at each of the time points after the first can be derived from the first one.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Consider the first iteration.
      <br/>
      Recall how the "relative geometry" fan 57 is constructed.
      <br/>
      From FIGS. 5A-D and 6A-B note that the line-of-sight vectors 482 -484 (left observer) originating at B, C, and D (FIG. 5A) are all translated so that they originate at A (FIG. 6A).
      <br/>
      If a fan 57 which originates at B is constructed, those line-of-sight vectors 483 and 484 originating at C, D, and a fifth measurement point would be translated to B, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      Note that the second line-of-sight vector 482 in the "A" fan is parallel to the first line-of-sight vector 482 in the "B" fan and that the third vector in the "A" fan is parallel to the second vector in the "B" fan, etc.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to construct a fan 57 originating at any point B, C, D, etc. (all equally spaced), without actually collecting data (frequency measurements) at those points along the dotted line in FIG. 13. Those solution fans are referred to as phantom or iterated fans.
      <br/>
      An iterated fan can be treated exactly as though it were a fan derived from real measurements.
      <br/>
      Measurements made along a constant velocity flight trajectory would indeed be exactly the same as those derived from the first group of four.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Now it is easy to apply the methods of the previous section.
      <br/>
      Another solution fan calculated from measurement points along a parallel trajectory (after the maneuver) is used with the iterated fan to complete the solution for absolute values of range, bearing and velocities.
      <br/>
      The calculation for the angles is a little more complicated than the similar calculation in the two-observer case.
      <br/>
      FIG. 15 shows a portion of FIG. 14 which has been enlarged and had pertinent lengths and angles added.
      <br/>
      Note that d, the distance between the observer and the other reference point ("phantom" observer) is known because the observer's maneuver is known.
      <br/>
      For the same reason, the angle  DELTA , is known.
      <br/>
      The distance rR and rL are calculated using 10).
      <br/>
      Then  ZETA  can be found from:  (Equation image '17' not included in text)

      The accuracy of range and bearing determined by methods disclosed herein is dependent on measurement accuracies of the frequencies.
      <br/>
      Other factors also contribute, but the errors in apparent frequencies are the dominant contributors.

    <p num="88">
      The error analysis conducted in conjunction with the developments described in this disclosure shows that the methods are feasible.
      <br/>
