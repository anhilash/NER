    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention generally relates to pulley mechanisms and, more particularly, is concerned with a tree stand hoist assembly and a casing therefor having identical mating casing halves.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Hunting wild game is a popular activity.
      <br/>
      Hunters often find it useful to position themselves above the ground, such as on trees.
      <br/>
      Tree stands are employed for this purpose.
      <br/>
      Hunters are less likely to be spotted or scented by game and have a better view of the surrounding terrain at elevated positions.
      <br/>
      A challenge for hunters, however, is getting a tree stand and other items on a tree at a desired position above the ground.
      <br/>
      Tree stands generally may be constructed on a tree, may be used in climbing the tree or may be raised onto the tree.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Various devices have been developed over the years for raising items, such as tree stands and the like, to higher elevations.
      <br/>
      Representative examples of prior art pulley mechanisms and the like are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 723,231 to Benedict, U.S. Pat. No. 1,107,934 to Hagan, U.S. Pat. No. 1,167,295 to Hall, U.S. Pat. No. 1,243,107 to Richardson, U.S. Pat. No. 1,399,182 to Benedict, U.S. Pat. No. 1,961,081 to Schrader, U.S. Pat. No. 2,292,353 to Ennis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 2,532,893 to Crotty, U.S. Pat. No. 4,097,023 to Muller, U.S. Pat. No. 5,603,489 to Regal, U.S. Pat. No. 5,607,143 to Regal and U.S. Pat. No. 5,615,865 to Fountain.
      <br/>
      While these prior art devices may be satisfactory in use for the specific purposes for which they were designed, none of them seem to provide a simple and effective solution for raising tree stands and the like to desired elevated positions.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Consequently, a need still exists for an assembly which provides an optimum solution to the aforementioned problem in the prior art without introducing any new problems in place thereof.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention provides a tree stand hoist assembly and a casing therefor designed to satisfy the aforementioned need.
      <br/>
      The hoist assembly of the present invention employs a casing, a pulley mechanism and a latch mechanism to assist a hunter in raising a tree stand or any other suitable item, such as game, to a desired elevation on a tree.
      <br/>
      The casing of the present invention has an aperture for receiving a fastener member, such as a hanger, hook, peg, step and the like, therethrough for supporting the casing on a tree at a predetermined height.
      <br/>
      The casing also employs identical mating halves for efficiency and cost-savings in the manufacturing process due to the need for only one mold.
      <br/>
      The hoist assembly and casing therefor are a simple and effective solution for raising tree stands and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a hoist assembly which comprises: (a) a casing having a lower end, an aperture formed through the casing and an interior chamber defined in the casing, the aperture for receiving a fastener member therethrough for supporting the casing on a tree at a predetermined height, the interior chamber being open at the lower end of the casing; (b) a pulley mechanism including (i) a pulley rotatably mounted to and disposed within the interior chamber of the casing between the aperture and lower end of the casing, and (ii) a cable having opposite first and second end portions and being entrained over the pulley and extending downwardly through the interior chamber and exteriorly of the lower end of the casing, the first opposite end portion for attachment of an item thereto and the second opposite end portion for a user to grip for pulling the second opposite end portion downward to thereby rotate the pulley in a first direction and raise the item attached to the first opposite end portion; and (c) a latch mechanism including (1) a latching pawl pivotally mounted to and disposed within the interior chamber of the casing and being movable between a locked position and an unlocked position, the latching pawl in the locked position engaging and wedging the cable against the pulley so as to prevent the cable and therewith the pulley from moving in a second direction opposite the first direction and thereby retain the item attached to the first opposite end portion of the cable in place, the latching pawl in the unlocked position being shifted away from the cable such that the cable and the item are thereby free to move, an (ii) means for moving the latching pawl between the locked position and unlocked position.</p>
    <p num="9">
      More particularly, the casing has an upper end spaced opposite the lower end and a pair of spaced opposite sides extending between the upper and lower ends.
      <br/>
      The aperture of the casing is spaced below the upper end of the casing but disposed closer to the upper end than to the lower end of the casing and approximately halfway between the opposite sides of the casing.
      <br/>
      The casing also has a centering recess formed therein in communication with the aperture for receiving a portion of the fastener member therein for balancing the casing on the fastener member.
      <br/>
      The casing further has a pair of spaced apart openings at the lower end of the casing for passage of the cable therethrough.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The present invention is also directed to the casing for the hoist assembly.
      <br/>
      The casing comprises: (a) a pair of identical mateable front and rear casing halves; and (b) means for fastening the front and rear casing halves together in a mated relationship; (c) the front and rear casing halves in the mated relationship together forming a lower end of the casing and an interior chamber open at the lower end of the casing; (d) the front and rear halves also including first means for mounting the pulley mechanism within the interior chamber and second means for mounting the latch mechanism within the interior chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      More particularly, the front and rear casing halves in the mated relationship together define the aperture for receiving a fastener member therethrough for supporting the casing on a tree at a predetermined height and the centering recess in communication with the aperture for receiving a portion of the fastener member therein for balancing the casing on the fastener member.
      <br/>
      The front and rear casing halves in the mated relationship together define the pair of spaced apart openings at lower end portions of the front and rear casing halves for passage of the cable of the pulley mechanism therethrough.
      <br/>
      Each of the front and rear casing halves includes a main wall and a continuous side wall.
      <br/>
      The main wall has an exterior surface, an interior surface, a pair of diagonally opposite first and second corners, a pair of diagonally opposite third and fourth corners and a periphery.
      <br/>
      The side wall is mounted to and extends outwardly from the interior surface at the periphery of the main wall.
      <br/>
      The first means for mounting the pulley of the pulley mechanism within the interior chamber and the second means for mounting the latch mechanism within the interior chamber are formed on the interior surfaces of the front and rear casing halves.
    </p>
    <p num="12">These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings wherein there is shown and described an illustrative embodiment of the invention.</p>

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to the drawings and particularly to FIGS. 1, 2 and 5, there is illustrated a tree stand hoist assembly, generally designated 10, of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Basically, the hoist assembly 10 includes a casing 12, a pulley mechanism 14 and a latch mechanism 16.
      <br/>
      The casing 12 has opposite upper and lower ends 12A, 12B and an interior chamber 18.
      <br/>
      The interior chamber 18 is open at the lower end 12B of the casing 12.
      <br/>
      The casing 12 also has a pair of spaced opposite sides 12C extending between the upper and lower ends 12A, 12B.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The pulley mechanism 14 includes a pulley 20 and a cable 22.
      <br/>
      The pulley 20 is rotatably mounted to and disposed within the interior chamber 18 of the casing 12.
      <br/>
      The cable 22 has opposite first and second end portions 22A, 22B and is entrained over the pulley 20 and extends downwardly through the interior chamber 18 and exteriorly of the lower end 12B of the casing 12.
      <br/>
      The first opposite end portion 22A of the cable 22 is for attachment of an item I, such as a deer, as shown in FIG. 1, thereto.
      <br/>
      The second opposite end portion 22B of the cable 22 is for a user (not shown) to grip for pulling the second opposite end portion 22B downward to thereby rotate the pulley in a first direction D1 and raise the item I attached to the first opposite end portion 22A.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The latch mechanism 16 includes a latching pawl 24 and means for moving the latching pawl 24.
      <br/>
      The latching pawl 24 is pivotally mounted to and disposed within the interior chamber 18 of the casing 12.
      <br/>
      The latching pawl 24 is movable between a locked position, as shown in solid line form in FIGS. 2 and 4, and an unlocked position, as shown in broken line form in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The latching pawl 24 in the locked position engages and wedges the cable 22 of the pulley mechanism 14 against the pulley 20 of the pulley mechanism 14 and thereby prevents the cable 22 from moving in a second direction D2 opposite the first direction D1 and thereby retains the item I attached to the first opposite end portion 22A of the cable 22 in place.
      <br/>
      The latching pawl 24 in the unlocked position is shifted away from the cable 22 such that the cable 22 and the item I are free to move.
      <br/>
      The moving means is, particularly, for moving the latching pawl 24 between the locked position and the unlocked position.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In accordance with the present invention, the casing 12 has means in the form of an aperture 26 formed through the casing 12 for facilitating the supporting of the casing 12 on a tree T at a predetermined height, such as seen in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The aperture 26 is sized for receiving therethrough a fastener member F, such as a hook, step peg or the like, attached to the tree T for supporting the casing 12 on the tree T. The aperture 26 has a substantially rectangular configuration with rounded corners and is spaced below the upper end 12A of the casing 12 but disposed closer to the upper end 12A than to the lower end 12B of the casing 12.
      <br/>
      Also, the aperture 26 is disposed approximately halfway between the opposite sides 12C of the casing 12.
      <br/>
      The casing 12 also has a centering recess 28 formed through the casing 12 in communication with the aperture 26 for receiving a portion of the fastener member F therein for balancing the casing 12 on the fastener member F. The centering recess 28 is defined on top of the aperture 26 and is spaced from but disposed closer to the upper end 12A of the casing 12 than is the aperture 26.
      <br/>
      The centering recess 28 has a substantially semicircular configuration for mating with a rounded portion of the fastener member F also having a substantially circular configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring now to FIGS. 1 to 3 and 5, the casing 12 has a substantially rectangular configuration with the opposite upper and lower ends 12A, 12B and opposite sides 12C being connected so as to form the four corners 12D.
      <br/>
      The upper and lower ends 12A, 12B have substantially the same lengths.
      <br/>
      The lengths of the opposite sides 12C are substantially the same but slightly less than the lengths of the upper and lower ends 12A, 12B.
      <br/>
      The corners 12D are rounded and protrude slightly from the casing 12.
      <br/>
      The casing 12 defines a pair of spaced apart openings 30 at the lower end 12B of the casing 12 for passage of the cable 22 of the pulley mechanism 14 therethrough.
      <br/>
      Each opening 30 has a substantially rectangular configuration and is spaced from but disposed closer to a respective one of the sides 12C than to the other of the sides 12C of the casing 12 and disposed closer to the respective one side 12C than to the other opening 30.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Also, in accordance with the present invention, the casing 12 has a pair of identical mating front and rear casing halves 32, 34.
      <br/>
      Each of the front and rear casing halves 32, 34 includes a main wall 36 and a continuous side wall 38.
      <br/>
      Also, the casing 12 includes means for detachably fastening the halves 32, 34 together in the form of a pair of opposite first and second seats 40, a pair of opposite first and second lugs 42, a pair of opposite first and second receptacles 44 and a plurality of fasteners 46.
      <br/>
      The main wall 36 has an exterior surface 36A, an interior surface 36B, a pair of diagonally opposite first and second corners 36C, a pair of diagonally opposite third and fourth corners 36D, and a periphery 36E.
      <br/>
      The main wall 36 has a substantially rectangular configuration.
      <br/>
      The corners 36C, 36D are rounded and protrude slightly from each of the front and rear casing halves 32, 34.
      <br/>
      The side wall 38 is mounted to and extends outwardly from the interior surface 36B at the periphery 36E of the main wall 36 and has a height substantially less than the width of the main wall 36.
      <br/>
      The main walls 36 and continuous side walls 38 of the respective front and rear casing halves 32, 34 together define the interior chamber 18 therebetween.
      <br/>
      Each side wall 38 defines half of each of the openings 30 at the lower end 12B of the casing 12.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The first and second seats 40 are identical to the other and have generally circular configurations.
      <br/>
      Each of the first and second seats 40 defines an opening 52 having a generally circular configuration.
      <br/>
      The first seat 40 is formed on and extends inwardly from the exterior surface 36A spaced from but disposed adjacent to the first corner 36C of the main wall 36.
      <br/>
      The second seat 40 is formed on and extends inwardly from the exterior surface 36A spaced from but disposed adjacent to the second corner 36C diagonally opposite from the first corner 36C of the main wall 36.
