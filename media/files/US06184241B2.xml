    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to aspartic protease inhibitors, in particular to HIV protease, renin, pepsin and cathepsin D inhibitors.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The inhibitors described below can be used for a number of aspartic proteases, such as HIV protease, renin, pepsin and cathepsin D. However, for ease of discussion, reference will be made to applying the described inhibitors to HIV protease.
      <br/>
      It will be well understood that optimization of inhibitors for renin, pepsin and cathepsin D may be required.
      <br/>
      The nature and scope of inhibitor modifications for such optimization will be readily apparent in view of the discussion below.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encodes an aspartic protease whose function is essential for proper virion assembly and maturation.
      <br/>
      Inactivation of HIV protease either by mutation or chemical inhibition leads to the production of immature, non-infectious viral particles.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in attempts to find a drug for the treatment of AIDS, efforts have been directed to inhibitors of HIV protease.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      HIV protease is unique in the family of aspartic proteases in that it is a homodimer which displays C2 symmetry about the active site.
      <br/>
      The dimer is made up of two identical sub-units each contributing an aspartate residue to form a single active site.
      <br/>
      Known inhibitors are designed to inactivate HIV protease by interaction with the carboxylic acid functional group of one or both of the aspartic acid residues in the active site.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the absence of a substrate, a water molecule bridges the two carboxyl groups of the aspartic acid residues by hydrogen bonding to two oxygen atoms; one from each of the carboxyl groups.
      <br/>
      In the active form of the enzyme, the two carboxyl groups thus interact closely and share one proton between them.
      <br/>
      Because of this interaction, one of the carboxyl groups has a lower pKa value, typically about 1.5, while the other carboxyl group has a higher pKa, value, typically about 4.7.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Reduced amide inhibitors were among the earliest HIV protease inhibitors.</p>
    <p num="7">
      One of the more notable of these inhibitors is known as MVT-101.
      <br/>
      While the inhibitor does show activity against HIV protease, it is believed that the lack of functionality with the reduced amide (--CH2 --NH--) for hydrogen bonding to the aspartic acid residues is responsible for the moderate potency of the reduced amide inhibitors (Kempf, D. J. et al. Current Pharmaceutical Design 2:2:225-246; 1996).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Accordingly, most of the conventional inhibitors developed to date are the "so-called" transition-state analogs.
      <br/>
      Examples of transition-state analogs include statine-, hydroxyethylene- and hydroxyethylamine-containing inhibitors.
      <br/>
      These transition-state analog inhibitors share the common feature of a central hydroxyl group for hydrogen bonding to the carboxyl groups of the two aspartic acid residues in the active site.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The accepted mechanism of action for transition-state analog inhibitors is that the central hydroxyl group of the inhibitor replaces the water molecule that was bound in the active site of the enzyme in the absence of a substrate or inhibitor.
      <br/>
      The hydroxyl group acts as both a transition-state inhibitor and as a hydrogen bond donor-acceptor.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A common feature of hydroxyethylamine inhibitors is the presence of amine groups separated from the central hydroxyl group by 2 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      No apparent interaction has been observed between the aspartic acid residues and the amine groups in the inhibitors (Huff, J. R. Medicinal Chemistry 34:8:2305-2314;1991).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In addition to the principal interaction between the central hydroxyl group and one or both of the carboxyl groups of the aspartic acid residues, there are a number of hydrogen bonds formed between the side chains of the inhibitor and sub-sites of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      The sub-sites of most interest in inhibitor design are termed the S1, S1 ', S2 and S2 ' sub-sites.
      <br/>
      Hydrogen bonding and other interactions between the atoms of the side chains and sub-sites helps stabilize the inhibitor in the active site of HIV protease (Wlodawer et al.
      <br/>
      Annu Rev Biochem 62:543-85; 1993).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Also, HIV protease has a pair of  BETA -hairpin flaps that cover the active site.
      <br/>
      These flaps interact with the substrate or inhibitor to tightly bind a water molecule.
      <br/>
      This interaction is illustrated in Huff, J. R. (ibid) as being hydrogen bonds formed by the flap IIe50 and IIe50 ' amide hydrogen atoms and the inhibitor carbonyl oxygen atoms on either side of a central hydroxyl group which hydrogen bonds to the aspartic acid residues.
      <br/>
      Thus, the water molecule bridges the inhibitor and the flaps.
      <br/>
      In the contracted conformation, the flaps form a pocketed hydrophobic tube shielding about 80% of the bound inhibitor from surrounding solvent (Huff, J. R., ibid).
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      One of the disadvantages of some of the known inhibitors is the poor pharmacokinetic properties and bioavailability of peptide analog inhibitors.
      <br/>
      High lipophilicity, high molecular weights, and the presence of numerous amide bonds contribute to less desirable pharmacokinetic properties and metabolic instability.
      <br/>
      Some researchers have therefore designed inhibitors in which an amide bond of a known tripeptide analog inhibitor has been replaced by an imidazole substituent, resulting in a substantial improvement of the pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability of the inhibitor (Abdel-Meguid, S. S. et al. Biochemistry 33:39:11671-7; 1994).
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Abdel-Meguid et al. disclose a hydroxyethylene tripeptide analog inhibitor in which the C-terminal carboxamide is replaced with imidazole to produce (2R,4S,5S,1'S)-2-phenylmethyl-4-hydroxyl-5-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino-6-phenylhexanoyl-N-(1'-imidazo-2-yl)-2'-methylpropanamide.
      <br/>
      The central hydroxyl group interacts with the carboxyl groups of the active site aspartic acid residues.
      <br/>
      The imidazole replaced the carbonyl oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the C-terminal carboxamide that formed hydrogen bonds with the Asp29  ALPHA -amino group and the Gly48 carbonyl group of the HIV protease.
      <br/>
      The imidazole ring provides improved solubility, which may allow more efficient uptake of the inhibitor into the intestinal mucosa.
      <br/>
      It is also believed that the imidazole substitution favorably influences metabolic stability and clearance.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Disadvantages of inhibitors known to date include poor solubility, metabolic stability and bioavailability.
      <br/>
      Also, synthesis of these inhibitors is complicated due to the number of asymmetric centers in each compound.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Accordingly, there is a need for aspartic protease inhibitors that have the potential for improved in vivo performance, and which are comparatively more economical and easier to synthesize.</p>

    <p num="26">
      The HIV protease inhibitors of the present invention interact with the catalytic aspartic acid residues in the active site of HIV protease to inhibit the action thereof.
      <br/>
      The HIV protease inhibitors of the present invention have a 3 to 12-membered heterocyclic ring containing at least two heteroatoms which interact with the carboxyl groups of the aspartic acid residues.
      <br/>
      This is in contrast to the majority of known inhibitors where the functional group for bonding to the carboxyl groups of the aspartic acid residues of HIV protease is a hydroxyl group.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The compounds of the present invention are illustrated by the following general formula (I)
      <br/>
      Z--Het--Z   (I)
    </p>
    <p num="28">wherein Het is a saturated, partially unsaturated or unsaturated and substituted or unsubstituted 3 to 12-membered heterocyclic ring having at least two heteroatoms and each Z can be the same or different, and has a shape complementarity with at least a portion of the substrate binding site of the protease; a chemical structure for contacting multiple atoms of the substrate binding site; and at least one R group, which can be the same or different, at least one R group having a chemical structure for occupying at least one sub-site, proximate to the active site of the aspartic protease.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The heterocycle provides (1) a heterocyclic conformational constraint with (2) a suitable pKa value (3) for interaction with the carboxyl functional groups of the active site aspartic acid residues.
      <br/>
      Each of these features is discussed in more detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      First, the heterocyclic core provides conformational constraint for presentation of the R groups to sub-sites in the active site of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      The conformational constraint may result in R groups that are defined by torsion angles of 0 (degree)  to approximately 120 (degree)  between one another.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The heterocyclic core may be saturated, partially unsaturated or unsaturated.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the heterocycle is a 3 to 10-membered ring.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the heterocycle is a 3 to 7-membered ring and most preferably, a 5 to 7-membered ring.
      <br/>
      Unsaturated and aromatic rings are inherently planar and will provide a higher degree of conformational constraint than will the saturated counterparts.
      <br/>
      Planar aromatic heterocycles are comparatively easily synthesized and commercially available.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the heterocyclic core is at least partially unsaturated proximate the heteroatoms.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      While not as preferred, saturated heterocydes will also offer conformational constraint even though such heterocycles are not planar.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, saturated heterocycles can be used in the inhibitors of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The conformational analysis of small ring structures, i.e., 3 to 6 atoms, is well-known and predictable.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Second, the heterocyclic ring must be chosen to have a proper pKa value to allow for an amphoteric acid-base interaction with the two catalytic aspartic acid residues.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the pKa value is in the range of from about 2.5 to about 12.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the pKa value is in the range of from about 5 to about 7.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Third, the heterocyclic ring has hydrogen bond complementarity for concurrent association with the two carboxylic acid groups of the aspartic protease.
      <br/>
      The resulting protonation states of the two carboxylic acid groups and the heterocyclic ring stabilizes the enzyme-inhibitor complex.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The heterocycle has at least two heteroatoms which interact with the two carboxyl groups of the active site aspartic acid residues.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the heterocycle has 2 to 4 heteroatoms.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the heterocycle has 2 to 3 heteroatoms and most preferably, two heteroatoms.
      <br/>
      Suitable heteroatoms of the heterocycle include nitrogen, phosphorous, oxygen, sulfur, boron, silicon and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Preferably, at least one of the heteroatoms is nitrogen.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the heterocycle has two nitrogen atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Examples of suitable heterocycles include, without limitation, imidazole, imidazolidine, pyrazole, triazole, oxazole, thiazole, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, piperazine, triazine, oxazine and 1,4 diazobicyclo-2,2,2-octane.</p>
    <p num="37">
      In addition to the appended Z groups, the heterocyclic core may be substituted or unsubstituted.
      <br/>
      Examples of substituents include, without limitation, acyl, aldehyde, alkyl, amido, amino, aryl, carboxamide, carboxyl, ether, halo, hydroxyl, nitro, oxime, sulfonyl, and sulfoxide groups.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the interactions between the heterocyclic inhibitors of the present invention and the aspartic acid residues in the active site is that of (1) a general acid-general base, (2) a simple base or (3) a combination thereof.
      <br/>
      These types of interactions are illustrated below, without limitation, in Scheme 1 wherein the heterocycle is an imidazole ring.  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The two structures in interaction A of Scheme 1 are equivalent because it does not matter which carboxylic acid is shown as deprotonated.
      <br/>
      The transfer of a proton from the second aspartate to the imidazole can also yield two equivalent structures shown in interaction B of Scheme 1.
      <br/>
      These structures can all coexist and, on the basis of the reported pKa values of the catalytic aspartate residues (pKa1 and pKa2 are 1.5 and 4.7, respectively) and that of an imidazole ring pKa =6.0-7.0), it is believed that about 10% of interaction A would be present along with about 90% of interaction B.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The nitrogen atoms of imidazole are separated by an intermediary carbon atom.
      <br/>
      Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the relatively acidic C--H group in the imidazole ring can provide further stabilization of the inhibitor/protease interaction.
      <br/>
      This additional interaction is depicted in Scheme 2 below.  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="41">The interactions between the nitrogen atoms of the imidazole ring and the carboxyl groups of the active-site aspartic acid residues are believed to be the same as those depicted in Scheme 1.</p>
    <p num="42">
      The proton transfer shown in A and B of Scheme 1 allows for all of the interactions to co-exist in the inhibitors of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This is in contrast to known inhibitors discussed in the background section herein which do not provide for these types of interactions.
      <br/>
      Also, the additional stabilization provided by interaction with the hydrogen atom pendant to an intermediate carbon atom is not provided in the known inhibitors.
    </p>
    <p num="43">The proposed interaction between another inhibitor of the present invention, such inhibitor containing a pyrazole heterocycle, and the carboxyl groups of the active-site aspartic acid residues of HIV protease is illustrated in Scheme 3 below.  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="44">
      As depicted above, there is no intermediate C--H group between the two nitrogen atoms of the pyrazole group.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there is no additional interaction between the heterocycle and the carboxyl groups of the aspartic acid residues.
      <br/>
      However, the pyrazole is much more acidic than the imidazole (i.e., pKa =2.5 v. pKa =6.0-7.0) and is also able to transfer a proton to the carboxyl group.
      <br/>
      Similar to Scheme 1, the two structures in interaction A of Scheme 3 are equivalent because it does not matter which carboxylic acid is shown as deprotonated.
      <br/>
      The transfer of a proton from the second aspartate to the pyrazole can also yield two equivalent structures shown in interaction B of Scheme 3.
      <br/>
      These structures can all coexist and, on the basis of the reported pKa values of the catalytic aspartate residues (PKa1 and pKa2 are 1.5 and 4.7, respectively) and that of an pyrazole ring (pKa= 2.5), it is believed that about 99% of interaction A would be present along with about 1% of interaction B.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The Z groups appended to the heterocyclic core of the inhibitors of the present invention are selected to complement the remaining features of the substrate-binding site, as will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
    <p num="46">Each Z group can be the same or different, and has (a) a shape complementarity with at least a portion of the substrate binding site of the protease, (b) a chemical structure for contacting multiple atoms of the substrate binding site, and (c) at least one R group, which can be the same or different, at least one R group having a chemical structure for occupying at least one sub-site, proximate to the active site of the aspartic protease.</p>
    <p num="47">Inhibitors of the present invention, having a heterocyclic core and Z groups selected according to the above criteria, will have 3 or more of the following properties: (1) improved binding constant (i.e., potency) of the inhibitor to the enzyme; (2) low plasma protein binding; (3) an overall chemical structure which allows for water solubility; (4) an overall chemical structure which allows for complete tissue distribution; (5) improved oral bioavailability; (6) metabolically stable chemical functional groups; (7) a molecular weight less than about 600 to reduce potential elimination problems; (8) improved resistance to mutant viruses; and (9) functional groups which avoid metabolic problems or potential drug interactions.</p>
    <p num="48">
      The Z group is selected to provide shape complementarity with at least a portion of the substrate binding site of the protease.
      <br/>
      Research efforts have led to X-ray crystal structures which characterize, on an atomic level, the structure of HIV protease.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, surfaces and cavities in the substrate binding site have been identified.
      <br/>
      It is therefore possible, using structure-based design (discussed in more detail below), to select and/or assess the shape of an inhibitor for its complementarity to the shape of the substrate binding site.
      <br/>
      The shape of the Z groups are selected to have a shape which is complementary to the enzyme substrate binding site.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The Z group is also selected to provide contacts between the inhibitor and the enzyme.
      <br/>
      Contacts are defined as chemical, physical and/or physicochemical interactions.
      <br/>
      Contacting distances are preferably interatomic distances of &lt; about 4.1  Angstrom  for non-hydrogen atoms.
      <br/>
      The number of contacts of conventional inhibitors is presented in Wlodawer et al. (ibid) as ranging from 123 to 181.
      <br/>
      It is believed that the improved binding between the aspartate residues and the inhibitor of the present invention, as well as the conformational constraint provided by the heterocyclic core of the present invention will allow for smaller Z groups and therefore a reduced number of contacts will be required to stabilize the inhibitor/protease complex.
      <br/>
      For example, the number of contacts between atoms of the inhibitor and atoms of the substrate-binding site may be as low as about 50 contacts.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      For example, preferably a Z group of an HIV protease inhibitor of the present invention has a functional group for binding to the amide groups of the flap IIe50 and IIe50' residues, either directly or indirectly through a water molecule.
      <br/>
      The functional group is preferably a hydrogen bond-accepting group such as, for example, a carbonyl group, a sulfoxide group, a sulfone group, a phosphine oxide group, an amine oxide group or a hydroxylamine group.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Each Z group preferably has at least one substituent R group to occupy one or more of the S1, S1 ', S2 and S2 ' sub-sites.
      <br/>
      The S1 /S1 ' sub-sites are principally hydrophobic binding pockets.
      <br/>
      The S2 /S2 ' sub-sites have dual hydrophobic and hydrophilic (i.e., amphoteric) character.
      <br/>
      Some conventional HIV protease inhibitors have been prepared using hydrophobic residues with hydrogen bonding functional groups to improve overall properties.
      <br/>
      Preferably, Z is a moiety with one or more atoms selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, boron, silicon, phosphorus, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine and combinations thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The Z groups may be symmetrical or asymmetrical.
      <br/>
      HIV protease is a homodimer made up of two identical sub-units.
      <br/>
      The homodimer displays C2 symmetry about the active site.
      <br/>
      Many of the conventional inhibitors are asymmetric, even though HIV protease is symmetric about the active site.
      <br/>
      Asymmetric inhibitors often bind in a manner to conserve sub-site symmetry in the complex and conventional symmetrical inhibitors do not always provide improved properties (Wlodawer et al., ibid).
      <br/>
      It is believed that the heterocyclic core of the inhibitors of the present invention will allow for symmetrical Z groups, because the rigid structural heterocyclic core is placed at the C2 axis within the enzyme active site, thereby forming an inhibitor with C2 symmetry.
      <br/>
      An inhibitor with such symmetry is expected to have improved potency versus conventional symmetric inhibitors.
    </p>
    <p num="53">In one embodiment of the present invention, an HIV protease inhibitor of the present invention is represented by the following general formula (II):  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="54">where Het is a saturated, partially unsaturated or unsaturated and substituted or unsubstituted 3 to 12-membered heterocyclic ring containing at least two heteroatoms; X is a hydrogen bond-accepting group; Y is a moiety having a backbone chain of at least 2 atoms sufficient to present at least one of R1, R1', R2 and R2' to the S1, S1 ', S2 and S2 ' sub-sites, respectively; at least one of R1, R1', R2 and R2' having a chemical structure to occupy the S1, S1 ', S2 and S2 ' sub-sites; and n is 0, 1, 2 or 3.</p>
    <p num="55">Examples of X are, without limitation, carbonyl, sulfoxide, sulfone, phosphine oxide, amine oxide or hydroxylamine groups.</p>
    <p num="56">Preferably, R1 is a group selected to occupy the S1 sub-site, R1' is a group selected to occupy the S1 ' sub-site and is the same as or different than R1, R2 is a group selected to occupy the S2 sub-site, R2' is a group selected to occupy the S2 ' sub-site and is the same as or different than R2.</p>
    <p num="57">Depending on the heterocyclic core used, the hydrogen bond-accepting group may be distanced from the heterocyclic core by a methylene group on one or both sides of the heterocyclic core to provide the distance and/or orientation required to interact with the flap IIe50 and IIe50' residues.</p>
    <p num="58">
      Preferably, the atoms of the backbone chain are carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, oxygen, silicon and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Examples of Y are, without limitation, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched alkyl, alkylamine, alkoxy, alkoxyamine, thioalkyl, thioalkoxy, thioalkoxyamine, thioalkylamine, phosphidoalkyl, phosphidoalkoxy, phosphidoalkoxyamine and phosphidoalkylamine groups.
      <br/>
      Y may also include functional groups to provide additional interaction between the inhibitor and the substrate-binding site.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      It is well understood by those skilled in the art that effective HIV protease inhibitors have R groups that interact similarly with the sub-sites of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      For example, Wlodawer et al. (ibid, at pp. 558-561) evaluated the structural similarities of 12 different HIV protease inhibitors, when bound in the protease active site in an extended conformation.
      <br/>
      They reported that the functional elements of each of the inhibitors were substantially aligned overall when the structures were superimposed with one another.
      <br/>
      This observation is evidence that the side chains (i.e., R groups) of each of the inhibitors interact similarly, and thereby conform with, the sub-sites in the HIV protease.
      <br/>
      Although one or two non-conforming R groups are unlikely to fully negate an inhibitor's performance, they could diminish an inhibitor's effectiveness.
      <br/>
      Therefore, most preferably, each of the R groups has the appropriate size, architecture and hydrophilic/hydrophobic character to conform with each of the sub-sites, while the Y moieties provide an appropriate extension for properly presenting the R groups to their respective sub-sites.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Examples of suitable R1, R1', R2 and R2' groups are, without limitation, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched, C1 -C6 alkanes, C1 -C6 alkenes and C1 -C6 alkynes; substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched C3 -C9 cycloalkanes and C3 -C9 cycloalkenes; and substituted or unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon and heterocyclic rings.

      R1, R1', R2 and R2' may be the same or different.
      <br/>
      R1, R1', R2 and R2' may also contain one or more amino acids.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferred that the R1, R1', R2 and R2' groups do not contain amino acids because of the associated bioavailability problems.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Preferably, R1 and R1' are phenyl, benzyl, t-butyl, i-butyl, or i-propyl groups.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="62">Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the interaction of an HIV protease inhibitor, of the general formula (II) of the present invention, with the aspartic acid residues of the active site, the S1, S1 ', S2 and S2 ' sub-sites, and the flap IIe50 and IIe50' residues is as shown in Scheme 4, wherein the heterocycle is an imidazole ring, X is a carbonyl group, n is 0, Y is --NH--CH2 --COO--, R1 and R1' are benzyl groups and R2 and R2' are t-butyl groups.  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="63">
      Scheme 4 illustrates interaction between the imidazole ring and the carboxyl groups of the aspartic acid residues, as described in Scheme 2.
      <br/>
      However, Scheme 4 does not illustrate any other contacts between the inhibitor and the substrate-binding site.
      <br/>
      The benzyl groups occupy the S1 and S1 ' sub-sites and the t-butyl groups occupy the S2 and S2 ' sub-sites.
      <br/>
      The flap IIe50 and IIe50' residues are bound to the carbonyl groups adjacent the heterocyclic core through a water molecule.

    <p num="65">wherein Het, Y, X, R1, R1', R2 and R2' are defined as above in general formula II.</p>
    <p num="66">Selection of Z groups may be accomplished by applying structure-based drug design and/or analog-based drug design principles known to those skilled in the art.</p>
    <p num="67">The use of structure-based design in HIV protease inhibitor modeling is discussed in Clare, M. Perspectives in Drug Discovery and Design 1:49-68; 1993.</p>
    <p num="68">
      Structure-based drug design techniques include: X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and molecular modeling.
      <br/>
      The most widely used technique is X-ray crystallography.
      <br/>
      This method provides a 3-dimensional representation of the interaction between the protease and a bound inhibitor.
      <br/>
      Detailed information regarding the bound conformation of the inhibitor and of the interactions between enzyme and inhibitor can be obtained from this technique.
      <br/>
      It is, therefore, possible to determine whether addition of another functional group is required, if it is desirable to enhance binding in the enzyme/inhibitor complex, or whether the modification of an existing R group would enhance the binding.
    </p>
    <p num="69">In this manner, the design, synthesis, and biological assessment of protease inhibitors can be used iteratively with X-ray crystallography results to optimize inhibitor interactions.</p>
    <p num="70">NMR spectroscopy has been used in an analogous manner although this technique can be more difficult to use and the results may be more difficult to interpret.</p>
    <p num="71">
      Molecular modeling can be employed in multiple ways to the process of R group optimization.
      <br/>
      The characteristics (shape, electronic, and hydrophobic character) of the active-site and surrounding sub-sites can be determined by various modeling methods.
      <br/>
      Then, comparison of a bound inhibitor with these "ideal" characteristics may identify beneficial changes to an inhibitor to improve complementarity between inhibitor and enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="72">Examples of software used by companies and researchers involved in drug design are SYBYL (Tripos, St. Louis, Mo.), CERIUS 2 (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, Calif.), DISCOVER (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, Calif.), SPARTAN and DOCK (UCSF, CA).</p>
    <p num="73">
      In analog-based drug design, a 3-dimensional structure of the enzyme is not known empirically although a model of the enzyme may be proposed.
      <br/>
      For these cases, the biological activity of the inhibitors directs the discovery and optimization process.
      <br/>
      Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) can be determined for a variety of functional group changes to the original inhibitor(s).
      <br/>
      The methodology for converting information from QSAR studies to an optimized inhibitor has been extensively utilized in drug design.
      <br/>
      Modeling may also play an important role in analyzing the active inhibitors to find which characteristics (shape, electronic, and hydrophobic character) may be similar when bound to the enzyme.
      <br/>
      These studies are called 3D-QSAR techniques and application of this technique for HIV protease inhibitors is well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Such techniques can be similarly employed to optimize the selection of R groups for inhibitors of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Optimization of these interactions can then proceed beginning with election of a heterocyclic core and working away from the active site towards he sub-sites sequentially.
      <br/>
      Thus, the heterocycles can be first altered to determine the best choice for interacting with the active site aspartic acid residues.
      <br/>
      Concurrent with these design experiments will be a decision of whether a hydrogen bond-accepting group will be necessary to orient the conserved water for flap binding.
      <br/>
      Optimized binding is likely to require this interaction and so it is likely that a hydrogen bond-accepting group will be included in the final compound.
      <br/>
      In this case it is then necessary to consider both the distance and geometry of the hydrogen bond-accepting group while choosing the heterocyclic ring.
      <br/>
      For example, if two carbonyl groups are used to bind the flap IIe50 and IIe50' residues to the inhibitor, each heterocycle will offer slightly different distances between the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups as well as a different torsion angle (measured by using the oxygen and carbon atoms of the two carbonyl groups) to define the relative orientation of the two carbonyl groups to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      In this manner it may be possible to make changes to the two Z groups off the heterocyclic core until an optimized compound is obtained and then simply remove one of the two Z groups to yield an monosubstituted heterocyclic inhibitor.
      <br/>
      This may compromise the overall properties of the inhibitor.
      <br/>
      However, the compound may still exhibit modest inhibitory potency and perhaps even improved pharmacokinetic properties due to the smaller size.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The protease inhibitors of the present invention are also suitable to inhibition of renin, pepsin and cathepsin D. However, since the substrate-binding sites of renin, pepsin and cathepsin 0 differ from that of HIV protease, Z group selection may require alteration in the functional groups and spacing thereof to provide a stabilized enzyme/inhibitor complex.
      <br/>
      For example, while HIV protease has a pair of  BETA -hairpin flaps that cover the active site, pepsin has only one such flap.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      The protease inhibitors of the present invention are useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases and conditions caused or assisted by the action of aspartic proteases.
      <br/>
      In particular, the inhibitors of the present invention are useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of HIV.
      <br/>
      However, the protease inhibitors of the present invention are also useful for inhibiting cathepsin D which is a lysosomal enzyme that degrades proteins intracellularly, renin which catalyzes removal of the decapeptide angiotensin I which plays an major role in the control of blood pressure, and pepsin which is a gastric enzyme involved in digestion.
