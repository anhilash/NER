      The invention relates to adhesive compositions having a modified polyethylene; an unmodified polyethylene of a certain density and a styrene-based elastomer.
      <br/>
      The styrene-based elastomer is present in a weight percentage of 10 to 45 wt. percent relative to the total weight of the elastomer plus the modified and unmodified polyethylenes.
      <br/>
      The adhesive composition is particularly useful in multilayer composite structures having polypropylene as one substrate and having bonded thereto a polyethylene or a layer which is made from an ethylene copolymer such as an ethylene/acid copolymer or an ethylene acid ionomer.
      <br/>
      In addition, the adhesive composition is particularly useful in multilayer structures having five layers wherein a single adhesive composition is needed as layer two and four and the other structural layers are, for example, polyethylene/ nylon/polypropylene or similar structures which would heretofore require two different polyolefin based adhesives.

    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This invention relates to adhesive compositions, particularly co-extrudable adhesives, suitable for complex composite structures, such as those having multiple barrier and structural layers which are typically incompatible with each other.
      <br/>
      The adhesive compositions are blends of acid-grafted polyethylene and unmodified polyethylene and styrene butadiene rubber.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">Co-extrudable adhesives based on blends of various polyethylenes which also contain an acid-grafted polyolefin to aid in adhesion to polar layers are well known.</p>
    <p num="6">U.S. Pat. No. 3,868,433 discloses polyolefins generally, graft-modified with acids, and which may also contain elastomers, for use as hot-melt adhesives.</p>
    <p num="7">U.S. Pat. No. 4,684,576 discloses adhesive blends based on acid-grafted high density polyethylene, and linear low density polyethylene of density 0.88 to 0.935.</p>
    <p num="8">U.S. Pat. No. 4,058,647 discloses blends of modified and unmodified polyolefins with a rubber component having 40-150 of Mooney viscosity 50 ML 1+4 at 100 (degree)  C. There is no teaching of elastomeric components having immeasurable Mooney viscosities under these conditions for blending with the polyolefins nor is there a specific example which shows or describes the use of a styrene based elastomer.</p>
    <p num="9">
      U. S. Pat. 4,198,327 discloses compositions of graft modified crystalline polyolefins (optionally mixed with ungrafted crystalline polyolefins) and a hydrocarbon elastomer as having improved adhesion to polar solid materials.
      <br/>
      While styrene butadiene rubber is generically disclosed-there is no specific teaching in the examples of the use of a styrene based elastomer.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      EPO 412 503 A2 discloses a multitude of adhesive resin compositions and multilayer structures containing the adhesives.
      <br/>
      An adhesive composition of a second embodiment as disclosed therein relates to a composition having 100 parts by weight of a soft polymer and 1 to 30 parts by weight of partially or wholly grafted modified polyethylene in which a grafting amount of an unsaturated carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof is 0.05 to 15% by weight, the soft polymer comprising (a) 20 to 100% by weight of a styrene elastomer and (b) 80 to 0% by weight of an ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer having an ethylene content of 45 to 95 mole %. Example 5 in this publication describes the use of 100 parts by weight ("pbw") of a stryene based elastomer and 10 pbw of maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene wherein this adhesive is layered between polycarbonate/EVOH/PP.
      <br/>
      Example 6 of this publication describes the use of 75 pbw of a styrene elastomer; 25 pbw of an ethylene/propylene random copolymer and 10 pbw of a maleic anhydride grafted PE and a multilayer structure similar to above or comprising PET/EVOH/PP with the adhesive between each internal layer-i.e., where the / is.
      <br/>
      This patent clearly specifically shows that a large percentage of styrene elastomer is necessary in the adhesive composition in spite of generic teachings which may suggest otherwise.
      <br/>
      In addition, the density of the unmodified ethylene-alpha olefin utilized therein in the blend with the styrene elastomer to form the soft polymer composition must be 0.850 to 0.900 g/cm. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,482 and 5,250,349.
    </p>
    <p num="11">U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,792 discloses adhesive compositions containing styrene-butadiene elastomers wherein the composition requires a tackifier as a key excipient.</p>

      U.S. Pat. 5,643,999 discloses mixtures of polyethylenes and certain elastomers wherein the blend may be modified or unmodified and wherein the adhesives are used to bond ionomer structural layers to barrier layers.
      <br/>
      This patent requires the use of at least two different polyethylenes with two distinct (non-overlapping) density ranges.
      <br/>
      No specific examples describe the use of a styrene based elastomer even though they (among other hydrocarbon elastomers with certain heats of fusion) are generically disclosed as comprising 5-30% of the composition.
      <br/>
      The present invention, on the other hand, requires that the styrene based elastomer is unmodified.
      <br/>
      In addition, the '999 patent teaches that no polyethylenes of density greater than 0.935 can be present in the composition.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,298,712 discloses adhesive blends having elastomers, grafted high density polyethylene and polyethylene resin(s).
      <br/>
      The grafting reagent selected to graft to the high density polyethylene is selected from unsaturated fused ring carboxylic acid anhydrides.
      <br/>
      This compounds must contain one or more carbocyclic or other ring moieties not including the anhydride ring.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      It is also known that polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, are widely used as packaging materials because of their good mechanical strength, water resistance and organoleptic properties.
      <br/>
      Because of their high permeability to gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, etc., such polyolefins are frequently combined with polar polymers with excellent barrier properties, such as ethylene vinyl alcohol polymers and polyamides, to form a composite structure with desirable properties.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Such composite structures are held together by acid modified extrudable adhesives.
      <br/>
      It is a relatively simple matter to select such adhesives when the composite structure contains very similar structural layers.
      <br/>
      A structure comprising of polypropylene and EVOH or polypropylene and nylon can easily be bound together with a acid modified polypropylene adhesive.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a structure of polyethylene and EVOH can be bonded together with an acid-modified polyethylene adhesive.
      <br/>
      It becomes a more complicated matter when the composite structure contains different structural layers.
      <br/>
      For example, with a composite film of polyethylene/nylon/polypropylene, one could use an acid-modified polyethylene adhesive to bond the polyethylene layer to the nylon layer and an acid-modified polypropylene adhesive to bond the polypropylene layer to the nylon layer.
      <br/>
      This could be highly inconvenient to the converter since it would necessitate the use of two separate adhesive extruders rather than a single adhesive extruder.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the fabricator could use an acid modified ethylene vinyl acetate or ethylene methyl acrylate adhesive to bond both polypropylene and polyethylene layers to the nylon layers.
      <br/>
      However, such adhesives are well known to impart odor and taste to packaged foods; thus, the excellent organoleptic properties of the composite structure are compromised.
    </p>
    <p num="16">In another example, a composite structure of polypropylene, EVOH and ethylene ionomer cannot be bound well together by a single acid modified polyethylene or polypropylene adhesive and the converter, again, must resort to either using both adhesives or to an acid modified ethylene vinyl acetate or ethylene methyl acrylate adhesive.</p>
    <p num="17">
      It is an object of this invention, therefore, to provide a polyolefin based adhesive composition that can be used to bond polypropylene as part of at least a three-layer multilayer structure to ethylene polymers, such as polyethylene, ethylene acid copolymers and ethylene acid ionomers without requiring two different adhesives while also able to bond similar substrates through an intervening barrier layer such as polypropylene/nylon/polypropylene.
      <br/>
      In addition, the compositions of the invention do not require a separate tackifier as an essential ingredient and in some embodiments, as compositions and in certain multilayer structures having said compositions, ethylene-alpha olefins having a density of less than or equal to 0.900 g/cm3 are excluded.
      <br/>
      The inventors have found that medium to high density unmodified polymers coupled with a combination of modified polymers and styrene based elastomers in certain relative weight percentages provides significant gains in adhesion properties.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, the inventors have also found that the particular choice of elastomer in the adhesive blend has a significant effect on adhesive properties.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="23">
      The unmodified polyethylene polymer referred to in the present invention denotes ethylene homopolymers and ethylene copolymers of alpha-olefins, such as but not limited to 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene.
      <br/>
      These are commonly known as high density polyethylene (HDPE),low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and, in some multilayer structures recited herein, very low density polyethylene (VLDPE) and ultra low density polyethylene (ULDPE).
      <br/>
      The polyethylenes of the invention may be utilized in the adhesive composition described herein or may be utilized as a structural layer component.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The density distinguishing abbreviations HDPE, LLDPE, VLDPE and ULDPE are used for `linear` as distinct from highly branched (short and long chain) LDPE made by free-radical polymerization.
      <br/>
      Originally, before the advent of metallocene catalysts, the terms referred to resins made using Ziegler-Natta type catalysis.
      <br/>
      However, the terms are now often also used for resins made by metallocene catalysis as well.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In this disclosure where it is necessary to make the distinction, resins made by Ziegler-Natta type catalysis will be referred to as conventional-HDPE, conventional-LLDPE, conventional-VLDPE and conventional-ULDPE.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, it is understood that resins referred to as HPDE, LLDPE, VLDPE and ULDPE include resins manufactured by both Ziegler-Natta or metallocene catalysis.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Density ranges differ in the literature.
      <br/>
      Generally, the density ranges are: HDPE greater than 0.935 g/cc, LLDPE from greater than 0.91 to 0.935 g/cc and VLDPE and ULDPE from 0.85 to 0.91 g/cc. VLDPE is sometimes included as a subset in the category LLDPE, the density range for the latter going down to 0.85. To avoid confusion, resins at or below 0.91 g/cc will always be referred to as VLDPE.
      <br/>
      LDPE in this disclosure is free radical polymerized polyethylene having a density from 0.91 to 0.935 g/cc.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The LLDPE, VLDPE and ULDPE disclosed herein are produced by copolymerizing ethylene with alpha-olefin selected from the group consisting of butene-1, pentene-1, hexene-1, 4-methyl pentene-1, heptene-1, octene-1, etc.
      <br/>
      The density will depend on a large part on the amount and type of alpha-olefins used as the comonomer.
      <br/>
      Thus, HDPE may also contain small amounts of alpha-olefin as the comonomer.
      <br/>
      In the adhesive formulation recited herein as a formulation, the density of any ethylene-alpha olefin utilized as an unmodified polyethylene have a range of 0.86 to 0.97 g/cc or from 0.91 to 0.97 g/cc. As indicated above, when the invention comprises a multilayer structure having a polypropylene layer, an adhesive layer and an ethylene acid or ionomer layer or other multilayer structure as recited herein, the density of any ethylene-alpha polyolefin included therein as the unmodified polyethylene may range from 0.86-0.97 g/cc provided the other formulation limitations are met for the adhesive composition.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Metallocene polyethylenes are more uniform in various composition-related aspects than Ziegler-Natta polyethylenes.
      <br/>
      The molecular weight distribution is narrow compared with that of conventional-HDPE, conventional-LLDPE and conventional-VLDPE.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the alpha-olefin comonomer is introduced in a far more uniform way, both along any given chain and from chain to chain, so that the short-chain branching distribution is narrow.
      <br/>
      In certain metallocene polyethylenes, it has been found possible to have a small amount of long-chain branching which, because of its uniform positioning along the polymer chains and from chain to chain, allows the molecular weight distribution to be narrow, yet changes the melt rheological behavior, typically making their flow more non-Newtonian over a large range of shear.
      <br/>
      Metallocene resins can thus be considered as being divided into two groups.
      <br/>
      The first group are those metallocene resins which contain either no or very low (as distinct from a small amount of) long-chain branching.
      <br/>
      The second group are those which are believed to contain a small amount of long-chain branching.
      <br/>
      This latter group corresponds roughly, but not precisely, to those using the same terminology as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,278,272. These groups can be distinguished from each other by two readily measurable parameters, the melt flow ratio and the Mw/Mn ratio.
      <br/>
      The first group are those which have a I-10/I-2 ratio of less than 6.53 together with an Mw/Mn of greater than (I-10/I-2)-4.63. The second group are those which have an I-10/I-2 ratio of equal or greater than 6.53 together with an Mw/Mn of equal or less than (I-10/I-2)-4.63. The invention, therefore, also relates to those adhesive compositions and multilayer structures having modified and unmodified metallocene polyethylenes or combinations of metallocene resins and non-metallocene resins (modified or unmodified).
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The conventional polyethylenes can be prepared by well-known Ziegler-Natta methods (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,645,992), catalysis in solution, slurry, gas phase or on a support.
      <br/>
      Metallocene resins may be made using conditions well known in the prior art for continuous polymerization, Ziegler-Natta or Kaminsky-Sinn type polymerization reactions.
      <br/>
      Suspension, solution, slurry, gas phase or other process conditions may be employed, if desired.
      <br/>
      A support may be employed, but preferably the catalysts are used in a homogeneous manner.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      LDPE is produced by polymerizing ethylene at high pressures and high temperatures and using a free radical initiator, such as a peroxide.
      <br/>
      The polymer contains substantial amounts of long chain branching, where the branched chains, consisting of ethylene units of various lengths, are pendant of the main polymer chains or of other branched chains.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The unmodified polyethylene may be blends of one or more of the following groups: conventional polyethylenes, LDPE and metallocene polyethylenes and having the density range designations indicated above.</p>
    <p num="32">
      The modified polyethylene is a polyethylene resin, such as described for the unmodified polyethylenes above, which has been further modified with unsaturated carboxylic acids or its derivatives.
      <br/>
      The grafting monomer is selected from the group consisting of ethylenically unsaturated mono-, di- or polycarboxylic acids and ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid anhydrides, including derivatives of such acids or anhydrides.
      <br/>
      Acid grafting agents which are suitable include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, nadic acid, itaconic acid, crotonic acid, itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride and dimethyl maleic anhydride.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable derivatives include salts, amides, imides and esters of such acids or anhydrides.
      <br/>
      Among the acids or anhydrides, which are particularly useful, are maleic acid or maleic anhydride.
      <br/>
      The method of grafting onto the polyethylenes can be any of the processes well known in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, grafting can be carried out in the melt without a solvent, as disclosed in European Patent Application 0,266,994, or in solution or dispersion or in a fluidized bed.
      <br/>
      Melt grafting can be done in a heated extruder, a Brabender.RTM. or a Banbury.RTM. mixer or other internal mixers or kneading machines, roll mills and the like.
      <br/>
      The grafting may be carried out in the presence or absence of a radical initiator, such as a suitable organic peroxide, organic perester or organic hydroperoxide.
      <br/>
      The grafted polymers are recovered by any method which separates or utilizes the graft polymer that is formed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the graft polymer can be recovered in the form of precipitated fluff, pellets, powders and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The art of grafting uniformly is well known, and the acid grafted resin should be as uniformly grafted as possible.
      <br/>
      The acid or anhydride groups generally comprise 0.005 to about 5 weight percent, preferably 0.01 to 3 weight percent, most preferably 0.05 to 3 weight percent of the modified polyethylene resin.
    </p>
    <p num="34">The term "unmodified" means that the polyethylene or the styrene-based elastomer does not have a grafting reagent such as those discussed above grafted to the base polymeric backbone.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The unmodified and modified polyethylene collectively comprise 55 to 85 percent by weight of the adhesive composition, preferably 60 to 80 percent by weight.
      <br/>
      The relative weight percentage ratios of unmodified to modified polyethylene ranges from 0 to 99 to 100 to 1%.
      <br/>
      It is understood that the graft modified polyethylene can but does not have to be the same resin as the unmodified polyethylene.
      <br/>
      It is further understood that the acid modified polyethylene itself may consist of blends of different polyethylene resins grafted together during the graft modification process or blends of different graft modified polyethylenes.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The styrene-based elastomer comprises 15 to 45 percent by weight of the adhesive composition.
      <br/>
      The styrene elastomer is a monovinyl aromatic hydrocarbon/olefin block copolymer elastomer having a linear or branched block structure.
      <br/>
      Styrene and alpha-methyl styrene are preferably used as monovinyl aromatic hydrocarbons with styrene being especially preferred.
      <br/>
      The olefin may be selected from conjugated di-olefins, such as butadiene and isoprene, and alpha-olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and 1-butene.
      <br/>
      The polymer block formed by polymerization of a conjugated di-olefin may be fully or partially hydrogenated.
      <br/>
      The amount of monovinyl aromatic hydrocarbon polymer blocks is generally 5 to 55 weight percent of the elastomer.
      <br/>
      The preferred polymer blocks have a monovinyl aromatic hydrocarbon selected from styrene with a relative weight percentage in the elastomer of 10 to 50 percent.
      <br/>
      The styrene-based elastomers have a melt index range, as measured by ASTM D1238 condition G, of 0.001 to 100. The styrene based elastomers utilized in the composition of the claimed invention have Mooney viscosities which are immeasurable under the conditions specified in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,058,647. The conditions specified therein were conducted under ML 1+4 at 100 (degree)  C. and were measurable and provided Mooney viscosities in the range of 40-150.
      <br/>
      Under the identical testing conditions at 100 (degree)  C., the styrene based elastomers utilized herein were immeasurable.
      <br/>
      This result clearly shows that the styrene based elastomers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,058,647 are not similar to those utilized in the present invention.
      <br/>
      Some of the elastomers recited herein as part of the claimed composition and multilayer structures have measurable Mooney viscosities at higher temperatures than 100 (degree)  C.-e.g., at greater than 110 (degree)  C. (i.e., 121 (degree)  C.) or greater than 140 (degree)  C. (i.e., 150 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      Without being bound hereto, it is thought that styrene based elastomers having a Mooney viscosity range of 2 to 200 at ML 1+4 150 (degree)  C. are suitable in the claimed compositions and multilayer structures.
      <br/>
      It is believed that this class of elastomers in combination with the other components of the adhesive composition provides a unique and surprising balance of properties that enhances the adhesion properties to, for example, polypropylene based multilayer structures.
      <br/>
      These uncured elastomers also have a heat of fusion based upon Differential Scanning Calorimetry DSC of below 25 J/gm.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      These styrene-based elastomers are commercially available under the trade names KRAYTON.RTM. T, D and 0 from Shell, BUNAT BL.RTM. from Bayer and STERON.RTM. from Firestone Corp.
      <br/>
      KRAYTON.RTM. G1652 provided a Mooney viscosity of about 100 at ML 1+4 at 150 (degree)  C. (immeasurable at 100 (degree)  C. or at 121 (degree)  C. and STEREON.RTM. 840A had a Mooney viscosity of 47 at ML 1+4 121 (degree)  C. This data supports the recitation of Moonies of 2 to 200 at ML 1+4 150 (degree)  C.

      <br/>
      Polyamides, EVOH and ethylene copolymers such as ethylene/methacrylic acid or ethylene/acrylic acid or ionomers thereof represent relatively polar polymers relative to polyethylene or polypropylene or ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymers.

      The adhesive compositions are prepared by dry blending the ingredients together in a polyethylene bag and subsequently melt blending in a 30 mm Werner Pfleiderer twin screw extruder or similar piece of equipment.

      The melt temperature is typically 225 to 250 (degree)  C. Of course, other processing conditions may be used to form the adhesive compositions and multilayer structures having said adhesive compositions depending upon the available processing equipment, quantities needed and the particular excipients etc.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The adhesive compositions may be coextruded between a layer of, for example, Sclair.RTM. 19A, a conventional HDPE of MI 0.75 g/10 minutes and a layer of Fina.RTM. 3365, a polypropylene homopolymer of MFI 3 g/10 minutes.
      <br/>
      The adhesives are then melted at about 200 (degree)  C. in a 25 mm single screw extruder operating at about 15 rpm.

      All three melt streams are fed through a Brampton coextrusion blown film die so as to form a three-layer film with the ionomer layer at about 38 microns, the PP at about 50 microns each and the tie layer at about 14 microns.

    <p num="59">In the following examples, the test methods listed and described below were utilized:</p>
    <p num="60">
      Peel strength was measured using ASTM D1876-72.
      <br/>
      Prior to evaluating bond strengths of the laminates, the laminates were conditioned for at least 24 hours at 25 (degree)  C. at 50% relative humidity.
      <br/>
      Peel strength was evaluated according to the above ASTM method by separating the film at the weakest interface, and testing on an Instron tester in the (T) peel configuration, at 30 cm/min (12 inches/minute) separation rate.
      <br/>
      The average value of at least three, more typically 5, specimens was recorded as the peel strength of the sample.
      <br/>
      The examples below relative to the comparative examples show relative good or inadequate peel strengths.

    <p num="61">
      Melt index is measured according to ASTM D1238 (190 (degree)  C./2.16kg) unless otherwise noted.
      <br/>
      For the styrene elastomers, the melt index is measured according to ASTM D1238 (200 (degree)  C./5.0 kg), sometimes known as condition G. For the metallocene ethylene polymers, the melt flow ratio I- 10/I-2 and molecular weight distribution were measured as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,278,272.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Mooney viscosities are measured according to ASTM D 1646 which is the standard viscosity test for styrene rubbers.
      <br/>
      Under low temperature conditions (100 (degree)  C. or less) as specified in U.S. Pat. No. 4,058,647, the elastomers utilized in the present invention could not be measured.
      <br/>
      In order to begin to obtain measurable Moonies for the styrene based elastomers utilized herein, the temperature had to be raised to greater than 110 (degree)  C. as stated above.
      <br/>
      It is believed that the elastomers utilized in the present invention have higher molecular mass than those materials described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,058,647. Thus, the present invention is directed to those adhesive compositions and multilayer structures having styrene based elastomers with high-molecular mass which means those elastomers which have immeasurable Moonies at ML 1+4 100 (degree)  C. or less.

      Comparative example C1, differing only from Example 10 in the elastomer type, clearly does not possess as high a peel strength as Example 10, which contains the elastomer described by the invention.
      <br/>
      Comparative examples C2, C3 and C4 show that in utilizing VLDPE in place of an elastomer, such as EPDM in C1, the peel performance of the adhesives to polypropylene does not improve to the same degree as for Examples 1 through 10.
      <br/>
      Example 7 is identical to Example 10, except that it has a different unmodified PE, and shows excellent peel performance.
      <br/>
      Examples 1 and 2 show that high peel strength is obtained compared to C1, when different levels of the styrene elastomer is used.

      The adhesive compositions in Table 3 were made in a similar manner as those in Table 2.

      They were coextruded between a layer of Fina.RTM. 3365, a propylene homopolymer of MFI 3 g/10 minutes, and a layer of Surlyn.RTM. 1601. Surlyn.RTM. 1601 is an ethylene ionomer from DuPont with a melt index of 1.7. The adhesives were melted at 210 (degree)  C. in a 25 mm single screw extruder operating at about 13 rpm.
      <br/>
      The ionomer was melted at 198 (degree)  C. in a 25 mm single screw extruder operating at 43 rpm.

      The PP was melted at 218 (degree)  C. in a 25 mm single screw extruder operating at 89 rpm.
      <br/>
      All three melt streams were fed through a Brampton coextrusion blown film die so as to form a three-layer film with the ionomer layer at 38 microns, the PP at 50 microns each and the tie layer at 14 microns.
      <br/>
      The die temperature was 220 (degree)  C. The blow up ratio of the blown film, defined as the lay flat width of the film bubble divided by the diameter of the die opening, was 3.25. The film was run at about 3.8 meters/minute through the take-up rolls.

      Comparative Examples 5, 6 and 7 contain varying amounts of an EPDM elastomer, yet provide poor peel strength values compared to Examples 11 through 30, which contain varying amounts of acid modified graft polymer and varying levels of the styrene-based elastomer of this invention.
      <br/>
      Comparative Examples 8 and 9 show that in utilizing VLDPE in place of an elastomer such as EPDM in C1, the peel performance of the adhesives is not improved to the same degree as Examples 11 and 16, the closest examples to these two comparative examples.
      <br/>
      In fact, as can be seen from comparative Example C10, which contains predominantly VLDPE, peel strengths are inferior to a less expensive adhesive composition containing predominantly LLDPE, such as Examples 11, 22 or 23.
