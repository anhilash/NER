    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a digital-to-analog converter, and more particularly, to a non-linear digital-to-analog converter which realizes non-linear output with overlapped resistor string.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Generally, industrial systems and controllers have trends to digitalization with the spread of CPUs having fast speed in an analog circuit at suitable cost.
      <br/>
      Most of industrial systems and controllers share digital mode with analog mode.
      <br/>
      In this respect, for signal transmission between digital mode and analog mode, an analog-to-digital converter or a digital-to-analog converter is required.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      An analog-to-digital converter is used in the field of instrumentation and control.
      <br/>
      With the development of microcomputers, parts processed by analog mode have been processed by converting an analog signal to a digital signal using the analog-to-digital converter.
      <br/>
      For this reason, reliability and efficiency of applied products have improved.
    </p>
    <p num="6">A background art digital-to-analog converter will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="7">FIGS. 1a and 1b are schematic diagrams illustrating a background art digital-to-analog converter.</p>
    <p num="8">As shown in FIG. 1a, the background art digital-to-analog converter includes a primary resistor string 1, most significant bit (MSB) switching block 2, least significant bit (LSB) switching block 3, a secondary resistor string 4, and LSB output switching portion 5.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Two voltages formed in succession between V2 and V1 are applied between M1.about.M7 of the primary resistor string 1 using the MSB switching block 2 and the LSB switching block 3.
      <br/>
      One voltage is output through the LSB output switching portion 5.
    </p>
    <p num="10">As shown in FIG. 1b, the background art digital-to-analog converter includes a primary resistor string 6 consisting of Ra1.about.Ra2N/2 -1, a first switching block 7 consisting of Sa1-Sa2N/2 1, a secondary resistor string 8 consisting of Rb1.about.Rb2N/2 -1, a second switching block 9 consisting of Sb1.about.Sb2N/2 -1, a cubic resistor string 10 consisting of Rc1.about.Rc2N/2 -1, and a third switching block 11 consisting of Sc1.about.Sc2N/2 -1.</p>
    <p num="11">In the aforementioned digital-to-analog converter, resistor ratio of Ra, Rb and Rc is 2N/2 :2N/2 :1 and a total of resistor string selected by the MSB plus resistor string selected by the LSB is 2the number of MSB *2N/2 of Rc.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In other words, among 6 bits, when high 3 bits are the MSB and low 3 bits are the LSB, Ra is 2*23 times (8-101(2) -1) of Rc in case of 101010(2).
      <br/>
      At this time, Rb is 5*23 times (101(2)).
      <br/>
      Since Rc is always 23, total resistor value is 8*23 times (23 *23).
    </p>
    <p num="13">If the value of 010(2) is selected by Sc of the third switching block 11, it is possible to wholly select the value of 101010(2).</p>
    <p num="14">The aforementioned background art digital-to-analog converter has several problems.</p>
    <p num="15">
      First, since the secondary resistor string is always fixed at a uniform value, it can be applied to the digital-to-analog converter which outputs linear value.
      <br/>
      However, it cannot be used in apparatuses which require non-linear value.
      <br/>
      In addition, the resistor value may be greater than a desired resistor value due to on-resistor constituting each switching block.
      <br/>
      This causes incorrect conversion value.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a non-linear digital-to-analog converter that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
    <p num="17">An object of the present invention is to provide a non-linear digital-to-analog converter which realizes non-linear output with overlapped resistor string.</p>
