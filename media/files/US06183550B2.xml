    <p num="2">This invention relates to aqueous size dispersions, to methods for making sized paper utilizing the dispersions, and to paper prepared by the methods.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Cellulose-reactive and cellulose non-reactive sizes are used widely for sizing paper during its manufacture.
      <br/>
      Because these sizes are most frequently water-insoluble, they are generally used in the form of aqueous dispersions so that they can be readily handled in the aqueous paper making environment.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Surfactants, i.e., materials typically containing both oil soluble hydrocarbon chains and water soluble polar groups, are generally not used as dispersants for paper size dispersions because they tend to exhibit an anti-sizing effect, i.e. they reduce water resistance.
      <br/>
      Conventional surfactants generally have one hydrophilic group and one hydrophobic group.
      <br/>
      Recently a class of surfactants having at least two hydrophobic groups and at least two hydrophilic groups has been introduced.
      <br/>
      These have been found to be unexpectedly effective when compared to conventional surfactants (Rosen, M. J., Chemtech, March, 1993, pp. 30-33; and Menger, F. M. &amp; Littau, C. A., J. Am Chem. Soc., 1993, 115, pp. 10083-10090).
      <br/>
      These have become known in the literature as "gemini surfactants".

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">It has now been found that gemini surfactants, and certain other surfactants, are especially effective for preparing dispersions of paper sizing compounds, even when used at very low levels, providing size dispersions that produce paper with unexpectedly high sizing properties.</p>

      In a yet another embodiment the invention relates to a process for preparing sized paper comprising: a) providing an aqueous paper making pulp suspension; b) sheeting and at least partially drying the aqueous pulp suspension to obtain paper; c) applying to the surface of the paper an aqueous dispersion comprising at least one paper sizing compound and a water-soluble dispersant containing at least two hydrophilic groups and at least one hydrophobic group; and d) drying to obtain sized paper.
      <br/>
      It also relates to a process for preparing sized paper comprising: a) providing an aqueous paper making pulp suspension; b) adding to the aqueous pulp solution an aqueous dispersion comprising at least one paper sizing compound and a water-soluble dispersant containing at least two hydrophilic groups and at least one hydrophobic group; and c) sheeting and drying the aqueous pulp suspension of step (b) to obtain sized paper.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The compositions of the invention are aqueous dispersions comprising at least one paper sizing compound and a water-soluble dispersant that is a surfactant containing at least two hydrophilic groups and at least one hydrophobic group.
      <br/>
      The surfactants of the invention are water soluble and form micelles when dissolved in water above the critical micelle concentration.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Hydrophilic groups are the groups in the surfactant that promote water solubility.
      <br/>
      Hydrophobic groups are those that distort the structure of the water in which the surfactant is dissolved, and cause micelle formation and adsorption of the surfactant at the interfaces of the system.
      <br/>
      Hydrophobic groups are often alkyl or perfluoroalkyl chains.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Paper Sizing Compounds</p>

      They may also be used in surface sizing, where they are applied to the surface of the paper from a size press after the sheet is formed and at least partially dried.

      The size press can be any type of coating or spraying equipment, but most commonly is a puddle, gate roller or metered blade type of size press.

    <p num="71">
      The Hercules Size Test, an art-recognized test for measuring sizing performance, is described in Pulp and Paper Chemistry and Chemical Technology, J. P. Casey, Ed., Vol. 3, p. 1553-1554 (1981) and in TAPPI Standard T530.
      <br/>
      The Hercules Size Test determines the degree of water sizing obtained in paper by measuring the change in reflectance of the paper's surface as an aqueous solution of dye penetrates from the opposite surface side.
      <br/>
      The aqueous dye solution, e.g., naphthol green dye in 1% formic acid, is contained in a ring on the top surface of the paper, and the change in reflectance is measured photoelectrically from the bottom surface.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Test duration is limited by choosing a convenient end point, e.g., a reduction in reflected light of 20%, corresponding to 80% reflectance.
      <br/>
      A timer measures the time (in seconds) for the end point of the test to be reached.
      <br/>
      Longer times correlate with increased sizing performance, i.e., resistance to water penetration increases.
