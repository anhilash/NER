      Structure and Function of Hemoglobin
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Hemoglobin (Hgb) or Hb is the oxygen-carrying component of blood.
      <br/>
      Hemoglobin circulates through the bloodstream inside small enucleate cells called erythrocytes (red blood cells).
      <br/>
      Hemoglobin is a protein constructed from four associated polypeptide chains, and bearing prosthetic groups known as hemes.
      <br/>
      The erythrocyte helps maintain hemoglobin in its reduced, functional form.
      <br/>
      The here iron atom is susceptible to oxidation, but may be reduced again by one of two enzyme systems within the erythrocyte, the cytochrome b5 and glutathione reduction systems.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The structure of hemoglobin is well known.
      <br/>
      We herewith incorporate by reference the entire text of Bunn and Forget, eds., Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects (W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, Pa.: 1986) and of Fermi and Perutz "Hemoglobin and Myoglobin," in Phillips and Richards, Atlas of Molecular Structures in Biology (Clarendon Press: 1981).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      About 92% of the normal adult human hemolysate is Hgb A (designated alpha2 beta2, because it comprises two alpha and two beta chains).
      <br/>
      Other recognized hemoglobin species are Hgb A2 ( ALPHA 2  DELTA 2), Hgb A1a, Hgb A1b, and Hgb A1c, as well as the rare species Hgb F ( ALPHA 2 gamma), Hgb Gower-1 (Zeta2 epsilon2), Hgb Gower-2 (alpha2 epsilon2), Hgb Portland (Zeta2 gamma2), and Hgb H (beta4) and Hgb Bart (gamma4).
      <br/>
      They are distinguished from Hgb A by a different selection of polypeptide chains.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The primary structure of a polypeptide is defined by its amino acid sequence and by identification of any modifications of the side chains of the individual amino acids.
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequences of both the alpha and beta globin polypeptide chains of "normal" human hemoglobin is given in Table 1.
      <br/>
      Many mutant forms are also known; several mutants are identified in Table 400.
      <br/>
      The wild-type alpha chain consists of 141 amino acids.
      <br/>
      The iron atom of the heme (ferroprotoporphyrin IX) group is bound covalently to the imidazole of His 87 (the "proximal histidine").
      <br/>
      The wild-type beta chain is 146 residues long and heme is bound to it at His 92.
      <br/>
      Apohemoglobin is the heme-free analogue of hemoglobin; it exists predominantly as the  ALPHA  BETA -globin dimer.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Segments of polypeptide chains may be stabilized by folding into one of two common conformations, the alpha helix and the beta pleated sheet.
      <br/>
      In its native state, about 75% of the hemoglobin molecule is alpha-helical.
      <br/>
      Alpha-helical segments are separated by segments wherein the chain is less constrained.
      <br/>
      It is conventional to identify the alpha-helical segments of each chain by letters, e.g., the proximal histidine of the alpha chain is F8 (residue 8 of helix F).
      <br/>

    <p num="62">
      Although free hemoglobin purified from natural sources may be polymerized by chemical crosslinking to increase halflife via increased molecular weight, and to reduce oncotic pressure, all such preparations are heterogeneous.
      <br/>
      Monodispersability can be achieved only by laborious purification.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The present invention provides means of exerting strict control over the degree of polymerization of hemoglobin tetramers.
      <br/>
      The ability to strictly control formation of multimers will greatly facilitate purification and characterization of the final product and will reduce the chance of adverse reaction to minor components.
      <br/>
      It is also believed that a more monodisperse composition will have greater consistency of clinical effect.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      Hemoglobin also may be made by expression of alpha and beta globin genes in the same or different host cells, and subsequent assembly of the expressed alpha and beta globins, with heme, to form hemoglobin.
      <br/>
      While the introduction of suitable Cys codon mutations into the globin genes facilitates the production of a crosslinked multimeric hemoglobin, the expression product in general, will not be essentially monodisperse.
      <br/>
      Hemoglobin is composed of two alpha and two beta globin subunits.
      <br/>
      Both alpha globin subunits are natively expressed from a single alpha globin gene, and both beta globin subunits, from a single beta globin gene.
      <br/>
      Thus, if an alpha globin gene is expressed which contains a single Cys codon substitution, the assembled tetramer will contain two alpha globin subunits, each with a crosslinkable Cys.
      <br/>
      One Cys could crosslink to a second tetramer, and the other to a third, thus resulting in formation of a higher order oligomer.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      In one embodiment, the multimeric protein is an octamer consisting essentially of two tetramers which are covalently crosslinked.
      <br/>
      To avoid unwanted polymerization, each tetramer has only a single participating cysteinyl residue, whose thiol groups are reacted either with each other (under oxidizing conditions, forming a disulfide bond) or with a thiol-reactive crosslinking agent, to form the crosslink.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      A fused gene which encodes a single polypeptide comprising two globin-like domains may be mutated so as to provide an externally crosslinkable Cys in only one of the two otherwise substantially identical domains of the resulting pseudodimeric polypeptides.
      <br/>
      This pseudodimer may then be assembled with the complementary subunits to form a tetramer with only the single cysteine.
      <br/>
      Two such tetramers, finally, may be crosslinked to obtain the octamer, preferably in essentially monodisperse form.
    </p>
    <p num="67">If the formation of a higher order multimer, such as a dodecamer, is desired, the component pseudotetramers, each having a single externally crosslinkable cysteine, are each covalently attached to a reactive site of a polyfunctional crosslinker having a suitable half-life in the bloodstream.</p>
    <p num="68">
      Another way of obtaining a multimeric hemoglobin instead of crosslinking two or more pseudotetramers, is to combine their pseudodimeric subunits into a single pseudooligomer that is shared by all of the component pseudotetramers of the multimeric hemoglobin.
      <br/>
      For example a pseudooctameric polypeptide, comprising eight alpha globin-like domains, joined covalently by peptide bonds (typically with a peptide spacer), may be assembled with eight individual beta globin-like subunits to form a tetra-tetrameric human hemoglobin-like protein.
      <br/>
      Higher order multimers may be prepared simply by expressing a suitable pseudooligomer and assembling it with the complementary monomeric subunits.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The preparation of multimeric hemoglobins with a genetically fused pseudooligomeric backbone avoids the disadvantages of chemical crosslinking.
      <br/>
      The latter is inefficient and often requires deoxygenation of the hemoglobin solution and the presence of another molecule (e.g., inositol hexaphosphate or 2,3-DPG) to prevent competing reactions.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      In the embodiments discussed above, an essentially monodisperse multimeric hemoglobin is achieved by limiting the number of externally crosslinkable cysteines to one per tetramer.
      <br/>
      However, it is possible to have more than one externally crosslinkable cysteine per tetramer, provided that they are so positioned that after one is crosslinked to a foreign tetramer, other foreign tetramers are sterically prevented from crosslinking to the remaining cysteines of the original tetramer.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The multimeric proteins of the present invention, particularly at higher levels of polymerization, may prolong the half-life of recombinant hemoglobin by reducing extravasation and glomerular filtration of dissociated subunits in vivo compared to native human hemoglobin.
      <br/>
      Studies of halflife as a function of macromolecular size indicate a correlation between increased size and increased circulatory halflife for chemically crosslinked Hb as well as other macromolecules.
      <br/>
      Preferably, in humans, the half-life exceeds 9 hours at a dose of at least 1 gm/kgm body weight.
      <br/>
      This would be expected to correspond to a half-life of about 3 hours in rats given a comparable dose.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Intravascular retention may also be enhanced by engineering the tetramer crosslinking sites so that the haptoglobin binding sites of the tetramers are wholly or partially occluded.
      <br/>
      Independent mutations may also be made to sterically hinder haptoglobin binding, or to electrostatically repel or sterically hinder the approach of agents which otherwise might degrade the crosslink.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The multimeric proteins of the present invention may also increase oncotic pressure because the number of oxygen binding heme groups per polytetramer of order "n" is "n" times the number per tetramer.
      <br/>
      Independent of size, the oncotic pressure for a given concentration of heme groups in a solution of polytetrameric Hb is expected to be (1/n) times that of an equimolar solution of heme contained in tetrameric Hb.
      <br/>
      Because of oncotic pressure effects, the maximum concentration of free tetrameric Hb that may be introduced into the blood stream is less on a per volume basis than the concentration of Hb normally carried in intact red blood cells.
      <br/>
      Reduction of oncotic pressure is therefore useful in increasing the per volume oxygen carrying capacity of a blood substitute.
    </p>
    <p num="74">In a preferred embodiment, one or more globin-like domains contain mutations which reduce the oxygen-binding affinity of the hemoglobin analogue in solution so as to approach the oxygen-binding characteristics of whole blood.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="75">
      FIG. 1 Plasmid pSGE1.1E4. This plasmid bears a polycistronic operon which comprises the pTAC promoter and genes encoding a di-alpha globin and a beta globin. It also carries tetracycline and ampicillin resistance genes, and the lacI gene.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2a-2e Shows the sequence �SEQ ID NO:1� of a preferred synthetic gene for expression of (des-Val)-alpha-(Gly)-alpha and des-Val beta globin. This gene is carried by pSGE1.1E4. A shows the region (EcoRI to PstI) containing Shine-Delgarno ribosomal binding sites (SD-1 and SD-2), the sequence expressing the octapeptide (Met . . . Glu) (SEQ ID NO:23) which serves as a cotranslational coupler, and the sequence encoding the two nearly identical alpha globin-like polypeptides and the interposed Gly-Gly linker. The first alpha globin sequence begins "Met-Leu", that is, it contains an artifactual methionine, omits the valine which is the normal first residue of mature alpha globin, and continues with the second residue, leucine. The residues are numbered 1 to 141 (SEQ ID NO:24). The second alpha globin sequence begins "Val-Leu", immediately after the underlined "Gly-Gly" linker. The residues are numbered 1' to 141' (SEQ ID NO:25). Start and stop codons are underlined. B shows the analogous region (PstI to HindIII) containing the coding sequence for des-Val beta globin. The beta residues are numbered 1 to 146. (SEQ ID NO.26). A and B are connected at the PstI site to form a single polycistronic operon.
      <br/>
      When a three letter amino acid code is singly underlined, this indicates that the residue is a potential site for an Xaa --&gt; Cys mutation to provide a crosslinkable site. The mutations should be made asymmetrically, i.e., in only one region of a di-alpha or di-beta gene, so only one crosslink is added per tetramer. While, in FIGS. 2a-2e, show the sites are marked only on the first copy of the alpha gene, they could instead be in the second copy. For convenience, the appropriate beta globin mutation sites are also marked. However, these mutations should be made in only one beta-globin of a di-beta globin gene.
      <br/>
      Doubly underlined amino acid codes identify sites where formation of two disulfide bonds (or per subunit) would be sterically hindered, so use of a di-alpha or di-beta construction is unnecessary.
      <br/>
      Residues which are candidate sites for mutations to block haptoglobin binding are boxed.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 is a stylized representation of one form of pseudooctameric Hgb, in which the octameric hemoglobin is formed by linking or crosslinking two molecules of an asymmetric di-alpha Hgb.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 4a-4b depict coiled coil crosslinkers suitable for a joining (a) four or (b) six Hgb tetramers. FIG. 4 is a top view of a 4-helical bundle, with attachment sites marked.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="76">Definitions</p>
    <p num="77">
      A hemoglobin is a protein which contains heme (ferroprotoporphyrin IX) and that binds oxygen at a respiratory surface (skin, gills, trachea, lung, etc.) and transports the oxygen to inner tissues, where it is released and used for metabolism.
      <br/>
      In nature, low molecular weight hemoglobins (16-120 kilodaltons) tend to be enclosed in circulating red blood cells while the larger polymeric hemoglobins circulate freely in the blood or hemolymph.
    </p>
    <p num="78">For the purpose of the appended claims, a hemoglobin-like protein is a protein with the following characteristics:</p>
    <p num="79">
      (a) it is sufficiently soluble in blood to be clinically useful as a blood substitute;
      <br/>
      (b) it reversibly binds oxygen, under physiological conditions;
      <br/>
      (c) each polypeptide chain comprises at least one globin-like domain (as defined below); and
      <br/>
      (d) each globin-like domain bears (or is capable of incorporating) a heme prosthetic group;
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      A multimeric hemoglobin-like protein is further characterized as follows:
      <br/>
      (e) it is composed of two or more polypeptide chains;
      <br/>
      (f) it is composed of two or more tetramers, each tetramer comprising four globin-like-domains, and
      <br/>
      (g) each component tetramer is covalently attached to at least one other component tetramer.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      Preferably, the hemoglobin-like proteins of the present invention have a PSD of 2 to 45 -torr, more preferably 24 to 32 torr, at 37 (degree)  C., in blood.
      <br/>
      Preferably, they also exhibit some degree of cooperativity.
      <br/>
      Also, they desirably have an intravascular retention at least comparable to that of normal human hemoglobin administered as a blood substitute.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Tetrameric hemoglobin-like proteins have four globin-like domains, octameric hemoglobin-like proteins have eight globin-like domains, and so forth.
      <br/>
      The term "multimeric" covers any hemoglobin-like protein comprising (4 * n) globin-like domains, where n&gt;1.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      A pseudomeric hemoglobin-like protein is one for which the number of globin-like domains is greater than the number of component polypeptide chains, i.e., at least one chain comprises at least two globin-like domains.
      <br/>
      The pseudoheterotetrameric hemoglobin-like proteins, for example, may be composed of (a) one di-alpha globin-like and two beta globin-like polypeptides, (b) two alpha globin-like and one di-beta globin-like polypeptides, (c) one di-alpha globin-like and one di-beta globin-like polypeptides, (d) one fused alpha/beta globin-like polypeptide and separate alpha and beta globin-like polypeptides, or (e) two fused alpha/beta globin-like polypeptides.
      <br/>
      The term "tetramer" includes "pseudotetramers."
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      A "genetically fused hemoglobin" is a hemoglobin-like protein comprising at least one "genetically fused globin-like polypeptide", (globin pseudooligomer), the latter comprising two or more globin-like domains which may be the same or different and which are connected directly, or through an amino acid or peptide linker.
      <br/>
      A di-alpha globin-like polypeptide is one which consists, essentially of two alpha-globin-like polypeptide sequences (domains) connected by peptide bonds between the normal C- terminus of the first alpha-globin-like polypeptide (domain) and the normal N-terminus of the second alpha-globin-like polypeptide (domain).
      <br/>
      These two sequences may be directly connected, or connected through a peptide linker of one or more amino acids; the term "peptide bonds" is intended to embrace both possibilities.
      <br/>
      Alpha globin chains crosslinked at the N- and C-terminals other than by peptide bonds (e.g., by DIDS) are not di-alpha globins.
      <br/>
      The di-alpha globin-like polypeptide must be capable of folding together with beta globin and incorporating heme to form functional hemoglobin-like protein.
      <br/>
      The di-beta globin-like polypeptide is analogously defined.
      <br/>
      A di-alpha or di-beta globin-like polypeptide with a mutation in only one of the component domains is called "asymmetric".
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      It is also possible to provide an "alpha/beta-globin-like pseudodimer" in which an alpha globin-like sequence is connected by peptide bonds to a beta globin-like sequence.
      <br/>
      This "alpha/beta globin-like polypeptide", and the di-alpha and di-beta globin-like polypeptides, may collectively be referred to as "pseudodimeric globin-like polypeptides" or as "diglobins".
      <br/>
      By extension, a hemoglobin-like protein comprising a di-alpha, a di-beta, or a alpha/beta globin-like polypeptide is a "pseudotetramer".
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Pseudotetramers which bear only a single externally crosslinkable cysteine may be referred, by way of shorthand, as "mono-cys" molecules.
      <br/>
      However, the use of this term should not be taken as implying that the tetramer may not comprise other cysteines.
      <br/>
      A "mono-cys" pseudotetramer is merely one which has only a single cysteine which can participate to a significant degree in crosslinking reactions with a cysteine residue of a second pseudotetramer.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      A hemoglobin-like protein is said to be heteromeric if at least two of its globin-like domains are different.
      <br/>
      Since conventional human hemoglobin is composed of two alpha globins and two beta globins, it is a heterotetramer.
      <br/>
      A multimeric human hemoglobin-like protein is a heteromer wherein-each-tetramer or pseudotetramer has two human alpha globin-like domains and two human beta globin-like domains.
    </p>
    <p num="88">The Globin-Like Domain</p>
    <p num="89">
      The globin-like domains may be, but need not be, one per polypeptide chain, and they need not correspond exactly in sequence to the alpha and beta globins of normal human-hemoglobin.
      <br/>
      Rather, mutations may be introduced to alter the oxygen affinity (or its cooperativity, or its (dependence on pH, salt, temperature, or other environmental parameters) or stability (to heat, acid, alkali, or other denaturing agents) of the hemoglobin, to facilitate genetic fusion or crosslinking, or to increase the ease of expression and assembly of the individual chains.
      <br/>
      Guidance as to certain types of mutations is provided, e.g., by Hoffman and Nagi, U.S. Pat. No. 5,028,588, and Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 07/443,950, abandoned, incorporated by reference herein.
      <br/>
      The present invention further includes molecules which depart from those taught herein by gratuitous mutations which do not substantially affect biological activity.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      A "globin-like domain" is a polypeptide domain which is substantially homologous with a globin subunit of a naturally occurring hemoglobin.
      <br/>
      A "vertebrate," "mammalian" or "human" globin-like domain is one which is substantially homologous with a globin subunit oft respectively, a naturally occurring vertebrate, mammalian or human hemoglobin.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      A human alpha globin-like domain or polypeptide is native human alpha globin or a mutant thereof differing from the native sequence by one or more substitutions, deletions or insertions, while remaining substantially homologous (as hereafter defined) with human alpha globin, and still capable of incorporating heme and associating with beta globin.
      <br/>
      The term "human alpha globin-like domain" is intended to include but not be limited to naturally occurring human alpha globins, including normal human alpha globin.
      <br/>
      A beta globin-like domain or polypeptide is analogously defined.
      <br/>
      Subunits of animal hemoglobins or mutants thereof which are sufficiently homologous with human alpha or beta globin are embraced by the term "human alpha or beta globin-like domain or polypeptide." For example, the subunits of bovine hemoglobin are within the scope of these terms.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      In determining whether a polypeptide is substantially homologous to alpha (or beta) globin, sequence similarity is an important but not exclusive criterion.
      <br/>
      Sequence similarity may be determined by conventional algorithms, which typically allow introduction of a small number of gaps in order to achieve the best fit.
      <br/>
      A human alpha-globin-like domain will typically have at least about 75% sequence identity with wild-type human alpha globin, and greater homology with human alpha globin than with human beta globin.
      <br/>
      However, a polypeptide of lesser sequence identity may still be considered "substantially homologous" with alpha globin if it has a greater sequence identity than would be expected from chance and also has the characteristic higher structure (e.g., the "myoglobin fold") of alpha globin, the ability to incorporate heme, and oxygen-binding activity. (Note that, as elsewhere explained, an alteration in oxygen affinity (P50), intravascular retention, or cooperativity may be desired, and does not render the mutant nonhomologous if it can still contribute to reversible oxygen-binding activity.) By way of comparison, Artemia's heme-binding domains are considered homologous with myoglobin even though the primary sequence similarity is no more than 27%, as alignment of the heme- binding domains around their conserved residues and the residues conserved in other hemoglobins (i.e., involved in heme contacts or in determining the relationship of the helical segments to each other) suggested that the Artemia domains possessed the classical globin helices A to H with their corresponding turns; as well as various conserved globin family residues.
      <br/>
      Also, among the serine protease inhibitors, there are families of proteins recognized to be homologous in which there are pairs of members with as little as 30% sequence homology.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Over a hundred mutants of human hemoglobin are known, affecting both the alpha and beta chains, and the effect of many of these mutations on oxygen-binding and other characteristics of hemoglobin are known.
      <br/>
      The human alpha and beta globins themselves differ at 84 positions.
      <br/>
      In addition, interspecies variations in globin sequence have been extensively studied.
      <br/>
      Dickerson, Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution and Pathology, ch. 3 (1983) reported that in 1982, the 60 known vertebrate alpha globins had identical residues at 23 of their 141 positions, while for the 66 vertebrate beta globins considered, 20 of the 146 amino acids are identical.
      <br/>
      The 60 vertebrate myoglobins, which also belong to the globin family, had 27 invariant amino acids out of 153 positions.
      <br/>
      If only mammals are considered, then the invariant amino acids are 50/141 for the alpha globins, 51/146 for the beta globins, and 71/153 for the myoglobins.
      <br/>
      Invariant positions cluster around the centers of activity of the molecule: the heme crevice and the intersubunit contacts of the variable amino acids, some diverge from the consensus sequence for only a small fraction of the species considered..
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      The number of total differences between human alpha globin- and selected other vertebrate alpha globins is as follows: rhesus monkey (4), cow (17), platypus (39), chicken (35), human zeta (embryonic) (61), carp (71), and shark (88).
      <br/>
      For invertebrate globins the divergences are sea lamprey (113), mollusc (124), Glycera (marine bloodworm) (124) and Chironomus (midge) (131).
      <br/>
      Turning to the beta globin family, the differences of human beta globin from other vertebrate beta globins are rhesus monkey (8), human delta globin (10), cow beta globin (25), cow gamma globin (33), human gamma globin (39), human epsilon (embryonic) globin (36), platypus (34), chicken (45), shark (96), sea lamprey (123), mollusc (127), Glycera (125) and Chironomus (128).
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Many of these differences may be misleading--variable amino acids may exhibit only "conservative substitutions" of one amino acid for another, functionally equivalent one.
      <br/>
      A "conservative substitution" is a substitution which does not abolish the ability of a globin- like polypeptide (or domain) to incorporate heme and to associate with alpha and beta globin subunits to form a tetrameric (or pseudotetrameric) hemoglobin-like protein which, in keeping with the definition thereof, will reversibly bind oxygen.
      <br/>
      The following resources may be used to identify conservative substitutions (and deletions or insertions):
      <br/>
      (a) data on functional hemoglobin mutants (over a hundred such mutants exist);
      <br/>
      (b) data on sequence variations among vertebrate, especially mammalian, alpha globins and beta globins;
      <br/>
      (c) data on sequence variations among vertebrate, especially mammalian, myoglobins;
      <br/>
      (d) data on sequence variations between vertebrate and invertebrate, globins, or among the invertebrate globins;
      <br/>
      (e) data on the three-dimensional structures of human hemoglobin and other oxygen-binding proteins, and molecular modelling software for predicting the effect of sequence changes on such structures; and
      <br/>
      (f) data on the frequencies of amino acid changes between members of families of homologous proteins (not limited to the globin family).
      <br/>
      See, e.g., Table 1-2 of Schulz and Schirmer, Principles of Protein Structure (Springer- Verlag: 1979) and FIG. 3-9 of Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties (W.H. Freeman: 1983).

      While the data from (a)-(d) is most useful in determining tolerable mutations at the site of variation in the cognate proteins, it may also be helpful in identifying tolerable mutations at analogous sites elsewhere in the molecule.
      <br/>
      Based on the data in category (f), the following exchange groups may be identified, within which substitutions of amino acids are frequently conservative:
      <br/>
      I small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues--Ala, Ser, Thr (Pro, Gly)
      <br/>
      II negatively charged residues and their amides l --Asn, Asp, Glu, Gln
      <br/>
      III positively charged residues--His, Arg, Lys
      <br/>
      IV large aliphatic nonpolar residues--Met, Leu, Ile, Val (Cys)
      <br/>
      V large aromatic residues--Phe, Tyr, Trp

      Three residues are parenthesized because of their special roles in protein architecture.
      <br/>
      Gly is the only residue without a side chain and therefore imparts flexibility to the chain.

      Pro has an unusual geometry which tightly constrains the chain.

      Cys can participate in disulfide bonds which hold proteins into a particular folding.

      In general, functionality is less likely to be affected by mutations at surface residues, at least those not involved in either the heme crevice or the subunit contacts.

      The term "low affinity hemoglobin-like protein" refers to a hemoglobin-like protein having a P50 which is at least 10% greater than the P50 of cell free normal hemoglobin Ao under the same conditions.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the protein, if used as a blood substitute, qualifies as a low affinity protein, and more preferably, its P50 is closer to the P50 of whole blood cells than to that of cell free hemoglobin.

    <p num="104">
      Low affinity mutant hemoglobins, i.e., those with "right shifted" oxygen equilibrium binding curves relative to cell-free normal hemoglobin, have many potential uses.
      <br/>
      Most notably, mutant hemoglobins that have an oxygen affinity similar to whole red blood cells may be used as an oxygen- carrying transfusion substitute in place of donated red blood cells, eliminating the risk of infection and alleviating problems with supply.
      <br/>
      Cell-free native human hemoglobin cannot function as a transfusion substitute, among other reasons because oxygen is bound too tightly.
      <br/>
      In addition, because cell-free hemoglobin solutions do not need to be cross-matched and are expected to have a longer shelf life than whole blood, low affinity hemoglobin solutions may be widely used in situations where whole blood transfusion is not feasible, for, example in an ambulance or on a battlefield, Mutant hemoglobins that have an even lower oxygen affinity than red blood cells may in fact delivery oxygen more effectively in many situations.
      <br/>
      Mutant hemoglobins that have a somewhat higher oxygen affinity than whole blood (but a lower affinity than cell-free native human hemoglobin) will still function as an adequate transfusion substitute and may in fact deliver oxygen more effectively than red blood cells in some situations.
      <br/>
      This is because oxygen is released directly to plasma form hemoglobin-based solutions, without the need to diffuse through the red cell membrane, and because cell-free hemoglobin may penetrate into regions not accessible to red blood cells.
      <br/>
      As an example, low affinity mutant hemoglobin is expected to deliver oxygen effectively during coronary artery balloon angioplasty procedures, whereas circulation of red blood cells is obstructed during such procedures.
      <br/>
      Low affinity mutant hemoglobin may also be useful as a perfusion component in organ preservation prior to transplantation or as a mammalian cell culture additive.

    <p num="105">Possible low affinity mutants are discussed in detail, by way of example and not of limitation, in Table 1 (natural low affinity hemoglobin mutants) and Table 2 (candidate non-naturally occurring low affinity hemoglobin mutants) of Hoffman, et al., U.S. Pat.

      An unexpected and surprising change in oxygen binding characteristics of hemoglobin was observed upon replacement of the N-terminal valine with methionine.

      Hemoglobin A, purified from blood a P50 value of 4.03 with N=2.8 when measured at 25 (degree)  C. DesFX-Fab produced in E. coli, a hemoglobin identical to A except for the addition of a methionine at the N-termini of the alpha and beta chains, has essentially the same P50 and N values.
      <br/>
      Thus, the addition of a methionine, without altering the adjacent valine residue, has little or no effect on oxygen binding.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a higher P50 value, 6.6, was observed for desVal-Hab produced in E. coli, a hemoglobin in which the normal N-terminal valine of each chain was replaced with. methionine.
      <br/>
      Cooperativity, as measured by N, was virtually the same, however, for all three molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      A similar comparison was made for two hemoglobins each containing the Presbyterian mutation, one produced in E. coli and one in yeast.
      <br/>
      The E. coli hemoglobin was constructed with a Des-Val alpha chain, i.e., the N-terminus had the normal valine replaced with methionine oxygen binding was characterized by P50 =19.8, N=2.5 at 25 (degree)  C. and by P50 =34.5 and N=2.5 at 37 (degree)  C. The corresponding yeast coding region begins with an additional methionine codon in front of the normal valine codon.
      <br/>
      Because this initial methionine is removed post translationally in vivo, the purified hemoglobin has a normal N-terminal valine.
      <br/>
      For this molecule, P50 =23 to 25 and N=2.5 when measured at 37 (degree)  C. Thus, in the above instances, the replacement of an N-terminal valine with an N- terminal methionine increased the P50 value.
      <br/>
      Under physiological conditions, it is expected that the genetically fused Presbyterian hemoglobin produced in E. coli will deliver 20-30% more oxygen than the similar hemoglobin, with its altered N-terminus, produced in yeast.

      High affinity mutant hemoglobin may have utility in certain situations.
      <br/>
      For example, perfluorocarbon-based blood substitute preparations are under clinical study for enhancement of radiation therapy and certain chemotherapy treatments of solid tumors (Dowling, S., Fischer, J. J., and Rockwell, S. (1991) Biomat.

      <br/>
      Biotech, 19, 399.) The basis of these investigations is the fact that oxygen is a required component of the cell toxicity action of radiation and certain chemotherapy reagents.
      <br/>
      Solid tumors frequently exhibit extremely low partial oxygen pressure in the interior of the tumor, rendering therapy inefficient.
      <br/>
      Perfluorocarbon-based oxygen-carrying solutions appear to dramatically enhance certain tumor therapies, and hemoglobin- based blood substitutes are expected to have a similar utility.
      <br/>
      It is likely that cell-free hemoglobin unlike whole red blood cells, will be able to penetrate the interior region of tumors for delivery of oxygen.
      <br/>
      Actual percent of oxygen released by a cell-free hemoglobin preparation is not a direct function of P50 but rather depends on the shape of the oxygen equilibrium binding curve between the two pressures representing the partial oxygen pressure of the lungs (where oxygen is loaded onto hemoglobin) and the partial pressure of the tissue where oxygen is unloaded.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible that a high affinity mutant hemoglobin would be preferred as a tumor therapy adjuvant.
      <br/>
      A high affinity hemoglobin would retain its bound oxygen throughout the normal circulatory system, where partial oxygen pressure remains relatively high, but release its oxygen in the extremely oxygen-depleted tumor interior.
      <br/>
      Normal or low affinity hemoglobin might have less oxygen available for release by the time it reaches the interior of the tumor.

      This is because the cysteines on adjacent tetramers (including pseudotetramers) can be oxidized to form a disulfide bridge, covalently coupling the tetramers.

      <br/>
      A mutation does not necessarily have to meet all of the above requirements to be useful.
      <br/>

      The mechanism of these reactions involves the thiolate anion as the actual reducing species (Creighton, T. E. (1978) Proc. Biophys. Molec. Biol., 33:259-260; Creighton, T. E. (1975) J. Mol. Biol., 96:767; Creighton, T. E. (1977). J. Mol. Biol., 113:313).

      Thus the rate of reduction will be a function of the molecular electrostatic environment in the vicinity of the disulfide bond.
      <br/>
      A slower rate of reduction would be predicted if the disulfide was located.
      <br/>
      In an electrostatically negative environment, due to the repulsion of the thiolate anion.

      Although formation of the initial disulfide bond between two such cysteines might also be slower because of repulsion between the negative charges on the two hemoglobin molecules in the vicinity of the cysteines, the reaction could be facilitated by use of high salt, or high pH during the in vitro bond formation reaction.

      Oxyhemoglobin dissociates into alpha-beta dimers, which are then bound by haptoglobin.

      In the oxy and deoxy crystal structures of human hemoglobin Ao, the distance between these termini is 5.22  Angstrom  and 17.93  Angstrom  respectively (from the N-terminal nitrogen to the C terminal carbon of the carboxylate).
      <br/>
      A single glycine linker,.which is a little less than 4  Angstrom  in length, may come close to linking the two termini in the oxy structure, however, it is expected that this linker will fall - 14  Angstrom  short in the deoxy structure.
      <br/>
      Significantly more perturbation of the deoxy structure vs the oxy structure might be anticipated with this linker.
      <br/>
      Some alterations in the oxygen binding properties may be caused by deletion of the positive and negative charges at the two termini and their inclusion in the amide bond.
      <br/>
      In addition, the linker molecule itself may destabilize the oxy structure less than the deoxy structure, and thus lead to a relative increase in oxygen affinity.
      <br/>
      Likewise, two glycines inserted as linkers may also differentially stabilize the oxy structure and hence relatively increase the oxygen affinity by the same mechanism described above.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      When the number of linking glycines is increased to 5, the linker should just span the cleft between the beta chain termini in the deoxy structure, and, moreover, insert added steric bulk between the termini in the oxy structure, thus leading to a relative stabilization of deoxy (or destabilization of oxy) and perhaps resulting in a concomitant decrease in oxygen affinity.
      <br/>
      Due to the large space between the beta termini in the deoxy (but not the oxy structure), addition of glycine linkers in the range of 6-9 may further stabilize the oxy structure and, in the same manner, further decrease oxygen affinity.

      A third form of globin pseudodimer is one comprising both alpha and beta globin domains.
      <br/>
      A possible route to fusing alpha1 to beta2 and so stabilizing hemoglobin against  ALPHA 1 BETA 1 / ALPHA 2 BETA 2 dimer formation, is to fuse the alpha1 C-terminal residue to the N-terminal residue of beta2 C helix, creating a new C-terminus at the end of the beta2 B helix.
      <br/>
      The original beta N terminus, Val1, would be fused to the original beta subunit C-terminal residue, His146, by means of an intervening new section of protein, thus creating a continuous polypeptide chain comprising the alpha and beta subunits of different dimers.
      <br/>
      This chain may be described as follows: (des-Val)  ALPHA (1-14) -Gly3 - BETA (35-146)-Gly1-3 -Ala13 -Gly1-3 - BETA (1-34) SEQ ID NO:27; see FIG. 6.

      Inspection of the structure of human deoxyhemoglobin using a molecular graphics computer indicates the following relevant distances.

      The distance between the Alpha1 Arg141 carboxyl carbon and Beta2 Tyr35 N-atoms is approximately 8.6 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      A fully extended linear triglycine peptide measured approximately 10.1 Angstroms from the N to C terminal residues.
      <br/>
      This suggests that three glycine residues could be employed to span the distance between the Arg141 and Tyr35 residues with a minimum of unfavorable steric interactions and maximum conformational freedom.
      <br/>
      The distance requirements could be different in oxyhemoglobin, and if so, the sequence of the fusion peptide could be altered to best accommodate the requirements of both structures.

      <br/>
      Additionally, the amino acid sequence of the helix could be altered to introduce favorable hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between the new helix and the Beta2 helix against which it would pack in the folded protein.

      Such interactions could aid stabilization of the engineered protein.

      Glycine is the preferred amino acid in the linkers, since it is known to be quite flexible, Cantor and Schimmel, Biophysical Chemistry, part 1, pp. 266-9 (1980), and also allows chains into which it is incorporated to assume a more compact structure.
      <br/>
      However, the residues comprising the linker are not limited to glycines; other residues may be included instead of or in addition to glycine, such as alanine, serine, or threonine.
      <br/>
      Since these amino acids have a more restricted conformational space in a protein, they will likely result in more rigid linking chains, and hence have a more pronounced effect on the relative stabilization/destabilization of the oxy/deoxy structures.

      It should be understood that the minimum and maximum number of amino acids in the linker is a function of the distance to be spanned in both the oxy or deoxy forms, the amino acids chosen, and the propensity of the particular amino acid sequence to form a secondary structure.
      <br/>
      While a random coil is usually preferred, it is not required, and a linker with a large number of amino acids in a secondary structure may have the same span as a random coil linker with fewer amino acids.

      <br/>
      In a fully extended chain, the maximum translation per residue is 3.63  Angstrom  if the repeating units are staggered and 3.8  Angstrom  if the peptide bond, is trans.

      Correlations of molecular weight with serum half life for proteins such as IL-2, demonstrate that a significantly longer half life may be expected as the molecular weight of a protein increases, particularly above the renal filtration limit of 50-70 kDa.

      However, a factor potentially limiting the half life of multimeric hemoglobin formed by a disulfide link between tetramers is reduction of the cys-cys disulfide bond by endogenous thiol-reducing agents found in the serum.

      This may be reflected in the diminished half life seen with antibody-ricin A chains conjugates linked by regular disulfides (6.7 hrs) relative to conjugates linked with sterically hindered, and thus less reducible, alpha-methyl disulfides (42.5 hours).

      The side products would still be octamers, with one attachment site being a secondary amine and thus might well be functionally equivalent to the S-crosslinked octamers.

      This reaction resulted in a polydisperse mixture of monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric species with an average stoichiometry of peg/hemoglobin of 6.2. However, 83% of the hemoglobin derivatized by peg was not crosslinked to another hemoglobin molecule.

      With a peptide linker of considerable length, there is the concern that it will be degraded by serum proteases, thus degrading the multimeric hemoglobin into its component tetramers, This problem, if significant, may be remedied by use of a peptide linker which is less susceptible to proteolysis.

      Another example is the 2-stranded coiled coil, in which two peptide chains intertwine.

      A hypothetical 4-tetramer coiled-coil linker complex is shown in FIG. 4a. Design and synthesis of these coiled coil peptides has already been explored (for an example see Cohen and Perry, Proteins, 7:1-15 (1990)).
      <br/>
      The rationale for a coiled coil is that two intertwined alpha helices will be less sensitive to proteolytic cleavage than a single naked secondary structure like an extended peptide (rapidly cleaved by proteases), an alpha helix or a beta sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="188">
      Using molecular modeling, an internal disulfide may be designed in the center of a bi-functional coiled coil linker such that the strands are covalently attached.
      <br/>
      This should stabilize formation of the correct coiled coil crosslinker before mono-cys di-alpha or di-beta Hgb (e.g., sge1.1 cys) is attached.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a tri-functional crosslinker can be stabilized by use of a orthogonally-protected lysine (lys-FMOC) rather than a disulfide in the center of a proteolytically inert secondary structure.
      <br/>
      A polyproline helix can be used as the linker, and can be stabilized by branching the synthesis at the lys-FMOC after removal of the side chain.
      <br/>
      The three remaining lysines in the branched peptide would then be iodoacetylated to site-specifically attach a thiol-reactive group using either iodoacetic anhydride or N-succinimidyliodo-acetate and subsequently reacted with sge1.1-cys. An analogous tetra-functional crosslinker could be synthesized by inserting 1-2 prolines between two internal branching lysines to rotate them such that the two internal branching chains growing off the orthogonally protected lysines head- in (nearly) opposite directions.
      <br/>
      Analogous structures could be made using D-glutamate(E) or D-aspartate(D) to provide protease resistance, and these would form an extended polyanionic chain at pH 7.

      The sequence of a hypothetical alpha-helical coiled coil is modified from that given in Semchuck, et al., in Peptides: Chemistry, Structure and Biology; 566 (Rivier and Marshall, eds:1990), to leave only two lysines (K) at each end:
      <br/>
      Ac-Lys-Cys-Ala-Glu-Leu-Glu-Gly-Arg-Leu-Glu-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gly-Arg-Leu-Glu-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gly-Arg-Leu-Glu-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gly-Arg-Leu-Glu-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gly-Lys-Leu-amide (SEQ ID NO: 8).
    </p>
    <p num="190">
      This coiled coil should have about 10 turns of a helix and thus will be ca. 54  Angstrom  long, allowing two tetramers to attach on each side without steric interference.

    <p num="193">
      Another possibility is an 8-hemoglobin complex (FIG. 4b. The rationale for considering this sort of complex is that it may be the way to obtain a very long half-life, due to the extreme stability of the "crosslinker" and the substantially higher molecular weight of the complex.
      <br/>
      The crosslinker might take the form of a doubly branched coiled coil, with a Lys(FMOC) replacing an Arg in the middle of the chain to allow the branching, and with a polyproline helix or other protease resistant secondary structure comprising the branching moiety.
      <br/>
      This structure could allow attachment of 6 SGE1.1s per crosslinker.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a 4-helical bundle protein (See FIG. 4(c)) or 4-stranded coiled-coil such as those synthesized by DeGrado, Science, 243:622 (1989), with each helix in the 4-helical bundle containing the consensus sequence Gly-Glu-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu-Leu-Lys-Lys-Leu-Lys-Glu-Leu-Leu-Lys-Gly (SEQ ID NO:9) the helices being linked by three PRR or RPR loops, could be utilized as a suitable core for the linker.
      <br/>
      This is one of the most stable proteins known, with a G=-22 kcal/mole separating the folded from the unfolded state.
      <br/>
      Each helix would be 4+ turns or ca. 22  Angstrom  long.
      <br/>
      Since this may not be enough room to fit two hemoglobins with one anchored at each end of the helix, they might have to be attached to different faces of the same helix, to lysines placed at each end of the polar face of each helix.
      <br/>
      Each helix is amphipathic; this should allow relative freedom to have a total of 8 lysines (and no more) and to change the remaining lysines to arginines.
      <br/>
      At least two of the i, i+4 salt bridges per helix would be retained for stability of the protein.
      <br/>
      Attachment of an externally crosslinkable cysteine-bearing tetramer could be via iodoacetylation of the lysine epsilon amino groups and then reaction with the thiol group of the cysteine.
    </p>
    <p num="194">
      An example of a modification that might allow more room between tetramers would be addition of one turn of the helix to the N-terminus of the A and C helices and the C-terminus of the B and D helices.
      <br/>
      This and similar modifications would be subject to modeling and experimental constraints.
    </p>
    <p num="195">Analogous core proteins could be made as mutants of known 4-helical bundle proteins such as myohemerythrin or apoferritin, with the surface residues changed so that 8 (or more if topologically possible) lysines (2 per helix) exist on the surface for subsequent modification and attachment of the tetramer.</p>
    <p num="196">Poly(tetrameric) Hemoglobins with Reduced Isoelectric Points</p>
    <p num="197">
      If the isoelectric point of the whole crosslinked conjugate also affects the serum half life, via electrostatic exclusion from the renal filter's "pore", additional negative charges could be included in the crosslink itself (rather than in the hemoglobin, which could change the function of the molecule) to drop the isoelectric point of the overall crosslinked particle.
      <br/>
      An additional benefit of this might be reduced uptake by the reticuloendothelial system, this uptake being a function of pI for cationized albumin.
    </p>
    <p num="198">
      We have preliminary evidence from succinylation of SGE1.1 which correlates the number of modified lysines with isoelectric point.
      <br/>
      This gives a rough estimate of the number of lys to glu and/or lys to asp mutations which may be necessary to reach a pI of 5 or less, the pI range which we expect we need to significantly extend half life.
      <br/>
      We believe that as many as 8 lysines may have to be modified (a total shift in charge of 16 units) to drop the pI roughly 2 units.
      <br/>
      It should be less disruptive of the functional properties of hemoglobin to do this via a peptide crosslinker rather than by mutation of the alpha and beta globin subunits proper.
      <br/>
      However, some mutations could be made in the crosslinker and the remainder in the subunits.
      <br/>
      As before, the SGE1.1-cys would be attached to iodoacetylated lysine epsilon amino groups by reaction at pH 6.5-7 0 (slashed zero)
    </p>
    <p num="199">
      For human serum albumin in the rat, the half life varied roughly linearly with the pI of the protein, from ca. 4.6 hours for native albumin (pI=4) to 0.8 hrs at a pI above 9.5. Clearance was probably by multiple mechanisms, including potentially increased uptake into the reticuloendothelial system with increased pI.
      <br/>
      For rat trypsinogens, the difference in serum half life between versions with a pI of 5.-0 (t1/2 of 4 min) was even larger.
      <br/>
      Thus a lower pI clearly appears to be an important variable in the serum half life of these proteins.

      We have determined the minimum of the intertetramer linker as follows.
      <br/>
      Two structures of human hemoglobin AO (either both in the oxy form or both in the deoxy form) taken or assembled from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank were docked as close together as possible without van der Waals overlap between any residues, using the program Insight (Biosym. Inc., San Diego, Calif.).
      <br/>
      The distance from the alpha chain C terminal residue arg 141 to the amino terminal nitrogen of the alpha chain N terminal residue val 1 (in one structure) was then measured.
      <br/>
      This distance was ca. 22  Angstrom  when both molecules had the oxy structure and ca. 18  Angstrom  when both were in the deoxy structure.
      <br/>
      In the oxy and deoxy structures, the valine at the alpha chain N terminus is exposed at the side of a cleft in the structure, while the arg carboxylate is at the bottom of the cleft.
      <br/>
      Thus it is possible to genetically fuse these two termini without suffering a large structural displacement of residues around either terminal amino acid.
      <br/>
      A suitable intertetramer linker will be at least 18-22 angstroms long, preferably longer in order to give the structure additional flexibility.
      <br/>
      There is no fixed upper limit on the length of the linker, however, the longer the linker, the more susceptible it is to protease, and, if the molecule appears large enough, it may be phagocytosed by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system.
      <br/>
      A few examples of suitable linkers are listed below.

      An alternative fusion may be envisioned between a truncated alpha chain in one hemoglobin and the N terminal alpha val 1 in the second hemoglobin.

      The first molecule could be truncated at ser 138, which intermolecular N terminal to C terminal distance is about 17  Angstrom  (deoxy) and 22  Angstrom  (oxy), and examples of genetically inserted linkers spanning this distance are listed below.

      Thus two hemoglobin molecules could be linked (by fusing two intermolecular alpha domains) to generate a fusion protein approximately twice the size of normal human hemoglobin.

      An additional intramolecular crosslink, as introduced into rHb1.1 to prevent dissociation of hemoglobin into dimers, could be included as well, giving a fusion of four alpha domains.
    </p>
    <p num="212">
      We expect that the genetically inserted links will be stable in the presence of proteases, due to the steric occlusion by the two hemoglobins surrounding the linkage.
      <br/>
      This resistance may be further enhanced by the use of glycines, bonds between which may be less susceptible to proteases, since most proteases have side chain specificity for residues other than glycine (which has only a hydrogen as a sidechain, and thus may result in a poor Km of this substrate for a protease).
      <br/>
      A polyproline helix may also be used as a linker to enhance stability to proteases.
      <br/>
      Fusion of a polyglutamate or polyaspartate as a linker might allow a much lower isoelectric point for the complex, and thus a longer serum half life.

    <p num="217">It is possible to produce an octameric hemoglobin, without substantial production of higher multimers, by suitable cypteine mutation of either the alpha or beta chain (see FIGS. 5a-5c).</p>
    <p num="218">
      Hemoglobin mutants containing one X to cys mutation in the beta chain gene (giving two per tetramer) or in the alpha chain gene (also giving two per tetramer), in which the residues mutated to cysteine are both on or very close to the surface of the subunit and are as close to the dyad axis separating the subunits, may form octamers (two hemoglobins) linked by two disulfides.
      <br/>
      Polymerization of such mutants should be retarded by the proximity of the two disulfides to each other, such that after one disulfide is formed, a third incoming hemoglobin will be sterically hindered from reacting with either free cysteine on the two original hemoglobins.
    </p>
    <p num="219">
      Because it is possible that this mutant may form higher order polymers (rather than simply the octamer), a diluted solution nay be used in vitro for formation of disulfide bonds.
      <br/>
      The kinetics of polymerization of hemoglobin should be at least second order (or a higher order) in hemoglobin concentration, while after one disulfide is formed, the formation of the second disulfide between two tetramers should be zero order in hemoglobin.
      <br/>
      Thus the ratio of polymerized product to octamer should diminish as the hemoglobin concentration is decreased.
      <br/>
      If formation of octamers is done under oxygenated conditions, the yield of octamers vs. polymers may increase further, since the distance between the two cys mutations is less in every case in the oxy hemoglobin structure than in the deoxy structure.

      The DNA sequences encoding the individual polypeptide chains may be of genomic, cDNA and synthetic origin, or a combination thereof.

      Since the genomic globin genes contains introns, genomic DNA must either be expressed in a host which can properly splice the premessenger RNA or modified by excising the introns.
      <br/>
      Use of an at least partially synthetic gene is preferable for several reasons.
      <br/>
      First, the codons encoding the desired amino acids may be selected with a view to providing unique or nearly unique restriction sites at convenient points in the sequence, thus facilitating rapid alteration of the sequence by cassette mutagenesis.
      <br/>
      Second, the codon selection may be made to optimize expression in a selected host.
      <br/>
      For codon preferences in E. coli, see Konigsberg, et al., PNAS, 80:687-91 (1983).
      <br/>
      Finally, secondary structures formed by the messenger RNA transcript may interfere with transcription or translation.
      <br/>
      If so, these secondary structures may be eliminated by altering the codon selections.

    <p num="234">
      While not required, it is desirable that the subunits, when expressed in bacteria, be co-expressed in the same cell, and it is still more preferable that they be co-expressed polycistronically.
      <br/>
      A polycistronic operon encodes a single messenger RNA transcript having one promoter sequence, but two or more pairs of start and stop codons that define distinctly translatable sequences.
      <br/>
      Each such sequence is known as a "cistron," and the polypeptides corresponding to the cistrons are thus co-expressed under the control of the single promoter.
    </p>
    <p num="235">
      The majority of bacterial operons are polycistronic, that is, several different genes are transcribed as a single message from their operons.
      <br/>
      Examples include the lactose operon with three linked genes. (lacZ, lacY and lacA) and the tryptophan operon with five associated genes (trpE, trpD, trpC, trpB, and trpA).
      <br/>
      In these operons, the synthesis of messenger RNA is initiated at the promoter and, within the transcript, coding regions are separated by intercistronic regions of various lengths. (An operon is a cluster of genes that is controlled as a single transcriptional genetic unit).

      Translational efficiency varies from cistron to cistron.

      When intercistronic regions are longer than the span of the ribosome (about 35 bases), dissociation at the stop codon of one cistron is followed by independent initiation at the next cistron.

      With shorter intercistronic regions, or with overlapping cistrons, the 30S subunit of a terminating ribosome may fail to dissociate from the polycistronic mRNA, being instantly attracted to the next translational initiation site.

      In one embodiment, expression of the genes encoding two or more component polypeptides are driven by a single promoter, and the genes are arranged so that a polycistronic messenger RNA transcript is transcribed, from which the separate globin-like polypeptides are subsequently translated.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention includes the co-expression of the different polypeptides from separate promoters, i.e., the host transcribes separate alpha and beta globin mRNAs.

    <p num="239">
      Ideally, alpha and beta globin-like domains are expressed in stoichiometrically equal amounts.
      <br/>
      While use of a single promoter does not guarantee equality, it eliminates one unbalancing influence--differences in transcription owing to differences in promoter strength is and accessibility.
      <br/>
      If differences in promoter strength were minimized by use of two identical promoters on the same plasmid, plasmid stability would be reduced as there would be a propensity toward recombination of the homologous regions.
    </p>
    <p num="240">
      Preferably, the alpha and beta globin-like domain-encoding genes are arranged so that the ribosome will translate the alpha globin cistrons first.
      <br/>
      The rationale is that there is some basis for believing that alpha globin affects the folding of beta globin.
      <br/>
      Nonetheless, the position of the genes may be switched so that a beta globin-like domain is synthesized first.
    </p>
    <p num="241">The stability of the polycistronic mRNA transcript, the efficacy of its translation into alpha and beta globin-like polypeptides, and the folding of the globin chains into tetrameric hemoglobin may be modified by varying the length and base sequence of the intercistronic regions (the region lying between the stop codon of one cistron and the start codon of the next cistron), the phasing of a second cistron relative to a first cistron, and the position and sequence of the ribosomal binding site for the one cistron relative to the preceding cistron.</p>
    <p num="242">
      In a preferred embodiment, the alpha and beta globin-like polypeptides genes are each preceded by a short "introductory" cistron or "ribosomal loader" which facilities the subsequent translation of the globin cistron.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, region A (FIGS. 2a through 2c) contains two cistrons and a Shine-Dalgarno sequence preceding each cistron.
      <br/>
      The first Shine-Dalgarno sequence (SD-1) is bound by the ribosome, which then translates the first cistron, a short cistron encoding an octapeptide. (This cistron is referred to as an "introductory cistron or ribosomal loader.) The second cistron is a globin gene, in this case, an FX alpha-globin gene.
      <br/>
      The Shine-Dalgarno sequence (SD-2) for facilitating translation of the second cistron actually lies within the first cistron.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the two are said to be "transitionally coupled".
      <br/>
      Region B (FIGS. 2c through 2e) is identical in structure, except that the second cistron encodes FX-beta globin.
      <br/>
      Between regions A and B is a 43-base intercistronic region (FIG. 2c).
      <br/>
      The introductory cistrons of regions A and B correspond to the first cistron of the two-cistron expression system denoted pCZ144 in Schoner, et al., Meth. Enzymol., 153: 401-16 (1987).
      <br/>
      The present invention is not, however, limited to the particular "starter" cistron taught by Schoner, et al.; other introductory cistrons that allow for restart of high level translation of a following cistron may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="243">
      Guidance as to the design of intercistronic sequences and as to the location of SD sequences may be obtained by comparing the translational efficiency of spontaneous or controlled mutants of the same polycistronic operon, as exemplified by Schoner, et al., PNAS, 83: 8506-10 (1980).
      <br/>
      It is also possible to look for consensus features in the intercistronic regions of different operons.
      <br/>
      McCarthy, et al., EMBO J., 4: 519-26 (1985) have identified a translation-enhancing intercistronic sequence in the E. coli atp operon.

      The present invention is intended to reduce or avoid the localization of the hemoglobin or its component polypeptides into inclusion bodies.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a further feature of the invention is that the functional hemoglobin is substantially found (preferably over 80%) in the soluble fraction of the cell.
      <br/>
      It appears that with this invention, over 90% of the functional hemoglobin can be so directed when alpha2 beta2 hemoglobin is assembled from alpha- and beta-globin chains co-expressed from a tetracistronic operon as described herein.
      <br/>
      With di-alpha, beta2 hemoglobin, nearly 100% is soluble when expression is induced at 25 (degree)  C. and less at higher induction temperatures.
      <br/>
      These percentages reflect the percent of all di-alpha and beta chains found in the soluble fraction of the cell and not actual recovery of protein from the cell.

      In another embodiment the present invention relates to the production of hemoglobin-like molecules in yeast.
      <br/>
      Our preferred host for expression in yeast is Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
      <br/>
      However, other fungi or yeast may be used for the purpose, such as strains of Aspergillus or Pichia.
      <br/>
      For yeast to be a suitable host it must be capable of being transformed with recombinant vectors, either replicating or integrating types.
      <br/>
      This allows the insertion of the desired DNA sequence for the gene of interest.
      <br/>
      It must also be capable of high density cell growth, in appropriate volume to provide sufficient cell mass to isolate the desired gene product from the desired reaction vessels, where ideally the growth would be easily controlled by several parameters including nutrient formulation, agitation and oxygen transfer and temperature.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to be able to induce the expression of protein synthesis with the manipulation of the media, temperature, or by the addition or consumption of certain chemicals.
      <br/>
      Finally, to be a suitable host, the yeast must be capable of producing recombinant proteins, preferably in excess of 1% of the total cell protein.
      <br/>
      This allows more facile isolation of the desired recombinant protein.
    </p>
    <p num="247">
      Either a haploid or a diploid strain of S. cerevisiae may be used.
      <br/>
      For example, the following diploid strains are preferred:
      <br/>
      BJY3505 x RSY330
      <br/>
      BJY3505 x BJY 1991
    </p>
    <p num="248">Other matings may likewise be used in practicing the present invention.</p>
    <p num="249">The use of protease-deficient strains may also be advantageous.</p>
    <p num="250">
      Yeast expression systems can be divided into two main categories: (1) Systems designed to secrete protein and (2) system designed for the cytoplasmic expression of proteins.
      <br/>
      At present, cytoplasmic expression is preferred since the yeast cells fold together the globin chains and incorporate heme to produce hemoglobin in vivo.
      <br/>
      However, it is possible to separately express and secrete the alpha and beta globin chains and assemble hemoglobin in vitro.
    </p>
    <p num="251">
      The globin genes must be placed under the control of a suitable promoter.
      <br/>
      The commonly used yeast promoters generally fall into two broad categories: regulated and constitutive.
      <br/>
      Constitutive promoters that are in wide use include GAP, PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase) and the  ALPHA -factor promoter.
      <br/>
      Regulated promoters have also been used and these include the yeast metallothionein promoter (regulated by copper), the Gal1-10 promoter, GAL7 promoter (regulated by galactose and glucose) the ADHII promoter (regulated by ethanol and glucose) the PH05 promoter (phosphate regulation) and several hybrid promoters such as PH05-GAP, GAL-PGK, ADHII-GAP, and GAL-CYC1.
    </p>
    <p num="252">
      The use of a GAL-GAP hybrid promoter is preferred.
      <br/>
      Both elements (the GALUAS and the GAP transcriptional initiation site) are well understood.
      <br/>
      Studies on the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the GAL regulon have been fairly extensive.
      <br/>
      The galactose regulon includes five genes that encode enzymes required for the utilization of galactose.
      <br/>
      Four of these genes (GAL1, GAL7, GAL10, and GAL2) are expressed only in the presence of galactose.
      <br/>
      Galactose induction does not occur in the presence of glucose unless the yeast strain bears a mutation in the REG1 gene.
      <br/>
      The GAL1, 7, 10 and 2 genes are regulated by at least two other genes, GAL80 and GAL4.
      <br/>
      The GAL4 gene is a transcriptional activator protein that activates mRNA synthesis from the GAL1, 7, 10 and 2 upstream activator sequences (UASGAL).
      <br/>
      Although GAL4 is constitutively expressed, it is functionally silent in the absence of galactose.
      <br/>
      Repression of GAL4 activity, in the absence of galactose is maintained by the product of the GAL80 gene.
      <br/>
      The GAL80 protein apparently interacts physically with GAL4 to prevent transcriptional activation.
      <br/>
      Presumably galactose or a galactose derivative prevents this interaction to allow GAL4 mediated induction.
    </p>
    <p num="253">
      Haploid strains of S. cerevisiae have three different genes encoding the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP).
      <br/>
      These genes have been designated TDH1, TDH2 and TDH3 and each is present as a single copy per haploid genome.
      <br/>
      The TDH3 gene produces approximately 60% of the cell's GAP enzyme and TDH1 and 2 produce about 12% and 28%, respectively (McAllister, L and M. J. Holland, 1985. J. Biol Chem, 260: 15019-15027).
      <br/>
      Holland's group (Holland et al. 1981. J. Biol Chem, 256:1385-1395; and Holland et al. 1983. J Biol Chem 258:5291-5299) has cloned and characterized the three GAP genes of S. cerevisiae.
      <br/>
      The clones have been designated pGAP11, pGAP63, and pGAP491. pGAP491 corresponds to the TDH3 gene and is therefore, the most highly expressed.
    </p>
    <p num="254">
      This promoter is commonly used as a 600-850 bp fragment and is essentially un-regulated.
      <br/>
      In its long form this is a very powerful promoter.
      <br/>
      The form we are using consists of only - 200 bp 5' of the translational initiation site.
      <br/>
      This form, with no added enhancer sequences is substantially less active than the longer form of the promoter (Edens, L. et al. Cell, 37:629 (1984)).
      <br/>
      Our addition of the GAL enhancer region confers both regulation and high levels of expression.
      <br/>
      With only the GAP491 promoter, alpha and beta globin were produced at a level of less than 0.2% total cell protein; with the GAL-GAP491 hybrid promoter, expression jumped to 7-10% total cell protein.
    </p>
    <p num="255">Several other hybrid promoters are of particular interest: GAL-SIGMA; SIGMA-GAP; GAL-EF III; SIGMA-EF III.</p>
    <p num="256">
      One could easily conceive of other promoter systems that would also work.
      <br/>
      This would include, but not be limited to, a variety of constitutive promoters.
      <br/>
      For example, the yeast mating factor ALPHA  (MF ALPHA ) promoter or the mating factor a promoter MF(a), the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGK), hexokinase1, hexokinase2, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, triose phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate isomerase, phosphoglycerate mutase, phosphofructose kinase or aldolase promoters may all be used.
      <br/>
      In short, any well expressed yeast promoter may work for expression of hemoglobin in yeast.
      <br/>
      A wide variety of naturally occurring, regulated promoters could also be used, for example: GAL1-10, GAL7, PHO5, ADHII have all been used to produce heterologous proteins in yeast.
      <br/>
      A variety of synthetic or semi-synthetic yeast promoters could also be employed such as GAL-PGK, GAL-MF ALPHA -1, GAL-MFa1, GAL-SIGMA.
      <br/>
      ADHII regulatory sequences could also be coupled to strong transcriptional initiation sites derived from a variety of promoters.
      <br/>
      The-PHO5 regulatory sequence or the sigma element regulatory sequences could also be used to construct powerful hybrid promoters.
      <br/>
      In addition to yeast promoters, it is conceivable that one could use a powerful prokaryotic promoter like the T7 promoter.
      <br/>
      In this case, one could place the T7 polymerase under the control of a tightly regulated yeast promoter.
      <br/>
      Induction of the phage polymerase in yeast cells bearing hemoglobin genes under T7 promoter regulation would allow transcription of the genes by this very efficient phage polymerase.
    </p>
    <p num="257">
      Because most of the yeast regulatory sequences described above serve as targets for proteins that are positive regulators of transcription, it is conceivable that these proteins may limit transcription in situations where the target sequence is present in many copies.
      <br/>
      Such a situation may obtain with vectors such as pC1B, pCIT, pC1U or pC1N which may be present in excess of 200 copies per cell.
      <br/>
      Over-expression of the positive regulator (for example GAL4) may result in enhanced expression.
      <br/>
      It is possible to construct a strain in which the GAL4 gene is altered to remove its promoter and the promoter replaced with the GAL7 or GAL1-10 promoters, both of which are transcribed more efficiently than the GAL4 promoter.
      <br/>
      In this situation, the positive transcriptional activator protein GAL4 would be expressed at elevated levels at the time hemoglobin expression was induced.

      The consensus sequence for higher eukaryotic ribosome binding sites has been defined by Kozack (Cell, 44:283-292 (1986)) to be: GAAG CCAUGG (SEQ ID NO:10).
      <br/>
      Deviations from this sequence, particularly at the -3 position (A or G), have a large effect on translation of a particular mRNA.
      <br/>
      Virtually all highly expressed mammalian genes use this sequence.
      <br/>
      Highly expressed yeast mRNAs, on the other hand, differ from this sequence and instead use the sequence AAAAAUGU (Cigan and Donahue, Gene, 59:1-18 (1987)).
      <br/>
      The ribosome binding site that we use for expression of the  ALPHA  and  BETA -globins corresponds to the higher eukaryotic ribosome binding site.
      <br/>
      It is within the contemplation of this invention to systematically alter this RBS to test the effects of changes that make it more closely resemble the RBS of yeast.
      <br/>
      It should be pointed out, however, that alterations at the -2, -1 and +3 positions, in general, have been-found to only slightly affect translational efficiency in yeast and in mammals.
    </p>
    <p num="259">
      Intracellular expression of genes in S. cerevisiae is primarily affected by the strength of the promoter associated with the gene, the plasmid copy number (for plasmid-borne genes), the transcription terminator, the host strain, and the codon preference pattern of the gene.
      <br/>
      When secretion of the gene- product is desired, the secretion leader sequence becomes significant.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that with multicopy plasmids, secretion efficiency may be reduced by strong promoter constructions.

      A variety of extrachromosomally replicating vectors (plasmids) are available for transforming yeast cells.
      <br/>
      The most useful multicopy extrachromosomal yeast vectors are shuttle vectors that use a full length 2 MU -circle combined with an E. coli plasmid.
      <br/>
      These vectors carry genes that allows one to maintain the plasmid in appropriate yeast mutants and antibiotic resistance markers that allow selection in E. coli.
      <br/>
      Use of the full-length 2 MU -circle, in contrast to vectors containing only a partial 2 MU  sequence; generally results in much higher plasmid stability, particularly in yeast strains that have been cured of endogenous 2 MU  plasmid.
      <br/>
      The pC series of vectors described herein are vectors of this type.
    </p>
    <p num="261">
      Strains could also be constructed in such a way that the GALGAP hemoglobin expression cassettes were integrated into chromosomes by using yeast integrating vectors.
      <br/>
      Although the copy number of the hemoglobin genes would be lower than for plasmid vectors, they would be quite stable and perhaps not require selection to be maintained in the host cell.
      <br/>
      Yeast integrating vectors include Yip5 (Struhl, et al, PNAS, 76:1035-39, 1989), Yip1 (Id.), and pGT6 (Tchumper and Carbon, Gene, 10:157-166, 1980).
      <br/>

    <p num="262">The genes encoding the desired globin-like domains may be introduced by separate plasmids, or both upon the same plasmid.</p>
    <p num="263">
      Highly expressed yeast genes show a very high codon bias.
      <br/>
      The genes encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ADH-I, for example, show a 90% bias for a set of 25 codons.
      <br/>
      Highly expressed yeast genes (&gt;1% of the total mRNA) have yeast codon bias indices of &gt;0.90. Moderately expressed genes (0.1-0.05% of the total mRNA) have bias indices of 0.6-0.8, and genes expressed at low levels (&gt;0.05% of the total cell protein) have a codon bias of 0.10-0.50(Bennetzen and Hall, J. Biol. Chem., 257:3026-3031 (1982)).
      <br/>
      The calculated value for the codons of the human  ALPHA -globin cDNA is 0.23. A similar value can be calculated for the  BETA -globin cDNA.
      <br/>
      Because there is a very high correlation between the most commonly used codons, it is possible that hemoglobin expression from the human cDNA in yeast may be limited by the availability of the appropriate tRNA molecules.
      <br/>
      If this is so, a complete synthesis of the gene using the most highly favored yeast codons could improve the expression levels.
      <br/>
      It is quite possible that the greatest negative effect of adverse codon use would be if there was an abundance of codons used in the cDNA that are represented by low abundance tRNAs.
      <br/>
      In such a case, high level expression of hemoglobin could completely drain that pool of tRNA molecules, reducing translation not only of hemoglobin but of yeast proteins that happen to use that codon as well.
      <br/>
      In the case of the  ALPHA -globin human cDNA, the most commonly used leucine codon is CTG (14 of 21), this codon is never used in highly expressed yeast genes (Guthrie and Abelson, The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces, Eds.

      Stratern, Jones and Broach, 1982.
      <br/>
      Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.).
      <br/>
      The low codon bias index and the presence of rare yeast codons in the globin cDNAs have been sufficient incentive for us to synthesize a modified form of the alpha- and beta-globin genes using the preferred yeast codons.

      A gene encoding a Met initiation codon, a Factor X site (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg)(SEQ ID NO:11), and human alpha globin, collectively referred to as FX-A, was synthesized and cloned into the XmaI/PstI sites of M13mp19.

      The product of the PCR amplification reaction can be blunt ended and cloned into the PuvII site of the expression plasmid.
      <br/>
      The PuvIl site is not reconstructed during this cloning step, so digestion with PuvII following ligation will linearize plasmids which do not incorporate the lacI sequence.
      <br/>
      Linearized plasmids will not transforms E. coli.
      <br/>
      Because the primers are complementary only to the translated portion of the lacI gene, this fragment does not contain its own promoter.
      <br/>
      Note that inducibility or expression of hemoglobin is dependent on the orientation of the lacI gene, thus orientation should be checked after insertion of the lacI gene.
      <br/>
      The correct orientation has a smaller EcoR5 fragment than the incorrect orientation.
      <br/>
      Moreover, insertion of the lacI repressor gene into the PuvII restriction site inactivates the rop gene product and results in increased plasmid copy number.
    </p>
    <p num="288">
      The final modification to the plasmid is restoration of a functional tetracycline resistance gene.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished by digestion of commercially available pBR322 with EcoRI followed by insertion via ligation of a synthetic DNA linker containing the 5' and 3' ends complementary to the EcoRI overhangs and an internal BamHI site.
      <br/>
      The BamHI fragment from this modified pBR322 vector containing the 5' coding sequence of the tetracycline resistance gene is purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, then inserted into the BamHI site of the modified pDL IV-8a plasmid.
      <br/>
      Only one orientation of the tetR fragment results in tetracycline resistance; strains can be screened for the proper orientation by growth on the appropriate medium.

    <p num="319">Hypothetical Protocol for the Construction of Hemoglobin Molecules Stabilized against Dimer Formation By Fusion Across the Alpha 1-Beta 2 or Alpha 2-Beta 1 Dimer Interface Region</p>
    <p num="320">
      The currently employed inter-dimer di-alpha fusion between the C terminus of one alpha subunit and the N terminus of the adjacent alpha subunit, represents a successful protein engineering approach to stabilizing hemoglobin against dimer formation.
      <br/>
      In this case, use was made of the fortunate juxtaposition of the two termini which originate from different diners.
      <br/>
      One might also make a di-beta polypeptide, as has been described, or a hemoglobin with both di-alpha and di-beta polypeptide, as has been described, or a hemoglobin with both di-alpha and di-beta linked subunits.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, one can envision other types of fusion in which the alpha subunit of one alpha/beta dimer is fused to the beta subunit of the other dimer (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      In this, two individual, linked polypeptides would dimerize to form the psuedo-tetrameric hemoglobin.
      <br/>
      This approach is based on the fact that dimerization involves specific, identical pairs of subunits, generally referred to as  ALPHA 1 BETA 1 and  ALPHA 2 BETA 2.
    </p>
    <p num="321">
      As an example of this alternative fusion approach, the alpha subunit C terminal residue (Arg 141) of dimer 1 could be fused, either directly or with an intervening fusion sequence, to the N-terminal amino acid of the beta subunit C helix (Tyr 35) of dimer 2.
      <br/>
      This would create a new C terminal residue at the end of the beta B helix (Val 34) and would leave a "free" piece of polypeptide comprised of the beta A and B helices (residues 1 to 34 inclusive).
      <br/>
      These alterations would give rise to a protein comprised of alpha subunit helices A through H fused to beta subunit helices C through H. The polypeptide composed of the beta subunit A and B helices would be covalently attached to the protein by introducing a new helix into the molecule.
      <br/>
      The helix would be designed to span the distance between the beta C terminus (His 146) and the original beta N terminus of helix A (Val 1).
      <br/>
      Following these changes, the sequence of helices from the N to C terminus of the new protein would be (alpha) A-B-C-E-F'-F-G-H-(beta)-C-D-E-F'-F-G-H-NEW-A-B.
      <br/>
      The actual arrangement of the fusion regions would require careful design so that new regions of structure did not extend into the dimer-dimer interface region which is critical to cooperativity.
      <br/>
      Introduction of amino acids containing basic or acidic residues into the molecule at certain positions could allow some restoration of functionally important salt bridges and hydrogen bonds which could be lost as a result of manipulating the normal N and C termini.
      <br/>
      The above approach could also extend to the production of the entire hemoglobin molecule or individual dimers as single polypeptide chains, although in the latter case this would not be expected to offer stabilization against diner formation.

      <br/>
      Absorbance readings at 568 and 558 nm are measured throughout the run for determination of percent oxyhemoglobin in the sample.
      <br/>
      Percent oxyhemoglobin is directly proportional to log A558 /log568 and is independent of path length.
      <br/>
      Both the absorbances and the oxygen pressure are sampled by a programmable-gain 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (Labmaster PGH, Scientific Solutions, Solon, Ohio) under computer control.
      <br/>
      The oxygen equilibrium curve is subjected to a low-pass digital filter.
      <br/>
      P50 values (partial pressure of O2 required for 50% saturation of oxygen binding sites) and Hill coefficients (n max) are calculated from the digitally filtered data by using software developed in our laboratory.
      <br/>
      The Hill coefficients are determined as the maximum slope of the functions dlog�y/(1-y)�/dlog p, where y is % O2 saturation and p is partial pressure of O2.

      P50 may also be measured under other conditions, but it should be noted that many environmental factors affect hemoglobin's oxygen affinity.
      <br/>
      The effect of pH CO2 inorganic unions, organic phosphates and temperature on P50 are discussed in Bunn and Forget, Hemoglobin: Molecular Genetic and Clinical Aspects 37-47, 95-98 (W. B. Saunders Co., 1986).,

    <p num="330">
      Since many determinations of whole blood oxygen binding curves are made under standard physiologic conditions (37 (degree)  C., pH, 7.4, pCO2 40 mm Hg), it may be necessary to adjust literature figures.
      <br/>
      In this context, it should be noted that a 10 (degree)  C. increase results in nearly a two-fold increase in P50, while the dependence of P50 on pH is approximately given as delta log P50 /delta pH=-0.5.

      Comparing P50 values of purified Hb preparations to P50 values of whole blood can be problematic.
      <br/>
      Whole blood or isolated RBC's contain many components that naturally modulate the shape of the hemoglobin-oxygen binding curve.
      <br/>
      The RBC encapsulates Hgb in the presence of a high concentration of the effector molecule 2,3-DPG, a molecule that causes Hgb to have a markedly lower affinity for O2.
      <br/>
      Other intra-erythrocyte components also affect the shape of the binding curve: ATP, Cl- CO2, H+, orthophosphate, methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin.
      <br/>
      The levels of these substances may vary with age, sex and condition.
      <br/>
      These substances are not normally present in purified Hgb solutions and thus, the P50 value of purified Hgb is lower than that found in whole blood.
      <br/>
      One very important modulator of Hgb-oxygen affinity is Cl- ion.
      <br/>
      Cl ion is found outside the erythrocyte in the blood serum at a physiologic concentration of approximately 0.15M. Since Cl- causes a lower O2 affinity, a Hgb solution with a P50 measured in vitro may well have much lower O2 affinity if infused into the blood stream.
      <br/>
      Another problem with measuring O2 binding of whole blood is that RBCs are quite fragile and in the process of manipulating the erythrocyte into the instrument used to measure the O2 binding it is inevitable that at least a small percentage of the RBCs will lyse.
      <br/>
      Lysed RBCs leak Hgb into the surrounding media away from 2,3-DPG; hence, since free Hgb has a higher affinity than intraerythrocyte Hgb, lysed RBCs will have a higher O2 affinity and can cause a falsely low P50 value for whole blood P50 determinations.
      <br/>
      It is widely accepted that under physiologic conditions while blood has a P50 value of 26-28 mm Hg.
      <br/>
      When Hgb is isolated from whole blood, however, the measured P50 is on the order of 1-10 mm Hg depending on the investigator's experimental conditions.
      <br/>
      For these reasons it is most accurate to measure Hgb-oxygen equilibria with purified Hgb molecules under strict conditions of buffer, pH and salt concentrations.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, there are no accepted "standards" for all investigators to measure Hgb oxygen binding for in vitro systems.
    </p>
    <p num="332">
      Still, as many mutant hemoglobins are first identified in patient's whole blood, one would like to be able to compare the relative affinities of native and mutant Hgb for O2, between whole blood and purified Hgb preparations.
      <br/>
      An example of this is Hgb Chico (beta lys66 -thr).
      <br/>
      If one examined only the P50 value of the purified mutant Hgb (10.1 mmHg) one would note that Hgb has a P50 value less than that for normal whole blood (27.2 mmHg).
      <br/>
      Still, when that hemoglobin is measured in RBCs under physiologic conditions it is apparent that it does have a higher P50 than normal whole blood (38 mmHg).
      <br/>
      One cannot predict the degree that the P50 value will change going from whole blood Chico to a purified Hgb Chico if it were infused into the bloodstream as a blood substitute.
      <br/>
      One can conclude however, that the P50 will be higher than it is in pure form, and that by reacting the mutant Hgb with organic phosphates that P50 will be even higher.
