      An optical system which is compact, lightweight and satisfactorily corrected for aberrations and may be suitably used as an imaging optical system or an ocular optical system for a head- or face-mounted image display apparatus which forms no intermediate image.
      <br/>
      The optical system includes an optical member (7) and a diffraction optical element (8), which are decentered with respect to each other.
      <br/>
      The optical member (7) has at least three adjacent optical surfaces, at least one of which is a curved surface.
      <br/>
      At least two reflections take place between the optical surfaces.
      <br/>
      The space between the optical surfaces is filled with a medium having a refractive index larger than 1.
      <br/>
      Light rays emitted from an image display device (6) enter the optical member (7) through a first transmitting surface (5) disposed to face the image display device (6) and are reflected by a first reflecting surface (3).
      <br/>
      The reflected light rays are reflected by a second reflecting surface (4) and led to an observer's eyeball through a second transmitting surface (3).

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a compact imaging optical system and ocular optical system which have favorable aberration correction performance, a wide field angle and high resolution.
      <br/>
      The present invention also relates to an image display apparatus which uses the ocular optical system.
    </p>
    <p num="3">In recent years, helmet- and goggle-type head- or face-mounted image display apparatuses have been developed for virtual reality or for the purpose of enabling the user to enjoy a wide-screen image personally.</p>
    <p num="4">
      For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open ( KOKAI) No. 2-297516 discloses an-image display apparatus including, as shown in FIG. 48, a two-dimensional display device 21 for displaying an image, an objective collimator lens 22, and a parallel transparent plate 23 having off-axis parabolic mirrors at both ends thereof.
      <br/>
      Display light emanating from the two-dimensional display device 21 is formed into parallel rays through the objective collimator lens 22.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the light rays are successively subjected to first transmission by one of the parallel surfaces of the parallel transparent plate 23, reflection by the first parabolic mirror, some total reflections in the parallel transparent plate 23, reflection by the second parabolic mirror and second transmission by the other of the parallel surfaces (a total of 8 reflections and a total of 2 transmissions), thereby forming an intermediate image at the point F and projecting the intermediate image into an observer's eyeball 24.
    </p>
    <p num="5">U.S. Pat. No. 4,026,641 discloses an image display apparatus in which, as shown in FIG. 49, an object image displayed by an image display device 25 is converted into a curved object image by a transfer optical element 26, and the object image is projected into an observer's eyeball by a toric reflecting surface 27.</p>
    <p num="6">In head-mounted image display apparatuses, it is important to lead an image of an image display device to an observer's eyeball without using a relay optical system and without forming an intermediate image in the optical path, as shown for example in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 6-308424.</p>
    <p num="7">
      However, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 6-308424, the optical path is formed with a half-mirror interposed therein.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a loss of light quantity, and it is not easy to perform bright display.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      European Patent No. 0,583,116A2 discloses a head-mounted image display apparatus which is capable of displaying a bright image without using a half-mirror.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, a relay optical system is used, which causes the size of the apparatus to increase unfavorably.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In an image display apparatus of the type in which an image of an image display device is relayed, as shown in FIG. 48, a relay optical system is needed in addition to an ocular optical system.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the entire optical system increases in both size and weight, and an amount by which the optical system projects from the observer's face or head also increases.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this type of image display apparatus is not suitable for use as a head- or face-mounted image display apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In the optical system that focuses parallel rays to form an intermediate image, and also in the optical system that projects an intermediate image into an observer's eyeball, only the parabolic mirror has power.
      <br/>
      Therefore, exceedingly large aberrations are produced in these optical systems.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      When a concave mirror alone is used as an ocular optical system as shown in FIG. 49, even if the concave mirror is a toric surface as in the case of FIG. 49, the ocular optical system produces exceedingly large aberrations, causing the image quality to be degraded.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is necessary to use a transfer optical element 26 such as a fiber plate for correcting field curvature produced by the ocular optical system.
      <br/>
      However, comatic and other aberrations cannot satisfactorily be corrected even if the transfer optical element 26 and the toric reflecting surface 27 are used.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      In view of the above-described problems of the conventional techniques, an object of the present invention is to provide an optical system of the type having at least three surfaces and in which a space formed by the at least three surfaces is filled with a medium having a refractive index larger than 1.
      <br/>
      The optical system according to the present invention is compact, lightweight and satisfactorily corrected for aberrations and may be suitably used as an imaging optical system or an ocular optical system and also for an image display apparatus which uses the ocular optical system.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      To attain the above-described object, the present invention provides an optical system having an optical member and a diffraction optical element which is adjacent to the optical member.
      <br/>
      The optical member has at least three adjacent optical surfaces which are decentered with respect to each other.
      <br/>
      At least one of the three optical surfaces is a curved surface, and the three optical surfaces are arranged such that at least two reflections take place between them.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In addition, the present invention provides an image display apparatus having an image display device for displaying an image, an ocular optical system for leading the image displayed by the image display device to an observer's eyeball without forming an intermediate real image, and a device for retaining both the image display device and the ocular optical system on an observer's head or face.
      <br/>
      The ocular optical system includes an optical member having a first surface disposed to face the image display device, a second surface disposed on an observer's visual axis to face an observer's pupil at a tilt to the observer's visual axis, and a third surface disposed on the observer's visual axis between the second surface and the observer's pupil.
      <br/>
      The second surface is a reflecting surface.
      <br/>
      Light rays emitted from the image display device enter the optical member through the first surface, and the light rays are reflected by the second surface and led to the observer's eyeball through the third surface.
      <br/>
      In addition, a correction optical element is disposed at a position between the image display device and the observer's pupil.
      <br/>
      The correction optical element produces aberrations which are opposite in sign to aberrations produced by the transmitting surfaces of the optical member.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In addition, the present invention provides an image display apparatus having an image display device for displaying an image, an ocular optical system for leading the image displayed by the image display device to an observer's eyeball without forming an intermediate real image, and a device for retaining both the image display device and the ocular optical system on an observer's head or face.
      <br/>
      A light-blocking member is provided between the ocular optical system and the observer's eyeball.

      <br/>
      A numerical aperture limiting member is disposed between the image display device and the ocular optical system to limit the numerical aperture of a bundle of light rays emitted from the image display device.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="23">First, the reason for adopting the above-described arrangements, together with the operations thereof, will be explained, and then, examples of the present invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="24">
      First, the operation of an optical system according to the present invention as it is used as an image display apparatus will be explained.
      <br/>
      The operation of the optical system as it is used as an imaging optical system is the same as that in the case of the image display apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="25">The present invention relates to an layout of an optical system which is needed in order to arrange the optical system in a compact form.</p>
    <p num="26">
      It is important to arrange the optical system in a thin form in order to reduce the overall thickness of the image display apparatus.
      <br/>
      As the image display apparatus is reduced in thickness the center of gravity comes close to the center of the observer's head.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the moment of inertia can be reduced even if the weight is the same.
      <br/>
      In other words, the capability of the apparatus to follow up the movement of the observer's head is markedly improved.
    </p>
    <p num="27">Accordingly, the present invention adopts an arrangement in which an image of an image display device is projected directly into an observer's eyeball without using a relay optical system.</p>
    <p num="28">To form a thin optical system, the system is arrangement such that light rays reciprocate in the optical system, and thus the optical path is folded, thereby succeeding in reducing the thickness of the optical system.</p>
    <p num="29">
      A wide observation field angle cannot be ensured simply by folding the optical path of the optical system.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is important to form at least one reflecting surface by a curved surface having a concave surface directed toward the pupil position of the optical system so that light rays are reflected and converged by the curved surface, and it is also important to arrange the optical system such that light rays are repeatedly reflected in the optical system.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The gist of the present invention resides in that a diffraction optical element (DOE) is used to correct even more satisfactorily aberrations remaining in the optical system arranged as described above.
      <br/>
      A diffraction optical element can refract light rays by diffraction action of a diffraction surface formed on a thin substrate.
      <br/>
      This is very important in producing a compact and lightweight optical system.
      <br/>
      That is, a diffraction optical element can be formed on a thin and lightweight substrate, whereas a refracting optical element of glass, i.e. an ordinary glass lens, is exceedingly heavy.
      <br/>
      Further, an aspherical surface action can also readily be imparted to a diffraction optical element by varying the diffraction grating pitch on the diffraction surface in the radial direction, although a high level of manufacturing technique is usually required to realize an aspherical surface action.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Further, it is important in order to correct coma and astigmatism produced by a decentered optical member that the diffraction optical element should also be decentered in the same plane as the decentration plane in which the optical member is decentered.
      <br/>
      The decentration of the diffraction optical element enables the coma and astigmatism to be corrected even more satisfactorily.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      It is preferable that at least two of the at least three optical surfaces should be disposed with their concave surfaces directed toward a stop (eyeball).
      <br/>
      The reason for this is that field curvature produced by a concave mirror can be corrected by forming an optical system from two reflecting surfaces, that is, one concave mirror having a concave surface directed toward the stop and one convex mirror having a concave surface directed toward the stop, with respect to light rays entering the optical system through the stop (light rays in backward ray tracing when the optical system is used in an image display apparatus).
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the decentered optical system does not fall under the category of conventional optical systems which are rotationally symmetric with respect to the optical axis; therefore, the above-described arrangement must be considered in terms of two directions, that is, the direction of the decentration plane in which the optical system is decentered, and the direction of a plane which perpendicularly intersects both the stop and the decentration plane.
      <br/>
      It is important to arrange the above-described positive and negative surfaces, i.e. concave and convex surfaces, with respect to either of the two directions in which residual aberrations are greater, or in which greater importance is attached to the aberration correction.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Further, it is preferable that the at least three adjacent optical surfaces should be at least three reflecting surfaces having different powers.
      <br/>
      By doing so, the power can be effectively distributed, and it becomes possible to project an image with smaller aberrations when the same power is to be obtained.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the term "optical surface" as used herein means a surface which intersects an optical axis.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      By filling a space formed by the above-described three surfaces with a medium having a refractive index larger than 1, it becomes possible to form reflecting surfaces by using back-coated mirrors, and thus the occurrence of comatic and spherical aberrations can be suppressed.
      <br/>
      This is because light rays in backward ray tracing from the pupil are convergently refracted after passing through the second transmitting surface, thereby making it possible to suppress divergence of light rays in the optical system more effectively than in the case of an optical system using surface-coated mirrors when the same observation field angle is to be ensured.
      <br/>
      Thus, it becomes possible to reduce aberrations produced by the reflecting surfaces.
      <br/>
      At the same time, no vignetting of light rays occurs, and it is possible to reduce the size of the optical system.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Light rays emitted from the image display device pass through the first transmitting surface to enter a transparent medium which has at least three surfaces and whose refractive index is larger than 1.
      <br/>
      The incident light rays are reflected twice between the first and second reflecting surfaces, whereby the optical path is folded.
      <br/>
      Then, the light rays pass through the second transmitting surface, which lies between the stop and the second reflecting surface, to exit from the transparent medium, and then pass through the stop.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, it is possible to form the first and second reflecting surfaces as back-coated mirrors.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it becomes possible to dispose concave and convex mirrors at an appropriate interval such that aberrations, i.e. field curvature and spherical aberration, produced by the reflecting surfaces of the concave and convex mirrors cancel each other.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to maintain favorable aberration conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      It is desirable to arrange the optical system such that an image displayed by the image display device is led to the observer's eyeball without forming an intermediate image on its way to the observer's eyeball.
      <br/>
      It is possible to provide a compact, lightweight and wide-field image display apparatus by placing the image display device at the image plane, disposing the observer's pupil at the stop position, and appropriately selecting various parameters of the optical system.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      One of the at least three optical surfaces is formed such that the curvature in the plane of decentration of the three surfaces is different from the curvature in a plane perpendicularly intersecting the decentration plane.
      <br/>
      By doing so, it becomes possible to correct astigmatism produced by the decentered concave mirror.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      When field angles in two directions, i.e. vertical and horizontal directions, are different from each other, aberration correction is different for the direction of narrower field angle than for the direction of wider field angle.
      <br/>
      Further, there is a difference in the way in which aberrations due to decentration occur between the decentration direction and a direction in which the optical surfaces are not decentered, and the target of aberration correction in the two planes differs according to each particular combination.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is important to form an arbitrary optical surface such that the curvatures in the two planes differ from each other.
      <br/>
      The arbitrary optical surface is determined according to circumstances under which the optical system is used.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Further, by making the curvature in the decentration plane different from the curvature in a plane perpendicularly intersecting the decentration plane, the aberration correcting load on the diffraction optical element is reduced, so that satisfactory aberration correction can be made even if the diffraction optical element is produced as a rotationally symmetric optical element.</p>
    <p num="40">
      If the first reflecting surface and the second transmitting surface are disposed at the same position and with the same configuration, the number of surface configurations necessary to machine in the production of the optical system reduces.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the production of the optical system is facilitated.
      <br/>
      Even if the effective area of the first reflecting surface and that of the second transmitting surface overlap each other, light rays can be properly reflected and transmitted, and it becomes possible to ensure a wide field angle.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Assuming that a light ray which emanates from the center of the display surface (display area) of the image display device and passes through the eyeball is defined as a principal ray, it is desirable for the second reflecting surface to be decentered with respect to the principal ray.
      <br/>
      If the second reflecting surface is tilted with respect to the principal ray, it is possible to dispose the image surface (display surface) at a position sideward of the stop (eyeball pupil position).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it becomes possible to reduce the amount by which the optical system projects from the stop in the optical axis direction.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The second reflecting surface is preferably disposed with a concave surface thereof directed toward the stop, and it is even more desirable for the second reflecting surface to be formed by a back-coated mirror.
      <br/>
      By doing so, the second reflecting surface becomes a reflecting surface having a relatively strong power in the optical system.
      <br/>
      Further, comatic aberration is minimized, and hence the coma correcting load imposed on another surface is minimized.
      <br/>
      Thus, favorable results can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Incidentally, diffraction optical elements have negative extremely strong dispersion characteristics (Abbe's number: -3.45), as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 4-214516, filed by the present applicant.
      <br/>
      Therefore, even a diffraction optical element of weak power can exhibit powerful chromatic aberration correction capability.
      <br/>
      If a reflecting mirror is used to form a surface having a principal refracting power in the above-described optical system, light rays can be refracted without producing chromatic aberration at all.
      <br/>
      However, chromatic aberration that is produced when light rays pass through the first and second transmitting surfaces cannot be corrected by the reflecting surface and remains uncorrected.
      <br/>
      To correct the chromatic aberration, the diffraction optical element is designed to produce chromatic aberration which corrects the chromatic aberration produced by the first and second transmitting surfaces, thereby enabling the optical system to be satisfactorily corrected for chromatic aberration as a whole.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to obtain a favorable image, which is corrected for chromatic aberration.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In a case where the first reflecting surface and the second transmitting surface, which are disposed at the same position and with the same configuration, are arranged to operate as a reflecting surface, the surface is disposed such that light rays are incident thereon at an angle greater than the critical angle; in a case where the first reflecting surface and the second transmitting surface are arranged to operate as a transmitting surface, the surface is disposed such that light rays are incident thereon at an angle smaller than the critical angle.
      <br/>
      By doing so, the loss of light quantity can be minimized, and it is possible to obtain an optical system that provides a bright image.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      If the diffraction optical element is disposed between the optical system and the stop (observer's eyeball pupil position), it is possible to increase the focal length of the diffraction optical element.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it becomes possible to effect aberration correction by a diffraction optical element which has a wide diffraction grating pitch and thus exhibits favorable productivity.
    </p>
    <p num="46">If the diffraction optical element is disposed between the optical system and the image surface (display surface), the effective area of the diffraction optical element can be minimized, and it becomes possible to effect aberration correction by a small-sized diffraction optical element.</p>

      If 1/f is not larger than the lower limit of the condition (1), i.e. -0.1, aberrations produced by the diffraction optical element become excessively small in comparison to aberrations produced by the rest of the optical system, resulting in under correction.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it becomes impossible to effect favorable aberration correction.
      <br/>
      If 1/f is not smaller than the upper limit, i.e. 0.1, aberrations produced by the diffraction optical element become excessively large, resulting in over correction with respect to aberrations produced by the rest of the optical system.

    <p num="79">Next, the reason for adopting the above-described arrangements in the image display apparatus according to the present invention, together with the operations thereof, will be explained.</p>
    <p num="80">
      In the optical system of the image display apparatus according to the present invention, a diffraction optical element (hereinafter referred to as "DOE"), represented by a Fresnel zone plate, or a gradient index lens is used to correct chromatic aberration, field curvature and other aberrations remaining uncorrected in a single decentered prism which has three or four optical surfaces and in which a space formed between these optical surfaces is filled with a medium having a refractive index larger than 1.
      <br/>
      The aberration correction capabilities of DOEs and gradient index lenses will be explained below.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      DOEs, represented by zone plates, have high reciprocal dispersion characteristics i.e. Abbe's number  GAMMA d =-3.45, and exhibit powerful chromatic aberration correction capability.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a DOE can effectively correct chromatic aberration remaining in a single decentered prism as a result of the achievement of high-density image display devices, as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Further, because a DOE having aspherical action can be produced by the same method as that for a DOE having spherical action, it is possible to positively give aspherical action to the DOE and hence possible to effectively correct off-axis aberration increased as a result of achievement of a wider field of view.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the DOE is given such aspherical action (pitch distribution) that the power becomes weaker than the power of a paraxial spherical system as the distance from the optical axis increases, the aberration correction capability increases.
      <br/>
      Further, with such pitch arrangement, the pitch at the periphery of the clear aperture region of the DOE becomes relatively large, so that the productivity of the DOE also improves.
      <br/>
      In addition, unlike a refracting lens, a DOE can be produced simply by forming a diffraction surface on the surface of a substrate.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is accompanied by practically no increase in volume or weight and hence favorable for use in an optical system of a head-mounted image display apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Noting that a gradient index lens is capable of correcting Petzval sum and chromatic aberration, the present invention uses a gradient index lens in combination with the above-described single decentered prism to correct chromatic aberration, field curvature and other aberrations remaining in the decentered prism.
      <br/>
      The Petzval sum and chromatic aberration correcting action of a gradient index lens will be explained below.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      A gradient index lens used in the present invention is of the radial type that has a refractive index distribution in a direction perpendicular to the optical axis.
      <br/>
      The refractive index distribution for the reference wavelength is expressed by
      <br/>
      n(r)=N0 +N1 r2 +N2 r4 +N3 r6 +  (9)
    </p>
    <p num="85">where N0 is the refractive index for the reference wavelength of the lens on the optical axis, r is the radial distance from the optical axis, n(r) is the refractive index for the reference wavelength at a position of distance r from the optical axis, and N1, N2, N3, . . . are 2nd-, 4th- and 6th-order coefficients of the reference wavelength, respectively.</p>
    <p num="86">
      First of all, the correction of Petzval sum will be explained.
      <br/>
      Among quantities that must be particularly noted at the stage of initially designing a lens system is Petzval sum, which is determined by power distribution.
      <br/>
      The Petzval sum of a homogeneous system may be expressed by
      <br/>
      .o slashed.s /N0   (10)
    </p>
    <p num="87">where .o slashed.s is the refracting power of the surface, and N0 is the refractive index of the lens on the optical axis.</p>
    <p num="88">
      The Petzval sum of a single gradient index lens may be expressed by
      <br/>
      .o slashed.s '/N0 +.o slashed.M N02   (11)
    </p>
    <p num="89">where .o slashed.s ' is the refracting power of the surface, and .o slashed.M is the refracting power of the medium.</p>
    <p num="90">As will be clear from the expression (11), a gradient index lens can correct Petzval sum because its medium has refracting power.</p>
    <p num="91">
      Next, the correction of chromatic aberration will be explained.
      <br/>
      In the case of a gradient index lens, a medium thereof also has capability of correcting chromatic aberration.
      <br/>
      The condition that must be satisfied by a single gradient index lens to correct axial chromatic aberration is as follows:
      <br/>
      .o slashed.s '/.nu.0d +.o slashed.M /.nu.1d =0   (12)
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Assuming the refractive indices of the lens on the optical axis for the d-line, F-line and C-line are N0d, N0F and N0C, respectively, .nu.0d is expressed by
      <br/>
      .nu.0d =(N0d -1)/(N0F -N0C)   (13)
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      From 2nd-order coefficients N1d, N1F and N1C in the refractive index distribution expression (9) for the d-line, F-line and C-line, .nu.1d is obtained as follows:
      <br/>
      .nu.1d =N1d /(N1F -N1C)   (14)
    </p>
    <p num="94">In other words, it is possible to correct chromatic aberration by varying the medium distribution configuration of a gradient index lens for each wavelength.</p>
    <p num="95">
      In the present invention, chromatic aberration, field curvature and other aberrations which remain in a decentered prism having three or four optical surfaces, as shown in FIGS. 14 to 20, are corrected by producing aberrations which are opposite in sign to the residual aberrations with a correction optical element comprising the above-described diffraction optical element or gradient index lens.
      <br/>
      Such a correction optical element may be disposed on either the observer's eyeball side or the image display device side of the decentered prism (optical member).

      As a technique of designing an optical system including a DOE, Sweatt model is known; this is detailed in W. C. Sweatt "NEW METHODS OF DESIGNING HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICAL ELEMENTS", SPIE, Vol. 126, pp. 46-53 (1977).
      <br/>

      According to the above-mentioned paper, the following equation holds:

      Therefore, the following equation holds from Eqs. (16) and (17):

      (nu -1)dz/dh=m LAMBDA /d   (18)

    <p num="118">
      That is, the equivalent relationship expressed by Eq. (18) is established between "the surface configuration of the refracting lens in which n&gt;&gt;1" and "the pitch of the DOE".

      Accordingly, the pitch distribution on the DOE can be obtained from the surface configuration of the ultra-high index lens designed on the basis of Sweatt model.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      More specifically, let us assume that the ultra-high index lens is designed as an aspherical lens defined by

      Thus, in the optical system according to the present invention, a DOE or a GRIN is used to correct chromatic aberration, field curvature and other aberrations remaining uncorrected in a single decentered prism which has three or four optical surfaces and in which a space formed between these optical surfaces is filled with a medium having a refractive index larger than 1.
      <br/>
      When the optical system is used as an ocular optical system, the arrangement is not necessarily limited to one that is designed for a single eye.

      If a pair of optical systems are used to enable observation with both eyes, it is possible for the observer to see the observation image without fatigue.

      Further, if images with a disparity therebetween are presented to both eyes, it is possible to view the observation image as a stereoscopic image.
      <br/>
      If a pair of ocular optical systems according to the present invention are used in combination with a mechanism for supporting them on the observer's head, it becomes possible for the observer to see the observation image in his/her own easy posture.

    <p num="220">
      Incidentally, the problem of flare or ghost light is associated with an image display apparatus that uses an ocular optical system 10 comprising, for example, a decentered prism which has two to four optical surfaces and in which a space formed by the optical surfaces is filled with a medium having a refractive index larger than 1, as described above.
      <br/>
      More specifically, light from the image display device 6 which does not participate in display may enter the observer's eyeball directly or by being irregularly reflected, thus forming flare light or ghost light.
      <br/>
      Further, external light may enter the observer's eyeball by being reflected by some surface of the ocular optical system 10, thus forming flare light or ghost light.
      <br/>
      Such flare or ghost light causes the displayed image quality to be degraded.
      <br/>
      This will be briefly explained below by taking the optical system shown in FIG. 14 as an example.
    </p>
    <p num="221">
      FIG. 44(a) shows an optical path of normal display light.
      <br/>
      In the case of the ocular optical system 10 shown in FIG. 14, display light from the image display device 6, e.g. an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), enters the ocular optical system 10 through the first surface 5 and is totally reflected by the fourth surface, which is formed by the third surface 3 serving as both transmitting and reflecting surfaces.
      <br/>
      The reflected light is then reflected by the second surface 4 and exits from the ocular optical system 10 through the third surface 3 to enter the observer's pupil 1, thereby allowing an image displayed by the image display device 6 to be viewed as an enlarged image.
      <br/>
      FIG. 44(b) shows an optical path of a first type of ghost light.
      <br/>
      A part of light from the image display device 6 enters the pupil 1 directly through the first surface 5 and fourth surface (third surface 3) of the ocular optical system 10 as ghost light, thus undesirably forming a ghost or other unwanted image outside the display area.
      <br/>
      FIG. 44(c) shows an optical path of a second type of ghost light.
      <br/>
      A part of light from the image display device 6 enters the ocular optical system 10 through the first surface 5 and is reflected by the fourth surface (third surface 3) so as to return to the first surface 5.
      <br/>
      The reflected light is reflected at the back of the first surface 5 and then enters the pupil 1 via the second surface 4 sand the third surface 3 as ghost light, as shown in the figure, thus similarly forming a ghost or other unwanted image outside the display area.
      <br/>
      FIG. 44(d) shows an optical path of a third type of ghost light.
      <br/>
      In this case, external light from the outside world is reflected by some surface (the second surface 4 in the case of the illustrated example) constituting the ocular optical system 10 so as to enter the pupil 1 as flare or ghost light, causing the displayed image quality to be degraded.
    </p>
    <p num="222">
      FIGS. 24(a) to 24(d) are views for explanation of optical paths in an image display apparatus according to Example 14 of the present invention, which correspond to FIGS. 44(a) to 44(d).
      <br/>
      That is, FIG. 24(a) shows an optical path of normal display light, and FIGS. 24(b), 24(c) and 24(d) show optical paths of the first, second and third types of ghost light, respectively.
      <br/>
      Although the ocular optical system 10 shown in FIG. 14 is used in this example, the same is true of the ocular optical systems 10 shown in FIGS. 15 to 20. In this example, a light-blocking plate 31 of light absorption properties, which is provided with a horizontally elongate rectangular aperture 32, is disposed between the ocular optical system 10 and the observer's pupil 1, thereby preventing flare or ghost light from entering the pupil 1.
    </p>
    <p num="223">
      More specifically, in the case of normal display light in FIG. 24(a), display light from the image display device 6, e.g. an LCD, enters the ocular optical system 10 through the first surface 5 and is totally reflected by the fourth surface, which is formed by the third surface 3 serving as both transmitting and reflecting surfaces.
      <br/>
      Then, the reflected light is reflected by the second surface 4 and exits from the ocular optical system 10 through the third surface 3 to enter the observer's pupil 1 through the aperture 32 without being blocked by the light-blocking plate 31, thus enabling an image displayed by the image display device 6 to be viewed as an enlarged image.
      <br/>
      In the case of the first type of ghost light shown in FIG. 24(b), light from the image display device 6 passes directly through the first surface 5 and fourth surface (third surface 3) of the ocular optical system 10, but it is prevented from entering the pupil 1 by the light-blocking plate 31 because the angle of incidence on the pupil 1 is larger than the field angle of the display area.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, no ghost light is introduced.
      <br/>
      In the case of the second type of ghost light shown in FIG. 24(c), light from the image display device 6 enters the ocular optical system 10 through the first surface 5 to reach the fourth surface (the third surface 3).
      <br/>
      The light is reflected by the fourth surface to return to the first surface 5 and then reflected at the back of the first surface 5 so as to exit from the ocular optical system 10 via the second surface 4 and the third surface 3, as shown in the figure.
      <br/>
      In this case also, the light is prevented from entering the pupil 1 by the light-blocking plate 31 because the angle of incidence on the pupil 1 is larger than the field angle of the display area.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, no ghost light is introduced.
      <br/>
      The third type of ghost light shown in FIG. 24(d) is external light from the outside world.
      <br/>
      Such external light is blocked by the light-blocking plate 31 of light absorption properties and cannot enter the ocular optical system 10.
      <br/>
      Therefore, no external light is reflected by any surface of the ocular optical system 10.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, neither flare nor ghost light is produced.
    </p>
    <p num="224">Thus, by disposing the light-blocking plate 31 having the aperture 32 between the ocular optical system 10 and the observer's pupil 1, it is possible to block flare and ghost light without intercepting display light from the image display device 6, and hence possible to effectively prevent degradation of the displayed image quality due to flare or ghost light based on light from the image display device 6 and light from the outside world.</p>
    <p num="225">
      Let us discuss the size of the aperture 32 in the light-blocking plate 31 that enables flare and ghost light to be effectively blocked.
      <br/>
      With a view to effectively blocking the three types of flare and ghost light, shown in FIGS. 44(a) to 44(d) without eclipsing normal display light, it is desirable to satisfy the following condition:
      <br/>
      L tan  THETA +.o slashed./2 &lt;= R &lt;= 2 (L tan  THETA +.o slashed./2)   (22)
    </p>
    <p num="226">where, as shown in FIG. 25, R is the distance from the edge of the aperture 32 in the light-blocking plate 31 to the visual axis 2 in a section containing the center of the image display device 6 and the visual axis 2, .o slashed. is the diameter of the exit pupil of the ocular optical system 10, L is the eye relief of the ocular optical system 10, and  THETA  is the half view angle in the section containing the center of the image display device 6 and the visual axis 2.</p>
    <p num="227">
      It is more desirable to satisfy the following condition:
      <br/>
      L tan  THETA +.o slashed./2 &lt;= R &lt;= 1.2 (L tan  THETA +.o slashed./2)   (22')
    </p>
    <p num="228">

      It should be noted that the above-described first to sixth surfaces may be formed from plane surfaces, spherical surfaces, aspherical surfaces, anamorphic surfaces, or anamorphic aspherical surfaces.

      At least one of the surfaces has positive power.
      <br/>
      Reflection at a surface which serves as both transmitting and reflecting surfaces, e.g. a surface constituting both the third and fourth surfaces in FIG. 14, may be total reflection, or effected by a back-coated mirror in a case where transmitting and reflecting regions are separated from each other.

      It should be noted that the light-blocking plate 31 may be provided in close contact with the pupil-side surface of the ocular optical system 10 by coating or other similar method.

      FIGS. 38(a) to 38(d) are views corresponding to FIGS. 24(a) to 24(d).
      <br/>
      In these figures, the light-blocking plate 31 having the aperture 32 is so shaped as to conform to the pupil-side surface (i.e. the third surface 3 in these figures) of the ocular optical system 10 and stuck fast to that surface.
      <br/>
      Operations taking place in FIGS. 38(a) to 38(d) are the same as those in FIGS. 24(a) to 24(d); therefore, description thereof is omitted.
      <br/>
      The same is true of the ocular optical systems 10 shown in FIGS. 26 to 37. However, if the light-blocking plate 31 is placed in close contact with a surface of the ocular optical system 10 in a case where total reflection at that surface is used, the conditions for the total reflection at the surface are destroyed by the close contact of the light-blocking plate 31.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is necessary to provide reflective coating on that surface and to bring the light-blocking plate 31 into close contact with the coating.

    <p num="239">
      Incidentally, ghost light, particularly one such as that shown in FIG. 44(b), occurs because the angle of divergence of display light from the image display device 6 (i.e. NA: numerical aperture) is excessively large.
      <br/>
      Assuming that the focal length of the ocular optical system 10 is, for example, 30 mm, and the diameter of the observer's pupil 1, that is, the exit pupil diameter of the ocular optical system 10, is 4 mm, and that the ocular optical system 10 is approximately telecentric on the image display device side, the angle of divergence of necessary light rays, which enter the observer's pupil 1, is 3.8 (degree)  according to a general formula for NA.
      <br/>
      In other words, among light rays emitted from the image display device 6, those which are at 3.8 (degree)  or more with respect to the normal to the image display device 6 have no effect on the image for observation and; rather, they are unwanted light rays and may cause flare or ghost.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, flare light and ghost light can also be reduced by limiting the NA of display light emitted from the image display device 6.
      <br/>
      To limit the NA of display light, as shown in FIG. 39, an NA limiting member 33, e.g. a louver, is disposed between the image display device 6 and the ocular optical system 10.
      <br/>
      A louver is a preferred example of the NA limiting member 33.
      <br/>
      As shown in the sectional view of FIG. 41, a louver 35 comprises light-transmitting openings 36 and light-blocking (light-absorbing) walls 37, which are alternately arranged in a one- or two-dimensional periodic pattern.
      <br/>
      The louver 35 selectively transmits only light in the range of a narrow angle  BETA  in a specific direction.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the louver 35 is disposed between the image display device 6 and the ocular optical system 10, display light emitted from the image display device 6 at a wide divergence angle  ALPHA  is limited to the narrow angle  BETA .
      <br/>
      Thus, light emitted from the image display device 6 at a large exit angle, which may cause ghost light, is cut off.
      <br/>
      Another example of the NA limiting member 33 is an optical fiber plate.
      <br/>
      The operation of the optical fiber plate is the same as that of the louver 35.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to use a field selecting glass as the NA limiting member 33.
      <br/>
      One example of field selecting glass is known as "Angle 21" (trade name; manufactured by Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd.), which transmits light entering it at a small incident angle, but scatters light incident thereon at a large angle, thereby preventing it from passing therethrough.
    </p>
    <p num="240">
      It is desirable for the NA limiting member 33 to limit the NA such that the angle  THETA  between the normal to the image display device 6 and a light ray extending at the largest divergence angle on the observer's pupil side satisfies the following condition:
      <br/>
      THETA &lt;45 (degree)   (23)
    </p>
    <p num="241">
      It is more desirable to satisfy the following condition:
      <br/>
      THETA &lt;20 (degree)   (23')

    <p num="242">
      FIG. 40 shows another arrangement for limiting the NA of display light emitted from the image display device 6.
      <br/>
      As shown in the figure, when an LCD 6' is used as the image display device 6, an NA limiting member 33 such as that described above is disposed between the LCD 6' and an illuminating light source 34 therefor.
      <br/>
      In this case also, display light from the image display device 6 is limited to a narrow angle, and there is no light emanating from the image display device 6 at a large exit angle at which ghost light may be produced.
    </p>
    <p num="243">It should be noted that, in the arrangements shown in FIGS. 39 and 40, the angle range of a bundle of transmitted light rays limited by the NA limiting member 33 need not always be symmetric with respect to the normal to the image display device 6 or 6'. There are cases where it is preferable to limit the NA of a ray bundle more at a side opposite to the observer �see FIGS. 43(a) and 43(b)�. In such a case, the principal ray of the transmitted ray bundle shifts from the normal to the image display device 6 or 6'.</p>
    <p num="244">
      When the LCD 6' is used as the image display device 6 in any of the ocular optical systems 10 shown in FIGS. 25 to 37, it is possible to limit the NA of display light entering the ocular optical system 10 so as to prevent occurrence of flare or ghost light by properly selecting the relative position of the LCD 6' and the illuminating light source 34.
      <br/>
      This scheme will be explained below.
    </p>
    <p num="245">
      As shown in FIGS. 42(a) to 42(c), the distance between the display surface of the image display device 6 and the illuminating light source 34 is defined as d, and the angle between the normal to the image display device 6 and an imaginary' straight line connecting an end point on the light-emitting surface of the illuminating light source 34 and the corresponding end point on the display surface is defined as  THETA .
      <br/>
      As the illuminating light source 34 is moved away from the image display device 6 such that the distance d changes to be d0 &lt;d1 &lt;d2 �FIGS. 42(a) --&gt; 42(b) --&gt; 42(c)�, the incident angle  THETA  of light rays from the illuminating light source 34 at the edge of the image display area changes to be  THETA 0 &gt; THETA 1 &gt; THETA 2.
      <br/>
      That is, as the distance d between the display surface of the image display device 6 and the illuminating light source 34 increases (d0 --&gt; d1 --&gt; d2), the incident angle  THETA  of light rays from the illuminating light source 34 at the edge of the image display area decreases ( THETA 0 THETA 1 --&gt;  THETA 2).
    </p>
    <p num="246">
      Accordingly, it is desirable that the distance d between the display surface of the image display device 6 and the illuminating light source 34 should satisfy the following condition:
      <br/>
      Sb&gt;d&gt;1 mm   (24)
    </p>
    <p num="247">where Sb is the length of the illuminating light source 34.</p>
    <p num="248">
      By setting the distance between the display surface of the image display device 6 and the illuminating light source 34 at 1 mm or more, the incident angle of light rays from the illuminating light source 34 at the edge of the image display area, that is, the incident angle at which the light rays enter the ocular optical system 10, becomes satisfactorily small, as shown in FIGS. 42(a) to 42(c).
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to reduce unwanted light which causes flare or ghost.
    </p>
    <p num="249">
      It will be apparent that the above-described purpose can be attained by combining the following conditions.
      <br/>
      That is, it is preferable to satisfy the following condition:
      <br/>
      Sb&gt;d&gt;2 mm   (24')
    </p>
    <p num="250">If the distance d between the display surface of the image display device 6 and the illuminating light source 34 is 2 mm or more, the incident angle  THETA  of light rays from the illuminating light source 34 at the edge of the image display area becomes smaller, and unwanted light can be further reduced.</p>
    <p num="251">
      It is more desirable to satisfy the following condition:
      <br/>
      Sb&gt;d&gt;3 mm   (24")
    </p>
    <p num="252">
      If the condition (24") is satisfied, the incident angle  THETA  of light rays from the illuminating light source 34 at the edge of the image display area becomes further smaller, and unwanted light can be reduced even more effectively.
      <br/>
      However, because the quantity of light from the illuminating light source 34 reduces, it is preferable to determine an optimum value by trial and error.
    </p>
    <p num="253">
      Ghost light such as that shown in FIG. 44(b) is caused by light rays of large NA emanating from a position on the display surface of the image display device 6 which is more away from the position of the observer's pupil 1.
      <br/>
      Incidentally, assuming that, as shown in FIGS. 43(a) and 43(b), the distance between one end of the illuminating light source 34 and the corresponding end of the image display device 6 is ds, if the illuminating light source 34 is tilted such that ds1 &lt;ds2 as shown in FIGS. 43(a) --&gt; 43(b), the incident angle of light rays from the illuminating light source 34 at the edge of the image display area is  THETA s1 &gt; THETA s2.
      <br/>
      In other words, as the distance d between the illuminating light source 34 and the image display device 6 increases (ds1 --&gt; ds2), the incidence angle  THETA  of light rays from the illuminating light source 34 at the edge of the image display area decreases ( THETA 1 --&gt;  THETA s2).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is desirable to tilt the illuminating light source 34 and the image display device 6 relative to each other such that the illuminating light source 34 and the image display device 6 diverge from each other at ends thereof which are remote from the observer's pupil 1, and that the tilt angle satisfies the following condition:
      <br/>
      Sb&gt;ds &gt;1 mm   (25)
    </p>
    <p num="254">where ds is the distance between the illuminating light source 34 and the display surface of the image display device 6 at their respective ends where the illuminating light source 34 and the image display device 6 diverge from each other.</p>
    <p num="255">
      By tilting the illuminating light source 34 and the image display device 6 relative to each other such that the illuminating light source 34 and the image display device 6 diverge from each other at ends thereof which are remote from the observer's eyeball, and that the tilt angle satisfies the condition (25), the inclination angle  THETA s of light rays emanating from the edge of the image display area is reduced, as shown in FIG. 43(b).
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to reduce unwanted light such as that shown in FIG. 44(b).
    </p>
    <p num="256">
      It is more desirable to satisfy the following condition:
      <br/>
      Sb&gt;ds &gt;2 mm   (25')
    </p>
    <p num="257">By tilting the illuminating light source 34 and the image display device 6 relative to each other such that the distance between the illuminating light source 34 and the display surface of the image display device 6 at the diverging ends is 2 mm or more, the inclination angle  THETA s of light rays emanating from the edge of the image display area is further reduced, and unwanted light can be further reduced.</p>
    <p num="258">
      It is still more desirable to satisfy the following condition:

      Sb&gt;ds &gt;3 mm   (25")

      It is possible to form a portable image display apparatus, such as a stationary or head-mounted image display apparatus, which enables the observer to see with both eyes by preparing a pair of combinations of an optical system according to the present invention, used as an ocular optical system, and an image display device for the left and right eyes, and supporting them apart from each other by the distance between the eyes.
      <br/>
      FIG. 45 shows the whole arrangement of an example of such a portable image display apparatus.
      <br/>
      A display apparatus body unit 50 contains a pair of left and right ocular optical systems such as those described above, and image display devices comprising liquid crystal display devices are disposed at the respective image planes of the two ocular optical systems.
      <br/>
      The apparatus body unit 50 is provided with a pair of left and right temporal frames 51 which are contiguous with the left and right ends of the apparatus body unit 50, as illustrated in the figure.
      <br/>
      The two temporal frames 51 are connected by a top frame 52.
      <br/>
      In addition, a rear frame 54 is attached to the intermediate portion of each temporal frame 51 through a leaf spring 53.
      <br/>
      Thus, by applying the rear frames 54 to the rear portions of the observer's ears like the temples of a pair of glasses and placing the top frame 52 on the top of the observer's head, the display apparatus body unit 50 can be held in front of the observer's eyes.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that a top pad 55, which is an elastic material such as a sponge, is attached to the inner side of the top frame 52, and a similar pad is attached to the inner side of each rear frame 54, thereby allowing the user to wear the display apparatus on his or her head without feeling uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p num="261">
      Further, a speaker 56 is provided on each rear frame 54 to enable the user to enjoy listening to stereophonic sound in addition to image observation.
      <br/>
      The display apparatus body unit 50 having the speakers 56 is connected with a reproducing unit 58, e.g. a portable video cassette unit, through an image and sound transmitting cord 57.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the user can enjoy not only observing an image but also listening to sound with the reproducing unit 58 retained on a desired position, e.g. a belt, as illustrated in the figure.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 59 in the figure denotes a switch and volume control part of the reproducing unit 58.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the top frame 52 contains electronic parts such as image and sound processing circuits.
    </p>
    <p num="262">
      The cord 57 may have a jack and plug arrangement attached to the distal end thereof so that the cord 57 can be detachably connected to an existing video deck.
      <br/>
      The cord 57 may also be connected to a TV signal receiving tuner so as to enable the user to enjoy watching TV.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the cord 57 may be connected to a computer to receive computer graphic images or message images or the like from the computer.
      <br/>
      To eliminate the bothersome cord, the image display apparatus may be arranged to receive external radio signals through an antenna connected thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="263">
      Further, the optical system according to the present invention can be used as an imaging optical system.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in the perspective view of FIG. 46, the optical system may be used in a finder optical system Fi of a compact camera Ca in which a photographic optical system Ob and the finder optical system Fi are provided separately in parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      FIG. 47 shows the arrangement of an optical system in a case where the present invention is used as such an imaging optical system.
      <br/>
      As illustrated, the optical system DS according to the present invention is disposed behind a front lens group GF and an aperture diaphragm D, thereby constituting an objective optical system Lt.
      <br/>
      An image that is formed by the objective optical system Lt is erected by a Porro prism P, in which there are four reflections, provided at the observer side of the objective optical system Lt, thereby enabling an erect image to be observed through an ocular lens Oc.
    </p>
    <p num="264">Although the optical system according to the present invention, together with the image display apparatus using the optical system as an ocular optical system, has been described above by way of examples, it should be noted that the present invention is not necessarily limited to these examples, and that various modifications may be imparted thereto.</p>
    <p num="265">As will be clear from the foregoing description, the optical system according to the present invention makes it possible to provide an imaging optical system which is compact and lightweight and favorably corrected for aberrations, and an optical system suitable for use as an ocular optical system for a head- or face-mounted image display apparatus.</p>
    <p num="266">
      Further, the image display apparatus according to the present invention is arranged such that chromatic aberration, field curvature, etc. which are produced by transmitting surfaces of a single decentered prism which has three or four optical surfaces and in which a space formed between these optical surfaces is filled with a medium having a refractive index larger than 1 are corrected by disposing a correction optical element at a position between the image display device and the observer's pupil such that the correction optical member produces aberrations opposite in sign to aberrations produced by the transmitting surfaces of the decentered prism.
      <br/>
      As the correction optical element, a DOE or a gradient index lens, which are useful for correction of the above-described aberrations, is used, thereby enabling residual aberrations, particularly chromatic aberration, to be satisfactorily corrected even when the pixel density of the image display device increases.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to obtain a head- or face-mounted image display apparatus which has a compact size and a wide field angle and is capable of displaying a clear image over the entire image field.
