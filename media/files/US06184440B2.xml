      The present invention discloses genetically engineered plants which display altered structure or morphology.
      <br/>
      The transgenic plants express a cell wall modulation transgene or gene construct that results in the altered structure or morphology.
      <br/>
      The altered structure or Morphology can be associated with, for example, altered biomass, growth, yield, greater or less resistance to biodegradation, more or less digestible to ruminants, altered cellulose content, larger leaves/normal hypocotyls or smaller leaves/longer hypocotyls, etc. compared to a non-transgenic plant of the same species.
      <br/>
      The cell wall modulation transgene can be any cellulose binding domain, a cellulose binding protein, or a cell wall modifying protein or enzyme such as endoxyloglucan transferase, xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase, an expansin, cellulose synthase, or a novel isolated endo-1,4-beta-glucanase of Arabidopsis thaliana.
      <br/>
      The invention also discloses transgenic plants containing a gene construct comprising a promoter operably linked to the cell wall modulation protein or polypeptide gene and may further comprise a sequence encoding a secretion signal peptide.
      <br/>
      In particular, the invention discloses transgenic plants containing a gene construct comprising the cel1 promoter, operably linked to the cel1 signal peptide and any cellulose binding domain.
      <br/>
      Methods for modulating plant growth by transgenic expression of a cell wall modulating protein or polypeptide are also disclosed.
      <br/>
      The present invention also discloses a novel, isolated Arabidopsis thaliana endo-1,4-beta-glucanase gene (cel1), its promoter (cel1 promoter) and polypeptide (Cel1) and recombinant nucleic acid vectors containing the cel1 gene with or without a secretion signal peptide sequence and/or the cel1 promoter.

    <p num="1">1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates generally to plants genetically engineered to display altered structure or morphology.
      <br/>
      The altered structure or morphology can be associated, for example, with greater biomass, yield, or growth, or larger plants or smaller plants.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to transgenic plants expressing a cell wall modulation transgene or gene construct that results in a transgenic plant having altered structure or morphology.
      <br/>
      The cell wall modulation transgene is a gene encoding a cellulose binding protein, a cellulose binding domain or a cell wall modifying protein or enzyme.
      <br/>
      The invention further relates to transgenic plants having altered structure or morphology expressing a transgene such as a gene encoding an endo-xyloglucan transferase, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, cellulose synthase or a novel isolated endo-1,4- BETA -glucanase.
      <br/>
      The invention also relates to transgenic plants containing a gene construct encoding a secretion signal peptide with a cell wall modulation protein or polypeptide controlled by a constitutive or tissue specific promoter.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the tissue specific promoter is a novel elongating tissue specific promoter of Arabidopsis thaliana, i.e., the cel1 promoter.
      <br/>
      The invention also relates to a novel isolated endoglucanase gene, i.e., the Arabidopsis thaliana endo-1,4- BETA -glucanase gene (cel1), its promoter (cel1 promoter) and its encoded polypeptide (Cel1) and recombinant vectors containing the cel1 gene with or without a secretion signal peptide sequence and/or the cel1 promoter.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="4">2.1. PLANT ELONGATION AND GROWTH</p>
    <p num="5">
      The plant cell elongation mechanism is a fundamental process with primary importance in plant-tissue development.
      <br/>
      Cell elongation requires relaxation of the rigid primary cell wall (Carpita and Gibeaut, 1993, Plant J. 3:1-30; Cosgrove, 1993, Plant Physiol. 102:1-6; Fry, 1988, The Growing Plant Cell Wall Chemical and Metabolic Analysis, Lonoman Scientific &amp; Technical, New York; Roberts, 1994, Curr.
      <br/>
      Opin. Cell Biol. 6:688-694).
      <br/>
      Several mechanisms for this relaxation have been suggested, including the activities of endo-xyloglucan transferase (Nishitani and Tominaga, 1992, J. Biol. Chem. 267:21058-21064), xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (Fry et al., 1992, Biochem. J. 282:821-828) and expansins (McQueen-Mason and Cosgrove, 1995, Plant Physiol. 107:87-100).
      <br/>
      Endo-1,4- BETA -glucanase (hereinafter, EGase) has been suggested to play an important role in the elongation process (Shoseyov and Dekel-Reichenbach, 1992, Acta Hort. 329:225-227; Verma et al., 1975, J. Biol. Chem.250:1019-1026).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Substantial evidence for the involvement of a 1,3-1,4- BETA -glucan-specific enzyme in cell elongation was found in monocotyledons (Hatfield and Nevins, 1987, Plant Physiol. 83:203-207; Hoson and Nevins, 1989, Plant Physiol. 90:1353-1358 1989; Inouhe and Nevins, 1991, Plant Physiol. 96:426-431).
      <br/>
      EGase has been implicated in xyloglucan degradation during vegetative growth and fruit ripening (Hayashi, 1989, Ann.
      <br/>
      Rev. Plant Physiol. 40:139-168; Hayashi et al., 1984, Plant Physiol. 25:605-610).
      <br/>
      The activity of this enzyme could affect the generation of oligosaccharins, signaling molecules that are involved, among other things, in plant development and cell elongation (see for review, Darvill et al., 1992, Glycobiology 2:181-198).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      To date, most of the EGase genes isolated have been studied in relation to fruit ripening (Cass et al., 1990, Mol. Gen. Genet. 223:76-86; Fischer and Bennett, 1991, Ann.
      <br/>
      Rev. Plant Physiol.
      <br/>
      Plant Mol. Biol. 42:675-703; Lashbrook et al., 1994, Plant Cell 6:1485-1493; Tucker et al., 1987, Plant Mol.
      <br/>
      Biol. 9:197-203) and abscission zones (Kemmerer and Tucker, 1994, Plant Physiol. 104:557-562; Tucker and Milligan, 1991, Plant Physiol. 95:928-933; Tucker et al., 1988, Plant Physiol. 88:1257-1262).
    </p>
    <p num="8">More recently, Wu et al. (1996, Plant Physiol. 110:163-170) cloned the EGase gene from pea and showed its expression to be induced by auxin in elongating epicotyls.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Endogenous regulation of cell elongation appears to be dominated by cell wall mechanics.
      <br/>
      This process is a result of the interaction between internal turgor pressure and the mechanical strength of the cell wall (reviewed by Steer and Steer, 1989, New Phytol. 111:323-358).
      <br/>
      Unlike most plant cells, the growth of pollen tubes and root hairs is restricted to the tip zone (reviewed by Cresti and Tiezzi, 1992, "Pollen tube emission organization and tip growth," in Sexual Plant Reproduction, pp. 89-97, eds.
      <br/>
      Cresti and Tiezzi, Springer-Verlag, Berlin).
      <br/>
      The growing region of pollen tubes consists of two distinct layers when fully mature.
      <br/>
      The inner layer consists mostly of callose-related molecules and the outer layer contains pectin, xyloglucan (XG), cellulose (at low levels and poor crystallinity) and other polysaccharides (reviewed by Steer and Steer, 1989, New Phytol. 111:323-358).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Xyloglucans (XGs) are linear chains of  BETA -(1-4)-D-glucan, but unlike cellulose, they possess numerous xylosyl units added at regular sites to the 0-6 position of the glucosyl units of the chain (reviewed by Carpita and Gibeaut, 1993, Plant J. 3:1-30).
      <br/>
      XG can be extracted by alkaline treatment and then bound again in vitro to cellulose (Hayashi et al., 1994, Plant Cell Physiol. 35:1199-1205).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      XG is bound to cellulose microfibrils in the cell walls of all dicotyledons and some monocotyledons (reviewed by Roberts, 1994, Curr.
      <br/>

      The XG bound to the cellulose microfibrils cross-links the cell-wall framework.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Plant-cell expansion, including elongation, requires the integration of local wall-loosening and the controlled deposition of new wall materials.
      <br/>
      Fry et al. (1992, Biochem J. 282:821-828) and Nishitani and Tominaga (1992, J. Biol. Chem 267:21058-21064) purified xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase (XET) and endo-xyloglucan transferase (EXT), respectively.
      <br/>
      These two enzymes were shown to be responsible for the transfer of intermicrofibrillar XG from one segment to another XG molecule and thus, suggested to be wall loosening-enzymes.
    </p>
    <p num="13">However, McQueen-Mason et al. (1993, Planta 190:327-331) showed that XET activity did not correlate with in vitro cell wall extension in cucumber hypocotyls.</p>
    <p num="14">
      The effect of XG on growing tissues has been extensively investigated.
      <br/>
      XG oligosaccharides, produced by partial digestion with  BETA -(1-4)-D-glucanase and referred to as "oligosaccharins", alter plant-cell growth (reviewed by Aldington and Fry, 1993, Advances in Botanical Research 19:1-101).
      <br/>
      One such oligosaccharin, XXFG (XG9), antagonizes the growth promotion induced in pea stem segments by the auxin 2,4-D at a concentration of about 1 nM (York et al., 1984, Plant Physiol. 75:295-297; McDougall and Fry, 1988, Planta 175:412-416).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, at high concentrations (e.g., 100  MU M) oligosaccharins promote the elongation of etiolated pea stem segments (McDougall and Fry, 1990, Plant Physiol. 93:1042-1048).
      <br/>
      The mode of action of oligosaccharins is still unknown.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Another type of cell wall-loosening protein, termed "expansin", was isolated by McQueen-Mason et al. (1992, The Plant Cell 4:1425-1433).
      <br/>
      Expansin does not exhibit hydrolytic activity with any of the cell-wall components.
      <br/>
      It binds at the interface between cellulose microfibrils and matrix polysaccharides in the cell wall, and is suggested to induce cell wall expansion by reversibly disrupting noncovalent bonds within this polymeric network (McQueen-Mason and Cosgrove, 1995, Plant Physiol. 107:87-100).
      <br/>
      Some cellulose-binding organic substances alter cell growth and cellulose-microfibril assembly in vivo.
      <br/>
      Direct dyes, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and fluorescent brightening agents (FBAs, e.g., calcofluor white ST) prevent Acetobacter xylinum microfibril crystallization, thereby enhancing polymerization.
      <br/>
      These molecules bind to the polysaccharide chains immediately after their extrusion from the cell surface, preventing normal assembly of microfibrils and cell walls (Haigler, 1991, "Relationship between polymerization and crystallization in microfibril biogenesis," in Biosynthesis and Biodegradation of Cellulose, pp. 99-124, Haigler and Weimer eds., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York).
      <br/>
      Haigler discusses dyes and fluorescent brightening agents that bind to cellulose alter cellulose microfibril assembly in vivo.
      <br/>
      Modifications in cell shape were observed when red alga (Waaland and Waaland, 1975, Planta 126:127-138) and root tips (Hughes and McCully, 1975, Stain Technology 50:319-329) were grown in the presence of dyes.
      <br/>
      It is now evident that these molecules can bind to the cellulose chains immediately upon their extrusion from the cell surface of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Haigler and Brown, 1979 Science 210:903-906; Benziman et al., 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:6678-6682; Haigler et al., 1980, Science 210:903-906; Brown et al., 1982, Science 218:1141-1142) and prevent crystal-structure formation (Haigler and Chanzy, 1988, J. Ultrastruct.
      <br/>
      Mol. Struct. Res. 98:299-311).
      <br/>
      In addition, the rate of cellulose polymerization was shown to increase in the presence of dye (Benziman et al., 1980).
      <br/>
      Crystallization was proposed to be the bottleneck in this coupled reaction and its prevention to result in accelerated cellulose synthase activity.

    <p num="16">2.2. CELLULOSE BINDING PROTEINS AND DOMAINS</p>
    <p num="17">
      Many cellulases and hemicellulases (e.g., xylanases and mannases) have the ability to associate with their substrates.
      <br/>
      These enzymes typically have a catalytic domain containing the active site for substrate hydrolysis and a carbohydrate-binding domain or cellulose-binding domain (herein generally designated "CBD") for binding the insoluble cellulosic or hemicellulosic matrices.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      To date, more than one hundred and twenty cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) have been classified into ten families designated I-X (Tomme et al., 1995, "Cellulose-Binding Domains: Classification and Properties", in ACS Symposium Series 618 Enzymatic Degradation and Insoluble Carbohydrates, pp. 142-161, Saddler and Penner eds., American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C.) (incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      Most of the CBDs have been identified from cellulases and xylanases, but some are from other polysaccharides or from non-catalytic proteins.
      <br/>
      The CBDs identified thus far are from fungi, bacteria and slime molds.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The ten families of CBDs are as follows: family I CBDs are all from fungal  BETA -1,4-glycanases; family II CBDs are found in bacterial hydrolases; family III CBDs are found in  BETA -1,4-glucanases; family IV CBDs primarily have two conserved cysteine residues; family V is represented by a CBD from Erwinia chysanthemi; family VI CBDs are primarily from xylanases and nearly all located at the C-terminal end of the protein; family VII is represented by the CBD of Clostridium thermocellum; family VIII is represented by the CBD of Dictyostelium discoidum; family IX CBDs are all known to be present as tandem repeats at the C-terminal end of thermostable xylanases; and family X is represented by xylanase E from Pseudomonas florescens spp. cellulosa.
      <br/>

      Shoseyov and Doi (1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2192-2195) isolated a unique cellulose-binding protein (CbpA) from the cellulase "complex" of the cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium cellulovorans.
      <br/>
      This major subunit of the cellulase complex was found to bind to cellulose, but had no hydrolytic activity, and was essential for the degradation of crystalline cellulose.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The cbpA gene has been cloned and sequenced (Shoseyov et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:3483-3487).
      <br/>
      Using PCR primers flanking the cellulose-binding domain (herein, this specific CBD is designated "cbd") of CbpA, the latter was successfully cloned into an overexpression vector that enabled overproduction of the approximately 17 kDa cbd in Escherichia coli.
      <br/>
      The recombinant cbd exhibits very strong affinity to cellulose (U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,934; Goldstein et al., 1993, J. Bacteriol. 175:5762-5768; PCT International Publication WO 94/24158, all are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein).

      In recent years, several CBDs have been isolated from different sources.

      Most of these have been isolated from proteins that have separate catalytic, i.e., cellulase and cellulose binding domains, and only two have been isolated from proteins that have no apparent hydrolytic activity but possess cellulose-binding activity (Goldstein et al., 1993, J.

      It has already been established that XG chains cross-link the cellulosic network in the cell wall (reviewed by Roberts, 1994, Curr.
      <br/>
      Opin. Cell Biol. 6:688-694).
      <br/>
      It is accepted that a prerequisite for cell elongation is a loosening of the cross-linked cellulose network, by either hydrolysis as demonstrated by Inouhe and Nevins (1991, Plant Physiol. 96:426-431), transglycosylation (Fry et al., 1992, Biochem. J. 282:821-828; Nishitani and Tominaga, 1992, J. Biol. Chem. 267:21058-21064), or expansins that interact with the XG-cellulose bond (McQueen-Mason et al., 1992, The Plant Cell 4:1425-1433).
      <br/>
      By in vitro competition assays it was shown that cbd competes with XG for binding to cellulose.
      <br/>
      Maximum cbd binding to cellulose is achieved after 1 hour (Goldstein et al. 1993, J. Bacteriol. 175:5762-5768), compared to XG binding to cellulose that is achieved only after 4 hour (Hayashi et al. 1987, Plant Physiol. 83:384-389).
      <br/>
      It is suggested that, during the elongation process, cellulose microfibrils become exposed and cbd competes with XG on binding to the exposed cellulose microfibril.
      <br/>
      It is therefore possible that this competition results in a temporary loosening of the cell wall and consequently enhanced elongation.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The inhibitory effect of cbd on root elongation can be explained by steric hindrance of the cellulose fibrils by excess amounts of cbd, which block access for enzymes or other proteins that modulate cell elongation via loosening, of the rigid cellulose-fibril network.
      <br/>
      This hypothesis is supported by Nevins, who prevented auxin-induced elongation with anti- BETA -D-glucan antibodies (Hoson and Nevins, 1989, Plant Physiol. 90:1353-1358) or with antibodies specific to cell wall glucanases (Inouhe and Nevins, 1991, Plant Physiol. 96:426-431).

    <p num="31">3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="32">
      The present invention provides the production of transgenic plants which express a transgene or transgenic construct of a plant cell wall modulation protean or polypeptide so that the resulting plants have altered structure or morphology.
      <br/>
      The present invention particularly provides for altered structure or morphology by expressing a plant cell wall modulation protein or polypeptide such as, but not limited to, a cellulose binding protein, a cellulose binding domain or a cell wall modifying enzyme.
      <br/>
      In a particularly preferred embodiment, the cell wall modulation protein is a cellulose binding domain (CBs).
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      According to one embodiment of the present invention, achieving the desired plant of altered structural morphology can entail expression of a plant cell wall modulation protein or peptide under the regulation of a suitable promoter.
      <br/>
      In one mode of this embodiment, the promoter may be a plant promoter that is tissue- and/or developmental stage-specific.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Suitable promoters include such as, an elongating tissue specific promoter (e.g., cel1 promoter), the chalcone synthase promoter (CHS), and the PATATIN promoter from potato.
      <br/>
      In an alternative mode of this embodiment, the promoter is constitutive and active in all plant tissues, substantially along its entire life cycle (e.g., the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV 35S) promoter).
      <br/>
      However, any combination of promoters and transgenes encoding cell wall modulation proteins and polypeptides is also useful according to the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Also according to the invention, the cell wall modulation transgene may be secreted from the expressing plant cells which is achieved by having the cell wall modulation protein or polypeptide fused to any suitable secretion signal peptide.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The invention further provides seeds of transgenic plants wherein the seed has a plant cell wall modulation transgene or gene construct.
      <br/>
      The invention also encompasses progeny, clones, cell lines or cells of transgenic plants having a plant cell wall modulation transgene or gene construct.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      According to further features of the invention, a novel endo- BETA -1,4-glucanase (EGase) gene (cel1) and protein (Cel1) from Arabidopsis thaliana is provided.
      <br/>
      Also provided is an elongating tissue specific promoter (cel1 promoter) of the A. thaliana EGase gene or functional fragment thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      According to still further features of the present invention, isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding proteins or polypeptides having the amino acid sequence of the Arabidopsis cel1 of SEQ ID NO:4 or variants thereof are provided.
      <br/>
      In particular, an isolated nucleic acid molecule having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 is provided.
    </p>
    <p num="39">An isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising the genomic clone of the Arabidopsis endo-1,4- BETA -glucanase gene having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:9 is also provided.</p>
    <p num="40">
      According to still further features exemplified by specific embodiments, a polypeptide which includes an amino acid sequence corresponding to Arabidopsis thaliana cel1 gene, as well as allelic and species variants, and functional naturally occurring and man-made variants thereof are provided.
      <br/>
      The present invention also provides derivatives or analogs of the Arabidopsis Cel1 polypeptide.
    </p>
    <p num="41">Further, the present invention provides for nucleotide vectors containing the above nucleotide sequences and host cells containing the recombinant nucleic acid vectors.</p>
    <p num="42">
      According to still further features, a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of the Arabidopsis endo-1,4- BETA -glucanase (cel1) gene, allelic and species variants, and naturally occurring and man-made functional variants, derivatives and analogs thereof are provided.
      <br/>
      In addition, the proteins having endo-1,4- BETA -glucanase activity or the ability to bind cellulose or hemicellulose may have a non-naturally occurring amino acid sequence.
      <br/>
      A nucleic acid sequence encoding the latter may be derived from a random display library, using, for example, cellulose as a screening agent.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The present invention further relates to recombinant nucleic acid vectors comprising a first nucleic acid sequence encoding a secretion signal peptide and second nucleic acid sequence encoding a cell wall modulation protein or polypeptide.
      <br/>
      In more specific embodiments, the cell wall modulation proteins or polypeptides are selected from cellulose binding proteins, cellulose binding domains and cell wall modifying enzymes.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The invention is based in part, on a number of unanticipated surprising discoveries.
      <br/>
      One is the discovery that expressing a cellulose binding protein or a cellulose binding domain (CBD) in transgenic plants results in transgenic plants having altered structural morphology.
      <br/>
      The other is the finding that expressing the Arabidopsis thaliana endo-1,4- BETA -glucanase in transgenic plants also results in plants having altered structural morphology.
      <br/>
      These findings together indicate that expressing a cell wall modulation transgene in plants results in plants having altered structure or morphology.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      It is an object of the invention to express any CBD in a transgenic plant to alter plant morphology, e.g. to stimulate or inhibit growth.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, it is an object of the invention to express any CBD, under the control of the cell promoter, with the cel1 signal peptide to target the CBD to the cell wall thus resulting in tissue specific growth modulation.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The invention has utility in producing plants with altered structure or morphology.
      <br/>
      Such altered structure or morphology provides plants that have an improved rate of growth, a greater or less biomass, plants more or less resistant to biodegradation, plants more or less digestible to ruminant animals, plants with modified fibers, or plants with altered cellulose content.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The cel1 gene of the invention has utility as a transgene encoding cell wall modulation protein or polypeptide in a transgenic plant to alter the structure or morphology.
      <br/>
      The cel1 promoter of the present invention may be utilized as an elongating tissue specific plant promoter to express any protein, polypeptide or peptide of interest in a tissue specific manner in a transgenic plant.
      <br/>
      The Arabidopsis thaliana Cel1 protein of the invention can be used in any biochemical applications.
      <br/>
      The Cel1 secretion peptide of the invention may be utilized to facilitate the cellular secretion of any protein, polypeptide or peptide of interest.
    </p>
    <p num="48">3.1. DEFINITIONS</p>
    <p num="49">
      The term "altered structure or morphology" as used herein refers to any microscopic or macroscopic change in structure or morphology of the transgenic plant when compared to a progenitor plant cultivated under the same conditions.
      <br/>
      The altered structure or morphology can be associated, for example, with altered biomass, growth, yield, greater or less resistance to biodegradation, more or less digestible to reuminants, altered cellulose content, larger leaves/normal hypocotyls or smaller leaves/longer hypocotyls, etc. compared to a non-transgenic plant of the species.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The terms "protein", "polypeptide" and "peptide" are used interchangeably throughout the specification and claims.
      <br/>
      These terms also encompass glycosylated proteins, i.e., glycoproteins.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The term "cell wall modulation" as used herein refers to any alteration from a normal growth pattern of a plant.
      <br/>
      Therefore, according to the present invention, transgenic expression of a cell wall modulation protein or polypeptide results in altered plant structure or morphology.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The term "cellulose binding protein" refers to any protein, polypeptide or peptide including a glycoprotein, which specifically binds to cellulose or hemicellulose.
      <br/>
      The cellulose binding protein may or may not have cellulose or cellulolytic activity.
      <br/>
      The term "cellulose binding domain" (CBD) refers to any protein, polypeptide or peptide, including a glycoprotein, which is a region or portion of a larger protein, said region or portion which binds specifically to cellulose or hemicellulose.
      <br/>
      The cellulose binding domain (CBD) may be a part or portion of a cellulase, xylanse or other polysaccharidase, e.g. a chitinase, etc., a sugar binding protein such as maltose binding protein, etc., or a non-catalytic polysaccharide binding protein.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      To date, more than one hundred and twenty cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) have been classified into ten families designated I-X (Tomme et al., 1995, "Cellulose-Binding Domains: Classification and Properties", in ACS Symposium Series 618 Enzymatic Degradation and Insoluble Carbohydrates, pp. 142-161, Saddler and Penner eds., American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C.) (incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      Any of the CBDs described in Tomme or any variants thereof, any other presently known CBDs or any new CBDs which may be identified can be used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      In addition, the CBD may be selected from a phage display peptide or peptidomimetic library, random or otherwise, using cellulose as a screening agent. (See Smith, 1985, Science 228:1315-1317 and Lam, 1991, Nature 354:82-84).
      <br/>
      Further, the CBD may be derived by mutation of a portion of a protein, polypeptide or peptide, including a glycoprotein, which binds to a polysaccharide other than cellulose (or hemicellulose), such as a chitinase, which specifically binds chitin, or a sugar binding protein such as maltose binding protein, rendering said portion capable of binding to cellulose.
      <br/>
      In any event, the CBD binds cellulose or hemicellulose.

      In a particularly preferred embodiment, the transgenic plants express a cellulose binding domain.
      <br/>
      Any cellulose binding domain is advantageously used in this preferred embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="57">Without intending to be limited to a particular mechanism, the inventors note that the targets for engineering are genes encoding proteins or enzymes involved in the synthesis and/or rearrangement and/or degradation of cellulose in the plant cell wall.</p>
    <p num="58">
      The proteins, polypeptides or enzymes can be expressed to engineer a plant with desirable properties.

      Engineered plants exhibiting the desired altered structure or morphology can be used in plant breeding or directly in agricultural production or industrial applications.
      <br/>
      Plants having one altered enzyme, protein or polypeptide can be crossed with other altered plants engineered with alterations in other growth modulation enzymes, proteins or polypeptides to produce lines with even further enhanced altered structural morphology characteristics compared to the parents or progenitor plants.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      In another aspect, the present invention provides isolated nucleic acids encoding the Arabidopsis thaliana endo-1,4- BETA -glucanase (cel1), the cel1 promoter and the Cel1 protein.
      <br/>
      The invention also provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising the genomic sequence of the Arabidopsis thaliana cel1 gene encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:9.
      <br/>
      The present invention further provides nucleic acid molecules encoding proteins or polypeptides having the amino acid sequence of the A. thaliana Cel1 of SEQ ID No:4, as well as variants, derivatives or analogs thereof.
      <br/>
      The invention further provides nucleic acid vectors containing the described nucleic acid molecules and host cells containing the recombinant nucleic acid vectors.

      Solely for ease of explanation, the description of the invention is divided into the following sections: (A) transgenic plants expressing a cell wall modulation protein; (B) methods for generating transgenic plants, including (i) preparation of nucleic acid constructs, including optimal expression nucleic acid constructs; (ii) transformation of plants and plant cells; (iii) selection and identification of transformed plants and plant cells; (C) identification and isolation of a novel endo-1,4- BETA -glucanase gene of A. thaliana (cel1) useful to express a cell wall modification protein in the transgenic plants and (D) applications of or uses for the transgenic plants and the novel A. thaliana endo-1,4- BETA -glucanase cel1 gene, the cel1 signal sequence, the cel1 promoter and Cel1 protein and polypeptide equivalents.
      <br/>
      The description of the novel A. thaliana endo-1,4- BETA -glucanase gene also includes a description of the protein encoded, the cel1 signal sequence and the cel1 promoter, which itself is also useful as an elongating tissue specific promoter for the transgenic plants of the invention.

    <p num="62">5.1. TRANSGENIC PLANTS</p>
    <p num="63">
      The present invention encompasses transgenic plants comprising a transgene that directs the expression of a cell modulation protein or polypeptide, and the transgenic plant exhibits altered structure or morphology compared with a progenitor plant which does not contain the transgene, when the transgenic plant and the progenitor plant are cultivated under similar or equivalent growth conditions.
      <br/>
      The cell wall modulation transgene is a gene encoding a cellulose binding protein, a cellulose binding domain or cell wall modifying enzyme.
      <br/>
      According to a preferred embodiment, the cell wall modulation transgene is a gene encoding a cellulose binding domain.
      <br/>
      Any cellulose binding domain, as defined herein, can be used.
      <br/>
      For an illustrative, but in no way limiting example, a cellulose binding domain is obtainable from a bacterial, fungal or slime mold protein or polypeptide.
      <br/>
      For a more particular illustrative example, a cellulose binding domain is obtainable from Clostridium cellulovorans, Clostridium thermocellum or Cellulomonas fimi (e.g., CenA, CenB, CenD, Cex).
      <br/>
      Illustrative working examples of transgenic plants expressing a cellulose binding domain are presented infra herein in Sections 13, 15 and 18.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The cell wall modulation protein employed may be of any type.
      <br/>
      For example, the protein may be a higher plant protein known to be associated with plant growth elongation, such as, but not limited to, an endo-1,4- BETA -glucanase (EGase), endo-xyloglucan transferase, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, cellulose synthase, and expansin.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the EGase is a novel EGase, i.e. Cel1. In other specific embodiments, the EGase is obtainable from tomato or avocado.
    </p>
    <p num="65">However, the protein may alternatively be a bacterial, a fungal or a slime mold protein which modulates plant growth.</p>
    <p num="66">It is shown in the illustrative working examples herein that transgenic plants expressing Clostridium cellulovorans CBD are growth modulated in strong correlation with their genotype (i.e., homozygote or heterozygote).</p>
    <p num="67">
      The transgene may be selectively expressed in some tissues of the plant or at some developmental stages, or the transgene may be expressed in substantially all plant tissues, substantially along its entire life cycle.
      <br/>
      However, any combinatorial expression mode is also applicable.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      In another specific embodiment, the transgenic plant comprises a cell wall modulation protein or polypeptide which is an endo-1,4- BETA -glucanase.
      <br/>
      In a more specific embodiment, the EGase is obtainable from Arabidopsis thaliana. (See infra Section 5.3).
    </p>
    <p num="69">The present invention also encompasses transgenic plants having a gene construct comprising a transgene encoding a cell wall modulation polypeptide operably linked to a promoter so that the cell wall modulation polypeptide is expressed in the transgenic plant, and the transgenic plant exhibits altered structure or morphology compared with a progenitor plant which does not contain the gene construct when the transgenic plant and progenitor plant are cultivated under similar conditions.</p>
    <p num="70">
      In a specific embodiment, the promotor is a constitutive plant promoter.

      In a more specific embodiment, the plant promoter is the CaMV 35S promoter.

    <p num="79">5.2.1. Nucleic Acid Constructs</p>
    <p num="80">
      The properties of the nucleic acid sequences are varied as are the genetic structures of various potential host plant cells.
      <br/>
      This description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention includes a number of features which an artisan may recognize as not being absolutely essential, but clearly advantageous.
      <br/>
      These include methods of isolation, synthesis or construction of gene constructs, the manipulations of the gene constructs to be introduced into plant cells, certain features of the gene constructs, and certain features of the vectors associated with the gene constructs.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      Further, the gene constructs of the present invention may be encoded on DNA or RNA molecules.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, it is preferred that the desired, stable genotypic change of the target plant be effected through genomic integration of exogenously introduced nucleic acid construct(s), particularly recombinant DNA constructs.
      <br/>
      Nonetheless, according to the present invention, such genotypic changes can also be effected by the introduction of episomes (DNA or RNA) that can replicate autonomously and that are somatically and germinally stable.
      <br/>
      Where the introduced nucleic acid constructs comprise RNA, plant transformation or gene expression from such constructs may proceed through a DNA intermediate produced by reverse transcription.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      The nucleic acid constructs described herein can be produced using methods well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Artisans can refer to sources like Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York for teachings of recombinant DNA methods that can be used to isolate, characterize, and manipulate the components of the constructs as well as to build the constructs themselves.
      <br/>
      In some instances, where the nucleic acid sequence of a desired component is known, it may be advantageous to synthesize it rather than isolating it from a biological source.
      <br/>
      In such instances, an artisan can refer to teachings of references such as Caruthers et al., 1980, Nuc.
      <br/>
      Acids Res. Symp. Ser. 7:215-233, and Chow and Kempe, 1981, Nuc.
      <br/>
      Acids Res. 9:2807-2817.
      <br/>
      In other instances, the desired components may be advantageously produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification.
      <br/>
      For PCR teachings, an artisan can refer to the references such as Gelfand, 1989, PCR Technology, Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification, H. A. Erlich ed., Stockton Press, New York, 1988, Current Protocols In Molecular Biology, Vol. 2, Ch. 15, Ausubel et al. eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons.

    <p num="83">5.2.1.1. EXPRESSION CONSTRUCTS</p>
    <p num="84">
      In accord with the present invention, a transgenic plant with the ability to express a plant cell wall modulation polypeptide may be engineered by transforming a plant cell with a gene construct comprising a sequence encoding a plant cell wall modulation protein or polypeptide.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, a plant promoter is operably associated with a sequence encoding the desired plant cell wall modulation protein or polypeptide. ("Operably associated" or "operably linked" is used herein to mean that transcription controlled by the "associated" or "operably linked" promoter produces a functional messenger RNA, whose translation produces the polypeptide.) In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the associated promoter is a strong and non tissue- or developmental-specific plant promoter (e.g., a promoter that strongly expresses in many or all plant tissue types).
      <br/>
      Examples of such strong, "constitutive" promoters include, but are not limited to, the CaMV 35S promoter, the T-DNA mannopine synthetase promoter, and their various derivatives.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      In another embodiment of the present invention, it may be advantageous to engineer a plant with a gene construct comprising a sequence encoding a plant cell wall modulation protein or polypeptide operably associated with a tissue- or developmental-specific promoter, such as, but not limited to the cel1 promoter, the CHS promoter, the PATATIN promoter, etc.
      <br/>
      For example, where expression in elongating tissues and organs is desired, promoters such as the cel1 promoter may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      In yet another embodiment of the present invention, it may be advantageous to transform a plant with a gene construct comprising a sequence encoding a plant cell wall modulation protein or polypeptide operably linked to a modified or artificial promoter.
      <br/>
      Typically, such promoters, constructed by recombining structural elements of different promoters, have unique expression patterns and/or levels not found in natural promoters.
      <br/>
      See e.g., Salina et al., 1992, Plant Cell 4:1485-1493, for examples of artificial promoters constructed from combining cis-regulatory elements with a promoter core.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      In yet an additional embodiment of the present invention, the expression of a cell wall modulation gene may be engineered by increasing the copy number of the gene encoding the desired protein or polypeptide.
      <br/>
      One approach to producing a plant cell with increased copies of the desired gene is to transform with nucleic acid constructs that contain multiple copies of the gene.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a gene encoding the desired polypeptide can be placed in a nucleic acid construct containing an amplification-selectable marker (ASM) gene such as the glutamine synthetase (GS) or dihydrofolate reductase gene.
      <br/>
      Cells transformed with such constructs are subjected to culturing regimes that select cell lines with increased copies of ASM gene.
      <br/>
      See Donn et al., 1984, J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 2:549-562, for a selection protocol used to isolate of a plant cell line containing amplified copies of the GS gene.
      <br/>
      Because the desired gene is closely linked to the ASM gene, cell lines that amplified the ASM gene would also likely to have amplified the gene encoding the desired growth modulation polypeptide.
    </p>
    <p num="88">In still another embodiment of the present invention, the expression of a cell wall modulation protein or polypeptide may be engineered by transforming a plant cell with a nucleic acid construct encoding a regulatory gene that controls the expression of the endogenous gene or a transgene encoding the desired polypeptide, wherein the introduced regulatory gene is modified to allow for strong expression of the polypeptide in the desired tissues and/or developmental stages.</p>
    <p num="89">5.2.1.2. OTHER FEATURES OF RECOMBINANT NUCLEIC ACID CONSTRUCTS</p>
    <p num="90">
      The recombinant construct of the present invention may include a selectable marker for propagation of the construct.
      <br/>
      For example, a construct to be propagated in bacteria preferably contains an antibiotic resistance gene, such as one that confers resistance to kanamycin, tetracycline, streptomycin, or chloramphenicol.
      <br/>
      Suitable vectors for propagating the construct include plasmids, cosmids, bacteriophages or viruses, to name but a few.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      In addition, the recombinant constructs may include plant-expressible selectable or screenable marker genes for isolating, identifying or tracking of plant cells transformed by these constructs.
      <br/>
      Selectable markers include, but are not limited to, genes that confer antibiotic resistances (e.g., resistance to kanamycin or hygromycin) or herbicide resistance (e.g., resistance to sulfonylurea, phosphinothricin, or glyphosate).
      <br/>
      Screenable markers include, but are not limited to, the genes encoding  BETA -glucuronidase (Jefferson, 1987, Plant Molec Biol.
      <br/>
      Rep 5:387-405), luciferase (Ow et al., 1986, Science 234:856-859), and the B and C1 gene products that regulate anthocyanin pigment production (Goff et al., 1990, EMBO J 9:2517-2522).
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      In embodiments of the present invention which utilize the Agrobacterium system for transforming plants (see infra), the recombinant DNA constructs additionally comprise at least the right T-DNA border sequence flanking the DNA sequences to be transformed into plant cell.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, the sequences to be transferred in flanked by the right and left T-DNA border sequences.
      <br/>
      The proper design and construction of such T-DNA based transformation vectors are well known to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="93">5 5.2.2. TRANSFORMATION OF PLANTS AND PLANT CELLS</p>
    <p num="94">
      According to the present invention, a desirable plant may be obtained by transforming a plant cell with a nucleic acid construct described herein.
      <br/>
      In some instances, it may be desirable to engineer a plant or plant cell with several different gene constructs.
      <br/>
      Such engineering may be accomplished by transforming a plant or plant cell with all of the desired gene constructs simultaneously.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the engineering may be carried out sequentially.
      <br/>
      That is, genetic engineering is accomplished by transforming with one gene construct, obtaining the desired transformant after selection and screening, transforming the transformant with a second gene construct, and so on.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, each gene construct is be linked to a different selectable or screenable marker gene so as to facilitate the identification of plant transformants containing multiple gene inserts.
      <br/>
      In other embodiment, several different genes may be incorporated into one plant by crossing parental lines engineered for each gene.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      In an embodiment of the present invention, Agrobacterium is employed to introduce the gene construct into plants.
      <br/>
      Such transformation preferably uses binary Agrobacterium T-DNA vectors (Bevan, 1984, Nuc.
      <br/>
      Acid Res. 12:8711-8721), and the co-cultivation procedure (Horsch et al., 1985, Science 227:1229-1231).
      <br/>
      Generally, the Agrobacterium transformation system is used to engineer dicotyledonous plants (Bevan et al., 1982, Ann.
      <br/>
      Rev. Genet 16:357-384; Rogers et al., 1986, Methods Enzymol. 118:627-641).
      <br/>
      The Agrobacterium transformation system may also be used to transform, as well as transfer, DNA to monocotyledonous plants and plant cells. (see Hernalsteen et al., 1984, EMBO J 3:3039-3041 ; Hooykass-Van Slogteren et al., 1984, Nature 311:763-764; Grimsley et al., 1987, Nature 325:1677-179; Boulton et al., 1989, Plant Mol.
      <br/>
      Biol. 12:31-40.; and Gould et al., 1991, Plant Physiol. 95:426-434).
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      In other embodiments, various alternative methods for introducing recombinant nucleic acid constructs into plants and plant cells may also be utilized.
      <br/>
      These other methods are particularly useful where the target is a monocotyledonous plant or plant cell.
      <br/>
      Alternative gene transfer and transformation methods include, but are not limited to, protoplast transformation through calcium-, polyethylene glycol (PEG)- or electroporation-mediated uptake of naked DNA (see Paszkowski et al., 1984, EMBO J 3:2717-2722, Potrykus et al. 1985, Molec.
      <br/>
      Gen. Genet. 199:169-177; Fromm et al., 1985, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 82:5824-5828; and Shimamoto, 1989, Nature 338:274-276) and electroporation of plant tissues (D'Halluin et al., 1992, Plant Cell 4:1495-1505).
      <br/>
      Additional methods for plant cell transformation include microinjection, silicon carbide mediated DNA uptake (Kaeppler et al., 1990, Plant Cell Reporter 9:415-418), and microprojectile bombardment (see Klein et al., 1983, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 85:4305-4309; and Gordon-Kamm et al., 1990, Plant Cell 2:603-618).

    <p num="97">
      According to the present invention, a wide variety of plants and plant cell systems may be engineered for the desired physiological and agronomic characteristics described herein using the nucleic acid constructs of the present invention and the various transformation methods mentioned above.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, target plants and plant cells for engineering include, but are not limited to, those monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, such as crops including grain crops (e.g., wheat, maize, rice, millet, barley), fruit crops (e.g., tomato, apple, pear, strawberry, orange), forage crops (e.g., alfalfa), root vegetable crops (e.g., carrot, potato, sugar beets, yam), leafy vegetable crops (e.g., lettuce, spinach); flowering plants (e.g., petunia, rose, chrysanthemum), conifers and pine trees (e.g., pine fir, spruce); plants used in phytoremediation (e.g., heavy metal accumulating plants); oil crops (e.g., sunflower, rape seed) and plants used for experimental purposes (e.g., Arabidopsis).

    <p num="98">5.2.3. SELECTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF TRANSFORMED PLANTS AND PLANT CELLS</p>
    <p num="99">
      According to the present invention, desired plants may be obtained by engineering one or more of the disclosed gene constructs into a variety of plant cell types, including but not limited to, protoplasts, tissue culture cells, tissue and organ explants, pollens, embryos as well as whole plants.
      <br/>
      In an embodiment of the present invention, the engineered plant material is selected or screened for transformants (those that have incorporated or integrated the introduced gene construct(s)) following the approaches and methods described below.

      In addition to the plant cel1 nucleotide sequences described above, full length plant cel1 cDNA or gene sequences present in the same species and/or homologs of the cel1 gene present in other plant species can be identified and readily isolated, without undue experimentation, by molecular biological techniques well known in the art.
      <br/>
      The identification of homologs of the cel1 in related species can be useful for developing plant model systems for purposes of discovering plant cel1 agonists or antagonists to modify cel1 in plants to alter the following processes in either a positive or negative way: larger or smaller altered plant morphology.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, such cDNA libraries, or genomic DNA libraries derived from the organism of interest can be screened by hybridization using the nucleotides described herein as hybridization or amplification probes.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, genes at other genetic loci within the genome that encode proteins which have extensive homology to one or more domains of the cel1 gene product can also be identified via similar techniques.
      <br/>
      In the case of cDNA libraries, such screening techniques can identify clones derived from alternatively spliced transcripts in the same or different species.

    <p num="122">
      Screening can be by filter hybridization, using duplicate filters.

      The hybridization washing conditions used should be of a lower stringency, as described above, when the cDNA library is derived from an organism different from the type of organism from which the labeled sequence was derived.

      Alternatively, the labeled cel1 nucleotide probe may be used to screen a genomic library derived from the organism of interest, again, using appropriately stringent conditions.
      <br/>
      The identification and characterization of plant genomic clones is helpful for use in transgenic plants for regulating plant structural morphology.
      <br/>
      For example, sequences derived from regions adjacent to the intron/exon boundaries of the plant gene can be used to design primers for use in amplification assays to detect mutations within the exons, introns, splice sites (e.g., splice acceptor and/or donor sites), etc.

    <p num="124">
      Further, a cel1 gene homolog may be isolated from nucleic acid of the organism of interest by performing PCR using two degenerate oligonucleotide primer pools designed on the basis of amino acid sequences within the plant cel1 gene product disclosed herein.

      The PCR product may be subcloned and sequenced to ensure that the amplified sequences represent the sequences of a plant cel1 gene.

      <br/>
      For example, the amplified fragment may be labeled and used to screen a cDNA library, such as a plant cDNA library.

      <br/>
      A reverse transcription reaction may be performed on the RNA using an oligonucleotide primer specific for the most 5' end of the amplified fragment for the priming of first strand synthesis.
      <br/>
      The resulting RNA/DNA hybrid may then be "tailed" with guanines using a standard terminal transferase reaction, the hybrid may be digested with RNAase H, and second strand synthesis may then be primed with a poly-C primer.
      <br/>
      Thus, cDNA sequences upstream of the amplified fragment may easily be isolated.

      <br/>
      Additionally, such plant cel1 gene sequences can be used to detect plant cel1 gene regulatory (e.g., promoter or promotor/enhancer) defects which can affect plant growth.

      A cDNA of a mutant plant cel1 gene may be isolated, for example, by using PCR, a technique which is well known to those of skill in the art.

      In this case, the first cDNA strand may be synthesized by hybridizing an oligo-dT oligonucleotide to mRNA isolated from tissue known or suspected to be expressed in a plant species putatively carrying the mutant plant cel1 allele, and by extending the new strand with reverse transcriptase.
      <br/>
      The second strand of the cDNA is then synthesized using an oligonucleotide that hybridizes specifically to the 5' end of the normal gene.
      <br/>
      Using these two primers, the product is then amplified via PCR, cloned into a suitable vector, and subjected to DNA sequence analysis through methods well known to those of skill in the art.
      <br/>
      By comparing the DNA sequence of the mutant plant cel1 allele to that of the normal plant cel1 allele, the mutation(s) responsible for the loss or alteration of function of the mutant plant cel1 gene product can be ascertained.

      Alternatively, a genomic library can be constructed using DNA obtained from a plant species suspected of or known to carry the mutant plant cel1 allele, or a cDNA library can be constructed using RNA from a tissue known, or suspected, to express the mutant plant cel1 allele.

      The normal plant cel1 gene or any suitable fragment thereof may then be labeled and used as a probe to identify the corresponding mutant plant cel1 allele in such libraries.

      In this manner, gene products made by the putatively mutant tissue may be expressed and screened using standard antibody screening techniques in conjunction with antibodies raised against the normal plant cel1 gene product, as described, below, in Section 5.3. (For screening techniques, see, for example, Harlow, E. and Lane eds., 1988, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor.) Additionally, screening can be accomplished by screening with labeled Cel1 fusion proteins.
      <br/>
      In cases where a plant cel1 mutation results in an expressed gene product with altered function (e.g., as a result of a missense or a frameshift mutation), a polyclonal set of antibodies to plant cel1 are likely to cross-react with the mutant plant cel1 gene product.

      While the Cel1 polypeptides and peptides can be chemically synthesized (e.g., see Creighton, 1983, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Principles, W.H.

      For example, when cloning in bacterial systems, inducible promoters such as pL of bacteriophage  LAMBDA , plac, ptrp, ptac (ptrp-lac hybrid promoter) and the like may be used; when cloning in insect cell systems, promoters such as the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter may be used; when cloning in plant cell systems, promoters derived from the genome of plant cells (e.g., the cel1 promoter, heat shock promoters; the promoter for the small subunit of RUBISCO; the promoter for the chlorophyll a/b binding protein) or from plant viruses (e.g., the 35S RNA promoter of CaMV; the coat protein promoter of TMV) may be used; when cloning in mammalian cell systems, promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5 K promoter) may be used; when generating cell lines that contain multiple copies of the cel1 DNA SV40-, BPV- and EBV-based vectors may be used with an appropriate selectable marker.

      In cases where plant expression vectors are used, the expression of the cel1 coding sequence may be driven by any of a number of promoters.
      <br/>
      For example, viral promoters such as the 35S RNA and 19S RNA promoters of CaMV (Brisson et al., 1984, Nature 310:511-514), or the coat protein promoter of TMV (Takamatsu et al., 1987, EMBO J. 6:307-311) may be used; alternatively, plant promoters such as the cel1 promoter or functional fragments thereof, the small subunit of RUBISCO (Coruzzi et al., 1984, EMBO J. 3:1671-1680; Broglie et al., 1984, Science 224:838-843); or heat shock promoters, e.g., soybean hsp17.5-E or hsp17.3-B (Gurley et al., 1986, Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:559-565) may be used.
      <br/>

      For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred.

      For example, cell lines which stably express the plant Cel1 protein may be engineered.

      Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with the cel1 DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker.

      Some of the more commonly employed site-directed mutagenesis protocols take advantage of vectors that can provide single stranded as well as double stranded DNA, as needed.
      <br/>
      Generally, the mutagenesis protocol with such vectors is as follows.
      <br/>
      A mutagenic primer, i.e., a primer complementary to the sequence to be changed, but consisting of one or a small number of altered, added, or deleted bases, is synthesized.
      <br/>
      The primer is extended in vitro by a DNA polymerase and, after some additional manipulations, the now double-stranded DNA is transfected into bacterial cells.

      Next, by a variety of methods, the desired mutated DNA is identified, and the desired protein is purified from clones containing the mutated sequence.

      For longer sequences, additional cloning steps are often required because long inserts (longer than 2 kilobases) are unstable in those vectors.

      The first 25 amino acids at the N-terminus were hydrophobic, including a positively charged arginine residue near the very end of the N-terminus, as expected in a typical signal-peptide sequence (Von Heijne et al., 1983, Eur. J. Biochem. 133:17-21).

    <p num="248">
      Fifteen to twenty independent transgenic tobacco plants (F0, parental generation) were prepared from each one of the vectors pCCI, p35SCI and pBI101. pBI101 served as a negative control as it does not encode for cbd.
      <br/>
      Conformation of the presence of a transgene was conducted by PCR analysis (see, for example, FIG. 9), Southern blot analysis (not shown), and kanamycin resistance.
      <br/>
      The results indicated the presence of a single copy of the cbd construct in the F0 generation for both the pCCI and p35SC1 constructs, and of at least two copies for the pBI101 in the control plants.
      <br/>
      Transcription of cbd in both PCCI and p35SC1 transgenic plants was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (see, for example, FIG. 10).
    </p>
    <p num="249">
      F1 transgenic tobacco plants transformed with either PCCI or p35SC1 (the latter are shown in FIG. 11B) displayed great size variation.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 11A, the F1 control plants transfected with pBI101 showed very moderate variation.
      <br/>
      In the latter case no kanamycin sensitive plants were observed, indicating the presence of more than a single active copy of the transgene, each of the copies independently segregates.
    </p>
    <p num="250">
      F1 transgenic tobacco plants of a parent transformed with a single copy of either pCCI or p35SC1 segregated into three distinct phenotypes.
      <br/>
      About a quarter of the F1 plants were kanamycin sensitive, indicating absence of the transgene.
      <br/>
      An additional quarter of the plants had a small phenotype, whereas about half of the plants had a large phenotype.
      <br/>
      The two later segregates further exhibited phenotypic variation.
      <br/>
      Among the small plants, some exhibited distorted hypocotyls at the early stages of germination.
      <br/>
      Among the large plants, variation was from normal size (as compared to kanamycin grown pBI101 control transgenic plants) to giant size.
      <br/>
      Collectively, these results indicate that the kanamycin sensitive plants were homozygous for the absence of the transgene, the large plants were hetererozygotes, whereas the small plants contained two active copies of the transgene.
      <br/>
      These results are in very good correlation with the report (PCT Publication WO 94/24158) demonstrating that high concentrations of cbd protein inhibit plant growth in vitro, whereas, moderate concentrations accelerate plant growth.
      <br/>
      When grown without kanamycin, F1 transgenic tobacco plants transformed with either pCC1 or p35SC1 segregated into the large and small phenotypes.
      <br/>
      Under these growth conditions, the kanamycin sensitive plants could not be distinguished from the subpopulation of heterozygous normal size plants of the large phenotype.
      <br/>
      These results confirm that cbd genotype is responsible for the observed phenotypes, i.e., expression of cbd in transgenic plants modulates their growth.
    </p>
    <p num="251">The difference in size among the phenotypically distinct groups (large and small) was also maintained after maturation (FIG. 12).</p>
    <p num="252">
      Furthermore, transgenic plants that were vegetatively propagated maintained their phenotype while young (FIG. 13) as well as in a later stage of their vegetative development (FIG. 14).
      <br/>
      These results demonstrate that cbd transgenic plants exhibiting an altered growth phenotype, maintain the altered phenotype even when vegetatively propagated.

      The two specific phenotypes generated by cbd expressing transgenes (large leaves/normal hypocotyl and small leaves/long hypocotyl) and large and small seedlings of control plants were selected and transferred to fresh medium and grown for additional 3-4 weeks in the growth room and then transferred to the green house for 3-4 weeks.
      <br/>

    <p num="270">18. EXAMPLE: THE EFFECT OF CBD ON CELLULOSE SYNTHESIS IN ACETOBACTER XYLINUM</p>
    <p num="271">18.1. INTRODUCTION</p>
    <p num="272">
      The gram-negative bacterium Acetobacter xylinum has long been regarded as a model of cellulose synthesis because cellulose microfibril synthesis is separated from cell wall formation (Ross et al. 1991, Microbiological Reviews 55:35-58).
      <br/>
      Since polymerization and crystallization are coupled processes in A. xylinum cellulose synthesis, interference with the crystallization results in an acceleration of polymerization (Benziman et al. 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:6678-6682).
      <br/>
      Some cellulose-binding organic substances can also alter cell growth and cellulose-microfibril assembly in vivo.
      <br/>
      For example, direct dyes, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and fluorescent brightening agents (FBAs, e.g., calcofluor white ST) bind to the polysaccharide chains immediately after their extrusion from the cell surface, preventing normal assembly of microfibrils and cell walls.
      <br/>
      These molecules prevent microfibril crystallization, and therefore enhance polymerization. (Haigler, 1991, "Relationship between polymerization and crystallization in microfibril biogenesis," in: Biosynthesis and Biodegradation of Cellulose, pp. 99-124, eds C. H. Haigler and P. J. Weimer, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York).
    </p>
    <p num="273">This experiment was conducted to determine the effects of cbd expression on cellulose synthesis.</p>
    <p num="274">18.2. MATERIAL AND METHODS</p>
    <p num="275">
      Aectobacter xylinum strain ATCC 23769 was used.
      <br/>
      Cells were grown for 24 hr in constant shaking at 30 (degree)  C. in a medium consisting of 0.5% Bactopeptone, 0.5% Yeast extract, 2% glucose and 0.3% K2 HPO4 pH 6, and 1.5 Unit/ml Trichoderma viride cellulase (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland).
      <br/>
      The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with pre-cooled phosphate buffer (50 mM NaH2 PO4 pH 6).
      <br/>
      The bacterial pellet was resuspended in phosphate buffer to a concentration of 2 mg/ml dry weight (2.5 O.D600 =1 mg/ml).
      <br/>
      One ml of each of the reaction mixtures was placed in 20 ml scintillation vials containing 0.8 mg cells/ml phosphate buffer.
      <br/>
      Cellulose synthesis was initiated by the addition of 40 mM glucose (D-�U14 C� glucose (Amersham, England) at a specific activity of 40,000 cpm MU  mol and allowed to occur for 1-2 hr at 30 (degree)  C. with constant shaking.
      <br/>
      The 14 CO2 formed was trapped in coverless Ependorf tubes containing 0.2 ml 1 M NaOH placed in the reactions vial.
      <br/>
      The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of 0.5 M HCl to the bacterial suspension and incubated for 15 min.
      <br/>
      One hundred and fifty Al of the NaOH solution containing the trapped 14 CO2 were transferred to scintillation tubes.
      <br/>
      The cells and the cellulose were transferred to 1.5 ml Ependorf tubes, centrifuged and washed three times with water.
      <br/>
      The cells were lysed by mixing with 0.2 N NaOH, 1% SDS.
      <br/>
      Cellulose was recovered on GF/A filter (Whatman, Shrewsbury, Mass.) washed with 15 ml of water and dried in an oven at 60 (degree)  C. Filters and NaOH containing trapped 14 CO2 were counted in a scintillation counter using "OPTI-FLUOR" (Packard) scintillation liquid to measure glucose incorporation (cellulose synthase activity) and respiration.
    </p>
    <p num="276">
      Electron microscopy was conducted by placing a drop of the appropriate solution on top of a copper grid at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The cellulose synthesis reaction contained 0.5 mg/ml dry weight cells in phosphate buffer, 40 mM glucose with or without CBD at a concentration of 300  MU g/ml.
      <br/>
      The reaction was incubated for 30 min and then stopped with 2.5% glutardialdehyde (Merck, Rahway, N.J.) for 30 min, washed three times with water and dried.
      <br/>
      The grids were negatively stained with 1.5% phosphotungstic acid and examined with a Jeol 100 CX electron microscope operating at 80 kV.
    </p>
    <p num="277">18.3. RESULTS</p>
    <p num="278">
      Resting cells of Aectobacter xylinum were allowed to synthesize cellulose in phosphate buffer containing radioactive glucose and different concentrations of cbd or calcofluor (as a positive control) and BSA (as a negative control) for 1 hr or for the indicated length of time.
      <br/>
      Cellulose synthase activity was determined by the amount of glucose incorporated.
      <br/>
      FIG. 30 shows the effect of cbd at different concentrations (10-500  MU g/ml, 0.6-30  MU M) compared with 1 mM calcofluor and 100  MU g/ml BSA (1.5  MU M).
      <br/>
      The cbd increased glucose incorporation in a dose responsive manner by up to five-fold at 500  MU g/ml.
      <br/>
      Calcofluor increased the rate by two-fold while BSA had no effect.
      <br/>
      The rate of glucose oxidation to CO2 was only marginally affected.
      <br/>
      Thus, glucose incorporation could be attributed to cellulose synthesis.
    </p>
    <p num="279">Electron microscopy examination of the cellulose ribbons produced by A. xylinum showed that CBD treatment resulted in a splayed ribbon composed of separate fibrillar subunits as compared with a thin and uniform ribbon in the control as shwon in FIG. 31.</p>
    <p num="280">
      This example demonstrates, using the model system (Acetobacter xylenum), that cbd enhances cellulose synthase activity, comparable with the effect of the fluorescent brightening agent calcofluorwhite.
      <br/>
      The effect of cbd on cellulose synthase activity was dose-responsive with an optimum response around 10 mg/ml.
    </p>
    <p num="281">18.4. DISCUSSION</p>
    <p num="282">
      It is evident that polymerization and crystallization are coupled reactions in cellulose synthesis in Acetobacter xylinum bacteria (Benziman et al., 1980 Proc.
      <br/>
      Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:6678-6682).
      <br/>
      Addition of cbd to the culture medium enhanced the incorporation of radioactive glucose in A. xylinum.
      <br/>
      While not intending to be limited to any particular mechanism of action on cellulose synthesis, the present inventors believe that cbd enhanced incorporation of radioactive glucose by interfering with the cellulose crystallization process.
      <br/>
      Our hypothesis is supported by Haigler's review (1991, "Relationship between polymerization and crystallization in microfibril biogenesis," in: Biosynthesis and Biodegradation of Cellulose, pp. 99-124, eds Haigler and Weimer, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York), in which dyes and fluorescent brightening agents that bind to cellulose were shown to alter cellulose microfibril assembly in vivo.
      <br/>
      Modifications in cell shape were observed when red alga (Waaland and Waaland, 1975, Planta 126:127-138) and root tips (Hughes and McCully, 1975, EMBO J. 6:3901-3907) were grown in the presence of dyes.
      <br/>
      It is now evident that these molecules can bind to the cellulose chains immediately upon their extrusion from the cell surface of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Haigler and Brown, 1979, J. Cell Biol. 83, 70a; Benziman et al., 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:6678-6682; Haigler et al., 1980, Science 210:903-906; Brown et al., 1982, Science 218:1141-1142) and prevent crystal-structure formation (Haigler and Chanzy, 1988, J. Ultrastruct.
      <br/>
      Mol. Struct. Res. 98:299-311).
      <br/>
      In addition, the rate of cellulose polymerization was shown to increase up to fourfold in the presence of dye (Benziman et al., 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:6678-6682).
      <br/>
      Crystallization was proposed to be the bottleneck in this coupled reaction and its prevention to result in accelerated polymerization.
      <br/>
      The effect of cbd as observed by electron microscopy is comparable to the effect of CMC (carboxy methyl cellulose) rather than to the effect of calcofluor (Haigler, 1991, "Relationship between polymerization and crystallization in microfibril biogenesis," in Biosynthesis and Biodegradation of Cellulose, pp. 99-124, eds Haigler and Weimer, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York) in both cases the cellulose ribbon only splayed.
      <br/>
      The effect of cbd on cellulose synthase activity was higher than the effect of CMC and was comparable to and even higher than that of calcofluor (FIG. 30).
      <br/>
      The different effects of cbd, CMC and calcofluor can be attributed to the differences in the molecular weights and the affinities to cellulose.
      <br/>
      CMC (90 kDa) can only prevent the normal association of larger fibrillar subunits and, therefore, hardly alters crystallization, while the small molecule calcofluor prevents the glucan chain association immediately after its initiation.
      <br/>
      The size of the cbd is somewhere in between that of calcofluor and CMC.
      <br/>
      On one hand, it is not small enough to prevent association of very small fibrils as achieved by calcofluor, but on the other hand, its high affinity to cellulose makes it an efficient cellulose intercalating agent which leads to an increase in the rate of cellulose synthesis of up to fivefold.
    </p>
    <p num="283">Based on results presented above, transgenic plants, such as alfalfa for example, expressing any CBD, including but not limited to cbd, will not only have higher level of biomass, but also have cellulose more amenable for degradation by ruminants and, therefore, have a higher nutritional value than normal non-transgenic plants.</p>
