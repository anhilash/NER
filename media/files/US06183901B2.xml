    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates generally to the field of separators for electrochemical cells.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention pertains to separators for electrochemical cells which comprise at least one microporous pseudo-boehmite layer and at least one protective coating layer comprising a polymer; electrolyte elements comprising such separators; electric current producing cells comprising such separators; and methods of making such separators, electrolyte elements, and cells.

    <p num="3">
      Throughout this application, various publications, patents, and published patent applications are referred to by an identifying citation.
      <br/>
      The disclosures of the publications, patents, and published patent specifications referenced in this application are hereby incorporated by reference into the present disclosure to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In an electric current producing cell or battery, discharge of the cell from its charged state occurs by allowing electrons to flow from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit resulting in the electrochemical reduction of the cathode active material at the cathode and the electrochemical oxidation of the anode active material at the anode.
      <br/>
      Under undesirable conditions, electrons may flow internally from the anode to the cathode, as would occur in a short circuit.
      <br/>
      To prevent this undesirable internal flow of electrons that occurs in a short circuit, an electrolyte element is interposed between the cathode and the anode.
      <br/>
      This electrolyte element must be electronically non-conductive to prevent the short circuiting, but must permit the transport of positive ions between the anode and the cathode during cell discharge, and in the case of a rechargeable cell, during recharge.
      <br/>
      The electrolyte element should also be stable electrochemically and chemically towards both the anode and the cathode.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Typically, the electrolyte element contains a porous material, referred to as a separator since it separates or insulates the anode and the cathode from each other, and an aqueous or non-aqueous electrolyte in the pores of the separator.
      <br/>
      The aqueous or non-aqueous electrolyte typically comprises ionic electrolyte salts and electrolyte solvents, and optionally, other materials such as for example, polymers.
      <br/>
      A variety of materials have been used for the porous layer or separator of the electrolyte element in electric current producing cells.
      <br/>
      These porous separator materials include polyolefins such as polyethylenes and polypropylenes, glass fiber filter papers, and ceramic materials.
      <br/>
      Usually these separator materials are supplied as porous free standing films which are interleaved with the anodes and the cathodes in the fabrication of electric current producing cells.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the porous separator layer can be applied directly to one of the electrodes, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,341 to Bagley et al.

      Porous separator materials have been fabricated by a variety of processes including, for example, stretching combined with special heating and cooling of plastic films, extraction of a soluble plasticizer or filler from plastic films, and plasma oxidation.
      <br/>
      The methods for making conventional free standing separators typically involve extrusion of melted polymeric materials either followed by a post-heating and stretching or drawing process or followed by a solvent extraction process to provide the porosity throughout the separator layer. U.S. Pat. No. 5,326,391 to Anderson et al. and references therein, describe the fabrication of free standing porous materials based on extraction of a soluble plasticizer from pigmented plastic films. U.S. Pat. No. 5,418,091 to Gozdz et al. and references therein, describe forming electrolyte layers by extracting a soluble plasticizer from a fluorinated polymer matrix either as a coated component of a multilayer battery structure or as an individual separator film. U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,341 to Bagley et al. describes an electrolyte element with a microporous silica layer and an organic electrolyte.
      <br/>
      The silica layer was the product of the plasma oxidation of a siloxane polymer.
      <br/>
      These manufacturing methods for free standing separators are complex and expensive and are not effective either in providing ultrafine pores of less than 1 micron in diameter or in providing separator thicknesses of less than 15 microns.

      The pseudo-boehmite separators and methods of making such separators are described for both free standing separators and as a separator layer coated on an electrode.

    <p num="9">
      As the non-aqueous electrolyte in the pores of the separator of an electrolyte element, a liquid organic electrolyte comprising organic solvents and ionic salts is typically used.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a gel or solid polymer electrolyte containing polymers and ionic salts, and optionally organic solvents, might be utilized instead of the liquid organic electrolyte.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,597,659 and 5,691,005 to Morigaki et al. describe a separator matrix formed of a microporous polyolefin membrane impregnated in its pores with an ionic conductive gel electrolyte.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In addition to being porous and being chemically stable to the other materials of the electric current producing cell, the separator should be flexible, thin, economical in cost, and have good mechanical strength.
      <br/>
      These properties are particularly important when the cell is spirally wound or is folded to increase the surface area of the electrodes and thereby improve the capacity and high rate capability of the cell.
      <br/>
      Typically, free standing separators have been 25 microns ( MU m) or greater in thickness.
      <br/>
      As batteries have continued to evolve to higher volumetric capacities and smaller lightweight structures, there is a need for separators that are 15 microns or less in thickness with a substantial increase in the area of the separator in each battery.
      <br/>
      Reducing the thickness from 25 microns to 15 microns or less greatly increases the challenge of providing porosity and good mechanical strength while not sacrificing the protection against short circuits or not significantly increasing the total cost of the separator in each battery.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      This protection against short circuits is particularly critical in the case of secondary or rechargeable batteries with lithium as the anode active material.
      <br/>
      During the charging process of the battery, dendrites can form on the surface of the lithium anode and can grow with continued charging.
      <br/>
      A key feature of the separator in the electrolyte element of lithium rechargeable batteries is that it have a small pore structure, such as 10 microns or less in pore diameter, and sufficient mechanical strength to prevent the lithium dendrites from contacting the cathode and causing a short circuit with perhaps a large increase in the temperature of the battery leading to an unsafe explosive condition.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Another highly desirable feature of the separator in the electrolyte element is that it is readily wetted by the electrolyte which provides the ionic conductivity.
      <br/>
      When the separator material is a polyolefinic material, which has nonpolar surface properties, the electrolytes (which typically have highly polar properties) often poorly wet the separator material.
      <br/>
      This results in low capacities in the battery due to the nonuniform distribution of the electrolyte in the electrolyte element.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Further it would be highly advantageous to be able to prepare free standing separators by a relatively simple process of coating which directly provides ultrafine pores as small as 1 nm in diameter and can readily provide a range of thicknesses from 50 microns or greater down to 1 micron.
      <br/>
      Also, it would be advantageous to be able to prepare separators with ultrafine pores and a wide range of thicknesses coated directly on another layer of the electric current producing cell by a process of coating without requiring any subsequent solvent extraction or other complex process which is costly, difficult to control, and not effective in providing ultrafine pores.
    </p>
    <p num="14">A separator, particularly one with a thickness less than 25 microns, which is applicable for electric current producing cells, and which can avoid the foregoing problems often encountered with the use of polyolefinic and other conventional porous materials made using extrusion, extraction, or other processes would be of great value to the battery industry.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="54">
      The separators of the present invention provide superior electric current producing cell properties, particularly in cells utilizing separators with thicknesses below about 25 microns.
      <br/>
      Suitable electric current producing cells for use with the separator of the present invention include, but are not limited to, primary and secondary batteries, capacitors including supercapacitors, fuel cells, and electrochemical sensors and displays, including bipolar configurations of batteries and capacitors, as these various electric current producing devices are known in the art.
      <br/>
      Conventional separators, such as porous polyolefins, porous fluoropolymers where the porosity is provided by a solvent extraction process, and glass fiber papers, and the like, are difficult and costly to manufacture, especially at thicknesses below about 25 microns.
      <br/>
      Due to the nature of the processes used to manufacture these separators and the relatively large pore sizes intrinsic to these separators, electrical shorting may be a significant challenge at separator thicknesses of below about 25 microns, especially at thicknesses below about 15 microns.
      <br/>
      To overcome these limitations, the separators of the present invention for use in electric current producing cells comprise (i) at least one microporous pseudo-boehmite layer in contact with (ii) at least one protective coating layer comprising a polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Microporous pseudo-boehmite separator layers, as for example, described by Carlson et al. in copending U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/995,089, to the common assignee, are effective in many electrochemical cell configurations.
      <br/>
      However, pseudo-boehmite separator layers may lack sufficient strength and flexibility to be configured into cells with, for example, a prismatic configuration.
      <br/>
      The separator of the present invention provides an improvement whereby the pseudo-boehmite layer of the separator is coated with a protective coating layer comprising a polymer.
      <br/>
      This protective coating layer provides a protective layer which enhances the strength and adds flexibility to the pseudo-boehmite layer of the separator.
      <br/>
      Electrochemical cells in a prismatic configuration, such as those described in copending U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/215,030 to Thibault et al., to the common assignee, may be successfully built with this protective coated pseudo-boehmite separator.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the protective coating layer is resistant to electrolytes.

      The polymer of the protective coating layers of the separator of the present invention comprises one or more moieties from the polymerization of one or more monomers or macromonomers.

    <p num="69">
      The protective coating layer of the present invention enhances the properties of the one or more pseudo-boehmite layers, for example, it provides flexibility and toughness to the separator.
      <br/>
      At the same time the protective coating layer should not negatively impact the desired separator properties of the one or more pseudo-boehmite layers.
      <br/>
      Suitable polymeric protective coating layers should add flexibility and toughness to the separator while at the same time allowing cations, such as lithium ions, to pass through the separator.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, it is preferred that the polymeric protective coating layer slow or inhibit the passage of sulfide or polysulfide ions.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Multiphase polymers which are characterized by highly polar segments and less polar segments possess these properties and can be suitable for the protective coating layers.
      <br/>
      Examples of multiphase polymer structures include but are not limited to: (a) ethylene oxide polydimethylsiloxane graft copolymers as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,493 to Skotheim et al.; (b) block copolymers, for example, sulfonated olefin/styrene polymers, such as sulfonated-styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene triblock copolymers, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,468,574 and 5,679,482 to Ehrenberg et al., which comprise ion conducting components and flexible connecting components; (c) polymer blends such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,585,039 and 5,609,795 to Matsumoto et al.; and (d) graft copolymers such as acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene polymers (ABS) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,064,116 to Papetti.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The polymer blends (c) include, but are not limited to, acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      These polymers are elastomeric and thermoplastic composites and may possess toughness and good dimensional stability.
      <br/>
      By experimentation one skilled in the art can choose polymer blends with the desired flexibility and toughness in the protective layer.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the polar nature of the highly polar segments, for example, from the nitrile function in acrylonitrile, allow cation passage needed for the separator function.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Alternatively, the required porosity of the tough and flexible protective coating layer can be provided by dispersed polar fine pigments in non-polar polymers, such as, for example, silica in olefin polymers.
      <br/>
      Another approach to porosity in polymer coating layers is the formation of vesicular films.
      <br/>
      In a vesicular or voided structure the voids or bubbles are produced by decomposing a vesiculating agent by, for example, uv irradiation to generate a gas such as nitrogen upon exposure to light with subsequent heating to expand the size of the void or vesicle.
      <br/>
      Suitable vesiculating agents include a wide variety of diazo-compounds which liberate nitrogen upon exposure to light such as the quinone-diazides, azides, and carbazide compounds described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,143,418 and conventional diazo-compounds such as those mentioned in U.S. Pat. No. 3,779,768. Suitable resins for producing vesicular coatings are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,524 to Mandella et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,451,550 to Bennett et al.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The molecular weight of the polymer of the protective coating layer is preferably greater than 10,000.
      <br/>
      More preferred is a polymer of molecular weight greater than 50,000.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The thickness of the protective coating layer of the separator may vary over a wide range from about 0.2 microns to about 20 microns.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the protective coating layer has a thickness of from about 0.5 microns to about 15 microns.
      <br/>
      More preferred is a thickness of from about 0.5 microns to about 10 microns, and even more preferred is a thickness of from about 0.5 microns to about 5 microns, especially when multiple protective coating layers are present.
      <br/>
      Conventional separators, such as polyolefin materials, are typically 25 to 50 microns in thickness so it is particularly advantageous that the protective coated microporous separators of this invention can be effective and inexpensive at thicknesses well below 25 microns.
      <br/>
      In other words, it is preferable that the combined thickness of the one or more pseudo-boehmite layers and the one or more protective coating layers be below 25 microns.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The protective coating layer comprising a polymer of the separator of the present invention may further comprise a pigment.
      <br/>
      Suitable pigments for use in the polymer protective coating layer include, but are not limited to, colloidal silicas, amorphous silicas, surface treated silicas, colloidal aluminas, amorphous aluminas, conductive carbons, tin oxides, titanium oxides and polyethylene beads.
      <br/>
      Preferred pigments for use in the polymer protective coating layer are colloidal silicas, amorphous silicas, surface treated silicas, or a combination thereof.

      <br/>
      The silica layer is stated to provide improved abrasion resistance to the recording sheet, but no requirement for a polymer in the layer of silica or for durability during winding and folding, such as occurs in the fabrication of electric current producing cells, is described.

    <p num="84">The term "pseudo-boehmite," as used herein, pertains to hydrated aluminum oxides having the chemical formula Al2 O3.xH2 O wherein x is in the range of from 1.0 to 1.5. Terms used herein, which are synonymous with "pseudo-boehmite," include "boehmite," "AlOOH," and "hydrated alumina." The materials referred to herein as "pseudo-boehmite" are distinct from anhydrous aluminas (Al2 O3, such as alpha-alumina and gamma-alumina), and hydrated aluminum oxides of the formula Al2 O3.xH2 O wherein x is less than 1.0 or greater than 1.5.</p>
    <p num="85">
      The term "microporous," is used herein to describe the material of a layer, which material possesses pores of diameter of about 10 microns or less which are connected in a substantially continuous fashion from one outermost surface of the layer through to the other outermost surface of the layer.
      <br/>
      Porous separators which are made from fibers, such as glass, TEFLON (a trademark for polytetrafluoroethylene available from DuPont Corporation, Wilmington, Del.), and polypropylene, are generally characterized as non-woven separator materials and have pore diameters too large to be called microporous, thereby making them unacceptable for rechargeable cells where dendrite formation is a potential concern.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      The amount of these pores in the layer may be characterized by the pore volume, which is the volume in cubic centimeters of pores per unit weight of the layer.
      <br/>
      The pore volume may be measured by filling the pores with a liquid having a known density and then calculated by the increase in weight of the layer with the liquid present divided by the known density of the liquid and then dividing this quotient by the weight of the layer with no liquid present, according to the equation:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)

      <br/>
      Also, the pore volume may be estimated from the apparent density of the layer by subtracting the reciprocal of the theoretical density of the materials (assuming no pores) comprising the microporous layer from the reciprocal of the apparent density or measured density of the actual microporous layer, according to the equation:  (Equation image '2' not included in text)

      <br/>
      The porosity or void volume of the layer, expressed as percent by volume, can be determined according to the equation:  (Equation image '3' not included in text)

In a more preferred embodiment, the microporous pseudo-boehmite layer has a pore volume from 0.4 to 0.7 cm3 /g. Below a pore volume of 0.02 cm3 /g, the transport of ionic species is inhibited by the reduced pore volume.
      <br/>
      Above a pore volume of 2.0 cm3 /g, the amount of voids are greater which reduces the mechanical strength of the microporous pseudo-boehmite layer.

    <p num="91">
      In contrast to conventional microporous separators which typically have pore diameters on the order of 1 to 10 microns, the microporous pseudo-boehmite layers of the separator of the present invention have pore diameters which range from about 1 micron down to less than 0.002 microns. embodiment, the microporous pseudo-boehmite layer has an Microporous separator layers, such as the microporous pseudo-boehmite layers of the present invention, with pore diameters in the range of about 1 micron (100 nm) down to less than 0.002 microns (2 nm) are also commonly referred to in the art as nanoporous materials.

    <p num="92">
      One distinct advantage of separators with much smaller pore diameters on the order of 0.001 to 0.03 microns is that insoluble particles, even colloidal particles with diameters on the order of 0.05 to 1.0 microns, can not pass through the separator because of the ultrafine pores.
      <br/>
      In contrast, colloidal particles, such as the conductive carbon powders often incorporated into cathode compositions, can readily pass through conventional separators, such as microporous polyolefins, and thereby can migrate to undesired areas of the cell.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Another significant advantage of the separators of the present invention comprising a microporous pseudo-boehmite layer over conventional separators is that the nanoporous structure of the microporous pseudo-boehmite layer may function as an ultrafiltration membrane and, in addition to blocking all particles and insoluble materials, may block or significantly inhibit the diffusion of soluble materials of relatively low molecular weights, such as 2,000 or higher, while permitting the diffusion of soluble materials with molecular weights below this cutoff level.
      <br/>
      This property may be utilized to advantage in selectively impregnating or imbibing materials into the separator layers during manufacture of the electric current producing cell or in selectively permitting diffusion of very low molecular weight materials through the separator during all phases of the operation of the cell while blocking or significantly inhibiting the diffusion of insoluble materials or of soluble materials of medium and higher molecular weights.
    </p>
    <p num="94">Another important advantage of the extremely small pore diameters of the separators of the present invention is the strong capillary action of the tiny pores in the pseudo-boehmite layer which enhances the capability of the separators to readily take up or imbibe electrolyte liquids and to retain these materials in the pores.</p>
    <p num="95">
      The microporous pseudo-boehmite layer may optionally further comprise a variety of binders to improve the mechanical strength and/or other properties of the layer, as for example, described in the two aforementioned copending U.S. patent applications, both to Carlson et al. of the common assignee.
      <br/>
      Any binder that is compatible with the boehmite sol during mixing and processing into the microporous layer and provides the desired mechanical strength and uniformity of the layer without significantly interfering with the desired microporosity is suitable for use.
      <br/>
      The preferred amount of binder is from 5% to 70% of the weight of the pseudo-boehmite in the layer.
      <br/>
      Below 5 weight per cent, the amount of binder is usually too low to provide a significant increase in mechanical strength.
      <br/>
      Above 70 weight per cent, the amount of binder is usually too high and fills the pores to an excessive extent which may interfere with the transport of low molecular weight materials through the microporous layer.

      The binder may be inorganic, such as for example, silicas, gamma aluminum oxides, and alpha aluminum oxides, that are known to typically form gel matrix structures with pseudo-boehmite present, for example, as is known in the art of microporous sol gel ink receptive layers for ink jet printing.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the binders in the microporous pseudo-boehmite layer are organic polymer binders.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable binders include, but are not limited to, polyvinyl alcohols, polyethylene oxides, polyvinyl pyrrolidones, copolymers thereof, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Binders may be water soluble polymers and may have ionically conductive properties.
      <br/>
      Further preferred binders may also comprise plasticizer components such as, but not limited to, low molecular weight polyols, polyalkylene glycols, and methyl ethers of polyalkylene glycols to enhance the coating, drying and flexibility of the pseudo-boehmite layer.

    <p num="96">
      The thickness of the microporous pseudo-boehmite layer, with or without additional binder, for use in the separator of the present invention may vary over a wide range since the basic properties of microporosity and mechanical integrity are present in layers of a few microns in thickness as well as in layers with thicknesses of hundreds of microns.
      <br/>
      For various reasons including cost, overall performance properties of the separator, and ease of manufacturing, the desirable thicknesses of the microporous pseudo-boehmite layer are in the range of 1 micron to 50 microns.
      <br/>
      Preferred are thicknesses in the range of 1 micron to 25 microns.
      <br/>
      The more preferred thicknesses are in the range of 2 microns to 15 microns.
      <br/>
      The most preferred thicknesses are in the range of 5 microns to 15 microns.
      <br/>
      Conventional separators, such as the porous polyolefin materials, are typically 25 to 50 microns in thickness so it is particularly advantageous that the microporous separators of this invention can be effective and inexpensive at thicknesses well below 25 microns.

      The separators of this invention comprising a protective coated microporous pseudo-boehmite layer essentially retain the desirable properties of the uncoated pseudo-boehmite separator as described by Carlson et al. in the two aformentioned copending U.S. patent applications to the common assignee.
      <br/>
      These include blocking particles and insoluble materials, blocking or inhibiting the diffusion of soluble materials of relatively low molecular weights, such as 2,000 or higher, while permitting the diffusion of soluble materials with molecular weights below this cutoff level.

      Desirable properties also include permitting the diffusion of soluble materials especially electrolyte cations such as lithium ions.

      A further distinct advantage of the methods to produce a separator of the present invention is the flexibility in the coating patterns in which the separator layer may be applied to the substrate.

      For example, the separator layers may be applied over the entire outermost surface of the cathode including the top surface and sides of the cathode active layer on the current collector and cathode substrate.

      The cathode active layer may thus be completely encapsulated on all outermost surfaces, including the edges or sides of the cathode active layer which are not contacted or covered by conventional free standing polyolefin or other porous separators, by coating the separator layers in a pattern over all the outermost, exposed surfaces of the cathode active layer.

      This complete encapsulation by the separator layers of the present invention is very advantageous to safety and battery performance in providing an insulating surface to prevent any short circuits by the cathode during fabrication and during the use of the electric current producing cell.

      This encapsulation is also very advantageous to high cell capacity and long cycle life in acting as a barrier in blocking or inhibiting the migration of any insoluble or high molecular weight species in the cathode active layer to outside the cathode area and similarly in retarding the diffusion of any low molecular weight species, such as soluble polysulfides, in the cathode active layer to outside the cathode area.
