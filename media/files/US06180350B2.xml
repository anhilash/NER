      <br/>
      One embodiment of the present invention is a device and method for detecting the presence or absence of a signal nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      The device has comprising an electrode and a first nucleic acid covalently bound to the electrode.
      <br/>
      The first nucleic acid has two or more donor nucleotides capable of donating an electron.
      <br/>
      The donor nucleotides have a position in the first nucleic acid where one donor nucleotide is proximal to the electrode.
      <br/>
      The first nucleic acid has a modified nucleotide adjacent to one of the donor nucleotides.
      <br/>
      The modified nucleotide is capable of receiving an electron from said donor nucleotides upon photo-excitation and maintaining the electron for a first period of time when the first nucleic acid is unhybridized and a second period of time when the first nucleic acid is hybridized to the signal nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      The first and second periods are different.
      <br/>
      The electrode is in communication with the first nucleic acid to receive and donate electrons.
      <br/>
      The device further comprises a photon source for emitting photons onto the first nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      A charge monitor is in communication with the electrode for measuring the charge on the electrode or current flowing through the electrode as the first nucleic acid receives photons from the photon source which charge on said electrode is different in the presence of signal nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      The difference is indicative of the presence or absence of the signal nucleic acid.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This application relates to compositions, methods and apparatus for the photo-electrochemical detection of nucleic acid of a defined sequence.
      <br/>
      In particular, one aspect of the invention features a device having an electrode, a first nucleic acid, a source for photons and a charge monitor.
      <br/>
      The first nucleic acid is covalently bound to the electrode with electron donor nucleotides proximal to the electrode and a modified nucleotide adjacent to the donor nucleotide.
      <br/>
      The modified nucleotide has a base with a functional group capable of receiving or donating electrons.
      <br/>
      The first nucleic acid donates or receives electrons from the electrode upon receiving photons.
      <br/>
      The rate at which the electrode receives or donates electrons with the first nucleic acid is different when the first nucleic acid is hybridized and when the first nucleic acid is unhybridized.
      <br/>
      The charge monitor measures the rate at which the electrode receives or donates electrons to determine the presence or absence of a second nucleic acid capable of forming a hybridization product with the first nucleic acid.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">The following definitions are provided to facilitate an understanding of the invention.</p>
    <p num="4">
      The term "target" or "target molecule", in a diagnostic sense, refers to a molecule of interest, i.e. the molecule whose presence one wants to know.
      <br/>
      This application uses the term "signal nucleic acid" to refer to the target, if such target is present in sufficient quanities to produce a measurable response.
      <br/>
      However, the term "signal nucleic acid" also refers to nucleic acid that may be generated in the presence of target.
      <br/>
      By way of example, without limitation, signal nucleic acid may be generated in the presence of non-nucleic acid targets or nucleic acid targets through nucleic acid amplification reactions such as polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase reactions, such as Q-Beta replicase.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Nucleic acid antibody reactions are characterized by processes which are called SELEX (NexStar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Boulder CO).
      <br/>
      These processes describe the manner in which nucleic acids may be selected for affinity to non-nucleic acid targets, such as proteins and other molecules of interest.
      <br/>
      The selected nucleic acids can be used as ligands for affinity reactions in the manner similar to antibodies.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Nucleic acid hybridization reactions are based on the affinity exhibited by complementary strands of nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      Nucleic acid target molecules can be identified by the binding of such target to a complementary ligand nucleic acid.

    <p num="18">
      To facilitate a discussion of the present invention reference will be made to the accompanying drawings.
      <br/>
      This application relates to compositions, methods and apparatus for the photo-electrochemical detection of nucleic acid of a defined sequence.
      <br/>
      The nucleic acid of defined sequence, for the purpose of the present discussion, will be the signal nucleic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Turning now to FIG. 1A, an embodiment of the present invention, a device for detecting the presence or absence of a signal nucleic acid, generally referred to by the numeral 11, is illustrated in schematic form.
      <br/>
      The device 11 has a first electrode 15 and a second electrode 17.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the first electrode has a gold surface to allow covalent binding of a first nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      The process of binding such first nucleic acid to a gold substrate is well-known.
      <br/>
      An interferometric sensor (not shown) may substituted for the electrode 15, in a manner known to individuals skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A first nucleic acid 21 is covalently bound to the first electrode 15.
      <br/>
      The letter "Z" represents sequences of nucleic acid which are complementary to the signal nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      The first nucleic acid 21 has two or more donor nucleotides capable of donating an electron.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1A depicts three donor nucleotides, the guanosines most proximal to the electrode 15.
      <br/>
      The donor nucleosides have a position in said first nucleic acid where one donor nucleotide is proximal to the electrode 15.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The first nucleic acid 21 has a modified nucleotide, "AQ-dA", adjacent to one of the donor nucleosides.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the functional group is photo-reactive.
      <br/>
      A preferred functional group is selected from the group consisting of anthraquinone, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pterins, pyrene, quinidine, quinolone and derivatives thereof.
      <br/>
      A preferred modified nucleotide is depicted in FIG. 2A, anthraquinoeacetyl-N(C6)-2'-deoxyadenosine.
      <br/>
      This nucleoside can be synthesized by individuals skilled in the art of synthetic chemistry.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A further preferred modified nucleotide is depicted in FIG. 2B, N6-(anthraquinone2-carbonyl)-2'-deoxyadenosine.
      <br/>
      This nucleoside can also be synthesized by individuals skilled in the art of synthetic chemistry.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A scheme for the synthesis of this nucleotide is illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B. Briefly, in Reaction 1, commercially available 2'-deoxyadenosine 1 is reacted with t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBDMSiCl) to protect the 5'-and 3'-O-positions on the sugar with an easily removable t-butyldimethylsilyl group (TBDMSi) and produce 2.
      <br/>
      In Reaction 2, commercially available anthraquinone-2-carboylic acid is reacted with sulfonyl chloride to make anthraquinone-2-carbonyl chloride 4.
      <br/>
      In Reaction 3, compounds 2 and 4 are reacted with each other in the presence of a weak base such as pyridine in a dry aromatic solvent such as benzene to produce 5, N6-(anthrquinone-2-carbonyl)-3', 5'-di(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-2'-deoxyadenosine.
      <br/>
      In Reaction 4, the 3', 5'-TBDMSi groups are removed from 5 by reaction with tetrabutylamonium fluoride (TBAF) in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) to produce the nucleoside 6, N6-(anthraquinone-2carbonyl)-2'-deoxyadenosine.
      <br/>
      In Reaction 5, compound 7, the 5'-O-dimethyloxytrityl-3'-O-(2-cyanoethoxy)-N,N-diisopropylaminophosporamidite of 6 using standard procedures for making phosporamidite reagents for use in automated DNA synthesizers.
      <br/>
      First, the 5'-O position is protected with the dimethoxytrityl (DMT) group using 4, 4'-dimethoxytrityl chloride in dry pyridine.
      <br/>
      And, second, the 2'-O-position is reacted with 2-cyanoethoxy-N,N-diisoprpylaminochlorophosphine in an anhydrous mixture of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and dichloromethane.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Returning now to FIG. 1A, the modified nucleotide is capable of receiving an electron from the donor nucleotides upon photo-excitation and maintaining the electron for a first period of time when the first nucleic acid 21 is unhybridized and a second period of time when said first nucleic acid 21 is hybridized to the signal nucleic acid.</p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 1B depicts the first nucleic acid hybridized to the signal nucleic acid 23.
      <br/>
      The letter "S" denotes nucleotides in a sequence complementary to the first nucleic acid sequences "Z".
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The first and second periods are different and can be measured.
      <br/>
      The basis for the difference in the periods is illustrated in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 illustrates the excitation of the modified nucleotide, AQ-dG.
      <br/>
      The modified nucleotide moves quickly from a low energy state, S0, to a higher state, S1.
      <br/>
      Within picoseconds, an ionic form of the nucleotide is formed, which can not readily move to the original state because the reverse electron transfer is spin prohibited.
      <br/>
      To return to the original state, requires a period of 10 nanoseconds.
      <br/>
      However, in the presence of the signal nucleic acid 23, the reverse electron transfer is altered.
      <br/>
      As a single strand of DNA, the the modified nucleotide and the closest donor nucleotide of the first nucleic acid can combine rapidly allowing subsequent oxidation of donor nucleotides.
      <br/>
      However, the donor nucleotide closest to the modified nucleotide is most favored in the single stranded state.
      <br/>
      In the double stranded state, in the presence of the signal nucleic acid, the oxidation of the donor nucleotide most distant to the modified nucleotide, the donor nucleotide proximal to the electrode 15, is favored.
      <br/>
      Since it is further away, it will have a longer lifetime.
      <br/>
      The electrode 15 is in communication with said first nucleic acid 21 to receive and donate electrons.

    <p num="27">
      The device further comprises a photon source 31 for emitting photons onto the first nucleic acid 21.

      A preferred photon source 31 is a YAG laser or xenon flash light.

      The device further comprises a charge monitor 41.

      <br/>
      The charge monitor is preferably phase-locked with the photon source 31.
      <br/>
      This allows signal averaging at kilohertz or greater frequencies.

    <p num="29">

      The charge on said electrode or the current flowing through the electrode 15 is different in the presence of signal nucleic acid 23.
      <br/>
      The difference is indicative of the presence or absence of the signal nucleic acid 23.
