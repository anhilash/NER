    <p num="3">2. Description of Background and Relevant Information</p>
    <p num="4">
      Known container holders of the aforementioned type generally have a pocket, whose opening is directed upwardly, and which is attached to a belt, either in a detachable manner, or a fixed manner.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the pocket of these container holders is oriented perpendicularly, or substantially diagonally with respect to the belt such that in the transportation position, the container tends to remain inside by virtue of its own weight.
      <br/>
      In addition, for reasons of ease and habit, the pocket is usually provided with a curved opening so as to facilitate access to the container which, since it is normally carried on the back to allow the user to move his chest, is grasped "blindly" with only one of his hands.
      <br/>
      Also, a collar or an elastic necking and/or a lacing is often used to complete the pocket so as to prevent any accidental expulsion of the container during its transportation and, at the same time, to allow it to be extracted as desired.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      All these technical constructional details ensure that such container holders are deemed to be relatively satisfactory especially when the user is not time-constrained and when his/her movements are not limited, as is generally the case for non-competitive sporting activities.
      <br/>
      Conversely, as soon as one has to deal with competitive sports and/or sporting activities during which the container must constantly be carried on the back, as is the case with cross-country skiing, bicycling, all-terrain biking, running, etc., it becomes difficult to execute the hand manipulations required, on the one hand, to gain access to the container so that it can be grasped and extracted from the pocket and, on the other hand, to gain access to the pocket so as to replace the container.
      <br/>
      As a matter of fact, these manipulations are executed "blindly" during the sporting event without the user ever really stopping, thus making it almost impossible for such user to locate the exact position of the pocket opening at the initial attempt to seize or replace the container.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">It is an object of the instant invention to provide the user of a container holder of the aforementioned type, with a manually perceptible guide so that the hand can be directed exactly to the location of the pocket opening of the container holder, particularly when the manipulation is executed blindly.</p>
    <p num="7">Another object is to highlight the implemented guide function so that it becomes imprinted in the user's consciousness.</p>
    <p num="8">In order to achieve these ends, the container holder of the invention is the type having at least one pocket whose opening is directed upwardly, such pocket being adapted to contain the container, wherein a funnel-shaped container introduction neck, i.e., the widest portion of the neck, is arranged in the area of the pocket opening periphery, the most splayed portion of the neck being directed upwardly and outwardly.</p>
    <p num="9">According to one embodiment of the invention, the neck extends completely outside the pocket from the pocket opening periphery, thereby exposing its entire funnel shape.</p>
    <p num="10">According to another embodiment of the invention, the neck is fixed on the inside of the pocket, and is substantially set back from the pocket opening periphery, thereby only exposing the widest portion of its funnel shape.</p>
    <p num="11">
      By virtue of these arrangements, the user can locate the pocket opening simply by touch, i.e., without any visual aid.
      <br/>
      Indeed, as soon as the user brushes against the container introduction neck with his hand, or with the container that it is capable of holding, the position of the pocket opening becomes apparent.
      <br/>
      In addition, the funnel shape of the neck guides the hand and/or the container precisely up to the pocket opening.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In one embodiment, the pocket has a cylindrical contour, corresponding substantially to that of the container and is equipped with a support element for its connection with a belt.
      <br/>
      This support element is advantageously equipped with a comfort padding, for example, designed with a structure enabling air to circulate from the side directed towards the user, so as to allow both a pleasant contact with the user's waist as well as evacuation of perspiration.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In another embodiment, the pocket is closed laterally via the support element which is connected to the belt of the container holder.
      <br/>
      The canister introduction neck can therefore be obtained only on the pocket periphery.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The support element can have a variety of contours.
      <br/>
      For example, its contour can be defined by a triangle, one of whose sides is aligned with the belt, whereas the peak opposite that side is directed towards the ground.
      <br/>
      In addition, the pocket container holder can be positioned, with respect to the belt, such that it is in a vertical or diagonal position when the container holder is adjusted at the waist.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The invention will be better understood with reference to the attached schematic drawings illustrating, as non-restrictive examples, some embodiments of the canister holder.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a container holder that can be adjusted around the user's waist, made according to the invention, FIG. 1 representing it in an overall top view in its transportation position, and FIG. 2 showing the access zone to the container as seen from the top;
      <br/>
      FIGS. 3, 4, and 5 schematically illustrate various embodiments of the invention as applicable to container holders that can be adjusted around the user's waist.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      The container holder illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 is of the type that is adjusted onto the user's waist by means of a belt 2.
      <br/>
      It has a pocket 3 whose opening 5 is directed upwardly, and which is adapted to contain a container 4 in this embodiment, the pocket 3 is closed laterally on the side 15 that presses against the user by means of a downwardly pointing triangular support element 6, that ensures its connection with the belt 2.
      <br/>
      This support element 6 can have a variety of contours as long as it provides an adequate affixing zone for the pocket 3.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In order to minimize discomfort to the user's back, and in order to facilitate access to the opening 5 of the pocket 3, such pocket is advantageously placed diagonally on the support clement 6 with respect to the belt 2.
      <br/>
      More specifically, in the embodiment represented, the opening 5 of the pocket 3 is directed towards the right when the container holder is in the transportation position and placed on the user's back.
      <br/>
      The container holder that has a pocket 3 inclined in this manner is specifically intended for right handed users.
      <br/>
      The pocket 3 can also be placed diagonally in a way that its opening 5 is directed towards the left for left handed users.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Thus, with its right or left diagonal arrangement, the pocket 3 leaves a zone or portion 8 free of the support element 6 on the side opposite the one where it extends.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, this portion 8 is equipped with a flat pocket 9 having a zipper closure 10.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The opening 5 of the pocket 3 of the container holder is equipped with a neck for introducing the container 4.
      <br/>
      This funnel shaped introduction neck 7 is attached to the pocket 3 at a peripheral end portion of the pocket, i.e., in the area of the periphery 5' of the opening 5, and its most splayed part 7', i.e., the widest part of the neck 7, is directed upwardly and outwardly from the pocket 3.
      <br/>
      The introduction neck 7 is thereby upwardly and outwardly flared.
    </p>
    <p num="20">According to various embodiments, illustrated schematically with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the introduction neck 7 can extend completely outside the pocket 3 from the periphery 5' of the opening 5 thereof (FIG. 3), or have a narrow end 13 fixed substantially set back from said periphery 5', and preferably, towards the inside of the pocket 3 (FIG. 4) as represented in dotted and dashed lines.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Advantageously, the pocket 3 is equipped with a comfort padding 14 on the side 15 directed towards the user as is visible in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      This padding 14 is designed with a structure 14', constituted, for example, of a series of ribbings 14' allowing air to circulate and/or perspiration to be evacuated.
    </p>
    <p num="22">In order to prevent an accidental expulsion of the container 4 from the pocket 3, a necking 16, constituted for example, by a bellows, or pleated portion, with elastic lacing, is arranged to be set back from the widest part 7' of the introduction neck 7.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The canister holder as illustrated in FIG. 5 includes, as does the holder described above, a belt 2 connected to a support element 6 and a pocket 3, adapted to contain a container 4, which is equipped with an introduction neck 7.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the pocket 3 is arranged in a way so as to be approximately perpendicular to the belt 2.
      <br/>
      In this way, when the container holder is in tie transportation position on the user's waist, the container 4 remains in the vertical position.
    </p>
    <p num="24">It is to be understood that the container holder with a pocket 3 for the container 4 equipped with an introduction neck 7 can be made in other ways without, however, leaving the scope of the invention.</p>
    <p num="25">The neck 7 can be constituted of an attached piece or be integrated directly into the pocket.</p>
    <p num="26">For example, the pocket 3 can be fixed and/or attached directly on the belt 2 via stitches, adhesives, self-gripping textile structures, such as hook and loop fasteners, or in other manners etc.</p>
    <p num="27">The container holder can also have several pockets 3 adapted to contain containers 4 or any other equivalent containers, whether for liquids or for products having some consistency.</p>
    <p num="28">
      Finally, the container holder can be integrated directly into a back-pack or waist pack without leaving the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Indeed, in the embodiments cited, the belt 2 and/or the support element 6 for the pocket 3, are replaced by the pack itself with its carrying system.
