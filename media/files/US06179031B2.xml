      Apparatus for the gluing of two substrates in six processing steps for fabrication of a digital video disc including a motor-driven plate (2) for holding the first substrate (5), a glue dispenser disposed above the plate (2), grasping and holding device for providing vertical movement of the second substrate (7).
      <br/>
      The side of the plate turned toward the first substrate (5) has a radially outer plane portion (10) in the form of a disk concentric to its axis of rotation (R) and a radially inner portion (11) adjacent to this where the face (F) of this inner portion (11) turned toward the substrate (5) is formed by the outer face of a flat, straight frustum of a cone whose peak (S) strikes the axis of rotation (R) below the plane of application (E) of the substrate (5).
      <br/>
      In the transitional area from the annular portion (10) to the conical portion (11) an annular groove (12) running coaxially to the axis of rotation is cut into the plate (2) which is connected to a pressure source via channels (13, 13', . . . ) and corresponds to teardrop or finger-like indentations or recesses (14, 14', . . . ) in the conical portion (11) extending from the annular groove (12) radially inward.

    <heading>INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a process for the adhesion of a flat plastic substrate in the form of a circular disk to a like second substrate, for example for the fabrication of a digital video disc and apparatus for implementing the process.</p>
    <p num="2">
      A holding apparatus is known for the transport and processing of a flat substrate in the form of a circular disk (DE 295 12 381), in particular of a CD or CD-ROM, consisting of a housing with a central chamber which can be connected to a pressure source.
      <br/>
      A plurality of suction cups of an elastic material are connected to the chamber via suction channels and distributed over the chamber wall turned toward the substrate.
      <br/>
      Several dosing nozzles corresponding to a distribution channel are provided in the housing, ending approximately in the plane of the suction cups, and extending parallel to the suction channels where the distribution channel is provided with an attachment for connection to a paint source.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Furthermore an apparatus is known for the lacquering of a flat substrate in the form of a circular disk (DE 295 12 500), in particular a CD, which consists of a motordriven plate rotatable about a vertical axis for holding the substrate, a lacquer dispenser disposed above the plate which has an annular collar revolving with and enclosing the plate and partially connected to it with studs, and a positionally fixed housing with an annular edge part engaging the collar from outside.
      <br/>
      The collar is formed of two portions, of which the one portion is formed as a sleeve forming a straight frustum of a cone which, enclosing the plate, extends from its radially outer edge a bit upward.
      <br/>
      The other portion of the collar is formed as a sleeve forming a straight frustum of a cone which, enclosing the plate, extends from its radially outer edge downward so that the inner wall of the upper collar plate tapering upward collects particles of paint cast off in the radial direction and upward by the plate rotating about its vertical axis and lets them run off via recesses formed by the studs in the radial outer edge area of the plate at the inner wall of the lower portion of the collar tapering downward.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A process for the partial removal of thin layers of a substrate is also known (DE 42 02 194) in which a preferably plane surface of the substrate provided with a thin layer, for example a lacquer or metal layer or the like, is set in rotation about a perpendicular axis to the surface, and a solvent or etching agent is applied to the edge area of the surface which is cast off from the substrate by centrifugal force carrying with it the dissolved or etched off layer area.
      <br/>
      The surface of the layer area to be removed is at least partially masked by means of a template which possesses an inner contour corresponding to the layer to be removed and is disposed for the formation of a capillary at a small distance from the surface, that, with feeding of solvent or etching agent, the template is set in rotation synchronously with the substrate at a definite speed of revolution.
      <br/>
      After a definite time the feeding of solvent or etching agent is stopped and the solvent or etching agent along with the dissolved or etched off layer area is cast off at an appropriately increased speed of revolution.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Moreover an apparatus for grasping and holding a flat substrate, preferably in the form of a circular disk, with a central opening, for example a compact disc, is known (DE 195 29 945).
      <br/>
      It includes several finger-like grasping elements tiltably situated in the housing wherein the grasping elements are held and guided in openings or apertures in the head portion of the housing.
      <br/>
      This permits tilting motions of the grasping elements about axes transverse to the longitudinal axis of the housing, wherein the tilting axes of all grasping elements extend in one plane and form together one polygon enclosing the longitudinal axis.
      <br/>
      Magnets are fixedly disposed at each end of the grasping elements turned away from the substrate which work together with an electromagnet provided in the housing above the magnets whose magnetic field axis coincides with the longitudinal axis of the housing and which moves the ends of the grasping elements provided with magnets back and forth between two stops according to the polarity of the electromagnet.

      Finally an apparatus for the transport of digital video discs from initial stations formed as carousel transport apparatuses over several process stations to final stations has been proposed (DE 197 29 525.8) wherein the process stations cause the processing, for example, layering, checking, sorting, and gathering of the substrates and wherein grasping arms with grasping elements or suction lifters make possible the further transport of these substrates from station to station.
      <br/>
      A motor drive unit with a swivel apparatus and two lifting apparatuses are provided which can be driven separately and which work together with manipulators or grasping arms.
      <br/>
      The drive with grasping arms forming the conveyance station is disposed at the same distance from several stations, for example the preparation station, the lacquering/gluing station, the return conveyance station, and the testing station.
      <br/>
      The two lifting apparatuses of the motor drive unit simultaneously execute with their grasping arms the same and/or different lifting motions (vertical motions) and swiveling motions superimposed on these or subsequent to them.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      As shown in the drawings, and particularly FIGS. 7 and 8, the apparatus of the present invention features the side of the plate (2) turned toward the first substrate (5) with a radially outer plane portion (10) in the form of a disk concentric to its axis of rotation and a radial inner portion (11) adjacent to this, where the face (F) of this inner portion (11) turned toward the substrate (5) is formed by the outer face of a flat, straight frustum of a cone.
      <br/>
      The peak (S) thereof strikes the axis of rotation below the plane of application (E) of the substrate (5).
      <br/>
      In the transitional area from the annular portion (10) to the conical portion (11) an annular groove (12) running coaxially to the axis of rotation is cut into the plate (2) which on the one side is connected to the pressure source via channels (13, 13', . . . ) running in the plate and on the other side corresponds to teardrop or finger-like indentations or recesses (14, 14', . . . ) in the conical face (F) extending from the annular groove (12) radially inward.
      <br/>
      The diameter and the depth of the annular groove (12) are approximately dimensioned so that they correspond to the annular protuberance (9) of the substrate (5).
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The plate 2 is coupled rotationally fixed to the shaft 3 of a motor drive unit and can be turned by it about the vertical axis of rotation R. The nozzle 4 of an apparatus for the dosed application of adhesive 6 into the area of the first substrate 5 can be moved in from the side whereby the application of adhesive is performed during a slow rotation of the plate 2.
      <br/>
      After the application of the predetermined amount of adhesive 6 in the form of an adhesive ring (FIG. 3) the second substrate 7 is moved down from above toward the first substrate 5 in the direction of the arrow A and in fact until a small distance between the two substrates 5 and 7 still remains and the adhesive is distributed in the gap remaining between both substrates 5, 7.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows that the second substrate 7 is pushed to a very small degree by the grasping apparatus 8 toward the first substrate 5 whereby a small amount of excess adhesive from the gap formed by the substrates 5, 7 exits.
      <br/>
      After the release of the second substrate 7 from the grasping apparatus 8 the excess adhesive is cast off radially by a rapid turning motion.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The plate 2 has on its side turned away from the substrate 5 a plane face 10 in the form of a circular disk to which a conical indentation is adjacent radially inward, where the conical portion 11 is disposed concentrically to the axis of rotation R. The portion 11 is formed by the outer face of a very flat frustum of a cone, where the peak 5 of this frustum of a cone strikes the axis of rotation R below the plane E. The substrate 5 in the form of a circular disk has an annular protuberance 9 for which a correspondingly dimensioned annular groove 12 is cut in the plate 2, which for its part is connected via channels 13, 13', . . . to a vacuum source.
      <br/>
      On the radially inner edge of the annular groove, 12 finger-like or teardrop flattenings 14, 14', . . . are provided so that, with the substrate 5 lying on the portion 10, the radially inward lying portion 11 of the substrate 5 is drawn downward by the pressure in the gap between the underside of the substrate and the face F or the flattenings 14, 14', . . . whereby the portion 11 of the substrate 5 is conically deformed so that the adhesive 6 experiences an unhindered expansion radially inward and a sharply contoured break-away of the adhesive results.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In carrying out the process of the invention, a flat plastic substrate (5) in the form of a circular disk is adhered to a like second substrate (7) for a digital video disc with a motor-driven plate (2) rotatable about a vertical axis (R) for holding the first substrate (5), using an adhesive dispenser (4) disposed above the plate (5).
      <br/>
      Dispenser (4) is provided with a nozzle for a portioned issue of adhesive (6).
      <br/>
      An apparatus (8) is provided for grasping, holding, and providing vertical movement of the second substrate (7) from a position above the plane of the adhesive dispenser (4) to the position of the first substrate (5).
      <br/>
      A series of processing steps is carried out, where in one processing step, the glue dispenser (4) is moved in the direction toward the axis of rotation (R) of the plate (2) holding the first substrate (5) until the nozzle is aligned approximately to a middle zone of the substrate (5).
      <br/>
      In a second processing step, a predetermined amount of adhesive (6) is issued from the nozzle onto the 20 substrate (5) during which the plate (2) executes a turning motion.
      <br/>
      In a third processing step, after the withdrawal of the adhesive dispenser (4) from the area of the substrate (5), the second substrate (7) is lowered by the grasping and holding apparatus (8) toward the first substrate (5) until a predetermined narrow gap between both substrates (5 and 7) remains and the adhesive (6) is distributed over the upper side of the first substrate (5).
      <br/>
      After a short dwelltime, in a fourth processing step, the grasping and holding apparatus (8) moves toward the first substrate (5) until both substrates (5 and 7) lie firmly on one another.
      <br/>
      Then in a fifth processing step the grasping and holding apparatus (8) is released from the second substrate (7) and moved back to its starting position and both substrates (5 and 7) adhered to one another are set in rapid rotation by the plate for a short time for the removal of the excess adhesive.
      <br/>
      Finally, in a sixth processing step, both substrates (5 and 7) aligned to one another are fed to a UV dryer (9).
      <br/>
      An conventional and suitable adhesive can be used for purposes of this invention as will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
