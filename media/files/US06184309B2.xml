    <p num="2">The present invention relates to processes for removing protecting groups from protected functionalized polymers.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Mono- and di-functional polymers (i.e., telechelic polymers that contain two functional groups per molecule at the termini of the polymer) have found wide utility in many applications.
      <br/>
      For instance, telechelic polymers have been employed as rocket fuel binders, in coatings and sealants and in adhesives.
      <br/>
      In addition, polymers that contain two hydroxyl groups per molecule can be co-polymerized with appropriate materials to form polyesters, polycarbonates, and polyamides (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,994,526).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A variety of polymerization techniques, such as cationic and free radical polymerizations, have been employed to prepare functional polymers.
      <br/>
      However, functionality can be best controlled with anionic polymerization.
      <br/>
      Living anionic polymerization of styrene and diene monomers were first described by Szwarc and his coworkers.
      <br/>
      See M. Szwarc, Nature 178, 1169 (1956) and M. Szwarc, et al., J.Am.Chem.Soc. 78, 2656 (1956).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Various publications have discussed the use of protected functional initiators to provide telechelic polymers.
      <br/>
      An early approach to the preparation of telechelic polymers is discussed in D. N. Schulz, et al., J.Polym.Sci., Polym.Chem.Ed. 12, 153 (1974), which describes the reaction of a protected hydroxy initiator with butadiene.
      <br/>
      The resultant living anion was quenched with ethylene oxide to afford mono-protected di-hydroxy polybutadiene.
      <br/>
      While excellent functionality (f=1.87-2.02) was achieved by this process, the protected initiator was insoluble in hydrocarbon solution.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the reaction was conducted in diethyl ether, and as a result, relatively high 1,2 microstructure (31-54%) was obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,331,058 and 5,362,699 to Shepherd, et al. discuss the preparation of telechelic polymers in hydrocarbon solutions using monofunctional silyl ether initiators.
      <br/>
      These monofunctional silyl ether initiators can be useful in producing dihydroxy (telechelic) polybutadienes having desirable characteristics, such as a molecular weight of typically 1,000 to 10,000, a 1,4 microstructure content of typically 90%, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      These and other anionic polymerization techniques, and in particular those using protected functional initiators, can be useful for the preparation of protected functional polymers.
      <br/>
      However, problems have been encountered in deprotecting or removing the protecting group from functional polymer moieties.
      <br/>
      Typically, prior deprotecting processes can require the use of costly reagents, result in partial or essentially no cleavage of the protecting group, lack economic feasibility in commercial production (for example, require high temperatures, long reaction times, etc.), alter the polymer structure, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,331,058 and 5,362,699 discuss the use of tetraalkylammonium fluorides in polar solvents as useful desilylation reagents.
      <br/>
      However, tetraalkylammonium fluoride reagents can be costly and difficult to handle due to their toxicity (see discussion in U.S. Pat. No. 5,376,745).
      <br/>
      Further, it can be difficult to effectively remove the silyl protecting groups of these types of initiators using tetraalkylammonium fluoride, and other, reagents.
      <br/>
      Other reagents, such as tert-butyldimethylsilyl triflate, can alter the polymer structure.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention provides processes for deprotecting functionalized polymers, including mono- and di-functional polymers and functionalized multi-branched or star polymers.
      <br/>
      In the invention, the protected functionalized polymer is treated in the presence of an acid catalyst under conditions selected to remove at least one protecting group.
      <br/>
      Exemplary acid catalysts useful in the present invention include organic acids, mineral acids, heterogeneous acid systems, Lewis acids and fluoride ion sources.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The process of the invention is capable of being conducted at a variety of temperatures and processing times, ranging from ambient to about 200 (degree)  C., and from about one hour to about 24 hours, thus imparting flexibilty to the deprotection process.
      <br/>
      Further, protected functionalized polymers can be effectively deprotected in accordance with the invention using relatively mild conditions and with minimal or no structural changes in the polymer.
      <br/>
      The process of the invention can also offer economies of production, including reduced reaction times, temperatures, lower reagent costs, and the like.
      <br/>
      Still further, deprotection conditions can also be selected to provide selected deprotection of dissimilar protecting groups, or to provide partial deprotection, as desired.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      The processes of the present invention are useful for deprotecting functionalized polymers, including mono- and di-functional polymers and functionalized multi-branched or star polymers.
      <br/>
      Polymers which can be deprotected in accordance with the present invention can be represented by the following general formulas:
      <br/>
      FG-(Q)d --Rn --Z--J-�A(R1 R2 R3)�)  (I)
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      or
      <br/>
      L�(Q)d --Rn --Z--J-�A(R1 R2 R3)�x �m (II)
    </p>
    <p num="13">wherein FG is H or a protected or non-protected functional group; Q is a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbyl group derived by incorporation of a compound selected from group consisting of conjugated diene hydrocarbons, alkenylsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons, polar compounds, and mixtures thereof; d is an integer from 10 to 2000; R is a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbyl group derived by incorporation of a compound selected from the group consisting of conjugated diene hydrocarbons, alkenylsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures thereof; n is an integer from 0 to 5; Z is a branched or straight chain hydrocarbon group which contains 3-25 carbon atoms, optionally containing aryl or substituted aryl groups; J is oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen; �A(R1 R2 R3)�x is a protecting group, in which A is an element selected from Group IVa of the Periodic Table of Elements; R1, R2, and R3 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl groups containing lower alkyl, lower alkylthio, and lower dialkylamino groups, aryl or substituted aryl groups containing lower alkyl, lower alkylthio, and lower dialkylamino groups, and cycloalkyl and substituted cycloalkyl containing 5 to 12 carbon atoms; and x is dependent on the valence of J and varies from one when J is oxygen or sulfur to two when J is nitrogen; L in Formula II is a linking or coupling agent, as described below; and m can be an integer from 3 to 50.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In the present invention, a polymer as represented by Formulas (I) or (II) above is treated with an acid catalyst which is suitable for removing or cleaving the protecting group �A(R1 R2 R3)�x.
      <br/>
      The process of the invention is particularly useful for the removal of alkyl ether protecting groups wherein J is oxygen and A is carbon, although the invention is not limited to removal of these groups.
    </p>
    <p num="15">The acid catalyst employed in accordance with the invention is generally selected from the group consisting of organic acids (including without limitation para-toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, acetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, and the like), dilute mineral acids (including without limitation hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and the like, having a concentration between about 0.01 N and about 12 N), heterogeneous acid systems (including without limitation acid ion exchange resins, such as Amberlyst.RTM. 15, a commercially available polystyrene-based resin with sulfonic acid groups, Dowex.RTM. 50, a commercially available polystyrene-based resin from Dow Chemical, Reillex.RTM. 425 HCl, a commercially available polyvinyl pyridine-based resin from Reilly Tar and Chemical, acid clays, and the like), Lewis acids (including without limitation trimethylsilyl iodide, iron (III) chloride with acetic anhydride, boron trihalides, such as boron trifluoride, and the like) and suitable sources of fluoride ions, such as tetraalkylammonium fluoride, such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride, potassium fluoride, sodium fluoride, cesium fluoride, lithium fluoride, lithium tetrafluoroborate, hydrogen fluoride, pyridine hydrogen fluoride complex, and the like.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The polymers of Formulas (I) and (II) can be treated under a variety of conditions to deprotect the same.
      <br/>
      Reaction conditions can vary, depending, for example, on the type of acid catalyst employed, the protecting group to be removed, the degree of deprotection required, the presence of different protecting groups, and the like.
      <br/>
      Generally, the deprotecting reaction is conducted at a temperature ranging from about ambient (about 20 (degree)  C.) to about 200 (degree)  C., although higher or lower temperatures can also be used.
      <br/>
      Reaction times can also vary, and typically range from about 1 hour to 24 hours, although again higher or lower times can be used.
      <br/>
      The progress of the deprotection reactions can be monitored by conventional analytical techniques, such as Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), or InfraRed (IR) spectroscopy.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      For example, organic acids, mineral acids, Lewis acids and fluoride ion sources can generally be used in polar or hydrocarbon solvents, or mixtures thereof, to deprotect the polymers of Formulas (I) and (II) at temperatures ranging from ambient to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      The organic acids, mineral acids, Lewis acids, and fluoride ion sources may also be used in excess amounts as solvents in the deprotection process.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Protected functional polymers can be effectively deprotected using heterogeneous acid systems without solvent, for example, by treating the polymer with particles of an acidic ion exchange resin or other heterogeneous acid systems and heat.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the protected functional polymer can be deprotected by heating the polymer with a hydrocarbon based two phase solution of the heterogeneous acid system up to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      The use of neat acidic ion exchange resins, and other heterogeneous acid systems, can be particularly advantageous in commercial production because of the relative ease and efficiency of use (for example as a fluidized bed of acid catalyst particles, through which the polymer to be deprotected is contacted).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Hydrocarbon solvents useful in practicing this invention include, but are not limited to, inert liquid alkanes, cycloalkanes and aromatic solvents such as alkanes and cycloalkanes containing five to ten carbon atoms, such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, heptane, methylcycloheptane, octane, decane and the like, and aromatic solvents containing six to ten carbon atoms such as toluene, ethylbenzene, p-xylene, m-xylene, o-xylene, n-propylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, n-butylbenzene, t-butylbenzene, and the like.
      <br/>
      Useful polar solvents include, but are not limited to, diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, methyl tert-butyl ether, diazabicyclo�2.2.2�octane, triethylamine, tributylamine, N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylene diamine (TMEDA), 1,2-dimethoxyethane (glyme), alkali metal alkoxides and amino-substituted alkali metal alkoxides.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      When FG is H, the resultant deprotected polymer is mono-functional, i.e., has a hydroxyl, thio or amino functionality when J is oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen, respectively.
      <br/>
      FG can also be a functional group to provide a di-functional polymer.
      <br/>
      The di-functional polymer may be telechelic, i.e., contain two functional groups which are the same per molecule at the termini of the polymer (FG and J are the same).
      <br/>
      The polymer can also be hetero-telechelic, having different functionalities at opposite ends of the polymer chain (FG and J are not the same).
      <br/>
      Further, FG can be protected or non-protected; when FG is protected, the FG protecting group can be the same or different from the �A(R1 R2 R3)�x protecting group.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The present invention also provides selective deprotection of functional groups of a polymer or mixtures of polymers.
      <br/>
      In this regard, deprotecting conditions can be selected to remove at least one protecting group without removing other dissimilar protecting groups, by proper selection of deprotecting reagents and conditions.
      <br/>
      For example, when polymer (I) includes a protected functional group FG as defined above in addition to protecting group �A(R1 R2 R3)�x, the polymer of Formula (I) can be treated using the acid catalysts under conditions to selectively remove one or both of the protecting groups.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a mixture of polymers according to Formulas (I) or (II) having different protecting groups �A(R1 R2 R1)�x, and/or protecting groups on the functional group FG which are the same or different from the protecting groups �A(R1 R2 R3)�x, can also be treated using the acid catalysts under conditions to selectively remove one or more of the protecting groups.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The following table details representative experimental conditions capable of selectively removing protecting groups (more labile) while maintaining the integrity of other different protecting groups (more stable).</p>

      <br/>
      -- trimethylsilyl     dialkylamino  tetrabutylammonium fluoride
      <br/>
      -- trimethylsilyl     dialkylamino  1N HCl
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Still further, the degree or amount of deprotection can also be controlled in accordance with the present invention by suitable selection of deprotecting reaction conditions, acid catalyst, and the like.
      <br/>
      In this regard, various reaction conditions and/or acid catalysts can be useful to partially deprotect the functional groups.
      <br/>
      For example, trifluoroacetic acid and trimethylsilyl iodide can be effective in partially deprotecting tertiary alkyl ether protecting groups.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The polymers of Formulas (I) or (II) can be prepared by initiating polymerization of suitable compounds in a polar, hydrocarbon, or mixed hydrocarbon-polar solvent medium with a protected functional organolithium initiator to form an intermediate mono-protected mono-functional living anion.
      <br/>
      For polar compounds, preferably, the initiator is reacted with an appropriate diphenyl alkyl group, such as 1,1-diphenylethylene, to provide a stabilized carbanion prior to polymerization.
    </p>
    <p num="26">The monomers may be polymerized singly, or in admixture with each other to form tapered or random copolymers, or by charging the compounds to the reaction mixture sequentially, to form block copolymers.</p>
    <p num="27">
      As noted above, the mono-protected mono-functional living anion can be quenched with a suitable proton donor, such as methanol, isopropanol, acetic acid, and the like, to provide a mono-functional polymer (wherein FG is H).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, polymerization can be followed by functionalization of the resultant living anion with a suitable electrophile to provide a di-functional polymer.
      <br/>
      The di-functional polymer may be telechelic, i.e., contain two functional groups, which are the same, per molecule at the termini of the polymer.
      <br/>
      The polymer can also be hetero-telechelic, having different functionalities at opposite ends of the polymer chain.
      <br/>
      This is represented schematically by the formula A - - - B, wherein A and B are different functional groups.

      Non-polar compounds are preferably polymerized in a non-polar solvent such as a hydrocarbon (as described above), since anionic polymerization in the presence of such non-polar solvents is known to produce polyenes with high 1,4-contents from 1,3-dienes.
      <br/>
      Polar solvents (modifiers) can be added to the polymerization reaction to alter the microstructure of the resulting polymer, i.e., increase the proportion of 1,2 (vinyl) microstructure or to promote functionalization or randomization.
      <br/>
      The amount of the polar modifier added depends on the vinyl content desired, the nature of the monomer, the temperature of the polymerization, and the identity of the polar modifier.
      <br/>
      For polar monomers, preferred polymerization solvents are polar solvents, although a hydrocarbon, or mixtures of polar and hydrocarbon solvents can also be used.

      The polymers of Formulas (I) or (II) can optionally be hydrogenated, either before or after deprotection.
      <br/>
      Suitable hydrogenation techniques are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,970,254, 5,166,277, 5,393,843 and 5,496,898, the entire disclosure of each of which is incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      The hydrogenation of the functionalized polymer is conducted in situ, or in a suitable solvent, such as hexane, cyclohexane or heptane.
      <br/>
      This solution is contacted with hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst, such as a nickel catalyst.
      <br/>
      The hydrogenation is typically performed at temperatures from 25 (degree)  C. to 150 (degree)  C., with a archetypal hydrogen pressure of 15 psig to 1000 psig.
      <br/>
      The progress of this hydrogenation can be monitored by InfraRed (IR) spectroscopy or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
      <br/>
      The hydrogenation reaction is conducted until at least 90% of the aliphatic unsaturation has been saturated.
      <br/>
      The hydrogenated functional polymer is then recovered by conventional procedures, such as removal of the catalyst with aqueous acid wash, followed by solvent removal or precipitation of the polymer.

      Functionalized polymers of Formulas (I) or (II) can be further reacted with other comonomers, such as di or polyesters, di- or polyiisocyanates, di-, poly-, or cyclic amides, di- and polycarboxylic acids, and di- and polyols.
      <br/>
      For example, a protected functional polymer can be treated using the acid catalysts as described above in the presence of a suitable comonomer to simultaneously deprotect the functional polymer and polymerize the functional end(s) thereof to produce novel segmented block polymers.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, deprotecting conditions can be selected so as to copolymerize one functional end thereof with a suitable comonomer while maintaining the integrity of the other protecting group to provide a functional block copolymer.
      <br/>
      Still another alternative is to remove the protecting group of the functional polymer of Formulas (I) or (II) and to polymerize a functional block copolymer of the preceding sentence with the same or other comonomers to produce novel segmented block polymers.

    <p num="62">
      Still further, as noted above, multi-branched or star-shaped polymers with protected functional groups, or their optionally hydrogenated analogues, can also be deprotected in accordance with the process of the invention.
      <br/>
      Star polymers can be produced using the functional initiators (III) described above (singly or combinations-thereof), which, by design, incorporate the versatility of functional branch ends in the star polymers.
      <br/>
      For example, hydroxy-, thio-, or amino-terminated functional branches can be copolymerized with comonomers, such as organic diacids (such as carboxylic acids), diisocyanates, and the like.
      <br/>
      The copolymers can also include non-functional branches in the polymer.
      <br/>
      This can provide improved impact resistance in molecules resulting from further copolymerization of the star-shaped polymers with other functional comonomers, for example, resultant polyester and/or polyamide molecules.
    </p>

      Novel multi-branched or star-shaped polymers having functional ends can be produced by polymerizing alkenylsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons, conjugated dienes, and polar compounds, singly, sequentially, or as mixtures thereof, as described above, with protected functional organolithium initiators of Formula (III) (singly or as combinations thereof to provide arms having different protecting groups and/or different functional groups), and subsequently reacting the resulting copolymer with multifunctional linking agents.

      <br/>
      Mixtures of coupling agents can also be used.

    <p num="66">
      Alternatively, novel multi-branched or star-shaped polymers possessing functional ends which may be the same or different, and/or both functional and non-functional ends, may be produced by separately polymerizing alkenylsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons, conjugated dienes, or polar monomers, as described above, with protected functional initiators (III) and/or with non-functional organolithium initiators, subsequently mixing the resulting separately produced anions, treating the resulting mixture with multifunctional linking agents, and optionally hydrogenating before or after optionally deprotecting the functional ends of the polymer.
      <br/>
      This alternative method allows for control of the molecular weight of the arms of the star polymer (for example, different polymer anion chain lengths can be produced) and provides for a more selective control of the physical properties of the resultant polymers.

      Additionally, the process of the invention is useful for deprotecting a wide variety of symmetrically or asymmetrically functional polymers produced by reacting the living polymers described above with various functionalizing agents.
      <br/>
      For example, addition of carbon dioxide (see J.Polym.Sci., Polym.Chem. 30, 2349 (1992)) to a living polymer having a protected hydroxyl group would produce a polymer with one protected hydroxyl and one carboxyl group, or the living polymer may be reacted with 1,5 diazabicyclo-(3.1.0) hexane as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,753,991 to produce a polymer with one protected hydroxyl and one amino group.
      <br/>
      A polymer with one protected hydroxyl group and one protected amino group can be prepared by reaction of the living anion with a protected amino propyl bromide, see Macromolecules, 23, 939 (1990).
      <br/>
      Reaction of the living polymer anion with oxetane or substituted oxetanes (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,637) would afford a polymer which contained one protected hydroxyl and a hydroxyl group.
      <br/>
      A polymer with two protected hydroxyl groups can be prepared by reaction of the living anion with a silicon derived acetal, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,899.

    <p num="70">
      Other polymers which can be deprotected in accordance with the present invention include asymmetrically substituted monofunctional polymers having epoxy or isocyanate groups at one end, for example, by reacting the lithium salt of the living polymers described above having a protected hydroxyl group (before hydrolysis), with epichlorohydrin or by reacting the lithium salt itself with an equivalent of a diisocyanate, such as methylene 4,4-diphenyl diisocyanate (2/1 NCO/OH).
      <br/>
      These unsymmetrically substituted functional polymers could then be further reacted with other comonomers either with or without simultaneous deprotection as described below.

    <p num="71">Protected dihydroxy polymers alone and in their hydrogenated forms could be used as base materials to lend flexibility and higher impact strength in a number of formulas to produce coatings, sealants, binders and block copolymers with polyesters, polyamides and polycarbonates as described in UK Patent Application GB2270317A and in "Polytail" data sheets and brochures (Mitsubishi Kasei America).</p>
    <p num="72">In the presence of acidic catalysts used to promote the formation of many of these block copolymer resins, the protecting group of the hydrogenated polymer is removed as well, allowing the exposed hydroxyl grouping in the base polymer molecule to simultaneously participate in the block copolymer reaction.</p>

      For example, hydrogenated polymers may be reacted with bisphenol A and phosgene in the presence of appropriate catalysts with simultaneous deprotection to yield a polycarbonate alternating block copolymer.

      <br/>
      Inclusion of acid functional diols, such as dimethylolpropionic acid, in the polyurethane introduces pendant carboxyl groups which can be neutralized with tertiary amines to afford water dispersable polyolefin/polyurethane segmented polymers, useful for water based coatings.
      <br/>
      This same principle could be applied to acrylic polymers made with tertiary amine functional monomers included, which could be made by free radical polymerization following reacting the hydroxyl groups at the terminal ends of the polymer with acryloyl chloride or methacryloyl chloride.

      Another likely application for functionally terminated polymers include use as viscosity index (V.I.) improvers.

      Using carboxyl functional monomers, such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, and/or amine functional monomers such as acrylamide, along with free radical initiators in further polymerizations, can result in the formation of polymer segments at the periphery of each termini with amine or other functionalities which, in addition to the advantageous properties of the polymers as V.I. improvers, combines the ability to add functionality to the polymers for dispersant properties (see, for example, U.S. Pat.

      The versatility of the hydroxyl functional polymers of this invention, and the wide range of different segmented polymers (polyethers, polyesters, polyamides, polycarbonates, polyurethanes, etc.) which can be initiated at the hydroxyl groups, leads to numerous possible applications as compatibilizers for polymer blends and alloys.
      <br/>
      In addition to the use of such blends for new applications, much recent interest is generated in the use of compatibilizers to facilitate polymer waste recycling.

      The polar functional groups on the polymer chain ends allow the polymers of this invention to alter the surface properties of polymers like polyethylene (including high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, and linear low density polyethylene), polypropylene, polyisobutylene and copolymers and blends thereof.
      <br/>
      When the polymers of this invention are blended with non-polar polyolefins, the polar functional groups on the chain ends, being incompatible with the non-polar polyolefin, will phase separate and migrate to the surface of the polyolefin.

      The polymers of the invention can be added to the polyolefin in amounts from 1 to 25% by weight based on the weight of the polyolefin.

      Properties such as surface adhesion are thus greatly enhanced, leading to improved adhesion of pigments in printing inks for labels, composite layering, and other adhesive applications.
      <br/>
      An alternative approach to modification of polymer surfaces to alter properties by introduction of functional groups has been the use of chemical reagents such as alkyllithiums (see, for example, A. J. Dias, K-W Lee, and T. J. McCarthy, Rubber &amp; Plastics News, 18-20, Oct. 31, 1988, and A. J. Dias and T. J. McCarthy, Macromolecules, 20, 1437 (1987)).

No. 5,278,244, which may then be further polymerized by a variety of techniques to yield "comb" polymers which, on deprotection and hydrogenation yield branched polymers with, for example, hydroxyfunctionality on the branch-ends.
      <br/>
      Such multi-functionality can be utilized to graft a water-soluble polymer such as polyethylene oxide onto a hydrophobic polyolefinic core to produce hydrogels.
