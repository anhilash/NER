      <br/>
      A cylindrical chamber has a drive shaft rotatably mounted therein and extending along substantially the entire longitudinal extent thereof.
      <br/>
      This drive shaft is rotatably driven by a motor at a speed of 1,500-10,000 rpm.
      <br/>
      Solid particles to be comminuted which may be of coal, limestone/dolomite, cement or lime are fed into the chamber.
      <br/>
      Pressurized air is fed into the bottom of the chamber.
      <br/>
      Uplifting pressure for driving the gas and particles upwardly in the chamber may be provided by pressurized gas fed in through a tangential inlet in conjunction with a stationary velocity head.
      <br/>
      The upwardly driven particles are first driven through a plurality of short arm rotors which are driven by the shaft and provide a centrifugal force which comminutes the particles.
      <br/>
      The particles are then driven through a plurality of semi-permeable screens which are rotatably driven by the shaft and further comminute the particles.
      <br/>
      High apex flow enhancers are installed along the walls of the chamber to enhance the fluid flow.
      <br/>
      The fully comminuted particles are expelled from the top end of the chamber.

      Micronized coal is used as an energy source in the generation of electricity and micronized limestone/dolomite or lime are used for environmental compliance in the flue gas cleanup of power plants.
      <br/>
      Micronized coal burns with a flame velocity similar to natural gas or fuel oil and with a short flame that allows the heat energy generated in the combustion to be readily transferred to the water walls of the boiler.
      <br/>
      This results in an increased boiler rating and less heat losses through the ducts and flue stack.
      <br/>
      In addition to providing a more complete combustion, the micronized coal upon combustion yields a micronized fly ash with low carbon content which is of considerable value in the construction industry as a substitute for cement in high strength concrete formulations.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In addition the combustion of micronized coal requires no excess air and results in minimized NOx in the flue gases.
      <br/>
      Micronized limestone, dolomite or hydrated lime are most valuable in the dry hot scrubbing of flue gases and affords a more effective aqueous scrubbing thereof as these particles have much larger reactive surfaces for the SOx and NOx scrubbing.
      <br/>
      This results in a more complete utilization of the sorbents resulting in substantial savings in the flue gas clean up section of a power plant in conforming to the requirements of the Clean Air Act.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The use of micronized coal and limestone/dolomite or lime as the fuel for generating electric power thus has significant advantages over the use of conventional fuels such as fuel oil or non-micronized coal and is much less expensive than natural gas.</p>

      In my U.S Pat. No. 5,695,130 issued Dec. 9, 1997, a grinding system is described in which rotating screens with wide mesh openings are first used to comminute particulate material through spiral vortexes and such comminuted material is then fed to circular vortexes formed between rotating discs and stationary plates where the final grinding of the particulate material is accomplished and the final comminuted material is separated from the gas streams by centrifugal fans.
      <br/>
      The system and method of the present invention applies the basic technology of my prior patent in implementing the micronization of solid particles such as coal, limestone/dolomite, lime, and cement.
      <br/>
      The system of the present invention provides an improvement over the system of my prior patent in minimizing the erosion of the fan blades employed and lowering the system power requirements.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">The device and method of the present invention achieves the above indicated improvements by providing a pressurized air drive for driving the particles upwardly along with high apex flow enhancers so that a fan for achieving this end result is not required and designing the rotors with short arms so that they do not impact on the particles but rather generate kinetic energy in the form of centrifugal vortices in the air stream.</p>
    <p num="10">
      In the system of the invention, pressurized air is fed into the bottom of a chamber into which the particles to be comminuted are fed.
      <br/>
      Uplift action is provided by means of a stationary velocity head in the form of an inverted semi-ellipsoidal tank.
      <br/>
      The particles are first comminuted by a series of short arm rotors designed to generate centrifugal vortices in the uplifting air which effect the comminuting action.
      <br/>
      Such short arm rotors have the advantages of minimizing wear and tear on the rotor blades and enabling higher operation efficiency since the particles are driven outwardly by the centrifugal force generated in the air stream and tend not to impact on the rotor blades.
      <br/>
      Further, with shorter arm rotors, the fluid bed volume is expanded.
      <br/>
      Flow enhancers in the form of vertical apex elements mounted on the inner walls of the chamber enhance the flow of gas along the walls of the chamber.
      <br/>
      The particles are then passed through a series of semi-permeable rotating screens which further effect the comminuting action.
      <br/>
      The fully comminuted particles are then driven out of the chamber to a collecting cyclone by the gas stream.
    </p>
    <p num="11">It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a system and method for comminuting particles which consumes less power and results in less wear on the fan blades employed.</p>
    <p num="12">It is a further object of this invention to provide a system and method for comminuting particles having higher operation efficiency;</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">Referring now to FIGS. 1-11, a first embodiment of the invention is illustrated.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Chamber 11 which is cylindrical is maintained in an air tight condition.
      <br/>
      The walls 12 of the chamber are lined with a material such as rubber or neoprene.
      <br/>
      Drive shaft 13 is mounted for rotation within the chamber on bearings 14 and is rotatably driven by motor 15 through belt drive 16 preferably at a speed of 3000-5000 rpm.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Connected to shaft 13 for rotation therewith are rotating plate fan 17, rotors 18a-18d and semipermeable screens 19a-19d.
      <br/>
      Fan 17, as can be seen in FIGS. 10 and 11 has curved blades 17a and drives particles which may fall to the bottom sideways into the uplifting airstream for regrinding.
      <br/>
      High apex flow enhancers 40 which are triangular in cross section are installed along the inner walls of the chamber, running vertically therealong and act to enhance the flow of gas along the walls of the chamber.
      <br/>
      Stationary velocity head 43, which has the shape of a semi-ellipsoidal tank is installed at the bottom of the chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Solid particles which may be of coal, cement clinker, or limestone on the order of 1/4" in diameter which may have a surface moisture content of 2-10% are fed from a feed hopper(not shown) by means of a screw feeder (not shown) into feed channel 23.</p>
    <p num="19">
      Pressurized gas(preferably air) is fed from inlet tubing 25 through a pair of ports 25a and 25b into the bottom of the chamber.
      <br/>
      The pressurized air is distributed upwardly by velocity head 43 in the form of an annulus providing a uniform air curtain directed upwardly along the inner wall of chamber 11.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Rotors 18a-18d are shown in FIGS. 6-8. The rotor blades 30 are vertical and are angled with respect to the longitudinal axis of rotor arms 31 by an angle of about sixty degrees.
      <br/>
      The blades are connected to shaft 13 by means of shaft attachment 32.
      <br/>
      The rotor arms are quite short and the design of the rotors is such that they do not impact on the particles in the fluid bed but rather transmit the kinetic energy which they generate into the air stream between the rotor blades and the inner wall of the chamber which performs the comminuting action by virtue of the centrifugal forces generated in this air stream.
      <br/>
      The rotors are shown installed in chamber 11 in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      High apex flow enhancers 40 which extend vertically, as shown in FIG. 1, enhance the flow of the air stream along the inner surfaces of the chamber.
      <br/>
      As the particles decrease in size, the effect of the centrifugal forces decreases, and the flow dynamics carries the reduced size particles towards the rotating semi permeable screens 19a-19d.
      <br/>
      The slower moving larger particles are repulsed by the screens and driven back down for regrinding.
      <br/>
      The smaller particles which pass through the screens are exposed to the vertical spiral air vortexes created by the rotating screens.
      <br/>
      The comminuted particles are expelled to a collecting cyclone through outlet 35.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The structure of the semi permeable screens is illustrated in FIGS. 3-5. Wire screens 37, which are preferably about 4 mesh, are sandwiched between holder frames 38a and 38b, these holder frames being coupled to drive shaft 13 by means of shaft attachment 39.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows one of the screens installed in the chamber 11.
      <br/>
      Vertical flow enhancers 40 (also shown in FIG. 1) are installed in the walls of the chamber to enhance the flow of fluid.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Referring now to FIGS. 12 and 13, a second embodiment of the invention is shown.
      <br/>
      This second embodiment is the same as the first except for the addition of an additional section to the bottom of the chamber in which a tangential inlet is installed that makes for a circular flow.
      <br/>
      Pressurized air is fed into the bottom of the chamber by means of a forced draft fan(not shown) through tangential inlets 50.
      <br/>
      With such tangential feeding of the pressurized air into the chamber, a high velocity spiral swirl of the air stream is effected along the inner wall of chamber 11.
      <br/>
      There thus is a circular flow between the flow enhancers 40.
      <br/>
      An even radial velocity distribution results throughout the rest of the chamber.
      <br/>
      This provides a denser fluid bed which makes for improved comminution and less power consumption.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Referring now to FIGS. 15-17, a third embodiment of the invention is shown.
      <br/>
      This embodiment differs from the second embodiment in the substitution of a dome head cover 50 above the stationary velocity head 43 for the rotating plate for use in upwardly driving particles falling to the bottom so they can be reground.
      <br/>
      In addition, extra high flow enhancers 40 which are elongated and have narrow bases, as shown in FIG. 16, are employed.
      <br/>
      Otherwise this embodiment is the same as the second embodiment.
    </p>
