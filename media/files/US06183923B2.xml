    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a lithographic printing plate precursor and a method for preparing a lithographic printing plate using the printing plate precursor and, more particularly, to a lithographic printing plate precursor capable of providing a printing plate which enables to print a great number of printed matter having clear images free from background stains and a method for preparing a lithographic printing plate using the printing plate precursor.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">Lithographic printing plate precursors which are used mainly in the filed of small-scale commercial printing include (1) a direct drawing type printing plate precursor having a hydrophilic image-receiving layer provided on a water-resistant support, (2) a printing plate precursor having provided on a water-resistant support a lipophilic image-receiving layer comprising zinc oxide, which is converted into a printing plate by undergoing direct drawing image formation and then desensitizing treatment with a desensitizing solution to render the non-image area hydrophilic, (3) a printing plate precursor of an electrophotographic light-sensitive material having provided on a water-resistant support a photoconductive layer comprising photoconductive zinc oxide, which is converted into a printing plate by undergoing image formation and then desensitizing treatment with a desensitizing solution to render the non-image area hydrophilic, and (4) a printing plate precursor of a silver-halide photographic material having a silver halide emulsion layer provided on a water-resistant support.</p>
    <p num="3">With the development of office appliances and the expansion of office automation in recent years, it has been desired in the field of printing to adopt an offset printing system wherein a lithographic printing plate is directly prepared from the printing plate precursor of direct drawing type (the foregoing (1)) utilizing various image forming means, e.g., an electrophotographic printer, a heat-sensitive transfer printer or an ink jet printer without undergoing any other special treatment for conversion into the printing plate.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Further, another method for direct preparation of a printing plate wherein an electrophotographic printer is utilized has been proposed.
      <br/>
      More specifically, in an electronic editorial system wherein input, correction, editing, layout and pagination are performed by a continuous computer operation and the resulting image information is instantly transmitted into terminal plotters in distant places via a high-speed communication network or a communications satellite, an electrophotographic printer adaptable to digital signal input is used as the terminal plotter, and a printing plate is prepared directly from the output of the printer.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Recently, an ink jet recording method rapidly spreads because of its ability of low noise and high-speed printing.</p>
    <p num="6">With respect to the ink jet recording method, various ink jet systems, e.g., a so-called electric field controlling system in which ink is ejected utilizing electrostatic attraction, a so-called drop-on-demand system (pressure pulse system) in which ink is ejected utilizing an oscillation pressure of a piezoelectric element, and a so-called bubble (thermal) jet system in which ink is ejected utilizing a pressure developed by bubbles produced and grown by means of high thermal energy have been proposed, and these systems can provide images of high accuracy.</p>
    <p num="7">
      A conventional lithographic printing plate precursor of direct drawing type comprises a support, such as paper, having on one surface side an image-receiving layer which is a surface layer provided via an interlayer and on the other surface side a back layer.
      <br/>
      The interlayer and the backlayer are each composed of a water-soluble resin, such as PVA or starch, a water-dispersible resin, such as a synthetic resin emulsion, and a pigment.
      <br/>
      The image-receiving layer comprises an inorganic pigment, a water-soluble resin and a water resisting agent.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Examples of inorganic pigment used include kaolin, clay, talc, calcium carbonate, silica, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, barium sulfate and alumina.</p>
    <p num="9">Examples of water-soluble resin used include polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), modified PVA such as carboxylated PVA, starch and derivatives thereof, cellulose derivatives such as carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose, casein, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl acetate-crotonic acid copolymer, and styrene-maleic acid copolymer.</p>
    <p num="10">Examples of water resisting agent used include glyoxal, initial condensates of aminoplasts such as melamine-formaldehyde resin and urea-formaldehyde resin, modified polyamide resins such as methylolated polyamide resin, polyamide-polyamine-epichlorohydrin adduct, polyamide epichlorohydrin resin, and modified polyamide-polyimide resin.</p>
    <p num="11">In addition to the above described ingredients, it is known that a cross-linking catalyst such as ammonium chloride or a silane coupling agent can also be used.</p>
    <p num="12">
      However, for improving printing durability of a printing plate obtained by a conventional manner as described above, if the hydrophobicity of the printing plate is enhanced by adding a large amount of the water resisting agent or by using a hydrophobic resin, printing stains due to the decrease in hydrophilicity (affinity of the plate for water) occur although the press life is improved.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, the enhancement of hydrophilicity results in lowering of the water resistance to cause deterioration of press life.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In particular, when the printing plate is used under a temperature condition of 30 (degree)  C. or more, it has a defect that the surface layer thereof is dissolved in dampening water used for offset printing to result in deterioration of press life and occurrence of printing stains.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since images are drawn directly on an image-receiving layer of a printing plate precursor with oil-based ink in the case of direct drawing type lithography, poor adhesion of the oil-based ink to the image-receiving layer causes separation of the oil-based ink from the image area during printing, thereby deteriorating the press life even if the occurrence of printing stains in the non-image area is prevented because of sufficient hydrophilicity.
      <br/>
      This problem does not yet come to a satisfactory solution.
    </p>
    <p num="14">With respect to the ink used for forming images on a conventional lithographic printing plate precursor of direct drawing type in accordance with an ink jet recording system, water-based ink which uses water as the main solvent and oil-based ink which uses an organic solvent as the main solvent are ordinarily employed.</p>
    <p num="15">
      However, the water-based ink has drawbacks of blurring the images on the printing plate precursor and causing a decrease of drawing speed due to slow drying.
      <br/>
      In order to overcome such drawbacks, a method of utilizing oil-based ink containing a nonaqueous solvent as a dispersion medium is disclosed in JP-A-54-117203 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application").
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      This method, however, is still insufficient, because image blurs are actually observed on the plate obtained, and further blurs are generated in printed matter upon printing.
      <br/>
      In addition, the number of printed matter obtained with the printing plate is on the order of several hundreds at the most, which is much lower than the desired level.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the ink has a problem of being apt to clog a nozzle for ejecting so fine ink droplets as to form images of high resolution.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In the ink jet recording system, the ink is usually passed through a filter and then ejected from a nozzle.
      <br/>
      Thus, this system tends to cause ejection troubles depending on various factors such that the nozzle or filter is liable to be clogged, the ink-fluidity changes with the lapse of time, and so on.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Such ink ejection troubles are caused by not only a water-based ink compositions but also an oil-based ink composition.
      <br/>
      For preventing the ink ejection troubles, various proposals have been made.
      <br/>
      For instance, for preventing the ink ejection troubles in the case of using an oil-based ink composition in the ink jet recording system of electric field controlling type, it is proposed that the viscosity and specific resistance of the ink composition are controlled as described in JP-A-49-50935.
      <br/>
      It is also proposed that the dielectric constant and specific resistance of a solvent used for the ink composition are controlled as described in JP-A-53-29808.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Further, as attempts to prevent clogging of the nozzle due to ordinary oil-based ink for a printer in the ink jet recording system, methods of improving dispersion stability of pigment particles (as described, e.g., in JP-A-4-25573, JP-A-5-25413, and JP-A-5-65443), methods of incorporating specific compounds into ink compositions (as described, e.g., in JP-A-3-79677, JP-A-3-64377, JP-A-4-202386, JP-A-7-109431) have been proposed.</p>
    <p num="20">However, even if any of the ink compositions according to those methods is used for image formation on a printing plate precursor, the images formed suffer from insufficiency of strength during printing, so the resulting lithographic printing plate cannot have a satisfactory press life.</p>
    <p num="21">
      On the other hand, in the case of adopting a platemaking method wherein images are formed on a printing plate precursor having a zinc oxide-containing image-receiving layer by an appropriate method and then the non-image area is treated with a desensitizing solution, the image on the printing plate and printed matter have good quality and a great number of printed matter having good quality can be provided.
      <br/>
      However, this method is accompanied with the complication in wet processing.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it is essential for the method to use the desensitizing solution in the course of platemaking and dampening water containing the same desensitizing component as the desensitizing solution at the time of printing.
      <br/>
      In addition, it occurs, though depends on printing ink used, that the component in the dampening water used has interaction with some component in the printing ink to tend to cause stains in the printed matter.
      <br/>
      Thus, this method has a problem of being unsuitable for color printing with a wide variety of printing inks.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In the field of digital adaptable electrophotographic printer, remarkable technical improvements have been made lately.
      <br/>
      For instance, reproduction of high resolution image have been achieved by an electrophotographic printer using fine dry toner having a particle size of 6 to 8  MU m, and reproduction of highly accurate images with a high reproducibility have been achieved by an electrophotographic printer using liquid toner.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In a system of image formation on a printing plate precursor of direct drawing type by image transfer using, e.g., a laser printer of such a system as described above, therefore, it is required that both prevention of background stains in the non-image area after transfer and good image reproducibility in the image area be achieved to provide printed matter having clear images without background stains, in great numbers.
      <br/>
      Further, it is desired that printed matter having a wide variety of color images be easily obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Furthermore, it is requested to simply carry out the desensitizing treatment for the non-image area in the preparation of printing plate.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="25">The present invention aims to solve these problems accompanied with conventional methods for preparation of a printing plate.</p>
    <p num="26">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing a lithographic printing plate which can provide a great number of printed matter having clear images free from background stains and disappearance or distortion of images.</p>

    <p num="38">

    <p num="53">Now, the lithographic printing plate precursor according to the present invention will be described in more detail below.</p>
    <p num="54">The image-receiving layer which is provided on a water-resistant support in the lithographic printing plate precursor according to the present invention contains, as the main components, anatase-type titanium oxide grains and a binder resin comprising a complex composed of an organo-metallic polymer and an organic polymer containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of an amido bond, a urethane bond, a ureido bond and a hydroxy group.</p>
    <p num="55">
      The image-receiving layer of the printing plate precursor according to the present invention has the contact angle with water of at least 25 degrees.
      <br/>
      The contact angle thereof is preferably from 30 to 120 degrees, more preferably from 40 to 100 degrees.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The contact angle of the surface of the image-receiving layer with water is determined in the following manner.
      <br/>
      Two  MU l of distilled water is put on the surface of the light-sensitive layer at room temperature (from 15 to 35 (degree)  C.) and 30 seconds after, the contact angle of the surface of the image-receiving layer with water is measured by a surface contact meter (CA-D manufactured by Kyowa Kaimen Kagaku Co., Ltd.).
      <br/>
      The contact angle with water described herein is determined in the above manner.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      By adjusting the contact angle to the above described range, the images formed adhere satisfactorily to the image-receiving layer.
      <br/>
      As a result, the resulting printing plate can inhibit the image area from disappearance when it undergoes printing.
    </p>
    <p num="58">Further, the image-receiving layer is characterized in that, when the image-receiving layer is irradiated with ultraviolet light, the above described hydrophobic surface condition of the non-image area is converted into a hydrophilic surface condition having the contact angle with water of not greater than 15 degrees, preferably not greater than 10 degrees, most preferably not greater than 5 degrees.</p>
    <p num="59">Moreover, the printing plate precursor according to the present invention is characterized in that, even the printing plate rendered the non-image area hydrophilic is allowed to stand for a long time, the hydrophilic condition is fully retained.</p>
    <p num="60">The image-receiving layer according to the present invention preferably has a surface smoothness of at least 30 (sec/10 ml), in terms of a Bekk smoothness.</p>
    <p num="61">
      The term "Bekk smoothness" as used herein means a Bekk smoothness degree measured by a Bekk smoothness tester.
      <br/>
      In the Bekk smoothness tester, a sample piece is pressed against a circular glass plate having a highly smooth finish and a hole at the center while applying thereto a definite pressure (1 kg/cm2), and a definite volume (10 ml) of air is forced to pass between the sample piece and the glass surface under reduced pressure.
      <br/>
      Under this condition, a time (expressed in second) required for the air passage is measured.
    </p>
    <p num="62">In a case where images are formed on the lithographic printing plate precursor by means of an electrophotographic printer, an appropriate range of the Bekk smoothness depends on whether the toner used in the electrophotographic printer is dry toner or liquid toner.</p>
    <p num="63">
      More specifically, in the case of using dry toner in the electrophotographic printer, it is desirable that the Bekk smoothness of the image-receiving layer surface be preferably from 30 to 200 (sec/10 ml), more preferably from 50 to 150 (sec/10 ml).
      <br/>
      In the above described range, the adhesion of scattered toner to the non-image area (occurrence of backgrounds stain) is prevented and the toner adheres uniformly and firmly to the image area in the process of transferring and fixing the toner image to the printing plate precursor, whereby satisfactory reproduction of fine lines and fine letters and uniformity in the solid image area can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      In the case of using liquid toner in the electrophotographic printer, it is desirable for the image-receiving layer surface to have the Bekk smoothness of at least 30 (sec/10 ml), and the toner images transferred and fixed thereto can have better quality the higher the Bekk smoothness is.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the range thereof is preferably from 150 to 3,000 (sec/10 ml), more preferably from 500 to 2,500 (sec/10 ml).

      By controlling the Bekk smoothness of the surface side of the support which is contact with the image-receiving layer to at least 300 sec/10 ml, the image reproducibility and the press life can be more improved.
      <br/>
      As such improving effects can be obtained even when the image-receiving layer having the same surface smoothness is used, the increase in the smoothness of the support surface is considered to increase the adhesion between the image area and the image-receiving layer.
    </p>
    <p num="125">The Bekk smoothness of the surface of the support can be measured in the same manner as described with respect to the image-receiving layer.</p>
    <p num="126">
      The expression "highly smooth surface of the water-resistant support" as used herein means a surface coated directly with the image-receiving layer.
      <br/>
      In other words, when the support has an under and/or overcoat layer, e.g., a conductive layer described below, the highly smooth surface denotes the surface of the under and/or overcoat layer.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      Thus, the surface condition of the image-receiving layer can be controlled and fully kept without receiving the influence of surface roughness of the support used.
      <br/>
      As a result, it becomes possible to further improve the image quality.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      The adjustment of the surface smoothness to the above described range can be made using various well-known methods.
      <br/>
      For instance, the Bekk smoothness of support surface can be adjusted by coating a substrate with a resin using a melt adhesion method, or by using a strengthened calender method utilizing highly smooth heated rollers.

    <p num="129">In the case of utilizing an electrophotographic recording system to form images in the present invention, toner images are formed on the image-receiving layer provided on the water-resistant support with an electrophotographic process.</p>
    <p num="130">
      In general, the transfer of toner images to a material to be transferred in the electrophotographic process is carried out electrostatically.

    <p num="132">
      By adjusting the specific electric resistance to the above described range, blurs and distortion in the transferred image area and stains due to adhesion of toner to the non-image area can be prevented to a practically negligible extent, so that the images of good quality can be obtained.

      In the above described range of electric conductivity, the charged ink droplets just after attaching to the image-receiving layer can quickly lose their electric charge through earth.

      The conductive agents which can be used include both inorganic and organic ones.

      The conductive agents may be used individually or as a mixture of two or more thereof.

      Examples of the inorganic conductive agent include salts of monovalent metals such as Na, K and Li, salts or oxides of polyvalent metals such as Mg, Ca, Ba, Zn, Ti, Co, Ni, Zr, Al and Si, and ammonium salts.
      <br/>
      The organic conductive agents may be any of low molecular compounds and high molecular compounds which have conventionally been used as conductivity imparting agents, antistatic agents or surfactants.
      <br/>
      Examples of such a compound include conductive fillers (for example, granular carbon black or graphite, metal powder such as silver, copper, nickel, brass aluminum, steel or stainless steel powder, tin oxide powder, flaky aluminum or nickel, or fibrous carbon), metal soaps (such as metal salts of organic carboxylic acids, sulfonic acid or phosphonic acid), quaternary salt compounds (such as quaternary ammonium salts or quaternary phosphonium salts), anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, alcoholic compounds (such as acetylene-1,2-diol, xylylene diol or bisphenol A).

    </p>
    <p num="146">The amount of the conductive agent added to the conductive layer is preferably from 3 to 50% by weight, more preferably from 5 to 30% by weight, based on the binder resin used in the layer.</p>
    <p num="147">
      The binder resin used together with the conductive agent can be appropriately selected from various kinds of resins.
      <br/>
      Examples of a resin suitable for the binder include hydrophobic resins, for example, acrylic resins, vinyl chloride resins, styrene resins, styrene-butadiene resins, styrene-acrylic resins, urethane resins, vinylidene chloride resins and vinyl acetate resins, and hydrophilic resins, for example, polyvinyl alcohol resins, cellulose derivatives, starch and derivatives thereof, polyacrylamide resins, copolymers of vinyl ether and maleic anhydride, and copolymers of styrene and maleic anhydride.

      Examples of such a conductive thin film usable include a metallic foil and a conductive plastic film.

      More specifically, an aluminum foil can be used for the metallic foil, and a polyethylene resin film in which carbon black is incorporated can be used for the conductive plastic film.

      Both hard and soft aluminum foils can be used as the laminating material.

      For the lamination of a polyethylene resin in which carbon black is incorporated, it is preferred to adopt an extrusion lamination method.

      As a method for forming a conductive layer on the substrate, the same methods as described in the case where the whole of the support is conductive, can be used.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the composition containing a conductive filler and a binder is coated on one side of the substrate to form a layer having a thickness of from 5 to 20  MU m. Also, the conductive layer is formed by laminating a metal foil or a conductive plastic film on the substrate.

      Thus, clear images free from background stains can be formed in a plate-making utilizing a PPC duplicating machine of electrostatic transfer type.

    <p num="162">
      Image formation on the lithographic printing plate precursor can be performed by any appropriate method, for example, an electrophotographic recording system, an ink jet recording system or a heat-sensitive transfer recording system.

    <p num="163">
      The electrophotographic recording method employed herein may be any of various well-known recording systems.

      For instance, the recording systems described, e.g., in The Fundamentals and Applications of Electrophotographic Techniques, edited by Electrophotographic Society, Corona Co. (1988), Kenichi Eda, Journal of Electrophotographic Society, 27, 113 (1988), and Akio Kawamoto, ibid., 33, 149 (1994) and 32, 196 (1993); and commercially available PPC duplicating machines can be employed.

    <p num="164">
      A combination of an exposure system in which the exposure is performed by scanning the laser beams based on digital information with a development system using a liquid developer can be adopted as an effective method for image information, because it enables the formation of highly accurate images.
      <br/>
      One example utilizing such a combination is illustrated below.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      A photosensitive material is positioned on a flat bed by a register pin system, and fixed to the flat bed by undergoing air suction from the back side.
      <br/>
      Then, the photosensitive material is charged by means of a charging device described, e.g., in the above-described reference, The Fundamentals and Applications of Electrophotographic Techniques, p. 212 et seq.
      <br/>
      Specifically, a corotron or scotron system is ordinarily used for charging.
      <br/>
      At the time of charging, it is also preferred to control the charging condition so that the surface potential of the photosensitive material is always kept within the intended range through a feedback system based on the information from a means of detecting the potential of the charged photosensitive material.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the scanning exposure using a laser-beam source is performed according to, e.g., the method as described in the reference described above, p. 254 et seq.
    </p>
    <p num="166">
      Then, toner image formation is carried out with a liquid developer.
      <br/>
      The photosensitive material charged and exposed on the flat bed is detached from the flat bed, and subjected to wet development as described in the reference described above, p. 275 et seq.
      <br/>
      The exposure is carried out in a mode corresponding to the toner image development mode.
      <br/>
      In the case of reversal development, for instance, a negative image, or an image area, is exposed to laser beams, a toner having the same charge polarity as the charged photosensitive material is employed, and the toner is adhered electrically to the exposed area by applying a bias voltage for development.
      <br/>
      The principle of this process is explained in detail in the reference described above, p. 157 et seq.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      For removal of excess developer after development, the photosensitive material is squeegeed with a rubber roller, a gap roller or a reverse roller, or subjected to corona squeegee or air squeegee as described at page 283 of the above-described reference.
      <br/>
      Before such a squeegee treatment, the photosensitive material is preferably rinsed with only a carrier liquid of the liquid developer.

    <p num="168">Then, the toner image formed on the photosensitive material is transferred onto the lithographic printing plate precursor according to the present invention directly or via a transfer intermediate, and fixed to the printing plate precursor.</p>
    <p num="169">Image formation using an ink jet recording system is described below.</p>
    <p num="170">
      The ink jet recording may be performed using any of well-known ink jet recording systems.
      <br/>
      However, the use of oil-based ink is desirable because it ensures quick drying and satisfactory fixation of the ink image and hardly clogs a nozzle and a filter, and the adoption of an electrostatic ejection type ink jet recording system is desirable because it hardly causes image blurs.
    </p>
    <p num="171">Now, the electrostatic ejection type ink jet recording system utilizing oil-based ink is described in detail below.</p>
    <p num="172">
      The oil-based ink used in the present invention is a dispersion of hydrophobic resin particles, which are solid at least at ordinary temperature (15 to 35 (degree)  C.), in a nonaqueous solvent, preferably having an electric resistance of 109  OMEGA  * cm or more and a dielectric constant of 3.5 or below.
      <br/>
      By using such a nonaqueous solvent as a dispersing medium, the electric resistance of the oil-based ink can be controlled appropriately.
      <br/>
      As a result, the ejection of ink by the action of an electric field can be properly carried out, whereby the image quality is improved.
      <br/>
      Further, since the use of resin particles as described above can provide an enhanced affinity for the image-receiving layer, images of good quality can be formed and press life can be improved.
    </p>
    <p num="173">
      Preferred examples of the nonaqueous solvent having an electric resistance of 109  OMEGA  * cm or more and a dielectric constant of 3.5 or below include straight chain or branched aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and halogenated products of those hydrocarbons.
      <br/>
      Specific examples thereof include octane, isooctane, decane, isodecane, decaline, nonane, dodecane, isododecane, cyclohexane, cyclooctane, cyclodecane, benzene, toluene, xylene, mesitylene, Isopar E, Isopar G, Isopar H and Isopar L (Isopar: trade name, products of Exxon Corp.), Shellsol 70 and Shellsol 71 (Shellsol: trade name, products of Shell Oil Corp.), and Amsco OMS and Amsco 460 solvent (Amusco: trade name, products of American Mineral Spirits Corp.).
      <br/>
      They can be used individually or as a mixture of two or more thereof.
      <br/>
      As to the nonaqueous solvent, the upper limit of the electric resistance value is of the order of 1016  OMEGA  * cm, and the lower limit of the dielectric constant values is about 1.8.
    </p>
    <p num="174">
      When the electric resistance of the nonaqueous solvent used is too low beyond the foregoing range, the resulting ink cannot have an appropriate electric resistance, so that the ejection of ink by the action of an electric field becomes poor.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the dielectric constant of the nonaqueous solvent used is too high beyond the foregoing range, the electric field is apt to be relaxed in the ink, and thereby poor ejection of the ink tends to occur.
    </p>
    <p num="175">
      The resin particles dispersed in the nonaqueous solvent as described above are hydrophobic resin particles which are solid at temperature of 35 (degree)  C. or below and have good affinity with the nonaqueous solvent.
      <br/>
      As such a hydrophobic resin, a resin (P) having a glass transition temperature of -5 (degree)  C. to 110 (degree)  C. or a softening temperature of 33 (degree)  C. to 140 (degree)  C. is preferred.
      <br/>
      The more preferable range of the glass transition temperature is from 10 (degree)  C. to 100 (degree)  C. and that of the softening temperature is from 38 (degree)  C. to 120 (degree)  C. In particular, it is preferred for the resin (P) to have a glass transition temperature of 15 (degree)  C. to 80 (degree)  C. or a softening temperature of 38 (degree)  C. to 100 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="176">
      By using a resin having such a glass transition temperature or a softening temperature as described above, the affinity of each resin particle with the surface of the image-receiving layer is enhanced and the resin particles are firmly bonded to one another on the printing plate precursor.
      <br/>
      Thus, the adhesion of the ink image to the image-receiving layer is increased and the press life is improved.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, if the glass transition temperature or a softening temperature of the resin used is beyond the upper and lower limits specified above, the affinity of each resin particle with the image-receiving layer surface is lowered and the bond between resin particles is weakened.
    </p>
    <p num="177">The weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the resin (P) is preferably from 1 * 103 to 1 * 106, more preferably from 5 * 103 to 8 * 105, and yet more preferably from 1 * 104 to 5 * 105.</p>

    <p num="179">
      It is desirable for the resin particles to be contained in the oil-based ink in an amount of from 0.5 to 20% by weight based on the total ink.
      <br/>
      When the amount of the resin particles is lower than 0.5% by weight, it becomes hard for the ink to have an affinity with the image-receiving layer of the printing plate precursor and as a result, the ink cannot form images of good quality and the press life decreases.
      <br/>
      When the proportion is increased beyond the foregoing range, on the other hand, it is difficult to form a homogeneous dispersion and as a result, the ink is apt to clog an ejection head and stable ink ejection may not be achieved.

      Such a coloring material as described above may be dispersed into the nonaqueous solvent as a dispersed particle separately from the resin particles, or it may be incorporated into the resin particles dispersed in the nonaqueous solvent.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, the incorporation of a pigment is ordinarily effected by coating the pigment with the resin material of resin particles to form resin-coated particles, while the incorporation of a dye is ordinarily effected by coloring the surface part of resin particles with the dye to form colored particles.

      As the polymerization granulation method, well-known methods for dispersion polymerization in nonaqueous media can be employed.
      <br/>
      Details of such methods are described, e.g., in The Newest Technology of Super-fine Polymer Particles, chapter 2, edited under the supervision of Soichi Muroi, CMC Shuppan (1991), The Latest Systems for Electrophotographic Development, and Development and Application of Toner Materials, chapter 3, edited by Koichi Nakamura, Nippon Kagaku Joho K.K.

    <p num="189">
      In order to stabilize the particles dispersed in a nonaqueous medium, the particles are generally dispersed together with a dispersing polymer (also referred to as dispersion stabilizing resin hereinafter sometimes) (PS).
      <br/>
      The dispersing polymer (PS) contains repeating units soluble in the nonaqueous medium as the main component, and weight average molecular weight (Mw) thereof is preferably from 1 * 103 to 1 * 106, more preferably from 5 * 103 to 5 * 105

    <p num="192">
      In addition to the repeating unit represented by formula (III), the dispersing polymer (PS) may contain other repeating units as copolymerizing components.
      <br/>
      The copolymerizing components may be derived from any monomers as far as they can be copolymerized with the monomers corresponding to the repeating units of formula (III).
    </p>
    <p num="193">The suitable proportion of the repeating unit represented by formula (III) in the dispersing polymer (PS) is preferably at least 50% by weight, more preferably at least 60% by weight.</p>

    <p num="195">In preparing the foregoing resin (P) particles in the state of an emulsion (latex), it is preferred that the dispersing polymer (PS) is added prior to the polymerization.</p>
    <p num="196">In the case of using a dispersing polymer (PS), the proportion of the dispersing polymer in the total ink is from about 0.05 to about 4% by weight.</p>
    <p num="197">In the oil-based ink employed in the present invention, it is desirable that the dispersed resin particles and colored particles (the particles of coloring material) be positively or negatively charged electroscopic particles.</p>
    <p num="198">
      In order to impart the electroscopicity to those particles, the technology of a wet developer for electrostatic photography can be appropriately utilized.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the electroscopicity can be imparted to the particles by using electroscopic materials, for example, charge control agents and other additives as described, e.g., in The Latest Systems for Electrophotographic Development System, and Development and Application of Toner Materials, pp. 139-148, The Fundamentals and Applications of Electrophotographic Techniques, edited by Electrophotographic Society, pp. 497-505, Corona Co. (1988), and Yuji Harasaki, Electrophotography, vol. 16 (No.2), p. 44 (1977).
    </p>
    <p num="199">In addition, details of those materials are described, e.g., in British Patents 893,429 and 934,038, U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,122,397, 3,900,412 and 4,606,989, JP-A-60-179751, JP-A-60-185963 and JP-A-2-13965.</p>
    <p num="200">
      The charge control agent as described above is preferably used in an amount of 0.001 to 1.0 parts by weight per 1,000 parts by weight of dispersing medium as a carrier liquid.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, various kinds of additives can be added, but the total amount of additives has an upper limit because it is restricted by the electric resistance allowable for the oil-based ink used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      More specifically, when the ink has an electric resistance of lower than 109  OMEGA  * cm in the condition that the dispersed particles are removed from the ink, the formation of a continuous gradation image having good quality may become difficult.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is required that the amount of each additive added be controlled within the above described limitation.

    <p num="201">
      A method for forming images on the lithographic printing plate precursor (also referred to as "master" hereinafter) according to the present invention using an ink jet recording system is described in more detail below.
      <br/>
      One example of a device system suitable for performing such a method is shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="202">The device system shown in FIG. 1 comprises an ink jet recording device 1 wherein an oil-based ink is used.</p>
    <p num="203">
      As shown in FIG. 1, pattern information of images (figures and letters) to be formed on a master 2 is first supplied from an information supply source such as a computer 3, to the ink jet recording device 1 using oil-based ink through a transmission means such as a bus 4.
      <br/>
      A head for ink jet recording 10 of the recording device 1 stores oil-based ink inside.
      <br/>
      When the master 2 is passed through the recording device 1, the head 10 ejects fine droplets of the ink onto the master 2 in accordance with the foregoing information, whereby the ink is attached to the master 2 in the foregoing pattern.
      <br/>
      Thus, the image formation on the master 2 is completed, and the lithographic printing plate precursor having the images thereon is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="204">
      Components of the ink jet recording device as shown in the device system of FIG. 1 are shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, respectively.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, members common to the members in FIG. 1 are designated using the same symbols, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="205">FIG. 2 is a schematic view showing the main part of the ink jet recording device, and FIG. 3 is a partially cross sectional view of the head.</p>
    <p num="206">
      As shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, the head 10 attached to the ink jet recording device has a slit between an upper unit 101 and a lower unit 102, a leading edge thereof forms an ejection slit 10a.
      <br/>
      Further, an ejection electrode 10b is arrange in the slit, and the interior of the slit is filled with oil-based ink 11.
    </p>
    <p num="207">
      To the ejection electrode 10b of the head 10, voltage is applied in accordance with digital signals from the pattern information of image.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, a counter electrode 10c is arranged so as to face with the ejection electrode 10b, and the master 2 is provided on the counter electrode 10c.
      <br/>
      By the application of the voltage, a circuit is formed between the ejection electrode 10b and the counter electrode 10c, and the oil-based ink 11 is ejected from the ejection slit 10a of the head 10, thereby forming images on the master 2 provided on the counter electrode 10c.
    </p>
    <p num="208">With respect to the width of the ejection electrode 10b, it is preferred for the leading edge thereof to be as narrow as possible in order to form images of high quality.</p>
    <p num="209">For instance, print of 40  MU m-dot can be formed on the master 2 by filling the head 10 as shown in FIG. 3 with the oil-based ink, disposing the ejection electrode 10b having a leading edge having a width of 20  MU m and the counter electrode 10c so as to face with each other at a distance of 1.5 mm and applying a voltage of 3 KV for 0.1 millisecond between these two electrodes.</p>
    <p num="210">Desensitization with a dry process according to the present invention is described below.</p>
    <p num="211">The lithographic printing plate precursor having the colored images is irradiated all over with ultraviolet light, thereby selectively changing the surface condition of only the non-image area to be hydrophilic.</p>
    <p num="212">The image area, on the other hand, retains hydrophobic property because the colored images are impermeable to ultraviolet light.</p>
    <p num="213">
      The light source of ultraviolet light used for the irradiation may be any of lamps emitting light having a wavelength of from 300 to 450 nm.
      <br/>
      In particular, a lamp which enables efficient use of wavelengths of from 350 nm to 420 nm is preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="214">
      Suitable examples of such a lamp include a mercury lamp, a metal halide lamp and a xenon lamp.
      <br/>
      The irradiating condition can be appropriately selected as far as the surface of the irradiated area can have a contact angle with water of 15 degrees or below.
      <br/>
      For instance, the preferable irradiation time is up to about 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="215">Thus, a printing plate which can provide printed matter having clear images free from background stains by offset printing can be prepared.</p>
    <p num="216">
      The lithographic printing plate precursor according to the present invention has an image-receiving layer comprising anatase-type titanium oxide grains and a binder resin comprising a complex composed of an organometallic polymer and an organic polymer containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of an amido bond, a urethane bond, a ureido bond and a hydroxy group, and the contact angle of water with the surface of the image-receiving layer is at least 25 degrees, and the contact angle is changed to 15 degrees or below by irradiation with ultraviolet light.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the printing plate precursor can be desensitized in a dry state by irradiation with ultraviolet light, thereby forming a lithographic printing plate which can provide a great number of printed matter having clear images free from background stains.
    </p>
    <p num="217">Further, the platemaking method according to the present invention enables the easy image formation on the printing plate precursor utilizing an electrophotographic recording system, an ink jet recording system or the like and the dry-desensitization utilizing ultraviolet irradiation, and forms a lithographic printing plate which has excellent press life and can provide a great number of printed matter having clear images free from background stains, disappearance, distortion and blurs in the image area.</p>

      <br/>
      The laser beam scanning was performed on the basis of image information which was obtained by previously reading an original with a color scanner, subjecting the read image information to color separation, making some corrections relating to color reproduction of the system used, and then memorizing the corrected image information as digital image data in the internal hard disk of the system.

      The image formation was performed on each of the thus prepared lithographic printing plate precursor Specimen Nos.

      II-11 to II-17 using Oil-Based Ink (IK-1) in the same manner as in Example II-1, and the ink images were fixed in the same manner as in Example II-1.
      <br/>
      During the image formation, the under layer provided just under the image-receiving layer of the printing plate precursor was connected electrically to the counter electrode by silver paste.
    </p>
    <p num="395">
      Subsequently, each printing plate precursor was irradiated with ultraviolet light for 3 minutes with the same light source as used in Example II-1 which was placed in a distance of 20 cm.
      <br/>
      Thus, lithographic printing plates samples were obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="396">The contact angles of water with the non-image area and the image area of each lithographic printing plate were 0 degree and 70 degrees respectively.</p>
    <p num="397">
      Then, each of the lithographic printing plates was mounted in an automatic printing machine (AM-2850, trade name, produced by AM Co.
      <br/>
      Ltd.), and printing was performed using black ink for offset printing and dampening water prepared by diluting SLM-OD 50 times with distilled water and placed in a dampening saucer.
    </p>
    <p num="398">
      Each of the lithographic printing plates was examined for image quality of printing plate, image quality of printed matter therefrom and press life.
      <br/>
      The following criteria were employed for evaluating those qualities.
      <br/>
      1) Image quality of printing plate:
    </p>
    <p num="399">
      The images of each lithographic printing plate were observed using an optical microscope of 200 magnifications, and the image quality was evaluated.
      <br/>
      The capital letters E, G and B in Table II-3 below represent the following states, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="400">E: The images are very clear, and even fine lines and fine letters have excellent quality.</p>
    <p num="401">G: The images are clear, and even fine lines and fine letters have good quality.</p>
    <p num="402">
      B: There are disappearance and blurs in the areas of fine lines and fine letters, so the image quality is bad.
      <br/>
      2) Image quality of printed matter:
    </p>
    <p num="403">
      The quality of images on each printed matter obtained from each lithographic printing plate was evaluated in the same manner as in the above item 1).
      <br/>
      The capital letters E, G and B in Table II-3 represent that the printed matters are in the same states as described above, respectively.
      <br/>
      3) Press life:
    </p>
    <p num="404">The press life is expressed in terms of the number of printed matter obtained until background stains or disappearance of image was visually observed on the printed matter.</p>
    <p num="405">The results are shown in Table II-3 below.</p>

      The images formed were clear, even the fine lines and fine letters had good quality, and the press life was good.

      II-11 and II-12, the under layer had specific electric resistance of higher than 1011 Q OMEGA  * cm.
      <br/>
      In these specimen, disappearance or blurs of image were observed.
      <br/>
      In addition, as the result of the blurs, the resin layer in the image area became thin, resulting in lowering the press life.
    </p>
    <p num="410">In other words, the results obtained indicate that the image quality of printing plate and the image quality of printed matter are better as the conductivity of the under layer provided just under the image-receiving layer is higher.</p>
