    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a core material for a noise filter, and in particular to a core material suitable to high frequency more than 200 MHz.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A noise filter using a magnetic material for a core has utilized a noise controlling effect due to magnetic loss of the magnetic material of the core.
      <br/>
      For the noise filter using such magnetic material, since impedance(Z) and resistance (R) are required to be large, the core material for the noise filter should have large relative magnetic permeability and magnetic loss.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Conventionally, the noise filter using the magnetic material as the core has used a ferrite as the core material.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The noise filter using the ferrite as the core sufficiently functions as the noise filter for low frequency.
      <br/>
      However, if it is used in a domain of high frequency, a number of coils must be increased.
      <br/>
      Further, when the coil number is increased, many coils are close together and floating capacitance occurred inconveniently.
      <br/>
      Further, in an area of high frequency as 100 MHz or more, such filters cannot be used.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication (kokai) No. Hei 10-12442 discloses a core material for a noise filter available in wide zones as high frequency of 100 MHz or more.
      <br/>
      In the core material, two or more magnetic layers different in thickness are laminated via an insulating layer on a surface of a thin sheet of magnetic material such as permalloy.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      However, this core material had defects that since the core material is produced by forming thin layers of an insulating layer and a magnetic layer through a spattering process on a thin sheet of magnetic material made of such as permalloy.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, each of processes take much time, number of the processes are many, and costs for materials are expensive.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <p num="13">A core material for noise filter according to the present invention will be explained in detail.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Powders of soft magnetic material of the core material for the noise filter according to the present invention may be powders of known soft magnetic material such as pure iron, permalloy, molybdenum permalloy, Sendust alloy, soft magnetic amorphous alloy powders.
      <br/>
      Particularly, an alloy composed of Cr: 0.5 to 20%, Si: 0.001 to 3.0%, Al: 0.01 to 20% and the balance being Fe and unavoidable impurities (Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication (kokai) No. 10-261516) is preferable since it has high permeability, excellent corrosion resistance, easy flatness and small coercive force (Hc).
    </p>
    <p num="15">This soft magnetic material powder is that the larger is the aspect ratio, the smaller is the antimagnetic field coefficient, and the aspect ratio is not less than 10, more preferable not less than 25, and the average diameter is 100  MU m or less, the average breadth is 60  MU m or less and the average thickness is 3  MU m or less.</p>
    <p num="16">In addition, as the rubber or plastic of the insulating material for the core material for the noise filter, may be employed natural rubber, synthetic rubber as chloroprene rubber, polybutadiene rubber, polyisoprene rubber, ethylene propylene rubber, acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, isobutylene isoprene rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, soft or hard plastics as phenol resin, epoxy resin, polyester resin, acrylic resin, polyvinyl acetate resin, polystyrene resin, polypropylene resin, polyurethane and polycarbonate resin, or poly ethylene chlorate.</p>
    <p num="17">The mixing ratio of the soft magnetic material powder and the insulating material is not limited to the above mentioned, but the soft magnetic material powder is 50 vol % or more, 70 wt % or more, e.g., 80 wt %, and the insulating material is 50 vol % or less, 30 wt % or less, e.g., 20 wt % or less.</p>
    <p num="18">
      The core material according to the present invention is produced in the following manner.
      <br/>
      Namely, the powders of the soft magnetic material (e.g., flat) and the insulating material are mixed uniformly by means of such as a mixing roller.
      <br/>
      Then, after molding such as a roll molding, an extrusion molding and an injection molding, it is molded by a molding method by which residual strain does not remain in the powders of the soft magnetic material so as to be molded in the cross section as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, 1 is the core material, 2 is the flat and soft magnetic material, and 3 is the insulating material.
      <br/>
      If necessary, it is cut in a desirable size.
      <br/>
      Incidentally, so-called pressed powder magnetic core produced by a press powder molding method such as pressing has residual strain.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is not preferable as the producing method in the present invention.

      <br/>
      The damping factor in each frequency of this common mode noise filter was measured.
      <br/>
      The result is shown in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The measuring manner of the damping factor in each frequency was made by measuring S21 through a network analyzer.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The sheet of the core material for the noise filter as a Comparative Example 1 was manufactured by providing the magnetic layer of the thin film having thickness 5  MU m composed of 78 wt % Ni--Fe permalloy on one side of a strip of the magnetic material having thickness 5  MU m composed of 78 wt % Ni--Fe permalloy via the insulating layer having thickness 5  MU m of SiO2, and further providing 10 layers of the magnetic material having thickness 5  MU m composed of 78 wt % Ni--Fe permalloy via the insulating layer having thickness 5  MU m of SiO2.
      <br/>
      From this sheet, the core for the common mode noise filter of 1 mm width and 12 mm length was made, and coiled (14 turns) to make a common mode noise filter.
      <br/>
      The damping factor in each frequency of this common mode noise filter was measured and described in FIG. 2.
