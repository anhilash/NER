    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an apparatus for reading optical data from a motion picture film and a light source therefor.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Conventional motion picture film may include picture recording regions respectively arranged in a plurality of frames at an approximate mid-portion of the film and two series or rows of film take-up holes (perforations) respectively located on either side of each picture recording region.
      <br/>
      Such motion picture film may further include a linear analog sound track located between the picture recording regions and one row of the perforations which extends in a film take-up direction.
      <br/>
      Analog signals may be recorded onto such analog sound track by the use of analog recording techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Due to the recent progress in digital technology, audio information or data associated with a motion picture may be digitally recorded onto a motion picture film.
      <br/>
      However, the recording position of the picture recording regions and the analog sound track are standardized by the Society Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), an association in USA of motion picture and television engineers.
      <br/>
      As a result, digitized audio information or data is recorded in positions other than the picture recording regions and the analog sound track.
      <br/>
      More specifically, two digital sound tracks are provided in the film running direction of the motion picture film for recording digitized audio data therein and for reproducing the recorded digitized audio data therefrom.
      <br/>
      Each of such digital sound tracks is located between the perforations and a respective one of the lateral film edges.
      <br/>
      The audio data includes audio data for a right channel and audio data for a left channel which are each respectively recorded in a linear manner in one of the two digital sound tracks.
      <br/>
      Each of such audio data includes synchronization data, audio data and tracking patterns which are recorded in a direction normal to the film running direction in the digital sound tracks.
      <br/>
      The synchronization data or pattern is formed at the leading end of a block made up of a predetermined number of data followed by the audio data which is recorded block-by-block.
      <br/>
      The tracking patterns are recorded at each of the recording start and the recording end portions.
      <br/>
      Such tracking patterns are recorded in stripes on both sides of the digital sound tracks extending along the film running direction.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A reproducing apparatus for reproducing the digitized audio data from the motion picture film may include two CCD line sensors adapted for scanning the digital sound tracks so as to respectively read out the audio data recorded in the channels.
      <br/>
      Each of the CCD line sensors has a one-line reading region and is arranged so as to read such line in a direction normal to the film running or proceeding direction.
      <br/>
      Light out of a halogen lamp which is always turned on during reproduction is radiated from the back surface of the motion picture film.
      <br/>
      As a result, the synchronization data, audio data and the tracking patterns recorded on the digital sound tracks of the motion picture film are illuminated and radiated on the reading regions of each of the CCD line sensors.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The CCD line sensors have a function of so-called electronic shutter and are controlled so as to receive light for a predetermined time period.
      <br/>
      The CCD line sensors receive the illuminated synchronization data, audio data and the tracking patterns and convert them into electrical signals which are supplied to a data processor included in the reproducing apparatus.
      <br/>
      The data processor reproduces the audio data on a block basis in synchronization with the synchronization data and routes the reproduced audio data to a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter, which may be included in the reproducing apparatus, so as to convert the audio data to analog audio signals.
      <br/>
      Such analog audio signals may be thereafter supplied to a speaker unit.
      <br/>
      As a result, the speech corresponding to the digital audio data is provided by way of the speaker unit.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      As previously described, the data processor receives signals corresponding to the tracking patterns from the CCD line sensors.
      <br/>
      Such signals are utilized by the data processor to provide tracking control data.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the tracking pattern is recorded at the recording start position and the recording end position for one-line of audio data.
      <br/>
      The data processor detects a level difference between, for example, the tracking pattern reproduced at the recording start position and that reproduced at the recording end position, so as to determine or detect a tracking error.
      <br/>
      The readout timing of the CCD line sensor is variably controlled in response to the tracking error.
      <br/>
      As a result, tracking error may be corrected so as to effect reproduction of the audio data at all times in the so-called just-track condition.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Heretofore, a halogen lamp has been used as a light source for reproducing audio data.
      <br/>
      However, the halogen lamp suffers from such defects as increased power consumption and heat evolution, such that heat radiating means have to be provided thus leading to an increased size of the apparatus and increased production cost.
      <br/>
      In addition, the halogen lamp has only a short service life and presents problems in operational reliability and increased labor in maintenance and management.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In addition, it has hitherto been practiced to keep the halogen lamp turned on at all times in order to reproduce audio data, so that it has been necessary to provide the above-mentioned CCD image sensor having the function of an electronic shutter.
      <br/>
      The function of the electronic shutter is to drain charges accumulated in respective pixels of the CCD image sensor by a drain pulse in order to adjust the charge accumulation time.
      <br/>
      There is now presented a problem that the charges drained by the drain pulse be fluctuated from pixel to pixel and that such fluctuations appear as an output noise in the CCD image sensor output.
      <br/>
      If the CCD image sensor output is subjected to such noise, the error rate is deteriorated and an abnormal noise is occasionally produced in the playback sound.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">An object of the present invention is to provide an optical data reading apparatus which may be reduced in size and in production cost and which may be improved in operating reliability.</p>
    <p num="11">Another object of the present invention is to provide a light source for reading optical data which may be reduced in power consumption and heat evolution and which may be improved in durability.</p>
    <p num="12">Another object of the present invention is to provide a light source for reading optical data which may be able to radiate a sufficient quantity of widely spread readout light to an information recording medium.</p>
    <p num="13">A still another object of the present invention is to provide a light source for reading optical data which may be able to radiate widely spread readout light with a uniform light quantity to an information recording medium.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In its one aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus for reading optical data from a motion picture film including at least one digital sound track extending along film running direction having a recording area with lines extending in a direction normal to the film running direction and columns extending in the film running direction.
      <br/>
      The apparatus includes a light emitting diode for emitting the readout light radiated on the motion picture film, light emission controlling means for driving the light emitting diode by pulsed lighting at a pre-set timing in a controlled manner, and a CCD line sensor for receiving the readout light radiated by the light emitting diode to the motion picture film.
      <br/>
      The CCD line sensor reproduces the readout light to digital data by photo-electric conversion and outputs the reproduced digital data.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In another aspect, the present invention provides a light source of an apparatus for reading optical data from a motion picture film including at least one digital sound track extending along film running direction having a recording area with lines extending in a direction normal to the film running direction and columns extending in the film running direction.
      <br/>
      The method includes an optical fiber for guiding the readout light incident on plural branched light input sections for radiating the readout light on the motion picture film at a light output thereof, at least one first light emitting diode for radiating the readout light at at least one of the light input sections from a direction along the optical axis of the optical fiber, and at least one second light emitting diode for radiating the readout light at at least one of the light input sections from an oblique direction intersecting the optical axis of the optical fiber.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Since the light emitting diode is employed in the optical data readout apparatus according to the present invention, high-speed driving for pulsed lighting can be realized in a manner which has not been possible with the halogen lamp.
      <br/>
      Thus the readout light can be intermittently radiated to the CCD line sensor so that it becomes possible to use a CCD line sensor not having the electronic shutter function.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the CCD line sensor having the electronic function may be employed without exploiting the electronic shutter function.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Thus it becomes possible to prevent the quantity of electronic charges to be drained by the drain pulse from being fluctuated from pixel to pixel and such fluctuations be presented as CCD line sensor output noise, while it becomes possible to prevent abnormal noise from being produced in the playback sound and to improve the error rate.</p>
    <p num="18">
      The light emitting diode is small-sized and longer in service life while being low in power consumption or heat evolution.
      <br/>
      Thus the power consumption or heat evolution may be lower than when the halogen lamp is used as a light source.
      <br/>
      Consequently, there is no necessity of employing separate heat dissipating means, so that the size of he apparatus and hence its production cost may be diminished.
      <br/>
      The light emitting diode is longer in service life thus simplifying maintenance and management and improving operating reliability.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In addition, with the optical data readout apparatus according to the present invention, the light emitting diode radiates the red-hued light to the digital sound track.
      <br/>
      That is, by employing a red-hued light emitting diode as the light emitting diode, the CCD line sensor can positively receive the playback light of the audio data on account of excellent light receiving characteristics for the red-hued light of the CCD line sensor, thereby improving audio data reproducing accuracy.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Furthermore, with the light source for reading optical data according to the present invention, the readout light is radiated to respective light receiving sections of the optical fibers by plural second light emitting diodes from a plurality of oblique directions intersecting the optical axis of the optical fibers, thereby increasing the quantity of spread-out components of the readout light radiated from the light output of the optical fibers onto the information recording medium, thereby diminishing readout errors due to scratches and contamination in the information recording medium.</p>

      That is, C, R, CR, SR, SW and LM are recorded as a right-channel or route of audio data in the digital sound track 20R.
    </p>
    <p num="33">On the digital sound track 20L or on the digital sound track 20R, there are recorded letters such as "SAFETY FILM". with a line thickness of 150 to 200  MU m, as shown for example in FIG. 2, as the visibly recognizable identification information (ID code).</p>
    <p num="34">
      Such ID code may include the name of the film manufacturer, name of the developer, recording data or the title of the motion picture film.

      Since these can be recognized visibly, the name of the film manufacturer, for example, may be recognized easily.

      The left route audio data for C, L, CL, SL, SW and RM and the right route audio data for C, R, CR, SR, SW and LM, respectively recorded on the digital sound tracks 20L, 20R, are processed with high efficiency encoding consisting in the combination of sub-band coding, orthogonal transform encoding or bit allocation, whereby the data volume is compressed to about one-fifth as large as the original data volume.
      <br/>
      For each film block, which is one recording unit, the C2 parity and C1 parity error correction codes, employing the cross-interleave Reed Solomon code, are appended along with leading end data comprised of synchronization data, tracking patterns and identification information.
      <br/>
      At the same width-wise position of the film, the right and left channels are physically shifted in their recording positions by e.g., 17.8 frames from each other.
    </p>
    <p num="36">More specifically, audio data are recorded on the digital analog sound tracks 20L, 20R on the basis of film blocks as recording units, a shown in FIG. 3.</p>
    <p num="37">
      The film blocks are formed by the above-described interleaving, and the right and left channel digital sound tracks are recorded on a channel-by-channel basis.
      <br/>
      More specifically, audio data may be recorded in each film block in the digital sound tracks as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      That is, recorded in such film blocks are the leading end data 50, light-barrier regions 51 which extend on one side of the digital sound tracks in the film running direction and which may have a width of approximately of 0.12 mm, the audio data, C1 parity and C2 parity which extend in a direction normal to the film running direction and in a side-by-side relation to the film running direction, and stripe-shaped tracking patterns 53a and 53b which extend in the film running direction and which are located adjacent to the light barrier regions 51, as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The tracking patterns 53a and 53b may be a white/black repeat pattern having a predetermined repeat interval, such as an interval of one dot, in the film running direction.
      <br/>
      Such tracking patterns 53 and 53b may be recorded with a one dot offset in the film running direction as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Further, 1-byte (8 bits) of data 52 extends in a film running direction.
      <br/>
      In other words, 1-byte of audio data of any channel is aligned along the film running direction.
      <br/>
      Such arrangement improves the quality of the audio reproduction.
      <br/>
      That is, the ability for performing error correction does not change when a 1 bit error or 8 bits of error occur in a 1-byte of data in an error correction system utilizing a predetermined coding technique, such as Reed-Solomon coding or the like, in which error correction may be performed with a 1-byte (8 bits) unit.
      <br/>
      Such arrangement may be disadvantageous if the 1-byte allocation is aligned or arranged in a direction normal to the scratches.
      <br/>
      However, as previously described, longitudinal scratches typically occur more frequently than transverse scratches on motion picture film as the film is repeatedly reproduced.
      <br/>
      Therefore, by arranging the data in a one byte arrangement in-line with the film running direction as previously described, the present invention may relatively easily correct or compensate for errors caused by the more frequently occurring type of scratches, that is, longitudinal scratches.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      FIG. 4 illustrates a pattern of the leading end data 50.

      A black and white repeat pattern extends at right angles to the film running direction.
      <br/>
      The azimuth check pattern 56 includes a 2-dot white/black repeat pattern 56a recorded in a direction normal to the film running direction and a 2-dot white/black repeat pattern 56b recorded with an offset of 2 dots in a direction normal to the film running direction with respect to the repeat pattern 56a.

      The above-described film block may be symmetrically recorded in the right channel digital sound track 5R and the left channel digital sound track 5L of the motion picture film of the present invention.

      <br/>
      During reproduction, the left channel digital sound track 5L is read from the left edge 1L of the film 1, while the right channel digital sound track 5R is read from the right edge 1R of the film The audio data recorded on the motion picture film 1 has a predetermined size.
      <br/>
      More specifically, an audio data dot may have a size of 26.4 MU  * 24.1 MU  as, for example, shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The relationship between the dot size and the parity may be as shown in FIG. 6, wherein it is observed that as the dot size increases, the error rate becomes improved, and when the dot size is reduced, more parity data is appended or added.
      <br/>
      As further shown in FIG. 6, the error correction capability may be represented by a quadratic curve with the transverse dot size of 24.1 MU  as an apex.
      <br/>
      As a result, since the present invention records audio data dots having a size of 26.4 MU  * 24.1 MU , which size corresponds to the maximum error correcting capability, accurate reproduction of the audio data is facilitated.

    <p num="41">The operation of the reproducing apparatus for reproducing audio data for a motion picture film 1, is now explained.</p>
    <p num="42">
      On initiation of reproduction, the light emitting diodes 2L, 2R are driven for pulse lighting by a LED driving circuit 16, in a manner as explained subsequently.
      <br/>
      This causes the red-hued light to be radiated on the digital sound tracks 20R, 20L on the motion picture film 1.
      <br/>
      The red-hued light is radiated on the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R via the digital sound tracks 20R, 20L as the reproducing light indicating audio data of the respective channels.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Upon initiating reproduction, the CCD line sensor 5L and the CCD line sensor 5R read the audio data recorded on the digital sound tracks 20 and 20.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the CCD line sensor 20L reads out the left route audio data line by line towards the picture region 24 from the left edge 1L in a direction normal or at right angles to the film running direction (see FIG. 9) and supplies the read data to the demodulator 9L.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the CCD line sensor 5R reads out the right route audio data line by line towards the picture region 24 from the right edge 1R in a direction at right angles to the film running direction (see FIG. 6) and supplies the read data to the demodulator 6R.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      As previously described, tracking patterns or like data are recorded in each of the digital sound tracks 20L, 20R and the CCD line sensors 5L and 5R respectively read out data from the film edges 1L and 1R.
      <br/>
      As a result, data such as the tracking patterns may be read without being obstructed by the perforations 23L and 23R in order to assure correct data reproduction.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      As is to be appreciated, if tracking patterns are recorded on both sides of each data track, tracking error correction capability may be increased.
      <br/>
      However, in such situation, the audio data recording region is reduced since the tracking patterns are provided on both sides of the data tracks.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the tracking patterns 53a and 53b are preferably provided only at one side of the digital sound tracks 5L and 5R so that a relatively wider audio data recording region may be obtained thereby increasing the amount of audio data which may be recorded as compared to the situation in which tracking patterns are recorded on both sides.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The demodulators 6L and 6R respectively demodulate the left and right route audio data and supply the demodulated data to the error correction circuits 7L and 7R.
      <br/>
      The error correction circuit 7L performs error correction on the left route audio data by utilizing the C1 parity and C2 parity.
      <br/>
      The error correction circuit 7L forms an error flag if such error correction cannot be performed and provides such error flag to the error correction circuit 13.
      <br/>
      The error correction circuit 7L provides error-corrected data to the delay memory 8.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the error correction circuit 7R performs error correction on the right route audio data using the C1 parity and C2 parity and provides the error-corrected data to the demultiplexor 9R while forming an error flag if such correction cannot be performed and provides the error flag to the error correction circuit 13.

      As previously described, scratches, such as longitudinal scratches extending in the film running direction and transverse scratches extending at right angles to the film running direction, may be generated on the motion picture film 1.
      <br/>
      Longitudinal scratches tend to be produced more frequently than the transverse scratches as the film 1 is used repeatedly.
      <br/>
      As a result, if the audio data is recorded in a direction at right angles to the film running direction on the digital sound tracks of the motion picture film, audio data may be destroyed for several lines by the longitudinal scratches.
      <br/>
      However, since each audio data of the present invention is recorded at an interval of a predetermined amount such as 1 byte along the film running direction, as described above, and the byte-based audio data is recorded side-by-side in a direction at right angles to the film ruining direction, longitudinal scratch may destroy only a minimum quantity of audio data, such as one byte.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, longitudinal scratches, which occur more frequently with the repeated use of the film 1, can be coped with successfully.
      <br/>
      Further, error correction in a direction at right angles to the film running direction and error correction for the longitudinal scratches can be performed by utilizing the C1 parity.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, error corrections utilizing the C2 parity may be performed for correcting errors caused by transverse scratches or hardly read out data when defocusing.
      <br/>
      As a result, the audio data from the motion picture film 1 may be properly reproduced therefrom by use of the present motion picture reproducing apparatus.

    <p num="66">Thus, the respective data may be read out while tracking correction is executed so that the readout timing of the CCD line sensor 5L is substantially in the just-tracking state at all times.</p>
    <p num="67">
      In the motion picture film 1 of the present invention, the tracking patterns 53a and 53b are recorded on only one of the sides of the digital sound tracks 20L and 20R so as to increase the data area, as previously described.
      <br/>
      However, if the tracking error is recorded on only one of the sides of the digital sound tracks 20L and 20R, tracking error correction capability may be lowered.
      <br/>
      However, since the azimuth check pattern 56 is recorded on a film block basis and the tracking error is corrected based upon each detection output of the tracking patterns 53a and 53b and the tilt detection pattern 56, recording the tracking patterns 53a and 53b on only one of the sides as described above does not lower the tracking error correction capability and increases the recording area for the audio data.
    </p>
    <p num="68">The audio data are recorded line-by-line in a direction at right angles to the film proceeding direction, with the line-by-line repetition frequency being e.g., 20 kHz. The one-line audio data is adapted to pass before the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R over e.g., 50  MU sec.</p>
    <p num="69">
      The CCD line sensors 5L, 5R cannot correctly read out data at the boundary between data lines.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the film dot image becomes blurred at the boundary region due to limitations in the resolution of the film itself and limitations in the objective lenses 3L, 3R, 4L and 4R.
      <br/>
      Thus the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R can correctly read out data only at a mid-portion of the dot image.
    </p>
    <p num="70">Consequently, the synchronization detection circuit 15 detects synchronization data 55 shown e.g., in FIG. 4 from the playback output of the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R and routes the detected output to the LED driving circuit 16 and to the CCD driving circuit 14.</p>
    <p num="71">When fed with a detection output of the synchronization data, the LED driving circuit 16 drives the light emitting diodes 2L, 2R for pulses lighting so that the light emitting diodes are lighted (turned on) only during a mid time interval of 10  MU sec of the total time period of 50  MU sec during which the data lines are passed before the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R, as shown in FIG. 8a. This causes the playback light of the respective audio data to be radiated on the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R only during the mid time interval of 10  MU sec.</p>
    <p num="72">On the other hand, the CCD driving circuit 14, when fed with the detection output of the synchronization data, transmits a readout pulse to the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R at a timing directly after the light emitting diodes 2L, 2R are driven for pulsed lighting, as shown in FIG. 8b.</p>
    <p num="73">Thus it becomes possible to extract only the mid-portion of the dot image of the respective audio data (the imaging signal formed during the 10  MU sec period) in synchronism with the data lines, as shown in FIG. 8c, in order to reproduce and output correct audio data.</p>
    <p num="74">
      Such high-speed driving for pulsed lighting is enabled by employing the above light emitting diodes 2L, 2R as the light sources.
      <br/>
      Thus it becomes possible to provide the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R not having the electronic shutter function.
      <br/>
      That is, the charge accumulation time of the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R can be adjusted by intermittent driving of the light emitting diodes 2L, 2R for pulsed lighting, thus rendering it possible to improve the error rate by preventing the noise from being superimposed on reproduced audio data by fluctuations in the charge drain quantity such as are produced when employing the electronic shutter function.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      Each of the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R exhibits high sensitivity of the light having the wavelength of 600 to 800 nm, as shown by a solid line in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the red-hued light radiated from the light emitting diodes 2L, 2R exhibits high sensitivity at a wavelength of 600 nm, as indicated by a broken line in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Thus the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R are able to radiate the playback light of high sensitivity.
      <br/>
      Although the light emitting diode has a smaller light volume than the halogen lamp, the CCD line sensors are able to radiate the light of high sensitivity through the use of the red-hued light emitting diodes.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Thus the audio data can be reproduced without regard to the light volume and the power consumption may be lower than when employing the halogen lamp.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, since the light emitting diode is small-sized and scarcely evolves heat, there is no necessity of providing heat dissipating means, so that the reproducing apparatus may be reduced in size and in production cost.
    </p>
    <p num="77">In addition, the light emitting diode has long service life and is not in need of maintenance or management thus enabling improved operating reliability of the apparatus.</p>
    <p num="78">
      The ID codes indicating the names of the film manufacturers or the like and the audio data, which are recorded in superposition on the respective digital sound tracks 20R, 20L, are recorded in red and blue hues, respectively.
      <br/>
      Consequently, by radiating the red-hued light on the motion picture film from the light emitting diodes 2L, 2R, the playback light for the ID code cannot be sensed by the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the playback light for the audio data can be radiated as the black-hued playback light on the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R.
      <br/>
      Consequently, despite the fact that the ID code and the audio data are recorded in superposition on the digital sound tracks 20R, 20L, the audio data can be exclusively reproduced without being affected by the ID codes.
    </p>
    <p num="79">Although the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R not having the electronic shutter function are employed in the above-described embodiment, the same effect may be achieved by providing the CCD line sensors having the electronic shutter function and by not activating the electronic shutter function during reproduction.</p>
    <p num="80">Although the respective data is 24.1  MU m in transverse size, the data dot size may naturally be changed if it is on the order of 24  MU m, such as 23.9  MU m, 24.0  MU m or 24.2  MU m.</p>
    <p num="81">
      With the above-described audio data reproducing apparatus for a motion picture film, since each line of the audio data for the respective channels on the digital sound tracks 20R, 20L on the motion picture film 1 is passed through a region in front of the CCD line sensors 5L, 5R within 50  MU sec, each line audio data needs to be read by the CD line sensors 5l 5R within the light receiving time not longer than 50  MU sec.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, the light receiving time is set so as to be equal to 10  MU sec by driving he light emitting diodes 2L and 2R for pulsed lighting.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a larger light volume is necessitated in order to produce an output with a high S/N ratio by the CCD line sensors 5L and 5R.
      <br/>
      If such sufficient light volume cannot be produced by the light emitting diodes 2L and 2R, plural light emitting diodes may be employed for producing the sufficient light volume, as in the case of the light source shown in FIG. 14.
    </p>
    <p num="82">The light source shown in FIG. 14 includes three light emitting diodes 101A, 101B and 101C and an optical fiber 103 on a light input 103a of which the light emitting diodes are mounted via a holder 102.</p>
    <p num="83">The three light emitting diodes 101A, 101B and 101C are held by the holder 102 so that the first light emitting diode 101A radiates the readout light to the light input 103a along the optical axis of the optical fiber 103 and the second and third light emitting diodes 101B and 101C radiate the readout light to the light input 103a from oblique directions intersecting the optical axis of the optical fiber 103.</p>
    <p num="84">With the above-described light source 100, the optical fiber 103 guides the readout light incident from the three light emitting diodes 101A, 101B and 101C on the light input 103a to a light output 103b, so that the readout light is radiated via the light output 103b on the digital sound track of the motion picture film, that is the information recording medium.</p>
    <p num="85">
      The readout light incident on the light input 103a from the first light emitting diode 101A along the optical axis of the optical fiber 103 is radiated from the light output 103b along the optical axis of the optical fiber 103.
      <br/>
      The readout light incident on the light input 103a from the second and third light emitting diodes 101B and 101C from oblique directions intersecting the optical axis of the optical fiber 103 is radiated from the light output 103b in the oblique directions intersecting the optical axis of the optical fiber 103.
    </p>
    <p num="86">Thus the readout light having a certain spreading extent may be radiated from the light output 103b of the optical fiber 103 onto the digital sound track of the motion picture film.</p>
    <p num="87">For radiating the readout light having certain spreading extent from the light output 103b of the optical fiber 103 on the digital sound track of the motion picture film, it suffices to provide at least two light emitting diodes for radiating the readout light to the light input 103a of the optical fiber 103 from the direction along the optical axis and from an oblique direction with respect to the optical axis.</p>
    <p num="88">By radiating the readout light having a certain spreading extent from the light output 103b of the light fiber 103 to the digital sound track of the motion picture film for reading audio data by the CCD line sensor, it becomes possible to reduce adverse effects of scratches or contaminations on the film by random reflection at the scratches or contaminations for reducing the readout error.</p>
    <p num="89">The light contributing to the readout output by the CCD line sensor is the readout light radiated from the light output 103b of the optical fiber 103 along the optical axis, or the readout light incident on the light input 103a by the first light emitting diode 101A from the direction along the optical axis of the optical fiber 103.</p>
    <p num="90">Thus, with the light source for reading out optical data according to the present invention, the light input 103a of the optical fiber 103 is branched into e.g., four light input sections 103a1 to 103a4 and first light emitting diodes 101A1 to 101A4 and second and third light emitting diodes 101B1 to 101B4 and 101C1 to 101C4 are attached via a holder 110 to the light input sections 103a1 to 103a4 for increasing the amount of the readout light radiated from the light output 103b of the optical fiber 103 along the optical axis, as shown in FIG. 15.</p>
    <p num="91">
      The optical fiber 103 is a bundle of, for example, 8000 individual optical fibers, from which four groups each having 2000 individual optical fibers are branched at the light input 103a.
      <br/>
      The optical fiber 103 has its four groups of the individual optical fibers interchanged in a random manner as the optical fiber 103 reaches the light output 103b.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      With the above-described light source, the readout light is incident on the four light input sections 103a1 to 103a4 of the optical fiber 103 from the first light emitting diodes 101A1 to 101A4 and the second and third light emitting diodes 101B1 to 101B4 and 101C1 to 101C4 so that the readout light with a sufficient amount of light and a certain spreading extent may be radiated from the light output 103b of the optical fiber 103 to the digital sound track of the motion picture film.
      <br/>
      This permits reduction in the readout error caused by scratches or contaminations on the motion picture film.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      By interchanging the groups of the individual optical fibers in a random manner between the four light input sections 103a1 to 103a4 and the light output 103b of the optical fiber 3, the readout light with the uniform light volume and the spreading extent may be radiated from the light output 103b to the digital sound track of the motion picture film.
      <br/>
      By uniforming the light volume of the readout light radiated with the spreading extent from the light output 103b, the stable readout light may be produced by the CCD line sensors.
    </p>
    <p num="94">Meanwhile, by changing the current supplied to the first light emitting diodes 101A1 to 101A4 and second and third light emitting diodes 101B1 to 101B4 and 101C1 to 101C4 for adjusting the respective light intensities, it becomes possible to further uniform the volume of the readout light radiated from the light output 103b with certain spreading extent.</p>
