      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a recording apparatus such as an ink jet recording apparatus and a thermal transfer recording apparatus.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      With conventional recording apparatus such as ink jet recording apparatus and thermal transfer recording apparatus, the diameters of a plurality of lots printed on a print medium are varied to provide gradation.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, the recording head is driven for different time lengths in accordance with print data to control sizes of ink drops ejected from the orifices or amounts of ink thermally transferred to the print medium.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      For conventional ink jet recording apparatus, controlling the ink drop size alone cannot provide an adequate size ratio of a minimum dot to a maximum dot to provide a desired gradation.
      <br/>
      In order to overcome this drawback, acoustic vibration of the ink channel is utilized to eject more than one ink drop successively, which merge into a single large drop before landing on the print medium.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The aforementioned conventional recording apparatus use fixed drive frequencies.
      <br/>
      If the recording head is driven a longer time for a larger ink drop or driven more than one time for improved gradation, the overall printing time is longer.
      <br/>
      This leads to a lower printing speed.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">An object of the present invention is to provide a recording apparatus which is driven at a high drive frequency to obtain an increased printing speed.</p>
    <p num="8">
      A recording apparatus comprises a lot data generator that generates dot data from print data and outputs the dot data.
      <br/>
      A drive frequency setting section sets a drive frequency in accordance with print data.
      <br/>
      A drive signal generator receives the drive frequency setting signal and generates a drive signal having drive times and timings for driving a recording head.
      <br/>
      The drive times change in accordance with the dot data and the timings are in timed relation with the drive frequency.
      <br/>
      The recording head is driven by the drive signal to form a plurality of dots on a print, medium.
      <br/>
      The dots have different diameters according to the drive time.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The recording apparatus further comprising a mode selector which selects a printing mode in accordance with a specified resolution of the print data.
      <br/>
      The drive frequency setting section sets the drive frequency in accordance with the selected printing mode.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The recording apparatus still includes an operation circuit which determines a total drive time for which the recording head is driven to form dots corresponding to the dot data.
      <br/>
      The operation circuit determines the total drive time on a line-by-line basis and the drive frequency setting section sets the drive frequency on a line-by-line basis.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The drive signal generator may give a delay to the timing, so that the ink drops land on predetermined locations on the print medium 44 even when the drive frequency varies from line to line.</p>
    <p num="12">
      The recording head includes a first channel holding a more frequently used ink therein and a second channel holding a less frequently used ink therein.
      <br/>
      The first channel has a longer channel length than the second channel.
      <br/>
      The drive frequency setting section sets a higher drive frequency for the channel holding the more frequently used ink.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      An adjacent dot detector determines whether adjacent dots in the dot data are of different colors.
      <br/>
      If the adjacent dots are of different colors, a gradation comparator determines whether a gradation level of one of the colors is higher than a predetermined setting.
    </p>
    <p num="14">A gradation converter converts gradation levels higher than the predetermined setting to a lower gradation level and the drive frequency setting section sets the drive frequency in accordance with the conversion of gradation.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The recording apparatus includes a speed setting section which sets a scanning speed of the recording head in a main scanning direction.
      <br/>
      Another second setting section sets a scanning speed of the recording head in a sub scanning direction.
      <br/>
      These scanning speeds are determined in accordance with the timing.

      Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">The present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="19">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="20">FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a control system for an ink jet recording apparatus of a first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring to FIG. 1, a controller 29 controls the printing operation of the ink jet recording apparatus.
      <br/>
      A dot data generator 30 receives print data from a host apparatus, not shown, and generates dot data from the received print data.
      <br/>
      The dot data generator 30 also generates a printing mode specifying signal from a command received from the host apparatus.
      <br/>
      A mode selector 23 receives the printing mode specifying signal from the dot data generator 30 and generates a mode signal for selecting either a low-resolution mode or a high-resolution mode.
      <br/>
      In the low-resolution mode, images such as characters and symbols are printed at a resolution of 300 dpi.
      <br/>
      In the high-resolution mode, images such as photographs are printed at a resolution of 600 dpi.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A drive frequency setting section 24 receives the mode signal and sets a drive frequency for a resolution specified by the mode signal.
      <br/>
      From the drive frequency, a drive signal generator 25 generates a drive signal having drive times and timings for driving a color ink jet head 28.
      <br/>
      The drive times are in accordance with the dot data and determine the sizes of dots to be printed on a print medium.
      <br/>
      A head driver 27 generates drive voltages in accordance with the drive signal to drive the color ink jet head 28.
      <br/>
      A motor driver 31 sets a scan speed in a main scanning direction in accordance with the timings, and controls a spacing motor 32 to the specified scan speed.
      <br/>
      A motor 33 sets a scan speed in a sub-scanning direction in accordance with the timings and controls a line feed motor 34 to the specified scan speed.
      <br/>
      The spacing motor 32 moves the ink jet head 28 back and forth across a print medium, not shown, in the main scanning direction while the line feed motor 34 causes the print medium to advance in the sub-scanning direction.
      <br/>
      The color ink jet head 28 is capable of forming a plurality of dots on the print medium, the dots having different diameters in accordance with the drive times in the drive signal.
      <br/>
      In the first embodiment, a monochrome ink jet head may be used in place of the color ink jet head 28.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The mode selector 23 may be designed to select the print mode in accordance with a command which is input from an operating panel, not shown.</p>
    <p num="24">FIG. 2 illustrates an ink jet head 28 ejecting a small ink drop 17a.</p>
    <p num="25">FIG. 3 is a timing chart for the operations shown in FIGS. 2, 4, and 5.</p>
    <p num="26">FIG. 4 illustrates the ink jet, head 28 ejecting a large ink drop.</p>
    <p num="27">FIG. 5 illustrates the ink jet head 28 ejecting a plurality of ink drops 17c and 17d in succession.</p>
    <p num="28">FIG. 6 illustrates the ink jet head 28 of the first embodiment in its inoperative state.</p>
    <p num="29">FIG. 7 is an enlarged view of a relevant portion of FIG. 6.</p>
    <p num="30">
      Referring to FIG. 2, a housing 11 has a plurality of channels 21.
      <br/>
      Each channel 21 has a first opening 11a at a front thereof (right ends in FIGS. 2, 4, 5, and 6), a second opening 11b on a top thereof, and a third opening 11c at a bottom thereof.
      <br/>
      The first, opening 11a is closed by an orifice plate 15 and the second opening 11b is closed by a diaphragm 12.
      <br/>
      The diaphragm 12 has a piezoelectric element 13 sandwiched between electrodes 14a and 14b.
      <br/>
      A predetermined drive voltage VD is applied across the electrodes 14a and 14b for a predetermined time length, so that the piezoelectric element 1:3 is driven to deform the diaphragm 12.
      <br/>
      The deformed diaphragm 12 imposes a pressure oil the ink in the ink channel 21.
      <br/>
      The drive voltage VD is fed via terminals 19a and 19b.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Each orifice plate 15 is formed with orifices 16 therein.
      <br/>
      When the ink in the channel 21 is pressurized, ink drops are ejected through the orifices 16 to form dots on a print medium, not shown.
      <br/>
      The third opening 11c communicates with an ink tank, not shown, so that the ink from the ink tank is introduced through the third opening 11c into a common ink chamber 22.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The operation of the ink jet head 28 will now be described.</p>
    <p num="33">
      As shown in FIG. 3, when the drive voltage VD is applied across the electrodes 14a and 14b for a minimum drive time t1 via the terminals 19a and 19b, the piezoelectric element 13 causes the diaphragm 12 to deform as depicted by a dotted line in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Thus, the ink in the channel 21 is pressurized and an ink drop having a minimum size is ejected through the orifice 16 to form a dot having a diameter d1 on the print medium.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      When the drive voltage VD is applied across the electrodes 14a and 14b for a maximum time length t2, an ink drop 17b having a maximum size is ejected through the orifice 16 shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The ink drop 17b lands onto the print medium to form a dot having a diameter d2 larger than a diameter d1.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      When a still larger dot having a diameter d3 is needed, the piezoelectric element 13 is driven more than one time for a short time length using acoustic vibration of the ink.
      <br/>
      For example, the drive voltage VD is applied for a time length t3, then after a short time length t4, again applied for a time length t5.
      <br/>
      Thus, the ink drops 17c and 17d are ejected in succession as shown in FIG. 5, the second driving (i.e., t5) of the piezoelectric element 13 being in timed relation with the acoustic vibration of ink.
      <br/>
      In other words, the second ejection is effected just when a meniscus 18 extends in an ejection direction, so that the second ink drop 17d is ejected at a higher speed than the first ink drop 17c.
      <br/>
      As a result, the ink drops 17c and 17d merge into a single drop before they land on the print medium, thereby forming a dot having a diameter d3 larger than d2.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Then, the drive voltage VD is removed so that the ink jet head 28 is in an inoperative state as shown in FIG. 6, and the meniscus 18 is formed in the orifice 16 as shown in FIG. 7.</p>
    <p num="37">If the channel 21 has a length L1 and the piezoelectric element 13 has a length L2, the length L1 determines the frequency of acoustic vibration.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The acoustic resonance frequency of the channel 21 increases with decreasing the length L1, allowing driving of the ink jet head 28 at higher speeds.
      <br/>
      However, the length L2 becomes shorter with decreasing length L1 so that the pressure applied to the ink in the channel 21 decreases and ink drops become smaller correspondingly.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      A method of driving an ink jet head is referred to as "single-drop method" if a single ink drop, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, is ejected from the channel to form a single dot.
      <br/>
      A method of driving an ink jet head is referred to as "double-drop method" if ink drops are ejected from the channel 21 as shown in FIG. 5 to form a single dot.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      FIG. 8 illustrates the relationship among drive times, diameters of dots, and drive frequencies.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 plots the drive time of the piezoelectric element 13 as the abscissa and drive frequency and the diameter of dot as the ordinate.
    </p>
    <p num="41">Referring to FIG. 8, Curve Q1 shows the relationship between the drive frequency and the drive time length of the piezoelectric element 13, and Curve Q2 shows the relationship between the dot diameter and the drive time length of the piezoelectric element 13.</p>
    <p num="42">
      For example, driving the piezoelectric element 13 for a minimum drive time length t1 results in a dot diameter d1 which assumes a drive frequency f1.
      <br/>
      Similarly, driving the piezoelectric element 13 for a maximum drive time length t2 results in a dot diameter d2 which assumes a drive frequency f2.
      <br/>
      Driving the piezoelectric element 13 for successive drive time lengths t3 and t5 results in a dot diameter d3 which assumes a drive frequency f3.
      <br/>
      Time a is a time required for the pressure of the ink in the channel 21 to decay after the piezoelectric element 13 is driven.
      <br/>
      Thus, the time required for ejecting one ink drop is drive time length plus time  ALPHA .
      <br/>
      The dot diameters d1 and d2 are formed by the single-drop method while the dot diameter d3 is formed by the double-drop method.

    <p num="46">Therefore, if the drive frequency is set to the drive frequency f3 (=4.5 kHz) by the drive frequency setting section 24 (FIG. 1), the ink jet head 28 can perform a printing with gradation using dots in the range of 30-100  MU m, which dots can be formed by selecting the drive time in the range from t1 to t3+t4+t5.</p>
    <p num="47">
      With the conventional ink jet recording apparatus, when a printing is performed at a resolution of 600 dpi, the ink jet head 28 must be moved at reduced speeds in the main seanning and sub-scanning directions, the speeds being halves of those when a printing operation is performed at a resolution of 300 dpi.
      <br/>
      Thus, the overall printing speed for 600 dpi becomes one-fourth that for 300 dpi. for example, if the printing speed of the conventional ink jet recording apparatus is 4 PPM (page per minute) when a printing is performed at a resolution of 300 dpi, then the printing speed becomes 1 PPM when a printing is performed at a resolution of 600 dpi.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In the first embodiment, dot diameters are directly determined by a desired resolution (300 dpi or 600 dpi).

      Thus, the drive time length and drive method are selected according to the dot diameter which automatically assumes a drive frequency.

      Thus, when printing with a 300 dpi resolution, the head driver 27 (FIG. 1) controls the drive time length of the head 28 such that the ink jet head 28 is driven at a drive frequency of f3 (=4.5 kHz) to form dots having the dot diameter to d3 (=100  MU m).
      <br/>
      Similarly, when printing with a 600 dpi resolution, the head driver 27 controls the drive time length of the head 28 such that the ink jet head 28 is driven at a drive frequency of f2 (=6.7 kHz) lo form dots having the dot diameter to d2 (=60  MU m).

    <p num="53">As noted above, the drive frequency for the 600 dpi resolution is about 1.5 times (6.7 kHz/4.5 kHz=1.488) that for the 300 dpi, and accordingly the printing speed is 1.5 PPM, i.e., 1.5 times faster than the conventional ink jet recording apparatus where a single drive frequency is used for both the 600 dpi resolution and 300 dpi resolution.</p>

      As mentioned above, the dot diameter is changed in accordance with a desired resolution and the drive frequency is changed correspondingly.

      If the recording head 46 (FIG. 18) takes the form of an ink jet head 53, a change in drive frequency causes a change in the speed of the spacing motor 32.

      As a result, the speed of a carriage, not shown, on which the ink jet head 53 is carried will also change.

      <br/>
      The distance La changes with changes in drive frequency and carriage speed.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the drive frequency is changed from line to line, then the print position on the print medium 44 on which the ink drop 54 lands varies from line to line.
      <br/>
      This impairs the print quality.

    <p num="89">
      Thus, in order that the ink drop 54 lands on predetermined locations on the print medium 44 even when the drive frequency varies from line to line, the ink drops 54 should be ejected at different timings corresponding to the drive frequencies.

      Thus, the drive signal generator 25 generates reference timings which is a theoretical timing value, and drive timings which are actual timing values for driving the piezoelectric element 13 (FIG. 2).

      Just as in the first embodiment, the dot diameter is adjusted by changing the drive time of the piezoelectric element 13 and changing the number of ink (drops for each dot.

      When the length L1 of the channel 21 is changed, the dot diameter will change if the piezoelectric element 13 is driven for the same drive time length.
      <br/>
      In order to maintain the same dot diameter, the drive time must be changed and the drive frequency must be changed, accordingly.
      <br/>
      For example, we assume that characteristics shown in FIG. 10 are obtained for the length L1=LS, then

      <br/>
      Therefore, the black printing operation is performed at a resolution of 300 dpi.
      <br/>
      Colored inks are used mostly when printing images such as photographs.

      If the black head 55B has a length L1=LL, then the diameter of black dot ranges from 70 to 140  MU m. Thus, driving the piezoelectric element 13 in the single drop method provides the diameter d2 e.g., 100  MU m) which is required when printing at a resolution of 300 dpi.

      The drive frequency is f2 e.g., 5.4 kHz) for L1=LL and f3 e.g., 4.5 kHz) for L1=LS.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that the drive frequency is higher when L1=LL than when L1=LS.
      <br/>
      This implies that the black printing speed is higher when L1=LL than when L1=LS.

    <p num="99">
      The yellow, magenta, and cyan heads are designed to have the length L1=LS (&lt;LL).

      The gradation level comparator 58 then checks the average gradation level to determine whether the average gradation level is higher than a predetermined setting (for example, the setting is 10 if the ink jet recording apparatus has 16 gradation levels.)

      The drive times are in accordance with the dot data and determine the sizes of dots to be printed on a print medium.

      In the seventh embodiment, if the dot density is higher than a predetermined setting and the average gradation level of the print data is higher than a predetermined setting, the gradation levels of all the dot data are converted.

      FIG. 25 is a control block of a recording apparatus according to an eighth embodiment.
      <br/>
      FIG. 26 illustrates a dot, matrix having black dots 65B, yellow dots 65Y, magenta dots 65M, and cyan dots 65C before the conversion of gradation levels.
      <br/>
      FIG. 27 shows a dot matrix having black dots 65B, yellow dots 65Y, magenta dots 65M, and cyan dots 65C after the conversion of gradation levels.
      <br/>
      The same reference numerals have been given to elements similar to those in the fourth embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      Referring to FIG. 25, a controller 61 controls the printing operation of a recording apparatus of the eighth embodiment.
      <br/>
      A dot data generator 30 receives print data from a host apparatus, not shown, and generates dot data from the print data.
      <br/>
      A line buffer 51 receives dot data for a plurality of lines from the dot data generator 30.
      <br/>
      An adjacent-dot detector 62 checks the dot data stored in the line buffer 51 to determine whether adjacent dots are of different colors.
      <br/>
      In other words, a check is made to determine whether black dots are to be formed at a position next to colored dots.
      <br/>
      A gradation level comparator 63 performs an operation to find a gradation level of one of adjacent dots when the adjacent dots are a black dot and a colored dot, and then determines whether the gradation level is higher than a predetermined setting.
      <br/>
      A gradation level converter 64 converts the gradation level of the dot, e.g., black dot, having a gradation level higher than the predetermined setting, in accordance with the decisions of the adjacent-dot detector 62 and gradation level comparator 63.
      <br/>
      If it is determined that the one of the adjacent dots has a gradation level less than the predetermined setting, then the gradation level comparator 63 performs an operation to find a gradation level of the other of the adjacent dots.
      <br/>
      Then, the gradation level converter 64 converts the gradation level of the dot if the dot has a gradation level higher than the predetermined setting.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      A drive frequency setting section 24 determines a drive frequency from the decisions made by the gradation level Comparator 63 and gradation level converter 64, and outputs a frequency setting signal.
      <br/>
      A drive signal generator 25 generates a drive signal having drive times and timings.
      <br/>
      The timings are in timed relation with the drive frequency.
      <br/>
      The drive times are in accordance with the dot data and determine the sizes of dots to be printed on a print medium.
    </p>
    <p num="111">When black dot is to be formed adjacent other colored dots and has a gradation level higher than a predetermined setting, the gradation level converter 64 converts the gradation level or the black dot to a lower level, and sends the dot data having the lower gradation level to the recording head 46 via the head driver 27.</p>
    <p num="112">As a result, dots printed on the print medium are those shown in FIG. 27 rather than those shown in FIG. 26. It is to be noted that the black dots 66B adjacent the colored dots 65Y and 65M are smaller than the colored dots after the conversion of gradation level and therefore the black dots 66B do not overlap the adjacent colored dots.</p>
    <p num="113">The drive frequency setting section 24 sets a higher drive frequency corresponding to a decrease in the gradation level of the black dots 65B.</p>
    <p num="114">
      While the embodiment has been described with reference to the lowering of gradation level of the black dots 65B, the gradation levels of the yellow dots 65Y, magenta dots 65M, and cyan dots (65C may be decreased instead.
      <br/>
      Still alternatively, the gradations of all of the dots may be decreased.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      When the embodiment is applied to an ink jet recording apparatus, ink drop size becomes smaller with decreasing gradation level, preventing the print medium from becoming wrinkled and the ink from spreading and drying too slowly.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the black ink drop is not mixed with the colored dots and therefore increasing print quality.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways.
      <br/>
      Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.
