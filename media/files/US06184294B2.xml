      This application is a national application of International Application No. PCT/US 97/15533 filed on Sep. 4, 1997, claiming priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 60/025,431, filed on Sep. 4, 1996, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

    <heading>STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT</heading>
    <p num="2">Not applicable.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">The present invention pertains to blends (A) of interpolymers made from monomer components comprising at least one  ALPHA -olefin and at least one aromatic vinylidene monomer and/or at least one hindered aliphatic vinylidene monomer and/or at least one cycloaliphatic vinylidene monomer and (B) olefinic polymers.</p>
    <p num="4">The generic class of materials covered by  ALPHA -olefin/hindered vinylidene monomer substantially random interpolymers and including materials such as  ALPHA -olefin/vinyl aromatic monomer interpolymers are known in the art and offer a range of material structures and properties which makes them useful for varied applications, such as compatibilizers for blends of polyethylene and polystyrene as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,818.</p>
    <p num="5">
      One particular aspect described by D'Anniello et al. (Journal of Applied Polymer Science, Volume 58, pages 1701-1706 (1995)) is that such interpolymers can show good elastic properties and energy dissipation characteristics.
      <br/>
      In another aspect, selected interpolymers can find utility in adhesive systems, as illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,244,996, issued to Mitsui Petrochemical Industries Ltd.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Although of utility in their own right, Industry is constantly seeking to improve the applicability of these interpolymers, for example to extend the temperature range of application.
      <br/>
      Such enhancements may be accomplished via additives, but it is desirable to develop technologies to provide improvements in processability or performance without the addition of additives or further improvements than can be achieved with the addition of additives.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Park et al., in WO 95/27755 describes a method of increasing the toughness and solvent resistance of a homopolymer or interpolymer of a monovinylidene aromatic monomer, by blending it with an olefin polymer such as a polyethylene or ethylene/octene copolymer.
      <br/>
      However because of the incompatability of these two types of resins, there is a requirement for a compatabilizer which Park teaches can be a pseudo random interpolymer of an aliphatic  ALPHA -olefin and a vinylidene aromatic monomer.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Bradfute et al., in WO 95/32095 discloses multilayer films having at least one layer which is an ethylene/styrene copolymer.</p>
    <p num="9">
      McKay et al., in WO 96/07681 describes a thermoset elastomer comprising a crosslinked pseudorandom or substantially random interpolymer of at least one  ALPHA -olefin, at least one vinylidene aromatic compound, and at least one diene.
      <br/>
      The subject invention also provides a thermoplastic vulcanizate comprising the thermoset elastomer as provided in a themoplastic polyolefin matrix.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      There is a need to provide materials based on  ALPHA -olefin/vinylidene aromatic monomer interpolymers with superior performance characteristics to the unmodified polymers, which will further expand the utility of this interesting class of materials.
      <br/>
      This superior characteristics include, but are not limited to, low temperature toughness, mechanical strength and melt processability.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The present invention pertains to a fabricated article other than a film comprising a blend of polymeric materials consisting of</p>
    <p num="12">(A) from 1 to 99 weight percent of one or more  ALPHA -olefin/vinylidene monomer non-crosslinked substantially random interpolymers, wherein the distribution of the monomers of said interpolymers can be described by the Bernoulli statistical model or by a first or second order Markovian statistical model, and each having been made from monomer components comprising:</p>
    <p num="13">- (1) from 0.5 to 65 mole percent of either</p>
    <p num="14">
      -  (a) at least one vinylidene aromatic monomer, or

      -  (b) at least one hindered aliphatic vinylidene monomer, corresponding to the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
      <br/>
      -   wherein A1 is a sterically bulky, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic substituent of up to 20 carbons, R1 is selected from the group of radicals consisting of hydrogen and alkyl radicals containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably hydrogen or methyl; each R2 is independently selected from the group of radicals consisting of hydrogen and alkyl radicals containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably hydrogen or methyl; or alternatively R1 and A1 together form a ring system or
      <br/>
      -  (c) a combination of at least one vinylidene aromatic monomer and at least one hindered aliphatic vinylidene monomer; and
      <br/>
      - (2) from 35 to 99.5 mole percent of at least one aliphatic  ALPHA -olefin having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms; and
      <br/>
      (B) from 99 to 1 weight percent of one or more homopolymers or copolymers of monomer components comprising aliphatic  ALPHA -olefins having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, or aliphatic  ALPHA -olefins having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms and containing polar groups.

      These interpolymers contain additional signals with intensities greater than three times the peak to peak noise.
      <br/>
      These signals appear in the chemical shift range 43.70-44.25 ppm and 38.0-38.5 ppm. Specifically, major peaks are observed at 44.1, 43.9 and 38.2 ppm. A proton test NMR experiment indicates that the signals in the chemical shift region 43.70-44.25 ppm are methine carbons and the signals in the region 38.0-38.5 ppm are methylene carbons.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In order to determine the carbon-13 NMR chemical shifts of the interpolymers described, the following procedures and conditions are employed.
      <br/>
      A five to ten weight percent polymer solution is prepared in a mixture consisting of 50 volume percent 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d2 and 50 volume percent 0.10 molar chromium tris(acetylacetonate) in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene.
      <br/>
      NMR spectra are acquired at 130 (degree)  C. using an inverse gated decoupling sequence, a 90 (degree)  pulse width and a pulse delay of five seconds or more.
      <br/>
      The spectra are referenced to the isolated methylene signal of the polymer assigned at 30.000 ppm.

    <p num="41">
      It is believed that these new signals are due to sequences involving two head-to-tail vinyl aromatic monomer preceded and followed by at least one  ALPHA -olefin insertion, e.g. an ethylene/styrene/styrene/ethylene tetrad wherein the styrene monomer insertions of said tetrads occur exclusively in a 1,2 (head to tail) manner.
      <br/>
      It is understood by one skilled in the art that for such tetrads involving a vinyl aromatic monomer other than styrene and an  ALPHA -olefin other than ethylene that the ethylene/vinyl aromatic monomer/vinyl aromatic monomer/ethylene tetrad will give rise to similar carbon-13 NMR peaks but with slightly different chemical shifts.

    <p num="64">
      The present foam structure may be made by a conventional extrusion foaming process.
      <br/>
      The structure is generally prepared by heating an ethylenic polymer material to form a plasticized or melt polymer material, incorporating therein a blowing agent to form a foamable gel, and extruding the gel through a die to form the foam product.
      <br/>
      Prior to mixing with the blowing agent, the polymer material is heated to a temperature at or above its glass transition temperature or melting point.
      <br/>
      The blowing agent may be incorporated or mixed into the melt polymer material by any means known in the art such as with an extruder, mixer, or blender.
      <br/>
      The blowing agent is mixed with the melt polymer material at an elevated pressure sufficient to prevent substantial expansion of the melt polymer material and to generally disperse the blowing agent homogeneously therein.
      <br/>
      Optionally, a nucleator may be blended in the polymer melt or dry blended with the polymer material prior to plasticizing or melting.
      <br/>
      The foamable gel is typically cooled to a lower temperature to optimize physical characteristics of the foam structure.
      <br/>
      The gel is then extruded or conveyed through a die of desired shape to a zone of reduced or lower pressure to form the foam structure.
      <br/>
      The zone of lower pressure is at a pressure lower Ethan that in which the foamable gel is maintained prior to extrusion through the die.
      <br/>
      The lower pressure may be superatmospheric or subatmospheric (vacuum), but is preferably at an atmospheric level.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The present foam structure may be formed in a coalesced strand form by extrusion of the ethylenic polymer material through a multi-orifice die.
      <br/>
      The orifices are arranged so that contact between adjacent streams of the molten extrudate occurs during the foaming process and the contacting surfaces adhere to one another with sufficient adhesion to result in a unitary foam structure.
      <br/>
      The streams of molten extrudate exiting the die take the form of strands or profiles, which desirably foam, coalesce, and adhere to one another to form a unitary structure.
      <br/>
      Desirably, the coalesced individual strands or profiles should remain adhered in a unitary structure to prevent strand delamination under stresses encountered in preparing, shaping, and using the foam.
      <br/>
      Apparatuses and methods for producing foam structures in coalesced strand form are seen in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,573,152 and 4,824,720.
    </p>
    <p num="66">The present foam structure may also be formed by an accumulating extrusion process as seen in U.S. Pat. No. 4,323,528. In this process, low density foam structures having large lateral cross-sectional areas are prepared by: 1) forming under pressure a gel of the ethylenic polymer material and a blowing agent at a temperature at which the viscosity of the gel is sufficient to retain the blowing agent when the gel is allowed to expand; 2) extruding the gel into a holding zone maintained at a temperature and pressure which does not allow the gel to foam, the holding zone having an outlet die defining an orifice opening into a zone of lower pressure at which the gel foams, and an openable gate closing the die orifice; 3) periodically opening the gate; 4) substantially concurrently applying mechanical pressure by a movable ram on the gel to eject it from the holding zone through the die orifice into the zone of lower pressure, at a rate greater than that at which substantial foaming in the die orifice occurs and less than that at which substantial irregularities in cross-sectional area or shape occurs; and 5) permitting the ejected gel to expand unrestrained in at least one dimension to produce the foam structure.</p>
    <p num="67">
      The present foam structure may also be formed into non-crosslinked foam beads suitable for molding into articles.
      <br/>
      To make the foam beads, discrete resin particles such as granulated resin pellets-are: suspended in a liquid medium in which they are substantially insoluble such as water; impregnated with a blowing agent by introducing the blowing agent into the liquid medium at an elevated pressure and temperature in an autoclave or other pressure vessel; and rapidly discharged into the atmosphere or a region of reduced pressure to expand to form the foam beads.
      <br/>
      This process is well taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,379,859 and 4,464,484.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      In a derivative of the above process, styrene monomer may be impregnated into the suspended pellets prior to impregnation with blowing agent to form a graft interpolymer with the ethylenic polymer material.
      <br/>
      The polyethylene/polystyrene interpolymer beads are cooled and discharged from the vessel substantially unexpanded.
      <br/>
      The beads are then expanded and molded by the conventional expanded polystyrene bead molding process.
      <br/>
      The process of making the polyethylene/polystyrene interpolymer beads is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,168,353.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The foam beads may then be molded by any means known in the art, such as charging the foam beads to the mold, compressing the mold to compress the beads, and heating the beads such as with steam to effect coalescing and welding of the beads to form the article.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the beads may be impregnated with air or other blowing agent at an elevated pressure and temperature prior to charging to the mold.
      <br/>
      Further, the beads may be heated prior to charging.
      <br/>
      The foam beads may then be molded to blocks or shaped articles by a suitable molding method known in the art. (Some of the methods are taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,504,068 and 3,953,558.)

      Polymer is prepared in a 400 gallon (1.514 m3) agitated semi-continuous batch reactor.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture consisted of approximately 250 gallons (0.95 m3) of a solvent comprising a mixture of cyclohexane (85wt %) &amp; isopentane (15wt %), and styrene.
      <br/>
      Prior to addition, solvent, styrene and ethylene are purified to remove water and oxygen.
      <br/>
      The inhibitor in the styrene is also removed.
      <br/>
      Inerts are removed by purging the vessel with ethylene.
      <br/>
      The vessel is then pressure controlled to a set point with ethylene.
      <br/>
      Hydrogen is added to control molecular weight.
      <br/>
      Temperature in the vessel is controlled to set-point by varying the jacket water temperature on the vessel.
      <br/>
      Prior to polymerization, the vessel is heated to the desired run temperature and the catalyst components: Titanium: (N-1,1-dimethyl-ethyl)dimethyl(1-(1,2,3,4,5-eta)-2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-2,4-cyclopentadien-1-yl)silanaminato))(2-)N)-dimethyl, CAS- 135072-62-7, Tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron, CAS- 001109-15-5, Modified methylaluminoxane Type 3A, CAS- 146905-79-5, are flow controlled, on a mole ratio basis of 1/3/5 respectively, combined and added to the vessel.
      <br/>
      After starting, the polymerization is allowed to proceed with ethylene supplied to the reactor as required to maintain vessel pressure.
      <br/>
      In some cases, hydrogen is added to the headspace of the reactor to maintain a mole ratio with respect to the ethylene concentration.
      <br/>
      At the end of the run, the catalyst flow is stopped, ethylene is removed from the reactor, 1000 ppm of Irganox (tm)  PI 1010 anti-oxidant (a registered trademark of CIBA-GEIGY) is then added to the solution and the polymer is isolated from the solution.
      <br/>
      The resulting polymers are isolated from solution by either stripping with steam in a vessel or by use of a devolatilizing extruder.
      <br/>
      In the case of the steam stripped material, additional processing is required in extruder like equipment to reduce residual moisture and any unreacted styrene.

      ASTM-D638 samples are tested at a strain rate of 5 min.-1. The average of four tensile measurements is given.
      <br/>
      The yield stress and yield strain are recorded at the inflection point in the stress/strain curve.
      <br/>
      The Energy at break is the area under the stress/strain curve.

      Tensile Stress Relaxation: Uniaxial tensile stress relaxation was evaluated using an INSTRON (tm)  1145 tensile machine (a registered trademark of the Instron Corporation, Canton, Mass.).
      <br/>
      Compression molded film (.about.20 mil, 0.5 mm thick) with a 1" gauge length was deformed to a strain level of 50% at a strain rate of 20 min.-1. The force required to maintain 50% elongation was monitored for 10 min.
      <br/>
      The magnitude of the stress relaxation is defined as (fi -ff /fi) where fi is the initial force and ff is the final force.

      Thermomechanical Analysis (TMA): Data were generated using a Perkin Elmer TMA 7 series instrument.
      <br/>
      Probe penetration is measured to 1 mm depth on 2 mm thick compression molded parts using a heating rate of 5 (degree)  C./min and a load of 1 Newton.

    <p num="133">
      The apparatus (referred to as R-1) is set-up in the hood and purged with nitrogen; it consisted of a 10 L glass kettle with flush mounted bottom valve, 5-neck head, polytetrafluoroethylene gasket, clamp, and stirrer components (bearing, shaft, and paddle).
      <br/>
      The necks are equipped as follows: stirrer components are put on the center neck, and the outer necks had a reflux condenser topped with gas inlet/outlet, an inlet for solvent, a thermocouple, and a stopper.
      <br/>
      Dry, deoxygenated dimethoxyethane (DME) is added to the flask (approx. 5 L).
      <br/>
      In the drybox, 700 g of TiCl3 is weighed into an equalizing powder addition funnel; the funnel is capped, removed from the drybox, and put on the reaction kettle in place of the stopper.
      <br/>
      The TiCl3 is added over 10 minutes with stirring.
      <br/>
      After the addition is completed, additional DME is used to wash the rest of the TiCl3 into the flask.
      <br/>
      The addition funnel is replaced with a stopper, and the mixture heated to reflux.
      <br/>
      The color changed from purple to pale blue.
      <br/>
      The mixture is heated for 5 hours, cooled to room temperature, the solid is allowed to settle, and the supernatant is decanted from the solid.
      <br/>
      The TiCl3 (DME)1.5 is left in R-1 as a pale blue solid.

      The apparatus (referred to as R-2) is set-up as described for R-1, except that flask size is 30 L. The head is equipped with seven necks; stirrer in the center neck, and the outer necks containing condenser topped with nitrogen inlet/outlet, vacuum adapter, reagent addition tube, thermocouple, and stoppers.
      <br/>
      The flask is loaded with 4.5 L of toluene, 1.14 kg of (Me4 C5 H)SiMe2 NH-t-Bu, and 3.46 kg of 2 M i-PrMgCl in Et2 O. The mixture is then heated, and the ether allowed to boil off into a trap cooled to -78 (degree)  C. After four hours, the temperature of the mixture had reached 75 (degree)  C. At the end of this time, the heater is turned off and DME is added to the hot, stirring solution, resulting in the formation of a white solid.
      <br/>
      The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature, the material is allowed to settle, and the supernatant is decanted from the solid.

    <p num="135">
      The materials in R-1 and R-2 are slurried in DME (3 L of DME in R-1 and 5 L in R-2).
      <br/>
      The contents of R-1 are transferred to R-2 using a transfer tube connected to the bottom valve of the 10 L flask and one of the head openings in the 30 L flask.
      <br/>
      The remaining material in R-1 is washed over using additional DME.
      <br/>
      The mixture darkened quickly to a deep red/brown color, and the temperature in R-2 rose from 21 (degree)  C. to 32 (degree)  C. After 20 minutes, 160 mL of CH2 Cl2 is added through a dropping funnel, resulting in a color change to green/brown.
      <br/>
      This is followed by the addition of 3.46 kg of 3 M MeMgCl in THF, which caused a temperature increase from 22 (degree)  C. to 52 (degree)  C. The mixture is stirred for 30 minutes, then 6 L of solvent is removed under vacuum.
      <br/>
      Isopar E (6 L) is added to the flask.
      <br/>
      This vacuum/solvent addition cycle is repeated, with 4 L of solvent removed and 5 L of Isopar E added.
      <br/>
      In the final vacuum step, an additional 1.2 L of solvent is removed.
      <br/>
      The material is allowed to settle overnight, then the liquid layer decanted into another 30 L glass kettle (R-3).
      <br/>
      The solvent in R-3 is removed under vacuum to leave a brown solid, which is re-extracted with Isopar E; this material is transferred into a storage cylinder.
      <br/>
      Analysis indicated that the solution (17.23 L) is 0.1534 M in titanium; this is equal to 2.644 moles of �( ETA 5 -Me4 C5)SiMe2 N-t-Bu�TiMe2.
      <br/>
      The remaining solids in R-2 are further extracted with Isopar E, the solution is transferred to R-3, then dried under vacuum and re-extracted with Isopar E. This solution is transferred to storage bottles; analysis indicated a concentration of 0.1403 M titanium and a volume of 4.3 L (0.6032 moles �( ETA 5 -Me4 C5)SiMe2 N-t-Bu�TiMe2).
      <br/>
      This gives an overall yield of 3.2469 moles of �( ETA 5 -Me4 C5)SiMe2 N-t-Bu�TiMe2, or 1063 g. This is a 72% yield overall based on the titanium added as TiCl3.

    <p num="173">
      The equipment used in this example is a 38 mm (11/2") screw type extruder having additional zones of mixing and cooling at the end of usual sequential zones of feeding, metering, and mixing.
      <br/>
      An opening for blowing agent is provided on the extruder barrel between the metering and mixing zones.
      <br/>
      At the end of the cooling zone, there is attached a die orifice having an opening of rectangular shape.
      <br/>
      The height of the opening, hereinafter called the die gap, is adjustable while its width is fixed at 6.35 mm (0.25")
    </p>
    <p num="174">
      In this example, 80/20 and 60/40 blends of a low density polyethylene (LDPE) and an ES copolymer are expanded with isobutane blowing agent.
      <br/>
      For comparison, a foam is also prepared from the straight LDPE resin.
    </p>
    <p num="175">
      The granular polyethylene is preblended with a predetermined amount of the granular ES copolymer, a concentrate of glycerol monostearate (GMS) so that the effective GMS level could be 1.0 pph, and a small amount (approximately 0.02 pph) of talcum powder.
      <br/>
      GMS is added for foam dimensional stability and talcum powder is added for cell size control.
      <br/>
      The solid mixture is then fed into the hopper of the extruder and extruded at a uniform rate of 15 lb/hr) (6.8 kg/hr).
      <br/>
      The temperatures maintained at the extruder zones are 160 (degree)  C. at feeding zone, 177 (degree)  C. at transition zone, 188 (degree)  C. at melting zone, 193 (degree)  C. at metering zone and 177 (degree)  C. at mixing zone.
      <br/>
      Isobutane is injected into the injection port at a uniform rate so that the blowing agent level became approximately 1.3 g-moles per kilogram of polymer (mpk).
      <br/>
      The temperature of the cooling zone is gradually reduced to cool the polymer/blowing agent mixture (gel) to the optimum foaming temperature.
      <br/>
      The optimum foaming temperature ranged from 108 (degree)  C. to 111 (degree)  C. The die temperature is maintained at 108-109 (degree)  C. throughout the tests in this example.
      <br/>
      The die opening is adjusted to achieve a good foam strand free from prefoaming.
    </p>
    <p num="176">Processability and Strength Testing</p>
    <p num="177">
      The processability data of the tests are summarized in Table 10.
      <br/>
      Good foams having low densities and substantially closed-cell structure are achieved from the polymer bends as well as from the LDPE resin.
      <br/>
      The blends permit greater die openings and thus larger is foam cross-sectional sizes.
      <br/>
      All foams have a width of approximately 32 mm.
      <br/>
      The foams are dimensionally stable during aging at a room temperature while exhibiting little shrinkage.
      <br/>
      The strength properties of the foams are tested approximately one month after extrusion.
      <br/>
      As shown in Table 10, the foams made from LDPE/ES blends are stronger and tougher than the LDPE foam in both tensile and compression tests.

    <p num="179">Damping Characteristics</p>
    <p num="180">
      The foams prepared above are tested for their damping characteristics.
      <br/>
      The test specimens are prepared from foam strands made above by cutting them into strips of approximately 12.7 mm in width, 4.5 mm in thickness and 51 mm in length.
      <br/>
      The damping tests are conducted on a dynamic mechanical spectrometer operated in a oscillatory torsional mode.
      <br/>
      In practice, a specimen is mounted on a torsional test jig so that the length between the clamps could be approximately 45 mm.
      <br/>
      At an ambient temperature of approximately 25 (degree)  C., the specimen is twisted to approximately 0.5% strain in a back-and-forth oscillatory motion at a speed of one radian per second at the start.
      <br/>
      The speed of oscillation is gradually increased until it reached 100 radians per second where the test is terminated.
      <br/>
      During the frequency scan, there are recorded the storage modulus (G'), the loss modulus (G"), tan 6 and the damping coefficient (C).
      <br/>
      The latter two properties are related to the former properties and the oscillating speed by the following equations:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="181">where,  OMEGA  is the angular speed in radians per second and f, the frequency in Hertz (Hz).</p>
    <p num="182">
      Two specimens are tested per each foam.
      <br/>
      In Table 11, the excerpted data at one Hz and 10 Hz are presented.
      <br/>
      The data are the average of values for two runs.
      <br/>
      In addition, the damping coefficients for the entire range of frequency are shown in Table 12.
      <br/>
      It is evident from the table that the LDPE/ES blend foams are superior to the LDPE foam in damping or energy-absorbing capabilities.
      <br/>
      That is, the foams have greater G', G", tan  DELTA , and C than the control LDPE foam.
      <br/>
      The enhancement of the energy-absorbing capability with the level of the ES copolymer is also evident.
      <br/>
      The 60/40: LDPE/ES blend foam is remarkable with its five fold better damping capability than the LDPE foam.

    <p num="185">Dynamic Cushioning Testing</p>
    <p num="186">
      As shown in the tests of this example, the LDPE/ES blend foams manifest their superior energy absorbing capabilities in dynamic cushioning as well.
      <br/>
      In this example, the foams made above are prepared into drop test specimens of approximately 2" (5.08 cm) cubes.
      <br/>
      Several foam strands are cut and heat-welded together to prepare the test specimens.
      <br/>
      A specimen is set on a table so that its vertical direction (of the foam strand) is aligned vertically.
      <br/>
      A weight is dropped onto the specimens from an approximately 61 cm (24") height.
      <br/>
      An accelerometer adhered on the top of the weight records the deceleration of the weight by the foam specimen.
      <br/>
      Four additional drops are made on the same specimen with one-minute Interval given between the drops.
      <br/>
      The tests are repeated with another weight with a new specimen.
      <br/>
      Weights are selected to exert a static stress ranging from approximately 1.8 kPa to 13.4 kPa. The thickness of the foam specimen before and after the drop tests are recorded.
    </p>
    <p num="187">
      The data are summarized in Table 13.
      <br/>
      In general, the LDPE/ES blend foams, are shown to be better shock mitigating materials that the LDPE foam.
      <br/>
      The blend foams give a lower minimum peak deceleration.
      <br/>
      The shock-mitigating capability of the LDPE/ES: 60/40 blend foam is especially remarkable as the foam records a low peak deceleration at a wide range of static loading.

      All foams recovered well after the drop tests as the recovery data for a heavy weight in Table 13 indicate.

    <p num="207">
      Ethylbenzene or toluene solvent was supplied to the mini-plant at 30 psig (207 kPa).
      <br/>
      The feed to the reactor was measured by a FMicro-Motion mass flow meter.
      <br/>
      A variable speed diaphragm pump controlled the feed rate.
      <br/>
      At the discharge of the solvent pump a side stream was taken to provide flush flows for the catalyst injection line (1 lb/hr (0.45 kg/hr)) and the reactor agitator (0.75 lb/hr (0.34 kg/hr)).
      <br/>
      These flows were measured by differential pressure flow meters and controlled by manual adjustment of microflow needle valves.
      <br/>
      Uninhibited styrene monomer was supplied to the mini-plant at 30 psig (207 kpa).
      <br/>
      The feed to the reactor was measured by a Micro-Motion mass flow meter.
      <br/>
      A variable speed diaphragm pump controlled the feed rate.
      <br/>
      The styrene streams was mixed with the remaining solvent stream.
      <br/>
      Ethylene was supplied to the mini-plant at 600 psig (4,137 kPa).
      <br/>
      The ethylene stream was measured by a Micro-Motion mass flow meter just prior to the Research valve controlling flow.
      <br/>
      A Brooks flow meter/controllers was used to deliver hydrogen into the ethylene stream at the outlet of the ethylene control valve.
      <br/>
      The ethylene/hydrogen mixture combines with the solvent/styrene stream at ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      The temperature of the solvent/monomer as it enters the reactor was dropped to .about.5 (degree)  C. by an exchanger with -5 (degree)  C. glycol on the jacket.
      <br/>
      This stream entered the bottom of the reactor.
      <br/>
      The three component catalyst system and its solvent flush also enter the reactor at the bottom but through a different port than the monomer stream.
      <br/>
      Preparation of the catalyst components took place in an inert atmosphere glove box.
      <br/>
      The diluted components were put in nitrogen padded cylinders and charged to the catalyst run tanks in the process area.
      <br/>
      From these run tanks the catalyst was pressured up with piston pumps and the flow was measured with Micro-Motion mass flow meters.
      <br/>
      These streams combine with each other and the catalyst flush solvent just prior to entry through a single injection line into the reactor.
    </p>
    <p num="208">
      Polymerization was stopped with the addition of catalyst kill (water mixed with solvent) into the reactor product line after the micromotion flow meter measuring the solution density.
      <br/>
      Other polymer additives can be added with the catalyst kill.
      <br/>
      A static mixer in the line provided dispersion of the catalyst kill and additives in the reactor effluent stream.
      <br/>
      This stream next entered post reactor heaters that provide additional energy for the solvent removal flash.
      <br/>
      This flash occured as the effluent exited the post reactor heater and the pressure was dropped from 475 psig (3,275 kPa) down to .about.250mm of pressure absolute at the reactor pressure control valve.
      <br/>
      This flashed polymer entered a hot oil jacketed devolatilizer.
      <br/>
      Approximately 85 percent of the volatiles were removed from the polymer in the devolatilizer.
      <br/>
      The volatiles exit the top of the devolatilizer.
      <br/>
      The stream was condensed and with a glycol jacketed exchanger, entered the suction of a vacuum pump and was discharged to a glycol jacket solvent and styrene/ethylene separation vessel.
      <br/>
      Solvent and styrene were removed from the bottom of the vessel and ethylene from the top.
      <br/>
      The ethylene stream was measured with a Micro-Motion mass flow meter and analyzed for composition.
      <br/>
      The measurement of vented ethylene plus a calculation of the dissolved gasses in the solvent/styrene stream were used to calculate the ethylene conversion.
      <br/>
      The polymer seperated in the devolatilizer was pumped out with a gear pump to a ZSK-30 devolatilizing vacuum extruder.
      <br/>
      The dry polymer exits the extruder as a single strand.
      <br/>
      This strand was cooled as it was pulled through a water bath.
      <br/>
      The excess water was blown from the strand with air and the strand was chopped into pellets with a strand chopper.

    <p num="214">LDPE/ESI resin blend foams of the present invention were made to demonstrate the effect of ESI in broadening the observed foaming temperature window versus that typically observed in making conventional LDPE foams.</p>
    <p num="215">
      The LDPE/ESI resin blend foams were made in an apparatus comprising an extruder, a mixer, a cooler, and an extrusion die in series.
      <br/>
      Resin granules of the LDPE and ESI were dry tumble blended and fed via a hopper to the extruder.
      <br/>
      The ESI resin contained a small amount of the talc.
      <br/>
      The granules were melted and blended to form a polymer melt.
      <br/>
      The polymer melt was fed to the mixer where isobutane, a blowing agent, was incorporated to form a polymer gel.
      <br/>
      The polymer gel was conveyed through the cooler to lower the temperature of the gel to a desirable foaming temperature.
      <br/>
      The cooled polymer gel is conveyed through the extrusion die into a zone of lower pressure to form the expanded foam product.
    </p>
    <p num="216">
      Use of LDPE/ESI resin blends afforded a significant increase of the foaming temperature window to 3-4 (degree)  C. This increase is significant since the foaming window is typically only 1 (degree)  C. for foams containing only LOPE resin.
      <br/>
      Expansion of the foaming window reduces the incidence of "freeze-off" (solidification of resin prior to exiting the extrusion die) and production scrap generation.
      <br/>
      High quality, low density closed cell foams were produced without encountering freeze-off.
    </p>
    <p num="217">
      Based upon the results, useful ESI resins include those having 30-75 weight percent total styrene content, melt index of 0.5-20, and up to 20 weight percent aPS (atactic polystyrene) and preferably less than 2 weight percent aPS.
      <br/>
      Total styrene content in the ESI resin is the weight of styrene incorporated in the ethylene/styrene interpolymer plus the weight of the free constituent aPS divided by the total weight of the ESI resin.
