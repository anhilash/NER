      <br/>
      An improved production method of aromatic carboxylic acid products of significantly improved yield and quality, the method including oxidizing alkyl aromatic substrates or their partially oxidized intermediates in a catalyst system containing a conventional catalyst and, if deemed necessary, additional components such as a transition metal or lanthanide series metal, in an acetic acid medium, with a feed gas containing both oxygen and carbon dioxide.
      <br/>
      Since carbon dioxide functions as a co-oxidant along with oxygen in the oxidation reaction, the oxidation reaction proceeds more selectively to produce the carboxylic acid product much faster under milder reaction conditions as compared to the conventional oxidation.
      <br/>
      The present invention also can be utilized as an effective purification process to produce highly pure terephthalic acid or isophthalic acid by oxidation of impurities such as 4-carboxybenzaldehyde and para-toluic acid or 3-carboxybenzaldehyde and meta-toluic acid which are contaminated in crude terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid products, respectively.

    <p num="3">
      The present invention discloses an improved process for oxidizing alkyl aromatic hydrocarbons and/or their partially oxidized intermediates to produce aromatic carboxylic acids.
      <br/>
      The process involves the liquid phase oxidation in the presence of a catalyst of cobalt-manganese-bromine in an aliphatic carboxylic acid having 1-6 carbon atoms such as acetic acid as a solvent with a gas containing oxygen and carbon dioxide.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, an additional transition metal or lanthanide series metal is introduced to the cobalt-manganese-bromine catalyst system, when deemed necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The rate of the oxidation reaction of an alkyl aromatic substrate was remarkably increased in the present process over the conventional oxidation process.
      <br/>
      The yield and quality of the carboxylic acid products were also significantly improved in the process.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid of improved yield and purity are produced by carrying out the oxidation of para-xylene and meta-xylene, respectively, in the co-presence of carbon dioxide and oxygen under relatively mild reaction conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="5">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="6">
      As discussed below, methods of manufacturing aromatic carboxylic acids are well known and widely used commercially.
      <br/>
      For example, the method of manufacturing of aromatic carboxylic acids such as terephthalic acid (TPA), isophthalic acid (IPA), phthalic acid, phthalic anhydride, naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, trimellitic acid, trimellitic anhydride, trimesic acid, pyromellitic dianhydride, 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylic acid and benzoic acid by oxidizing alkylaromatic compounds or the oxidized intermediates thereof, in the presence of cobalt-manganese-bromine, from such alkylaromatic compounds as para-xylene, para-tolualdehyde, para-toluic acid, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA), meta-xylene, meta-tolualdehyde, meta-toluic acid, 3-carboxybenzaldehyde, ortho-xylene, dimethylnaphtalene, pseudocumene (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene), mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene), durene (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene), 4,4'-dimethylbiphenyl and toluene is well known (for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,833,816 and 5,183,933).
      <br/>
      Such aromatic carboxylic acids are used as raw materials for manufacturing polyester after appropriate purification such as hydrogenation, etc. (U.S. Pat. No. 3,584,039).
      <br/>
      Also, polyester is widely used as a synthetic fiber, film, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      There were continuous endeavors to develop a catalyst system with high efficiency and enhanced reactivity to manufacture aromatic carboxylic acids.
      <br/>
      The newly developed technologies, however, were not practical due to the increase in side reactions, price of catalyst, difficulty of operation, precipitation of catalyst, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Improvements in the efficiency of the reaction for manufacturing of aromatic carboxylic acids are very significant because they may improve productivity, quality and cost competitiveness due to the reduction in the reaction time and side reactions.
      <br/>
      In other words, it is highly desirable to develop a technology to increase the efficiency of the oxidation reaction of alkyl aromatic compounds and the oxidized intermediates thereof by means of an improvement in the reaction processes.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      There were many attempts to increase the efficiency by adding a third metal catalyst to the cobalt-manganese-bromine catalyst system which is the basic catalyst system, to enhance the catalyst efficiency during the manufacturing of aromatic carboxylic acids.
      <br/>
      The added metals were mainly transition metals, and by adding, for example, hafnium, zirconium, molybdenum, etc., the reactivity therein was increased (U.S. Pat. No. 5,112,992).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      On the other hand, an oxygen containing gas such as air was mainly used as an oxidant during the manufacturing of aromatic carboxylic acids.
      <br/>
      Carbon dioxide was not used as an oxidant due to its chemical stability.
      <br/>
      Yet, in the research for improving the process efficiency, there was a case in which chemically stable carbon dioxide, recycled from the reaction vent gas, was injected to the reactor to increase the stability in the process by mitigating the problematic possibilities of explosion due to oxygen when using pure oxygen or gas containing pure oxygen or oxygen enriched gas as an oxidant (U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,856).
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the case is not known in which carbon dioxide was added to improve the reaction efficiency and the effects of the concentration of added carbon dioxide on oxidation.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In summary, the basic oxidation technology for manufacturing carboxylic acids, especially for TPA manufacture, has been extensively developed.
      <br/>
      The basic process technology is now approaching a point of diminishing returns, and further major breakthroughs i.e., new catalyst systems, raw materials, and basic unit operations, are not anticipated.
      <br/>
      The leading producers are expected to have greater optimization and energy integration across the entire production complex with more advanced control schemes.
      <br/>
      However, surpassing the current general expectation, the present invention have made a remarkable breakthrough to achieve the improved catalyst activity and selectivity toward aromatic carboxylic acids, especially for terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid, in the aforementioned catalyst composition under milder oxidation conditions.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      As a result of research for resolving the above problems, the inventors herein added an appropriate amount of carbon dioxide to the oxygen containing gas, which was supplied as an oxidant in the oxidation reaction, in the manufacturing of aromatic carboxylic acids in the catalyst of cobalt-manganese-bromine, in which a transition metal or lanthanide metal was added as deemed necessary.

    <p num="20">
      The present invention relates to a production method of aromatic carboxylic acids, wherein alkylaromatic compounds or the oxidized intermediates thereof are oxidized by an oxygen containing gas, with an aliphatic carboxylic acid having 1-6 carbon atoms as a solvent, in the presence of a catalyst of cobalt-manganese-bromine, with addition of a transition metal or lanthanide metal as deemed necessary.
      <br/>
      In the process, an appropriate amount of carbon dioxide is added to the oxygen containing gas, which is supplied as an oxidant.

      In the basic catalyst, the atomic weight ratio of manganese/cobalt is preferably 0.1.about.10, or more preferably 0.5.about.5. The atomic weight ratio of bromine/(manganese+cobalt) is preferably 0.1.about.10, or more preferably 0.5.about.2. The concentration of cobalt is preferably 20.about.10,000 ppm of the weight of the reactants (i.e., the substrate (the starting substance to be oxidized such as the alkylaromatic compound), the solvent, and the catalyst), or more preferably 50.about.10,000 ppm.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      As for the source of bromine, it could be a bromine compound, such as hydrogen bromide, tetrabromoethane, etc.
      <br/>
      As for the source of manganese and cobalt, a compound which is soluble in solvents, such as acetate, carbonate, acetate tetrahydrate, bromide, etc. can be used, or more preferably, sources of cobalt, manganese, and bromine are cobalt acetate tetrahydrate, manganese acetate tetrahydrate, and hydrogen bromide, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Compounds of Ce, Zr, Hf, Mo, Cr, Fe, W, etc. are preferred for transition metals or lanthanide metals, which are added if necessary.
      <br/>
      The weight ratio of the added transition metal or lanthanide metal/manganese is preferably 0.001.about.1. Further, the present invention can be applied to an oxidation reaction by a cobalt-manganese catalyst without bromine as well as to the oxidation reaction by a nickel-manganese-bromine catalyst.

    <p num="26">
      The solvent used in the present invention can be any aliphatic acids of C1.about.C6, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, n-butyric acid, isobutyric acid, pentanoic acid, hexanoic acid, trimethylacetic acid, etc, or more preferably acetic acid or the mixture of acetic acid and water.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the solvent comprises from 2% to 25%, by weight, of water.
      <br/>
      The amount of solvent should be 1.about.10 times the weight of an alkylaromatic compound or the oxidized intermediate compound thereof.
      <br/>
      Further, the present invention can be applied to the oxidation reaction with water as a solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      As for the reaction gas used in the present invention, oxygen, or a gas mixture of oxygen and an inert gas such as nitrogen can be used, or more preferably, a gas mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide can be used.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the reaction gas or feed gas lacks an inert diluent.
      <br/>
      The minimal pressure of the reaction is such that some portions of an alkylaromatic compound or the oxidized intermediate thereof and the solvent are maintained as liquid.
      <br/>
      The reaction pressure is appropriately 0.about.35 atm in terms of the gauge pressure or more preferably 8.about.30 atm.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The amount of carbon dioxide should be 1.about.80% by volume of the gas, or more preferably 5-50% by volume.
      <br/>
      As for the method of adding carbon dioxide, it can be supplied in the gas phase at the upper part of the reactor or in the reactants of liquid phase, either periodically or continuously. (For example, carbon dioxide may be added with a gas sparging device into one or more zones of a reactor in a gas phase or liquid phase either periodically, intermittently, or in a continuous manner.) As for the method of supplying carbon dioxide to the reactor, carbon dioxide can be mixed into the reaction gas.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the method of recycling the reacted vent gas to the reaction gas can be used for the purpose of utilization of the carbon dioxide and oxygen remaining in the vent gas. (For example, carbon dioxide remaining in the reaction vent gas may be recovered by condensation and recycled to provide carbon dioxide required for the oxidation reaction).
      <br/>
      When it is supplied to the reactants in liquid, a dip tube, etc. can be used for supplying via bubbling or sparging.

    <p num="29">
      The production method of aromatic carboxylic acids of the present invention could be carried out by a batch type process or a continuous process.
      <br/>
      The appropriate reaction temperature should be 100.about.255 (degree)  C., or more preferably 175.about.235 (degree)  C., or most preferably 180.about.210 (degree)  C. If the reaction temperature is too low, it is impractical since the reaction rate is too slow.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the reaction temperature is too high, it is non-economical due to the excessive side reactions.
    </p>
    <p num="30">As a reactor, general CSTR (continuous stirred tank reactor) or LOR (liquid oxygen reactor) specially designed to mix liquid oxygen and liquid hydrocarbon substrates without appreciable loss of unreacted oxygen into the overhead vapor space can be used.</p>

      According to the present invention, the reaction time is decreased at the same reaction temperature for obtaining the same conversion.
      <br/>
      At the same reaction time, the present invention requires a lower reaction temperature for a given conversion.
      <br/>
      The productivity and quality such as chemical impurities can be improved due to the decreased side reactions with the present invention.

    <p num="32">
      The present invention is explained in detail by examples below.

      Based on the total weight of reactants (also referred to as the reaction mixture), the catalyst was comprised of 100 ppm of cobalt, 200 ppm of manganese, and 300 ppm of bromine.

      Cobalt acetate tetrahydrate, manganese acetate tetrahydrate and hydrogen bromide were used for the catalyst.
      <br/>
      At the reaction temperature of 195 (degree)  C., nitrogen was added up to 12.9 atm, and then carbon dioxide was added up to 16.8 atm, and then oxygen was instantaneously added to 28.0 atm so that the concentrations of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen in the gas phase became 46, 14, and 40% by volume, respectively.
      <br/>
      When the reaction pressure reached 28 atm, the amount of consumed oxygen was measured with time, and the oxygen was continuously fed to maintain the same pressure (28 atm) to compensate for the amount of oxygen consumed in the oxidation reaction.

    <p num="76">In summary, the present invention discloses an improved process for the production of aromatic carboxylic acids, wherein alkyl aromatic compounds or their partially oxidized intermediates are oxidized with a catalyst system, Co--Mn--Br, in the acetic acid medium, with an oxygen feed gas containing a substantial amount of carbon dioxide. (Of course, the aromatic carboxylic acids made by the present invention may be used to make polyester or other products.) This process can also be used to purify crude aromatic carboxylic acid products containing as impurities partially oxidized intermediates of alkyl aromatic compounds to obtain substantially pure aromatic carboxylic acids.</p>
    <p num="77">
      The oxidation reaction of alkylaromatic substrates proceeds more selectively with a much faster rate to produce aromatic carboxylic acid products of improved quality, than the conventional oxidation process.
      <br/>
      The oxidation reaction occurs under conditions milder than that of the conventional process, and produces aromatic carboxylic acid products of higher purity (containing less impurities such as partially oxidized intermediate oxygenates) in higher yield.
      <br/>
      In other words, the yield and quality of the aromatic carboxylic acid product such as isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid were improved significantly beyond the current general expectations of the world-wide IPA and PTA (purified terephthalic acid) producers by means of conducting the oxidation reaction with a mixed feed gas containing oxygen and a substantial amount of carbon dioxide in an acetic acid medium under relatively mild conditions.
      <br/>
      Another catalyst system, in which the cobalt-manganese-bromine system containing an additional transition metal or lanthanide series metal, is also revealed in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      In conclusion, the present invention discloses for the first time that carbon dioxide functioned as a co-oxidant along with oxygen in the oxidation process of alkylaromatics such as para-xylene.
      <br/>
      In particular, it was found that in the present invention (a) CO2 is capable of modulating the oxidative property of O2 over the Co--Mn--Br catalyst, (b) the oxidation rate was increased (i.e., enhanced catalytic activity), (c) the oxidation became more selective toward the desired product (i.e., increased selectivity), (d) the reaction product distribution was dramatically altered (i.e., purer production formation), (e) much lower amounts of the partially oxidized products were found in the final acid product (thus, the present invention can be used for a purification process of crude terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid), (f) under identical reaction conditions (as compared to the conventional MC-type process), the reaction temperature required to obtain the same level of the conversion (activity) becomes much lower (in other words, the same product yield can be obtained at much lower temperatures, or the product yield can be much higher at the same temperature, and thus a much smaller reactor is required, resulting in an economically more attractive process), (g) a higher concentration of O2 can be used in the reactor without causing an explosion or burning (i.e., safer operation is feasible), and (h) less burning occurs, promoting higher selectivity toward the desired main product, TPA.
      <br/>
      These findings are believed to be attributed to the generation of a very active oxygen species for the oxidation reaction (the oxygen species being more active than that provided by molecular dioxygen (O2 )) created from an intermediate complex of peroxocarbonate form in the co-presence of CO2 and O2 over an MC-type catalyst (cobalt-manganese-bromine), the peroxocarbonate being believed to be of the following form:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
