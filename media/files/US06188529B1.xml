      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a projecting apparatus suitable for, e.g., a color liquid crystal projector for enlarging and projecting image information displayed on one or a plurality of optical modulation elements such as liquid crystal panels on a screen or the like.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      A variety of color liquid crystal projectors for projecting image information displayed on a liquid crystal panel as an optical modulation element on a screen are conventionally proposed.
      <br/>
      An optical system for a liquid crystal projector using a transmission liquid crystal is proposed, i.e., Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 61-99118. FIG. 1 is a view schematically showing the optical system of this prior art.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Referring to FIG. 1, light emitted by a light source 1 is roughly collimated by a reflector 2 (parabolic mirror) and incident on a dichroic mirror 34 which transmits the blue light component (B light component) and reflects the green light component (G light component) and the red light component (R light component).
      <br/>
      The C and R light components reflected by the dichroic mirror 34 enter a dichroic mirror 35 which reflects the green light component (G light component) and transmits the red light component (R light component).
      <br/>
      The green light component reflected by the dichroic mirror 35 illuminates a liquid crystal panel 14 for G light, and the red light component transmitted through the dichroic mirror 35 illuminates a liquid crystal panel 15 for R light.
      <br/>
      The blue light component transmitted through the dichroic mirror 34 illuminates a liquid crystal panel 16 for B light.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The light beams transmitted through the liquid crystal panels 14, 15, and 16 are modulated in accordance with image information in units of colors.
      <br/>
      The light beams from the liquid crystal panels 14 and 16 are synthesized by a dichroic mirror 37 which transmits a blue light component and reflects a green light component.
      <br/>
      The red light component from the liquid crystal panel 15 passes through a mirror 38 and reaches a dichroic mirror 39 which transmits a red light component and reflects blue and green light components.

      When the white level is to be displayed, the liquid crystal panel becomes transparent to reflect an incoming light beam.
      <br/>
      In displaying the black level, it scatters the light beam.
      <br/>
      The light components reflected by the liquid crystal panels and synthesized by the cross dichroic prism 42 are focused near the stop 28 of the projecting lens 48 through the plano-convex lens 44.
      <br/>
      Most light components reflected by the liquid crystal panels pass through the aperture of the stop 28 to display the white level on the screen 23 through the projecting lens 48.

    <p num="23">The conventional color liquid crystal projectors shown in FIGS. 1 to 5 have the following problems.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The optical system shown in FIG. 1 cannot achieve color separation and synthesis without four dichroic mirrors (34, 35, 37, and 38) which are hard to manufacture.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the flat dichroic mirrors 39 and 37 must be arranged tilted between the projecting lens 48 and the liquid crystal panels 15 and 16, respectively.
      <br/>
      Astigmatism generated by the dichroic mirrors 37 and 39 degrades the projected image.
      <br/>
      If the resolution of the liquid crystal panel is low, the astigmatism can be ignored, but it is a problem in a high-resolution liquid crystal projector.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The color liquid crystal projector shown in FIG. 2 solves the above problem of astigmatism.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, the cross dichroic prism 42 is used in the color synthesis optical system, thereby preventing astigmatism.
      <br/>
      However, the cross dichroic prism 42 is more difficult to manufacture than the flat dichroic mirrors used in the color synthesis optical system shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      This is because the prism vertical angle process accuracy, prism joint accuracy, prism refractive index, and the like must be strictly managed to prevent the projected image from being discontinuous at the four prism joint portions.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      To obtain desired characteristics, the dichroic mirror film must have a multilayered structure having a larger number of layers than that of the flat dichroic mirror.
      <br/>
      This also results in difficulty in manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In the color projectors shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the color synthesis optical system has no cross dichroic prism.
      <br/>
      In the optical system shown in FIG. 3, however, the liquid crystal panel 15 and the field lens 46 are decentered from each other by the distance s, and so are the liquid crystal panel 16 and the field lens 47.
      <br/>
      For this reason, distortion due to this decentering poses a problem.
      <br/>
      The distortion makes it difficult to match the pixels of the three liquid crystal panels on the entire image.
      <br/>
      For this reason, this optical system is not fitted for application to a high-resolution liquid crystal projector used as, e.g., a computer monitor.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In the optical system shown in FIG. 4, the liquid crystal panels are arranged in the focused light beam.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the incident angle of illumination light changes depending on the position of the liquid crystal panel, resulting in contrast variations or color variations in the projected image.
      <br/>
      In addition, as no field lens is inserted between each liquid crystal panel and the projecting lens 48, distortion and curvature of field of the projecting lens are hard to correct.
      <br/>
      For this reason, again this optical system is not fitted for application to a high-resolution liquid crystal projector used as, e.g., a computer monitor.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In the color liquid crystal projector shown in FIG. 5, the transparent type liquid crystal in FIG. 2 is replaced with a reflection liquid crystal.
      <br/>
      The cross dichroic prism 42 is used not only as a color separation optical system but also as a color synthesis optical system, so the flat dichroic mirrors 34' and 35' can be omitted.
      <br/>
      However, this apparatus also uses the cross dichroic prism which is hard to manufacture.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Each of the color liquid crystal projectors shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 synthesizes three color light components through the entrance pupil of the projecting lens 48 and guides the synthesized light to the projecting lens 48.
      <br/>
      However, the color balance on the screen 23 depends on the arrangement of the mirrors 20 and 21.
      <br/>
      Since it is difficult to accurately arrange the mirrors 20 and 21, the color balance on the screen is unsatisfactory.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In the general projecting apparatus such as a color liquid crystal projector, the light amount distribution on the screen for the respective channels of the red light component (R light component), the green light component (G light component), and the blue light component (B light component) must be unified.
      <br/>
      However, the solid angles of the mirrors 20 and 21 subtended at given points on the liquid crystal panels 15 and 16 differ, so no uniform light amount distribution can be attained.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Also, various single plate projecting apparatuses using, as an optical modulation-element, an optical modulation element using a liquid crystal to project color image information on a predetermined surface are proposed.
      <br/>
      In the single plate color optical modulation element using an optical modulation element comprising a liquid crystal, the black matrix for shielding, from light, the interconnection of an optical modulation control portion around the pixels of the optical modulation element (liquid crystal) has a large occupied area in the optical modulation element.
      <br/>
      This lowers the light utilization efficiency of the entire apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 63 is a view schematically showing such an optical modulation device 1200 using a liquid crystal to improve the light utilization efficiency.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 63, a microlens array 1121 is arranged in front of color filers 1151R, 1151G, and 1151B to focus illumination light W from a white light source onto the B, G, and R pixels of an optical modulation element 1120.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, the light utilization efficiency of the optical modulation element 1200 is raised.
      <br/>
      This element also has a transparent substrate 1122 and a black matrix 1205 (FIG. 63).
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The optical modulation element shown in FIG. 63 uses color filters as members for extracting color light components corresponding to the pixels of each optical modulation element.
      <br/>
      However, each color filter transmits only a light component having a predetermined wavelength in white light incident on each pixel, and therefore is useless for other wavelength components, so the light utilization efficiency is very low.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="131">
      FIG. 6 is a schematic view of the first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 8 and 9 are schematic views of part of an optical system shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 is an explanatory view of part of the arrangement shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the projecting apparatus is applied to a color liquid crystal projector using a transmission liquid crystal panel (also called a "liquid crystal") as an optical modulation element.
    </p>
    <p num="132">Referring to FIG. 6, white light W emitted by a light source (light source means) 1 is reflected and roughly collimated by a reflector 2 (parabolic mirror) and separated into light beams corresponding to a plurality of wavelength ranges (e.g., a red light component (R light component), a green light component (G light component), and a blue light component (B light component): to be abbreviated as "R light component, G light component, and B light component" hereinafter) by a color separation element (color separation means) 3.</p>
    <p num="133">
      FIG. 10 is a sectional view of the color separation element of this embodiment.
      <br/>
      The color separation element of this embodiment is of transmission type and comprises an echelon diffraction grating 3-1.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 10, the incident white light W is transmitted through the diffraction grating 3-1 and separated into 0th- and  +- 1st-order diffraction light components each having its diffraction efficiency peak in a specific wavelength range in accordance with the optical path difference in the fine echelon structure which passes the white light.
      <br/>
      These light components emerge as light beams corresponding to the wavelength bands of R, G, and B light components.
    </p>
    <p num="134">A reflection diffraction grating 3-2 shown in FIG. 11 may be used in place of the transmission diffraction grating as the color separation element 3 of this embodiment.</p>
    <p num="135">
      In FIG. 11, the incident white light W is reflected by the diffraction grating and separated into 0th- and  +- 1st-order diffraction light components each having its diffraction efficiency peak in a specific wavelength range in accordance with the optical path difference in the fine echelon structure which reflects the white light.
      <br/>
      These light components are reflected as light beams corresponding to the wavelength bands of R, G, and B light components.
      <br/>
      In the reflection diffraction grating 3-2, the optical path deflects upon reflection.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 6, this diffraction grating is developed into a transmission optical system.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      FIG. 12 is a schematic view showing the color separation element of the present invention, which comprises three dichroic mirrors 3-3-B, 3-3-G, and 3-3-R.
      <br/>
      The dichroic mirror 3-3-B has spectral characteristics in which the B light component in the blue wavelength band is reflected, and G and R light components are transmitted.
      <br/>
      The dichroic mirror 3-3-G has spectral characteristics in which the G light component in the green wavelength band is reflected, and B and R light components are transmitted.
      <br/>
      The dichroic mirror 3-3-R has spectral characteristics in which the R light component in the red wavelength band is reflected, and the orange wavelength band is transmitted.
      <br/>
      The dichroic mirrors are tilted so that the reflected light is separated into R, G, and B light components.
      <br/>
      Instead of the dichroic mirror, a simple high-reflection mirror can be used as the dichroic mirror 3-3-R.
      <br/>
      In the dichroic mirrors, the optical path deflects upon reflection.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 6, these dichroic mirror are developed into a transmission optical system.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      Both the diffraction gratings 3-1 and 3-2 as color separation elements shown in FIGS. 10 and 11 and the dichroic mirrors shown in FIG. 12 have spectral characteristics representing large dependence on light incident angle.
      <br/>
      In these color separation elements, the dependence on light incident angle results in color variations or luminance variations of illumination.
    </p>
    <p num="138">In this embodiment, the color separation element is placed in the substantially collimated light beam reflected by the reflector 2 having a parabolic surface, thereby preventing color variations or luminance variations.</p>
    <p num="139">Referring back to FIG. 6, the R, G, and B light components from the color separation element 3 are incident on a condenser lens (lens means) 4 at different angles and focused through the condenser lens 4 such that light source images are formed near mirrors 5 and 6 as the first deflection means which are arranged tilted at an interval.</p>
    <p num="140">
      Of these three color light components, e.g., the G light component passes between the mirrors 5 and 6, is roughly collimated by a lens system 7, and illuminates a transmission liquid crystal panel 14.
      <br/>
      The light beam modulated by the liquid crystal panel 14 in accordance with image information is focused through a-field lens (lens) 17 such that a light source image is formed again between mirrors 20 and 21 as the second deflection means disposed near a stop 28 of a projection optical system (also called a "projecting lens") 22.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      The R light component is reflected by the mirror 5, roughly collimated by a lens system 8, and illuminates a transmission liquid crystal panel 15 through mirrors 10 and 11.
      <br/>
      The light beam modulated by a transmission liquid crystal panel 15 in accordance with image information is focused through a field lens (lens) 18 such that a light source image is formed again on the mirror 20 arranged near-the stop 28 of the projection optical system 22.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      Similarly, the B light component is reflected by the mirror 6, roughly collimated by a lens system 9, and illuminates a transmission liquid crystal panel 16 through mirrors 12 and 13.
      <br/>
      The light beam modulated by the transmission liquid crystal panel 16 in accordance with image information is focused through a field lens (lens) 19 such that a light source image is formed again on the mirror 21 arranged near the stop 28 of the projection optical system 22.
    </p>
    <p num="143">From the viewpoint of aberration correction, the field lenses 17 to 19 preferably comprise plano-convex lenses with their flat surfaces facing the liquid crystal panels 14 to 16, respectively, and more preferably, aspherical plano-convex lenses.</p>
    <p num="144">The mirrors 5 and 6 make up one element of the first deflection means, and the mirrors 20 and 21 one element of the second deflection means.</p>
    <p num="145">
      The G light component passes between the mirrors 20 and 21, and the R and B light components are reflected by the mirrors 20 and 21, respectively, and guided to the projection optical system 22.
      <br/>
      The projection optical system 22 synthesizes the pieces of image information from the liquid crystal panels 14 to 16 into a full-color image and projects it on a screen 23.
    </p>
    <p num="146">In this embodiment, the lens means 4, the first deflection means 5 and 6, and the lens systems 7 to 9 form one element of the optical means.</p>
    <p num="147">The arrangement of the field lenses 17 to 19, the liquid crystal panels 14 to 16, and the mirrors 20 and 21, and the method of illuminating each liquid crystal panel in this embodiment will be described next with reference to FIGS. 7A to 7C.</p>
    <p num="148">
      The field lenses 18 and 19 have a common optical axis (alternate long and short dashed line in FIG. 6) perpendicular to the optical axis of the field lens 17.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, each of the mirrors 20 and 21 is arranged at an angle of 45 (degree)  with respect to the common optical axis.
      <br/>
      The angle formed by the mirrors 20 and 21 is 90 (degree) . When the mirror surfaces of the mirrors 20 and 21 are extended toward the projection optical system, they cross at the intersection of the common optical axis of the field lenses 18 and 19 and the optical axis of the field lens 17.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      More specifically, when the field lens 18 and the liquid crystal panel 15 are folded back about the mirror 20, they overlap the field lens 17 and the liquid crystal panel 14.
      <br/>
      Similarly, when the field lens 19 and the liquid crystal panel 16 are folded back about the mirror 21, they overlap the field lens 17 and the liquid crystal panel 14.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      In FIG. 7A, the optical path of the field lens 18 and the liquid crystal panel 15 which are folded back about the mirror 20 and the optical path of the field lens 19 and the liquid crystal panel 16 which are folded back about the mirror 21 are indicated by solid lines, and the actual optical paths are indicated by dotted lines.
      <br/>
      Each optical path is represented by the principal ray from the liquid crystal panel.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal panels are arranged at optically equivalent positions with respect to the projection optical system 22.
      <br/>
      The light beams from the liquid crystal panels are transmitted through different portions of the stop 28 of the projection optical system 22 and synthesized into a full-color image on the screen.
      <br/>
      Note that only the rear element of the projection optical system 22 is illustrated.
    </p>
    <p num="151">To match the liquid crystal panel positions and to make the light beams pass through different portions of the stop 28 of the projection optical system 22, at least the liquid crystal panels 15 and 16 are illuminated with light beams tilted with respect to the optical axis (18a or 19a), as shown in FIG. 7A.</p>
    <p num="152">The mirrors 20 and 21 as the second deflection means are placed to divide a stop aperture 28a of the projection optical system 22 into a plurality of areas, as shown in FIG. 7B. The X-axis is set along the direction of division.</p>
    <p num="153">As shown in FIG. 7C, when the Y-axis is set along an optical axis 22a of the projection optical system 22, light beams tilted in the direction of division (X-direction) of the stop aperture 28a and illuminating the liquid crystal panels 15 and 16 mean light beams having a gradient along the direction of division (X-direction) when they are projected on the X-Y plane.</p>
    <p num="154">
      When the liquid crystal panels and the field lenses are arranged on the common optical axis, as described above, the pixels match over the entire screen with minimum distortion, thereby obtaining a high-resolution projected image.
      <br/>
      In addition, each of the images of the R, G, and B light components, which are formed through the field lenses 17, 18, and 19, respectively, has a size fit for the stop 28 of the projection optical system 22, so that the light beams can be efficiently used.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      The difference between this embodiment and the color synthesis optical system shown in FIG. 3 will be described below in detail.
      <br/>
      In the optical system shown in FIG. 3, the liquid crystal panel 15 and the field lens 46 are decentered from each other by the distance s, and so are the liquid crystal panel 16 and the field lens 47.
      <br/>
      That is, when the field lens 46 and the liquid crystal panel 15 are folded back about the mirror 20, the field lens 46 does not overlap the field lens 45.
      <br/>
      This also applies to the field lens 47.
      <br/>
      Distortion due to this decentering is a problem in a high-resolution liquid crystal projector.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      In this embodiment, each liquid crystal panel and the corresponding field lens are set on the common axis, as described above.
      <br/>
      To pass the respective color light components through the stop at different portions, the illumination light beams are sent to become incident on the panel at an angle instead of decentering the liquid crystal panel and the field lens, unlike the prior art.
    </p>
    <p num="157">Since distortion can be minimized, and the pixels can be matched over the whole image, this embodiment is suitable for a high-resolution liquid crystal projector as, e.g., a computer monitor.</p>
    <p num="158">
      In the optical system shown in FIG. 4, as the liquid crystal panels are placed in focused light beams, the incident angle of illumination light changes depending on the position of the liquid crystal panel, resulting in contrast variations or color variations.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, however, an approximately collimated light beam is incident on each liquid crystal panel, so the above problem is not posed.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      In the optical system shown in FIG. 4, as no field lens is inserted between each liquid crystal panel and the projecting lens 48, the curvature of field and distortion of the projecting optical system are hard to correct.
      <br/>
      The curvature of field at this time will be described next with reference to FIG. 8.
    </p>
    <p num="160">In the projection optical system 22 of this embodiment, to accommodate the mirrors 20 and 21, the stop 28 must be set behind the projection optical system 22, and the projection optical system 22 is preferably of a retrofocus type.</p>
    <p num="161">
      In the projecting lens 48 shown in FIG. 4, likewise, the stop must be set behind the projecting lens 48 to arrange the mirrors 20 and 21.
      <br/>
      The projection optical system 22 is assumed to be a retrofocus type system having a concave lens group 32 and a convex lens group 33, as shown in FIG. 8.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      To obtain a compact and wide-angled projection optical system 22, the negative power of the first group, i.e., the concave lens group 32 must be increased.
      <br/>
      To reduce astigmatism to minimize curvature of field, the Petzval sum is preferably a small positive value.
      <br/>
      However, this condition is hard to satisfy if no field lens is inserted between the projection optical system and each liquid crystal panel, as in the prior art, so high optical performance and a compact and wide-angled projection optical system cannot be simultaneously realized.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      In this embodiment, as the field lens 17 (plano-convex lens) is arranged between the projection optical system 22 and the liquid crystal panel 14, the Petzval sum can be easily kept at a small positive value due to the positive power of the convex lens group 33 and the field lens 17.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a high resolution can be attained while realizing a compact and wide-angled projection optical system.

      Distortion will be described next with reference to FIG. 9.

      Considering the off-axis light components, the distances between the image plane and the refraction planes a and b are different because of the image height.

      Both power  PHI 1 of the projection optical system 22 and power  PHI 2 of the field lens 17 are positive power.
      <br/>
      Synthesized power  PHI  is given by:
      <br/>
      PHI = PHI 1+ PHI 2-d *  PHI 1 *  PHI 2  �1�

    <p num="167">
      Consider the light beam for each image height.
      <br/>
      As the image height of the field lens 17 increases, the distance d between lenses increases relative to the image height ( DELTA  as the difference between the points a and b).
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      According to equation �1�, the synthesized power  PHI  decreases as the image height increases.
      <br/>
      The distortion of a normal convex lens of, e.g., the projection optical system 22 has a barrel shape (or a pincushion shape when projection of the liquid crystal panel on the screen is taken into consideration), i.e., the power is large at the peripheral portion of the liquid crystal panel 14 with a large image height.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      The field lens 17 arranged between the projection optical system 22 and the liquid crystal panel, as in this embodiment, functions to reduce the power at the peripheral portion where the image height increases, i.e., relax the barrel-shaped distortion, or conversely, the pincushion-shaped distortion considering projection of the liquid crystal panel on the screen.
      <br/>
      This apparatus is suitable for a liquid crystal projector used as, e.g., a computer monitor. which must be exempt of distortion as compared to a TV monitor.
    </p>
    <p num="170">In this embodiment, an aspherical piano-convex lens having small power at the peripheral portion is employed as a field lens, thereby obtaining the same effect as described above.</p>
    <p num="171">
      To the contrary, in the convention al optical system shown in FIG. 4b no field lens is arranged between a projecting lens 48 and each liquid crystal panel, so the distortion having a barrel shape (or a pincushion shape when projection of the liquid crystal panel on the screen is taken into consideration) is hard to correct.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the optical system shown in FIG. 4 is not preferable for a liquid crystal projector as, e.g., a computer monitor.

      This is because the green light component has the largest amount of light from the light source and the highest luminous efficiency and therefore greatly contributes to the resolution.

In FIG. 19, the lines of the grating are parallel to a plane defined by the 0th-order diffraction light incident surface/reflection surface.

      To match the liquid crystal panel positions, and make the light beams pass through different portions of the stop 28 of the projection optical system 22, at least the liquid crystal panels 26 and 27 are illuminated with light beams tilted with respect to the optical axis in the X-Y plane, as shown in FIG. 21.

      To form a Schlieren optical system using reflection liquid crystal panels, the liquid crystal panels are illuminated with light beams tilted with respect to the optical axes in the Z-X plane, as shown in FIG. 15. In addition, when the liquid crystal panels and field lenses are arranged on the common optical axis, as described above, the pixels match over the entire screen with minimum distortion, thereby obtaining a high-resolution projected image.

      Each of the images of the R, G, and B light components, which are formed through the field lenses 17, 18, and 19, respectively, has a size fit for the stop 28 of the projection optical system, so that the light beams can be efficiently used.

When the diffraction angle is small, a diffraction angle  THETA  +- 1 of the 1st-order diffraction light with respect to the 0th-order diffraction light is approximately represented by:
      <br/>
      sin THETA  +- 1 = LAMBDA  +- 1 /P  �2'�

      White light emitted by a light source 1 is roughly collimated by a reflector 2 (parabolic mirror) and separated into light components corresponding to R, G, and G wavelength bands by the three dichroic mirrors.

      The dichroic mirrors 3-3'-R, 3-3'-G, and 3-3'-B are inserted in the nearly collimated light from the reflector to prevent color variations or luminance variation of illumination.

      FIG. 25 is a sectional view from the direction of an arrow in FIG. 24. The dichroic mirror 3-3'-B has spectral characteristics in which the light component in the blue wavelength band is reflected, and green and red light components are transmitted.

      The dichroic mirror 3-3'-G has spectral characteristics in which the light component in the green wavelength band is reflected, and blue and red light components are transmitted.

      The dichroic mirror 3-3'-R has spectral characteristics in which the light component in the red wavelength band is reflected, and the orange wavelength band is transmitted.

      The dichroic mirrors are tilted so that the reflected light is separated into light components in the R, G, and B wavelengths.
      <br/>
      A simple high-reflection mirror can be used in place of the dichroic mirror 3-3'-R.

      In FIG. 24, the direction of separation of the color light components is perpendicular to a plane defined by a surface on and by which the G light component is incident and reflected, as shown in FIG. 25. In a combination of a reflection liquid crystal panel and three dichroic mirrors, when the dichroic mirrors are arranged as in this embodiment, the light source unit 1, the reflector 2, and the projection optical system 22, which occupy a large area in the optical system, can be arranged on the same plane, as shown in FIG. 22, so the projector apparatus can be made compact.
      <br/>
      However, when the color light component separation direction and the reflected light deflection direction are in the same plane, as shown in FIG. 12, the same effect as described above can hardly be obtained.

      The three dichroic mirrors may be arranged as shown in FIG. 26. In this case, the dichroic mirror 3-3'-G can have wedge filter spectral characteristics in which the light beam in the green wavelength band is reflected, and orange and red light components are transmitted.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, bandpass filter characteristics in which the light component in the green wavelength band is reflected, and the blue and red light components are transmitted are not required.

      The transmittance of the bandpass filter is approximately 90% at most.

      For this reason, when the dichroic mirrors are placed as shown in FIG. 25, the light beam from the dichroic mirror 3-3'-R traverses the dichroic mirror 3-3'-G twice, so the attenuation cannot be ignored.

    <p num="269">When the liquid crystal panels and field lenses are arranged on the common optical axis, as described above, the pixels match over the entire screen with minimum distortion, thereby obtaining a high-resolution projected image.</p>
    <p num="270">In addition, the color separation optical system and the color synthesis optical system are constituted such that the green light component passes through the central portion of the stop 28 of the projection optical system, and the blue and red light components the peripheral portion of the stop, thereby obtaining a projected image having a high resolution.</p>
    <p num="271">
      The mirror arrangement of the illumination optical system of this embodiment is characterized in that each field lens and the corresponding liquid crystal panel are not perpendicular to each other, and each mirror for guiding the light beam to the corresponding liquid crystal panel is three-dimensionally arranged.
      <br/>
      A plane including a normal to the mirror is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the liquid crystal panel.
      <br/>
      As compared to the optical arrangement of the fourth embodiment, this arrangement can reduce a distance D from the rear element of the projection optical system to the stop 28 of the projection optical system.
      <br/>
      When each field lens and the corresponding liquid crystal panel are not perpendicular to each other, the number of mirrors can be decreased relative to the fourth embodiment.

    <p num="272">
      Normally, when reflection liquid crystal panels are combined with the optical system of the present invention, a reflection mirror must be arranged near the stop of the projection optical system.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the stop of the projection optical system must be set distantly behind the lens, and the projection optical system must be of a retrofocus type.
      <br/>
      When the distance D from the mirror is increased, the degree of retrofocus of the projection optical system increases.
      <br/>
      The number of lenses increases or the necessity for use of a number of special lenses such as aspherical lenses arises, resulting in an expensive projection optical system.
    </p>
    <p num="273">
      With the mirror arrangement of this embodiment, one mirror suffices.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the distance D can be made small to allow the use of a simple projection optical system.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the number of mirrors is reduced, the arrangement can be further simplified.
    </p>
    <p num="274">
      Since the mirrors in this embodiment are high-reflection Al (aluminum) mirrors optimized for the wavelength bands to be used, as in the third embodiment, the light utilization efficiency is improved, and a bright image can be obtained on the screen.

      Each of the high-reflection mirrors 24', 5', and 6' for guiding the light beams from the color separation element to the corresponding liquid crystal panels has a small size.
      <br/>
      Each of the high-reflection mirrors 20' and 21' for synthesizing the light beams from the liquid crystal panels also has a small size.

    <p num="275">A liquid crystal panel suitable for this embodiment is, e.g., a polymer dispersed liquid crystal panel, as in the third embodiment.</p>

    <p num="277">
      According to this embodiment, an incoming light beam is never transmitted through a tilted flat type dichroic mirror, unlike the prior art.
      <br/>
      Therefore, no astigmatism is generated, and an image having a satisfactory resolution can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In addition, with the compact mirror arrangement, the projection optical system can be simplified.
    </p>
    <p num="278">
      This embodiment is suitable for a liquid crystal projector used as, e.g., a high-resolution computer monitor free from distortion because each field lens need not be decentered from the corresponding liquid crystal panel in the color separation illumination system of the color synthesis optical system.
      <br/>
      In addition, in this embodiment, a field lens is inserted between each liquid crystal panel and the projection optical system to reduce distortion and curvature of field while realizing a compact and wide-angled projection optical system 22.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the compact mirror arrangement enables the use of a simple projection optical system.
      <br/>
      The projection optical system is further simplified because the number of mirrors decreases.

      In FIG. 33, when an angle A subtended at the lower edge of the liquid crystal panel 114 in the drawing by the image synthesis mirror 116 is compared with an angle B subtended at the upper edge by the mirror 116, the angle B subtended at the upper edge by the mirror 116 is smaller than the angle A subtended at the lower edge.

      For this reason, the upper-side image of the liquid crystal panel 114 in the drawing is projected as a darker image on the screen than the lower-side image of the liquid crystal panel 114.

      <br/>
      Consequently, the amount of the G light component decreases while the amounts of the B and R light components increase, so satisfactory white balance can be obtained for the image synthesized on the screen 219 as a whole.

      The reason why the reflection mirrors 216 and 217 are moved in the direction of 45 (degree)  with respect to the optical axis 238 of the projection optical system 22 is that the images of the reflection image modulation elements 214 and 215, which are projected on the screen 219, can be prevented from being blurred only when the mirrors are moved in this direction.

      The transmission diffraction grating transmits and diffracts incident light and separates it into light components mainly in three directions, as disclosed in Applied Optics, Vol. 17, No. 15, pp. 2,273-2,279 (1978. 8. 1.) Let the blazed wavelength of the transmission diffraction grating be  LAMBDA 0.
      <br/>
      Then a grating thickness dT necessary for the blazed wavelength  LAMBDA 0 is given by:
      <br/>
      dT=m *  LAMBDA 0/(n-1)

    <p num="357">
      where n is the refraction index of the medium of the diffraction grating, and m is an integer.
      <br/>
      When m=2,  LAMBDA 0=530 nm, and the refraction index n is about 1.5, the grating thickness dT of the transmission diffraction grating must be 2,120 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="358">For the reflection one-dimensional binary diffraction grating (the light incident angle on the optical axis is 45 (degree) ), a grating thickness dR must be 749.5 nm. As is apparent from this fact, the grating thickness dT of the transmission diffraction grating requires a step three-time deeper than that of the grating thickness dR of the reflection diffraction grating.</p>
    <p num="359">Generally, the reflection diffraction grating is advantageous for size reduction of the entire apparatus from the viewpoint of the space efficiency in the apparatus.</p>

      In FIG. 57, a microlens array 1121 serving as a condenser lens for focusing incident light comprises a plurality of microlenses.

      In FIG. 57, suffixes R (red), G (green), and B represent the wavelength ranges of the light components incident/emerging on/from the respective optical modulation elements.

      Referring to FIG. 57, one arbitrary microlens is represented by A; one pixel constituting the control target portion 1120 of the optical modulation element 1102 including the optical axis (the central line of the focused light beam) of the microlens A, TG; and pixels adjacent to the pixel TG, TR and TB.
      <br/>
      The R, G, and B light components incident on the microlens A arranged on the incident side of the optical modulation element 1102 at different angles are focused in the corresponding pixels TR, TG, and TB through the microlens A, subjected to optical modulation, and emerge from the optical modulation element 1102 as light beams bearing image information.
    </p>
    <p num="364">In this embodiment, since the target control portion 1120 of the optical modulation element 1102 uses a polymer dispersed liquid crystal and is combined with a Schlieren optical arrangement, the image information of the R, G, and B light components depend on the degree of diffusion of light beams.</p>
    <p num="365">
      When the stop 1115 having an aperture on the optical axis is used, as shown in FIG. 54, a light beam whose degree of diffusion is low passes through the stop 1115 of the projection optical system 1114 to reach the projection screen 1116 while a light beam whose degree of diffusion is high is shielded by the stop 1115 and cannot reach the projection screen 1116.
      <br/>
      More specifically, when the dispersion properties of the light beam are changed by the optical modulation element 1102, the number of light beams reaching the projection screen 1116 can be changed, so a halftone image can be displayed.
    </p>
    <p num="366">The principle of optical modulation of a polymer dispersed liquid crystal is generally known, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="367">With the above arrangement, white light from the light source 1111 is separated into three color light components by the one-dimensional binary diffraction grating 1101 without causing eclipse of effective light beams on the side surface of the step portion, and efficiently focused on the pixels TB, TG, and TR of the optical modulation element 1102 corresponding to the respective color light components through the microlens array 1121, thereby largely improving the light utilization efficiency.</p>

      Simultaneously, the plane (X-Z plane) defined by the optical axis of the white light (W) incident on the reflection diffraction grating and the optical axis of the 0th-order diffraction light (G light component) emerging from the diffraction grating 1101 is set to be parallel to the grating direction of the diffraction grating.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, a constant light beam size can be maintained after RGB light separation, unlike an arrangement in which the plane (X-Z plane) defined by the optical axis of white light incident on the reflection diffraction grating and the optical axis of the 0th-order diffraction light emerging from the diffraction grating is perpendicular to the grating direction of the diffraction grating.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the optical modulation element can be uniformly illuminated.

    <p num="369">
      The grating shape is appropriately selected such that the light is separated into color light components having spectral characteristics close to those of the three primary colors of an NTSC signal used as, e.g., a TV signal.

      When these color light components are synthesized after optical modulation, an image having excellent color reproduction properties is displayed.
    </p>
    <p num="370">
      The angle of light incident on the optical modulation element can be adjusted only by the one-dimensional binary diffraction grating.

      In this embodiment, the grating thickness in one pitch of the diffraction grating is slightly changed in units of steps, and the shape of the diffraction grating is designed such that the grating width in one pitch becomes uneven.

    <p num="372">
      In this embodiment, the ratio of the grating widths L1, L2, L3, and L4 is set to be 0.9:1.3:1.3:0.9 to reduce the inner band components of the  +- 1st-order diffraction light.

      <br/>
      This embodiment is designed assuming that the G light component is 0th-order light.

      However, ideal spectral characteristics can be obtained by using other light components as 0th-order light.
    </p>
    <p num="373">
      As shown in FIG. 59, a color filter 1151 for color correction may be arranged at a position where the color light components are separated.
      <br/>
      If the spectral characteristics of the color light components separated by the diffraction grating are different from those of the image signal, the color light components are sent to color filters FR, FG, and FB of the color filter 1151 for color correction to obtain ideal color information, thereby facilitating faithful image color reproduction.
      <br/>
