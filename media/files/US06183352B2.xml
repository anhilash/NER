      A first pump collects used slurry which is employed for a CMP technique.
      <br/>
      A new slurry supply device supplies new slurry having a concentration higher than a concentration of the used slurry, to the used slurry.
      <br/>
      A sensor measures a concentration of recycled slurry produced by mixing the used slurry with the new slurry.
      <br/>
      The new slurry supply device stops supplying the new slurry, in a case where the concentration which the sensor measures is equal to or above a predetermined value.
      <br/>
      A second pump supplies recycled slurry onto a polishing stage, after the used slurry is completely recycled.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a slurry recycling apparatus and method for a chemical-mechanical polishing technique (hereinafter referred to as a CMP technique).</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">A CMP technique is employed for polishing semiconductor wafers and for obtaining planer surfaces thereof.</p>
    <p num="5">
      To polish an object (particularly, the semiconductor wafer, etc.) with the CMP technique, the object is pressed against a polishing pad, and the object and the polishing pad are rotated and moved relatively.
      <br/>
      A chemical solution, that is, slurry for polishing is supplied onto the polishing pad so as the object to be polished.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A by-product, and changes in a chemical composition and a pH of the slurry which are produced and caused during the polishing process entail a drawback that the object is not satisfactorily polished.
      <br/>
      Therefore, slurry which has optimum chemical properties such as concentration, pH, etc. needs to be supplied onto the polishing pad.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      For the above-described reasons, new slurry is always supplied onto the polishing pad, resulting in consuming a large amount of slurry.
      <br/>
      However, slurry is expensive, therefore, various techniques have been proposed for recycling used slurry.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In the technique disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Application No. H2-257627, the slurry is recycled by an apparatus having a structure shown in FIG. 5.</p>
    <p num="9">
      As shown in FIG. 5, slurry used in a polisher 101 is collected into a tank 103 via a tube 102.
      <br/>
      After silica contained in the used slurry is removed therefrom by a centrifugal separator 104 connected to the tank 103, the slurry is supplied back to the tank 103.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In order to recycle the used slurry, undiluted slurry having a high concentration is supplied into the tank 103 from an undiluted slurry tank 105, whereas water, etc., is supplied from a solvent tank 106 into the tank 103.
      <br/>
      An amount of undiluted slurry and water, etc., to be supplied is controlled based on a concentration of the slurry in the tank 103.
      <br/>
      The concentration of the slurry in the tank 103 is measured by a ultrasonic propagation speed measuring device 107.
      <br/>
      The slurry recycled within the tank 103 is supplied to the polisher 101 via a tube 109 by a pump 108.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In the technique disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Utility Model Application KOKAI Publication No. H5-49257, the used slurry is collected into a recycled fluid storage tank.
      <br/>
      In this case, a flow rate and a concentration of the used slurry are measured.
      <br/>
      Based on this measured result, an amount of coolant (a surface-active agent, a rustproof agent, a fluid addition agent, etc.) is supplied into the recycled fluid storage tank.
      <br/>
      Hence, the used slurry is recycled in the recycled fluid storage tank, and the recycled slurry is supplied therefrom to a polisher.
    </p>
    <p num="12">In the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No. H10-58314, the slurry is recycled by an apparatus having the structure shown in FIG. 6.</p>
    <p num="13">
      A semiconductor wafer is placed with force on a polishing pad 201 and is made to rotate by a carrier 203 which is mounted with a shaft 202.
      <br/>
      Slurry 204 is supplied onto the polishing pad 201 from a tube 205 and is applied to polish the semiconductor wafer so as to be caught by a catch ring 206.
      <br/>
      The used slurry caught by the catch ring 206 is collected in a manifold 208 via a tube 207.
      <br/>
      New slurry is supplied into the manifold 208 via a tube 209, chemical components for recycling is supplied via a tube 210 and nonionic water is supplied via a tube 211.
      <br/>
      The new slurry, chemical components and nonionic water are added to the used slurry in the manifold 208 so as the slurry to be recycled.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The recycled slurry heats up or cools down at a predetermined temperature by a heat switcher 212.
      <br/>
      Afterward, the recycled slurry is measured and analyzed by sensors 213 to 215.
      <br/>
      An amount of new slurry, chemical components and nonionic water to be supplied is controlled by the measured and analyzed results of the sensors 213 to 215.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Further, the recycled slurry is filtered by a filter 216 and supplied onto the polishing pad 201 via the tube 205.</p>
    <p num="16">
      In the technique disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Application KOKAI Publication No. H10-118899, the used slurry is concentrated by means of a ultrafiltration (UF) unit employing a ultrafilter.
      <br/>
      In such a case, a concentration of the concentrated slurry is measured, and if the concentration thereof is equal to or above a predetermined value, an alkali agent or an acid is added to the concentrated slurry.
      <br/>
      The used slurry which has been recycled in such a manner is once stored in a polishing agent bath and supplied to a polishing apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="17">However, the above-described techniques entail problems described below.</p>
    <p num="18">
      According to the technique disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Application KOKAI Publication No. H2-257627, there is provided a single tank (tank 103) for collecting the used slurry.
      <br/>
      Thus, while the used slurry is being recycled, more used slurry is continuously supplied into the tank 103.
      <br/>
      That is, collection of the used slurry and adjusting (recycling) the concentration of the slurry are parallelly and continuously performed.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the used slurry and the centrifuged slurry each having various concentrations exist within the tank 103.
      <br/>
      This causes a drawback that adjusting the concentration of the slurry delays and the concentration thereof is hardly stable.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In addition to the above, the slurry is supplied to the polisher 101 from the tank 103 containing the used slurry together with the recycled slurry, that is, adjusting the concentration of the slurry (recycling the slurry) and supplying the slurry are parallelly and continuously performed.
      <br/>
      Hence, the slurry which has not been satisfactorily recycled may be supplied to the polisher 101, therefore, the to-be-polished object is polished with a low degree of accuracy.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In the technique disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Utility Model Application KOKAI Publication No. H5-49257, the flow rate and the concentration of the slurry to be supplied into the recycled fluid storage tank are measured, however, the concentration of the slurry recycled in the recycled storage tank is not measured.
      <br/>
      As a result of this, the concentration of the recycled slurry is not recognized.
      <br/>
      That is, even if the concentration of the recycled slurry does not satisfy a predetermined value, the slurry concentration value is not detected.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the concentration of the slurry may become unstable.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In the technique disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Application KOKAI Publication No. H10-58314, each amount of new slurry, chemical components and nonionic water to be supplied into the manifold 208 is adjusted on the basis of the chemical properties and the concentration of the already-recycled slurry.
      <br/>
      However, the concentration of the slurry to be collected into the manifold 208 from the catch ring 206 is not constant, so that the concentration and the chemical properties of the to-be-recycled slurry are not stable.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the to-be-polished object may not be preferably polished.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In the technique disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Application KOKAI Publication No. H10-118899, the used slurry is concentrated by means of the ultrafiltration unit, thus, the alkali agent contained in the slurry is removed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the alkali agent needs to be added to the concentrated slurry, and it is required to arrange an apparatus for monitoring the addition amount, etc.
      <br/>
      This entails a problem that the structure of the recycling apparatus becomes comnplicated.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The recycled slurry is once collected in the polishing agent bath, and its concentration is not checked therein.
      <br/>
      The concentration of the slurry supplied to the polisher changes, without being detected.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the to-be-polished object may not preferably be polished.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="48">A slurry recycling apparatus for a CMP technique according to the first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="49">FIG. 1 is a diagram showing a structure of the slurry recycling apparatus for a CMP technique according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="50">As illustrated in FIG. 1, the slurry recycling apparatus for the CMP technique comprises a polishing table 1, a fluid bath 2, pumps 11A, 11B, filters 12A, 12B, valves 13A to 13J, tubes 14A to 14P, collection tanks 15A, 15B, a solvent supply device 16, a new slurry supply device 17, a chemical component supply device 18, mixers 19A, 19B, analyzers 20A, 20B and a controller 21.</p>
    <p num="51">The polishing table 1 is a table on which a to-be-polished object, such as a semiconductor wafer and the like, is placed.</p>
    <p num="52">The fluid bath 2 is arranged underneath the periphery of the polishing table 1 so that used slurry dripped from the polishing table 1 remains therein.</p>
    <p num="53">
      The pump 11A is connected both to the tubes 14A and 14B and draws the used slurry from the fluid bath 2 through the tube 14A.
      <br/>
      The pump 11A supplies the drawn slurry to the filter 12A through the tube 14B.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The filter 12A is connected both to the tubes 14B and 14C, and filters the used slurry which has been supplied from the pump 11A via the tube 14B, so as unnecessary components to be isolated from the used slurry.
      <br/>
      Particularly, the filter 12A isolates the unnecessary components each having a relatively large diameter, from the used slurry.
      <br/>
      The filter 12A supplies, to the tube 14C, the filtered used slurry in which the unnecessary components are not included.
    </p>
    <p num="55">The tube 14C is joined both with the tubes 14D and 14E, so that the channels along which the used slurry supplied to the tube 14C flows are divided by two.</p>
    <p num="56">The tubes 14D and 14E conduct the used slurry to the collection tanks 15A and 15B, respectively.</p>
    <p num="57">The valves 13A and 13B are arranged on the course of the tubes 14D and the 14E, respectively, and adjust a flow rate of the used slurry to be supplied to the collection tanks 15A and 15B.</p>
    <p num="58">Since the solvent supply device 16 is connected both to the collection tanks 15A and 15B via the tubes 14F and 14G, it supplies pure water thereto via the tubes 14F and 14G.</p>
    <p num="59">The valves 13C and 13D are arranged on the course of the tubes 14F and 14G, respectively, and adjust a flow rate of the pure water to be supplied to the collection tanks 15A and 15B.</p>
    <p num="60">Since the new slurry supply device 17 is connected both to the collection tanks 15A and 15B via the tubes 14H and 14I, it supplies new slurry having a higher concentration than that of the used slurry to the collection tanks 15A and 15B via the tubes 14H and 14I.</p>
    <p num="61">The valves 13E and 13F are arranged on the course of the tubes 14H and 14I, and adjust a flow rate of the new slurry to be supplied to the collection tanks 15A and 15B.</p>
    <p num="62">
      The chemical component supply device 18 is connected to the collection tanks 15A and 15B via the tubes 14J and 14K.
      <br/>
      The chemical component supply device 18 supplies a chemical component necessary to recycle the used slurry to the collection tanks 15A and 15B via the tubes 14J and 14K.
      <br/>
      Such chemical component used to recycle the used slurry is, for example, a surface-active agent, an aggregation inhibitor or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="63">The valves 13G and 13H are arranged respectively on the course of the tubes 14J and 14K, and adjust a flow rate of the chemical component to be supplied to the collection tanks 15A and 15B.</p>
    <p num="64">
      The mixers 19A and 19B are arranged inside the collection tanks 15A and 15B, respectively, so as to mix the used slurry, pure water, new slurry and chemical components all of which are supplied into the collection tanks 15A and 15B.
      <br/>
      Thus, the slurry in which chemical components are uniformly contained is recycled.
    </p>
    <p num="65">The analyzers 20A and 20B are connected to the collection tanks 15A and 15B, respectively, and analyze the slurry (recycled slurry) which has been recycled inside the collection tanks 15A and 15B by measuring the concentration thereof.</p>
    <p num="66">
      The pump 11B is joined both with the tube 14O and the tube 14L which is joined both with the tubes 14M and 14N.
      <br/>
      The pump 11B draws the recycled slurry, which has been recycled inside the collection tank 15A, through the tubes 14L and 14M and supplies the drawn slurry to the tube 14O.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the pump 11B draws the recycled slurry, which has been recycled inside the collection tank 15B, through the tubes 14L and 14N and supplies the drawn slurry to the tube 14O.
    </p>
    <p num="67">The valves 13I and 13J are arranged on the course of the tubes 14M and 14N, respectively, and adjust a flow rate of the recycled slurry to be drawn by the pump 11B from the collection tanks 15A and 15B.</p>
    <p num="68">
      The filter 12B is joined both with the tubes 14O and 14P and filters the recycled slurry which has been supplied from the pump 11B via the tube 14O, so as unnecessary components to be isolated from the recycled slurry.
      <br/>
      Particularly, the filter 12B isolates, from the recycled slurry, such unnecessary components that are not isolated by the filter 12A owing to their relatively small diameter.
      <br/>
      The filter 12B supplies, to the polish table 1 via the tube 14P, the recycled slurry which has been filtered.
    </p>
    <p num="69">The controller 21 controls the above-described operations which are processed within the slurry recycling apparatus for the CMP technique, in accordance with a program which is provided from a recording medium or which is provided from a computer via a network, etc.</p>
    <p num="70">As explained above, there are provided two sections (collection tanks 15A and 15B) in which slurry is recycled, therefore, the slurry can be continuously and stabilizingly recycled (prepared).</p>
    <p num="71">Operations of the above-described slurry recycling apparatus for the CMP technique will now be described.</p>
    <p num="72">
      FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating operations of the slurry recycling apparatus for the CMP technique.
      <br/>
      Though omitted below, it should be assumed that the controller 21 controls operations processed by each section within the slurry recycling apparatus for the CMP technique.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      First, a to-be-polished object is placed on the polishing table 1 onto which slurry is supplied so as the object to be polished.
      <br/>
      The slurry which has been used to polish the object drips into the fluid bath 2 from the polishing table 1.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The pump 11A draws the used slurry which has been dripped into the fluid bath 2, via the tube 14A, so that the drawn slurry is collected (Step 101).
      <br/>
      The pump 11A supplies the used slurry to the filter 12A via the tube 14B.
    </p>
    <p num="75">The filter 12A filters the used slurry supplied from the pump 11A so as unnecessary components each having a relatively large diameter to be isolated therefrom (Step 102).</p>
    <p num="76">
      In this case, either one of the valves 13A and 13B, for example the valve 13A, opens in order to release the used slurry without including the unnecessary components to either one of the collection tanks 15A and 15B.
      <br/>
      The used slurry whose unnecessary components have been isolated is supplied to, for example, the collection tank 15A, via the tubes 14C and 14D (Step 103).
    </p>
    <p num="77">If the collection tank 15A is filled with a predetermined amount of slurry, the valve 13A closes, whereas the valve 13B opens, so that the used slurry collected from the fluid bath 2 is supplied to the collection tank 15B.</p>
    <p num="78">In such a case where the collection tank 15A is filled with the predetermined amount of used slurry, the valves 13C, 13E and 13G open.</p>
    <p num="79">

      First, a to-be-polished object is placed on the polishing table 1 onto which slurry is supplied so as the object to be polished.

      As a result of this, the pure water, new slurry and chemical components are added to the used slurry in the tube 34C, resulting in recycling the used slurry.

      However, the chemical properties (such as its concentration and the like) of the slurry are not optimum for polishing the object.
