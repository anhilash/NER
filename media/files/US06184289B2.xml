    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a rubber-modified styrene resin composition having an excellent appearance and impact resistance.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a rubber-modified styrene resin composition which can provide a molding having a good balance between surface gloss and impact resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a styrene resin composition and a molding thereof having good toughness and excellent adhesion, transparency, and moldability.</p>
    <heading>PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Impact-resistant styrene resins are prepared by polymerizing a styrene monomer in the presence of a rubber polymer.
      <br/>
      By virtue of their excellent strength, moldability and other properties, they are extensively used as molding materials for the housing of domestic electric appliances, such as televisions, office automation equipment, packaging materials, miscellaneous goods (or sundries) and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="4">In recent years, expansion of the field of demand for the above products and, at the same time, an increasing demand for cost reduction and a trend toward a reduction in thickness have lead to a demand for improved properties, particularly, an improvement in balance between impact resistance and surface gloss.</p>
    <p num="5">
      In general, the impact resistance of the resin prepared by the above polymerization method can be improved by either increasing the amount of the rubber polymer or increasing the average particle size of the dispersed particles.
      <br/>
      Both the above methods, however, cause deteriorated surface gloss.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the surface gloss can be improved by either reducing the amount of the rubber polymer or reducing the average particle size of the dispersed particles.
      <br/>
      Both of the above methods, however, cause remarkably lowered impact resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Thus, the impact resistance and the surface gloss are mutually conflicting properties, making it difficult to obtain an impact-resistant styrene resin possessing a high impact resistance and, at the same time, an excellent surface gloss.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In order to improve the properties of these impact-resistant styrene resins, JP-B 61-50488 and JP-A 59-20334 and JP-A 60-203618 propose a method for limiting the properties of the rubber polymer used, such as the solution viscosity, microstructure, and branch structure.
      <br/>
      Further, JP-A 62-178458 and JP-A 4-100810 and the like propose the use of a rubber polymer comprising a high-molecular weight polybutadiene rubber and a low-molecular weight polybutadiene rubber.
      <br/>
      As a result of careful review of these studies, it was found that, although an improvement over the conventional methods is certainly recognized, the balance between surface gloss and impact resistance is not yet satisfactory from the practical viewpoint.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      On the other hand, JP-B 42-17492, JP-B 48-18594, and JP-B 1-33485, JP-A 63-78317 and JP-A 63-165413 propose a method wherein a styrene/butadiene block copolymer rubber having a high affinity for an aromatic vinyl resin is singly used as the rubber polymer, and JP-A 4-88006 proposes the use of a blend of a styrene/butadiene block copolymer rubber having a higher molecular weight with a styrene/butadiene block copolymer rubber having a lower molecular weight as the rubber polymer.
      <br/>
      According to these methods, the resultant resin has, in many cases, a lowered impact resistance although it has an improved gloss.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      JP-A 62-280211 and JP-A 4-209614 propose the use of a blend of a styrene/butadiene copolymer with a polybutadiene rubber as the rubber polymer.
      <br/>
      However, the proportion of polybutadiene rubber is so low that the impact resistance is not satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      JP-A 2-178312 and JP-A 3-28210 and the like propose the provision of a particle disperser, such as a line mixer, in a production line to prepare a styrene resin possessing excellent gloss and, at the same time, high impact resistance.
      <br/>
      This proposal, however, has a critical drawback in that a great deal of investment is required due to the necessity of a change in specifications of a plant or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      JP-B 5-25897 and JP-B 4-63099 propose an impact-resistant polystyrene resin composition comprising a blend of a rubber-modified polystyrene with a styrene/butadiene block copolymer.
      <br/>
      The rubber-modified polystyrene has a problem in that the rubber-modified polystyrene should be prepared by separately preparing a rubber-modified polystyrene containing a smaller-size particle rubber polymer fraction and a rubber-modified polystyrene containing a larger-size particle rubber polymer fraction and blending by means of an extruder, or by blending a rubber-modified polystyrene containing a smaller-size particle rubber polymer with a rubber-modified polystyrene containing a larger-size particle rubber polymer in a polymerizer.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A modified polystyrene containing a rubber component, such as a styrene-butadiene block copolymer, is widely used for injection molding, such as a housing of electrical apparatus, a stationery product and a toy.
      <br/>
      Unstretched or unoriented, uniaxially stretched or oriented, or biaxially stretched or oriented styrene resin films, sheets, or tubes composed mainly of a modified polystyrene containing a rubber component, such as a styrene-butadiene block copolymer, have good transparency and impact resistance and, hence, have hitherto been widely used as materials for food packaging vessels and heat shrinkable films.
      <br/>
      The modified polystyrene resin itself, however, has poor adhesion to other materials, for example, polyamides, polyesters, iron, stainless steel, and aluminum, making it necessary to use an adhesive to improve the adhesion.
      <br/>
      Further, in the case of a composition having a high rubber content, although the impact resistance can be improved, problems associated with the transparency and the toughness of the film during molding are often increased.
      <br/>
      Lowering the rubber content can improve the transparency.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, the composition is fragile and, hence, has a deteriorated moldability into a vessel.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In order to meet the demand in the market for a balance between impact resistance and surface gloss in the styrene resin mentioned above, it is necessary to provide a resin composition which is easily produced while still maintaining excellent properties.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a rubber-modified styrene resin composition having a good balance between impact resistance and surface gloss.
    </p>
    <p num="14">An object of the present invention is to provide a production process which can produce on an industrial scale a molding of a styrene resin composition having improved adhesion, transparency, and moldability while maintaining the excellent rigidity and transparency inherent in the styrene resin, and a vessel using the film, sheet, or tube.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="25">The present invention will be described in more detail.</p>
    <p num="26">
      The rubber polymer used in the present invention can be a blend of 50 to 1% by weight of an epoxy-modified block copolymer (A) with 50 to 99% by weight of a polybutadiene rubber (B), preferably a blend of 40 to 20% by weight of an epoxy-modified block copolymer (A) with 60 to 80% by weight of a polybutadiene rubber (B).
      <br/>
      When the proportion of the epoxy-modified block copolymer is larger than 50% by weight, the impact resistance is lowered, while when it is less than 1% by weight, the gloss is lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The epoxy-modified block copolymer (A) of the present invention is an epoxidized block copolymer of 20 to 60% by weight of a styrene monomer with 80 to 40% by weight of a conjugated diene, preferably an epoxidized block copolymer of 24 to 60% by weight of a styrene monomer with 76 to 40% by weight of a conjugated diene, still preferably an epoxidized block copolymer of 30 to 45% by weight of a styrene monomer with 70 to 55% by weight of a conjugated diene.
      <br/>
      When the proportion of the styrene monomer in the epoxy-modified block copolymer is less than 20% by weight, the gloss is lowered, while when it exceeds 60% by weight, the impact resistance is lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Representative examples of the conjugated diene compound which can constitute the epoxy-modified block copolymer include 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, 1,3-pentadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, piperylene, 3-butyl-1,3-octadiene, and phenyl-1,3-butadiene.
      <br/>
      Among them, 1,3-butadiene and isoprene are preferred because they are inexpensive and easily available.
      <br/>
      These conjugated dienes may be used alone or in combinations of two or more.
    </p>
    <p num="29">

      The molecule per se may have any of straight chain, branched chain and radial structures or any combination thereof.

    <p num="30">The epoxidation of the block copolymer of styrene with the conjugated diene may be carried out by reacting the block copolymer with a known epoxidizing agent.</p>

      Examples of epoxidizing agents usable in the epoxidation reaction include organic peracids, such as peracetic acid, perbenzoic acid, performic acid, and trifluoroperacetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and a combination of hydrogen peroxide with a low-molecular fatty acid.
      <br/>
      Among them, a preferred epoxidizing agent is peracetic acid which is inexpensively available by virtue of mass production on an industrial scale and, at the same time, has relatively high stability.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred is a solution of peracetic acid in a solvent such as ethyl acetate.

      The amount of the epoxidizing agent is not particuarly limited and may be suitably selected depending upon the reactivity of the epoxidizing agent, the desired degree of epoxidation, and the amount of unsaturated carbon bonds in the block copolymer used.

      However, the amount of the epoxidizing agent is preferably such that the epoxy equivalent of the finally prepared epoxy-modified block copolymer is 140 to 7,000, preferably 140 to 2700.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The epoxy equivalent is more preferably 200 to 2000.
      <br/>
      It is calculated by the equation: epoxy equivalent=1600/(concentration of oxirane oxygen of epoxy-modified block copolymer (wt %)), and represents the weight of the epoxy-modified block copolymer per 1 mol of oxirane oxygen.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The concentration of oxirane oxygen is determined by titration with a solution of hydrogen bromide in acetic acid.

      On the other hand, when the epoxy equivalent is small, the concentration of oxirane oxygen is high.
      <br/>
      If the epoxy equivalent is smaller than 140, the polymer is less likely to have elastic properties, while if it exceeds 7000, specific properties derived from the epoxidation is less likely to appear.
