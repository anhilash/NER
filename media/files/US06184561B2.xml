      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to a semiconductor pressure sensor having strain gauges provided on a diaphragm portion for detecting pressure applied thereto.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      A conventional semiconductor pressure sensor includes a sensor chip 10 shown in FIG. 1 having a thin diaphragm portion 10a indicated by a dotted line in the figure.
      <br/>
      The diaphragm portion 10a has four piezo-resistance members (strain gauges) 1a to 1d made of an impurity diffusion layer thereon, two of which are center gauges 1a, 1b arranged at the central portion thereof and the other two of which are side gauges 1c, 1d arranged at the periphery thereof.
      <br/>
      The gauges 1a to 1d are electrically connected to form a bridge circuit as shown in FIG. 2 so that an electrical signal is output from terminals OA, OB in accordance with pressure.
      <br/>
      To form this constitution, an aluminum (Al) wiring member is provided around the diaphragm portion 10a to be electrically connected to the strain gauges 1a to 1d, and the sensor output is taken out from a circuit portion not shown to which the wiring member 2 is connected.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      As shown in FIG. 3, the sensor chip 10 is fixed to a glass base 11 by anode-bonding, and the glass base 11 is adhered to an inside wall of a casing 13 made of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) or the like by silicone system adhesive 12.
      <br/>
      Silicone gel 14 is coated on the surface of the sensor chip 10.
      <br/>
      In this constitution, the casing 13 can produce thermal distortion that adversely and innegligibly affects the sensor chip 10.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as shown in FIG. 3, a plate 15 made of 42 alloy is adhered to the lower surface of the glass base 11 by silicone system adhesive 16 to reduce the adverse effect of the thermal distortion of the casing 13 to the sensor chip 10.
      <br/>
      However, it is found that the sensor output still varies as a result of thermal hysteresis.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention has been made in view of the problem described above.
      <br/>
      An object of the present invention is to reduce variations of an output value from a semiconductor pressure sensor, caused by thermal hysteresis.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      According to a first aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor pressure sensor has a stress balance film for balancing changes in stress of a plurality of resistive members, produced by a change in temperature.
      <br/>
      This is based on an analysis that variation in sensor output is caused by different changes in stress of the resistive members, which are produced by the change in temperature.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention described above, the variation of the sensor output can be reduced to approximately zero by the stress balance film for balancing the changes in stress of the resistive members.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The stress balance film may be integrally formed with a wiring member that is electrically connected to the resistive members and provided around a diaphragm portion on which the resistive members are disposed.
      <br/>
      The stress balance film may include a plurality of stress balance film portions disposed around the diaphragm portion.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      According to a second aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor pressure sensor includes a wiring member electrically connected to a plurality of resistive members, and made of a material that exhibits a yield phenomenon at a temperature higher than an operational temperature range of the pressure sensor.
      <br/>
      This is based on an analysis that the changes in stress of the resistive members are produced by thermal hysteresis characteristics of the wiring member arranged around the resistive members.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      When the wiring member is made of the material described above, the wiring member does not exhibit thermal hysteresis characteristics within the operational temperature range of the pressure sensor.
      <br/>
      As a result, the variation of the sensor output can be prevented.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="13">Herebelow, a semiconductor pressure sensor in a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, in which the same parts as those in FIGS. 1 to 3 are indicated by the same reference numerals.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to FIG. 1, in a sensor chip 100, an N type buried layer 4 is provided in a P type silicon substrate 3 having a (110) crystal orientation, and an N type epitaxial layer 5 is provided thereon.
      <br/>
      A part of the P type silicon substrate 3 is removed by etching to form a thin diaphragm portion 10a.
      <br/>
      Center gauges 1a, 1b and side gauges 1c, 1d are formed in the diaphragm portion 10a by impurity diffusion.
      <br/>
      The gauges 1a to 1d forms a bridge circuit as shown in FIG. 2 as well.
      <br/>
      A P type isolation region 6 is formed in the N type epitaxial layer 5 to electrically insulate the diaphragm portion 10a from the periphery thereof.
      <br/>
      An oxide film 7 is provided on the N type epitaxial layer 5, and an Al wiring member 2 is disposed on the oxide film 7 at the periphery of the diaphragm portion 10a.
      <br/>
      A protection film 8 made of oxide, nitride, or the like is disposed to cover the Al wiring member 2.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The center gauges 1a, 1b and the side gauges 1c, 1d are electrically connected to the wiring member 2 through contact holes formed in the oxide film 7, and the wiring member 2 is electrically connected to a circuit portion formed on the N type epitaxial layer 5 as described below.
      <br/>
      An output signal from the bridge circuit is processed in the circuit portion to be taken out as sensor output.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Al film portions 2a to 2d as stress balance films are provided as parts of the wiring member 2 to face the four corners of the diaphragm portion 10a.
      <br/>
      A distance d of each of the Al film portions 2a to 2d from the edge of the diaphragm portion 10a is approximately 80  MU m. The wiring member 2 is simplified in FIG. 4 for easily discriminating the Al film portions 2a to 2d therefrom; however, the wiring member 2 practically has a pattern shown in FIG. 6, and has a pattern disposed around the circuit portion including a constant current power supply part C1, a temperature detection bridge part C2, ESD elements C3, C4, and the like.
      <br/>
      The pattern of the wiring member 2 arranged around the circuit portion is omitted in FIG. 6.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      According to this embodiment, the Al film portions 2a to 2d reduce the variation of the sensor output caused by thermal hysteresis.
      <br/>
      This effect was experimentally confirmed using three pressure sensor samples A, B, and C .
      <br/>
      Sample A has the same constitution as that of the conventional pressure sensor shown in FIGS. 1 and 3.
      <br/>
      Sample B has the same constitution as that of the present embodiment shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.
      <br/>
      Sample C has a constitution shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      In a sensor chip 10a of sample C, the Al thin film portions 2a to 2d are disposed to overlap with the corners of the diaphragm portion 10a.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Then, variations of sensor outputs from samples A to C caused by thermal hysteresis were measured by a thermal test.
      <br/>
      In the thermal test, an output value from each sensor when ambient temperature was initially kept at a room temperature (approximately 25 (degree)  C.) and an output value from the sensor when the temperature was returned to the room temperature after raising the temperature up to 70 (degree)  C. were measured, and a difference between the two output values was calculated.
      <br/>
      The result are shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      A horizontal axis of FIG. 8 represents a distance of the wiring member 2 including the Al film portions 2a to 2d from the corners of the diaphragm portion 10a.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As shown in FIG. 8, the output value of sample A corresponding to the conventional pressure sensor changed to a minus side by the thermal test described above, and the output value of sample B shown in FIG. 7 changed to a plus side.
      <br/>
      The output value of sample C corresponding to the present embodiment hardly changed by the test.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is confirmed that the Al film portions 2a to 2d can effectively prevent the variation of the sensor output produced by the thermal test.
    </p>
    <p num="20">More specifically, when the Al film portions 2a to 2d are not formed as shown in FIG. 1 (sample A), stress  SIGMA  in direction X in FIG. 1 changes by the thermal test described above as shown in FIG. 9A, in which the upper curve indicates stress  SIGMA  when the temperature is kept at the room temperature and the lower curve indicates stress  SIGMA  when the temperature is returned to the room temperature after being raised to 70 (degree)  C. In this case, a difference in stress  DELTA  SIGMA c at the center gauges 1a, 1b and a difference in stress  DELTA  SIGMA s at the side gauges 1c, 1d satisfy a relationship of  DELTA  SIGMA c- DELTA  SIGMA s&lt;0.</p>
    <p num="21">
      On the other hand, when the Al film portions 2a to 2d are formed at the four corners of the diaphragm portion 10a as shown in FIG. 7 (sample B), stress  SIGMA  in direction X in FIG. 7 changes by the thermal test as shown in FIG. 9B, in which the upper curve indicates stress  SIGMA  when the temperature is kept at the room temperature and the lower curve indicates stress  SIGMA  when the temperature is returned to the room temperature after being raised to 70 (degree)  C. as well.
      <br/>
      In this case, the relationship between the difference in stress  DELTA  SIGMA c at the center gauges 1a, 1b and the difference in stress  DELTA  SIGMA s at the side gauges 1c, 1d changes into  DELTA  SIGMA c- DELTA  SIGMA s&gt;0.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the sensor output from sample A not having the Al film portions 2a to 2d is shifted to a plus side, while the sensor output from sample B having the Al film portions 2a to 2d are shifted to a minus side.
    </p>
    <p num="22">This phenomenon is considered as follows in connection with the hysteresis property of the Al wiring member and the Al film portions.</p>
    <p num="23">
      Al forming the wiring member 2 has an extremely small yield stress of approximately 15 MPa.
      <br/>
      Therefore, stress produced in the wiring member 2 due to a change in temperature easily exceeds the yield stress thereof, at which a yield phenomenon occurs to produce residual strain and residual stress in the wiring member 2.
      <br/>
      The residual strain and the residual stress remain even after the temperature is returned to the room temperature.
      <br/>
      This hysteresis property differently affects the center gauges 1a, 1b and the side gauges 1c, 1d, thereby producing different changes in stress of the center gauges 1a, 1b, and the side gauges 1c, 1d.
      <br/>
      The variation of the sensor output comes from this different changes in stress of the center and side gauges 1a to 1d, i.e., from the unbalance of thermal hysteresis effect between the center gauges 1a, 2b and the side gauges 1c, 1d.
      <br/>
      It is presumed that the Al film portions 2a to 2d can compensate the unbalance of the thermal hysteresis effect between the center gauges 1a, 1b and the side gauges 1c, 1d to balance the changes in stress of the center and side gauges 1ato 1d.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Based on this analysis, the positions of the Al film portions 2a to 2d are optimized around the corners of the diaphragm portion 10a.
      <br/>
      Specifically, a change in variation amount (thermal hysteresis amount) of the sensor output with respect to the distance d (see FIG. 4) of each Al film portion from each corner of the diaphragm portion 10a (diaphragm edge) was measured by the thermal test substantially in the same manner as described above.
      <br/>
      The result is shown in FIG. 10. As understood from FIG. 10, the variation amount of the sensor output is decreased as the distance d is increased.
      <br/>
      When the distance is approximately 80  MU m, the variation amount of the sensor output is approximately zero.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the distance d of the Al film portions 2a to 2d from the diaphragm portion 10a was determined, and applied to the pressure sensor (sample C) of the present embodiment.
      <br/>
      The variation amount of the sensor output from sample C is indicated in FIG. 8 in comparison with samples A, B as well as in FIG. 10.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Thus, according to this embodiment, the different changes in stress among the strain gauges 1a to 1d, i.e., the unbalance of the thermal hysteresis effect by the wiring member 2 to the strain gauges 1a to 1d are adjusted by the Al film portions 2a to 2d functioning as the stress balance films to reduce the variation amount of the sensor output.
      <br/>
      Incidentally, the results shown in FIGS. 8, 9, and 10 were obtained by the thermal test in which the temperature was returned to the room temperature from a high temperature (70 (degree)  C.); however, it is confirmed that the same effect of making the variation amount of the sensor output to approximately zero is obtained by a thermal test in which the temperature is decreased to a low temperature (-30 (degree)  C.), and then returned to the room temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Next, a method of manufacturing the semiconductor pressure sensor in the present embodiment will be explained referring to FIGS. 11A to 11F.
      <br/>
      First, a semiconductor substrate is prepared.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 11A, the semiconductor substrate is composed of the P type silicon substrate 3, the N type buried layer 4 formed in the P type silicon substrate 3, and the N type epitaxial layer 5 formed on the silicon substrate 3.
      <br/>
      Next, the P type isolation region 6 is formed in the N type epitaxial layer 5 as shown in FIG. 11B, and the oxide film 7 is formed on the N type epitaxial layer 5 as shown in FIG. 11C.
    </p>
    <p num="27">After that, the wiring member 2 and the stress balance films 2a to 2d are formed from Al as shown in FIG. 11D. After the protection film 8 is formed as shown in FIG. 11E, the P type silicon substrate 3 is etched from the back surface side, thereby forming the diaphragm portion 10a as shown in FIG. 11F. As a result, the semiconductor pressure sensor shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 is completed.</p>
    <p num="28">
      In the method described above, since the Al film portions 2a to 2d as the stress balance films are formed in the identical step with the wiring member 2, it is not necessary to perform a special step for the stress balance films.
      <br/>
      Although the stress balance films 2a to 2d are formed as parts of the wiring member 2 in this embodiment, the stress balance films 2a to 2d may be formed separately from the wiring member 2.
      <br/>
      Each shape of the stress balance films 2a to 2d is not limited to a triangle, and is changeable.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Further, when the stress balance films 2a to 2d are provided to face the four corners of the diaphragm portion 10a as in the present embodiment, a space between the wiring member 2 and the strain gauges 1a to 1d can be effectively utilized especially when the diaphragm is octagonal; however, the positions of the stress balance films 2a to 2d may be changed.
      <br/>
      For example, the stress balance films 2a to 2d may be formed more adjacently to the center gauges 1a, 1b.
      <br/>
      The stress balance films 2a to 2d may be made of other materials such as Al--Si, Ni, in addition to Al, provided that the material has a small yield stress.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The stress balance films 2a to 2d are provided to compensate the unbalance of the thermal hysteresis effect by the Al wiring member 2 among the strain gauges 1a to 1d, and the thermal hysteresis effects are peculiar to the wiring member 2 made of material having a small yield stress.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the wiring member 2 is made of material having a yield stress that is larger than a maximum stress produced in the wiring member 2 at an operational temperature range of, for instance, -30 (degree)  C. to 70 (degree)  C., the variation of the sensor output can be effectively prevented without providing the stress balance films 2a to 2d.
      <br/>
      The applicable materials for such a wiring member are, for instance, Al(4.5 wt %)--Mg(0.5 wt %)--Mn, Al(4 wt %)--Cu(0.6wt %)--Mg(0.5 wt %)--Mn, Al(4.5 wt %)--Cu(1.5 wt %)--Mg(0.6 wt %)--Mn, and Al(5.6 wt %)--Zn(2.5 wt %)--Mg(1.6 wt %)--Cu, respectively having 195 MPa, 195 MPa, 323 MPa, 505 MPa in yield stress.
    </p>
    <p num="31">Although the present invention is applied to the pressure sensor composed of the silicon substrate 3 having a (110) crystal orientation, it may be applied to a pressure sensor composed of a silicon substrate having a (100) crystal orientation.</p>
    <p num="32">While the present invention has been shown and described with reference to the foregoing preferred embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
