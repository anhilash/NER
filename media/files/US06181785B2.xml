    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Recent advances in technology have resulted in unprecedented growth and diversification in the field of communications.
      <br/>
      Communications systems, long used for transmitting voice signals between telephones, are now being implemented in a wide variety of other applications.
      <br/>
      Such applications include, for example, the transfer of information between local area networks (LANs) and the transmission of documents via facsimile.
      <br/>
      The wide variety of available communications applications has resulted in a marked increase in the use of communications systems.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Communications system use has also increased as a result of the greater number of telephone devices now available.
      <br/>
      With the advent of devices such as portable and cellular telephones, more people spend a greater amount of time in telephonic communication than in the past.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      These factors have contributed to a general increase in the use of communications systems and, in particular, to an increase in the use of communications systems for sending long distance and international transmissions.
      <br/>
      The dramatic social and economic changes which the world has undergone in the past several years have also resulted in the increased use of long distance and international communications systems.
      <br/>
      The current socioeconomic climate of the world suggests that the number of long distance and international transmissions will continue to grow at an increased rate.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Long distance and cellular customers currently must either wait for a billing statement or contact a customer representative for the billing company whose telephony services are used in order to inquire about the specific costs assessed for a call.
      <br/>
      The rates in effect may vary depending upon factors such as, for example, the time at which a call is placed, the geographic location of the calling party and the called party, activated special features, and discounts in effect.
      <br/>
      For cost conscious consumers, obtaining charges soon after a call is made (before receiving the telephone bill) aids in budgeting and planning other calls that may require charges.
      <br/>
      With the present process for calls already made, obtaining such information can be tedious and frustrating or too untimely to aid in day-to-day budgeting.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it would be advantageous to have an improved method and apparatus for obtaining post call charge information.

      The present invention provides a method and apparatus in a communications system for providing post call billing information to a caller using a data processing system within the communications system.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      With reference now to the figures and in particular with reference to FIG. 1, a diagram of a communications system 100 is depicted in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention may be implemented.
      <br/>
      Communications system 100 in FIG. 1 includes a telecommunications network 102, also called a "Telco Network".
      <br/>
      Telecommunications network 102 may be, for example, a local exchange carrier (LEC), an interexchange carrier (IEC), or a hybrid network.
      <br/>
      In the case that telecommunications network 102 is in the form of a hybrid network, such a network may include landline and/or wireless communications systems.
      <br/>
      In the case that a call involves long distance service, the IEC is the service provider for the call within telecommunications network 102.
      <br/>
      Telecommunications network 102 also includes a number of switches 104a-104c, which provides establishing and routing a call between source customer premises equipment (CPE) 106 and target CPE 108.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Switches 104a-104c interconnect transmission facilities and are employed to route traffic throughout telecommunications network 102.
      <br/>
      Transmission facilities provide communications paths 110a-110c to carry a user's voice and network control information between switches in a network.
      <br/>
      Generally, transmission facilities include a medium, such as, for example, air, copper wires, coaxial cables, or fiber optic cables, along with electronic equipment employed to amplify and/or relay signals.
      <br/>
      CPE, also called "station equipment", is generally located at a user's premises.
      <br/>
      The depicted example contains three switches and three communications paths for illustrative purposes only.
      <br/>
      Depending on the system, other numbers of switches, communications paths, and configurations thereof may be employed.
      <br/>
      The function of CPE is to transmit and receive user information and exchange control information with telecommunications network 102 to place calls and access services from telecommunications network 102.
      <br/>
      CPE may be a communications unit, such as, for example, a telephone, a computer, or a fax machine.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The process of the present invention may be implemented in a data processing system within telecommunications network 102.
      <br/>
      For example, the data processing system may be implemented as a switch or as a computer having a connection to the switch.
      <br/>
      Turning now to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram of data processing system 200 is depicted in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Data processing system 200 is an example of a data processing system in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention may be implemented.
      <br/>
      In particular, data processing system 200 in FIG. 2 contains hardware that is depicted in functional units in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Some of the functional units described below for data processing system 200 may be configured in different physical units depending on the implementation.
      <br/>
      Examples of physical implementations are described below with reference to FIGS. 3A and 3B.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In FIG. 2, data processing system 200 contains switch intelligence (SI) 202, which includes the logic for call processing and providing pre-call information in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In addition, data processing system 200 includes switch fabric 204, which contains the communications links and other switch hardware used to connect callers to the switch and to each other.
      <br/>
      Voice server (VS) 208 contains multiple independent voice channels or paths for sending messages.
      <br/>
      In the depicted example, each of the voice channels are referred to as voice ports.
      <br/>
      For example, voice server 208 may contain three voice ports identified as VP1, VP2, and VP3.
      <br/>
      Data processing system 200 also includes a DTMF detector 210 for detecting DTMF tones that may be transmitted by a user.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the implementation, voice recognition equipment may be used in place of or in addition to DTMF detector 210.
      <br/>
      Customer database (CDB) 212 is a database containing information on customers used to determine charges for calls from a source location to various target locations.
      <br/>
      Different customers may have different rates in effect based on the particular plan subscribed to by the customer.
      <br/>
      Additionally, rates also may vary depending on factors, such as, for example, the time at which a call is placed, the geographic location of the calling party and of the called party, currently activated special features, and discounts currently in effect for a particular customer.
      <br/>
      Depending on the long distance or cellular service selected by the customer and the particular plan chosen, different customers may have different rates even though they initiate calls at the same time of the day to the same geographic location.
      <br/>
      This customer database may be queried to obtain post call charge information in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Routing information database (RIDB) 214 is a database containing routing information for call processing.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The processes of the present invention may be implemented in a data processing system, such as a switch.
      <br/>
      The present invention also may be implemented in other data processing systems.
      <br/>
      For example, the processes of the present invention may be implemented within a computer having a connection to a switch in which the computer provides the logic and commands to the switch to provide the processes used to provide post call charge information to a customer.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Turning now to FIGS. 3A-3B, block diagrams illustrating physical components of switches are depicted in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention may be implemented.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3A is a physical block diagram of switch 300, which is representative of the DMS family of switch products available from Nortel.
      <br/>
      Switch 300 in FIG. 3A may be implemented within communications system 100, in switches such as switches 104a, 104b, or 104c in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In FIG. 3A, switch 300 includes unit 302 connected to intelligent peripheral 304.
      <br/>
      Unit 302 contains a computing module (CM) 306, which provides switch intelligent functions for switch 300.
      <br/>
      Computing module 306 contains processing unit 308 and memory 310.
      <br/>
      Processing unit 308 may contain, for example, one or more microprocessors for executing instructions to provide logic for call processing and processes for providing post call charge information in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Memory 310 stores instructions and data and may include random access memory (RAM) and/or read only memory (ROM).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Unit 302 also includes enhanced network (ENET) 312, which provides a switch fabric function.
      <br/>
      Digital receiver 316 provides DTMF functions.
      <br/>
      Unit 302 also contains routing information database 318 similar to RIDB 214 in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Voice server functions are provided by intelligent peripheral (IP) 306. Additionally, intelligent peripheral also contains digital receiver 320.
      <br/>
      Digital receivers 316 and 320 may provide voice recognition functions in place of or in addition to recognizing DTMF tones.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Switch 300 has a connection to customer database (CDB) 322, which is external to switch 300.
      <br/>
      Customer database 322 is in communication with unit 302 through enhanced network 312.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Turning now to FIG. 3B, a physical block diagram of physical components in an intelligent network (IN) 350 is depicted in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the depicted example, intelligent network 350 is representative of an International Telecommunications Union switch defined by ITU-T Q.1200. Intelligent network 350 includes a service control point (SCP) 352, which is the switch intelligence for intelligent network 350.
      <br/>
      Within service control point 352 is a processor unit 354 and a memory 356, which contain the processing logic for providing pre-call rate processing in the depicted example.
      <br/>
      Additionally, service control point 352 also contains routing information database (RIDB) 360. Intelligent network 350 also contains a service switch platform (SSP) 362, which provides switch fabric functions.
      <br/>
      Specialized resource functions (SRFs) 364 and 366 are found within service switch platform 362.
      <br/>
      Specialized resource function (SRF) 364 provides DTMF functions for recognizing signals from consumer premises equipment.
      <br/>
      Intelligent peripheral (IP) 368 also is a part of intelligent network 350 and provides voice server functions.
      <br/>
      Additionally, within intelligent peripheral 368 is specialized resource function 370, which also serves to provide DTMF functions.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, instead of DTMF functions, specialized resource functions 364 and 366 may be employed to provide voice recognition in place of or in addition to recognizing DTMF tones.
      <br/>
      Specialized service control point 352 is in communication with customer database (CDB) 372, which is external to intelligent network 350.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Although in the depicted examples in FIGS. 1, 2, 3A and 3B, the processes of the present invention are implemented in a switch, the present invention also may be implemented in other data processing systems.
      <br/>
      For example, the processes of the present invention may be implemented within a computer having a connection to a switch in which the computer provides the logic and commands to the switch to provide the processes used to determine post call charge information for a customer after termination of a call, which in the depicted examples are a long distance or cellular phone call.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      With reference now to FIG. 4, a flowchart of a process for determining post call charge information is illustrated in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The process begins with the initiation of a phone call from a customer through a communications unit (step 400).
      <br/>
      A determination is made as to whether a customer has selected the post call charge information feature (step 402).
      <br/>
      The customer may select this post call information feature by prefixing the call with a special dialing option such as "*58".
      <br/>
      The indication that the post call charge information is desired also may be accomplished through PRI data messaging.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the customer may be prompted through a voice prompt or a data message to indicate whether the post call charge feature is desired.
      <br/>
      If the customer has selected the feature, the process proceeds to standard processing of the call (step 404).
      <br/>
      Standard processing for the call involves the procedures normally used to connect a caller at a source communications unit to a called party at a target communications unit within a communications system.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The process then detects a termination of the call (step 406) and queries a customer database to determine the total cost of the completed call (step 408).
      <br/>
      A determination is then made as to whether the query has been successfully completed (step 410).
      <br/>
      If the query is successfully completed, the process then presents the post call charge information to the caller through an automated voice message or data message that reports the total cost of the call (step 412) with the process terminating thereafter.
      <br/>
      For example, if a voice message is used, the process may send the following message: "The cost of your call to (817) 679-2600 at 3:52 p.m. is $6.85 and your call lasted 28 minutes".
      <br/>
      With reference again to step 410, if the query to the customer database for charge information is not successfully completed, the process sends an automated voice or data message reporting that the query has failed (step 411).
      <br/>
      In this instance, the call completes without providing the caller a message containing the post call charge information.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a message may be provided to the caller stating that the system is presently unable to determine the post call charge information.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      With reference again to step 402, if the customer has not selected the post call charge information feature, a determination is made as to whether the post call charge feature is a default (step 414).
      <br/>
      If the post call charge feature is a default feature, the process then proceeds to step 404 as described above.
      <br/>
      The post call charge feature can be a standard or a default feature that is present each time a customer initiates a phone call that involves charges.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the post call charge feature is not a default feature, the process proceeds to step 416 for standard processing of the call.
      <br/>
      The process then detects a termination of the call (step 418), and then a determination is made as to whether the customer has sent a signal indicating selection of the post call charge feature (step 420).
      <br/>
      If the customer has selected the feature, the process then proceeds to step 408, as described above.
      <br/>
      If the customer has not selected the feature, the process ends.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The flowchart in FIG. 4 illustrates three places at which the post-call charges query may be activated--activation as a default service, initiated prior to the call of interest, or initiated after the call of interest has taken place.
      <br/>
      If the charge message is given as a voice announcement, then it takes some time for the customer to listen to the message.
      <br/>
      A number of reasons may exist for which a customer may not wish to hear this announcement for every potentially billable call, such as a) the called party did not answer, so no charges were incurred; b) the call was very brief, so the customer may be unconnected about the charges; c) the customer needs to attend to something else, and is unavailable to listen to the announcement; or d) the customer desires to immediately make another call.
      <br/>
      Therefore, having the service enabled by default may be unconcerned if the message is delivered as a voice announcement.
      <br/>
      By comparison, a data message, which may, for instance, show up as a message on a display similar to a caller-id box, may be readily ignored by the customer, so enabling the service as a default might be appropriate for a data-message implementation of the service (unless, of course, the customer is charged per use).
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Post-call activation of the service is preferable in some cases.
      <br/>
      A customer may not decide that the service is useful until the customer has been on the phone for an extended period of time.
      <br/>
      After completing the call, the customer knows whether he/she is interested in finding out the charges on the call the customer just completed, so a post-call activation makes sense when possible.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, if the call requires an extended procedure to obtain access for making a call, then this procedure must be repeated if the customer has disconnected from the phone call.
      <br/>
      For example, if a customer makes a long distance phone call using a calling card, then the customer first dials a toll-free access number, waits for a prompt, enters an authorization code, waits for another prompt, and then enters in the called number.
      <br/>
      After disconnecting from the phone call, simply picking up the phone and dialing "*58" (for example) could not work, because these digits get sent to the local service provider rather than the company that provides the calling card service.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the customer would have to redial the access number and authorization code to reconnect to the service provider before activating the post-call charges query.
      <br/>
      One way around this is to take advantage of reorigination if available.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Some call types require a customer to call an access number and then enter in an authorization code before dialing the called number.
      <br/>
      To make subsequent calls easier, some providers offer reorigination, which allows a customer to make a subsequent call by pressing the "-" button followed by another called number.
      <br/>
      Thus, reorigination allows the customer to only enter the access number and authorization code once when making more than one call.
      <br/>
      The current process may build upon reorigination to allow the customer to activate the post-call charges feature rather than another called number.

      The process begins by the initiation of a phone call by a customer (step 500).
      <br/>
      Standard processing of the phone call occurs (step 502), and then the call completes (step 504).
      <br/>
      The customer initiates reorigination (step 506) and a determination is made as to whether the customer selects the post call charge feature (step 508).
      <br/>
      If the customer does not select the post call charge feature, the process then initiates standard processing to handle customer reorigination (step 510) with the process terminating thereafter.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      If the customer selects the post call charge feature, a database query for the total cost of the previous call is made (step 512).
      <br/>
      A determination is then made as to whether the query is successfully completed (step 514).
      <br/>
      Successful completion of the query results in an automated voice or data message recording the total cost of the call to the customer (step 516) with the process terminating thereafter.

      If post call or default activation is unsuitable, the process begins by initiation of the call by a customer (step 700).
      <br/>
      A determination is then made as to whether the customer selects the feature providing post call charge information (step 702).
      <br/>
      If the customer does not select the feature, then standard processing of the call occurs (step 704) with the process terminating thereafter.
