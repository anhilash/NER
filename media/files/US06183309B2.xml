    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention relates to an electrical receptacle and, more particularly, to a molded female electrical receptacle having tapered openings and tapered connectors.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Electrical receptacles are common devices fastened to an end of an electrical conductor wire to allow connection with another electrical conductor wire that is fitted with an electrical plug.
      <br/>
      The receptacle contains a plurality of apertures, each of which access one conductor strand of the conductor wire.
      <br/>
      Each conductor wire is fastened to some type of coupling connector that is held within the receptacle at each aperture.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows an example of one type of coupling connector that is fastened to a conductor wire.
      <br/>
      The plug contains a like number of blades, each of which is fastened to one conductor strand of the other conductor wire.
      <br/>
      Inserting the plug blades into the receptacle apertures, and the coupling connectors therein, connects the conductor strands of the two conductor wires, thereby making an electrical connection.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1 the plug blade enters the vertical slot adjacent the two curved sections C of the coupling connector.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Many receptacles and plugs are produced separately and then fastened by hand to each conductor wire to provide suitable electrical connection for the conductor wires.
      <br/>
      A more permanent connector system employs molding of an electrically insulating plastic or rubber receptacle or plug directly on the end of a conductor wire.
      <br/>
      The coupling connectors or plug blades are first fastened to each strand of the conductor wire, then the outer covering is formed over the wire with blades or the coupling connector fastened thereto.
      <br/>
      Injection molding of the receptacle or plug end coverings of wires employs a molten thermoplastic material injected into a mold containing the appropriate wires with the appropriate connector end fastened thereto.
      <br/>
      The production of a receptacle generally employs some type of pin, positioned at each coupling connector, to form the aperture that later accepts the plug blade.
      <br/>
      After the thermoplastic material sets or cools, the mold and pins are removed, releasing the resulting receptacle or plug end of the wire.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The thermoplastic materials used to form the plug and the receptacle undergo shrinkage in the transformation from a hot molten condition to a cool solidified condition during the molding process.
      <br/>
      The magnitude of shrinkage for the thermoplastic materials is found to vary with the specific material used, as well as the process temperature and the environmental conditions present during production.
      <br/>
      Variation in material shrinkage causes variation in dimensions between the plug blades and, most importantly between the apertures accessing the coupling connectors within the receptacle.
      <br/>
      This problem is particularly important when producing small dimension receptacles and plugs.
      <br/>
      The plug blades extending from the molded plug provide some degree of adjustment by slight bending.
      <br/>
      The receptacle apertures and internal connectors cannot be adjusted to any degree.
      <br/>
      Thus, the molded receptacle requires production with high precision.
      <br/>
      Some examples of inventions concerned with electrical receptacles and plugs have been granted patents.

      Referring to FIG. 2, the female connector member 10 of the present invention is shown.
      <br/>
      The connector member 10 is made of an electrically conductive material such as copper, brass or ferrous based alloy.
      <br/>
      The connector member 10 has a U-shaped section 12 with a first end 14 and a second end 16 and a transverse bottom section 18.
      <br/>
      The U-shaped section first end 14 has vertical sides 20 that are flanged outwardly to enlarge the connector member first end 14 to more readily accept an electrical blade from a male plug.
      <br/>
      A connector linear section 22 extends from the traverse bottom section 18 of the second end 16 of the U-shaped section 12.
      <br/>
      The linear section 22 has a first pair of crimping arm members 24 positioned adjacent the U-shaped section 12, and a second pair of crimping arm members 26 positioned opposite the U-shaped section 12 and at the end of the connector member 10.
      <br/>
      Both crimping arm pairs 24, 26 are co-linear with the connector U-shaped section 12.
      <br/>
      The crimping arm pairs 24, 26 are used to securely attach an insulated electrical conductor wire to the female connector member 10.
      <br/>
      The first pair of crimping arm members 24 are sized to accept and crimp upon a bare conductor wire member 28.
      <br/>
      The second pair of crimping arm members 26 are sized to accept and crimp upon a conductor wire member 28 with an insulation covering 30.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the first pair of crimping arm members 24 are smaller than the second pair of crimping arm members 26.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Referring to FIG. 3, the insulating sleeve member 50 of the present invention is shown.
      <br/>
      The sleeve member 50 is preferably made of a plastic material and includes a generally rectangular base member 52 with a first end 54 and a second end 56, and having a pair of open top chambers 58 therein separated by an open top channel 60, which is also open to the base member second end 56.
      <br/>
      The first end 54 of the base member 52 extends slightly above the open top chambers 58 therein.
      <br/>
      The overhanging top edges 62 of the channel 60 are designed for interlocking with the cap member as described below.
      <br/>
      The base member first end 54 has a pair of generally rectangular apertures 64, with each aperture 64 accessing one of the open top chambers 58.
      <br/>
      The rectangular apertures 64 taper from exterior to interior of the base member first end 54.
      <br/>
      Also included in the base member first end 54 is a guide way opening 66 that accesses the open top channel 60.
      <br/>
      The base member second end 56 contains a pair of positioning slots 68, with each slot 68 accessing one of the open top chambers 58.
      <br/>
      Each slot 68 is located at the top edge of the base member second end 56.
      <br/>
      The base member second end 56 is shown in more detail in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The open top chambers 58 are sized to accept the U-shaped section 12 of the female connector member 10 with the linear section 22 of the connector member 10 positioned in the base member positioning slot 68 as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The attached conductor wire member 28 and pairs of crimping arm members 24, 26 are thereby positioned exterior the insulating sleeve member 50.
      <br/>
      The female connector member 10 of FIG. 2, with attached conductor wire member 28, is inverted for insertion into one base member chamber 58 as depicted in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The tapered apertures 64 are sized to prevent the U-shaped section 12 of the connector member 10 from entering the aperture 64.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Referring again to FIG. 3, the insulating sleeve member 50 also includes a generally rectangular cap member 70 sized to cover the base member pair of open top chambers 58 and open top channel 60.
      <br/>
      The cap member 70 has interlocking means for engaging the base member open top channel 60, thereby securely fastening the cap member thereto.
      <br/>
      The cap member 70 has top 72 and bottom 74 sides, with the interlocking means comprising a pair of J-shaped leg portions 76 that extend from the cap member bottom side 74 and extend the full length of the cap member 70.
      <br/>
      The hook-like ends 78 of the J-shaped leg portions 76 are oriented in opposite directions with a guide way channel 80 separating the leg portions 76.
      <br/>
      The pair of J-shaped leg portions 76 fit into the base member open top channel 60 with the hook-like ends 78 interlocking with the overhanging top edges 62 of the channel.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the cap member 70 may contain downward turned edges 82 which fit into corresponding grooves 84 in the top of the base member 50 for a secure fit.
      <br/>
      The cap member 70 may be positioned on the base member 52 by sliding the cap member 70 on from the base member second end 56 with the cap member leg portions 76 entering the open end of the channel 60.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the cap member 70 may be snapped into position from above the base member 52 with the hook ends 78 of each leg portion 76 deflecting around the channel overlapping top edges 62, and then interlocking therewith.

    <p num="30">
      To form the molded female electrical receptacle assembly 100, the sleeve assembly 50 with U-shaped portions 12 of a pair of connector members 10 positioned therein, with each connector 10 fastened to one wire of an insulated two-wire conductor 30, is encased in a molded insulating material of any desired shape, producing the assembly 100.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 6, the body member 110 of molded insulating material is produced by conventional molding techniques as described above.
      <br/>
      The body member 110 is produced with a pair of generally rectangular apertures 112 with inwardly tapering sides 114 by inserting appropriately tapered pins into the apertures 64 of the sleeve member 50.
      <br/>
      Each aperture 112 produced is positioned in register with a tapered aperture 64 in the first end 54 of the insulating sleeve base member 52, with the U-shaped section 12 of a connector member 10 contained therein.
      <br/>
      Thus, the molded female receptacle assembly 100 contains a pair of apertures 112, which taper to the flanged edge 20 of the connector 10.
      <br/>
      A cut away view of the completed female receptacle assembly 100 is shown in FIG. 6, with the two-wire insulated conductor member 32 protruding from the end of the molded body member 110 opposite the pair of apertures 112.
      <br/>
      The tapering of all apertures and connector ends provides for extremely simple insertion of the blade members of an electrical plug into the apertures of the female receptacle assembly 100.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The insulating sleeve member 50 securely holds the female connector member 10 in position during the molding process and prevents molten molding thermoplastic from entering the chambers 58 of the sleeve member 50 containing the U-shaped sections 12.
      <br/>
      The tapered pins of the mold die also seal the sleeve apertures 64 from the molten thermoplastic.
      <br/>
      The guide way opening 66 in the base member first end 54, and the guide way channel 80 of the cap member 72, provide a pathway for the flow of molten molding thermoplastic into and through the channel 60 of the sleeve member 50 during the molding process.
      <br/>
      The insulating sleeve member 50 with contained female connector members 10 prevents movement of the female connector members 10 during the molding process, thereby producing a dimensionally consistent female electrical receptacle assembly 100.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the tapered apertures 114 of the molded body member 110, the sleeve tapered apertures 64 and the flanged ends 20 of the connector member 10 all provide an unimpeded opening that readily accepts the blade of an electrical plug inserted therein.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In some situations, the insulating sleeve assembly 50 is not needed to accommodate the female connector members 10 of the molded assembly.
      <br/>
      In an alternative embodiment of the invention, shown in FIG. 7, a molded female receptacle assembly 200 is shown in cut away view.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment the pair of female connector members 10, with U-shaped sections 12 having flared vertical sides 20 at a first end 14, are connected to each wire 30 of a two-wire insulated conductor 32 by means of the pairs of crimping arm members 24, 26 on each connector 10.
      <br/>
      The connectors 10 and attached conductor wires 30 are encased within a molded insulating body member body 210.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a tapered pin of the die mold is inserted into the flanged end 20 of each female connector member 10 with connected conductor wire 30 attached thereto.
      <br/>
      After injection of the molten thermoplastic material and solidification of the material, the mold and accompanying pins are removed to produce the molded female receptacle assembly 200 shown in cut away view in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Again, the body member 210 is produced with a pair of generally rectangular apertures 212 with inwardly tapering sides 214.
      <br/>
      Each aperture 212 is positioned in register with the U-shaped section 12 of a connector member 10 contained therein.
      <br/>
