    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to patch antennas applicable mobile or wireless communications systems and more particularly, to a single-mode patch antenna for circularly polarized waves and a dual-mode patch antenna operable as a linearly polarized antenna at a frequency and a circularly polarized antenna at another frequency, which are capable of easy optimization in both impedance matching and axial ratio adjustment.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">In the field of mobile communication, various types of patch antennas have been extensively used because of their advantage of compactness, which are equipped with a plate-shaped dielectric substrate and a conductor patch formed on the surface of the substrate.</p>
    <p num="5">FIG. 1 shows a prior art circularly polarized patch antenna, which is shown based on the paper written by P. C. Sharma et al., "Analysis and Optimized Design of Single Feed Circularly Polarized Microstrip Antenna", IEEE TAP 1983, Vol., AP-31, No. 6, pp. 949-955.</p>
    <p num="6">
      In FIG. 1, a rectangular conductor patch 151 serving as a radiating element is formed on the surface of a rectangular dielectric substrate 150.
      <br/>
      The two long sides of the patch 151 have a length of L1 and two short sides thereof have L2.
      <br/>
      A plate-shaped grounding conductor 153 serving as a ground plane is formed on the opposite surface of the substrate 150 to the patch 151.
      <br/>
      The reference numeral 152 denotes a feedpoint through which electric power is fed to the patch 151.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The above-described prior-art patch antenna of FIG. 1 has the following problem.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Specifically, with the prior-art patch antenna shown in FIG. 1, electric power is supplied to the patch 151 through the single feedpoint 152 and the antenna structure is very simple.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a problem that a degree of freedom to optimize both the axial ratio setting for circularly polarized waves and the impedance matching at a specific frequency is insufficient.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Also, a monopole or dipole may be additionally provided as an additional radiating element above the patch 151 in order to add another antenna function.
      <br/>
      In this case, to form a way of feeding electric power to the monopole or dipole thus added, a square or rectangular aperture needs to be formed in the patch 151 to expose the underlying surface of the dielectric substrate 150.
      <br/>
      However, the aperture causes another problem that the location adjustment of the feedpoint 152 becomes more difficult.
      <br/>
      Also, it causes a further problem that unwanted shift of the axial ratio of elliptically polarized waves is generated and this shift cannot be fully compensated by simply changing the location of the feedpoint 152.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      FIG. 2 shows another prior-art circularly polarized patch antenna usable at two different frequencies of f1 and f2, which is a dual-frequency antenna.
      <br/>
      This is shown based on the paper written by D. Sanchez-Hernandez et al., "Single-fed dual band circularly polarized microstrip patch antennas", 26th EuMc 9-12 Sep. 1996, Prague, pp. 273-277.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In FIG. 2, a rectangular patch 257 serving as a radiating element is formed on the surface of a rectangular dielectric substrate 255.
      <br/>
      The shape and size of the patch 257 are designed to have a resonant frequency at f1.
      <br/>
      A plate-shaped grounding conductor 253 serving as a ground plane is formed on the opposite surface of the substrate 255 to the patch 257.
      <br/>
      The reference numeral 256 denotes a feedpoint through which electric power is fed to the patch 257.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Unlike the prior-art antenna shown in FIG. 1, the patch 257 has a L-shaped slit 258A formed near its long side 257a and a L-shaped slit 258B formed near its short side 257b.
      <br/>
      The slit 258A extends inwardly by a specific length from a point on the long side 257a and then, bends at a right angle and runs parallel to the side 257a by a specific length.
      <br/>
      The part of the slit 258A which is parallel to the long side 257a is longer than that which is perpendicular thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Similarly, the slit 258B extends inwardly by a specific length from a point on the long side 257b and then, bends at a right angle and runs parallel to the side 257b by a specific length.
      <br/>
      The part of the slit 258B which is parallel to the long side 257b is longer than that which is perpendicular thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Here, it is supposed that the parts of the slits 258A and 258B, which are respectively in parallel to the long and short sides 257a and 257b, have a same width of SLSL and a same length of LSL.
      <br/>
      If the values of the width WLSL and the length LSL are suitably adjusted, a filter effect is generated due to the existence of the slits 258A and 258B, resulting in a resonant frequency at f2 which is different from f1.
      <br/>
      Thus, the prior-art patch antenna shown in FIG. 2 have two resonant frequencies at f1 and f2, which means that it serves as a double-frequency antenna.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      With the prior art patch antenna shown in FIG. 2, however, if a square or rectangular aperture is formed in the patch 257a in order to add a monopole or dipole over the patch 257 as an additional radiating element, the difficulty in location adjustment of the feedpoint 256 is increased due to existence of the slots 258A and 258B.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since the axial ratio adjustment and the impedance matching become more difficult than the prior art patch antenna shown in FIG. 1, the addition of a monopole or dipole above the patch 257 is extremely difficult to be realized.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      To increase the ease in the axial ratio adjustment and impedance matching at different frequencies, several methods have been developed and proposed.
      <br/>
      However, all the proposed methods require to provide two arrays of patches on a same dielectric substrate.
      <br/>
      As a result, a large space of patches is necessary and the size of an antenna is increased, which is contrary to the advantage of compactness of patch antennas.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Furthermore, the difficulty in the axial ratio adjustment and the impedance matching is increased by the L-shaped slots 258A and 258B, because the addition of the slots 258A and 258B generates some deviation in the axial ratio and/or the matched impedance.</p>
    <p num="18">
      Actual communications systems require low-cost, small-sized circularly polarized antennas having a well-adjusted axial ratio and a well-matched impedance.
      <br/>
      However, as far as the inventors know, the prior-art antennas including the above-described antennas shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 provide only one of a well-adjusted axial ratio and a well-matched impedance.
      <br/>
      This means that the prior-art antennas essentially requires a compromise between the axial ratio adjustment and the impedance matching.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      On th other hand, in recent years, there have been the growing need for dual-mode patch antennas capable of operation as a linearly polarized antenna at a frequency and a circularly polarized antenna at another frequency.
      <br/>
      This need is one the basis of the intention to cope with several different communication systems, such as the ground wave communication systems using linearly polarized waves and the satellite communication systems using circularly polarized waves.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As explained previously, the prior-art patch antenna shown in FIG. 2 is operable at the two different frequencies f1 and f2.
      <br/>
      However, this antenna is dedicated to circularly polarized waves.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if it is applied to linearly polarized waves, it will produce a lot of cross polarization components.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is unable to be operated as a dual-mode patch antenna.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 3 shows a prior-art dual-mode patch antenna, which is equipped with two patches designed respectively for circularly and linearly polarized waves.
      <br/>
      This antenna is shown based on the same paper written by P. C. Sharma et al. as that cited with reference to FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As shown in FIG. 3, a first rectangular patch 362 and a second parallelogrammic patch 363 are formed on the surface of a rectangular dielectric substrate 361.
      <br/>
      These two patches 362 and 363 are apart from each other at a short distance.
      <br/>
      A plate-shaped grounding conductor 364 serving as a ground plane is formed on the opposite surface of the substrate 361 to the patches 362 and 363.
      <br/>
      The reference number 365 denotes a feedpoint through which electric power is supplied to the first patch 362.
      <br/>
      The reference numeral 366 denotes a microstrip line formed on the surface of the substrate 361 to be connected to the second patch 363 at its short side.
      <br/>
      The line 366 is designed for supplying electric power to the second patch 363.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The first patch 362, which is used for circularly polarized waves, has a shape of a parallelogram with two long sides 362a and 362c of SL1 and two short sides 362b and 362d of SL3.
      <br/>
      By setting precisely the location of the feedpoint 365 on the patch 362, the impedance matching and the axial ratio setting can be suitably established at a desired frequency (i.e., a first frequency).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The second patch 363, which is used for linearly polarized waves, has a shape of a rectangle with two long sides (i.e., resonant sides) 363aand 363c of RL and two short sides (i.e., non-resonant sides) 363b and 363d of RW perpendicular to the long sides.
      <br/>
      The resonance length of the patch 363 is set to be equal to a half wavelength at another desired frequency (i.e., a second frequency).
    </p>
    <p num="25">The first and second patches 362 and 363 and the microstrip line 366 are formed on the dielectric sheet 361 by a well-known printing process or the like.</p>
    <p num="26">
      With the prior-art dual-mode patch antenna shown in FIG. 3, the first parallelogrammic patch 362 dedicated to circularly polarized waves and the second rectangular patch 363 dedicated to linearly polarized waves are provided on the same dielectric substrate 361.
      <br/>
      Therefore, to prevent the electromagnetic coupling between the patches 362 and 363, these patches 362 and 363 need to be located apart from each other at a specific distance or longer.
      <br/>
      As a result, this antenna has a problem that it occupies a larger space than that having a single patch and that it raises the fabrication cost.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Moreover, the use of the two patches 362 and 363 may cause another problem that the volume required by the two patches 362 and 363 generates a difficulty in mechanical support of the antenna.
      <br/>
      It may cause a further problem that two feed systems are necessary to supply electric power to the patches 362 and 363, resulting in a high antenna profile.

    <p num="29">Another object of the present invention to provide a patch antenna having an improved degree of freedom to optimize the axial ratio adjustment and the impedance matching.</p>

    <p num="32">The above objects together with others not specifically mentioned will become clear to those skilled in the art from the following description.</p>
    <p num="33">
      According to a first aspect of the present invention, a circularly polarized patch antenna is provided.
      <br/>
      This antenna is comprised of
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      (a) a dielectric substrate having a first surface located on one side and a second surface located on the other side;
      <br/>
      (b) an approximately rectangular patch serving as a radiating element formed on the first surface of the substrate;
      <br/>
      the patch having an aperture from which the first surface of the substrate is exposed, a first side, and a second side adjoining to the first side;
      <br/>
      the first side having a first slot that inwardly extends approximately perpendicular to the first side;
      <br/>
      the second side having a second slot that inwardly extends approximately perpendicular to the second side;
      <br/>
      (c) a ground conductor serving as a ground plane formed on the second surface of the substrate to be opposite to the patch; and
      <br/>
      (d) a feedpoint located on the patch for feeding or deriving electric power to or from the patch.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      With the circularly polarized patch antenna according to the first aspect of the present invention, the first side of the approximately rectangular patch has the first slot that inwardly extends approximately perpendicular to the first side and the second side thereof has the second slot that inwardly extends approximately perpendicular to the second side.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the effect due to the aperture of the patch can be compensated by the action of the first and second slots.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      As a result, both the axial ratio adjustment and the impedance matching can be optimized easily by suitably setting the size and number of the fist and second slots if popular computer simulation or the like is utilized.
      <br/>
      In other words, this patch antenna has an improved degree of freedom to optimize the axial ratio adjustment and the impedance matching.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In a preferred embodiment of the antenna according to the first apsect, the first side of the patch further has a least one additional slot and the second side of the patch further has at least one additional slot.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, there is an additional advantage that the effect due to the aperture of the patch can be compensated more easily.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The first slot and the additional slot of the first side may be equal to or different from each other in width and/or length.
      <br/>
      The second slot and the additional slot of the second side may be equal to or different from each other in width and/or length.
      <br/>
      The gap between the first slot and the additional slot of the first side may be equal to or different from that between the second slot and the additional slot of the second side.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      According to a second aspect of the present invention, another circularly polarized patch antenna is provided, which is comprised of
      <br/>
      (a) a dielectric substrate having a first surface located on one side and a second surface located on the other side;
      <br/>
      (b) an approximately rectangular first patch serving as a first radiating element formed on the first surface of the substrate;
      <br/>
      the first patch having an aperture from which the first surface of the substrate is exposed, a first side, and a second side adjoining to the first side;
      <br/>
      the first side having a first slot that inwardly extends approximately perpendicular to the first side;
      <br/>
      the second side having a second slot that inwardly extends approximately perpendicular to the second side;
      <br/>
      (c) a dielectric layer formed on the first surface or the substrate to cover entirely the first patch;
      <br/>
      (d) an approximately rectangular second patch serving as a second radiating element formed on a surface of the dielectric layer;
      <br/>
      the second patch having a second aperture from which the surface of the dielectric layer is exposed, a third side, and a fourth side adjoining to the third side;
      <br/>
      the third side having a third slot that inwardly extends approximately perpendicular to the third side;
      <br/>
      the fourth side having a fourth slot that inwardly extends approximately perpendicular to the fourth side;
      <br/>
      (e) a ground conductor serving as a ground plane formed on the second surface of the substrate to be opposite to the first patch;
      <br/>
      (f) a first feedpoint located on the first path for reading or deriving electric power to or from the first patch; and
      <br/>
      (g) a second feedpoint located on the second patch for feeding or deriving electric power to or from the second patch.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      With the circularly polarized patch antenna according to the second aspect of the present invention, the dielectric layer and the second patch are added to the circularly polarized antenna according to the first aspect.
      <br/>
      Therefore, because of the same reason as that of the antenna according to the first aspect, both the axial ratio adjustment and the impedance matching can be optimized easily.
      <br/>
      In other words, the patch antenna according to the second aspect has an improved degree of freedom to optimize both the axial ratio adjustment and the impedance matching.
      <br/>
      Unlike the antenna according to the first aspect, the antenna according to the second aspect is operable at two different frequencies.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In a preferred embodiment of the antenna according to the second aspect, the first side of the first patch further has at least one additional slot, the second side of the first patch further has at least one additional slot, the third side of the second patch further has at least one addition slot, and the fourth side of the second patch further has at least one additional slot.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, there is an additional advantage that the effect due to the aperture of the patch can be compensated more easily.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="59">Preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below while referring to the drawings attached.</p>
    <p num="60">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="61">
      A circularly polarized patch antenna according to a first embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, which is connected to an unillustrated matching network for impedance matching between the antenna and a feed system.
      <br/>
      Since this connection is very popular, the explanation about that is omitted here for simplification of description.
    </p>
    <p num="62">As shown in FIG. 4, the patch antenna according to the first embodiment is comprised of a dielectric substrate 4 having a thickness of TC and a dielectric constant of P1, an approximately rectangular conductor patch 1 serving as a radiating element formed on the upper surface of the substrate 4, and a rectangular plate-shaped ground conductor 3 serving as a ground plane formed on the lower surface of the substrate 4 to be opposite to the patch 1.</p>
    <p num="63">
      As clearly shown in FIG. 5, the patch 1 has two lone sides 1a and 1c with the same length of L1 and two short sides 1b and 1d with the same length of L2, where L1&gt;L2.
      <br/>
      The patch 1 has a rectangular aperture 7 that exposes the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 4 from the patch 1.
      <br/>
      The aperture 7 is formed to provide an additional antenna element such as a monopole or dipole onto the upper surface of the substrate 4 while electrically separating the additional antenna element from the patch 1.
      <br/>
      The aperture 1 has two long sides 7a and 7c with the same length of D1 and two short sides 7b and 7d with the same length of D2, where D1&gt;D2.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The corner 7e of the aperture 7 is the nearest to the corner 1e of the patch 1.
      <br/>
      The corner 7e is apart from the adjoining short side 1b of the patch 1 by a distance E1 and from the adjoining long side 1a of the patch 1 by a distance E2.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      A feedpoint 2 for feeding electric power to the patch 1 is located at a point nearest to the corner 1g of the patch 1 opposite to the corner is thereof.
      <br/>
      The feedpoint 2 is apart from the adjoining short side 1d of the patch 1 by a distance G1 and from the adjoining long side 1c of the patch 1 by a distance G2.
      <br/>
      Electric power is supplied to the patch 1 from its backside at the feedpoint 2 by way of a feed line (not shown) which is electrically connected to the feedpoint 2 through the substrate 4.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The patch 1 includes three rectangular slots 6A, 6B, and 6C at its long side 1a and three rectangular slots 6D, 6E, and 6F at its short side 1b.
      <br/>
      The slots 6A, 6B, and 6C, which are located near the corner 1h of the patch 1, extend inwardly from the long side 1a to be perpendicular thereto.
      <br/>
      In other words, the slots 6A, 6B, and 6C extend in parallel to the short sides 1b and 1d.
      <br/>
      The widths of the slots 6A, 6B, and 6C are defined as W1, W2, and W3, and the lengths thereof are as Len1, Len2, and Len3, respectively.
      <br/>
      The slots 6A and 6B are apart from each other at a distance of Gepl, and a the slots 6B and 6C are at a distance of Sep2.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The slots 6D, 6E, and 6F, which are located near the corner 1f of the patch 1 opposite to its corner 1h, extend inwardly from the short side 1h to be perpendicular thereto.
      <br/>
      In other words, the slots 6D, 6E, and 6F extend in parallel to the long sides 1aand 1c and perpendicular to the short sides 1b and 1d.
      <br/>
      The widths of the slots 6D, 6E, and 6F are defined as W4, W5, and W6, and the lengths thereof are as Len4, Len5, and Len6, respectively.
      <br/>
      The slots 6D and 6E are apart from each other at a distance of Sep4, and the slots 6E and 6F are at a distance of Sep5.
    </p>
    <p num="68">By suitably setting the values of the widths W1, W2, W3, W4, W5, and W6, the lengths Len1, Len2, Len3, Len4, Len5, and Len6, and the distance Sep1, Sep2, Sep3, and Sep4 of the slots 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E, and 6F, both the axial ratio setting and the impedance matching can be optimized at a desired frequency f1.</p>
    <p num="69">
      It is needless to say that the values of the widths W1, W2, W3, W4, W5, and W6 may be equal to or different from each other according to the necessity.
      <br/>
      This is applied to the values of the lengths Len1, Len2, Len3, Len4, Len5, and Len6, and those of the distances Sep1, Sep2, Sep3, and Sep4.
    </p>
    <p num="70">A numerical example of the patch 1 is shown below.</p>
    <p num="71">
      The dielectric substrate 4 is formed by a polyphenylene oxide (PPO) sheet or plate with the thickness TC of 3.2 mm and the dielectric constant P1 of 10.
      <br/>
      The patch 1 has the long side length L1 of 19.32 mm and the short side length L2 of 18.29 mm, which is formed by a well-known printing process.
      <br/>
      The rectangular aperture 7 has the long side length D1 of 7 mm and the short side length D2 of 6.726 mm. The distances E1 and E2 of the aperture 7 are both set as 3.5 mm. The distances G1 and G2 of the feedpoint 2 are 8.26 mm and 8.1 mm, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The widths W1, W2, and W3 of the three slots 6A, 6B, and 6C on the long side 1a are 0.5 mm. The lengths Len1, Len2, and Len3 of the three slots 6A, 6B, and 6C are 2 mm.
      <br/>
      The distances Scp1 and Scp2 are 0.5 mm. The widths W4, W5, and W6 of the three slots 6C, 6D, and 6E on the short side 1b are 0.5 mm, which are equal to those of the slots 6A, 6B, and 6C.
      <br/>
      The lengths Len4, Len5, and Len6 of the three slots 6D, 6E, and 6F are 2 mm, which are equal to those of the slots 6A, 6B, and 6C.
      <br/>
      The distances Sep4 and Sep5 are 0.5 mm, which are equal to those of the slots 6A, 6B, and 6C.
      <br/>
      Thus, the six slots 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E, and 6F are equal in size, shape, and distance.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Using the patch antenna according to the first embodiment specified as above, the inventors actually performed computer simulation to obtain the frequency dependence of the axial ratio, the gain, and the component S11 of the S parameter and the radiation pattern.
      <br/>
      The results of the simulation is shown in FIGS. 6 and 7.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      As seen from FIG. 6, the axial ratio of the elliptically polarized waves is minimized at the frequency of 2.2 GHz, which is lower than 1 dB.
      <br/>
      Also, the component S11 of the S parameter, which is defined as the rate of the reflected wave with respect to the incident wave, is minimized at the frequency of 2.2 GHz. This means that the impedance matching between the patch antenna and its feed line is optimized.
      <br/>
      In response to the optimized impedance, the antenna gain is maximized at the same frequency of 2.2 GHz. The impedance matching thus obtained was as high as approximately 14 dB.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The patch antenna according to the first embodiment of FIG. 4 has a radiation pattern shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      As seen from FIG. 7, the antenna has a peak gain of 4.5 dBc in a specific direction and the axial ratio is minimized in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p num="76">As a result, it is seen from FIGS. 6 and 7 that both the axial ratio setting and the impedance matching can be optimized in the antenna according to the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="77">
      FIG. 8 shows the frequency dependence of the axial ratio, the gain, and the component S11 of the S parameter of the antenna according to the first embodiment of FIG. 4, which was obtained by experiments.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 8, the curve AR1 shows the frequency dependence of the axial ratio when the slots 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E, and 6F are removed in the antenna according to the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      The curve AR2 shows the frequency dependence of the axial ratio of the antenna according to the first embodiment having the slots 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E, and 6F.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      As seen from the FIG. 8, the component S11 of the S parameter is minimized (i.e., impedance-matched) at the frequency of 2.2 GHz and the antenna gain is maximized at the same frequency.
      <br/>
      The maximum value of the gain is as high as approximately 4.5 dB. As seen from the curve AR2, the axial ratio is minimized at the frequency of 2.2 GHz when the slots 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E, and 6F are provided.
      <br/>
      When the slots 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E, and 6F are not provided, as seen from the curve AR1, the axial ratio is minimized at the frequency of 2.24 GHz, which is shifted from the desired frequency 2.2 GHz.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      With the patch antenna according to the first embodiment shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, as explained above, the long side 1a of the rectangular patch 1 has the slots 6A, 6B, and 6C that inwardly extends from the side 1a and that is perpendicular to the side 1a, and at the same time, the shirt side 1b of the patch 1 has the slots 6D, 6E, and 6F that inwardly extends from the side 1b and that is approximately perpendicular to the side 1b.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the effect due to the rectangular aperture 7 of the patch 1 can be compensated by the slots 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E, and 6F.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      As a result, the patch antenna according to the first embodiment has an improved degree of freedom to optimize both the axial ratio setting of polarization and the impedance matching between the antenna and its feed line.
      <br/>
      In other words, both the axial ratio setting and the impedance matching can be optimized easily.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      In general, when a rectangular patch for circularly polarized waves is formed on the flat surface of a dielectric substrate, an obtainable antenna gain at a given frequency is determined by the resonant length of the patch.
      <br/>
      Therefore, to minimize the axial ratio while maximizing the level of impedance matching, the location of a feedpoint needs to be optimized.
      <br/>
      However, if an aperture is formed in the patch to expose the underlying surface of the substrate for the purpose of providing an additional antenna element such as an inner dipole, the location of a feedpoint is comparatively difficult to be optimized.
      <br/>
      This will be easily understood from the curve AR1 in FIG. 8.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Unlike this, in the patch antenna according to the first embodiment in FIGS. 3 and 4, the location of a feedpoint is easily optimized because of the slots 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E, and 6F by using computer simulation.
      <br/>
      This will be easily understood from the curve AR2 in FIG. 8.
    </p>
    <p num="83">As described above, in the patch antenna according to the first embodiment, both the satisfactory impedance matching and the minimized axial ratio can be realized while using the single feedpoint 2.</p>
    <p num="84">Second Embodiment</p>
    <p num="85">FIGS. 9 and 10 show a patch antenna according to a second embodiment of the present invention, which is operable at two different frequency bands, i.e., which serves as a double frequency antenna.</p>
    <p num="86">
      This antenna has a configuration obtained by adding a rectangular dielectric layer 24 and a rectangular conductor patch 2 to the antenna according to the first embodiment shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the explanation about the same configuration as that of the first embodiment is omitted here for simplification by attaching the same reference symbols as those in the first embodiment to the same elements in FIG. 9.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      Specifically, the dielectric layer 24, which has a thickness of TC1 and a dielectric constant P2, is formed on the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 4 to be entirely overlapped with the substrate 4.
      <br/>

      FIGS. 11 and 12 show a dual-mode patch antenna according to a third embodiment of the present invention, which is operable as a circularly polarized antenna at a first frequency f1 and as a linearly polarized antenna at a second frequency f2 higher than f1.
      <br/>
      The antenna is connected to an unillustrated matching network for impedance matching between the antenna and a feed system.

    <p num="101">
      As clearly shown in FIG. 12, the patch 51 has two long sides 52 and 53 with the same length of LL1 and two short sides 58 and 59 with the same length of LL2, where LL1&gt;LL2.
      <br/>
      The opposite sides 52 and 53 serve as resonant sides and the opposite sides 58 and 59 as non-resonant sides.

      A microstrip line 57 is formed on the upper surface of the substrate 54 as a feed line for the patch 51.

      The end of the feed line 57 is connected to the patch 51 at substantially the center of the non-resonant side 58.

      The line 57 extends perpendicular to the sides 58 and 59 and in parallel to the sides 52 and 53.

    <p num="102">
      The patch 51 has a parallelogrammic aperture 68 at approximately the center, which exposes the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 54 from the patch 51.
      <br/>
      The aperture 68 is formed to provide another patch 63 onto the upper surface of the substrate 54 while electrically separating the patch 63 from the patch 51.
      <br/>
      The aperture 60 has two edges 60a and 60b with the same length of LL3 and two edges 68c and 68d with the same length of LL4.

      The corner 68e of the aperture 68 has an acute angle  ALPHA .
      <br/>
      The opposite corner of the aperture 68 to the corner 68e is overlapped with the side 59 of the patch 51, thereby communicating the aperture 68 with the outside of the patch 51 through a hole 68f formed at the side 59.

    <p num="103">
      A parallelogrammic conductor patch 63 serving as a radiating element is formed on the upper surface of the substrate 54 in the parallelogrammic aperture 68 of the patch 51.

      The patch 63, which is slightly smaller than the aperture 68, has a shape analogous to that of the aperture 68.

      The patch 63 has two sides 63a and 63b with the same length and two sides 63c and 63d with the same length.

      The rectangular patch 51 serves as a linearly polarized antenna, since the feed line 57 is connected to the center of the non-resonant side 58.

      Also, the parallelogrammic patch 63 serves as a circularly polarized antenna, since the feed line 57a is connected to the corner 63f.

      Moreover, the length LL1 of the resonant sides 52 and 53 of the patch 51 is equal to a half wavelength and the patch 63 is located inside the patch 51.

      Therefore, the patch 63 serving as a circularly polarized antenna operates at a first frequency f1 an the patch 51 serving as a linearly polarized antenna operates at a second frequency f2 higher than f1.

      This means that the patch antenna according to the third embodiment is a dual-mode antenna with the circularly and linearly polarization modes.
