      A method and apparatus for identifying related documents in a collection of linked documents.
      <br/>
      In the method the link structure of documents to other documents are analyzed.
      <br/>
      By analyzing only the link structure, a process intensive content analysis of the documents is avoided.
      <br/>
      A citation analysis technique, such as bibliographic coupling analysis, is performed on the set of documents to extract link information.
      <br/>
      For bibliographic coupling analysis that information would include the number of other documents that a given pair of documents link to.
      <br/>
      By using the link information, related documents are identified using a suitable analysis technique, such as clustering or spreading activation.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention is related to the field of analysis of linked collections of documents, and in particular to analyzing the link structure of documents to identify documents having similar content.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The ever-increasing universe of electronic information, for example as found on the World Wide Web (herein after referred to as the Web), competes for the effectively fixed and limited attention of people.
      <br/>
      Both consumers and producers of information want to understand what kinds of information are available, how desirable it is, and how its content and use change through time.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Making sense of very large collections of linked documents and foraging for information in such environments is difficult without specialized aids.
      <br/>
      Collections of linked documents are often connected together using hypertext links.
      <br/>
      The basic structure of linked hypertext is designed to promote the process of browsing from one document to another along hypertext links, which is unfortunately very slow and inefficient when hypertext collections become very large and heterogeneous.
      <br/>
      Two sorts of aids have evolved in such situations.
      <br/>
      The first are structures or tools that abstract and cluster information in some form of classification system.
      <br/>
      Examples of such would be library card catalogs and the Yahoo� Web site.
      <br/>
      The second are systems that attempt to predict the information relevant to a user's needs and to order the presentation of information accordingly.
      <br/>
      Examples would include search engines such as Lycos, which take a user's specifications of an information need, in the form of words and phrases, and return ranked lists of documents that are predicted to be relevant to the user's need.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Another system which provides aids in searching for information on the Web is the "Recommend" feature provided on the Alexa Internet Web site (URL: http://www.alexa.com).
      <br/>
      The "Recommend" feature provides a list of related Web pages that a user may want to retrieve and view based on the Web page that they are currently viewing.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It has been determined that one way to facilitate information seeking is through automatic categorization of Web Pages.
      <br/>
      One technique for categorization of Web pages is described by P. Pirolli, J. Pitkow and R. Rao in the publication entitled Silk from a Sow's Ear: Extracting Usable Structures from the Web, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 96), Vancouver British Columbia, Canada, April 1996.
      <br/>
      Described therein is a categorization technique wherein each Web page is represented as a feature vector, with features extracted from information about text-content similarity, hypertext connections, and usage patterns.
      <br/>
      Web pages belonging to the same category, may then be clustered together.
      <br/>
      Categorization is computed based on inter-document similarities among these feature vectors.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another aid for making sense of such collections is clustering.
      <br/>
      One way to approach the automatic clustering of linked documents is to adapt the existing approaches of clustering standard text documents.
      <br/>
      Such an approach is described by Cutting et al., in the publication entitled "Scatter/gather: A cluster based approach to browsing large document Collections", The 15th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 318-329, August 1992.
      <br/>
      However, there are several impracticalities with such existing text-clustering techniques.
      <br/>
      Text-based clustering typically involves computing inter-document similarities based on content-word frequency statistics.
      <br/>
      Not only is this often expensive, but, more importantly, its effectiveness was developed and tuned on human-readable texts.
      <br/>
      It appears, though, that the proportion of human-readable source files for Web pages is decreasing with the infusion of dynamic and programmed pages.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Another option for performing clustering of document collections is to look at usage patterns.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, any clustering based on usage patterns requires access to data that is not usually recorded in any easily accessible format.
      <br/>
      In the case of the Web, while a moderate amount of usage information is recorded for each requested document at a particular Web site, the log files for other sites are not publicly accessible.
      <br/>
      Thus while the usage for a particular site can be ascertained, this information is not available for the other 500,000 Web sites that currently exist.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Other attempts at clustering hypertext typically utilize the hypertext link topology of the collection.
      <br/>
      Such techniques are described by R. A. Botafogo, E. Rivlin, and B. Schneiderman, Structural Analysis of Hypertexts: Identifying Hierarchies And Useful Metrics, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 10(2):142-180, 1992.
      <br/>
      Such a basis for clustering makes intuitive sense since the links of a particular document represent what the author felt was of interest to the reader of the document.
      <br/>
      These known clustering methods have been applied to collections with several hundred elements, and do not seem particularly suited to scale gracefully to large heterogeneous collections like the Web, where it has been estimated that there are over 70 million text-based documents which currently exist.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      While clustering or categorizing at the document level is important, it is also desirable to be able to cluster at the collection or web site level.
      <br/>
      Search engines such as Yahoo.RTM. can return results to queries separated into categories, web sites and web pages.
      <br/>
      While this may provide a categorization of sorts relative to the search terms, it does not take into account any relationships that the sites themselves may define.
      <br/>
      For example, a response to a query may return sites A and B. Suppose site A contains links to site X and Site B contains a link to site Y. The set generated as a result of the query does not indicate the relationships between sites A and X or sites B and Y. This is important because of the inconsistent use of terms as meta-data for the sites could result in some relevant sites being missed.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      A system for analyzing a retrieved set of linked documents for the purpose of finding closely related document collections (e.g. web sites) is disclosed.
      <br/>
      The information derived from such a system may be used to aid a user in finding desired information or be fed into other computations useful in analysis of collections of linked documents (e.g. spreading activation), or in creating visualizations of the collections.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The currently preferred embodiment of the present invention is implemented for analyzing collections of linked documents (i.e. Web Pages) residing on the portion of the Internet known as the World Wide Web (hereinafter the Web).
      <br/>
      The Web is the portion of the Internet that is used to store and access linked documents.
      <br/>
      A Web page may have multi-media content as well as relative and absolute links to other pages.
      <br/>
      A Web Site is a collection of related Web pages associated with an entity having a presence on the World Wide Web such as a company, educational institute or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In this description, the term Web page is an instance of a linked document and the two terms may be used interchangeably.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it should be noted that the present invention is not limited to use on the Web and may be utilized in any system which provides access to linked entities, including documents, images, videos, audio, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      It has been observed that a collection of Web pages has a topology that is defined by links contained in the individual Web pages.
      <br/>
      Links are an indicator on a Web page which refers to another Web page and which can typically be retrieved in a point and click fashion.
      <br/>
      The link will specify the address, i.e. Uniform Resource Locator or URL, of the other Web page.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the underlying structure of a Web page.
      <br/>
      As would be known by one of ordinary skill in the art, such a Web page would be typically specified in a mark-up language such as the Hyper-text Mark-Up Language (HTML) or the Extensible Mark-Up Language (XML) and which would be viewable via a Web Browser.
      <br/>
      A Web Browser is a tool which enables a user to traverse through and view documents residing on the Web.
      <br/>
      Other rendering means associated with the Browser will permit listening to audio portions of a document or viewing video or image portions of a document.
      <br/>
      Examples of commercially available Web Browsers include Netscape Navigator (tm) , available from Netscape Communications Corporation, and Internet Explorer (tm) , available from the Microsoft Corporation.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In any event, the Web Page 101 has text content part 102 and links 103-105.
      <br/>
      The text content part 102 is merely the standard text of a document.
      <br/>
      The links 103-105 may be represented on a rendered page as either text (e.g. links 103-104) or image (e.g. link 105).
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 1, when the link is represented as text, it is visually distinct from ordinary text.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1 the links 103 and 104 are underlined.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Making sense of the millions of web pages available on the Web is a daunting and difficult task.
      <br/>
      As a way of circumventing these difficulties, in the currently preferred embodiment of the present invention, co-citation analysis has been utilized as a way to cluster groups of web pages.
      <br/>
      The adaptation of this clustering technique is based solely on the analysis of hypertext link topology of a collection of Web pages.
      <br/>
      Unlike earlier link-topology techniques, co-citation analysis builds upon the notion that when a Web page D contains links referring to documents A and B, then A and B are related in some manner in the mind of the person who produced the document.
      <br/>
      In this example, documents A and B are said to be co-cited.
      <br/>
      It is important to note that links between document A and document B may or may not exist.
      <br/>
      Given this property of picking up patterns from the implicit topological structure of hypertext documents, it has been determined that co-citation analysis is useful in telling us something about the semantic structure of a collection and the thinking of the authoring community.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Overview of Co-Citation Analysis</p>
    <p num="24">
      Citation indexing, the creation of an index that details the explicit linkages of citations between papers, has been employed as a tool to facilitate the searching and the management of information for over a century, dating back to the legal profession's use of the Shepard's Citations in 1873.
      <br/>
      The field underwent major advances during the post World War II increase in scientific expenditures and subsequent explosive increase in the scientific literature.
      <br/>
      With the intent of ensuring information exchange among scientists, the United States government initiated a number of projects to generate indexes without human involvement.
      <br/>
      Citation indexing was found to be a powerful yet simple tool, as it replaces an indexer's subjective judgements with author's citations, thus avoiding many of the semantic problems found in term and title based analyses.
      <br/>
      See the publication E. Garfield. Citation Indexing: ISI Press, Philadelphia, Pa., 1979 for more information.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      It was not until the mid-1970s however that Small and Griffith described a co-citation analysis as a method for measuring the common intellectual interest between a pair of documents.
      <br/>
      See H. Small and B. Griffith. The structure of scientific literatures, Identifying and graphing specialties, Science Studies, 4(17):17-40, 1974.
      <br/>
      The principal component of co-citation analysis measures the number of documents that have cited a given pair of documents together.
      <br/>
      This metric is referred to as co-citation strength.
      <br/>
      Unlike other forms of citation analysis, co-citation strength is able to reflect the frequency of items being cited over time, thus enabling deeper insight into the development of certain research fields and other semantic structures within a citation index.
      <br/>
      Similarly, it has been determined that co-citation analysis yields insight into the implicit semantic structures of the Web.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The original method developed by Small and Griffith takes a citation index as initial input.
      <br/>
      Recall that a citation index is an index that details the explicit linkages of citations between papers.
      <br/>
      For all documents in the index, the number of times a document was cited is computed and those documents whose cited frequency falls above a specific threshold are kept for further processing.
      <br/>
      This prefiltering retains the most important (or at least the most popular) documents.
      <br/>
      Next, the extracted documents are sorted and all pairs of documents that have been cited together by the same source document are formed.
      <br/>
      The resulting list contains unique co-citation pairs and their associated frequency of co-occurrence.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The final step in co-citation analysis creates a set of clusters whose elements are indirectly or directly related by co-citation.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by clustering all documents that have at least one document of the co-citation pair in common with the other elements in the cluster.
      <br/>
      To start, a pair is selected, say AB, and all pairs that contain A or B are added to the cluster.
      <br/>
      Next, all pairs that include a document that have been included in the cluster are added.
      <br/>
      This processes repeats until there are no pairs that have a document in common with the elements in the cluster.
      <br/>
      At this point, a new pair is selected from the remaining pairs to form a new cluster and the processes repeated until all pairs belong to a cluster.
      <br/>
      This clustering technique is referred to herein as the All-Pairs method.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Bibliograhic Coupling</p>
    <p num="29">
      Another well known technique for citation analysis is bibliographic coupling, e.g. see the text "INTRODUCTION TO INFORMETRICS Quantitative Methods in Library, Documentation and Information Science" by Leo Egge and Ronald Rousseau, Elsevier Science Publishers (1990).
      <br/>
      Bibliographic coupling is the inverse transformation of co-citation analysis.
      <br/>
      In bibliographic coupling, a document collection is analyzed to create document pairs and an indicator of the number of common documents that they both cite.
      <br/>
      Since bibliographic coupling is merely the inverse transformation of a co-citation matrix, the resulting analysis techniques described herein with respect to co-citation matrix, other than how to generate a co-citation matrix, would apply equally to bibliographic coupling.
      <br/>
      A technique for finding pairs and the number of documents they both cite is described below.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Bibliographic coupling has features that distinguish it from co-citation analysis.
      <br/>
      First, bibliographic coupling is more time invariant than co-citation analysis, i.e. once two documents are coupled, the coupling strength never changes until one of the document's hyperlink structure changes.
      <br/>
      The exact opposite occurs with co-citation analysis, since the co-citation/hyperlink strength of a pair of documents depends upon the number of documents that reference it, which changes as more documents are created that reference the pair.
      <br/>
      Thus, a bibliographic coupling analysis can be computed less frequently than a co-citation analysis.
      <br/>
      As applied to the Web, bibliographic coupling also reflects the state of field/area at the time the documents were created, providing interesting insights into the evolution of Web pages and ideas and Web sites.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      An exemplary process of bibliographic coupling on a set of documents is described with reference to the flowchart of FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 7, first document pairs are identified from the set, step 701.
      <br/>
      For each document pair, the number of documents which each are linked to by both documents is determined, step 702.
      <br/>
      The number of documents is an indication of the "strength" of the bibliographic coupling.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by generating a link index for each document and then comparing the index for each document.
      <br/>
      Recall that a link index is merely a list of links contained in a document.
      <br/>
      For web pages, links are identified by specific "tags" placed before them in mark-up language such as HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language) or XML (eXtensible Mark-up Language).
      <br/>
      Next, the strength values are normalized, step 703.
      <br/>
      This normalization takes in account the variations in the lengths of the reference lists for each document (i.e. the number of links to other documents).
      <br/>
      Finally, the strength values can be used as input for subsequent analysis, such clustering or relevance prediction, step 704.
      <br/>
      Such clustering and relevance prediction techniques described with respect to usage of co-citation lists would apply equally to bibliographic coupling strength information, perhaps with slight modifications.
      <br/>
      For example, in the aforementioned All-Pairs method of clustering, the clustering could be premised on each of the document pairs added to a cluster having a particular bibliographic coupling strength.
    </p>
    <p num="32">Application to the Web</p>
    <p num="33">
      It has been observed that the properties that fueled the development of citation and co-citation analysis are similar to those found between documents on the Web.
      <br/>
      The links found in Web pages, when employed in a non-random format, provide semantic linkages between objects, much in the same manner that citations link documents to other related documents.
      <br/>
      The resulting topology of a Web site reflects the organization of a community and its knowledge base, similar to the way in which citations in a scholarly paper reflect a scientific community's organization of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      It could be argued that links often serve as just navigational aids.
      <br/>
      This may be true for example for many of the links found on a "home page" for a particular Web locality.
      <br/>
      However, the role of hyperlinks for navigation may still be viewed as a hypothesis by the hypertext author(s) that the person interested in the current page will also be interested in browsing the linked pages.
      <br/>
      It has been determined that given the close resemblance of hyperlinks to citations, meaningful structures would emerge as the result of co-citation analysis on Web site.
    </p>
    <p num="35">An example of application of co-citation analysis as applied to the Web is found in a publication by Larson, Ray R., Bibliometrics of the World Wide Web: An Exploratory Analysis of the Intellectual Structure of Cyberspace, Proceedings of 59th ASIS Annual Meeting held in Baltimore Maryland, Vol. 33:71-78, Information Today Inc., 1996. In the publication Larson uses co-citation analysis to examine the "bibliometrics" of the Web so as to map its contents.</p>
    <p num="36">
      Generally speaking, the clustering of Web pages is useful in that it aids in the sense-making of large document collections, i.e. understanding its content and the relationship amongst the various documents.
      <br/>
      Further, clustering may be used as a real time aid in searching document collections using scatter-gather techniques.
      <br/>
      The clustering of the present invention may be used in any of these settings.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Method For Clustering Web Pages</p>
    <p num="38">
      The currently preferred embodiment of the present invention is implemented using software programs which inspect the mark-up language (e.g. HTML) representations of the documents.
      <br/>
      As would be known by one of ordinary skill in the art, links are identified by specific "tags" placed before them as defined by the mark-up language.
      <br/>
      Identification of links is thus accomplished by looking for the specific tags.
      <br/>
      In any event, the first step is to gather a document collection, step 201.
      <br/>
      This may be done by a specific query to the Web, using a document retrieval system such as Lycos (tm) , Excite (tm) , etc. or using a Web walker which automatically follows the links on a document and collects the linked documents.
      <br/>
      Or the document collection could be some randomly selected collection of documents.
      <br/>
      Or the document collection could be a particular Web site or set of Web sites or even the entire Web itself.
      <br/>
      Next, for each document, determine the frequency of linkage, i.e. the number of times it is linked to by another document in the collection, step 202.
      <br/>
      This may be accomplished by maintaining a table data structure having a document identifier field and link count field which is updated upon occurrence of a link to that document.
      <br/>
      This is done to get a relative sense of the "relatedness" of a document in the context of the particular document collection.
      <br/>
      Next, the documents are thresholded based on some specified minimum frequency of linkage, step 203 and the unused documents are discarded, step 204.
      <br/>
      This is essentially done as a matter of computational efficiency as documents below some minimum threshold are deemed "unrelated" to the other documents in the document collection.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that this threshold value should be established so as not to preclude relevant "young" documents that may not have many links to it at the time of analysis.
      <br/>
      A good threshold value yields the right number of clusters at the right size.
      <br/>
      It has been determined that a threshold value that is set too high causes a few clusters with a large number of documents and with many clusters with a small number of documents.
      <br/>
      If the threshold value is set too low, the result is fewer clusters with fewer documents in each.
      <br/>
      Note that preferably the threshold value can be changed by a user until the desired cluster characteristics are achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Next, a co-citation list of pairs of documents that are linked to by the same document is created, step 205.
      <br/>
      Each of the pairs of documents will also have a count of the number of times (the co-citation frequency) that they were both linked to by another document.
      <br/>
      The co-citation list may typically be generated and comprised of a table data structure having a first field identifying a co-citation pair and a second field having a count of the number of times that the co-citation pair were linked to by the same document.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      A suitable clustering operation is then performed on the co-citation list to generate co-citation clusters, step 206.
      <br/>
      Such suitable clustering operations are described in more detail below.
      <br/>
      The individual documents are then identified from the co-citation clusters and provided as a document cluster, step 207.
      <br/>
      This is performed since each document is typically referenced in multiple of the co-citation pairs.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      A first type of clustering utilizes a technique known as transitive closure.
      <br/>
      Transitive closure is generally related to identification of self-contained sets of node link structures, i.e. no node (document) has a link to another node (document) outside of the set.
      <br/>
      The clustering techniques using transitive closure can be generally described as follows:
      <br/>
      Given S=the set of all documents; V=the links contained in each document; G=&lt;S,V&gt;=the graph of nodes S and links V
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Step 1: Let Result=+ }
      <br/>
      Step 2: Pick a node i in S
      <br/>
      Step 3: Find the transitive closure of i in G-&gt;C(i)
      <br/>
      Step 4: Reset S&lt;-S-C(i) and Add C(l) to Result Set
      <br/>
      Step 5: Loop Steps 2-4 until S=+ }
      <br/>
      Step 6: Return Result Set
    </p>
    <p num="43">The step 3 may be accomplished using a transitive closure technique such as the well known Floyd-Warshall technique.</p>
    <p num="44">
      A transitive closure clustering method, referred to as the all-pairs method is described with reference to the flowchart of FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The objective of the all-pairs method is to place in a cluster all pairs having at least one common link.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 3, a first pair having a first page link reference (A) and a second page link reference (B) is selected, step 301.
      <br/>
      This represents a first cluster.
      <br/>
      Next, the list is scanned to find all pairs having a link reference to A or a link reference to B, step 302.
      <br/>
      Each of the pairs so identified is then identified as being in the first cluster, step 303.
      <br/>
      The steps 302-303 are repeated recursively for each of the co-citation pairs in the cluster until all pairs having a common link reference are included in the first cluster, step 304.
      <br/>
      The steps 301-304 are then repeated using the remaining pairs of the original co-citation list until all clusters have been identified, step 305.
      <br/>
      The "all-pairs" method of clustering is described in greater detail below with respect to FIG. 6.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      An alternative technique may use some form of statistical clustering.
      <br/>
      Such statistical clustering is generally described in the flowchart of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 4, first a distance or similarity matrix is computed, step 401.
      <br/>
      In the currently preferred embodiment, the Euclidean distance matrix on the log transformed co-citation frequencies is computed.
      <br/>
      However, other known methods that may be utilized include Manhattan, maximum, and binary distance metrics.
      <br/>
      One may also compute the correlation coefficients for each cell.
      <br/>
      In any event, the matrix is run through a suitable clustering algorithm, step 402.
      <br/>
      In the currently preferred embodiment, the Euclidean distance matrix is run through complete linkage clustering method to obtain clustering.
      <br/>
      However, other forms of clustering may be utilized.

      It should be noted that clustering techniques usually fall into one of two categories: hierarchical techniques (in particular agglomerative and divisive) and partitioning techniques.
      <br/>
      Agglomerative methods start with each element in a single cluster and successively merges the closest pairs.
      <br/>
      Common forms of this are Ward's clustering and hierarchical clustering.
      <br/>
      Divisive methods start with all the elements as one cluster and splits until each element is in a separate cluster.
      <br/>
      Two common forms of this are diana and mona.
      <br/>
      Partitioning methods divide the elements into a pre-defined number of clusters.
      <br/>
      A common form of this is called k-means.
      <br/>
      For a description of other suitable clustering techniques see the text entitled Finding Groups in Data An Introduction to Cluster Analysis, Leonard Kaufman, Peter J. Rousseeuw, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1990.

    <p num="47">Example of the Co-citation Analysis and Clustering of the Currently Preferred Embodiment</p>
    <p num="48">
      What follows is an example that illustrates the co-citation analysis of the present invention.
      <br/>
      It is assumed that each of the documents has met the threshold requirement of being "linked" to a minimum number of times.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 illustrates a plurality of documents 501-506 having defined links.
      <br/>
      As illustrated document A 501 has links 510-511, document B 502 has links 520-521, document C 503 has links 530-532, the document X 504 has links 540-541, document Y 505 has links 550-551 and document Z 506 has links 560-562.
      <br/>
      It can then be seen that the co-citation pairs from the respective documents are:
      <br/>
      document A 501: (C,D)
      <br/>
      document B 502: (C,D)
      <br/>
      document C 503: (A,B), (A,D), (B,D)
      <br/>
      document X 504: (Z,W)
      <br/>
      document Y F 505: (Z,W)
      <br/>
      document Z 506: (X,Y), (X,W), (Y,W)
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The co-citation list and associated frequency then becomes:
      <br/>
      (C,D):2, (A,D):1, (A,B):1, (B,D):1, (Z,W):2, (X,Y):1, (X,W):1, (Y,W):1
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      FIGS. 6a-6f illustrates use of the "all-pairs" method for clustering the co-citation list.
      <br/>
      Note that the co-citation method does not utilize the frequency of the co-citation.
      <br/>
      That is typically used in statistical clustering techniques.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 6a, a list 610 and cluster 1620 are illustrated.
      <br/>
      The elements 601-607 in the list 610 are the elements in the co-citation list generated with respect to the example of FIG. 5, except for the list pair 600 which is used as the randomly selected initial pairing for cluster 1620.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Referring to FIG. 6b, added to cluster 1620 are the co-citation pairs from the list which have either a C or D in them.
      <br/>
      So as illustrated the pairs 601 and 603 have been added to cluster 1 and removed from the list 610.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Referring now to FIG. 6c, as a result of the addition of co-citation pair 601 to cluster 1, any co-citation pair having an A is added to the cluster.
      <br/>
      This results in the co-citation pair 600 being added to cluster 1620.
      <br/>
      Note that as a result of the addition to cluster 1 of co-citation pair 603, the list would be inspected for any pair having a B. But since no pair in the list 610 contains a B, illustration of such a step has been omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Referring now to FIG. 6d, a cluster 2630 is now being formed.
      <br/>
      This is illustrated by addition of pair 604 to cluster 2630.
      <br/>
      Referring now to FIG. 6e, the pairs 606 and 607 have been added to cluster 2630 as a result of the each having a link to W. Finally, referring to FIG. 6f, the pair 605 is added to the cluster 2630 as a result of having a link to Y.

      Most current Web browsers provide very little support for helping people gain an overall assessment of the structure and content of large collections of Web pages.

      Information Visualization could be used to provide an interactive overview of web localities that facilitates navigation and general assessment.
      <br/>
      Visualizations have been developed that provide new interactive mechanisms for making sense of information sets with thousands of objects.

      <br/>
      Visualizations can be applied to the Web by treating the pages of the Web as objects with properties.

      Each of these visualizations provide an overview of a Web site in terms of some simple property of the pages.

    <p num="61">Spreading Activation</p>
    <p num="62">
      An activation network can be represented as a graph defined by matrix R, where each off-diagonal element Ri,j contains the strength of association between nodes i and j, and the diagonal contains zeros.
      <br/>
      The strengths determine how much activation flows from node to node.
      <br/>
      The set of source nodes of activation being pumped into the network is represented by a vector C, where Ci represents the activation pumped in by node i. The dynamics of activation can be modeled over discrete steps t=1, 2, . . . N, with activation at step t represented by a vector A(t), with element A(t, i) representing the activation at node i at step t. The time evolution of the flow of activation is determined by
      <br/>
      A(t)=C+M A(t-1)  Equation 1
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      where M is a matrix that determines the flow and decay of activation among nodes.
      <br/>
      It is specified by
      <br/>
      M=(1-g)I+a R,  Equation 2
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      where g&lt;1 is a parameter determining the relaxation of node activity back to zero when it receives no additional activation input, and a is a parameter denoting the amount of activation spread from a node to its neighbors.
      <br/>
      I is the identity matrix.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      As indicated above, a decay function is a critical analytical component of the spreading activation used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      A decay function, such as the one described in U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/535,616, is used to generate decay values for dampening activation through a network.
      <br/>
      This decay function is referred to as "the law of surfing" and is an indication of the likelihood that a user will "click-on" or traverse to another document in a document collection.
      <br/>
      In any event, depending on the nature of the decay function, activation values are assumed to be the predicted relevance to the input focus (or the probability that a page will be needed given the pages in the input focus).
    </p>
    <p num="66">Networks for Spreading Activation</p>
    <p num="67">
      As noted above, a network is used to represent strength of associations among linked documents as reflected by some predetermined criteria.
      <br/>
      The network or graph is represented by matrices in the spreading activation equation.
      <br/>
      That is, each row corresponds to a network node representing a Web page, and similarly each column corresponds to a network node representing a Web page.
      <br/>
      If we index the 1,2, . . . , N Web pages, there would be i=1,2, . . . N columns and j=1,2, . . . N rows for each matrix representing a graph network.
      <br/>
      Here, the criteria would be based on the citation structure and network would embody a generated co-citation matrix.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Each entry in the ith column and jth row of a matrix represents the strength of connection between page i and page j (or similarly, the amount of potential activation flow or capacity).
      <br/>
      As described above, the meaning of these entries varies depending on the type of network through which activation is being spread.
      <br/>
      In the currently preferred embodiment, the entry values represent citation frequencies between pages.
    </p>
    <p num="69">The Result of Spreading Activation</p>
    <p num="70">
      Spreading activation across a network and finding related pages is described conceptually with reference to FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 8, activation 801 is pumped into one or more of the graph networks 802 at nodes representing some starting set of focus Web pages.
      <br/>
      The activation flows through the arcs of the graph structure, with the amount of flow modulated by the arc strengths (which might also be thought of as arc flow capacities) and dampened by the probability values provided by the decay function (e.g. the law of surfing).
      <br/>
      The asymptotic pattern of activation over nodes, as illustrated by bars 804 contained in the nodes at activated network 803, will define a number of hits of other Web pages relative to the starting set of focus Web pages.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Utilizing citation analysis in combination with spreading activation is described with respect to the flowchart of FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      First, a collection of documents is identified or otherwise obtained, step 901.
      <br/>
      This may be as a result of a search, crawl or search.
      <br/>
      Generally, these documents have some relationship.
      <br/>
      Next, citation information is generated from the collection of documents, step 902.
      <br/>
      This can be performed using the steps described above with respect to generation of a co-citation pairs or bibliographic coupled pairs.
      <br/>
      The citation information is then used to create a citation matrix, which will embody the association matrix, step 903.
      <br/>
      Creation of the citation matrix is a straightforward task of creating a matrix with the pages on each axis and the matrix entries representing the co-citation frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      An initialization matrix is then created, step 904.
      <br/>
      The initialization matrix represents the initial focus set of pages at which activation will be started.
      <br/>
      This focus set of pages may be obtained in various ways such as a current page being viewed, a history of pages of viewed or the results of a search.
      <br/>
      Spreading activation is then performed using a suitable spreading activation technique, step 905.
      <br/>
      The spreading activation utilizes the above generated initial activation matrix, citation matrix and a decay function.
      <br/>
      Activation information relating to the documents in the collection is extracted when a stable pattern of activation across all nodes (i.e. web pages) is settled into, step 906.
      <br/>
      Relationships may then be determined based on the measured level of activation, step 907.
      <br/>
      For example, the documents with the highest levels of activation can be identified as related.

      The computer based system on which the currently preferred embodiment of the present invention may be implemented is described with reference to FIG. 10. As noted above, the present invention is implemented using software programming instructions for execution on a computer based system.
      <br/>
      The computer based system and associated operating instructions (e.g. software) embody circuitry used to implement the present invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 10, the computer based system is comprised of a plurality of components coupled via a bus 1001.
      <br/>
      The bus 1001 may consist of a plurality of parallel buses (e.g. address, data and status buses) as well as a hierarchy of buses (e.g. a processor bus, a local bus and an I/O bus).
      <br/>
      In any event, the computer system is further comprised of a processor 1002 for executing instructions provided via bus 1001 from Internal memory 1003 (note that the Internal memory 1003 is typically a combination of Random Access and Read Only Memories).
      <br/>
      The processor 1002 will be used to perform various operations in support extracting raw data from Web site, converting the raw data into the desired feature vectors and topology, usage path and text similarity matrices, categorization and spreading activation.
      <br/>
      Instructions for performing such operations are retrieved from Internal memory 1003.
      <br/>
      Such operations that would be performed by the processor 1002 would include the processing steps described in the flowcharts of FIGS. 2-4, 7 and 8 and the accompanying descriptions.
      <br/>
      The operations would typically be provided in the form of coded instructions in a suitable programming language using well-known programming techniques.
      <br/>
      The processor 1002 and Internal memory 1003 may be discrete components or a single integrated device such as an Application Specification Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chip.

    <p num="75">
      Also coupled to the bus 1001 are a keyboard 1004 for entering alphanumeric input, external storage 1005 for storing data, a cursor control device 1006 for manipulating a cursor, a display 1007 for displaying visual output and a network connection 1008.
      <br/>
      The keyboard 1004 would typically be a standard QWERTY keyboard but may also be telephone like keypad.
      <br/>
      The external storage 1005 may be fixed or removable magnetic or optical disk drive.
      <br/>
      The cursor control device 1006, e.g. a mouse or trackball, will typically have a button or switch associated with it to which the performance of certain functions can be programmed.
      <br/>
      The network connection 1008 provides means for attaching to a network, e.g. a Local Area Network (LAN) card or modem card with appropriate software.
      <br/>
      The network ultimately attached to is the Internet, but it may be through proxy servers or intermediary networks or dial-up services such as America On-Line.RTM., Prodigy.RTM. or CompuServe.RTM..
