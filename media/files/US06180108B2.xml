    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This invention relates generally to the production of biologically active proteins from genetically engineered mammalian cell lines.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the invention is concerned with a novel expression vector containing an Epstein-Barr virus terminal repeat sequence which enhances integration of expression vectors into the genomic DNA in host mammalian cell lines.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Background</p>
    <p num="5">Many attempts have been made to increase the stable integration efficiency of expression vectors into genomic DNA by site specific integration.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Random, nonhomologous integration of input DNA into the host cell genome occurs more than 100 times more frequently than targeted homologous recombination (Thomas et al., 1987, Cell 51: 503-512).
      <br/>
      However, homologous recombination using hotspot, e.g. hypervariable minisatellite DNA, was shown to occur more frequently than random recombination between two defective plasmids in mammalian cells (Wahls et al., 1990, Cell 60: 95-103).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Autoantigenic cellular protein was isolated by Sun et al. (1994, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91: 8646-8650).
      <br/>
      This protein was identified as terminal repeat binding protein, or TRBP.
      <br/>
      Two terminal repeat binding sites (TRBS1 and TRBS2) for terminal repeat binding protein were also identified by Sun et al.
      <br/>
      They observed that TRBP binds sequences present in repetitive cellular DNA, e.g. variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR) and immunoglobulin heavy chain class switch regions.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The terminal repeat binding protein binds to G-rich regions of terminal repeats of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV-TR).
      <br/>
      EBV-TR takes part in processing and packaging of virion DNA (Zimmermann et al., 1995, J Virol 69: 3147-3155).
      <br/>
      The EBV-TRs are involved in the integration into chromosomal DNA (Matsuo et al., 1984, Science 226: 1322-1325) and in the circularization event of the genome after infection.
      <br/>
      These sequences are the essential elements for cleavage and packaging of the EBV virion DNA (Hammerschmidt et al., 1989, Nature (London) 340: 393-397; Zimmermann et al.
      <br/>
      J Virol, 1995, 69: 3147-3155).
      <br/>
      These data indicate the important role of the EBV-TR sequence in the recombination events.
      <br/>
      Therefore, we tested EBV-TR for integration events in deriving clones from the transfected cells.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      We have now discovered that cells transfected with an expression vector containing a selectable marker and an EBV-TR sequence show a five to ten fold increase in the number of cells resistant to the selection agent as compared to cells transfected with the same expression vector without an EBV-TR sequence under the same selection conditions.
      <br/>
      The higher survival ratios under drug selection indicate that the vectors with EBV-TR may enhance the integration frequency of vectors into genomic DNA.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The expression vectors of this invention include an EBV-TR sequence and a selectable marker, such as dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr).
      <br/>
      The preferred EBV-TR sequence is a 402 bp sequence (given in FIG. 1) which includes the core part of the TRBP-binding region from an immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line 6F 11.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the mammalian gene expression vector comprises a CMV enhancer and promoter, an intronic sequence (MIS, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,021 to Cho et al.) derived from Epstein-Barr virus, a unique restriction enzyme site Hpal to allow for insertion of a protein coding sequence, and a poly A region plus the plasmid backbone with a drug selection marker and the EBV-TR sequence indicated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      This vector is denoted pSH131 (see FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      This vector is used to introduce the appropriate DNA coding sequence of the protein of interest into mammalian cells to stabilize the protein expression in a long term culture in a serum-free medium.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, the sequence for an IL-4 mutein was cloned into pSH131 and the resulting vector is pSH135.
      <br/>
      The EBV-TR sequence was also directly linked to pCIS25D (vector for expressing B-domain deleted rFVIII, designated BDD-FVIII) and resulting vector is pCIS25DTR.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      A preferred amplifiable marker is dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) although other markers such as glutamine synthetase (gs) and multidrug-resistance gene (mdr) can be substituted.
      <br/>
      These amplifiable markers (dhfr, gs, and mdr) are also selectable markers.
      <br/>
      A preferred selectable marker is neo (aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, for neomycin resistance); still other preferred markers such as hph (hygromycin B phosphotransferase) and hisD (histidinol dehydroganase) can be substituted.

    <p num="12">
      The cell host to be transfected can be any mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      Cell lines that are known to accept the integration of selection genes into their chromosomal DNA are optimal; for example, human embryonic kidney cells (e.g. 293S cells), human hybrid of 293S and B-cell origin (e.g. HKB11; ATCC deposit no. CRL 12568, see U.S. Patent application to Cho designated MSB-7241, "Human hybrid host cell for mammalian gene expression," filed on the same day as the current application and incorporated herein by reference), chinese hamster ovary (CHO), baby hamster kidney (BHK-21), mouse myeloma, and human B-cells.
    </p>
    <p num="13">As one working example, we show that CHO (dhfr-) cells transfected with an expression vector containing dhfr and an EBV-TR sequence showed about a five to ten fold increase in the number of methotrexate (MTX) resistant cells as compared to cells transfected with the same expression vector without EBV-TR under the same selection conditions.</p>

    <heading>SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="16">Construction of expression vectors containing EBV-TR</p>
    <p num="17">
      A 381 bp fragment of the EBV-TR sequence described in FIG. 1, encompassing DNA sequence from 170,476 to 170,856 of B95/8 EBV sequencing data (P. J. Farrell, "Epstein-Barr Virus Genome," in Advanced Viral Oncology; edited by G. Klein; Ravens Press, Ltd.: New York 1989, pp 103-132) was made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a template DNA prepared from 6F11 cells (ATCC CRL9562) a lymphoblastoid cell line which was immortalized by EBV.
      <br/>
      Two primers (5'-GGCAATGGAGCGTGACGAAG-3' and 5'-CTCATCACGGTCACGCATGG-3', fragments derived from SEQ ID:1) were made to amplify the 381 bp fragment of the EBV-TR sequence in 6F11 cell DNA.
      <br/>
      The PCR products were phosphorylated and linked to the expression vector pSM97 after removing a 553 bp fragment excised by the restriction endonuclease Nael.
      <br/>
      The resulting vector was pSH131 (FIG. 2), which has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, ATCC 98879.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      DNA sequencing data of the EVB-TR sequence in pSH131 (402 bp) was larger than the expected size (381 bp).
      <br/>
      The main difference is a repeat of 11-bp (GGCGGGTCATG) consisting of 4 bp from a 9 bp element (GTGTTGGCG)and 7 bp from a 10 bp element (GGTCATGGGG).
      <br/>
      Both ends of EBV DNA molecule in EBV-TR described by Zimmermann et al. (1996, J Virol 69: 3147-3155) consists of a 9 bp element (GTGTTGGCG) and a 11 bp element (GGGTCATGGGG) (all fragments derived from SEQ ID NO: 1).
      <br/>
      The 11 bp element in pSH131 lacked 1 bp; thus we observed only 10 bp.
      <br/>
      The reason for the observed repeat of the 11 bp element might be that the EBV-TR sequence in pSH131 (402 bp) was made using 6F11 DNA, not B95/8 DNA. 6F 11 cells are immortalized by an EBV and have a concatenated form of EBV-DNA (Cho and Tran, 1993, Virology 194: 838-842), while B95/8 EBV is an infecting virus.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the EBV-TR sequence in pSH131 (402 bp) was derived from this concatenated EVB-DNA.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A sequence of DNA coding for an IL-4 double mutein (IL-4dm) was inserted into the Hpal site of pSM97 and pSH131.
      <br/>
      The resulting plasmids are pSH134 (IL-4dm in pSM97) and pSH135 (IL-4dm in pSH13 1).
      <br/>
      The IL-4dm that was used is as essentially described in Eur.
      <br/>
      Pat. 0613499B1 to Sebald, incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      This IL-4dm is a derivative of the unmodified IL-4 having the amino acids at position 121 (arginine) and 124 (tyrosine) changed to aspartic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The PCR product of the EBV-TR sequence was also inserted into the SalI site of pCIS25D, which is an expression vector coding for B-domain deleted factor VIII (BDD-FVIII).
      <br/>
      The resulting plasmid is pCIS25DTR.
      <br/>
      All four expression vectors, pSH134 and pSH135, pCIS25D, and pCIS25DTR, have the same functional dhfr gene.
      <br/>
      See FIG. 2 for the maps.

    <p num="21">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="22">Effect of EBV-TR on the expression of a reporter gene in transient transfection assays</p>
    <p num="23">
      Two million CHO (dhfr-negative) and HKB (a human-human hybrid cell line; ATCC CRL-12568) cells were separately transfected with 5 ug of plasmid DNA (pSH134 and pSH135) in a 6-well plate using cationic liposome DMRIE-C reagent (Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.) according to the protocol provided.
      <br/>
      Two or three days after transfection of CHO and HKB cells with both expression vectors, the supernatants were tested for expression of the IL-4dm by an ELISA.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, expression levels of IL-4dm from pSH134 were very similar with those from pSH135 from two different transfectants in repeated transient transfection assays.
      <br/>
      These results show that EBV-TR has no effects on the expression of the IL-4dm reporter gene.
      <br/>
      These results indicate that EBV-TR might not have any enhancing function on the gene expression in the vectors, e.g. dhfr.
      <br/>
      This implies that the presence of the EBV-TR increases survival ratios through a mechanism other than the increased expression level of dhfr gene, i.e. the mechanism may involve increased integration of the vector.

      Two weeks after seeding the cells in selection medium, pSH135 (with EBV-TR) transfected cells showed an approximately 10 fold higher selection ratio than those transfected with pSH134 (without EBV-TR), although EBV-TR showed no enhancing function on IL-4 expression (FIG. 3).

    <p num="31">
      CHO (dhfr-negative) cells transfected with pSH135 were plated onto 96-well plates (5 * 105 cells per plate) using a serum-free selection medium supplemented with transferrin, recombinant insulin, and methotrexate (50 nM).
      <br/>
      The selection medium lacks hypoxanthine and thymidine.

      After three months of amplification (50 and 100 nM MTX), one of the intitial populations, denoted 1G9, was adapted to suspension culture using a shake flask.

    <p num="32">EXAMPLE 4</p>
    <p num="33">Stable integration</p>
    <p num="34">
      One of the CHO clones secreting BDD-FVIII, which was derived from pCIS25DTR transfected CHO cells as described in Example 2, was tested for its production stability under the absence of the selection drug (MTX).
      <br/>
      This clone continued to secrete BDD-FVIII during a six month period of growth in a medium lacking MTX.
      <br/>
      All single cell clones derived from this clone were also secretion positive.
      <br/>
      These results indicate that the integration of the vectors containing an EBV-TR sequence is a stable integration.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Conclusion</p>
    <p num="36">
      The derivation of stable cell lines which secrete high levels of proteins is a very tedious and labor-intensive task.
      <br/>
      This is at least partially due to the low chance of stable integration and amplification of the gene of interest.
      <br/>
      Large numbers of drug resistant clones generally need to be screened to obtain high secreting clones.
      <br/>
      Therefore, we have described here that vectors having an EBV-TR sequence result in an enhanced drug selection ratio, indicating a high integration ratio of transferred genes.
      <br/>
      As shown in Table 1, it was possible to select and to amplify transfected cells even under serum-free conditions.
