    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to coating compositions having latent amine functional compounds, and particularly to such compositions having cyclic carbonate compounds.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Thermosetting, or curable, coating compositions are widely used in coatings operations.
      <br/>
      In automotive coatings, in particular, thermoset coatings provide durable finishes.
      <br/>
      Automotive coatings include primers and topcoats, which may be single layer enamels or two layer basecoat/clearcoat systems.
      <br/>
      The primer may be applied either as a first coating layer or over another layer, for example over an electrocoat primer layer.
      <br/>
      The topcoat is then usually applied directly over the primer layer.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      While thermosetting compositions provide desirable coating properties, there are a number of concerns that arise with thermosetting coating compositions.
      <br/>
      One consideration is the curing conditions needed to achieve sufficient crosslinking of the film.
      <br/>
      In general, higher temperatures and longer times at the curing temperature increase the manufacturing costs of the coated article.
      <br/>
      Another concern in some cases is that undesirable by-products of the curing reaction are generated.
      <br/>
      For example, blocked curing agents release the blocking agents as volatile organic compounds that constitute emissions regulated by various government rules.
      <br/>
      It is also important that the crosslinks that are formed are suitable for providing long life to the coating under the particular conditions to which the coated article will be exposed.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Different crosslinking mechanisms may be employed in thermosetting coatings.
      <br/>
      One curing mechanism utilizes a melamine formaldehyde resin curing agent in the coating composition to react with hydroxyl groups on the resin.
      <br/>
      This curing method provides good cure at relatively low temperatures (e.g., 250 (degree)  F. with a blocked acid catalyst, or even lower with an unblocked acid catalyst), but the crosslink bonds contain undesirable ether linkages and the resulting coatings may provide poor overall durability under certain service conditions.
      <br/>
      In an alternative curing method, polyisocyanate curing agents may be reacted with amine or hydroxyl groups on the resin.
      <br/>
      This curing method provides desirable urea or urethane crosslink bonds, but it also has several disadvantages.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent premature gelation of the coating composition, the polyisocyanate must either be kept separate from the resin in what is known in the art as a two-package or two-pack coating system or else the highly reactive isocyanate groups on the curing agent must be blocked (e.g., with an oxime or alcohol).
      <br/>
      Blocked polyisocyanates, however, require high temperatures (e.g., 150 (degree)  C. or more) to unblock and begin the curing reaction.
      <br/>
      The volatile blocking agents released during cure can adversely affect coating properties, as well as increasing the volatile organic content for the composition.
    </p>
    <p num="5">There is thus a need in the art for coating compositions that could provide desirable urethane crosslink linkages, but avoid the problems that accompany the use of polyisocyanate curing agents.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Coating compositions comprising carbonate curing agents and primary amine-functional crosslinkable resins have been proposed for electrocoat primers in December et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,431,791. In the electrocoat bath, the primary amine groups are salted and rendered unreactive with the carbonate groups of the carbonate compound.
      <br/>
      When the coating is deposited onto the conductive substrate, the primary amine groups are regenerated from the salt and are once more reactive toward the carbonate curing agent.
      <br/>
      This method of achieving package stability, however, is unsuitable for solventborne and non-cathodic waterborne compositions.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      We have now invented a coating composition capable of forming durable urethane linkages upon curing of the coating without the attendant problems of polyisocyanate curing agents.
      <br/>
      The compositions of the present invention comprise a compound having a plurality of latent primary amine groups and a compound having a plurality of cyclic carbonate groups.
      <br/>
      The present invention further provides a method of coating a substrate by applying a coating composition comprising a resin having latent primary amine functionality and a carbonate compound having a plurality of cyclic carbonate groups and then curing the applied composition.
      <br/>
      The present invention also provides a substrate having thereon a coating derived from a composition containing a compound having latent primary amine functionality and a carbonate compound having a plurality of cyclic carbonate groups.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The compositions of the invention include a compound having latent primary amine functionality and a compound with a plurality of cyclic carbonate groups.
      <br/>
      The compound having latent amine functionality may be formed by reacting two moles of a cyclic anhydride of a polycarboxylic acid with two moles of a compound having at least two primary amine groups.
      <br/>
      The compound having a plurality of cyclic carbonate groups has at least two carbonate groups, and preferably has more than two carbonate groups on average per molecule.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the synthesis of the compound with latent primary amine functionality, an amine compound with preferably two primary amine groups is employed.
      <br/>
      The amine compound may optionally have additional functional groups that are not primary amine groups, so long as such groups do not interfere with the reaction between the primary amine groups of the amine compound and the cyclic anhydride.
      <br/>
      Suitable examples of the primary amine compounds include, without limitation,  ALPHA , OMEGA -alkylenediamines and polyalkylene polyamines.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable polyalkylene polyamines include, without limitation, ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, dipropylenetriamine, 1,6-diaminohexane, 1,3-diaminopropane, methyl imino-bis(propylamine), 1,4-diaminobutane, and mixtures of these.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred among these are ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, dipropylenetriamine, and mixtures of these compounds.
      <br/>
      Preferred polyamines have molecular weights in the range of about 60 to about 400, more preferably from about 60 to about 250, and still more preferably from about 60 to about 160.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Suitable examples of cyclic anhydrides of polycarboxylic acids that may be used in the reaction with the primary amine compound include, without limitation, phthalic anhydride and substituted derivatives of phthalic anhydride such as 4-sulfophthalic anhydride, 4-methylphthalic anhydride, 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride, nitrophthalic anhydride, and 4,4'-carbonyldiphthalic anhydride; hydrogenated derivatives of phthalic acid such as hexahydrophthalic anhydride, 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, hexahydro-4-methylphthalic anhydride, and methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride; maleic anhydride and its derivatives, such as 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride, 2,3-diphenylmaleic anhydride, bromomaleic anhydride, and dichloromaleic anhydride; pyromellitic dianhydride; succinic anhydride and its derivatives, such as dodecenylsuccinic anhydride, and methylsuccinic anhydride; 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, nadic methyl anhydride (methyl-5-norborene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride), cis-5-norborene-endo-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, 2,3-pyridinedicarboxylic anhydride, pyromellitic dianhydride, endo-bicyclo�2.2.2�oct-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride, 1,2,3,4,-cyclobutanetetracarboxylic dianhydride, and 1-cyclopentene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride.
      <br/>
      Preferred among these are phthalic anhydride and substituted derivatives of phthalic anhydride and hydrogenated derivatives of phthalic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The reaction between the cyclic anhydride and the amine compound is may be carried out with about a stoichiometric ratio of the reactants, but preferably is carried out using an excess of the amine compound.
      <br/>
      It is preferred to employ a ratio of at least about two moles, and preferably at least about three moles, of the primary amine compound per mole of the anhydride.
      <br/>
      In a particularly preferred embodiment, a ratio of about four moles of the primary amine compound is used per mole of the anhydride.
      <br/>
      For example, it is preferred to use a ratio of about four moles of diethylenetriamine to about one mole of phthalic anhydride.
      <br/>
      The excess amine compound is removed, for example by vacuum distillation, following completion of the reaction.
      <br/>
      For reasons that the person of skill in the art will appreciate, the ratio of moles of primary amine compound to anhydride should not be too high, and it is preferred that the ratio not exceed about eight moles, and preferably about six moles, of primary amine compound per mole of the anhydride.
      <br/>
      The product of the excess amine compound procedure is found to have a low concentration of, or to be free of, residual carboxylic acid groups.
      <br/>
      This is thought to indicate that the cyclic tetramide is preferentially formed over a linear product.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The reaction product of the amine compound and the cyclic anhydride may have a polydispersity of about 20, but lower polydispersities are preferred.
      <br/>
      The polydispersity is preferably less than about 5, and even more preferably less than about 3.
      <br/>
      The reaction product of the amine compound and the cyclic anhydride more preferably has a polydispersity of about 2 or less, and even more preferably about 1.1 or less.
      <br/>
      Reaction products that have a polydispersity of about 1.05 or less are particularly preferred.
      <br/>
      The reaction product has at least two latent primary amine per molecule on average.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The crosslinkable resin of the invention has latent amine functionality that may be represented by the structure (I):  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="14">
      in which L1 is a bivalent linking group in which the bonding valences, connecting to the carbon of the amide carbonyl, are on two adjacent carbon atoms and in which L2 is a linking group with terminal carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The adjacent, bonding carbon atoms of L1 may be bonded to one another with a single bond (as for the product prepared using hexahydrophthalic anhydride), a double bond (as for the product prepared using maleic anhydride), or an aromatic bond (as for the product prepared using phthalic anhydride).
      <br/>
      Either or both of the adjacent bonding carbon atoms may carry a substituent or the adjacent bonding carbon atoms may be members of an aliphatic or aromatic ring, wherein the ring may itself be substituted at any available carbon atom.
      <br/>
      Thus, L1 may have the various structures  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      wherein R1 through R10 may independently be selected from hydrogen; halides; alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl groups, including derivatives of these such as halogenated and sulfonated derivatives; or two R groups may together form a cyclic structure.
      <br/>
      L2 is preferably an arylene, alkylene, or N,N'-dialkyleneamine group, with the alkylene groups having preferably about eight or fewer carbon atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The compositions of the invention further include at least one compound having a plurality of carbonate groups.
      <br/>
      The carbonate compound may comprise cyclic carbonate groups having various ring sizes as are known in the art, such as five-member cyclic carbonate rings, six-member cyclic carbonate rings, seven-member cyclic carbonate rings, or fused ring systems containing the characteristic --O--CO--O-- carbonate moiety.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Cyclic carbonate compounds may be synthesized by any of several different approaches.
      <br/>
      One approach involves reacting an epoxy group-containing compound with CO2, preferably under pressure with a catalyst.
      <br/>
      Useful catalysts include any that activate an oxirane ring, such as tertiary amine quaternary salts (e.g., tetramethyl ammonium bromide), tin and/or phosphorous complex salts (e.g., (CH3)3 SnI, (CH3)4 PI) . Epoxides can also be reacted with  BETA -butyrolactone in the presence of such catalysts.
      <br/>
      In another approach, a glycol, such as glycerin, may be reacted at temperatures of at least about 80 (degree)  C. (usually under reflux) with diethyl carbonate in the presence of a catalyst (e.g., potassium carbonate) to form a cyclic carbonate.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a functional compound containing a ketal of a 1,2-diol having the structure:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      can be ring-opened with water at temperatures of at least 60 (degree)  C., preferably with a trace amount of acid, to form a 1,2-glycol.
      <br/>
      As an alternative to reaction with diethyl carbonate, glycols can be reacted with phosgene in the presence of sodium hydroxide to form a cyclic carbonate.
      <br/>
      Five-member cyclic carbonate rings can be formed from 1,2-glycols.
      <br/>
      Six-member cyclic carbonate rings can be formed from 1,3-glycols.
      <br/>
      Fused rings may be formed, for example, by the reaction of phenol with phosgene to form phenylene carbonate.
      <br/>
      Cyclic carbonates typically have 5-6-member rings.
      <br/>
      Five-member rings are preferred, due to their ease of synthesis and to a greater degree of commercial availability.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In a preferred embodiment, compounds useful as the carbonate compound are prepared by reaction of a polyepoxide with carbon dioxide to convert the epoxy groups to cyclic carbonate groups.
      <br/>
      Polyepoxides useful for preparing the carbonate compounds include monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric polyepoxide materials.
      <br/>
      Among preferred compounds for synthesis of the carbonate compounds of the invention are glycidyl ethers of polyols and glycidyl esters of polyacids.
      <br/>
      The polyepoxides can be reacted with carbon dioxide, as described above, to form the cyclic carbonate compound.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The polyepoxide compound may be any aliphatic or aromatic compound having at least two epoxide groups per molecule on average, and it is preferred to employ compounds that have from about 2 to about 4 epoxide groups per molecule on average.
      <br/>
      Examples of useful polyepoxide compounds include, without limitation, polyglycidyl ethers and esters, epoxy novolac resins, and epoxide-functional acrylics.
      <br/>
      In particular, the polyepoxide compound may be the polyglycidyl ether of aliphatic or aromatic polyols such as 1,4-butanediol, neopentyl glycol, cyclohexane dimethanol, diethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, trimethylolpropane, trimethylolethane, glycerol, bisphenol A (4,4'-isopropylidenediphenol), hydroquinone, 4,4'-biphenol, 2,2'-biphenol, 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone, 1,5-dihydroxynaphthylene, novolac polyphenols, resorcinol, and similar compounds.
      <br/>
      In principle, the glycidyl ether of any polyol can be used.
      <br/>
      The polyepoxide compound is preferably a polyglycidyl ether of a polyphenol, and particularly preferably, it is the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A. The polyepoxide compound could also be extended, for example by reaction of the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A with a polyphenol such as bisphenol or with a polyamine such as those sold by BASF AG of Germany under the tradename POLYAMIN and under the tradename Jeffamine.RTM. by Huntsman Co. of Houston, Tex.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The novolac epoxy resin may be epoxy phenol novolac resins or epoxy cresol novolac resins having the formula I:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="22">
      in which R1 is H or methyl, R2 may be H or a glycidyl group, with the proviso that on average at least two R2 groups per molecule are glycidyl groups and preferably from two to four R2 groups per molecule are glycidyl groups, and n is from 0 to 12, preferably from 1 to 6, and more preferably from 1 to 2.
      <br/>
      The novolac resin may also be an aromatic novolac bisphenol A resin, having either the formula II  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="23">or the formula III  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="24">
      wherein, for each formula, R2 may be H or a glycidyl group, with the proviso that on average at least two R2 groups per molecule are glycidyl groups, and m is from 0 to 4, preferably from 0 to 2.
      <br/>
      Although not all of the oxirane groups of the novolac resin must be converted to carbonate groups, it is preferred that all of the oxirane groups are converted to carbonate groups.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Polyglycidyl esters of polyacids are also useful in the present invention.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the polyglycidyl ester is the ester of a compound having two to about four carboxylic acid groups.
      <br/>
      Such esters include, without limitation, the diglycidyl esters of terephthalic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, 2,6-naphthylene dicarboxylic acid, and oxalic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The range of useful epoxide equivalent weights for the polyepoxide compounds is broad, but in general it is preferred that the epoxide equivalent weight should be chosen to yield a sufficient crosslink density on curing to make a film that is strong and durable.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, the epoxide equivalent weight is from about 50 to about 500.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Other compounds having higher carbonate functionality may be obtained, for example, by reacting one mole of a diisocyanate such as isophorone diisocyanate with two moles of a polyol such as trimethylol propane to produce a tetrafunctional alcohol, which can be epoxidized with an epihalohydrin to produce a tetrafunctional polyepoxide.
      <br/>
      The tetrafunctional polyepoxide can in turn be reacted with carbon dioxide to form a tetrafunctional cyclic carbonate.
      <br/>
      Other higher-functionality polyepoxides, e.g., tetrakis(4-glycidyloxy-phenyl)ethane or the epoxide-functional novolac epoxies, may also be reacted with CO2 to form poly-cyclic carbonates.
      <br/>
      Even substantially higher functionalities can be used, such as polymeric polyepoxides (e.g., epoxide-functional acrylic resins) converted to polymeric cyclic carbonate compounds, for which the functionality will be a function of the equivalent weight of the polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      One preferred class of cyclic carbonate compounds useful as the carbonate compound of the invention are compounds having an average of at least about four cyclic carbonate groups.
      <br/>
      In another preferred embodiment, each cyclic carbonate group is appended to an ether segment, for example a segment having at least one unit of propylene oxide.
      <br/>
      Such cyclic carbonate compounds may be prepared by reacting a polyether polyol with an epihalohydrin to convert the hydroxyl groups to epoxy groups.
      <br/>
      The polyether polyols may be based upon simple polyols having three or four hydroxyl groups, or mixtures of such compounds.
      <br/>
      Illustrative examples include, without limitation, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, 1,2,6-trihydroxyhexane, xylose, adonitol, and so on.
      <br/>
      The epoxy groups may then be converted to cyclic carbonate groups by reaction with CO2.

      Usually, the coating will be cured at a temperature of at least about 80 (degree)  C., preferably at least about 100 (degree)  C., and particularly preferably at least about 120 (degree)  C. The curing time will vary depending on the particular components used, and physical parameters such as the thickness of the layers, however, typical curing times range from 15 to 60 minutes.
      <br/>
      Unlike curing of systems with blocked isocyanate carbonate compounds or with alkylated melamine resins, the curing chemistry of the present invention does not involve release of a volatile organic by-product.
      <br/>
      Thus, the inventive compositions offer the significant advantages of producing lower emissions and of providing a higher conversion of paint solids into cured coating.

    <p num="38">
      The coating preparations according to the invention may be used to coat various kinds of substrates using any of a number of processes known to those skilled in the art, such as spraying, roll coating, and coil coating methods and so on.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the substrate is a plastic or metallic substrate.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the substrate is an automotive component such as a body panel.
      <br/>
      The compositions of the invention are preferably employed as exterior automotive coatings.
      <br/>
      The substrate may have one or more layers of coating before the present compositions are applied, particularly when the composition according to the present invention is applied as a topcoat.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      When the coating compositions of the invention are applied as a primer layer to a substrate, a pigmented resin coating and optionally a clearcoat layer may be applied over the primer layer.
      <br/>
      In automotive applications, the pigmented resin layer is often called a basecoat or color coat when a clearcoat layer is to be applied on top of it, or a topcoat when the pigmented resin coating is to be the outer layer.
      <br/>
      The resin in the pigmented resin layer can be of a number of resins known in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, the resin can be an acrylic, a polyurethane, or a polyester.
      <br/>
      Typical pigmented resin coating formulations are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,791,168, 4,414,357, and 4,546,046, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, the resin is an  EPSILON -caprolactone-modified acrylic resin, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,720,528, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      The pigmented resin can be cured by any of the known mechanisms and carbonate compounds, such as a melamine polyol reaction (e.g., melamine cure of a hydroxy-functional acrylic resin).
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Other pigmented basecoat compositions for such composite coatings are well-known in the art, and do not require explanation in detail herein.
      <br/>
      Polymers known in the art to be useful in basecoat compositions include acrylics, vinyls, polyurethanes, polycarbonates, polyesters, alkyds, and polysiloxanes.
      <br/>
      Preferred polymers include acrylics and polyurethanes.
      <br/>
      Basecoat polymers are preferably crosslinkable, and thus comprise one or more type of crosslinkable functional groups.
      <br/>
      Such groups include, for example, hydroxy, isocyanate, amine, epoxy, acid, anhydride, acrylate, vinyl, silane, and acetoacetate groups.
      <br/>
      These groups may be masked or blocked in such a way so that they are unblocked and available for the cross-linking reaction under the desired curing conditions, generally elevated temperatures.
      <br/>
      Preferred crosslinkable functional groups include hydroxy functional groups and amino functional groups.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Basecoat polymers may be self-crosslinkable, or may require a separate carbonate compound that is reactive with the functional groups of the polymer.
      <br/>
      When the polymer comprises hydroxy functional groups, for example, the carbonate compound may be selected from aminoplast resins, isocyanates and blocked isocyanates (including isocyanurates), and acid or anhydride functional cross-linking agents.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a clearcoat containing a vehicle having carbamate functionality, as for example a clearcoat according to U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,811, is applied wet-on-wet over a layer of a basecoat composition.
      <br/>
      The coatings applied over the electrocoat coating layer of the invention are applied and, preferably, crosslinked according to methods well-known in the art.

    <p num="42">
      The invention is further described in the following example.
      <br/>
      The example is merely illustrative and does not in any way limit the scope of the invention as described and claimed.
      <br/>
      All parts are parts by weight unless otherwise noted.
