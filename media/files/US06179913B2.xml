      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to the field of vapor-phase deposition.
      <br/>
      This invention further relates to a gas delivery system for epitaxial growth on a substrate.
      <br/>
      The invention also relates to a reaction assembly for generation of a compound gas stream useful in hydride vapor-phase epitaxy.
      <br/>
      This invention still further relates to methods of delivering a reagent gas to a substrate for vapor-phase deposition.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Background of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Hydride vapor-phase epitaxy (HVPE) remains an important technique for the epitaxial growth of various semiconductors, such as gallium nitride (GaN).
      <br/>
      In such a system, growth proceeds due to the high-temperature, vapor-phase reaction between the gallium chloride (GaCl) and ammonia (NH3).
      <br/>
      The ammonia is supplied from a standard gas source, while the GaCl is produced by passing hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas over a heated liquid gallium (Ga) supply heated from 750 to 850 (degree)  C. The GaCl thus produced must be delivered to a substrate, typically through an assembly of tubes.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      One major difficulty associated with prior art GaCl generation and transportation, e.g., in a HVPE system, is the unwanted deposition of solid GaCl on various components of the system.
      <br/>
      GaCl has a high vaporization temperature of more than 500 (degree)  C., and will thus tend to deposit on any surface that is below this temperature.
      <br/>
      Such random deposition reduces the quantity of useful GaCl that is delivered to the substrate for reaction with ammonia, and thus reduces the amount of GaN available for epitaxial growth.
      <br/>
      In addition, deposits of GaCl tend to build up in the gas delivery system, eventually blocking efficient flow of reagents.
      <br/>
      Unwanted deposition is a particular problem in HVPE systems, where the epitaxial growth rates on the substrate are large, since large amounts of reagents must be transported within the system.
      <br/>
      As a result, frequent cleaning of the system is necessary to remove unwanted deposits.
      <br/>
      Cleaning and maintenance of HVPE systems and equipment components is a difficult, costly, time-consuming, and hazardous task.
      <br/>
      Moreover, where it is desired to deposit a thick layer of GaN on a substrate, unwanted deposition can reach problematic levels during the course of a single growth cycle, whereas cleaning and maintenance of the HVPE system can only be performed after a growth cycle is complete.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Prior art methods for avoiding deposition of GaCl in a HVPE system have involved heating all system components, e.g., tubes, lines, nozzles, to high temperatures.
      <br/>
      This complicates the design of the system, leading to operational problems and increased costs.
      <br/>
      In particular, the use of high temperatures to prevent GaCl deposition restricts the design and operation of the system, in that typically the GaCl must be produced in a chamber located very close to the substrate on which deposition is to take place.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another drawback associated with prior art HVPE systems and methods is that the source or reagent gases often react prematurely, i.e., before reaching the substrate.
      <br/>
      For example, GaCl and ammonia tend to combine to form GaN on surfaces other than the substrate.
      <br/>
      Such premature deposition not only decreases the growth rate of the epitaxial layer, but also leads to unwanted deposition of GaN, e.g., on the walls of the reactor or growth chamber.
      <br/>
      Deposition of unwanted GaN can lead to clogging of the system, and also limits the distance between the GaCl production chamber and the substrate.
      <br/>
      Prior art attempts at avoiding premature, or non-target, deposition have focused on maintaining the Ga well below the reaction temperature of 1000-1100 (degree)  C. However, this is difficult, especially since it must be done together with heating above the GaCl evaporation temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The present invention overcomes problems associated with premature or non-target deposition of both reagent (e.g., GaCl) and reaction product (e.g., GaN) in prior art vapor-phase chemical deposition systems and methods.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">In view of the above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of generating a gas stream for vapor-phase deposition.</p>
    <p num="10">One feature of the invention is that it provides a method for generating a compound gas stream for projection towards a substrate in an epitaxy system.</p>
    <p num="11">Another feature of the invention is that it provides a reaction assembly having a gullet outlet and a sheath outlet.</p>
    <p num="12">Another feature of the invention is that it provides a stream of sheath gas which prevents premature deposition of reagent gas in a vapor-phase deposition system.</p>
    <p num="13">Another feature of the invention is that it provides a stream of sheath gas which prevents premature reaction of reagent gases during vapor-phase deposition.</p>
    <p num="14">Another feature of the invention is that it provides a method for promoting efficient use of reagent gases for epitaxial growth in a HVPE system.</p>
    <p num="15">One advantage of the invention is that it provides a HVPE system which prevents non-target deposition during hydride vapor-phase epitaxy.</p>
    <p num="16">Another advantage of the invention is that it provides a reaction assembly having a gullet outlet at least partially encircled by a sheath outlet.</p>
    <p num="17">Another advantage of the invention is that it provides a reaction assembly for generating a compound gas stream.</p>
    <p num="18">Another advantage of the invention is that it provides a compound gas stream having a sheath gas enveloping a reagent gas.</p>
    <p num="19">Another advantage of the invention is that it provides a method for generating a compound gas stream having an enveloping sheath gas and an envelope reagent gas.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Another advantage of the invention is that it provides a method for introducing a compound sheath gas of an inert carrier gas and a corrosive etching gas such as HCl.
      <br/>
      The corrosive etching gas affects growth rates for nitride films that are deposited and can lead to highly uniform films with a high degree of crystalline character.
      <br/>
      A second advantage to introducing a corrosive etching gas in combination with of an inert carrier gas is that the etching gas prevent build-up of nitride deposition at or near the ejecting portion of the reaction assembly and thus reduces the maintenance associated with cleaning the deposition equipment.

      FIG. 4A schematically represents the projection of a compound gas stream 42 from reaction assembly 30, according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Compound gas stream 42 projects from compound nozzle 33 towards substrate 14, the latter mounted on a susceptor 12.
      <br/>
      Compound gas stream 42 comprises a stream of reagent gas 44 emanating from gullet outlet 34b, and a stream of sheath or carrier gas 46 flowing from sheath outlet 32b.
      <br/>
      In compound gas stream 42, reagent gas 44 is at least partially enveloped by sheath gas 46.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      FIG. 4B is a cross-sectional view of compound gas stream 42, taken along the line 4B--4B of FIG. 4A, and depicting reagent gas 44 as being completely enveloped by sheath gas 46.
      <br/>
      According to a currently preferred embodiment, reagent gas 44 flows substantially concentrically within sheath gas 46 towards substrate 14.
      <br/>
      When compound gas stream 42 approaches substrate 14, the presence of the hot substrate leads to turbulence which breaks the protective layer of sheath gas 46, allowing reagent gas 44 to react, e.g., with ammonia gas introduced into growth chamber 21 via growth chamber inlet 22.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      According to one example of compound gas stream 42, reagent gas 44 includes GaCl and sheath gas 46 includes an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, helium and hydrogen.
      <br/>
      When compound gas stream 42 experiences turbulence in the vicinity of substrate 14, concentric flow is disturbed allowing the GaCl to react with ammonia gas to form GaN.
      <br/>
      Before this point, however, the inert gas protects the GaCl, preventing unwanted deposition of GaCl, e.g., on wall 23 of growth chamber 21.
      <br/>
      This prevention of reagent gas deposition on system components is especially beneficial in the case of gullet outlet 34b, where deposits would otherwise tend to build up and eventually restrict flow of reagent gas from outlet 34b.
      <br/>
      A further advantage of reaction assembly 30 is that sheath gas 46 prevents reagent gas 44 (e.g., GaCl) from mixing with ammonia before reaching substrate 14, thereby avoiding premature production and deposition of GaN.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Again referring to FIG. 4B, the dual flow design of the gas delivery system of the current invention allows for introduction of a corrosive etching gas along with the inert sheath gas 46.
      <br/>
      The corrosive etching gas is preferably HCl, but may also be HNO3, H2 SO4, NF3 and SF6 or any number of etching gases known to etch metal nitrides.
      <br/>
      The corrosive etching gas in the sheath gas stream enhance can be controlled to cause different rates of etching of metal nitrides that are deposited on the substrate.
      <br/>
      Etching the metal-nitrite during deposition can greatly growth rates, and morphologies of the metal nitride produced.
      <br/>
      Further, the introduction of the corrosive etching gas in the sheath gas stream helps to prevent deposition of materials at the end of the gas delivery system from where the gas are injected into the growth chamber.
      <br/>
      Conventional systems do not provide a convenient method to introduce a corrosive etch gas at the high temperature region of the system to prevent build up.

      FIG. 5 schematically represents a method for delivering a reagent gas to a substrate, according to another embodiment of the invention, in which step 50 involves arranging a substrate within a growth chamber of a vapor-phase deposition system.

      Step 52 involves projecting a stream of reagent gas towards the substrate.
      <br/>
      The reagent gas may include, e.g., a chloride of an element of group III of the periodic table, such as GaCl, InCl, AlCl GaCl3, InCl3, AlCl3.
      <br/>
      The stream of reagent gas projected towards the substrate is at least partially enveloped within a stream of inert sheath (or carrier) gas or inert sheath gas/acid (HCl) mixture.

      The stream of reagent gas and the stream of sheath gas together form a compound gas stream.

      <br/>
      The sheath gas may serve as a conduit for the reagent gas as the latter is projected towards the heated substrate within the growth chamber.
      <br/>
      The sheath gas prevents deposition of the reagent gas as a solid, and prevents premature reaction of the reagent gas with other gases, e.g., ammonia (step 54).
      <br/>
      Step 54 involves introducing ammonia gas into the growth chamber of the vapor-phase deposition system.
      <br/>

      FIG. 6 schematically represents a series of steps involved in a method for vapor-phase deposition on a substrate, according to another embodiment of the invention, in which step 60 involves providing a deposition system.

      The deposition system provided in step 60 includes a growth chamber and a reaction assembly, and may additionally include other elements or features as described hereinabove with reference to system 10 (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      According to one embodiment, the deposition system provided in step 60 is a HVPE system for epitaxial deposition of, e.g., GaN or InN.
      <br/>
      Step 62 involves arranging a substrate within the growth chamber of the deposition system.
      <br/>
      The substrate is preferably sapphire or a sappire substrate with a buffer layer.
      <br/>
      Step 64 involves introducing a stream of reagent gas into the growth chamber via a compound nozzle of the reaction assembly.
      <br/>
      The reagent gas introduced into the growth chamber is at least partially enveloped by a sheath gas.
      <br/>
      The reagent gas and sheath gas together form a compound gas stream which is projected from the compound nozzle.
      <br/>
      The reagent gas is preferably GaCl, InCl, or AlCl, most preferably GaCl; while the sheath gas includes an inert gas, preferably nitrogen.
      <br/>
      The compound gas stream is projected towards the substrate.
      <br/>
      In the vicinity of the substrate, turbulence disrupts the integrity of the compound gas stream, allowing the reagent gas to react with ammonia gas, in turn leading to deposition on the substrate surface.

      FIG. 7 schematically represents a series of steps involved in a method for generating a compound gas stream, according to another embodiment of the invention, in which step 70 involves providing a reaction assembly.
      <br/>
      The reaction assembly provided in step 70 includes a sheath, a reaction chamber located within the sheath, a sheath inlet leading to the sheath, a gullet inlet leading to the reaction chamber, a sheath outlet leading from the sheath, and a gullet outlet leading from the reaction chamber.

    <p num="49">
      A metal element, such as one selected from the group consisting of Ga, In, and Al, is introduced into the reaction chamber, and heat is applied to provide a reservoir containing a molten metal.
      <br/>
      In the case of liquid Ga, the Ga is maintained at a temperature of about 800 (degree)  C. A regulated flow of precursor gas, e.g., HCl, introduced into the reaction chamber via the gullet inlet, reacts with the molten metal to form the reagent gas (e.g., GaCl).
      <br/>
      The reagent gas is then projected from the gullet outlet in step 74.
      <br/>
      At the same time, a constant flow of sheath gas, e.g., nitrogen, is projected into the sheath of the reaction assembly and out of the sheath outlet, according to step 76.
      <br/>
      The sheath gas projected from the sheath outlet and the reagent gas projected from the gullet outlet together form a compound gas stream which is projected towards the substrate.

      In a preferred embodiment of the method of FIG. 7, the reagent gas is substantially concentric with the sheath gas within the compound gas stream until the reagent gas reaches the vicinity of the heated substrate.

      The instant invention has been described with particular reference to deposition of nitrides such as gallium nitride by a horizontal HVPE system.
