    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an optical connector connecting structure for connecting an internal optical connector in a communication device to an external optical connector outside of the communication device.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In the field of optical communication or the like, an optical connector is used to detachably connect optical fibers used as a transmission line.
      <br/>
      This kind of optical connector has such a configuration as to coaxially butt the polished end faces of optical fibers.
      <br/>
      If the optical fibers connected by the optical connector are misaligned, a connection loss increases, and it is therefore required for the optical connector to prevent such misalignment in butting the end faces of the optical fibers.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Various types of optical connectors specified by JIS, IEC, etc. are present as the optical connector for use in optical fiber communication.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an adapter capable of converting to a different type is used to connect different types of optical connectors.
      <br/>
      Such an adapter is required to connect an internal optical connector in a communication device and an external optical connector outside of the communication device.
      <br/>
      Conventionally, such an adapter is fixed by screws to a mounting bracket in the communication device.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      An adapter for connecting optical connectors of the same type and an adapter for connecting optical connectors of different types are different in structure.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in the case that the adapter for connecting the optical connectors of the same type is fixed by screws to the communication device and if the external optical connector is different in type from the internal optical connector, it is necessary to fix an adapter suitable for supporting the external optical connector.
      <br/>
      In this case, the following troublesome work for exchange of the adapters is conventionally carried out.
      <br/>
      That is, the adapter previously fixed to the communication device is first removed by loosening the screws, and the adapter supporting the external optical connector is next fixed to the communication device by the screws.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an optical connector connecting structure for a communication device which allows easy exchange of an adapter according to an external optical connector to be connected.</p>
    <p num="8">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a holder for optically connecting first and second optical connectors through an adapter, comprising a holding means for elastically holding the first optical connector; and a locking means for locking the adapter so as to prevent removal of the adapter from the first optical connector in the condition where the first optical connector is connected with the adapter.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a perspective view of a package 2 for a communication device (not shown).
      <br/>
      The package 2 has a three-stage configuration having three printed wiring boards 4, 6, and 8.
      <br/>
      The package 2 is adapted to be mounted into a shelf (not shown) to configure the communication device.
      <br/>
      An optical connector connecting structure 10 according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention is mounted on the printed wiring board 8.
      <br/>
      The optical connector connecting structure 10 includes a holder 12 fixed to the printed wiring board 8.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The holder 12 has a pair of holding portions (optical connector holding members) and an adapter insertion opening.
      <br/>
      A first optical connector (internal optical connector) 14 is held between a pair of holding portions of the holder 12.
      <br/>
      An adapter 16 is inserted through the opening of the holder 12 and engaged with the first optical connector 14.
      <br/>
      A second optical connector (external optical connector) 18 is inserted in the adapter 16.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the second optical connector 18 is connected through the adapter 16 to the first optical connector 14.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The first optical connector 14 is connected through an optical fiber cord 15 to an optical module (not shown) in the communication device.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the second optical connector 18 is connected through an optical fiber cord 19 to an optical module (not shown) outside of the communication device.
      <br/>
      Another optical connector connecting structure 10' having the same configuration as that of the optical connector connecting structure 10 is also mounted on the printed wiring board 8.
      <br/>
      In the optical connector connecting structure 10' the same parts as those of the optical connector connecting structure 10 are denoted by the same reference numerals with primes ('), and the description thereof will be omitted herein.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, reference numeral 20 denotes an electrical connector of the package 2 to be connected to a backboard connector (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The optical connector connecting structure 10 according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to FIGS. 2 to 4.
      <br/>
      The holder 12 has a pair of holding portions 22 and a gate portion 24.
      <br/>
      Each holding portion 22 is formed of resin and has elasticity.
      <br/>
      The gate portion 24 has an opening 26 for insertion of the adapter 16 (or 48).
      <br/>
      By forcing down the first optical connector 14 between a pair of holding portions 22 against their elastic forces, the first optical connector 14 is held by the elasticity of the holding portions 22.
      <br/>
      The first optical connector 14 has a ferrule 28 and a projection 30.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The holder 12 has four holes 32 for fixing the holder 12 to the printed wiring board 8 by means of rivets or the like (see FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      The first optical connector 14 is an SC connector.
      <br/>
      The adapter 16 is an adapter for converting the SC connector into an FC connector.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the adapter 16 has an SC housing 34 and an FC housing 40 opposite to the SC housing 34.
      <br/>
      The SC housing 34 is formed with a notch 36 for engaging the projection 30 of the first optical connector 14 and a pair of leaf springs 38 for maintaining the engagement of the adapter 16 with the first optical connector 14.
      <br/>
      The FC housing 40 is a cylindrical member formed with an external screw thread 42.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The second optical connector 18 is an FC connector, which has a ferrule 46 and a nut 44 for threadedly engaging with the external screw thread 42 of the FC housing 40 of the adapter 16.
      <br/>
      In the case of connecting the second optical connector (FC connector) 18 to the first optical connector (SC connector) 14, the adapter 16 is used.
      <br/>
      That is, the SC housing 34 of the adapter 16 is inserted through the opening 26 of the holder 12 and engaged with the first optical connector 14.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As best shown in FIG. 3, the notch 36 of the adapter 16 is engaged with the projection 30 of the first optical connector 14, thus mounting the adapter 16 to the first optical connector 14.
      <br/>
      In this condition, a pair of leaf springs 38 of the adapter 16 interfere with the gate portion 24 of the holder 12, thereby preventing undue withdrawal of the adapter 16 from the holder 12.
      <br/>
      In this case, the gate portion 24 functions as locking means for preventing withdrawal of the adapter 16 from the holder 12.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In this condition that the adapter 16 is connected to the first optical connector 14, the second optical connector (FC connector) 18 is inserted into the FC housing 40 of the adapter 16, and the nut 44 is secured to the external screw thread 42, thereby mounting the second optical connector 18 to the adapter 16 as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      In this condition, the ferrule 28 of the first optical connector 14 and the ferrule 46 of the second optical connector 18 are in abutment against each other, thereby connecting optical fibers (not shown) in the ferrules 28 and 46 to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Referring to FIG. 2, reference numeral 48 denotes another type of adapter for connecting optical connectors of the same type.
      <br/>
      The adapter 48 is symmetrically formed in respect of its longitudinal direction except a pair of leaf springs 54.
      <br/>
      That is, the adapter 48 is composed of a pair of SC housings 50 and 50' symmetrical in shape with each other except that the SC housing 50 has the leaf springs 54.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the SC housing 50 of the adapter 48 has a notch 52 similar to the notch 36 of the SC housing 34 of the adapter 16 and has the leaf springs 54 similar to the leaf springs 38 of the SC housing 34 of the adapter 16, whereas the SC housing 50' of the adapter 48 has a notch 52' similar to the notch 52, but it has no leaf springs.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Reference numeral 56 denotes a third optical connector 56 which is an SC connector having a projection 58 and a ferrule 60.
      <br/>
      The third optical connector 56 is connected through an optical fiber cord 59 to an optical module (not shown) outside of the communication device.
      <br/>
      In the case of connecting the third optical connector 56 to the first optical connector 14, the adapter 48 is used.
      <br/>
      That is, the adapter 16 is first removed from the holder 12 in the condition where the leaf springs 38 is pressed.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the SC housing 50 of the adapter 48 is inserted through the opening 26 of the holder 12 and mounted to the first optical connector 14.
      <br/>
      In this condition that the adapter 48 is connected with the first optical connector 14, the third optical connector 56 is inserted into the SC housing 50' of the adapter 48 to thereby make the ferrule 60 of the third optical connector 56 abut against the ferrule 28 of the first optical connector 14.
      <br/>
      Thus, an optical fiber (not shown) in the ferrule 60 of the third optical connector 56 is connected to the optical fiber (not shown) in the ferrule 28 of the first optical connector 14.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In the case of testing the communication device in a factory, the adapter 48 is rotated 180 (degree)  to mount the SC housing 50' to the first optical connector 14.
      <br/>
      Because the SC housing 50' has no leaf springs, the adapter 48 can be freely mounted and demounted in such direction with respect to the first optical connector 14, thereby allowing easy testing of the communication device.
      <br/>
      However, in shipping the communication device from the factory, the SC housing 50 having the leaf springs 54 is mounted to the first optical connector 14, so as to prevent undue removal of the adapter 48 from the holder 12 at a destination.
    </p>
    <p num="26">The holder 12 in the first preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to FIGS. 5A to 10B.
