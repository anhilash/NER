    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Electroluminescent elements comprise at least a light-emitting material.
      <br/>
      Organic electroluminescent elements are elements constructed using organic compounds which emit light in response to electric signals.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Organic electroluminescent elements basically comprise an organic luminescent layer interposed between a pair of opposed electrodes.
      <br/>
      Luminescence is a phenomenon which occurs when a luminescent body within the luminescent layer is excited to a higher energy level and the excited luminescent body returns to its original base state discharging said surplus energy as light.
      <br/>
      This is achieved by the injection of electrons from one electrode and the injection of holes from the other electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In order to improve luminescence efficiency, the aforesaid basic construction is supplemented by a hole-injection layer added to the electrode that injects holes, while an electron transport layer is added to the electrode that injects electrons.</p>
    <p num="8">An example of an electroluminescent element is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,530,325 which uses single crystals of anthracene in the luminescent element.</p>
    <p num="9">Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. 59-194393 discloses a combination of a hole-injection layer and an organic luminescent layer.</p>
    <p num="10">Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. 63-295695 discloses a combination of an organic hole-injection/transporting layer and an organic electron-injection/transporting layer.</p>
    <p num="11">
      Organic electroluminescent elements having the aforesaid laminate layer construction are prepared by superimposing an organic fluorescent body, charge-transporting organic material (charge-transporting member), and electrodes, such that luminescence is generated when holes and electrons injected by their respective electrodes move within the charge-transporting member and recombine.
      <br/>
      Examples of materials which are useful as organic fluorescent bodies include organic pigments which generate fluorescence such as 8-quinolinol-aluminum complex, coumarin compounds and the like.
      <br/>
      Examples of useful charge-transporting materials include N'-di(m-tolyl)N,N'-diphenylbenzidene, 1,1-bis�N,N-di(p-tolyl)aminophenyl�cyclohexane and diamino compounds, 4-(N,N-diphenyl)aminobenzaldehyde-N,N-diphenylhydrazone compounds and the like.
      <br/>
      The use of porphyrin compounds such as copper phthalocyanine has also been proposed.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Although organic electroluminescent elements have high luminescence characteristics, prior art devices have been shown to have inadequate stability when luminescent and/or during storage.
      <br/>
      Thus, they are not suitable for practical use.
      <br/>
      The stability of the charge-transporting layer in prior art devices has been poor, resulting in instability in the element during luminescence and/or storage.
      <br/>
      The layers of the electroluminescent element formed by organic material range in thickness from a hundred to several hundred nanometers, and require high voltage application per unit thickness.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, such elements generate heat due to current flow and luminescence; therefore, the charge transporting material must be electrically, thermally, and chemically stable.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="13">In view of the above, an objective of the present invention is to provide an organic electroluminescent element having high luminescent intensity together with functional stability despite repeated use.</p>
    <p num="14">These objectives are attained by providing an organic electroluminescent element comprising:</p>
    <p num="15">
      a positive electrode having an ionization potential of 5.18-5.35 eV;
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">
      The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements.
      <br/>
      Various modifications to the preferred embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.
    </p>
    <p num="19">The present invention relates to an organic electroluminescent element provided with a positive electrode, hole-injection layer, hole-transporting layer, luminescent layer, and negative electrode, wherein said positive electrode has an ionization potential of 5.18-5.35 eV, said hole-injection layer has an ionization potential of 4.80-5.18 eV, and said hole-transporting layer has an ionization potential of 5.20-5.70 eV.</p>
    <p num="20">The organic electroluminescent element of the present invention comprises at least a hole-injection layer (2), a hole-transporting layer (3), and an organic luminescent layer (4) interposed between a positive electrode (1), and a negative electrode (5), as shown in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="21">
      The conductive materials used as positive electrodes (1) of the organic electroluminescent element will have an ionization potential of 5.18-5.35 eV, and preferably 5.20-5.35 eV, which can be obtained by controlling the amount of doping or degree of oxidation of conductive metallic compounds such as tin oxide, indium oxide, antimony oxide, zinc oxide, zirconium oxide and the like.
      <br/>
      The positive electrode may have an ionization potential of 5.18-5.35 eV adjusted by a method such as oxygen plasma or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Examples of metals useful as the negative electrode include silver, aluminum, and metals having work function of less than 4 eV including magnesium, calcium, titanium, yttrium, lithium, gadolinium, ytterbium, ruthenium, manganese and alloys thereof.
      <br/>
      Alloys of silver and magnesium, as well as aluminum are also desirable.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The electrical resistance of the positive and negative electrodes will be preferably as low as possible from the perspective of current flow impairment and heat generation; specifically a resistance of 100  OMEGA cm (volume resistivity) is desirable.</p>
    <p num="24">
      In organic electroluminescent elements, it is necessary that at least the positive electrode (3) or negative electrode (5) is a transparent electrode so that the luminescence is visible.
      <br/>
      Since when the negative electrode is made the transparent electrode it is readily subject to oxidation deterioration and resultant loss of transparency, it is desirable that the positive electrode be made the transparent electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="25">When forming a transparent electrode, conductive materials such as those listed above may be formed on a transparent substrate using a method such as vacuum deposition, spattering and the like, sol-gel, or an application of said material dispersed in resin or the like so as to maintain a desired light transmittance and electrical conductivity.</p>
    <p num="26">
      The transparent substrate is not particularly limited insofar as said material is transparent and has suitable strength and is impervious to adverse effects of heat during vacuum deposition and during manufacture of the organic electroluminescent device.
      <br/>
      Examples of useful materials include glass, and transparent resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyether sulfone, polyether-etherketone and the like.
      <br/>
      Well known commercial products such as indium-tin oxide ("ITO"), NESA and the like may be used to form a transparent electrode on a glass substrate.
      <br/>
      NESA is a commercial product of Corning, Co.
    </p>
    <p num="27">The hole-injection layer (2) is formed on the positive electrode (1) so as to have an ionization potential of 4.80-5.18 eV, and preferably 4.80-5.15 eV. It is desirable that the ionization potential of the hole-injection layer (2) is less than the ionization potential of the positive electrode (1), i.e., 0.05-0.40 eV lower, and preferably 0.08-0.45 eV lower.</p>
    <p num="28">
      Compounds for forming the hole-injection layer are compounds having hole transportability, and are not specifically limited insofar as such materials possess the aforesaid characteristics; examples of useful materials include styryl compounds.
      <br/>
      More specifically, desirable compounds are described below.
      <br/>
      These compounds may be used in combinations of two or more.

    </p>
    <p num="29">Hole-injection layer (2) may be formed by vacuum deposition of the aforesaid materials, or may be formed by dip-coating or spin-coating of a solution in which said materials are dissolved or dissolved together with a suitable resin.</p>
    <p num="30">When forming the hole-injection layer via vacuum deposition, the thickness of the layer is normally 0.1-30 nm, and when formed via an application method, the thickness is about 1-50 nm.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Fatigue of the organic electroluminescent element readily occurs when luminescence efficiency deteriorates due to the necessity of applying a higher voltage to induce luminescence as the layer thickness increases.
      <br/>
      When the layer is too thin, luminescence efficiency is excellent, but the layer becomes susceptible to breakdown which shortens the service life of the organic electroluminescent element.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Next a hole-transporting layer (3) is formed on the hole-injection layer (2).
      <br/>
      The hole-transporting layer is formed so as to have an ionization potential of 5.20-5.70 eV, and preferably 5.20-5.68 eV. It is desirable that the ionization potential of the hole-transporting layer (3) is higher than the ionization potential of the hole-injection layer (2), i.e., 0.05-0.70 eV higher, and preferably 0.08-0.67 eV higher.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The compounds used to form the hole-transporting layer will be compounds having hole-transporting characteristics and are not limited insofar as such compounds possess the aforesaid characteristics.
      <br/>
      Examples of useful compounds include arylamino compounds, specific examples of which are given below.

    <p num="34">The hole-transporting layer (3) may be formed by vacuum deposition of the aforesaid materials, or may be formed by dip-coating or spin-coating of a solution in which said materials are dissolved or dissolved together with a suitable resin.</p>
    <p num="35">When forming the hole-transporting layer via vacuum deposition, the thickness of the layer is normally 30-100 nm, and when formed via an application method, the thickness is about 50-200 nm.</p>
    <p num="36">
      Fatigue of the organic electroluminescent element occurs and luminescence efficiency deteriorates due to the necessity of applying a higher voltage as the layer thickness increases.
      <br/>

    <p num="37">
      An organic luminescent layer 4 is formed on the aforesaid hole-transporting layer 3.
