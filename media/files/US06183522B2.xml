      Described are dye mixtures comprising one or more azo dyes (1) and one or more azo dyes (2) or (3) or (2) and (3), all these azo dyes containing a 1-(halotriazinylamino)-3,6- or -4,6-disulfo-8-naphthol coupling component and the third substituent in the triazine moiety of (1) and similarly of (2) and of (3) being an optionally alkyl- and/or phenyl-substituted amino radical or heterocyclic radical and the diazo component in (1) containing a fiber-reactive group of the vinyl sulfone series and being an optionally alkyl- and/or alkoxy-substituted phenyl or optionally sulfo-substituted naphthyl radical, in (2) being an optionally alkyl-, alkoxy-, chlorine-, bromine-, sulfo- and/or carboxyl-substituted phenyl or optionally sulfo-substituted naphthyl radical and in (3) being a sulfophenyl radical which, attached via an amino group, possesses a fiber-reactive halopyrimidine radical or a halotriazine radical having a fiber-reactive group of the vinyl sulfone series.
      <br/>
      The dye mixtures are very useful for dyeing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing materials, especially fiber materials, in deep bluish to yellowish red shades.

    <p num="1">Dye mixtures comprising water-soluble fiber-reactive azo dyes, preparation thereof and use thereof</p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to the technical field of fiber-reactive azo dyes.</p>
    <p num="3">
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 4988803, 5097021, 5342927, 5541300 and 5548072 disclose monoazo dyes containing a fiber-reactive radical of the amino-substituted halotriazinylamino series with or without a further fiber-reactive radical of the vinyl sulfone or fluoropyrimidinyl series.
      <br/>
      However, the dyes described therein have certain application defects, for example an excessive dependence of the color yield on changing dyeing parameters in the dyeing process, an insufficient solubility in the aqueous dyebath at higher dyeconcentrations in the presence of electrolyte salts or an insufficient color build-up on cotton and especially viscose (good color build-up follows from the ability of a dye to produce a correspondingly stronger dyeing from an increased dye concentration in the dyebath).
      <br/>
      Possible consequences of these shortcomings are poor reproducibilities for the dyeings which are obtainable.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      However, it is particularly important to obtain dyeings having a good color yield, i.e., dyeings whose depth of shade is very high in relation to the amount of dye used, for example in comparison with other dyes, because of the coloring property of the dye itself (high absorbance) and because of the dyeing characteristics of this dye, such as good affinity and a high yield of fixation.
      <br/>
      If mixtures of dyes having a certain color yield are used, the color yield of this mixture of dyes will generally be the average of the color yields of the individual dyes.
      <br/>
      The color yield of a mixture of, for example, two dyes will therefore be lower than the color yield of that dye having the larger color yield property.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The present invention, then, provides dye mixtures which provide dyeings having a color yield which is surprisingly distinctly higher than the average of the color yields of the dyeings of the individual dyes in the dye mixture.
      <br/>
      This synergistic effect also shows itself in improved build-up characteristics on the part of the mixture of the invention compared with the individual dyes in the mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The invention accordingly provides dye mixtures comprising at least 2, such as 3 or 4, preferably 3 and particularly preferably 2, dyes selected from the group of the dyes of the general formulae (1), (2) and (3), where at least one of the dyes conforms to the general formula (1):  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>

      The dye mixtures of the invention can be present as a preparation in solid or in liquid (dissolved) form.
      <br/>
      In solid form, they generally include the electrolyte salts customary for water-soluble and especially for fiber-reactive dyes, such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium sulfate, and may further comprise the auxiliaries customary in commercial dyes, such as buffer substances capable of setting a pH in aqueous solution between 3 and 7, such as sodium acetate, sodium citrate, sodium borate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate and disodium hydrogenphosphate, dyeing auxiliaries, dustproofing agents and small amounts of siccatives; if they are present in a liquid, aqueous solution (including the presence of thickeners of the type customary in print pastes), they may also include substances which ensure a long life for these preparations, for example mold preventatives.

      The dye mixture fraction in the preparations ranges from 10 to 80% by weight, based on the preparation.
      <br/>
      The buffer substances are generally present in a total amount of up to 5% by weight, based on the preparation.
      <br/>
      If the dye mixtures of the invention are present in aqueous solution, the total dye content of these aqueous solutions will be up to about 50% by weight, for example between 5 and 50% by weight, and the electrolyte salt content of these aqueous solutions will preferably be below 10% by weight, based on the aqueous solution; the aqueous solutions (liquid preparations) may include the aforementioned buffer substances in an amount which is generally up to 5% by weight, preferably up to 2% by weight.

    <p num="24">The separation from their synthesis solution of the chemically produced dye mixtures of the invention can be effected by commonly known methods, for example either by precipitating from the reaction medium by means of electrolytes, for example sodium chloride or potassium chloride, or by evaporating or spray-drying the reaction solution, in which case this reaction solution may have a buffer substance added to it.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The dye mixtures of the invention may include further fiber-reactive dyes which are used for shading the dye mixture; in an amount of up to 5% by weight.
      <br/>
      These "shading dyes" can be added by customary mixing or else be prepared chemically in the same reaction batch together with the above-described synthesis of a dye mixture of the invention and be incorporated into the dye mixture when one or more of the components of the shading dye are identical with the components of the dyes of the formulae (1), (2) and/or (3).
      <br/>
      For instance, to prepare a dye mixture according to the invention which includes a shading dye having a certain chromophore, it is possible to use such additional starting compounds in the reaction batch as, instead of the 3,6-disulfo-1-amino-8-naphthol component of the dyes (1), (2) and/or (3), contain, as component, 4,6-disulfo-1-amino-8-naphthol or 2- or 3-amino-6-sulfo-8-naphthol or a 1-(aminophenyl)-3-carboxy- or -3-methyl-5-pyrazolone.

    <p num="26">
      The dye mixtures of the invention have useful application properties.
      <br/>
      They are used for dyeing or printing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing materials, for example in the form of sheetlike structures, such as paper and leather or of films, for example composed of polyamide, or in bulk, as for example of polyamide and polyurethane, but especially for dyeing or printing these materials in fiber form.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the solutions obtained in the synthesis of the dye mixtures of the invention, if desired after addition of a buffer substance, and also if desired after concentrating or diluting, can be used directly as liquid preparation for dyeing.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The present invention thus also provides for the use of the dye mixtures of the invention for dyeing or printing these materials, or rather to processes for dyeing or printing these materials in a conventional manner, by using a dye mixture of the invention or its individual components (dyes) individually together as colorant.
      <br/>
      The materials are preferably employed in the form of fiber materials, especially in the form of textile fibers, such as woven fabrics or yarns, as in the form of hanks or wound packages.

      Hydroxyl-containing materials are those of natural or synthetic origin, for example cellulose fiber materials or their regenerated products and polyvinyl alcohols.
      <br/>
      Cellulose fiber materials are preferably cotton, but also other vegetable fibers, such as linen, hemp, jute and ramie fibers; regenerated cellulose fibers are for example staple viscose and filament viscose.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Carboxamido-containing materials are for example synthetic and natural polyamides and polyurethanes, especially in the form of fibers, for example wool and other animal hairs, silk, leather, nylon-6,6, nylon-6, nylon-11 and nylon-4.</p>
    <p num="30">
      The dye mixtures of the invention can be applied to and fixed on the substrates mentioned, especially the fiber materials mentioned, by the application techniques known for water-soluble dyes, especially fiber-reactive dyes.
      <br/>
      For instance, on cellulose fibers they produce from a long liquor by the exhaust method and by means of various acid-binding agents with or without neutral salts, such as sodium chloride or sodium sulfate, dyeings having very good color yields which are improved compared with the individual dyes.
      <br/>
      They are preferably applied from an aqueous bath at temperatures between 40 and 105 (degree)  C., if desired at temperatures up to 130 (degree)  C. under superatmospheric pressure, and if desired in the presence of customary dyeing auxiliaries.
      <br/>
      One possible procedure is to introduce the material into the warm bath and to gradually heat the bath to the desired dyeing temperature and to complete the dyeing process at that temperature.
      <br/>
      The neutral salts which speed up the exhaustion of the dyes can if desired not be added to the bath until after the actual dyeing temperature has been reached.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The padding process likewise produces excellent color yields and a very good color build-up on cellulose fibers, on which fixing can be effected by batching at room temperature or elevated temperature, for example at up to about 60 (degree)  C., by steaming or with dry heat in a conventional manner.</p>
    <p num="32">
      Similarly, the customary printing processes for cellulose fibers, which can be carried out either single-phase, for example by printing with a print paste comprising sodium bicarbonate or some other acid-binding agent and by subsequent steaming at 100 to 103 (degree)  C., or two-phase, for example by printing with a neutral or weakly acidic print paste and subsequent fixation either by passing the printed material through a hot electrolyte-comprising alkaline bath or by overpadding with an alkaline electrolyte-comprising padding liquor with subsequent batching of this treated material or subsequent steaming or subsequent treatment with dry heat, produce strong prints with well-defined contours and a clear white ground.
      <br/>
      The appearance of the prints is not greatly affected by variations in the fixing conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      When fixing by means of dry heat in accordance with the customary thermofix processes, hot air from 120 to 200 (degree)  C. is used.
      <br/>
      In addition to the customary steam at 101 to 103 (degree)  C. it is also possible to use superheated steam and high-pressure steam at temperatures of up to 160 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The acid-binding agents which effect the fixation of the dyes of the dye mixtures of the invention on the cellulose fibers include for example water-soluble basic salts of the alkali metals and likewise alkaline earth metals of inorganic or organic acids or compounds which liberate alkali in the heat.
      <br/>
      Especially suitable are the alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal salts of weak to medium inorganic or organic acids, the preferred alkali metal compounds being the sodium and potassium compounds.
      <br/>
      Such acid-binding agents include for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium formate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, disodium hydrogenphosphate, sodium trichloroacetate, waterglass or trisodium phosphate.
      <br/>
      The dye mixtures of the invention are notable for a high yield of fixation when applied to the cellulose fiber materials by dyeing or printing.
      <br/>
      The cellulose dyeings obtained following the customary aftertreatment by rinsing to remove unfixed dye portions exhibit excellent wetfastnesses, in particular since such unfixed dye portions are easily washed off on account of their good solubility in cold water.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The dyeings and prints obtainable with the dye mixtures of the invention have bright hues; especially the dyeings and prints on cellulose fiber materials have good lightfastness and especially very good wetfastnesses, such as wash, milling, water, seawater, crossdyeing and acidic and also alkaline perspiration fastness properties, also good fastness to pleating, hotpressing and rubbing.</p>
    <p num="36">
      Furthermore, the dye mixtures of the invention can also be used for the fiber-reactive dyeing of wool.
      <br/>
      Moreover, wool which has been given a nonfelting or low-felting finish (cf. H. Rath, Lehrbuch derTextilchemie, Springer-Verlag, 3rd Edition (1972), p. 295-299, especially the finish by the so-called Hercosett process (p. 298); J. Soc. Dyers and Colourists 1972, 93-99, and 1975, 33-44) can be dyed with very good fastness properties.
      <br/>
      The process of dyeing on wool is here carried out in a conventional manner from an acidic medium.
      <br/>
      For instance, acetic acid and/or ammonium sulfate or acetic acid and ammonium acetate or sodium acetate may be added to the dyebath to obtain the desired pH.
      <br/>
      To obtain a dyeing of acceptable levelness, it is advisable to add a customary leveling agent, for example on the basis of a reaction product of cyanuric chloride with 3 times the molar amount of an aminobenzenesulfonic acid and/or of an aminonaphthalenesulfonic acid or on the basis of a reaction product of for example stearylamine with ethylene oxide.
      <br/>
      For instance, the dye mixture of the invention is preferably subjected to the exhaustion process initially from an acidic dyebath having a pH of about 3.5 to 5.5 under pH control and the pH is then, toward the end of the dyeing time, shifted into the neutral and perhaps weakly alkaline range up to a pH of 8.5 to bring about, especially for very deep dyeings, the full reactive bond between the dyes of the dye mixtures of the invention and the fiber.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the dye portion not reactively bound is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The procedure described herein also applies to the production of dyeings on fiber materials composed of other natural polyamides or of synthetic polyamides and polyurethanes.
      <br/>
      In general, the material to be dyed is introduced into the bath at a temperature of about 40 (degree)  C., agitated therein for some time, the dyebath is then adjusted to the desired weakly acidic, preferably weakly acetic acid, pH and the actual dyeing is carried out at a temperature between 60 and 98 (degree)  C. However, the dyeings can also be carried out at the boil or in sealed dyeing apparatus at temperatures of up to 106 (degree)  C. Since the water solubility of the dye mixtures of the invention is very good, they can also be used with advantage in customary continuous dyeing processes.
      <br/>
      The color strength of the dye mixtures of the invention is very high.
    </p>
    <p num="38">The dye mixtures of the invention produce bright, yellowish to bluish red dyeings on the materials mentioned, preferably fiber materials.</p>
