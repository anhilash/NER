    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates generally to a mammalian epithelium-derived T-cell factor ("ETF") polypeptide.
      <br/>
      It more particularly relates to isolated mammalian ETF polypeptide sequences and derivatives thereof, compositions containing mammalian ETF that induce T cell proliferation and differentiation, compositions containing mammalian ETF that induce B cell proliferation and secretion, compositions containing mammalian ETF that augment destruction of tumor cells or viral-infected cells, compositions containing mammalian ETF that augment anti-infectious disease immunity, and compositions containing mammalian ETF for preventing radio- and chemotherapy-induced toxicity.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      T-cells, also known as T-lymphocytes, are a class of immune effector cells.
      <br/>
      In peripheral tissues, T-cells can be divided into two broad groups based on their mutually exclusive expression of CD4 and CD8 cell surface molecules.
      <br/>
      Typical CD8+ T-cells become cytotoxic T-cells after activation and destroy antigen bearing target cells through direct cell contact.
      <br/>
      Activated CD4+ T-cells generally provide positive signals, for example, "helper" function for B cells (that engages to antibody-forming cells) and, therefore, are called helper T-cells.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Six T-cell growth factors have previously been identified: Interleukin (IL) -2, -4, -7, -9, -12 and cofactor IL-10.
      <br/>
      Each of these will be discussed in turn below.
      <br/>
      Briefly, IL-2's open reading frame codes for a 15 kDa, 153-amino acid polypeptide.
      <br/>
      IL-2 is produced by certain T-cells and by large granular lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      IL-2 was originally discovered as a factor that would support long-term growth of human T-cells.
      <br/>
      In addition to T-cell growth, its effects include activation of natural killer (NK) cells and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells as well as cytotoxic T-cells ("CTL"), macrophages and promotion of B-cell growth.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      IL-4 is a 15-20 kDa protein produced by activated T-cells, bone marrow stromal cells, and mast cells.
      <br/>
      The IL-4 open reading frame codes for 140-amino acid murine IL-4 and 153-amino acid human IL-4.
      <br/>
      Originally, IL-4 was defined as a factor that activated B-cell growth and differentiation.
      <br/>
      Its effects also include macrophage activation and induction of class II MHC molecules, growth of some T-cell and mast cell lines, proliferation and CTL generation from human peripheral blood T-cells and enhancement of immunoglobulin production by B-cells.
      <br/>
      IL-4 also acts as a cofactor in growth of hematopoietic cells from stem cells, and plays an important role in the down-regulation of IL-2 induced NK cell and LAK cell activities.
      <br/>
      Human IL-4 is not active on murine cells.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      IL-7 is a 20-25 kDa, 177 amino acid polypeptide produced by bone marrow and thymic stromal cells.
      <br/>
      Although it was originally described as a pre-B-cell growth factor, IL-7 supports the growth of pro-B-cells as well as pre-B-cells.
      <br/>
      IL-7 also induces proliferation and CTL generation from human peripheral blood T-cells, IL-2 receptor expression, IL-2 production, and proliferation in CD4+ and CD8+ cells.
      <br/>
      IL-7 also synergizes with IL-2 and increases thymic T-cell proliferation and induces proliferation of CD4- and CD8- thymocytes.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      IL-9 is a 30-40 kDa, 144 amino acid polypeptide produced by activated T-lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      IL-9 was first identified as a helper T-cell growth factor.
      <br/>
      IL-9 stimulates erythroid development and enhances IL-3 induced proliferation of bone marrow-derived mast cells.
      <br/>
      It also modulates IgE and IgG production by B-cells in the presence of IL-4.
      <br/>
      Murine IL-9 is active on human cells, whereas human IL-9 does not act on murine cells.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Human IL-10 is a 16-20 kDa, 178-amino acid polypeptide produced by macrophages and TH2 but not TH1 T-helper cells.
      <br/>
      Like IL-2, IL-4 and IL-7, IL-10 has several different biological activities.
      <br/>
      IL-10 was discovered on the basis of its ability to inhibit cytokine production by activated T-cells.
      <br/>
      Both human and murine IL-10 are growth-stimulatory cofactors for thymocytes and T-cells in combination with IL-7 or IL-2 plus IL-4.
      <br/>
      IL-10 stimulates mast cell viability and growth in combination with IL-4 or IL-3 plus IL-4.
      <br/>
      IL-10 also induces the IgG secretion and expression of MHC class II molecules on B-cells and increases their viability in culture.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      IL-12 is constitutive or induced by phorbol ester and calcium ionophore in lymphoblastoid cell lines and is produced by LPS stimulated macrophages.
      <br/>
      IL-12 has a molecular weight of 70 kDa and an unusual heterodimeric structure, being formed of two disulfide-bonded glycoproteins.
      <br/>
      The larger of the two glycoprotein subunits is a 40 kDa, 328-amino acid polypeptide.
      <br/>
      The smaller glycoprotein subunit is a 35 kDa, 253-amino acid polypeptide.
      <br/>
      Both glycoprotein subunits are necessary for bioactivity.
      <br/>
      IL-12 induces the proliferation of activated T-cells of both the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets independently of IL-2.
      <br/>
      IL-12 also activates NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity and synergizes with IL-2 to generate LAK cells.
      <br/>
      Unlike IL-2 and IL-7, but similar to IL-4, IL-12 causes little or no proliferation of resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The present invention provides a new, previously unidentified T-cell growth factor, designated "Epithelium-derived T-cell Factor" ("ETF"), and further provides other related advantages.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      "Epithelium-derived T-cell factor" or "ETF" refers to mammalian polypeptides that are structurally similar to the polypeptides disclosed herein (including allelic variants) and that stimulate T-lymphocytes to proliferate and differentiate.
      <br/>
      ETF is distinguishable from IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-12 in structure and cellular origin (see Table 1).
      <br/>
      In primates, ETF polypeptide is initially produced by epithelial cells as a 162-amino acid precursor ETF polypeptide.
      <br/>
      This precursor contains a 48-amino acid leader sequence that is removed from the precursor polypeptide to form the mature polypeptide.
      <br/>
      The mature ETF polypeptide is capable of signaling proliferation and/or differentiation of precursor or mature T-cells.
      <br/>
      The protein, therefore, can be used to promote long-term in vitro culture of T-lymphocytes and T-cell lines.

    <p num="18">
      "sEFT" refers to a simian species of ETF. "hETF" refers to a human species of ETF. "rETF" refers to recombinant ETF.
      <br/>
      Both purified sETF and rETF will stimulate proliferation of CTLL-2 cells (Gillis and Smith, Nature 268:154 (1977); ATCC TIB 214).
      <br/>
      Briefly, in the CTLL-2 proliferation assays, supernatants of cells transfected with recombinantly expressed precursor and inframe fusions of mature forms of sETF induced CTLL-2 cell proliferation.
      <br/>
      For other assays, peripheral blood T-cells ("PBT") and peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes ("PBL") were isolated from human peripheral blood. rETF was found to stimulate proliferation of PBT and PBL previously cultured with phytohemagglutinin ("PHA"). rETF also stimulated proliferation of PHA activated CD44, and CD8+ cells. rETF stimulated proliferation of resting human T-cells or resting murine T-cell clones in the presence of anti-CD3 (T-cell receptor) antibodies.
      <br/>
      Experiments with PHA activated PBT demonstrate that rETF exerts its growth stimulatory effects independently of IL-2, in that antibodies to IL-2 or to the IL-2 receptor do not inhibit ETF.
    </p>
    <p num="19">The terms ETF, sETF and hETF include analogs or subunits of native mammalian polypeptides that are encoded by nucleotide sequences that hybridize, under moderate to high stringency conditions, to probes defined by nucleotides 145 through 486 of SEQ ID NOS 1 or 4 or to their complementary DNA or RNA strands, and that code on expression for polypeptides that stimulate proliferation and differentiation of T-lymphocytes, and stimulate proliferation of T-cell lines and isolated PBT.</p>
    <p num="20">
      "Recombinant DNA technology" or "recombinant", as used herein, refers to techniques and processes for producing specific polypeptides from microbial (e.g., bacterial, fungal or yeast) or mammalian cells or organisms (e.g., transgenics) that have been transformed or transfected with cloned or synthetic DNA sequences to enable biosynthesis of heterologous peptides.
      <br/>
      Native glycosylation patterns will only be achieved with mammalian cell expression systems.
      <br/>
      Yeast provide a distinctive glycosylation pattern.
      <br/>
      Prokaryotic cell expression (e.g., E. coli) will generally produce polypeptides without glycosylation.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      "Biologically active" means that a particular mammalian ETF polypeptide is capable of stimulating T-lymphocyte proliferation and/or differentiation.
      <br/>
      In the case of sETF and hETF, this biological activity also corresponds to stimulation of the proliferation of murine or primate, for example, human, T-cell lines or PBT.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A "nucleotide sequence" refers to a polynucleotide molecule in the form of a separate fragment or as a component of a larger nucleic acid construct, that has been derived from DNA or RNA isolated at least once in substantially pure form (i.e., free of contaminating endogenous materials) and in a quantity or concentration enabling identification, manipulation, and recovery of its component nucleotide sequences by standard biochemical methods (such as those outlined in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)).
      <br/>
      Such sequences are preferably provided in the form of an open reading frame uninterrupted by internal nontranslated sequences, or introns, that are typically present in eukaryotic genes.
      <br/>
      Sequences of non-translated DNA may be present 5' or 3' from an open reading frame, where the same do not interfere with manipulation or expression of the coding regions.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      "Recombinant expression vector" refers to a plasmid comprising a transcriptional unit comprising an assembly of (1) a genetic element or elements having a regulatory role in gene expression, for example, promoters or enhancers, (2) a structural or coding sequence that encodes ETF biological activity, and if desired, (3) appropriate transcription and translation initiation and termination sequences.
      <br/>
      Representative examples of various regulatory elements that can be used are discussed below (see Recombinant DNA Techniques).
      <br/>
      Structural elements intended for use in yeast expression systems preferably include a leader sequence enabling extracellular secretion of translated polypeptide by a yeast host cell.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, in a bacterial expression system, the recombinant polypeptide may include a N-terminal methionine residue.
      <br/>
      The N-terminal methionine residue may be subsequently cleaved from the expressed recombinant polypeptide to provide a product suitable for further purification.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      "Recombinant microbial expression system" refers to a substantially homogeneous monoculture of suitable host microorganisms, for example, bacteria, such as E. coli, or yeast, such as S. cerevisiae, that have stably integrated a recombinant transcriptional unit into chromosomal DNA or carry the recombinant transcriptional unit as a component of a resident plasmid.
      <br/>
      Generally, host cells constituting a recombinant microbial expression system are the progeny of a single ancestral transformed cell.
      <br/>
      Recombinant microbial expression systems will express heterologous polypeptides upon induction of the regulatory elements linked to a structural nucleotide sequence to be expressed.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Transformed host cells are cells that have been transformed or transfected with a recombinant expression vector.
      <br/>
      Expressed mammalian ETF will be located within the host cell and/or secreted into culture supernatant, depending upon the nature of the host cell and the gene construct inserted into the host cell.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Moderate stringency hybridization conditions, as defined herein and as known to those skilled in the art, refer to conditions described in, for example, Sambrook et al., supra, Vol. 2, pp. 8.46-8.49 and 9.47-9.55. Conditions of moderate stringency, as defined by Sambrook et al. include, for example, overnight hybridization and post-hybridization washes at 55 (degree)  C., 5 * SSC, 0.5% SDS. Severe or high stringency conditions include higher temperatures of hybridization and post-hybridization washes, or lower salt concentrations.</p>
    <p num="27">ETF Polypeptides</p>
    <p num="28">
      As described in more detail below, a simian species of ETF (sETF) has been purified, and the N-terminus sequenced.
      <br/>
      Using the N-terminal amino acid sequence and PCR, cDNA encoding sETF was isolated, and utilized to determine the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of mature sETF (FIG. 1), and the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of a precursor of sETF polypeptide (SEQ ID NO 1 and SEQ ID NO 2).
      <br/>
      Precursor ETF polypeptide sequence in the simian species comprises a mature active protein (SEQ ID NO 3) preceded by a 48-amino acid leader sequence.
      <br/>
      The leader sequence is amino acids 1-48 of SEQ ID NO 2.
      <br/>
      Primate ETF stimulates in a statistically significant manner the proliferation of murine T-cell lines (e.g., CTLL-2) and the proliferation and differentiation of human PBT cells.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The present invention also comprises other mammalian ETF, including human ETF, having ETF biological activity and encoded by nucleotide sequences that hybridize, under conditions of moderate to high stringency, to probes defined by SEQ ID NO 1, SEQ ID NO 4, and SEQ ID NO 12.
      <br/>
      A plasmid containing a recombinant clone of human ETF cDNA was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville Md. 20852 USA ("ATCC") in accordance with the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure on Feb. 19, 1993 under accession number ATCC 69245.
      <br/>
      The deposit was named "I41-hETF" and comprised an E. coli strain containing plasmid hETF/pDC' that contained a 316-bp 5' noncoding region preceding an open reading frame of 486 bp and a 400-bp 3' noncoding region flanked by the Sal I adapters shown in SEQ ID NOS 7 and 8.
      <br/>
      All restrictions on the availability to the public of the material deposited will be irrevocably removed upon the granting of a patent.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The amino acid structure of ETF polypeptides disclosed herein may be modified by forming covalent or aggregative conjugates with other chemical moieties, such as glycosyl groups, lipids, phosphate, acetyl groups and the like, or by creating amino acid sequence mutants.
      <br/>
      Covalent derivatives of mammalian ETF are prepared by linking particular functional groups to mammalian ETF amino acid side chains or at the N-terminus or C-terminus of a mammalian ETF polypeptide.
      <br/>
      Other derivatives of mammalian ETF within the scope of this invention include covalent or aggregative conjugates of mammalian ETF or its fragments with other proteins or polypeptides, such as by synthesis in recombinant culture as N-terminal or C-terminal fusions.
      <br/>
      For example, the conjugated polypeptide may be a signal (or leader) polypeptide sequence at the N-terminal region of a mammalian ETF polypeptide for transport from its site of synthesis to a site inside or outside of the cell membrane or wall (e.g., the yeast  ALPHA -factor leader).
      <br/>
      Further, using conventional techniques, ETF polypeptides can be expressed as polypeptide fusions comprising additional polypeptide sequences, such as Fc or other immunoglobulin sequences, linker sequences, or other sequences that facilitate purification and identification of ETF polypeptides.
      <br/>
      Still further, ETF polypeptide fusions can comprise fusions with other cytokines to provide novel polyfunctional entities.
      <br/>
      Other cytokines include, for example, any of interleukins-1 through 13, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), mast cell growth factor (MGF) and other cytokines that affect immune cell growth, differentiation or function.
      <br/>
      Within a particularly preferred embodiment, ETF may be fused in frame to IL-2 (or a biologically active portion of IL-2) in order to provide an IL-2/ETF fusion protein.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The present invention further includes ETF polypeptides having altered glycosylation.
      <br/>
      Briefly, ETF polypeptides expressed in yeast or mammalian expression systems (e.g., COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL 1651)) may be similar or significantly different in molecular weight and glycosylation pattern than a native ETF polypeptide.
      <br/>
      This depends upon the choice of expression system.
      <br/>
      Expression of ETF polypeptides in bacterial expression systems, such as E. coli, provide non-glycosylated molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Functional mutant analogs of human or other mammalian ETF can be synthesized, for example, with inactivated N-glycosylation sites by oligonucleotide synthesis and ligation or by site-specific mutagenesis techniques.
      <br/>
      ETF polypeptide derivatives can be expressed in homogeneous, reduced carbohydrate form using yeast expression systems. N-glycosylation sites in eukaryotic polypeptides are characterized by an amino acid triplet ASN- PHI - OMEGA , where  PHI  is any amino acid except Pro and  OMEGA is Ser or Thr.
      <br/>
      An ETF mutant derivative, as referred to herein, is a polypeptide substantially homologous to a sequence of a native mammalian ETF but that has an amino acid sequence different from a native mammalian ETF polypeptide because of a deletion, insertion or substitution.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Bioequivalent analogs of ETF polypeptides or ETF muteins may be constructed by making various substitutions of amino acid residues or sequences, or by deleting terminal or internal residues or sequences not needed for biological activity.
      <br/>
      For example, Cys residues can be deleted or replaced with other amino acids to prevent formation of incorrect intramolecular disulfide bridges upon renaturation.
      <br/>
      Other approaches to mutagenesis involve modification of dibasic amino acid residues to enhance expression in yeast systems in which KEX2 protease activity is present.
      <br/>
      Generally, substitutions are made conservatively by substituting an amino acid having physiochemical characteristics resembling those of the native residue.

    <p num="34">
      Antisense or sense oligonucleotides comprise single-stranded nucleic acid sequences (either RNA or DNA) capable of binding to sense ETF mRNA or antisense ETF cDNA sequences.
      <br/>
      An antisense or sense oligonucleotide, according to the present invention, comprises a fragment of the nucleotide sequences in FIGS. 1 or 2 or a DNA or RNA complement of the nucleotide sequences in FIGS. 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      Such a fragment comprises at least about 14 nucleotides and is capable of binding to ETF DNA.
      <br/>
      The ability to create an antisense or a sense oligonucleotide, based upon a cDNA sequence for ETF is described in, for example, Stein and Cohen, Cancer Res. 48:2659 (1988), and van der Krol et al., BioTechniques 6:958 (1988).

      Isolation and characterization of ETF from non-recombinant cellular sources requires a mammalian cell line that produces ETF and a responder cell line that proliferates in response to ETF stimulation.

      One can utilize the simian or human ETF cDNA sequences disclosed herein to obtain cDNAs encoding other mammalian homologs of simian or human ETF by cross-species hybridization techniques.

      Briefly, an oligonucleotide probe may be created based upon the nucleotide sequence of the protein coding region of sETF cDNA as described in FIG. 1 or SEQ ID NO 1 or hETF cDNA as described in FIG. 2 or SEQ ID NO 4.
      <br/>
      This probe can be made by standard techniques, such as those described in Sambrock et al. supra.
      <br/>
      The simian or human probe is used to screen a mammalian cDNA library or genomic DNA library under moderate stringency conditions.
      <br/>
      Mammalian cDNA libraries can be made from mRNAs isolated from, for example, murine peripheral blood lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, other cDNA libraries or mRNAs isolated from various tissues or cell lines can be screened by Northern hybridization to determine a suitable source of mammalian ETF DNA or mRNA.

    <p num="38">CV-1/EBNA ETF Purification</p>
    <p num="39">
      As described in more detail below, ETF has been purified from a non-homogeneous protein solution, such as conditioned medium collected from cells expressing ETF, to provide an isolated polypeptide preparation.
      <br/>
      ETF activity in crude conditioned medium samples is not always detectable using currently available ETF bioassay techniques.
      <br/>
      At least one purification step is typically required before ETF biological activity is detectable utilizing bioassay techniques described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      A non-homogeneous protein solution, e.g., conditioned medium, is prepared by growing the CV-1/EBNA line (C. J. McMahan et al., EMBO J., 10(10):2821-2832 (1991); ATCC CRL 10478) of African Green Monkey kidney cells in a tissue culture medium.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the medium is high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium ("DMEM", Gibco, Grand Island, N.Y.).
      <br/>
      Most preferably, a growth medium and a production medium are used.
      <br/>
      The growth medium employed in isolating sETF as described herein was high glucose (4500 mg/L) DMEM supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 50 u/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, 3 to 4.0 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids and 10 mM N-�2-hydroxyethyl�piperazine-N'-�2-ethanesulfonic acid� ("HEPES") buffer.
      <br/>
      A serum free production medium of DMEM without phenol red supplemented with 50 u/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, 3 to 4.0 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids and 10 mM HEPES buffer was developed for ETF production and purification.
      <br/>
      The CV-1/EBNA cells were attachment dependent and could be grown in dishes, flasks, roller bottles or microcarriers.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      More specifically, ETF was produced by culturing CV-1/EBNA cells on microcarriers in a controlled bioreactor.
      <br/>
      Cell stocks were maintained in roller bottle flasks.
      <br/>
      To start a production cycle, cells were trypsinized and inoculated into a spinner flask containing the growth medium described above and 5 g/l Cytodex.RTM. 3 microcarriers (Pharmacia).
      <br/>
      Initial seeding density ranged from 1.5 to 3.5 * 105 cells/ml.
      <br/>
      To ensure efficient cell attachment to the microcarriers, the cells were kept in the spinner flask for 2 to 24 hours.
      <br/>
      Spinner flask cultures were incubated at 37 (degree)  C. and agitated at 25 to 40 RPM.
      <br/>
      After the attachment period, the culture was transferred to a controlled bioreactor.
      <br/>
      Bioreactor temperature, pH, oxygen and agitation set points were 37 (degree)  C., 7.0, 20% saturation (relative to air), and 75-85 RPM, respectively.
      <br/>
      For routine observation of cell growth and health, samples were observed by bright field microscopy.
      <br/>
      Quantification of cell growth was achieved by counting released nuclei after treatment with a solution of 100 mM citric acid and 0.1% crystal violet.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The culture was supplemented with additional growth medium when ammonia levels reached 5.0 mM. This was repeated until the microcarriers were confluent.
      <br/>
      The culture medium was then exchanged to the serum-free production medium described above.
      <br/>
      This procedure was accomplished by allowing the microcarriers to settle to the bottom of the reactor, aspirating the growth medium and replacing it with production medium.
      <br/>
      This was repeated until an approximately 3,125 fold dilution was achieved.
      <br/>
      Two to six rounds of production can be expected.
      <br/>
      In each round, cells were allowed to produce for four to seven days after which 80% of the production medium was collected.

      Approximately 64 liters of CV-1/EBNA conditioned media were used to purify and provide protein for the N-terminal amino acid sequence of sETF.

    <p num="44">Recombinant DNA Techniques</p>
    <p num="45">
      Human, simian and other mammalian ETF polypeptides are preferably produced by recombinant DNA techniques.
      <br/>
      Generally, such techniques involve insertion of cDNA encoding a human or other mammalian ETF polypeptide or a derivative thereof into an expression vector, transfecting or transforming a host cell with the expression vector, and culturing the cell under conditions which promote expression of the ETF polypeptide.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Briefly, recombinant production of mammalian ETF polypeptides or derivatives thereof first requires isolation of a DNA clone (i.e., cDNA) that codes on expression for a mammalian ETF polypeptide or a derivative thereof. cDNA clones are derived from primary cells or cell lines that express mammalian ETF polypeptides.
      <br/>
      First total cell mRNA is isolated, then a cDNA library is made from the mRNA by reverse transcription.
      <br/>
      A cDNA clone may be isolated and identified using the DNA sequence information provided herein to design a cross-species hybridization probe or PCR primer as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The isolated cDNA is preferably in the form of an open reading frame uninterrupted by internal nontranslated sequences, or introns.
      <br/>
      Genomic DNA containing the relevant nucleotide sequences that code for expression of mammalian ETF polypeptides can also be used as a source of genetic information useful in constructing coding sequences.
      <br/>
      The isolated cDNA can be mutated by techniques known in the art to promote ETF derivatives or analogs that exhibit ETF biological activity.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Recombinant expression vectors include synthetic or cDNA-derived nucleic acid fragments encoding ETF or biologically active derivatives thereof.
      <br/>
      The nucleic acid fragment which encodes ETF or a derivative thereof is operably linked to a suitable transcriptional or translational regulatory or structural nucleotide sequence, such as one derived from mammalian, microbial, viral, insect, or plant genes.
      <br/>
      Examples of regulatory sequences include, for example, a genetic sequence having a regulatory role in gene expression (e.g., transcriptional promoters or enhancers), an optional operator sequence to control transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites, and appropriate sequences that control transcription and translation initiation and termination.
      <br/>
      Nucleotide sequences are operably linked when the regulatory sequence functionally relates to the structural gene.
      <br/>
      For example, a DNA sequence for a signal peptide (secretory leader) may be operably linked to a structural gene DNA sequence for a mammalian ETF or derivative thereof if the signal peptide is expressed as part of a precursor amino acid sequence and participates in the secretion of a mammalian ETF.
      <br/>
      Further, a promoter nucleotide sequence is operably linked to a coding sequence (e.g., structural gene DNA) if the promoter nucleotide sequence controls the transcription of the structural gene nucleotide sequence.
      <br/>
      Still further, a ribosome binding site may be operably linked to a structural gene nucleotide coding sequence (e.g., mammalian ETF) if the ribosome binding site is positioned within the vector to encourage translation.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Suitable host cells for expression of mammalian ETF or derivatives thereof include prokaryotes, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells under the control of appropriate promoters.
      <br/>
      Prokaryotes include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for example E. coli or bacilli.
      <br/>
      Suitable prokaryotic hosts cells for transformation include, for example, E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, and various other species within the genera Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, and Staphylococcus.
      <br/>
      As discussed in greater detail below, examples of suitable host cells also include yeast such as S. cerevisiae, a mammalian cell line such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or insect cells.

      Cell-free translation systems could also be employed to produce mammalian ETF or derivatives thereof using RNAs derived from the DNA constructs disclosed herein.

      Yeast vectors will often contain an origin of replication sequence from a 2  MU  yeast plasmid, an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS), a promoter region, sequences for polyadenylation, and sequences for transcription termination.
      <br/>
      Preferably, yeast vectors include an origin of replication sequence and selectable marker.

Enzyme Reg. 7:149, 1968; and Holland et al., Biochem. 17:4900, 1978), such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase.

      The ADH2 promoter has been described by Russell et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 258:2674, 1982) and Beier et al. (Nature 300:724,1982).
      <br/>
      The yeast  ALPHA -factor leader sequence directs secretion of heterologous polypeptides.
      <br/>
      The  ALPHA -factor leader sequence is often inserted between the promoter sequence and the structural gene sequence.

      See, e.g., Kurjan et al., Cell 30:933, 1982; and Bitter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:5330, 1984.
      <br/>
      A leader sequence may be modified near its 3' end to contain one or more restriction sites.

      <br/>
      The Hinnen et al. protocol selects for Trp+ transformants in a selective medium, wherein the selective medium consists of 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% casamino acids, 2% glucose, 10 mg/ml adenine and 20 mg/ml uracil.

      <br/>
      A phenotypic selectable marker is, for example, a gene encoding proteins that confer antibiotic resistance or that supply an autotrophic requirement, and an origin of replication recognized by the host to ensure amplification within the host.
      <br/>
      Other useful expression vectors for prokaryotic host cells include a selectable marker of bacterial origin derived from commercially available plasmids.
      <br/>
      This selectable marker can comprise genetic elements of the cloning vector pBR322 (ATCC 37017). pBR322 contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance and thus provides simple means for identifying transformed cells.
      <br/>
      The pBR322 "backbone" sections are combined with an appropriate promoter and a mammalian ETF structural gene sequence.

      Mammalian or insect host cell culture systems can also be employed to express recombinant mammalian ETF polypeptide or derivatives thereof.

      <br/>
      Suitable mammalian expression vectors include nontranscribed elements such as an origin of replication, a promoter sequence, an enhancer linked to the structural gene, other 5' or 3' flanking nontranscribed sequences, such as ribosome binding sites, a polyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, and transcriptional termination sequences.

      DNA sequences derived from the SV40 viral genome, for example, SV40 origin, early and late promoter, enhancer, splice, and polyadenylation sites may be used to provide the other genetic elements required for expression of a structural gene sequence in a mammalian host cell.
      <br/>
      Viral early and late promoters are particularly useful because both are easily obtained from a viral genome as a fragment that may also contain a viral origin of replication (Fiers et al., Nature 273:113, 1978).

    <p num="68">
      Within one aspect of the present invention, ETF, including derivatives thereof, as well as portions or fragments of these proteins such as the ETF peptides, may be utilized to prepare antibodies which specifically bind to ETF.
      <br/>
      Within the context of the present invention the term "antibodies" should be understood to include polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, fragments thereof such as F(ab')2 and Fab fragments, as well as recombinantly produced binding partners.
      <br/>
      Antibodies are defined to be specifically binding if they bind to the ETF with a Ka of greater than or equal to about 107 M-1.
      <br/>
      The affinity of a monoclonal antibody or binding partner may be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art (see Scatchard, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 51:660-672, 1949).
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Polyclonal antibodies may be readily generated by one of ordinary skill in the art from a variety of warm-blooded animals such as horses, cows, goats, sheep, dogs, chickens, rabbits, mice, or rats, given the disclosure provided herein.
      <br/>
      Briefly, ETF is utilized to immunize the animal through intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intraocular, or subcutaneous injections.
      <br/>
      The immunogenicity of a ETF or ETF peptide may be increased through the use of an adjuvant such as Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant.
      <br/>
      Following several booster immunizations, small samples of serum are collected and tested for reactivity to the ETF.
      <br/>
      A variety of assays may be utilized in order to detect antibodies which specifically bind to a ETF.
      <br/>
      Exemplary assays are described in detail in Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Lane (eds.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988.
      <br/>
      Representative examples of such assays include: Countercurrent Immuno-Electrophoresis (CIEP), Radioimmunoassays, Radioimmunoprecipitations, Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assays (ELISA), Dot Blot assays, and sandwich assays (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,376,110 and 4,486,530; see also Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, supra).
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred polyclonal antisera will give a signal that is at least three times greater than background.
      <br/>
      Once the titer of the animal has reached a plateau in terms of its reactivity to the ETF, larger quantities of polyclonal antisera may be readily obtained either by weekly bleedings, or by exsanguinating the animal.

    <p num="70">
      Monoclonal antibodies may also be readily generated using well-known techniques (see U.S. Pat. Nos. RE 32,011, 4,902,614, 4,543,439, and 4,411,993; see also Monoclonal Antibodies, Hybridomas: A New Dimension in Biological Analyses, Plenum Press, Kennett, McKearn, and Bechtol (eds.), 1980, and Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Lane (eds.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988).

      Briefly, within one embodiment a subject animal such as a rat or mouse is injected with a form of ETF suitable for generating an immune response against the ETF.
      <br/>
      Representative examples of suitable forms include, among others, cells which express ETF, or peptides which are based upon the ETF sequence.
      <br/>
      Additionally, many techniques are known in the art for increasing the resultant immune response, for example, by coupling ETF or ETF peptides to another protein such as ovalbumin or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), or through the use of adjuvants such as Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant.
      <br/>
      The initial immunization may be through intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intraocular, or subcutaneous routes.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Between one and three weeks after the initial immunization the animal may be reimmunized with another booster immunization.
      <br/>
      The animal may then be test bled and the serum tested for binding to the ETF using assays as described above.
      <br/>
      Additional immunizations may also be accomplished until the animal has plateaued in its reactivity to the ETF.
      <br/>
      The animal may then be given a final boost of ETF or ETF peptide, and three to four days later sacrificed.
      <br/>
      At this time, the spleen and lymph nodes may be harvested and disrupted into a single cell suspension by passing the organs through a mesh screen or by rupturing the spleen or lymph node membranes which encapsidate the cells.
      <br/>
      Within one embodiment the red cells are subsequently lysed by the addition of a hypotonic solution, followed by immediate return to isotonicity.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Within another embodiment, suitable cells for preparing monoclonal antibodies are obtained through the use of in vitro immunization techniques.
      <br/>
      Briefly, an animal is sacrificed, and the spleen and lymph node cells are removed as described above.
      <br/>
      A single cell suspension is prepared, and the cells are placed into a culture containing a form of the ETF that is suitable for generating an immune response as described above.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the lymphocytes are harvested and fused as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="73">

      <br/>
      Alternatively, within a preferred embodiment, the harvested spleen and/or lymph node cell suspensions are fused with a suitable myeloma cell in order to create a "hybridoma" which secretes monoclonal antibodies.

      <br/>
      Particularly preferred fusion lines include NS-1 (ATCC No. TIB 18) and P3X63 - Ag 8.653 (ATCC No. CRL 1580), which may be utilized for fusions with either mouse, rat, or human cell lines.
      <br/>
      Fusion between the myeloma cell line and the cells from the immunized animal may be accomplished by a variety of methods, including the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) (see Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Lane (eds.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988) or electrofusion (see Zimmerman and Vienken, J. Membrane Biol. 67:165-182, 1982).

    <p num="74">
      Following fusion, the cells are placed into culture plates containing a suitable medium, such as RPMI 1640 or DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium) (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, Kans.).

      The medium may also contain additional ingredients, such as Fetal Bovine Serum ("FEBS," i.e., from Hyclone, Logan, Utah, or JRH Biosciences), thymocytes which were harvested from a baby animal of the same species as was used for immunization, or agar to solidify the medium.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the medium should contain a reagent which selectively allows for the growth of fused spleen and myeloma cells.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred is the use of HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. ).
      <br/>
      After about seven days, the resulting fused cells or hybridomas may be screened in order to determine the presence of antibodies which recognize the ETF.
      <br/>
      Following several clonal dilutions and reassays, a hybridoma producing antibodies which bind to ETF may be isolated.

      The construction of these proteins may be readily accomplished by one of ordinary skill in the art (see Larrick et al., "Polymerase Chain Reaction Using Mixed Primers: Cloning of Human Monoclonal Antibody Variable Region Genes From Single Hybridoma Cells," Biotechnology 7:934-938, September 1989; Riechmann et al., "Reshaping Human Antibodies for Therapy," Nature 332:323-327, 1988; Roberts et al., "Generation of an Antibody with Enhanced Affinity and Specificity of its Antigen by Protein Engineering," Nature 328:731-734, 1987; Verhoeyen et al., "reshaping Human Antibodies: Grafting an Antilysozyme Activity," Science 239:1534-1536, 1988; Chaudhary et al, "a Recombinant Immunotoxin Consisting of Two Antibody Variable Domains Fused to Pseudomonas Exotoxin," Nature 339:394-397, 1989; see also,U.S. Pat. No. 5,132,405 entitled "Biosynthetic Antibody Binding Sites"), given the disclosure provided herein.
      <br/>
      Briefly, within one embodiment, DNA molecules encoding ETF-specific antigen binding domains are amplified from hybridomas which produce a specifically binding monoclonal antibody, and inserted directly into the genome of a cell which produces human antibodies (see Verhoeyen et al., supra; see also Reichmann et al., supra).
      <br/>
      This technique allows the antigen-binding site of a specifically binding mouse or rat monoclonal antibody to be transferred into a human antibody.
      <br/>
      Such antibodies are preferable for therapeutic use in humans because they are not as antigenic as rat or mouse antibodies.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Alternatively, the antigen-binding sites (variable region) may be either linked to, or inserted into, another completely different protein (see Chaudhary et al., supra), resulting in a new protein with antigen-binding sites of the antibody as well as the functional activity of the completely different protein.
      <br/>
      As one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, the antigen-binding sites or ETF binding domain of the antibody may be found in the variable region of the antibody.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, DNA sequences which encode smaller portions of the anitbody or variable regions which specifically bind to mammalian ETF may also be utilized within the context of the present invention.
      <br/>
      These portions may be readily tested for binding specificity to the ETF utilizing assays described below.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      Within a preferred embodiment, genes which encode the variable region from a hybridoma producing a monoclonal antibody of interest are amplified using oligonucleotide primers for the variable region.
      <br/>
      These primers may be synthesized by one of ordinary skill in the art, or may be purchased from commercially available sources.
      <br/>
      Stratacyte (La Jolla, Calif.) sells primers for mouse and human variable regions including, among others, primers for VHa, VHb, VHc, VHd, CH1, VL and CL regions.
      <br/>
      These primers may be utilized to amplify heavy or light chain variable regions, which may then be inserted into vectors such as IMMUNOZAP*(H) or IMMUNOZAP*(L) (Stratacyte), respectively.
      <br/>
      These vectors may then be introduced into E. coli for expression.
      <br/>
      Utilizing these techniques, large amounts of a single-chain protein containing a fusion of the VH and VL domains may be produced (see Bird et al., Science 242:423-426, 1988).
    </p>
    <p num="80">Other "antibodies" which may also be prepared utilizing the disclosure provided herein, and thus which are also deemed to fall within the scope of the present invention include humanized antibodies (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 and WO 94/10332), microbodies (e.g., WO 94/09817) and transgenic antibodies (e.g., GB 2 272 440).</p>
    <p num="81">
      Once suitable antibodies have been obtained, they may be isolated or purified by many techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, supra).
      <br/>
      Suitable techniques include ammonium sulfate precipitation, peptide or protein affinity columns, HPLC or RP-HPLC, purification on protein A or protein G columns, or any combination of these techniques.
      <br/>
      Within the context of the present invention, the term "isolated" as used to define antibodies means "substantially free of other blood components."

      <br/>
      For example, within one embodiment immobilized anti-ETF antibody may be incubated with a sample (e.g., a biological sample such as serum) suspected of containing ETF, under conditions and for a time sufficient to permit binding of the immobilized antibody to ETF.
      <br/>
      Several washings may then be accomplished in order to remove non-binding constituents, followed by the addition of a labeled antibody which also recognizes ETF.
      <br/>
      After several additional washing steps, detection of the labeled antibody may be accomplished in order to determine the presence of ETF in the original sample.

    <heading>DIAGNOSTIC USE OF ETF SEQUENCES</heading>
    <p num="89">
      Within another aspect of the present invention, probes and primers are provided for detecting ETF.
      <br/>
      Within one embodiment of the invention, probes are provided which are capable of hybridizing to ETF DNA or RNA.
      <br/>
      For purposes of the present invention, probes are "capable of hybridizing" to ETF DNA if they hybridize to Sequence I.D. Nos. 1 to 4 (or their complementary sequences) under conditions of moderate or high stringency (see Sambrook et al., supra).
    </p>
    <p num="90">Probes of the present invention may be composed of either deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) ribonucleic acids (RNA), nucleic acid analogues, or any combination of these, and may be as few as about 12 nucleotides in length, usually about 14 to 18 nucleotides in length, and possibly as large as the entire sequence of the ETF.</p>
    <p num="91">
      Probes may be constructed and labeled using techniques which are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Shorter probes of, for example, 12 or 14 bases may be generated synthetically.
      <br/>
      Longer probes of about 75 bases are preferably generated by, for example, PCR amplification in the presence of labeled precursors such as 32 P-dCTP, digoxigenin-dUTP, or biotin-dATP.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Probes may be labeled by a variety of markers, including, for example, radioactive markers, fluorescent markers, enzymatic markers, and chromogenic markers.
      <br/>
      The use of 32 P is particularly preferred for marking or labeling a particular probe.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Probes of the present invention may also be utilized to detect the presence of a ETF mRNA or DNA within a sample.
      <br/>
      However, if ETF in RNA or DNA is present in only a limited amount, or if it is desired to detect a selected mutant sequence which is present in only a limited number, or if it is desired to clone ETF from a selected warm-blooded animal, then it may be beneficial to amplify the relevant sequence such that it may be more readily detected or obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="94">A variety of methods may be utilized in order to amplify a selected sequence, including, for example, RNA amplification (see Lizardi et al., Bio/Technology 6:1197-1202, 1988; Kramer et al., Nature 339:401-402, 1989; Lomeli et al., Clinical Chem. 35(9):1826-1831, 1989; U.S. Pat. No. 4,786,600), and DNA amplification utilizing Polymerase Chain Reaction ("PCR") (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195, 4,683,202, and 4,800,159) (see also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,876,187, and 5,011,769, which describe an alternative detection/amplification system comprising the use of scissile linkages).</p>
    <p num="95">
      Within a particularly preferred embodiment, PCR amplification is utilized to detect or obtain a ETF DNA.
      <br/>
      Briefly, as described in greater detail below, a DNA sample is denatured at 95 (degree)  C. in order to generate single stranded DNA.
      <br/>
      Specific primers, as discussed below, are then annealed at 37 (degree)  C. to 70 (degree)  C., depending on the proportion of AT/GC in the primers.
      <br/>
      The primers are extended at 72 (degree)  C. with Taq polymerase in order to generate the opposite strand to the template.
      <br/>
      These steps constitute one cycle, which may be repeated in order to amplify the selected sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      Primers for the amplification of a selected sequence should be selected from sequences which are highly specific and form stable duplexes with the target sequence.
      <br/>
      The primers should also be non-complementary, especially at the 3' end, should not form dimers with themselves or other primers, and should not form secondary structures or duplexes with other regions of DNA.
      <br/>
      In general, primers of about 18 to 20 nucleotides are preferred, and may be easily synthesized using techniques well known in the art.

    <p num="97">Administration of Mammalian ETF Polypeptide and Derivative Compositions</p>
    <p num="98">
      The present invention provides methods of using therapeutic compositions comprising an effective amount of ETF or nucleic acids which encode ETF in a suitable diluent or carrier.
      <br/>
      For therapeutic use, purified ETF or a biologically active derivative thereof, or nucleic acids which encode ETF, may be administered to a patient, preferably a human, for treatment in a manner appropriate to the indication.
      <br/>
      Representative examples of suitable routes for administration include intravenous injection or infusion, subcutaneous injection, inhalation, parenteral or intraperitoneal infusion, via a sustained release implant, transdermally, intra-nasally, intra-ocularly, mucosally, rectally and topically.
      <br/>
      Typically, an ETF therapeutic agent will be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising purified polypeptide in conjunction with physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents.
      <br/>
      Such carriers will be nontoxic to patients at the dosages and concentrations employed.
      <br/>
      Ordinarily, the preparation of such compositions entails combining a mammalian ETF polypeptide or derivative thereof with buffers, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides, proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates including glucose, sucrose or dextrans, chelating agents such as EDTA, glutathione and other stabilizers and excipients.
      <br/>
      Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with conspecific serum albumin are exemplary appropriate diluents.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      Within one aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for treating or preventing gastrointestinal diseases, comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of ETF.
      <br/>
      Briefly, a wide variety of diseases are associated with disruption of the gastrointestinal epithelium or villi, including chemotherapy- and radiation-therapy-induced enteritis (i.e., gut toxicity) and mucositis, peptic ulcer disease, gastronenteritis and colitis, villus atrophic disorders, malignancy, and inflammatory bowel disease.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      For example, chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy used in bone marrow transplantation and cancer therapy affect rapidly proliferating cells in both the hematopoietic tissues and small intestine, leading to severe and often dose-limiting toxicities.
      <br/>
      Damage to the small intestine mucosal barrier results in serious complications of bleeding and sepsis due to gastrointestinal flora entering the blood.
      <br/>
      Colony stimulating factors that promote proliferation of hematopoietic cells have allowed dose-intensification in chemotherapy and therefore gut toxicity has emerged as a potential dose limiting toxicity.
      <br/>
      A growth factor such as ETF that promotes proliferation and/or protection of the gastrointestinal epithelium therefore may be utilized to increase the tolerated doses for radiation therapy and chemotherapy agents which are dose limited by gastrointestinal toxicity (e.g., 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), high dose VP-16, or topetecan).
    </p>
    <p num="101">Effective treatment of gastrointestinal diseases may be determined by several criteria, including an enteritis score (based upon a composite score of clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramping, stool guaiac and diarrhea), as well as related endpoints such as percent chemotherapy dose delivered, days of hospitalization, transfusions, intravenous fluid therapy, antimotility agents, ability to eat and quality of life.</p>
    <p num="102">
      Within another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for treating HIV and HIV-associated diseases, comprising administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of ETF.
      <br/>
      Briefly, as noted above, ETF has been shown to stimulate both CD4 /  and CD8+ cells, and therefore, may be administered (with or without additional therapies such as an antiretroviral therapy regimen) to a patient in order to positively effect the course of disease.
      <br/>
      Effective treatment of HIV and HIV-associated diseases may be determined by several criteria, including for example CD4+ cell count, progression of disease and quantitation of HIV.
    </p>
    <p num="103">Biologically active ETF may likewise be utilized to treat a variety of other diseases or conditions wherein it is desired to stimulate proliferation of T-lymphocytes; to stimulate the proliferation of B lymphocytes, the secretion of immunoglobulin by B lymphocytes, or the secretion of  GAMMA -Interferon ("IFN") or TNF- ALPHA  by B lymphocytes; to augment anti-infectious disease immunity; to induce CTL, LAK or NK lytic activity; or to augment the destruction of tumor cells or cells infected with virus.</p>
    <p num="104">
      It should be understood that the specific dose level for any particular patient may depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound administered, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease being treated or prevented.
      <br/>
      Preliminary doses can be determined according to animal tests, and the scaling of dosages for human administration can be performed according to art-accepted practices.
      <br/>
      Keeping the above description in mind, typical dosages of ETF may range from about 10 ug per square meter to about 10 mg per square meter.
      <br/>
      A preferred dose range is on the order of about 100 ug per square meter to about 300 ug per square meter.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      The following examples are for purposes of illustration and not by way of limitation.
      <br/>
      Briefly, as shown in the examples below, ETF induces CTLL-2 proliferation, B cell proliferation, CTL, LAK, and NK killing activity and stimulates the secretion of immunoglobulins,  GAMMA -IFN and TNF- ALPHA .
      <br/>
      Accordingly, ETF can be used to augment the destruction of tumor cells or viral-infected cells and to augment anti-infectious disease immunity.
      <br/>
      In addition, ETF stimulates intestinal epithelial cells and protects against radio- and chemotherapy-induced gut toxicity.
      <br/>
      Unlike IL-2, administration of ETF in a mouse model did not cause toxicity related to vascular permeability.

      The ultrafiltration step can be performed using either a YM10 or YM30 spiral cartridge, a hollow fiber cartridge, or a disc membrane in various types of ultrafiltration apparatus.
      <br/>
      An Amicon ultrafiltration system with a YM30spiral cartridge, however, was preferred.

      The ETF activity corresponded to the 15-17 kDa portion of the gel.
      <br/>
      For specific activity determination, purified ETF was resuspened in reducing SDS sample buffer, run on 14% polyacrylamide SDS gel (Novex) and silver stained.
      <br/>
      The purity of the sETF polypeptides corresponding to 15-17 kDa was approximately 222,000 times greater than the sETF polypeptide purity in the CV-1/EBNA conditioned media at the beginnning of the purification scheme (Table 2).
      <br/>
      In addition to purity and protein data, Table 2 shows the activity of the native sETF polypeptide in a CTLL-2 bioassay (described below in Example 2) conducted after each step of the purification process.

      In order to determine whether ETF could protect the gut against radiation induced toxicity, rats were irradiated with 12 Gly to the abdominal cavity on day 0, thereby causing crypt destruction in the intestinal lining.
      <br/>
      The animals were treated with placebo (rat serum) or ETF twice daily on days -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3.
      <br/>
      Rats were sacrificed on day 4 and cross sections of the distal small intestinal were made.
      <br/>
      Crypt microcolonies were counted in the sections along measured distances and data were reported as crypts per mm or crypts per circumference as shown in Table 11.
      <br/>
      A dose response was seen for ETF with the three highest doses showing more crypts than the rat serum control.
      <br/>
      The number of crypts with ETF at 800  MU g/kg/day was significantly different (p&lt;0.01) from rat serum using Student's t-test.
      <br/>
      These data indicate that ETF can protect intestinal epithelium from the effects of radiotherapy.

      In a second model of radiation induced gut toxicity, female C57B1/6 mice were treated with a single dose ip of saline or ETF at 50, 100, or 200  MU g. After 1 hour mice were exposed to 15 Gy of gamma radiation.
      <br/>
      Seventy-two hours later, 1% Evan's blue in saline was given iv. at 10 mL/kg.
      <br/>
      This dye binds to plasma albumin and is confined to the circulation as long as the epithelium is intact.
      <br/>
      Radiation leads to destruction of the intestinal epithelium thus allowing the dye to pass into the lumen of the gut.
      <br/>
      Ninety minutes after the dye was given mice were sacrificed and approximately 8 cm of the small intestine was removed.
      <br/>
      The lumen was lavaged with 1 ml of saline which was collected, sonicated to liberate any dye bound to debris, and clarified by centrifugation.
      <br/>
      The amount of dye was quantitiated by determining the absorbance of the solution at 610 nm, and the data are reported in Table 12.
      <br/>
      A dose response was seen for ETF.
      <br/>
      Using ANOVA and Scheffe individual comparisons, 100 and 200  MU g doses of ETF were significant compared to control.
      <br/>
      ETF thus inhibits the radiation induced breakdown of the intestinal epithelium.
