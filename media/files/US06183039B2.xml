    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to door systems for vehicles and, more particularly, to a pivot and slide door system for an automotive vehicle.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      It is known to provide a door system for a vehicle such as an automotive vehicle to allow an occupant to enter and exit an occupant compartment through a door opening in a vehicle body of the automotive vehicle.
      <br/>
      The door system typically includes a door extending longitudinally to close the door opening.
      <br/>
      The door is pivotally mounted at a front end by a hinge to vehicle structure forming the door opening on the vehicle body.
      <br/>
      The door system also includes a latch at a rear end of the door to latch the door in a close position to a striker connected to the vehicle structure.
      <br/>
      In operation, an operator moves a handle to unlatch the door from the striker and pivot the door via the hinge to open the door opening.
      <br/>
      To close the door, the operator pivots the door via the hinge to close the door opening and engage the latch with the striker.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Although the above door system has worked well, it is desirable to open and close the door opening via the door when the automotive vehicle is parked close to an object.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to improve the ingress/egress through the door opening to the occupant compartment via the door.
      <br/>
      It is further desirable to improve the ease of operation of the door independent of the size of the door.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a need in the art to provide an improved door system for an automotive vehicle.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">It is, therefore, one object of the present invention to provide a pivot and slide door system for an automotive vehicle.</p>
    <p num="7">It is another object of the present invention to provide a pivot and slide door system for a vehicle, which uses the same door opening and seals as current hinge mounted doors.</p>
    <p num="8">
      To achieve the foregoing objects, the present invention is a pivot and slide door system for an automotive vehicle.
      <br/>
      The pivot and slide door system includes a door adapted to be disposed in a door opening of a vehicle body and a pivot assembly attached to the vehicle body and cooperating with the door to pivot the door from a closed position to a pivot position.
      <br/>
      The pivot and slide door system also includes a slide assembly cooperating with the pivot assembly to slide the door from the pivot position to an open position to allow ingress/egress through the door opening.

      One advantage of the present invention is that a pivot and slide door system is provided for an automotive vehicle.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the present invention is that the pivot and slide door system allows door operation in a narrow parking space or when the automotive vehicle is parked closely to an object.
      <br/>
      Yet another advantage of the present invention is that the pivot and slide door system provides improved ingress/egress through the door opening to the occupant compartment of the automotive vehicle.
      <br/>
      Still another advantage of the present invention is that the pivot and slide door system improves ease of operation of the door and is not dependent on door size.
      <br/>
      A further advantage of the present invention is that the pivot and slide door system can have a manual or powered operation.
      <br/>
      Yet a further advantage of the present invention is that the pivot and slide door system can be used with the same door opening and seal as current hinge mounted doors.

      In operation of the pivot and slide door system 20, the door 36 is disposed in the door opening 36 in a closed position as illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      An operator (not shown) manually moves the switch 50 to activate the motor to release the front and rear latches 42 and 44 from the front and rear strikers 46 and 48 and the door 36 is free to swing in an outward direction.
      <br/>
      The operator manually pulls outwardly on the door 36, preferably in the center thereof, to pivot the door 36 outward to a pivot position as illustrated in FIG. 10. The pivot arms 64 and 68 rotate to extend the door 36 laterally a predetermined amount such as sixteen inches such that the door 36 is spaced laterally from the vehicle body 24.
      <br/>
      The projection 118 enters the first recess 116 to rotate the first cam 112 to lock the pivot arms 64 to the support plate 80.

      To close the door 36, the operator manually slides the door 36 forward until the lock pin 128 on the door 36 engages the recess 126 on the second cam 122 and rotates the second cam 122 to release the first cam 112.
      <br/>
      When the operator pivots the door 36, the projection 118 on the rear lower arm 64 rotates to disengage the first recess 116 and the first cam 112 rotates to unlock the rear lower arm 64 of the lower pivot assembly 60.
      <br/>
      The operator manually pushes the door 36 via the arms 64 and 68 to rotate the door 36 inward to the closed position of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that the latches 42 and 44 engage the strikers 46 and 48 to secure the door 36 in the closed position.
      <br/>
      It should also be appreciated that the door 36 could be powered instead of manually moved.
