      A method of cracking a feedstock by contacting the feedstock with a metal-promoted anion-modified metal oxide catalyst in the presence of hydrogen gas.
      <br/>
      The metal oxide of the catalyst is one or more of ZrO2, HfO2, TiO2 and SnO2, and the feedstock is principally chains of at least 20 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The metal-promoted anion-modified metal oxide catalyst contains one or more of Pt, Ni, Pd, Rh, Ir, Ru, (Mn &amp; Fe) or mixtures of them present between about 0.2% to about 15% by weight of the catalyst.
      <br/>
      The metal-promoted anion-modified metal oxide catalyst contains one or more of SO4, WO3, or mixtures of them present between about 0.5% to about 20% by weight of the catalyst.

    <heading>CONTRACTUAL ORIGIN OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. W-31-109-ENG-38 between the U.S. Department of Energy and The University of Chicago representing Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The desire to produce highly isomerized alkanes for high-octane transportation fuels has led to the use of bifunctional catalysts containing dispersed transition metals on acidic supports for alkane hydrocracking, as reported by Sullivan, F. R., Meyer, J. A. ACS Symp. Ser. 1975, No. 20, 28. Bifunctional catalysts consisting of hydrogenation components such as sulfided Ni, Mo, or W promoted on acidic supports such as Al2 O3 or SiO2 --Al2 O3 have been used; they crack n-alkanes to a significant extent but result in little isomerization.
      <br/>
      Noble metals, such as Pt and Pd, are strong hydrogenation catalysts which balance the acidity of supports and were reported to result in high selectivities to isomerized products in alkane hydrocracking, all as reported by W. A. van Hook and P. H. Emmett, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962, 14, 4410 and H. L. Conradt and W. E. Garwood, Ind.
      <br/>
      Eng. Chem. 1960, 52, 113.
      <br/>
      It was previously indicated that the amounts of isomerized and normal alkanes formed in n-alkanes hydrocracking depend on the relative strengths of the metal and acidic functions.
      <br/>
      Over the past two decades, a variety of Pt-promoted zeolites have been used as n-alkanes hydrocracking catalysts and have shown good selectivity to isokanes and increased resistance to heteroatom impurities.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Strong solid acid catalysts have high activity in cracking and skeletal isomerization of n-alkanes, as reported by Y. Nukano et al., J. Catal. 1979, 57, 1, J. C. Yori et al., Catal. Today 1989, 5, 493 and T. Hosoi et al., Am. Chem. Soc. Div. Petr. Chem. 1988, 562, and could serve as effective hydrocracking catalysts, especially when promoted by strong hydrogenation metals such as Pt and Ni.
      <br/>
      The metal-promoted anion-modified zirconium oxides (AZOs) such as Pt/ZrO2 /SO4 and Pt/ZrO2 /WO3, are strong solid acids with an active hydrogenation function; they could potentially replace the conventional bifunctional catalysts.
      <br/>
      There is increased interest in these catalysts because they have high activity at relatively low temperatures(&lt;200 (degree)  C.) favoring isomerization, are environmentally acceptable, are noncorrosive, are easily separated from process streams, and may be regenerated by calcination in air.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      There has been much work reported on the use of these catalysts, especially sulfated zirconium oxide (SZO), for the isomerization of n-butane to isobutane, see T. Hosoi et al.

      <br/>
      Since superacids have been defined as acids stronger than 100% H2 SO4, the AZOs were considered to be solid superacids, but this classification is presently unsettled.
      <br/>
      Whether the activity and nature of acidity of these catalysts are attributable to Lewis or Bronsted acid sites or most likely to both is also under debate.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, there is little doubt that carbocations are involved in most reactions catalyzed by AZOs.
      <br/>
      Pt-promoted SZO is reportedly a more active catalyst for higher alkane cracking and isomerization than most zeolite-based catalysts, see B. H. Davis et al., Catal. Today 1994, 20, 219.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Since there is a move to decrease aromatics and olefins in gasoline, the virtual absence of these compounds in the products may be an advantage of AZOs over zeolites.
      <br/>
      The cracked products obtained using SZOs also have more highly branched isoalkanes than those obtained using zeolites, since lower temperatures favor isomerization. M. Y. Wen et al. Energy &amp; Fuels 1990, 4, 372, showed that Pt/ZrO2 /SO4 and Pt-promoted sulfated mixed oxides of zirconium and hafnium were active for the hydrocracking and hydroisomerization of n-heptane and n-hexadecane at 160 (degree)  C. and 360 psig (cold) H2. The Pt-SZO catalysts were also found to be active for reactions such as hydrocracking of the alkyl chain in long-chain alkylaromatics and for the alkylation of aromatics with alkanes.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      We have found that polymers of widely varying chain lengths, from n-C20 to Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) waxes (C58 -C64), and even long-chain polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, could be hydrocracked in a single step to produce either gasoline-range isoalkanes or a mixture of isobutane and isopentane over AZOs.
      <br/>
      Hydrocracking of long-chain polyolefins to transportation fuels could serve to reduce the large amounts of plastic wastes now consigned to landfills in the United States.
      <br/>
      While metal-promoted AZOs are dual-functional, results indicate that hydrocracking of long-chain n-alkanes (C20 and higher) over these catalysts may not involve the conventional bifunctional mechanism in which the metal plays a dehydrogenation-hydrogenation role resulting in olefinic precursors to carbocations.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The SZOs were prepared by the hydrolysis of zirconium sulfate �H2 ZrO(SO4)2 3H2 O, Pfaltz &amp; Bauer, 99%� with aqueous ammonia (28% NH4 OH, Fisher Scientific) at room temperature followed by filtration.
      <br/>
      The resulting zirconium hydroxide �Zr(OH4)� precipitate obtained was filtered and washed with double-distilled water to remove excess ammonium ions and then dried at 110 (degree)  C. Sulfation of the hydroxide was carried out by adding 1.0 N sulfuric acid (10 mL of acid/g of precipitate) with constant stirring.
      <br/>
      After the sulfated material was dried overnight at 110 (degree)  C., it was ground to smaller than 100 mesh and calculated amounts of Pt or Ni were impregnated using either chloroplatinic acid (H2 PtCl6 6H2 O, Strem Chemical Co., 99.9% or nickel nitrate �Ni(NO3)2 6H2 O), Aldrich Chemical Co., 99.999%).
      <br/>
      They were then calcined at 630 (degree)  C. in air for 3 hours.
      <br/>
      Tungstate-modified zirconia (WZO) was prepared using zirconium nitrate �ZrO(NO3)2 H2 O, Strem� as the starting salt to yield Zr(OH)4. After repeated washing of the precipitate with warm (-50 (degree)  C.) double-distilled water to remove NO3 -ions, calculated amounts of ammonium metatungstate �(NH4)6 W12 O40, Strem, 99.9+%) were used to impregnate the Zr(OH)4 via the incipient wetness technique.
      <br/>
      The molar content of tungsten in Pt/ZrO2 /WO3 was calculated to be the same as that of sulfur on Pt/ZrO2 /SO4.
      <br/>
      The same procedure was used for incorporating MoO3 on ZrO2, using ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6 H2 Mo7 O24 4H2 O, Strem, 99.999%).
      <br/>
      Hydrogenation metals were incorporated using the same procedure as with SZO's and calcinations were carried out at 700 (degree)  C. (for WO3) and 800 (degree)  C. (for MoO3) in air for three hours.

      BET surface areas of catalyst were measured using a Micromeritics ORR surface area and pore volume analyzer and XRD profiles were obtained with a Phillips XPert diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu Ka radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA.

      After cooling to room temperature, the reactants were charged through the 15 cm3 stem attached to the reactor unless otherwise specified.

      The reactor was heated to the desired reaction temperature in a fluidized sand bath while mixing of the reactor contents was provided by horizontal shaking at 200 cpm.

      The physical properties of some of the catalysts that were tested are shown in Table 2.

      Unmodified ZrO2 was calcined at a different temperature than SO4 or WO3 modified catalysts.
      <br/>
      All of the catalysts then had the same tetragonal structure.
      <br/>
      ZrO2 modified by SO4 and WO3 groups had BET surface areas significantly higher than those of unmodified ZrO2 (Table 2).
      <br/>
      Modification of ZrO2 by WO3 resulted in a lower catalyst surface area compared to modification by SO4.
      <br/>
      These observations are consistent with literature results.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Earlier work by Wen et al. and Keogh et al., see R. A. Keogh et al., Energy &amp; Fuels 1994, 8, 755, showed that hydrocracking of n-C16 over a SZPt0.5 catalyst at 160 (degree)  C. and 350 psig (cold) H2 resulted in high conversions and high yields of C4 -C9 alkanes.
      <br/>
      We have found that these catalysts used with n-C32 and F-T waxes (C58 -C64), yield similar conversions and selectivities at 170 (degree)  C. over a SZPt0.5 catalyst (FIGS. 1 and 2).
      <br/>
      Varying feed/catalyst ratios and temperature produces cracked alkanes in the C4 -C9 range, regardless of the chain length of the feed alkane.
      <br/>
      As shown later, by increasing the reaction temperature and reaction time, the products from long-chain alkane hydrocracking consist primarily of gases with high selectivities to isobutane and isopentane.
      <br/>
      It has been reported that the rate of n-butane isomerization over Pt-SZO is enhanced by using a feed containing 33 ppm of butene as an impurity; the reaction order with respect to hydrogen was reported to be negative (-1.1 to -1.3).
      <br/>
      These results are consistent with the conventional bifunctional mechanism of butane isomerization over Pt-SZO.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, our results and those of Keogh et al. show that increasing H2 pressures �from 14.7 to 1600 psig (cold)� increases n-C16 conversion, indicating a positive reaction order relative to H2.
      <br/>
      By adding an olefin of the same carbon number as the alkane feed, we found that the alkane hydrocracking activity of a SZPt0.5 catalyst is severely reduced (Table 3).

      The added olefins were completely hydrogenated.
      <br/>
      This suggests that the olefins selectively adsorb onto acid sites which are then not available for further reaction.
      <br/>
      This inhibiting effect is less for n-C16 than for n-C7 because the difference in cracking activity of an alkane and its corresponding olefin decreases with increase in carbon number.
      <br/>
      Since the added alkenes inhibit the activity of the catalyst, hydrocracking of higher alkanes over Pt-SZO provides further evidence that carbenium ions may not be generated by olefinic precursors.
      <br/>
      Alkanes with carbon numbers exceeding the n-C7 or nC-16 feeds were absent, a result that favors a unimolecular mechanism for hydrocracking of n-C7+ alkanes over Pt-SZO catalysts.
      <br/>
      These observations suggest that the mechanism by which n-butane isomerization and hydrocracking occur differs from the mechanism by which the same reactions take place with higher alkanes.
      <br/>
      Pt-SZO does not seem to act as a conventional bifunctional catalyst for higher (C7+) alkanes.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Although n-C7 and n-C16 alkanes react with certain zeolites to form aromatic or cyclic products, surprisingly no such compounds were found in our reaction products.
      <br/>
      Small amounts (1.4 wt %) of C7, C8 and C9 cycloalkanes only from the reaction of polypropylene over SZPt0.5, were detected.
      <br/>
      These could possibly be formed by twisting of the long polymer chain, allowing interaction with reactive alkyl intermediates during hydrocracking of the polymers.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Increasing the Pt content of sulfated zirconia results in higher conversions and higher yields of C4 -C9, cracked products (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      However, for reaction times of 60 minutes, the effect seems to be small at Pt concentrations exceeding 0.5 wt %, indicating that high hydrogenation activity and elimination of coke precursors are effectively achieved at this concentration and higher.
      <br/>
      The product distribution is shifted toward lower carbon numbers with a higher Pt content on the catalyst (FIG. 4), indicating that cracking activity is increased with increasing Pt content.

      The reaction conditions were adjusted to achieve similar levels of conversion at three different temperatures to compare product selectivities at the same extent of reaction.
      <br/>
      At higher temperatures, the product distribution from hydrocracking of n-C15 over SZPt0.5 shifts towards cracked C4 -C9, alkanes with a corresponding loss in the yield of iso-C16.
      <br/>
      The relative yield of the more desirable isomerized alkanes with respect to normal alkanes for each carbon number of the products is shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The iso/normal alkane ratios of the cracked products obtained at these high temperatures are higher than those predicted by thermodynamic isomerization equilibria.
      <br/>
      This may be due to greater kinetic stability of the branched (tertiary or secondary) carbocations compared to primary cations, resulting in faster desorption of these branched cations by hydride transfer.
      <br/>
      The iso/normal ratio increases significantly as a function of carbon number, indicating that isomerization of higher alkanes precedes cracking.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      By increasing the reaction temperature and reaction time as shown in Table 5 (compare with conditions in FIGS. 2 and 3), the product distribution from long chain alkanes is shifted to C1 -C5. alkanes, of which more than 78 mol % consisted of iso-C4 and iso-C5.
      <br/>
      This is due to the further cracking of the heavier products (C6 + isoalkanes) formed in reactions at mild conditions.
      <br/>
      Small amounts of methane and ethane were formed in these reactions.

      Conversions obtained using nickel as compared to platinum for n-C16 hydrocracking are shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Negligible conversion of n-C16 was observed over SZNi2.0 at 160 (degree)  C. At 300 (degree)  C. and above, however, promotion of 0.5 or 2.0 wt % of Ni on SZO results in an appreciable conversion of n-C16, although lower than that of SZPt0.5. This is explained by the in situ reduction of nickel oxide present on the fresh catalyst (as confirmed by EXAFS and XANES analyses) to the active metallic state at 300+ (degree)  C., which is responsible for providing hydrogenation activity and thus avoiding deactivation by coke formation.

      The results obtained from the hydrocracking of n-C16 over metal-promoted WO3 modified zirconia catalysts (WZOS) for short reaction times are compared with those using metal-promoted SZOs in Table 6.
      <br/>
      The WZOs show a higher conversion toward hydrocracking of n-C16 than do the SZO catalysts.
      <br/>
      This may be due to inherent activity of the tungstated catalysts or due to the loss of sulfur from the SZO catalysts at the severe reducing conditions �300 (degree)  C., 500 psig (cold) H2 � employed.
      <br/>
      The product distribution from the tungstated catalysts also shows a high yield of C4 -C9 alkanes, indicating a substantial degree of cracking.
      <br/>
      A Pt/ZrO2 /MoO3 catalyst gave only a 5 wt % conversion of n-C16 for the same conditions as those in Table 6 perhaps due to the significantly lower acid strength of this catalyst compared to Pt-SZO and Pt-WZO.

      Polyolefins are treated as a separate case as these have long chains of methylene groups and hydrocracking of these to useful products may furnish a way of converting waste polymers to useful transportation fuels.
      <br/>
      In polyolefin hydrocracking, the viscosity of the polymer melt results in mass transfer limitations and poor H2 diffusion; therefore, experiments had to be conducted at higher temperatures than with n-hexadecane.
      <br/>
      As with other alkanes, high conversions and high selectivity to gasoline range (C5 -C12) isoalkanes or to iso-C4 and iso-C5 can be achieved.
      <br/>
      As indicated earlier, one of the most important parameters in hydrocracking of polyolefins over both SO4 --and WO3 --modified catalysts is reaction time.
      <br/>
      Short reaction times (15-25 min) result in a higher yield of C5 -C12 isoalkanes while longer reaction times (60 min.) produce predominantly C1 -C5 light alkanes.
    </p>

      The products obtained from the hydrocracking of HDPE over metal-promoted SZO catalysts are shown in Table 7.
      <br/>
      More than 98 wt % conversion of the polymer was obtained, giving high yields of gasoline-range products with high ratios of iso/normal alkanes for each carbon number (FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      Interestingly, promotion with 2 wt% of Ni instead of 0.5 wt % of Pt resulted in products with a higher ratio of iso/normal alkanes at 375 (degree)  C. As mentioned earlier, the ratio of isomerized to normal alkanes is a function of the balance between the metal promoter and the acid components of AZOs.
      <br/>
      A postulated role of Pt in the catalysts under hydrogen pressures is to dissociate molecular hydrogen into H atoms which then spillover onto acid sites forming protons and hydride ions.
      <br/>
      While protons can replenish Bronsted acid sites, the hydride ions can quench carbocation intermediates.
      <br/>
      The lower hydrogenation activity of nickel compared to platinum (FIG. 6) is responsible for a correspondingly lower concentration of hydride ions on the catalyst surface; the intermediate carbocations could therefore undergo a higher degree of skeletal transformation before desorption from the active sites by hydride transfer.

      The WZPt0.5 catalyst was also active for the hydrocracking and hydroisomerization of HDPE, resulting in high yields of gasoline-range isoalkanes or high selectivities to iso-C4 and iso-C5 (Table 8).

      The iso/normal ratios of alkanes are lower with the tungstated catalyst than with the sulfated catalyst.

      Smaller amounts of C1 -C5 alkanes were produced in the WZPt0.5 catalyzed reaction with a correspondingly larger yield of gasoline-range alkanes.
      <br/>
      This may be due to the lower acid strength of WZPt0.5, reportedly responsible for its lower tendency to cracking compared to SZPt0.5, see E. Iglesia et al.

      The catalysts recovered from some of the hydrocracking reactions at the severe reducing conditions �325-375 (degree)  C., 750-1200 psig (cold) H2 � were analyzed to determine the fate of the anionic groups (Table 14.) The SZPt0.5 catalysts lost a substantial portion of the starting sulfur content, indicating that reduction of the surface sulfate groups to SOx and even to H2 S (odor-apparent) had occurred during reaction.
      <br/>
      Sulfur loss from sulfated zirconia catalysts in n-butane isomerization at 250 (degree)  C. as well as in n-octane hydrocracking reactions at 250 (degree)  C. and above under H2 pressure has recently been reported, see F. T. T. Ng et al., Appl. Catal. A 1995, 123, L197 and R. Mao Le Van et al., Catal. Lett. 1995, 35, 107.
      <br/>
      Sulfur loss is higher in hydrocracking reactions at higher temperatures and is not as severely affected by H2 pressures, indicating that it is more dependent on reaction temperature than on H2 pressure.
      <br/>
      However, the tungsten content of the WO3 -modified catalyst was not appreciably affected by reaction at 375 (degree)  C. under 1200 psig (cold) H2. The loss indicated in Table 14 in tungsten content is largely due to the observed organic content on the recovered catalyst (4.51 wt %) found by recalcining WZPt0.5 at 500 (degree)  C. in air. After the organic content was accounted for, the tungsten loss on the recovered WZPt0.5 was calculated to be 0.05 wt % which is within experimental error.
      <br/>
      Comparison of XRD average particle sizes of the fresh and recovered SZPt0.5 and WZPt0.5 catalysts indicated that, within a  +- 5  Angstrom  error in particle size, there was no agglomeration or sintering of the metal-promoted AZOs during reaction (Table 14).
      <br/>
      The WZPt0.5 catalyst recovered from HDPE hydrocracking was recalcined at 500 (degree)  C. in air for 60 min.
      <br/>
      XANES spectra were obtained for three catalyst samples: fresh, one recovered after HDPE hydrocracking, and that recalcined after recovery from HDPE reaction.
      <br/>
      The Pt L3 edge (11,564 eV) XANES results indicate that Pt is present in the metallic (Pt0) state on these catalysts, consistent with the peak position of standard Pt foil (FIG. 10).
      <br/>
      The same conclusion was reached earlier by others about the state of Pt on Pt promoted SAO, see A. Sayari et al. J. Catal. 1994, 145, 561k.
      <br/>
      The zerovalent state of Pt is maintained, even on fresh (calcined at 700 (degree)  C. in air) as well as with recalcined Pt-WZO catalysts.
      <br/>
      The peak at -18 eV in FIG. 10 corresponds to the W L2 edge at 11 5432 eV.

      Analysis of the WL3 edge (10,207n eV) XANES spectra (FIG. 11) indicates that W is present only in its hexavalent (W6+) state on the catalyst surface, as seen by the fact that it occupies the same position on the catalyst as on the WO3 standard.
      <br/>
      The XANES results, along with XRD profiles of recovered Pt-WZO, indicate that, unlike SO4, WO3 is not reduced to an appreciable extent on the catalyst surface even after reactions at severe reducing conditions.

      Summarizing, metal-impregnated AZOs are environmentally benign, effective catalysts for the hydrocracking and hydroisomerization of a variety of long-chain alkanes to valuable fuels or fuel components in high yields.
      <br/>
      Alkanes from n-C20 to high molecular weight polyolefins (HDPE, PP, or PS) can be used as feedstocks for these reactions.
