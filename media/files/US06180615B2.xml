      Field of Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      This invention includes 2-adenosine propargyl phenyl ether compositions that are useful as A2A receptor agonists.
      <br/>
      The compositions of this invention are vasodialating agents that are useful as heart imaging agents that aid in the identification of mammals, and especially humans who are suffering from disorders such poor coronary perfusion which is indicative of coronary artery disease (CAD).
      <br/>
      The compositions of this invention can also be used as therapeutics for coronary artery disease.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Pharmacological stress is frequently induced with adenosine or dipyridamole in patients with suspected CAD before imaging with T1 scintigraphy or echocardiography.
      <br/>
      Both drugs effect dilation of the coronary resistance vessels by activation of cell surface A2 receptors.
      <br/>
      Although pharmacological stress was originally introduced as a mean of provoking coronary dilation in patients unable to exercise, several studies have shown that the prognostic value of 201 T1 or echocardiographic imaging in patients subjected to pharmacological stress with adenosine of dipyridamole was equivalent to patients subjected to traditional exercise stress tests.
      <br/>
      However, there is a high incidence of drug-related adverse side effects during pharmacological stress imaging with these drugs such as headache and nausea, that could be improved with new therapeutic agents.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Adenosine A2B and A3 receptors are involved in a mast cell degranulation and, therefore, asthmatics are not give the non-specific adenosine agonists to induce a pharmacological stress test.
      <br/>
      Additionally, adenosine stimulation of the A1 receptor in the atrium and A-V mode will diminish the S-H interval which can induce AV block. (N. C. Gupto et al.; J. Am Coll. Cardiol; (1992) 19: 248-257).
      <br/>
      Also, stimulation of the adenosine A1 receptor by adenosine may be responsible for the nausea since the A1 receptor is found in the intestinal tract. (J. Nicholls et al.; Eur. J. Pharm.(1997) 338(2) 143-150).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Animal data suggests that specific adenosine A2A subtype receptors on coronary resistance vessels mediate the coronary dilatory responses to adenosine, whereas subtype A2B receptor stimulation relaxes peripheral vessels (note: the latter lowers systemic blood pressure).
      <br/>
      As a result there is a need for pharmaceutical compositions that are A2A receptor agonists that have no pharmacological effect as a result of stimulating the A1 receptor in vivo.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, there is a need for A2A receptor agonists that have a short half-life, and that are well tolerated by patients undergoing pharmacological coronary stress evaluations.

      Compounds of this invention are useful in conjunction with radioactive imaging agents to image coronary activity.
      <br/>
      The compounds of this invention are A2A agonists that are believed to provide specific activation of adenosine A2A receptors in the coronary vessels as opposed to adenosine A1 receptors in the atrium and AV-node and/or A2B receptors in peripheral vessels, thus avoiding undesirable side-effects.
      <br/>
      Upon administration in a therapeutic amount, the compositions of this invention cause coronary blood vessels to vasodilate to induce coronary steal wherein healthy coronary vessels steal blood from unhealthy vessels resulting in lack of blood flow to heart tissues.
      <br/>
      Coronary imaging then identified coronary regions with healthy and unhealthy blood flow.
      <br/>
      Lower doses of the A2A agonists may provide beneficial coronary vasodilatation (less severe) in the treatment of chronic CAD.

      As A2A agonists, the compositions of this invention are also useful in adjunctive therapy with angioplasty to induce dilation, inhibit platelet aggregation, and as a general anti-inflammatory agent.

      A2A agonists, such as the compositions of this invention, can provide the therapeutic benefits described above by preventing neutrophil activation (Purinergic Approaches in Experimental Therapeutics K. A. Jacobson and M. F. Jarvis 1997 Wiley, New York).
      <br/>
      The compounds of this invention are also effective against a condition called no-reflow in which platelets and neutrophils aggregate and block a vessel.
      <br/>
      As A2A agonists, the compositions of this invention are effective against no-reflow by preventing neutrophil and platelet activation (e.g., they are believed to prevent release of superoxide from neutrophils).
      <br/>
      As A2A agonists, the compositions of this invention are also useful as cardioprotective agents through their anti-inflammatory action on neutrophils.

      Compositions of this invention were assayed to determine their affinity for the A2A receptor in a pig striatum membrane prep. 0.2 mg of pig striatal membranes were treated with adenosine deaminase and 50 mM Tris buffer (pH=7.4) followed by mixing.
      <br/>
      To the pig membranes was added 2  MU L of serially diluted DMSO stock solution of the compounds of this invention at concentrations ranging from 100  MU M to 10 nM or the control received 2  MU L of DMSO alone, then the tritiated antagonist ZM 241385 in Tris buffer (50 mM, pH of 7.4) was added to achieve a final concentration of 2 nM .
      <br/>
      After incubation at 23 (degree)  C. for 2 h, the solutions were filtered using a membrane harvester using multiple washing of the membranes (3 * ).
