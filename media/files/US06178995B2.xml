      A fluid feeding apparatus includes parallel flow passages connected at their downstream side, each parallel passage including a pressure flow controller (C) for regulating the flow of fluid and a fluid changeover valve (D) for opening and closing the passage on the downstream side of the pressure flow controller.
      <br/>
      A fluid feeding control unit (B) controls the pressure flow controllers and changeover valves so that when a changeover valve is closed a control valve (1) upstream of the changeover valve is also closed to prevent a pressure buildup at the changeover valve.
      <br/>
      In addition to the control valve (1), each pressure flow controller includes an orifice (5) downstream from the control valve, a pressure detector (3) for sensing pressure (P1) in the passage at a point between the control valve and the orifice, and a calculation control unit (6) for producing a control signal Qy for controlling the drive (2) for the control valve.
      <br/>
      The calculation control unit first calculates a flow rate signal Qc=KP1, where K is a constant and P1 is the pressure sensed by the pressure detector.
      <br/>
      The calculation control unit then calculates Qy as the difference between a set point or flow rate specifying signal Qs and the calculated value Qc.
      <br/>
      Thus, the flow rate on the downstream side of the orifice is controlled by regulating the pressure P1 on the upstream side of the orifice via the control valve.
      <br/>
      The fluid feeding apparatus avoids transient overshooting at the start of fluid feeding and at fluid changeover time and is suitable for use in semiconductor manufacturing facilities and other gas supply systems where high precision is required.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to an improvement of an apparatus for feeding various kinds of fluids such as gas for use in the manufacture of semiconductors, chemicals, precision machine parts, and the like.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to a fluid feeding apparatus which permits high precision control of the flow rate of fluid at the times of starting to feed a fluid and of switching fluids from one kind to another.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Fluid feeding apparatuses requiring control with high precision of the flow rate are used in semiconductor manufacturing facilities and chemical production plants.
      <br/>
      Most of those apparatuses are equipped with so-called mass flow controllers.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      FIG. 8 shows an apparatus for feeding fluid (gas) for use in a high purity moisture generator in semiconductor manufacturing facilities.
      <br/>
      It is designed so that H2 and O2 are fed to a reactor 51 from a gas feeding apparatus 50 at specific flow rates and are radicalized with a platinum catalyst and allowed to react with each other in a non-combustion state to generate moisture gas (water vapor).
      <br/>
      The moisture gas thus generated in the reactor 51 is then supplied to an oxidizing furnace 52.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In FIG. 8, the reference numeral 54 designates a circuit for measuring moisture generation responsiveness of the reactor 51, and includes a suction rate regulating valve 55, a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Q-mass spectrometer) 56, a turbo molecular pump 57, and a vacuum pump 58.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The Q-mass spectrometer 56 is for measuring ion concentrations of H2 O, H2, O2, and N2.
      <br/>
      A quadrupole mass analyzer MSQ-150A (ULVAC Corporation, Japan) is used for the purpose.
      <br/>
      The aforesaid gas feeding apparatus 50 is formed from three mass flow controllers MFC1, MFC2, and MFC3, changeover valves V1, V2, and V3, gas storage containers (not shown), and pressure regulators (not shown).
      <br/>
      The changeover valves V1, V2, and V3 in this example are of the electric metal diaphragm type.
    </p>
    <p num="8">From the respective gas storage containers (not shown), H2 at a gauge pressure of 2 kgf/cm2, O2 at a gauge pressure of 2 kgf/cm2, and N2 at a gauge pressure of 6 kgf/cm2 are supplied to the primary sides of the three mass flow controllers MFC1, MFC2, and MFC3.</p>
    <p num="9">
      To generate moisture in the reactor 51, in the meantime, the flow rates and other conditions of the three mass flow controllers MFC1, MFC2, and MFC3 in the gas feeding apparatus 50 are set, and then the system is purged with N2, V1 and V2 being closed and V3 being opened.
      <br/>
      Then V3 is closed and V2 , is opened to supply O2, and at the same time that O2 is supplied, or about 3 seconds after the O2 supply, V1 is opened to supply H2.
      <br/>
      Thus, moisture gas (water vapor) starts to be generated in the reactor 51.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Part of the moisture gas or the like from the reactor 51 is sucked into the measurement circuit 54 for a specific time by operating the suction-regulating valve 55, where the concentrations of H2, O2, H2 O, and N2 in the generated moisture are measured by the Q-mass spectrometer 56.</p>
    <p num="11">
      FIGS. 9 to 11 illustrate the concentrations of H2, O2, N2, and H2 O measured by the Q-mass spectrometer 56 in the moistures produced in a moisture-generating testing arrangement.
      <br/>
      The testing arrangement was provided with a gas feeding apparatus 50 equipped with the mass flow controllers as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      And the measurements were taken under the following conditions (1), (2), and (3).
      <br/>
      The gauge pressure of H2, O2, and N2 on the primary sides of the mass flow controllers in the gas feeding apparatus 50 were 2 kgf/cm2, 2 kgf/cm2, and 6 kgf/cm2, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      (1) Pressure on the secondary side of the mass flow controllers: 1 kg/cm2 abs
      <br/>
      H2 : 50 sccm+O2 : 1000 sccm

      H2 starts to be fed 3 seconds after O2 supply.

      <br/>
      H2 : 50 sccm +O2 : 1000 sccm
      <br/>
      N2 : 1000 sccm
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      H2 starts to be fed 3 seconds after O2 supply.
      <br/>
      (3) Pressure on the secondary side of the mass flow controllers: 0.2 kg/cm2 abs
      <br/>
      H2 : 50 sccm+O2 : 1000 sccm

    </p>
    <p num="15">H2 starts to be fed 3 second after O2 supply.</p>
    <p num="16">
      It is to be understood that "sccm" is a unit indicating the flow rate/minute in volume (cm3) of H2, O2, N2, etc. in the standard state.
      <br/>
      As is evident from FIGS. 9 to 11, the concentration of H2 rises and peaks at a peak PH2 at the start of the gas feeding as the pressure decreases on the secondary side of the mass flow controllers MFC's (pressure reduction) in the moisture generation testing arrangement provided with the gas feeding apparatus 50 equipped with mass flow controllers.
      <br/>
      Along with that, there appears a peak PH2 O in the concentration of H2 O.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      H2 and H2 O peak at PH2 and PH2O in the initial stage of the gas feeding.
      <br/>
      That means it is impossible to precisely effect H2 concentration control (flow rate control).
      <br/>
      The mass flow controller cannot meet the demand for high precision control of the flow rate of H2.
    </p>
    <p num="18">It should also be noted that if the peak PH2 of the concentration of H2 rises to several percent, there will arise a possibility of hydrogen exploding in the downstream oxidizing furnace 52, raising a safety problem.</p>
    <p num="19">
      On the other hand, FIGS. 12 to 13 also show the concentrations of H2, O2, N2, and H2 O measured by the Q-mass spectrometer 56 in the moistures produced in a moisture-generating testing arrangement.
      <br/>
      The testing arrangement was provided with a gas feeding apparatus 50 equipped with the mass flow controllers as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      And the measurements were taken under the following conditions (1) and (2).
      <br/>
      The supply pressures (gauge pressures) of H2, O2, and N2 on the primary sides of the mass flow controllers were 2 kgf/cm2, 2 kgf/cm2, and 6 kgf/cm2, respectively.
      <br/>
      (1) Pressure on the secondary side of the mass flow controllers: 0.5 kg/cm2 abs
      <br/>
      H2 : 100 sccm+O2 : 50 sccm (H2 :O2 =2:1)
      <br/>
      N2 : 1000 sccm
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      H2 and O2 started to be fed simultaneously and were cut off at the same time.
      <br/>
      (2) Pressure on the secondary side of the mass flow controllers: 0.5 kg/cm2 abs
      <br/>
      H2 : 100 sccm+O2 : 50 sccm (H2 :O2 =2:1)
      <br/>
      N2 : 1000 sccm
    </p>
    <p num="21">H2 started to be fed 3 seconds after O2 supply and the feeding of H2 was cut off three minutes earlier than O2 cut-off.</p>
    <p num="22">As is clear from FIG. 12, the concentration peak PH2 of H2 in the initial stage of gas feeding rises to some 10 percent if H2 and O2 are fed simultaneously in the gas feeding apparatus 50 equipped with the prior art mass flow controller and there arises a safety question.</p>
    <p num="23">
      Furthermore, the concentration PO2 of O2 suddenly falls in the region where a peak PH2 of H2 is observed because O2 is consumed in its reaction with H2.
      <br/>
      As a result, it will be impossible to generate an intended quantity of moisture.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Also, as is shown in FIG. 13, the concentration peak PH2 of H2 increases to more than some 50 percent at the beginning of gas feeding in the gas feeding apparatus 50 using the prior art mass flow controller, further increasing the danger.</p>
    <p num="25">
      In addition, a large quantity of O2 is consumed at the aforesaid peak PH2 of H2, resulting in a substantial fall in the concentration O2.
      <br/>
      That makes it difficult to produce a required amount of moisture.
    </p>
    <p num="26">As set forth above, the gas feeding apparatus 50 equipped with the prior art mass flow controllers has a problem that the flow rate of H2 and O2 is impossible to control with high precision, because H2 and O2 flow in excessively in what is called an overshooting in the initial stage of the gas feeding or suspension.</p>
    <p num="27">In generating moisture in the gas feeding apparatus 50 with the mass flow controllers, it is natural that the amount of moisture generated deviates greatly from the set level, because of the overshooting of H2 and O2, and it is difficult to control the generation of moisture with high precision.</p>
    <p num="28">
      In the meantime, in the manufacture of semiconductors or the like, it is often necessary to feed many different kinds of gases at specific flow rates to specific places or switch the feeding from one kind to another.
      <br/>
      Also, it is necessary to supply to specific places high purity water produced through a reaction between H2 and O2.
      <br/>
      It is always required that the supply or switchover of gases and H2 O should be effected quickly with high precision.
      <br/>
      That is because high precision control of the flow of gases and moisture is indispensable to improving or securing the production yield as well as the quality of finished products or semiconductors.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="29">
      The present invention is to address the foregoing problems encountered with the apparatus for feeding gases or the like which is equipped with the prior art mass flow controller.
      <br/>
      That is, the prior art fluid feeding apparatus provided with a mass flow controller fails to control the flow of fluid with high precision on account of what is called the overshooting of fluid occurring in the initial stage of the fluid supply.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      It is an object of the present invention, therefore, to provide a fluid feeding apparatus that permits control of the flow rate of gases with very high precision over the whole process, from the start of fluid feeding to its suspension, without causing transient phenomena such as the overshooting of feeding gases.
      <br/>
      The foregoing object is achieved by adopting a pressure flow controller in place of the mass flow controller in the fluid feeding apparatus and also by employing a solenoid-driven high speed actuating type changeover valve as the fluid switchover control valve.
      <br/>
      When used in semiconductor manufacturing facilities, for example, this feeding apparatus makes it possible to realize ideal initial film formation of semiconductors of high integration by controlling the generation of moisture with high precision.
    </p>
    <p num="31">To find the cause of the overshooting phenomenon of fluids just after the start and suspension of supply of fluids, various experiments were carried out using the moisture generation testing arrangement shown in FIG. 8.</p>
    <p num="32">
      As a result, it was discovered that most of the overshooting fluid (gas) in the fluid feeding apparatus 50 with the prior art mass flow controller is the fluid (gas) dwelling in pipe sections L1 to L3 connecting the respective changeover valves V1 to V3 and mass flow controllers MFC1 to MFC3.
      <br/>
      The experiments also indicated that the construction of the mass flow controllers MFC1 to MFC3 was responsible for increasing the dwelling of fluid (gas), that is, the cause of the aforesaid overshooting.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 14 is a block diagram showing the basic configuration of the prior art mass flow controller.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 14, the gas flowing in from the primary side is divided into portions flowing through a laminar flow bypass 59 and a sensor bypass 60.
      <br/>
      In the sensor bypass 60, the mass flow of the fluid is determined by a sensor 61 in the form of temperature change in proportion thereto.
      <br/>
      The determined temperature change is converted into electric signals in a bridge circuit 62 and output through an amplifier circuit 63 and others to a display 64 and also to a comparison control circuit 65 as linear voltage signals.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Meanwhile, the set signals from outside are input from a setter 66 into the comparison control circuit 65, where the difference between the aforesaid detected signals and the set signals is calculated.
      <br/>
      The signal difference is then sent into a valve drive 67, which actuates a flow control valve 68 to bring the signal difference to zero.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Now, if the changeover valve V1 mounted on the secondary side is suddenly closed while the mass flow controller is in operation, the gas flowing through the sensor 61 comes to a standstill.
      <br/>
      Then the control system of the mass flow controller works transiently to increase the flow of gas and the flow control valve 68 is opened.
      <br/>
      As a result, the gas pressure in the secondary side line L1 rises, causing the gas to dwell therein.
      <br/>
      And next time the changeover valve V1 is opened, the dwelling gas rushes into the gas consuming side through the changeover valve V1, causing a gas overshooting phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Finding such structural characteristics in the mass flow controller, the inventors conceived an idea of constructing in the following manner a fluid feeding apparatus free from causing the aforesaid transient phenomena such as the overshooting of fluid.
      <br/>
      That is, this apparatus has adopted a flow rate control mechanism which involves actuating the flow rate control valve by pressure detection signals instead of by mass flow rate detection signals.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The present invention was designed on the basis of the aforesaid idea.
      <br/>
      That is, the present invention provides a fluid feeding apparatus comprising pressure flow controllers to regulate the flow rate of fluid, fluid changeover valves to open and close the fluid passage on the secondary side of the pressure flow controllers, and a fluid feeding control unit to control the operation of the pressure flow controllers and the fluid changeover valves.
      <br/>
      The aforesaid pressure flow controller is formed from an orifice, a control valve provided on the upstream side of the orifice, a pressure detector provided between the control valve and the orifice, and a calculation control unit which outputs a control signal Qy, that is, the difference between a flow rate signal Qc and a flow rate specifying signal Qs, the flow rate signal Qc calculated with the flow rate Qc=KP1 (K=constant) on the basis of a pressure P1 detected by the pressure detector, so as to control the flow rate on the downstream side of the orifice.
    </p>
    <p num="38">The present invention also provides a fluid feeding apparatus which permits the opening and closing of the control valve 1 with the pressure P1 on the upstream side of the aforesaid orifice 5 held some twice or more as high as the pressure P2 on the downstream side.</p>
    <p num="39">
      In one embodiment a plurality of pressure controllers are disposed side by side, the outlets of fluid changeover valves provided on the secondary sides of the respective pressure controllers are communicated with each other and connected to a fluid consumer, and different kinds of fluids are fed to the primary sides of respective pressure controllers.
      <br/>
      The electric high speed actuating type fluid changeover valve maybe a solenoid-driven type high speed actuating fluid changeover valve.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="43">
      Now there will be described an embodiment of a fluid feeding apparatus A according to the present invention, with reference to the drawings.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing the fluid feeding apparatus A according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The fluid feeding apparatus A comprises a fluid feeding control unit B, pressure flow controllers C, and fluid changeover valves D.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The present embodiment comprises three pressure flow controllers C and three fluid changeover valves D so that the supply of gas to the fluid consumer can be freely switched among H2, O2, and N2.
      <br/>
      It goes without saying that the number of pressure flow controllers may be one or four or more.
    </p>
    <p num="45">H2, O2,and N2 are led, at a specific pressure (approximately) from gas storage containers (not shown) through pressure regulators (not shown) to the primary sides of the pressure flow controllers C. To each pressure flow controller C is input each specific flow rate specifying signal Qs from the fluid feeding control unit B. Then the gas from the secondary side of each pressure controller C is controlled by opening the valve D to a specific set flow rate Qs and supplied to the fluid consumer E.</p>
    <p num="46">
      FIG. 2 shows an embodiment of the pressure flow controller C used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The pressure flow controller C includes a control valve 1; a control valve drive 2; a pressure detector 3; a temperature detector 4; an orifice 5; a calculation control unit 6; amplifiers 7a, 7b; A/D converters 8a, 8b; and other features.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The control valve 1 is a so-called direct touch-type metal diaphragm valve, and its drive is a piezoelectric element-type drive.
      <br/>
      The pressure detector 3 is a semiconductor strain type pressure sensor.
      <br/>
      The temperature detector 4 is a thermocouple type temperature sensor.
      <br/>
      Needless to say, the aforesaid drive, pressure sensor, temperature sensor, etc., may be of any type.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The orifice 5 is an orifice made by electric discharge machining a plate-shaped metal gasket.
      <br/>
      Also, an ultra-thin pipe or an orifice formed in a metal film by etching may be used as orifice 5.
      <br/>
      The calculation control unit 6 is formed of what is called the control circuit board, and is equipped with a temperature correction circuit 6a, a flow rate calculation circuit 6b, a comparison circuit 6c, an amplifier circuit 6d, etc.
      <br/>
      It is noted that in case the calculation control unit 6 is used in an atmosphere at a constant temperature as in a clean room, the temperature correction circuit 6a may be omitted without affecting the performance of the calculation control unit 6.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      FIG. 3 is a vertical, sectional view showing a fluid changeover valve D used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The main part of the changeover valve D includes a valve body 10, an electric actuator 11, and a shield case 12.
      <br/>
      In this example, the electric actuator 11 is a solenoid.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The valve block 10 controls the flow of fluid by opening and closing the valve.
      <br/>
      The valve used in this example is of the normally closed type.
      <br/>
      That is, the valve block 10 is formed out of a body 15 provided with a flow channel 13 and a seat 14 therein, a diaphragm 16 made of metal (nickel-based alloy) so provided to be able to sit on the seat 14, a bonnet 17, a bonnet nut 18, a stem 19 extending through the bonnet and movable up and down, a diaphragm presser 20 to press the diaphragm 16, and a spring 21 to always thrust the stem 19 downward (to close the valve).
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The electric actuator 11 is a solenoid.
      <br/>
      The electric actuator 11 comprises a case 23 fastened to the bonnet 17 by a nut 22, a plunger 24 provided in continuity with the stem 19 of the valve block 10, an exciting coil 25 and an iron rod 25a for moving the plunger 24, and a lead 26.
    </p>
    <p num="52">The case 23 is made of aluminum, but may be made of a high magnetic permeability material such as permalloy.</p>
    <p num="53">
      The case 12 is provided outside of the main case 23 with a small space provided therebetween and prevents the leakage of the magnetic field.
      <br/>
      In the present example, the shield case 12, cylindrical and opening at the lower end, comprises a peripheral wall 27 covering the outside of the electric actuator 11, an upper wall 28 covering the upper side of the electric actuator 11, and a through hole 29 with the lead 26 extending therethrough, and is fit over the main case 23.
      <br/>
      The shield case 12 is made of a one-mm-thick sheet of permalloy or malleable iron.
      <br/>
      The shield case 12 to contain the magnetic field has the ferrite bead 30 at a portion where the lead 26 p asses through the upper wall 28.
      <br/>
      The ferrite bead is ring-formed and fitted around the lead 26 inside (under) the upper wall 28 so as to fill up the gap between the lead 26 and the through hole 29.
    </p>
    <p num="54">Next the operation of the fluid feeding apparatus A will be explained.</p>
    <p num="55">
      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the gas pressure P1 on the outlet side of the control valve 1, that is, on the upstream side of the orifice 5, is detected by the pressure detector 3 and sent to the amplifier 7a and the A/D converter 8a to be digitized.
      <br/>
      The signals thus digitized are then input in the flow calculation circuit 6b.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Likewise, the gas temperature T1 on the upstream side of the orifice 5 is detected by the temperature detector 4 and referred to the amplifier 7b and A/D converter 8b to be digitized.
      <br/>
      The digitized signals are then input in the temperature correction circuit 6a.
      <br/>
      In case the temperature correction circuit 6a is omitted, flow rate calculation can be done with analog signals so as to simplify the control circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The calculation control unit 6 calculates the flow rate Q'=KP1 on the basis of the upstream fluid pressure P1 and effects the temperature correction of the flow rate Q' according to correction signals from the temperature correction circuit 6a.
      <br/>
      The calculated flow rate signal Qc is then input in the comparison circuit 6c.
    </p>
    <p num="58">In the meantime, the flow rate specifying signal Qs has been input in the comparison circuit 6c, where the calculated flow rate signal Qc and the flow rate specifying signal Q are compared and the differential signal Qy=Qc-Qs is output as control signal to the drive 2 of the control valve 1.</p>
    <p num="59">
      If the calculated flow rate signal Qc is larger than the flow rate specifying signal Qs, the drive 2 moves to close the control valve 1.
      <br/>
      If the signal Qc is smaller than the signal Qs, the drive 2 moves to open the valve 1.
      <br/>
      That way, the control valve 1 is opened or closed automatically to bring the signal Qc equal to the signal Qs.
    </p>
    <p num="60">Needless to say, it is desirable in the present invention that the ratio of the fluid pressure P2 on the downstream side of the orifice 5 to the upstream fluid pressure P1 on the upstream side, that is, P2 /P1, is always not larger than about 0.5. That means that the fluid pressure P1 on the upstream side of the orifice 5 is about twice or more as high as the fluid pressure P2 on the downstream side.</p>
    <p num="61">In this regard, it may be configured so that the fluid pressure P1 on the upstream side of the orifice 5 and the fluid pressure P2 on the downstream are input in the inversion amplifier 9, as shown by dotted lines in FIG. 2 wherein, if the pressure P1 and the pressure P2 are reversed in amount--a situation in which back flow may arise--or P2 /P1 &gt;0.5 occurs--a situation in which, while there is no back flow, the flow cannot be controlled with high precision--the control valve 1 will automatically shut.</p>
    <p num="62">
      In case the solenoid 11 is not excited, the plunger 24, the stem 19, and the diaphragm presser 20 are brought down by the elastic force of the spring 21 so that the diaphragm 16 is forced to rest on the seat 14 through the diaphragm presser 20, as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      That way, the fluid changeover valve D is closed.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      If the solenoid is energized, then the plunger 24, the stem 19, and the diaphragm presser 20 go up against the elastic force of the spring 21 and the diaphragm 16 will return to its original form by its own elastic force and leave the seal 14.
      <br/>
      As a result, the fluid changeover valve D will open.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The electric high-speed actuating type fluid changeover valve in the present invention will open or close in less than 10 msec as against an average 100 msec for the prior art pneumatic fluid changeover valve.
      <br/>
      That is, the electric high-speed changeover valve works some 10 times as fast.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      It is also noted that when the solenoid 11 is energized (in the initial energizing and holding energizing), the magnetic field leaks out from the exciting coil 25.
      <br/>
      But since the shield case 12 is provided outside of the solenoid 11, the leaked magnetic field is contained and shut off by the shield case 12.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      In the pressure flow controller C according to the present invention, if the fluid changeover valve D is actuated in the direction in which the valve D is closed, the fluid pressure P1 on the primary side of the orifice 5 will rise and the fluid flow rate Q'=KP1 will increase, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Then the difference Qy from the set flow rate Qs (Qs=0) will grow.
      <br/>
      To bring that down, that is, to decrease the fluid pressure P2 on the secondary side, the control valve 1 will be closed.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The actuating mechanism of the pressure flow controller C according to the present invention is summarized in the comparison with that of the prior art, that is, the mass flow controller as in the following table.
      <br/>
      Because of its mechanism, the pressure flow controller C according to the present invention does not allow the fluid to dwell on the secondary side L of the controller C.

    <p num="70">Likewise, FIG. 5 shows changes with time in concentrations of H2, O2, N2, and H2 O measured in the moisture generating tests under the same conditions as in FIG. 10 using the fluid feeding apparatus A of the present invention.</p>

    <p num="73">As comparisons between FIGS. 4 and 9, FIGS. 5 and 10, FIGS. 6 and 11, and FIGS. 7 and 13 indicate, it has been found that even if the set pressure on the secondary side is lowered in the fluid feeding apparatus A of the present invention, peak values of H2 and H2 O will not appear at all.</p>
    <p num="74">
      The fluid feeding apparatus of the present invention shown in FIG. 1 has three units of the pressure flow controller C installed therein.
      <br/>
      It is understood that the number of units is changed depending on the number of kinds of fluids (gases) to be supplied.
    </p>
    <p num="75">It is also noted that in the fluid feeding apparatus of the present invention, a solenoid-driven high-speed actuating valve is used as electric fluid changeover valve D. The type of the fluid changeover valve D is not limited to the solenoid-type high-speed actuating changeover valve but may be of the piezoelectric element drive type such as piezoelectric ceramic.</p>
    <heading>EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="76">
      In the present invention, the flow rate regulator, which is the core of the fluid feeding apparatus, is a pressure flow controller.
      <br/>
      This pressure flow controller is actuated to decrease the pressure on the secondary side when the flow changeover valve is closed.
      <br/>
      Thus the structural characteristics of the pressure flow controller are utilized effectively in this fluid feeding apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      That makes it possible to control the flow of fluid or the moisture generation with high precision without giving rise to transient phenomena such as overshooting of fluid even at the start of fluid feeding or in a transient state such as switchover of feeding fluids.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the fluid changeover valve adopted is a solenoid-driven high-speed actuating valve, which speeds up such operations as changeover from one kind of fluid to another.
      <br/>
      That and no fluid overshooting help to form ideal initial film in the manufacture of semiconductors and contribute greatly to improvement of high-integration semiconductors.
    </p>
    <p num="78">Thus, the present invention would bring about highly practical effects.</p>
