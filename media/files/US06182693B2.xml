    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates generally to fuel tanks for vehicles and, more particularly, to a vapor canister and fuel tank assembly for a vehicle.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      It is known to provide a fuel tank in a vehicle to hold fuel to be used by an engine of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      It is also known to provide a vapor recovery and storage system for the fuel tank of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Typically, the vapor recovery and storage system includes a vapor canister remotely mounted such as in an engine compartment of the vehicle and operatively connected by separate external valves and lines to the fuel tank.
      <br/>
      The vapor recovery and storage system is prone to permeation losses, has limited vapor storage capacity, and limited vapor flow rate acceptance.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Although the above vapor recovery and storage system has worked, it is desirable to integrate the vapor canister into the fuel tank and eliminate separate components outside the fuel tank.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to provide a vapor canister and fuel tank assembly in a vehicle that reduces permeation.
      <br/>
      It is further desirable to provide a vapor canister and fuel tank assembly in a vehicle that lowers cost, lowers evaporative emissions and is easier to package in a vehicle.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">It is, therefore, one object of the present invention to provide a vapor canister and fuel tank assembly for a vehicle.</p>
    <p num="7">It is another object of the present invention to provide a vapor canister and fuel tank assembly for a vehicle that puts the vapor canister, valves, lines, and pressure sensor inside the fuel tank.</p>
    <p num="8">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a vapor canister and fuel tank assembly for a vehicle that reduces evaporative emissions.</p>
    <p num="9">
      To achieve the foregoing objects, the present invention is a vapor canister and fuel tank assembly for a vehicle including a fuel tank having an interior chamber and a tank opening communicating with the interior chamber.
      <br/>
      The vapor canister and fuel tank assembly also includes an insert disposed in the interior chamber and the tank opening and forming a vapor plenum chamber in the tank opening and a canister chamber therein.
      <br/>
      The vapor canister and fuel tank assembly includes a canister bed disposed in the canister chamber to absorb vapor fuel in the vapor plenum chamber.
      <br/>
      The vapor canister and fuel tank assembly further includes a coaxial line having one end for connection to an engine of the vehicle and another end connected to the vapor plenum chamber to allow liquid fuel to communicate with the interior chamber and vapor fuel to communicate with the vapor plenum chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      One advantage of the present invention is that a vapor canister and fuel tank assembly is provided for a vehicle.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the present invention is that the vapor canister and fuel tank assembly reduces evaporative emissions by locating the vapor canister, valves, lines, and pressure sensor inside the fuel tank, thereby combining components and their functions into a tank vapor space.
      <br/>
      Yet another advantage of the present invention is that the vapor canister and fuel tank assembly locates the vapor canister and components inside the fuel tank, which reduces connections, lessens surfaces exposed to permeation, easier to mount and can use less expensive components.
      <br/>
      Still another advantage of the present invention is that the vapor canister and fuel tank assembly provides a vapor canister exposed only to vapor fuel and isolated from liquid fuel, water, salt, dirt, etc., minimizing external connectors and prevents the pressure sensor from being contaminated.
      <br/>
      A further advantage of the present invention is that the vapor canister and fuel tank assembly is easier to package in the vehicle and can be made of steel to eliminate permeation.
      <br/>
      Yet a further advantage of the present invention is that the vapor canister and fuel tank assembly has lower cost due to fewer parts, is easier to mount and can use less expensive materials and components inside the fuel tank.

      <br/>
      The vent valve assembly 96 includes a spring 110 disposed in the valve chamber 101 between the valve 106 and base wall 42 to urge the projection 108 toward the aperture 104 to close the aperture 104.
      <br/>
      The spring 110 is preferably of a coil type.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The vapor canister and fuel assembly 10 includes a liquid trap 112 in the vapor plenum chamber 46 for liquid fuel.
      <br/>
      The liquid trap 112 includes a wall 114 spaced radially from the side wall 34 and extending generally parallel thereto from the base wall 42 of the insert 28.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      The wall 114 is preferably integral, unitary and one-piece with the insert 28.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The vapor canister and fuel tank assembly 10 includes a canister bed 118 disposed in the canister chamber 36.
      <br/>
      The canister bed 118 is generally cylindrical in shape and includes a vapor absorbing material such as activated charchol 120.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that the canister bed 118 is conventional and known in the art.

      The air line 128 has a first portion 32 connected to the pressure sensor 122 and a second portion 134 extending through the canister bed 118 to the bottom of the canister chamber 36.
      <br/>
      The vapor canister and fuel tank assembly 10 further includes a vent solenoid valve 138 fluidly connected to the second portion 134 of the air line 128 and electrically connected to the wires 90.
      <br/>
      The vent solenoid valve 138 is cycled to provide outside filtered air to a bottom of the canister bed 118.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In operation, liquid fuel in the interior chamber 20 of the fuel tank 12 through the pressure fuel line 66, fluid connector 68, conduit 86, fuel connector 84 and fuel line 80 to the engine.
      <br/>
      If there is a liquid fuel leak from the fuel line 80, the liquid fuel would travel through the vapor purge line 78 back to the vapor plenum chamber 46 and become trapped in the liquid trap 112.
      <br/>
      The liquid fuel in the chamber 116 would eventually accumulate to overcome the force of the spring 110 and push the projection 108 from the aperture 108.
      <br/>
      The liquid fuel flows from the chamber 116 through the aperture 104 and into the valve chamber 101.
      <br/>
      When a sufficient amount of liquid fuel accumulates in the valve chamber 101, it flows through the aperture 102 and into the interior chamber 20.
      <br/>
      If any vapor fuel is in the fuel tank 12 or engine is purged to the vapor plenum chamber 46 and is absorbed by the vapor absorbing material 120 in the canister bed 118.
      <br/>
      Filtered air is pumped to the pressure sensor 122 and to the canister bed 118 to flush the canister bed 118.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that the pumping of liquid fuel and purging of vapor fuel is conventional and known in the art.
