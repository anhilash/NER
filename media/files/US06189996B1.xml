    <p num="6">Particular attention recording head has been paid to ink jet system as used in, since this recording system has such advantages that ink is ejected directly to the recording paper, running cost thereof is low and a recording action is quiet.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In recent years, the ink jet recording apparatus, more specifically, the recording head, has been manufactured according to film formation technique or micronization technique in a semiconductor device, and therefore, the production of a more compact and more inexpensive recording head has been realized.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, a replaceable recording head integrated with an ink tank has been proposed and the miniaturized and simple structure of an apparatus itself has been enabled, under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The ink jet recording apparatus having the various advantages as mentioned above has been widely utilized as a recording apparatus for varied devices including an electronic typewriter, a word processor, a facsimile equipment, a copying machine, etc.
      <br/>
      In this case, the ink jet recording apparatus must have a structure which meets functions, and conditions for employment inherent to these devices.
    </p>
    <p num="9">As for the electronic typewriter, the word processor or the like, a compact, light and portable type is liable to be liked, and therefore, the ink jet recording apparatus used for these devices must have been compact and simple in this point.</p>
    <p num="10">
      In the ink jet recording apparatus of such type, a recording operation is performed in such a way that ink is supplied to a recording head, the ink is ejected from an ejection outlet provided on the face of the recording head opposed to a recording medium to form flying ink droplets and the ink droplet is applied to the recording medium.
      <br/>
      In the ink recording apparatus, generally, during the recording operation or when the recording head is not used but is kept standing or the like, ink scum, paper powder or dust may possibly adhere to an ink ejection outlet or air bubbles may enter the interior of the ink ejection outlet, which causes an ink discharge failure.
      <br/>
      These causes of the ink discharge failure have been removed by using recovery methods such as the ink being sucked out of the ink ejection outlet, the ink being discharged from the ejection outlet by pressing an ink supply system, or the ink being removed by performing a prescribed ink discharging operation (called "preliminary discharge" or "idle discharge"), in place of these forced discharging operations, or along with them.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The above described ink jet recording apparatus has operated in response to the automatic operation of the above recover device or a manual operation thereof by an operator when the power of the recording apparatus is turned on, when recording failure is generated during the recording, after a long recording interruption or after a prescribed amount of recording operation.</p>
    <p num="12">
      However, in such an ink jet recording apparatus that the recover device is designed to operate when the power is turned on or during the interruption of the recording operation, irrespective of whether the recording is performed thereafter or not, and therefore, the ink is unavoidably wastefully thrown away according to a discharge stabilizing process (recover process).
      <br/>
      Especially, in recent years, the use of recording heads of a type that the ink is discharged by making use of thermal energy enables the miniaturization of the ink jet recording apparatus to be promoted.
      <br/>
      Some ink jet recording apparatuses, as one example of use, may be integrally built in a word processor, an electronic typewriter and other information processing apparatus.
      <br/>
      In such a recording apparatus, since the power is often turned on for example, only for editing sentences without performing the recording, increase in the amount of ink consumed in the ink jet recording apparatus causes a great problem.
    </p>
    <p num="13">In case where the recover process is performed in response to a manual operation according to the decision of the operator, the recording medium on which the recording failure arises is inevitably wasteful because the recover device operates after the failure in recording is detected.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Further, even if the prescribed number of similar recover operations are automatically carried out when a predetermined stand-by period elapses, the discharge failure including non-discharge may not be completely recovered only depending on the prescribed number of recover operation, in case where, for example, the recording head is left as long as more than one month, because prescribed time and the number of recover operations are constant.
      <br/>
      For instance, in case the recording head has been left as long as 26 hours, the prescribed number of recover operations are conducted, which may, on the contrary, lead to the excessive increase of the recover operations and to the wasteful consumption of the ink due to the suction of ink or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In case the recover operation is conducted when the power is turned on and then, the recording head is left with the power kept turned on without performing the recording operation, there is a possibility that the recovery operation is not carried out during an ordinary recording, resulting in the discharge failure including non-discharge.
      <br/>
      In the control for performing the recover operation every time the power is turned on without taking time from the recovery process of the preceding time into consideration, the recover operation is performed every power on, in case the power is repeatedly turned on and off at intervals of short time, which inconveniently results in an unnecessary recovery operation.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">A primary object of the present invention is to provide an ink jet recording apparatus in which a recording failure can be prevented without consuming ink wastefully.</p>
    <p num="17">Another object of the present invention is to provide an ink jet recording apparatus in which a constantly excellent recording is enabled by making a recovery operation for discharge failure in an adequate manner and at a proper timing.</p>
    <p num="18">A still another object of the present invention is to provide an ink jet recording apparatus in which a recovery operation is started for recovering and preventing the generation of a discharge failure in an ink discharge outlet for discharging ink based on recording data supplied from a main body of an information processing apparatus which is the supply source of the recording data, in response to a command from the main body of the information processing apparatus.</p>
    <p num="19">A further object of the present invention is to provide an information processing apparatus in which recording data and a command starting a recovery operation for recovering a discharge failure in an ink discharge outlet and preventing the generation of the discharge failure are supplied to an ink jet recording apparatus having the ink discharge outlet for discharging ink based on the recording data.</p>
    <p num="20">
      According to the present invention, the recover process of the ink jet recording apparatus is controlled by the main body side of an information processing apparatus and during the recording operation by using the ink jet recording apparatus, the recover operation is performed only when it is required, and therefore, the useless consumption of ink can be avoided.
      <br/>
      The employment of a timer function which is usually provided in the information processing apparatus in order to control the start timing of the recover process makes it unnecessary to provide a timer or a back-up power source in the ink jet recording apparatus side, so that the increase of cost for constructing or maintaining the ink jet apparatus can be suppressed.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Since the form or the number of a series of recover operations such as the suction of ink, preliminary discharge which are carried out upon turning a power on or starting recording is variable in accordance with, for example, time elapsing from the recover operation of the last time, an essential recover operation can be performed more accurately and adequately.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="23">One embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanied drawings.</p>
    <p num="24">FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B are perspective views showing the appearance of a sentence processing apparatus such as a word processor, an electronic typewriter, etc., to which the present invention is applied.</p>
    <p num="25">
      On a keyboard 1, key groups 2 such as keys, control keys for inputting characters, numeric characters or the like are arranged.
      <br/>
      The keyboard is collapsible around a hinge 3 as shown in FIG. 1B when it is not used.
      <br/>
      A paper feed tray 4 serves to feed a sheet like recording medium to a printer part in the apparatus.
      <br/>
      The paper feed tray 4 is also housed in the apparatus when it is not used by covering the printer part as shown in FIG. 1B. A feed knob 5 serves to manually set or eject the recording medium.
      <br/>
      A display device 6 displays an inputted sentence or the like.
      <br/>
      A handle 7 is used for carrying the apparatus according to the present embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      A cover 8 of the sentence processing apparatus serves as a window provided on the upper part of the apparatus which is adjacent to the display device 6.
      <br/>
      A housed ink jet printer or recording medium can be seen through it, as described later.
    </p>
    <p num="27">FIG. 2 is a typical perspective view showing the main parts of a printer part according to the present embodiment.</p>
    <p num="28">
      In FIG. 2, a recording medium 11 is supported by conveying rollers 12, 13 disposed above and below a recording region and conveyed toward the direction shown by an arrow A by the conveying roller 12 driven by a sheet feed motor 14.
      <br/>
      At the front side of the conveying rollers 12, 13 are disposed guide shafts 15 on which a carriage 16 is driven in reciprocating motion through a wire 18 by the output of a carriage motor 17.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      On the carriage 16 is mounted a recording head 19 for ejecting ink by making use of thermal energy.
      <br/>
      The recording head 19 has a recording part provided on the front face thereof, which is opposite and spaced apart from the recording medium 11 and on which face a plurality of ink ejection outlets are arranged to form a longitudinal line.
      <br/>
      At the end of the guide shafts, a recover mechanism 20 is provided at a position opposite to the front face of the recording head 19 mounted on the carriage 16.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      FIG. 13 is a typical view showing a suction recover device as an example of the recover mechanism 20.
      <br/>
      A pump 22 driven by a pump driving motor 21 communicates with a cap 23 which is opposed to the front face of the recording head 19, for example, at a home position of the recording head 19 and disposed so as to be attachable thereto or detachable therefrom.
      <br/>
      The pump 22 performs an operation for sucking a prescribed amount of ink from the ink ejection outlets in response to a signal sent from a printer control portion 24' through a recover mechanism control circuit 36.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Returning to FIG. 2, the printer control portion 24' including the control circuit (CPU) of the recording apparatus and a ROM for storing program or other fixed data or a RAM for operation them which are provided along with the CPU is formed on a control substrate 24.
      <br/>
      The printer control portion 24' receives a signal from the main body of the sentence processing apparatus 25 and controls the driving of various motors and the recording head based thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="32">FIG. 4 is a block diagram showing a structural example of a control system of the sentence processing apparatus of this embodiment.</p>
    <p num="33">
      A central processing unit (CPU) 51 processes characters or the like input from the keyboard part 1, displays them on the display device 6 or stores them in a read/write memory device (RAM) 55. A read only memory device (ROM) 54 stores program or fixed data or the like corresponding to the processing procedure executed by the CPU 51.
      <br/>
      A timer 57 serves to control time.
      <br/>
      A battery 56 for back-up continues to operate the timer 57 and the RAM 55 even when a power source 58 of the sentence processing apparatus is disconnected.
      <br/>
      An ink jet recording apparatus 59 is described with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      The CPU 51 in the main body of the sentence processing apparatus 25 outputs a recording command signal, recording information or other control signals to control a recording operation or a recover process by the printer control portion mounted on the control substrate 24.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing one example of a control procedure of the present embodiment.
      <br/>
      This control procedure is designed so that in case a printing (recording) is to be done by the ink jet recording apparatus, when the present time for printing passes more than one week from the last time when a command for recover operation is outputted, a command for recover operation is outputted before the output of a command for printing.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      First, in a step S1, whether an operator who intends to start recording by the ink jet recording apparatus pushes a print command key or not is judged.
      <br/>
      If the does not push the key, this procedure is finished, and then it proceeds to other process, for example, a sentence edition or the like.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the operation of the print command key is detected, the present time is read by the use of the timer 57 (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Then, the time when the command for recover operation was last output is read from the RAM 55 in a step S3.
      <br/>
      Next, in a step S4, the time read in the step S2 is compared with the time read in the step S3.
      <br/>
      If more than one week passes from the time read in the step S3 to the time read in the step S2, the procedure proceeds to a step S5 and a command for recover operation is output to the ink jet recording apparatus.
      <br/>
      Then, the printer control portion 24' starts the above described recover operation in response thereto.
      <br/>
      In a step S6, a time storage region in the RAM 55 is rewritten by regarding the present time as the time when the command for recover operation is outputted.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the procedure proceeds to a step S7, and printing information designated by the operator is transferred to the ink jet recording apparatus to be printed.
      <br/>
      In case it is judged that more than one week does not elapse from the last time of command for recovery operation, the procedure immediately proceeds to the step S7.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The recover process is not limited to the forced ejection or discharge of ink by sucking out the ink but also may be applicable to such a forced ejection of ink that an ink supply system leading to the recording head 19 is pressed to forcedly eject the ink.
      <br/>
      Further, the recover process may be performed, through, in place of these forced ejections of ink, preliminary ejection of ink or along with them.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Although in the present embodiment, in case the recover operation has not been performed for more than one week, on starting a printing process, the above recover process is conducted, it will be noted that such a period may be suitably determined depending on the performance of the recording head.
      <br/>
      Such a period may be variable depending on environmental conditions such as ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      In addition, in case a plurality of types of recover processes are combined and used, the period may be varied in accordance with the types thereof and the combination of the recover processes may be changed.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Further, although, in the above embodiment, the ink jet recording apparatus is integrally built in the information processing apparatus in the form of a sentence processing apparatus, a computer, facsimile equipment or the like may be applicable as examples of the information processing apparatus and the ink jet recording apparatus may be formed separately from the main body of the information processing apparatus.</p>
    <p num="39">Still further, the ink ejection recover processes are not wholly controlled by the main body side of the information processing apparatus, but may be independently performed by the ink jet recording apparatus side through an automatic or manual operation if required during a recording operation.</p>
    <p num="40">
      As explained in the foregoing pages, since the recover process of the ink jet recording apparatus is controlled by the main body side of the information processing apparatus and the recover process is conducted only when it is required upon a recording operation using the ink jet recording apparatus, the wasteful use of the ink can be avoided.
      <br/>
      Also, since the timer function which is usually provided in the information processing apparatus in order to control the starting timing of the recover process is utilized, the provision of a timer or a power source for back-up is not necessary at the ink jet recording apparatus side, and therefore, cost for constructing or maintaining the ink jet recording apparatus can be suppressed.
    </p>
    <p num="41">Another embodiment of the present invention will be described in the following by referring to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="42">FIG. 6 is a perspective view showing another embodiment of a document processing apparatus provided with the ink jet recording apparatus according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="43">
      This document processing apparatus is provided with a main body 66 comprising a keyboard 61 which is an input part for data such as document information and control command, a display part 62 on which the document information is displayed and a drive unit 63 for driving a floppy disk.
      <br/>
      This main body 66 is connected to an ink jet recording apparatus 68 through an interface cable 67.
      <br/>
      The main body 66 is connected to a power source (not shown) by a power plug 65 and started by turning the power switch 64 of the main body 66.
    </p>
    <p num="44">The ink jet recording apparatus 68 will be explained in more detail with reference to a perspective view of main parts shown in FIG. 7.</p>
    <p num="45">
      In the ink jet recording apparatus 68, an ink jet recording head 70 and an ink jet head cartridge 69 integrated with an ink tank (not shown) are mounted on a carriage 71.
      <br/>
      The carriage 71 is connected to one part of a driving belt 72 for transmitting the driving force of a driving motor 73 and slidingly attached to two guide shafts 74A, 74B which are disposed in parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      The ink jet recording head 70 moves in a reciprocating motion by the driving force of the driving motor 73 along the entire width of recording paper (recording medium) fed on a platen 75 from a recording medium feeder (not shown) so as to face the surface having ink ejection outlets of the ink recording head 70 and conducts a recording on the recording paper.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The above-mentioned ink jet recording head 70 has ink ejection outlets facing the recording surface of the recording paper and electrothermal transducers employed for ejecting ink from the ejection outlets.
      <br/>
      To the ink ejection outlets is supplied ink from an ink tank integrated in the ink jet head cartridge 69.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The ink jet recording apparatus 68 is provided with a head recover device 76 having a cap part 76A for capping the surface having the ink ejection outlets of the head.
      <br/>
      This recover device 76 is driven by the driving force of a motor 78 through a transmission mechanism 79 facing the surface having the ink ejection outlets of the jet recording head 70 at a position (left end of a guide shaft 74A in FIG. 7, called "recover position", hereinafter) where the ink jet recording head 70 is moved during the head recover operation, outside the range of the reciprocating motion of the ink jet recording head 70 during the recording operation.
      <br/>
      This head recover device 76 achieves the suction of ink by means of a proper sucking means or the forced feed of ink by means of a proper pressing means disposed in an ink supply path leading to the ink jet recording head 70, in connection with capping of the surface having the ejection outlets of the ink jet recording head 70 by the cap part 76A, during the head recover operation, to forcedly eject the ink from the ink ejection outlets, whereby the ejection and recover operation such as thicker ink in an ink passage communicating with the ejection outlets being removed is performed.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      On the side face of the head recover device 76, a blade 77 formed of silicone rubber as a wiping member is held in the form of a cantilever by a blade holding member 77A.
      <br/>
      The blade 77 is operated by the motor 78 and the transmission mechanism 79, like the head recover device 76, and can slidingly and frictionally engage with the surface for the ejection outlets of the ink jet recording head 70.
      <br/>
      Thus, after the recover operation for ejection failure by using the head recover device 76, the blade 77 is caused to protrude in the moving path of the ink jet recording head 70 and dew drops, wetting or dusts, etc., sticking to the surface for the ejection outlets of the ink jet recording head 70 are wiped out, along with the movement of the ink jet recording head 70.
    </p>
    <p num="49">The above-described ink jet recording apparatus 68 receives data such as document information, control command, etc., inputted from the keyboard 61 through the main body 66 and the interface cable 67 and performs a series of recording operations of the document information and the above head recover operation, based on the received data.</p>
    <p num="50">
      A printing control system of the ink jet recording apparatus 68 will be explained below by referring to a block diagram in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      A CPU 81 comprises a one-chip element consisting of a RAM81 used as a buffer memory or a below mentioned power-on flag and a ROM81 storing a program for executing a below mentioned operation or the like.
      <br/>
      The CPU 81 transfers various kinds of commands sent from the main body 66 to a driving portion 82 for a recover device or a driving portion 84 for a recording part and operates as a recover control means.
      <br/>
      The driving portion 82 for the recover device supplies electric power from a power source part 87 to the head recover device 76 in response to a command from the main body 66 which is transferred by the CPU 81 to drive the head recover device 76.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      A recording part 85 comprises the ink jet recording head 70, the carriage 71, the driving belt 72, the driving motor 73, the guide shafts 74A, 74B, the platen 75, the motor 78, and the transmission mechanism 79 shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      The electric power from the power source part 87 is supplied to the recording part by the driving portion 84 for the recording part to drive the recording part in accordance with an instruction of the main body 66 which is transferred from the CPU 81.
      <br/>
      The main (host) body 66 is a device for transmitting instruction such as recording command or recording information to the CPU 81 and its power source is independent.
      <br/>
      The main body may be constructed in a personal computer or the like as well as in the document processing apparatus (word processor) as illustrated in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The power source part 87 supplies the electric power to the driving portion 82 for the recover device and the driving portion 84 for the recording part.
    </p>
    <p num="52">Referring to a flow chart shown in FIG. 9, the operation of the embodiment shown in FIGS. 6 to 8 will be explained in the following.</p>
    <p num="53">
      In a step S11, a power is turned on.
      <br/>
      When the electric power is supplied from the power source part 87 to the CPU 81, the driving portion 82 for the recover device and the driving portion 84 for the recording part, the CPU 81 begins to perform the program stored in the ROM 812.
      <br/>
      In a step S12, the CPU 81 sets a power-on flag to which a prescribed address in the RAM 811 is assigned to "1".
      <br/>
      In a step S13, it waits for a recording command from the main body 66.
      <br/>
      In the step S13, if there is a recording command, that is, the recording command is sent from the main body 66, whether said power-on flag is set at "1" or not is checked in a step S14.
      <br/>
      If the power-on flag is set at "1" in the step S14, the head recover device 76 is operated by the driving portion 82 for the recover device to keep the ejection outlets (not shown) of the recording head 70 in a normal state in a step S15.
      <br/>
      After the power on flag is set to "0" in a step S16, a recording is effected in a step S17 as instructed from the host device 66.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, if the power-on flag is not set at "1" in the step S14 (if it is set at "0"), the recording is effected in the step S17 without operating the head recover device 76.
      <br/>
      After the step S17 is performed, the procedure returns to the step S13 to wait for a recording command from the main body 66.
      <br/>
      The operations mentioned above are repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="54">The power source part 87 may be applicable to either side of the ink jet recording apparatus and the main body 66, because the recover operation can be enabled by turning the power source on.</p>
    <p num="55">As understood from the foregoing explanation, since a recover means is operated when a first recording command is sent from the host device after the power is turned on, according to the present invention, the useless consumption of ink, when turning the power on for the purpose other than recording, can be eliminated and the generation of recording failure during recording can be prevented.</p>
    <p num="56">The present invention is particularly usable for such type of recording head as having thermal energy generating means which generate thermal energy utilized for ejecting or discharging ink, since ink scum easily adheres to the periphery of an ink ejection outlet or air stays in the interior of the ink ejection outlet because of the thermal energy, as a result, the ink ejection outlet is readily clogged.</p>
    <p num="57">A still another embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail by referring to the accompanied drawings.</p>
    <p num="58">FIG. 10 is a typical perspective view showing main parts of a printer part according to the present embodiment.</p>
    <p num="59">
      In FIG. 10, a head cartridge 109 has an ink jet recording head.
      <br/>
      The head cartridge 109 is mounted on a carriage 111 for scanning in the direction S in FIG. 10. A hook 113 serves to attach the head cartridge to the carriage 111.
      <br/>

      When this procedure starts, whether there is such an abnormality that the battery for backing up the timer 1003 is run out or not is first checked when the power is turned off, in a step S51.
      <br/>
      This battery check can be made according to a well known method.
      <br/>
      If the battery is in a normal state, the procedure proceeds to a step S52 to know the time passing from the ejection and recover operation. at the last time based on the time counted by the timer 1003 and judge whether this time is a prescribed time T2 (one month in this embodiment) or more or not.
      <br/>
      According to this judgement, when it is judged that the elapsing time is less than one month, the procedure proceeds to a step S53 to judge whether this time is not less than a second prescribed time T1 (26 hours in this embodiment) or not.
      <br/>
      If the elapsing time is less than 26 hours, the ejection or discharge recover operation is not performed to finish the procedure.

      Then, in a step S59, a timer for the elapsing time is reset to finish the present procedure.
      <br/>
      In the step S52, when it is judged that the elapsing time is one month or more, the ejection or discharge recover operation is performed three times in a step S56.
      <br/>
      After that, in a step S57, the timer is reset.
      <br/>
      Further, in the step S51, if it is judged that abnormal state such as a battery being run out, arises, the ejection or discharge recover operation is done once to make sure of safety in a step S54, because elapsing time from the turning off of power is uncertain.

      When a recording instruction is outputted with the cap closed, the above ejection recover operation is started.

      In a step S61, the abnormality of the battery is checked.

      When the battery for backing up the timer is in a normal state, whether elapsing time from the recover operation of the last time is a prescribed time T4 (one month in the present embodiment) or more or not is judged.
      <br/>
      When it is judged that the elapsing time is less than one month, whether the elapsing time is a prescribed time T3 (34 hours in this embodiment) or more or not is judged in a step S63.

      Then, in a step 67, the timer is reset to finish the procedure.
      <br/>
      In the step S61, when it is judged that the battery is in an abnormal state, the ejection recover operation is not conducted to finish the procedure.
      <br/>
      In the present procedure, in case the ejection or discharge recover operation is to be executed, the procedure immediately shifts to a train of ejection recover operations after thne sucking operation with the cap closed.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      Although the number of the recover operations is varied according to the elapsing time in the above embodiment, the contents thereof may changed.
      <br/>
      For example, when the elapsing time is short, the sucking operation is not done but only the preliminary ejection or preliminary discharge may be conducted.
      <br/>
      This may be suitably determined in accordance with the specification of the recording head and circumstnaces where the recording head is employed.

    <p num="78">It will be noted that the setting time or the number of times of the ejection or discharge recover operations which are references for the judgement of the elapsing time in the above embodiment are not limited to those values.</p>
    <p num="79">As for a starting point for counting the elapsing time, it may mot be limited to the time when the recover operation of the preceding time is done but may be, for example, the time when the recording operation of the last time is finished or the time when the power is turned off.</p>
    <p num="80">As can be seen from the foregoing description, since the contents or the number of times of a train of ejection or discharge recover operations such as the suction of ink, the preliminary ejection, etc, which are performed upon turning power on or starting a recording may be variable in accordance with, for example, the elapsing time from the recover operation of the preceding time, an essentially required ejection recover operation can be performed accurately and properly.</p>
    <p num="81">As a result, the consumption of the ink necessary for the ejection recover operation, time taken for the recover operation, capacity of the waste tank, etc,. can be minimized.</p>
    <p num="82">
      In case the ejection recover operation is not performed when the power is turned off because of, for instance, the elapsing time, the ejection recover operation may be conducted as soon as the recording is started.

    <p num="83">
      The present invention is particularly suitably usable in an ink jet recording head and recording apparatus which discharges the ink by usage of thermal energy.

    <p num="84">
      The typical structure and the operational principle of preferably the one disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,723,129 and 4,740,796.
      <br/>
      The principle is applicable to a so-called on-demand type recording system and a continuous type recording system particularly however, it is suitable for the on-demand type because the principle is such that at least one driving signal is applied to an electrothermal transducer disposed on a liquid (ink) retaining sheet or liquid passage, the driving signal being enough to provide such a quick temperature rise beyond a departure from nucleation boiling point, by which the thermal energy is provide by the electrothermal transducer to produce film boiling on the heating portion of the recording head, whereby a bubble can be formed in the liquid (ink) corresponding to each of the driving signals.
      <br/>
      By the development and collapse of the bubble, the liquid (ink) is ejected through an ejection outlet to produce at least one droplet.
      <br/>
      The driving signal is preferably in the form of a pulse, because the development and collapse of the bubble can be effected instantaneously, and therefore, the liquid (ink) is ejected with quick response.
      <br/>
      The driving signal in the form of the pulse is preferably such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,463,359 and 4,345,262.
      <br/>
      In addition, the temperature increasing rate of the heating surface is preferably such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,313,124.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The structure of the recording head may be as shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,558,333 and 4,459,600 wherein the heating portion is disposed at a bent portion in addition to the structure of the combination of the ejection outlet, liquid passage and the electrothermal transducer as disclosed in the above-mentioned patents.
      <br/>
      In addition, the present invention is applicable to the structure disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Publication No. 123670/1984 wherein a common slit is used as the ejection outlet for plural electrothermal transducers, and to the structure disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 138461/1984 wherein an opening for absorbing pressure wave of the thermal energy is formed corresponding to the ejecting portion.
      <br/>
      This is because, the present invention is effective to perform the recording operation with certainty and at high efficiency irrespective of the type of the recording head.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      The present invention is effectively applicable to a so-called full-line type recording head having a length corresponding to the maximum recording width.
      <br/>
      Such a recording head may comprise a single recording head and a plural recording head combined to cover the entire width.
    </p>
    <p num="87">In addition, the present invention is applicable to a serial type recording head wherein the recording head is fixed on the main assembly, to a replaceable chip type recording head which is connected electrically with the main apparatus and can be supplied with the ink by being mounted in the main assembly, or to a cartridge type recording head having an integral ink container.</p>
    <p num="88">
      The provision of the recovery means and the auxiliary means for the preliminary operation are preferable, because they can further stabilize the effect of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As for such means, there are capping means for the recording head, cleaning means therefor, pressing or sucking means, preliminary heating means by the ejection electrothermal transducer or by a combination of the ejection electrothermal transducer and additional heating element and means for preliminary ejection not for the recording operation, which can stabilize the recording operation.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      As regards the kinds of the recording head mountable, it may be a single corresponding to a single color ink, or may be plural corresponding to the plurality of ink materials having different recording color or density.
      <br/>
      The present invention is effectively applicable to an apparatus having at least one of a monochromatic mode mainly with black and a multi-color with different color ink materials and a full-color mode by the mixture of the colors which may be an integrally formed recording unit or a combination of plural recording heads.

      Furthermore, in the foregoing embodiment, the ink has been liquid.
      <br/>
      It may be, however, an ink material solidified at the room temperature or below and liquefied at the room temperature.
      <br/>
      Since in the ink jet recording system, the ink is controlled within the temperature not less than 30 (degree)  C. and not more than 70 (degree)  C. to stabilize the viscosity of the ink to provide the stabilized ejection, in usual recording apparatus of this type, the ink is such that it is liquid within the temperature range when the recording signal is applied.
      <br/>
      In addition, the temperature rise due to the thermal energy is positively prevented by consuming it for the state change of the ink from the solid state to the liquid state, or the ink material is solidified when it is left is used to prevent the evaporation of the ink.
      <br/>
      In either of the cases, the application of the recording signal producing thermal energy, the ink may be liquefied, and the liquefied ink may be ejected.
      <br/>
      The ink may start to be solidified at the time when it reaches the recording material.
      <br/>
      The present invention is applicable to such an ink material as is liquefied by the application of the thermal energy.
      <br/>
      Such an ink material may be retained as a liquid or solid material on through holes or recesses formed in a porous sheet as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 56847/1979 and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 71260/1985.
      <br/>
      The sheet is faced to the electrothermal transducers.

    <p num="91">The ink jet recording apparatus may be used as an output terminal of an information processing apparatus such as computer or the like, a copying apparatus combined with an image reader or the like, or a facsimile machine having information sending and receiving functions.</p>
    <p num="92">According to the present invention, at least one side of the four sides of the orifice plates are not bonded with the front seal plate, and therefore, even if the front seal is influenced by the difference in the thermal expansions of various elements, the force applied to the orifice plate can be significantly reduced, and the deformation or the crack production of the orifice plate of the top plate can be prevented.</p>
