      <br/>
      An automated conveyor sortation and item discharge system for sorting items of various sizes and weights to designated output destinations along a conveyor is provided.
      <br/>
      The system utilizes a discharge drum ejection mechanism mounted medially between a pair of parallel cog belt conveyors for ejecting an item such as a parcel laterally from the surface of the cog belt conveyors to an adjacent chute or slide.
      <br/>
      The discharge drum of the ejection mechanism is generally rectangular and defines convex opposing sides separated by the longer diameter of the drum.
      <br/>
      The convex sides of the discharge drum define flexible ridges for contacting an overlying parcel to be discharged from the surfaces of the cog belt conveyors.
      <br/>
      The flexible ridges enhance translation of the item or parcel by the discharge drum and serve to reduce noise caused by the impact of the discharge drum with the overlying parcel.
      <br/>
      A tapered discharge drum may be used to counteract rotation of the parcel during discharge.
      <br/>
      A programmable controller may be provided to control the conveyor system and the discharge of items from the conveyor by the ejection mechanisms.
      <br/>
      The system is easy to repair and operates at high speeds at reduced noise levels.
      <br/>
      Also provided is a relatively flat disc intermediate a conveyor gap, which may be disassembled without disturbing the shaft to which the disc is mounted.

      No. 08/841,201, filed Apr. 29, 1997, entitled "High Speed Drum Sorting Conveyor Systems".

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to automated sorting of items such as parcels to a variety of output destinations, and more particularly relates to conveyor systems which have the capability to rapidly and reliably discharge parcels (which can also be referenced as packages) or other items thereon to either side of a conveying path, such that the packages or other items may be transported elsewhere.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      In modern high volume package delivery systems, package delivery services utilize a variety of material handling systems.
      <br/>
      Such material handling systems often include package conveying systems that divert packages to a variety of output destinations such as chutes, bins, and conveyor systems.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      One of the most conventional types of conveyors is a belt conveyor, which includes the use of an endless flexible belt which passes over at least two cylindrical rollers, one of which is a drive roller.
      <br/>
      Packages are placed atop the upwardly-directed "working" surface of the belt conveyor, and are transported in a generally straight direction from end of the conveyor to the other.
      <br/>
      Another type of conveyor is a "roller" conveyor which con include powered or idling rollers which contact, support, and in certain instances propel the bottom of the package along its path.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Systems for diverting objects from a moving conveyor have been available for many years.
      <br/>
      Such systems are useful in discharging objects from a conveying surface at selected stations located along the path of the conveying surface.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Some package diverting systems utilize a pusher element or member mounted on or beneath a conveying surface which when actuated ejects a package laterally across the conveying surface to a desired discharge station.
      <br/>
      Many such systems guide a pusher element laterally across the conveying surface using a complex series of guide tracks, or elements mounted beneath the conveying surface.
      <br/>
      Other systems utilize a means for elevating and tilting a package above and away from the upper surface of a conveying surface so that the package may be withdrawn to an awaiting chute or discharge station.
      <br/>
      Still other systems have been known to collapse the conveying surface such that the package falls to a subjacent conveying surface on which the package is translated to a desired discharge location.
    </p>

      U.S. Pat. No. 1,462,511 discloses another conveyor diverter.
      <br/>
      A side conveyor extends perpendicular from a main conveyor.
      <br/>
      A set of diverting rollers are configured perpendicular to the main conveyor and are raised above the upper surface of the main conveyor to cause an object to be diverted from the surface of the main conveyor under force of gravity across the set of diverting rollers.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      U.S. Pat. No. 1,549,499 discloses an elevating means for use in connection with roller bed sorting tables for raising a box or parcel a slight distance above the plane of the roller bed to allow the box or parcel to be withdrawn to an awaiting chute or discharge station.
      <br/>
      A box or parcel to be discharged is brought to a state of rest at a sorting station immediately above an elevating roller.
      <br/>
      The elevating roller is raised by depressing a foot lever.
      <br/>
      The box or parcel positioned over the elevating roller is raised off the roller bed which allows an operator to pull the box or parcel off the roller bed on to an adjacent chute or discharge station.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A box or parcel switching unit for discharging a box sideways on to an adjacent storage conveyor or chute is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,062,604. A box or parcel is brought to a stopped position on a receiving conveyor and overlying a discharge conveyor.
      <br/>
      The receiving conveyor is dropped from beneath the box or parcel allowing it to come to rest on the discharge conveyor.
      <br/>
      The box or parcel is then translated off the surface of the discharge conveyor to an awaiting adjacent conveyor or chute.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,138,238 discloses a conveyor system with a powered diverter for diverting an object from the surface of a main conveyor to an awaiting side conveyor.
      <br/>
      The powered diverter includes an assembly of diverting wheels that are oriented toward the side conveyor.
      <br/>
      The group of diverting wheels are normally positioned below the upper surface of the main conveyor so that objects traveling on the main conveyor do not contact the diverting wheels.
      <br/>
      In order to divert an object from the main conveyor to the side conveyor, the diverting wheels are elevated so that they are slightly above the upper surface of the main conveyor.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an object traveling down the main conveyor is diverted by contact with the elevated diverting rollers.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,291,279 to DeGood likewise discloses a conveyor system with a powered diverter, which as shown in FIG. 8 works in conjunction with a shifting linkage 200.
      <br/>
      Chains of powered roller elements are used, which are indexed upwardly to engage packages to eject them at an angle from the original conveying path.
    </p>
    <p num="12">U.S. Pat. No. 3,303,923 to Davis discloses a conveyor diverter mechanism which includes a number of relatively thin conveying belts 25, 26, and 27 which are indexed upwardly as shown in FIG. 2 to engage and withdraw a selected package.</p>
    <p num="13">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,598,815 to Adama discloses a powered roller diverter which includes a single row of powered diverter rollers which can be selectively indexed upwardly to engage and eject a package on a belt conveyor path.
      <br/>
      The single row of diverter rollers is selectively indexed upwardly from within a transverse gap between the downstream roller of an upstream conveyor to the upstream roller of a downstream conveyor, such that the rollers engage and discharge a package sidewardly.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,730,718 to Fazio discloses a `bi-directional mechanism" which, as shown well in FIG. 1, shows a plurality of elastomeric belts 76 mounted upon an indexable table assembly associated with a conveyor assembly.
      <br/>
      The belts are supported by indexable rollers such that portions of the belts can be indexed upwardly within elongate slots defined between elongate conveyor rollers being part of the conveyor assembly, to cause the belt portions to engage packages otherwise atop the conveyor rollers, and to eject them to either side of the conveyor path.
      <br/>
      The Kloosterhouse patent (U.S. Pat. No. 4,962,841), owned by the same assignee, likewise discloses such a configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,979,606 to Usui discloses a transporting direction controlling device applicable to conveyor systems.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 1-5 of the Usui patent, the device utilizes a rotor member comprised substantially of a cylindrical or disk-shaped roller which is tiltable in variable directions for tilting the plane of the upper surface of the rotor member.
      <br/>
      By tilting the direction of the plane and the rotating direction of the rotor member, the transporting direction of a box or package may be changed.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 3(A)-3(D) of Usui, force is exerted on an object by tilting the plane of the rotating device so that the object will be moved in the direction tangent to the direction of travel of the upper most portion of the tilted rotating device.
      <br/>
      In practice, Usui describes using the rotating device in concert with a plurality of similar rotating devices to form a direction changing station, as shown in FIGS. 5 and 12. As shown in FIGS. 6 and 21, guide plates 116, 118, and 312 are used to define a direction change path for the object.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,165,516 to Reed discloses a three-way transfer conveyor which includes transfer belts which are selectively driven to the left and to the right at right angles to the conveyor rollers.
      <br/>
      As in the Fazio and Kloosterhouse references, the rubber belts fit into elongate transverse "gaps" between the conveyor rollers.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In some of those systems, diverter mechanisms are utilized to divert an object from the upper surface of a conveying surface by bringing the object to a complete stop overlying the diverter mechanism and then either raising the diverter mechanism or lowering the object so that the diverter mechanism comes into contact with the object.
      <br/>
      Bringing the object to a complete stop prior to being diverted causes a significant reduction in the efficiency and speed of operation of the conveyor system.
      <br/>
      Some of those systems move a diverter into the path of a moving object.
      <br/>
      Problems associated with those systems include the inability to eject objects laterally from the surface of a moving conveying system at ejection speeds which are independent of the speed of the moving conveyor system.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Other limitations in the prior art include an inability to eject objects laterally at a high speed without encountering rotation of the package or object as it is discharged from the surface of the moving conveyor.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, such systems may be noisy and relatively difficult to repair when diverter systems components fail.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Finally, some prior art systems are complex in construction and require substantial disassembly in order to replace the discharge elements should they wear out.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Thus, there is a need in the art for a sorting conveyor system that can discharge or eject an object from a conveying surface without bringing the object to a stop and without changing the position or speed of the conveying surface.
      <br/>
      There is also a need in the art for a sorting conveyor system that can discharge or eject an object from a conveying surface at high speeds and without undesired rotation of the object during discharge.
      <br/>
      There is further a need in the art for a sorting conveyor system that is quiet during operation and which is easily repaired.
      <br/>
      Finally, there is a need in the art for a conveying device which allow for quick changes of replacement parts in order to reduce downtime.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">
      The present invention seeks to provide an improved system for efficiently discharging items of various sizes and weights from a moving conveying surface.
      <br/>

    <p num="37">
      FIG. 1 is a top plan view of an automated sorting system embodying the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a side diagrammatic view of the automated sorting system of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 is a side diagrammatic view of a cog belt conveyor system showing a self-tensioning gear motor drive system.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 is an end view of part of the gear motor drive system of FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 is a side elevation view of a portable gear motor mounted on a wheeled table.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 is an end view of a discharge drum ejection mechanism of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 is an end view of the discharge drum ejection mechanism of FIG. 6, showing a parcel being discharged to a discharge chute.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 is a top plan view of a discharge drum of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9 is a top plan view of a roller bed sorting system embodying the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 is a top plan view of a tapered discharge drum of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 11 is a transaxial cross-sectional view of the tapered discharge drum of FIG. 10.
      <br/>
      FIG. 12 is a top plan view of a portion of a conveyor system according to the present invention, illustrating an ejection disc 100 located between upstream and downstream conveyor belt assemblies 120, 121, respectively. A parcel 12 (also known as a package 12) is shown approaching the ejection disc 100. If the ejection disc 100 ejects the parcel 112, the parcel will be urged into the area of a side chute 114. If the ejection disc 100 does not eject the parcel 112, the parcel will be passed from upper conveyor belt assembly 120 to lower conveyor belt assembly 121.
      <br/>
      FIG. 13 is an "upstream" illustrative sectional view of the configuration of FIG. 12, looking along the conveying axis, showing an ejection disc 100 ejecting a package to the viewer's right. The ejection disc 100 is shown in round solid line outline, although as shown by the dotted line a flat spot 102 is included which exists if a truncated section is provided as discussed later.
      <br/>
      FIG. 14 is a side elevational view of a portion of a conveying configuration according to the present invention. A package 212 is moved from conveyor belt assembly 220 to a downstream conveyor belt assembly 221. As may be seen, the two conveyor belts include substantially planar upper conveying surfaces, which lie substantially along the same horizontal plane. A first embodiment of an ejection disc 200 is positioned intermediate the two belts, and is configured such that its selective rotation causes a portion of the disc to be moved upwardly into the path of the package (preferably from below the package), such that the package is discharged sidewardly relative to the two conveying belts.
      <br/>
      FIG. 15 shows an isolated view of the 12" diamater ejection disc 200 as viewed from its downstream side and a flat section 202. As may be seen, when the ejection disc 100 is in its normal position, the flat section allows passage of the package. However, when the ejection disc 200 is rotated, the curved peripheral edge 201 of the ejection disc 100 rises above the conveying surface, causing interference with a package moving along its conveyor path and preferably discharging the package.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 16 and 17 are views similar to FIGS. 14 and 15, respectively illustrate what happens when the ejection disc is rotated 180 degrees about its rotational axis from that shown in FIGS. 14 and 15. As may be seen, when the ejection disc 200 is actuated through such rotation, its curved edge (having a grip surface) rises above the conveyor surface, causing the package to be lifted. As the ejection disc 200 is likewise rotating, this engagement causes the package to encounter a force substantially 90 degrees in relation to the conveying axis of the package.
      <br/>
      FIG. 18 is a side elevational view of a second disc embodiment of the present invention, illustrating a parcel 312 being passed from an upstream conveyor belt assembly 320 towards a lower conveyor belt assembly 321. An ejection disc 300 is shown contacting the underside of the package 312, being indexed upwardly by use of an actuator 340, which actuates a pivoting support member 333, which supports a motor 330, which rotatably drives a shaft 331, which is substantially rigidly attached to the ejection disc 300.

    <p num="41">
      A feed conveyor 53 is provided for automatically loading objects, such as parcel 40, onto the cog belt conveyor system 20.
      <br/>
      A centering roller bed 50 is interposed between the feed conveyor 53 and the cog belt conveyor system 20.
      <br/>
      The centering roller bed 50 is comprised of a plurality of rollers 52 configured in a herringbone configuration.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the roller bed 50 serves to center and properly orient an object such as a parcel 40 onto the parallel cog belt conveyors 21, as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, a plurality of discharge chutes 45 are provided adjacent to the cog belt conveyors 21 for receiving parcels 40 discharged from the surface of the cog belt conveyors 21, as will be discussed and detailed below.
      <br/>
      It should be understood, that a variety of discharge destinations may be utilized, such as bins and separate conveyors (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      An alternate configuration for the cog belt conveyor system 20 is shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In the alternate configuration for the cog belt conveyor system 20, the cog belt conveyors 21 are supported by a pair of idler rollers 35.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, the cog belt conveyors 21 of this embodiment are disposed about the idler rollers 35 such that the outer conveying surface of the cog belt conveyors 21 include cog teeth for engagement with a self-tensioning gear motor drive system 36.
      <br/>
      The inner surface of the cog belt conveyors 21 are smooth for engagement with the idler rollers 35.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The self-tensioning gear motor drive system 36 includes a reversible gear motor 38.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, the reversible gear motor 38 is attached to a drive shaft 42 on which is disposed a pair of drive sprockets 43 for engaging and driving the pair of parallel cog belt conveyors 21.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="44">
      A tensioning mechanism 54 is provided for maintaining proper tension in the cog belt conveyors 21 of this embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, the tensioning mechanism 54 is comprised of a tension spring 55 which is retained by a spring retaining member 52.
      <br/>
      At the lower end of the tension spring 55 is a spring compression and release member 56.
      <br/>
      The spring compression and release member 56 is actuated by hydraulic cylinder 57 which contains hydraulic fluid 58.
      <br/>
      As is well known to those skilled in the art, a suitable pneumatic cylinder may be used in place of the hydraulic cylinder 57.
      <br/>
      Tension in the cog belt conveyors 21 may be increased by manually actuating the hydraulic cylinder 57, or operation of the tensioning mechanism 54 may be directed by a programmable logic controller (not shown).
      <br/>
      It should be understood, that a variety of tension spring mechanisms may be used in place of the tensioning mechanism 54 for manually or automatically maintaining constant tension in the cog belt conveyors 21.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Referring now to FIGS. 4 and 5, a portable gear motor 60 is provided for powering the sprockets 40 and cog belt conveyors 21 in the event of a failure of the reversible gear motor 38.
      <br/>
      As show in FIG. 4, the portable gear motor 60 is mounted on a wheeled table 63 to allow the portable gear motor 60 to be moved into any desired position.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, an emergency drive sprocket 68 is disposed on the end of the drive shaft 42 opposite the reversible gear motor 38.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the portable gear motor 60 includes a drive sprocket 69 for engagement with the emergency drive sprocket 68.
      <br/>
      A power cord 72 is included for providing power to the portable gear motor 60.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Referring now to FIGS. 1, 2, 6 and 7, the sorting system 10 includes a plurality of ejection mechanisms 80 for ejecting an object, such as a parcel 40, laterally from the upper surface of the cog belt conveyors 21 to an adjacently disposed discharge destination, such as a chute 45, or other desired discharge destination, such as a bin, or alternate conveyor.
      <br/>
      The ejection mechanism 80, shown in FIGS. 1 and 6, is disposed medially of the parallel cog belt conveyors 21.
      <br/>
      The ejection mechanism 80 is mounted subjacent to the upper surface of the cog belt conveyors 21.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The ejection mechanism 80 includes a discharge drum 85 and a discharge drum drive motor 87, as shown in FIGS. 6, 7 and 8.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 6 and 8, the discharge drum 85 is an elongate member defining a generally rectangular transaxial cross-section and having upper and lower surfaces 89a and 89b.
      <br/>
      The discharge drum 85 has first and second opposing sides 86a and 86b. which are disposed adjacent to the upper and lower surfaces 89a and 89b.
      <br/>
      The first and second opposing sides 86a and 86b are generally convex shaped and are separated by the longer cross-sectional diameter of the discharge drum 85.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      As shown in FIGS. 6, 7 and 8, a plurality of flexible ridges 92 are disposed along the surfaces of the convex opposing sides 86a and 86b of the discharge drum 85.
      <br/>
      The flexible ridges 92 may be made from any suitable polymer material such as polyurethane.
      <br/>
      As will be discussed below, the flexible ridges 92 assist in ejecting an overlying object, such as the parcel 40 from the conveying surface of the cog belt conveyors 21.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      A discharge drum drive shaft 88 is configured through the central longitudinal axis of the discharge drum 85.
      <br/>
      A discharge drum drive sheave 93 is attached to one end of the discharge drum drive shaft 88, as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 6, a reversible discharge drum drive motor 87 includes a drive motor sheave 96 for driving a drive belt 90 to impart rotation to the discharge drum 85.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 1, 6 and 7, the axis of rotation of the discharge drum 85 is defined by the discharge drum shaft 88.
      <br/>
      The axis of rotation of the discharge drum 85 lies along the axial center of the path of travel of the cog belt conveyors 21.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the axis of rotation of the discharge drum 85 remains fixed beneath the conveying surfaces of the cog belt conveyors 21.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In operation, the ejection mechanism 80 is used to discharge an object such as the parcel 40 from the upper surface of the cog belt conveyors 21, as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      The configuration of the ejection mechanism 80, as shown in FIG. 6, represents the rest state of the ejection mechanism 80.
      <br/>
      When the ejection mechanism is at rest, as illustrated in FIG. 6, the upper surface 89a of the discharge drum 85 is in the up position, as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      In this configuration, the upper surface 89a lies subjacent to the conveying surfaces of the cog belt conveyors 21.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an object, such as a parcel 40, may freely travel over the ejection mechanism 80, if desired.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In order to eject the parcel 40 to an adjacent chute 45, as shown in FIG. 7, the discharge drum drive motor 87 is energized when the parcel 40 moves into a position immediately above the ejection mechanism 80.
      <br/>
      If it is desired that the parcel 40 be discharged to a chute 45 located to the right of the ejection mechanism 80, the discharge drum drive motor is energized so that the discharge drum rotates in a clockwise manner, as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      It should be understood, however, that the parcel 40 may be discharged to the chute 45 located to the left of the ejection mechanism 80 by reversing the polarity on the discharge drum drive motor 87 in a manner well known to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      As shown in FIG. 7, energization of the discharge drum drive motor rotates the discharge drum 85 clockwise or counterclockwise, as desired.
      <br/>
      As the discharge drum 85 rotates, one of the two convex opposing sides 86a rotates through an arcuate path.
      <br/>
      The arcuate path begins below a plane defined by the upper surface of the cog belt conveyors 21 and rises above that plane through an opening defined by the space between the cog belt conveyors 21 or between the roller arrays, shown in FIG. 9 and discussed below.
      <br/>
      The arcuate path then terminates below the plane defined by the surface of the cog belt conveyors 21.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Accordingly, one of the convex opposing sides 86a contacts the lower surface of the parcel 40, as shown in FIG. 7, and lifts the parcel 40 up and away from the surface of the cog belt conveyors 21.
      <br/>
      The flexible ridges 92 disposed on the surfaces of the convex opposing sides provide contact surfaces to assist in movement of the parcel 40 by increasing friction between the convex opposing side and the parcel 40.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      As the discharge drum 85 continues to rotate, the parcel 40 is tilted away from the upper surfaces of the cog belt conveyors 21 and onto an idler roller 46 interposed between the cog belt conveyors 21 and the chutes 45, as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Finally, as the discharge drum 85 completes a full 180 degrees of rotation, the parcel 40 is translated onto the chute 45 and off the conveying surfaces of the cog belt conveyors 21.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, rotation of the discharge drum 85, as described, lifts, tilts, and translates the parcel 40 from the conveying surfaces of the cog belt conveyors 21, and such rotation returns the discharge drum to a rest position, as shown in FIG. 6.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      As shown in FIG. 9, an alternate embodiment of the present invention provides an ejection mechanism 80 disposed beneath the conveying surface of a roller bed conveyor 100.
      <br/>
      The roller bed conveyor 100 defines a pair of spaced-apart arrays of rollers.
      <br/>
      It should be understood that the rollers may be powered or non-powered idler rollers.
      <br/>
      The rollers define axes of rotation which are transverse to the axis of rotation of the discharge drum 85.
      <br/>
      The roller bed conveyor 100 and ejection mechanism 80 may be positioned adjacent to desired discharge destinations and interposed between two belt conveyors 105 and 110, or the ejection mechanism and roller bed 100 configuration shown in FIG. 9 may form part of a continuous roller bed conveyor arrangement (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      A tapered discharge drum 120 is shown in FIGS. 10 and 11. As shown in FIG. 11, a transaxial cross-sectional view of the tapered discharge drum 120 shows a generally rectangular shaped discharge drum 120, defining convex opposing sides 123a and 123b separated by the longer diameter of the drum.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 10, the convex opposing sides 123a and 123b of the tapered discharge drum 120 define flexible ridges 126 and are tapered longitudinally, narrowing toward the end having the drive sheave 96 for engagement with the drum drive motor 87 via a drive belt 90, as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, the tapered discharge drum also tapers longitudinally narrowing in the direction opposite to the of travel of the cog belt conveyors 21.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the second end 125 of the tapered discharge drum 120 is wider than the first end 124.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Discharge of a parcel 40 using the non-tapered discharge drum 85, as described above, tends to rotate the parcel 40 as the parcel 40 is being discharged.
      <br/>
      Rotation of the parcel is a result of the forward movement of the parcel 40 along the cog belt conveyors 21 in concert with the lateral displacement of the parcel 40 by the discharge drum 85.
      <br/>
      More specifically, as the tapered discharge drum 85 lifts the parcel 40 off one of the cog belt conveyors 21, the other cog belt conveyor continues to urge the parcel in a forward direction, resulting in an unbalanced force that causes rotation of the parcel 40.
      <br/>
      If desired, the tapered discharge drum 120 may be utilized to counteract rotation of the parcel 40 as it is discharged from the cog belt conveyors 21, as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      That is, as a parcel 40 is discharged from the surface of the cog belt conveyors 21 by the tapered discharge drum, the parcel 40 is contacted first by the wider second end 125 of the tapered discharge drum 120 which urges the parcel 40 in a direction counter to the direction of rotation caused by the cog belt conveyor 21.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the parcel 40 is discharged from the conveying surfaces of the cog belt conveyors 21 without undesired rotation.
    </p>
    <p num="58">It should be understood the ejection mechanism need not be a drum and that the side of the ejection mechanism that engages the parcels 40 need not be a continuous surface.</p>
    <p num="59">
      The automated sorting system 10 is operated under the control of a digital controller, which may be a programmable logic controller (PLC) or a general purpose microprocessor which is found in a personal computer.
      <br/>
      Methods for programming such controllers to operate a sorting system of the type disclosed herein are conventional and known to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      In operation, the number of and location of ejection mechanisms 80 and an identification code for each ejection mechanism 80 are input into the controller memory when movement of the sorting system 10 begins.
      <br/>
      Parcels 40 are induced sequentially onto the roller bed 50 from the feed conveyor 53, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, a destination code for each parcel 40 is entered into the controller memory using an optical reader 51, a keypad (not shown), or a voice recognition input device (not shown) before the parcel 40 is directed onto the cog belt conveyor system 20.
      <br/>
      A suitable optical reader system 51 for imaging the destination code from a label affixed to the parcel 40 is shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,291,564; 5,308,960; 5,327,171; and 5,430,282 which are incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      The roller bed 50, with herringbone configuration rollers 52, centers the parcel 40 so that the parcel 40 squarely aligns about the longitudinal axis of the cog belt conveyor system 20 and on the surfaces of the cog belt conveyors 21, as shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      When the parcel 40 reaches a desired output destination, such as a chute 45 in a position overlying a desired ejection mechanism 80, the PLC energizes the discharge drum drive motor 87 to actuate the ejection mechanism 80.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the discharge drum 85 rotates in the direction of the chute 45.
      <br/>
      As the discharge drum 85 rotates about the discharge drum drive shaft 88, one of the first and second convex shaped opposing sides arcuately translates between the pair of continuous cog belt conveyors 21 and above the upper surface of the continuous cog belt conveyors 21.
      <br/>
      The discharge drum 85 rotates in the direction of the chute 45, and the parcel 40 is lifted from the surfaces of the cog belt conveyors 21, as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      As the discharge drum 85 continues to rotate in the direction of the chute 45, the parcel 40 is tilted on to the idler roller 46, as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Finally, as the discharge drum completes its rotation, as described in detail above, the parcel 40 is discharged onto the chute 45, as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      After the parcel 40 is discharged to the chute 45, the discharge drum 85 stops in a rest position, as shown in FIG. 6, and stands ready to discharge a subsequent parcel 40.
      <br/>
      If it is desired that package rotation be counteracted as the parcel is discharged to the chute 45, a tapered discharge drum 120 may be utilized instead of the discharge drum 85, as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Use of the ejection mechanism 80, as described, allows the parcel 40 to be discharged from the surfaces of the cog belt conveyors 21 independent of the speed of the parcel 40 moving along the cog belt conveyors 21.
      <br/>
      Additionally, interaction of the flexible ridges 92 disposed along the surfaces of the convex opposing sides of the discharge drum 85 or the tapered discharge drum 120 reduces noise created by the impact of the discharge drum 85 with the overlying parcel 40.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, failure of an individual ejection mechanism 80, or the cessation of use of an individual ejection mechanism 80 for the maintenance purposes does not create downtime for the cog belt conveyor system 20.
      <br/>
      In the event of the cessation of use of an individual ejection mechanism 80, the PLC may direct parcels to be discharged to alternate discharge destinations and bypass the stopped ejection mechanism 80.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the discharge drums may be quickly and easily replaced.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, downtime of the cog belt conveyor system 20 is reduced.

      As shown in FIGS. 12 and 13, the parcel 112 is moved along a generally straight conveyor axis 113, being first positioned atop an upstream conveyor belt assembly 120, and is conveyed towards and onto a second downstream conveyor belt assembly 121, unless it is ejected.
      <br/>
      An ejection disc 100 is rotatably located within a relatively narrow transverse "slot" or "gap" 110 intermediate the two belts of the two assemblies 120, 121 to provide the ejection.
      <br/>
      It should be understood that the gap is substantially narrow in that it is shorter along the conveying dimension that in its transverse, perpendicular dimension.
    </p>
    <p num="66">A side chute 112 is positioned at approximately 90 degrees relative to the conveying axis 113, and received ejected packages.</p>
    <p num="67">
      In FIG. 12, a parcel 12 is shown in approaching the ejection disc 100.
      <br/>
      If the ejection disc 100 ejects the parcel 112, the parcel will be urged into the area of a side chute 114.
      <br/>
      If the ejection disc 100 does not eject the parcel 112 as shown in FIG. 13, the parcel is passed from the upstream conveyor belt assembly 120 to the downstream conveyor belt assembly 121.
      <br/>
      As may be seen, the two conveyor belts within the two conveyor belt assemblies include substantially planar upper conveying surfaces, which lie substantially along the same horizontal plane.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      As shown in FIG. 13 and as discussed in detail elsewhere, the disc 100 can be round or may include a truncated section defined in part by a flat spot 102.
      <br/>
      In either case, the peripheral edge 101 of the ejection disc 100 is brought into contact with the underside of the package as discussed later, such that the parcel is discharge to the viewer's right as viewing FIG. 13.
    </p>
    <p num="69">The gap 110 can be thought of as having a thickness defined by the closest distance shown between the two conveyor belts, and can be thought to extend above, below, and to intersect the conveying axis.</p>
    <p num="70">
      FIGS. 14-17 illustrate the use of a ejection disc 200 with a flat spot defining a truncated section.
      <br/>
      Under this concept, a "truncated", disc is used which fits within the transverse slot defined by the end of one belt conveyor and the beginning of a second, downstream belt conveyor.
      <br/>
      This disc includes a truncated section which operates much the same way as the "truncated" drum described earlier.
      <br/>
      The truncated disc is rotatably mounted on a fixed axis, and selective rotation causes the disc to engage and eject a package, when rotation is suitably timed.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Reference is now made to FIG. 14, which is a side elevational view of a conveyor configuration according to the invention.
      <br/>
      A package 212 can be moved from an upstream conveyor belt assembly 220 to a downstream conveyor belt assembly 221, unless ejected by a ejection disc 200 as described below.
      <br/>
      As may be seen, the two conveyor belts within the two conveyor belt assemblies 220, 221, include substantially planar upper conveying surfaces, which lie substantially along the same horizontal plane.
    </p>
    <p num="72">As in the configuration of FIGS. 12 and 13, the ejection disc 200 is positioned within and rotates within a transverse gap 210 intermediate the two belts assemblies 220, 221.</p>
    <p num="73">
      As shown in FIG. 15, the ejection disc 200 includes a flat section 202.
      <br/>
      When the disc 200 is in its unengaging or "neutral" position as shown in FIG. 14, the flat section 202 allows passage of the package.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the disc 200 is at least partially in the conveyor path.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      FIGS. 16 and 17 illustrate what happens when the ejection disc is rotated 180 degrees about its rotational axis 205 from that shown in FIGS. 14 and 15. As may be seen, when the ejection disc 200 is actuated through rotation, its curved portion (having a gripping surface) rises above the conveyor surface, causing the package to be lifted.
      <br/>
      As the disc is likewise rotating, this engagement causes the package to encounter a force substantially 90 degrees in relation to the conveying axis of the package moving from upper conveyor belt assembly 220 to upper conveyor belt assembly 221.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      As noted above, the ejection disc 200 is rotatably mounted relative to the conveying path of the packages in contacts.
      <br/>
      This rotational axis, in the configuration shown in FIGS. 14-17, is substantially stationary, horizontal, and parallel to the conveying axis of the packages above, although slight variations may be provided as needed.
      <br/>
      The conveying axis lies substantially along a drive shaft 231 which is rotatably driven by an indexing servo motor 230.
      <br/>
      This indexing servo motor is configured to be selectively activated to rotate the disc 200 in either rotational direction, allowing ejection to be provided to either side of the conveying axis.
    </p>
    <p num="76">In one preferred embodiment shown in FIGS. 15 and 17, the outer edge of the ejection disc includes a plurality of teeth 203, which are in one preferred embodiment comprised of rubber.</p>
    <p num="77">It should also be understood that alternative configurations, which include chain or other drives allowing for the remote location of an indexing motor are contemplated under the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="78">Reference is now made to FIGS. 18 and 19, which illustrate the use of a round ejection disc 300 which is indexed upwardly above the conveying surface within the gap 310 between two conveyors by use of a pivoting action.</p>
    <p num="79">
      This configuration includes a round ejection disc 300 mounted to a shaft which is rotatably driven by a motor 330.
      <br/>
      The motor 330, which can be continuously running if desired, is mounted to a pivoting support member 333 which is pivotably mounted relative to a stationary conveyor frame member (not shown).
      <br/>
      This pivoting support member 333 is pivotably mounted about a pivoting axis which is substantially horizontal as well as transverse to and below the package conveying axis path.
    </p>
    <p num="80">A linear actuator 340 is provided which actuates the frame member 333, the motor 330, and the disc 300 from a retracted (non ejecting) position (see FIG. 18) to an extended (ejecting) position (see FIG. 19).</p>
    <p num="81">
      As may be seen, when the actuator 340 (which may be an air or other extendable cylinder) urges the disc 300 upwardly, the rotational axis 305 goes from being substantially horizontal to inclined.
      <br/>
      Hydraulic, pneumatic, or other suitable actuation means known in the art can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      The narrow, substantially circular, ejection disc 300 fits within the transverse "slot" 310 defined by the end of an upstream belt conveyor assembly 320 and a downstream and the beginning of a second, downstream belt conveyor assembly 321.
      <br/>
      The circular disc 300 is rotatably mounted on a movable rotational axis 305.
      <br/>
      While in its "neutral" position as shown in FIG. 22, the disc 300 does not contact the packages as they pass from the upstream to the downstream conveyor.
      <br/>
      However, when actuated, the disc 300, being moved upwardly to its "engaging" position shown in FIG. 21, contacts the package on its circular edge.
      <br/>
      Rotation of the disc causes the package to be discharged sidewardly.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      The above motor 330 can be reversible to allow for discharge to either side of the conveyor.
      <br/>
      If desired, the motor can be left continuously running allowing the actuator to determine when ejection occurs.
      <br/>
      The motor 330, as with all the motors described in this application can be selected as known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      This concept, shown generally in FIGS. 20-37, generally relates to the use of a "quick change" feature which allows the narrow discs be quickly removed and replaced with little or no tools and with minimal disturbance to adjacent machinery.
      <br/>
      This is very important to those operating and maintaining said machinery, in that downtime due to repairs are desired to be at a minimum.

      FIG. 20 illustrates the multi-segmented round ejection disc 400 in position within a gap 410 between upstream and downstream conveyor belt assemblies 420, 421, respectively.
      <br/>
      The ejection disc 400 is mounted to a shaft 431 which is rotatably driven by a gear motor 430.
      <br/>
      The gear motor 430 is mounted to a pivotable support member 433 and actuated about pivoting axis by an actuator 440.
      <br/>
      The pivotable support member 433 is pivotably mounted relative to an unshown stationary frame member about a pivoting axis which is substantially horizontal as well as transverse to and below the package conveying axis path.

    <p num="90">The actuator 440 has essentially two positions, an "ejecting position", and a "retracted" position, and is configured to operate such that the multi-segmented ejection disc 400 can be raised generally upwardly and downwardly within the gap 410 much as the disc 300 moved as shown in FIGS. 18 and 19.</p>
    <p num="91">
      For discussion purposes, the configuration will be assumed to have a "front" and a "back", although such terms are not to be construed as being limiting.

      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 21, the rear plate 461 includes two opposing large slots 462, and also includes two small notches 463.

      The rear flange 464 is substantially rigidly attached to the rear plate 461, by welding or other means known in the art.

      The set screw 465 allows for attachment of the rear flange 464 to the shaft 431, as known in the art.

      Reference is now made to FIG. 23, which is a pictorial isolated view of a half wheel member 402, two of which are used for each disc 400.

      Each of the half wheel members 402 includes a corresponding embedded rod 404.
      <br/>
      At the front end of each embedded rod is defined in embedded rod slot 405 or other suitable engaging means, and at the opposite, rear, end is an embedded rod hook 406 or other suitable engaging means.

    <p num="94">
      Each of the half wheel members 402 is configured mostly of molded urethane in one preferred embodiment with the exception of the metal embedded rod 404.

      Reference is now made to FIG. 24, which is an illustration of a front steel plate 450 of approximately 1/8 inch in thickness.

      This front plate includes two opposing large slots 452, and two opposing small notches 453.
      <br/>
      The opposing large slots 452 and two opposing small notches 453 of the steel front plate 450 are similar in configuration to those provided in the rear plate 461 of the rear flange plate assembly 460.

    <p num="96">
      As shown in FIGS. 27 and 28, a tension spring 470 and a "pipe" 471 are also included.

    <p num="97">
      As shown in FIG. 22, the rear flanged plate assembly 460 is mounted to the shaft 431 of the gear motor 430, by passing the collar-shaped rear flange 464 over the substantially circular outline of the shaft 431.
      <br/>
      When the rear flange 464 is positioned at its desired location, a set screw 465 is installed in order to fix the rear flange 464 to the shaft 431 of the gear motor 430.
      <br/>
      A key as known in the art provided a keyed engagement between the rear flanged plate assembly 460 and the shaft 431.
    </p>
    <p num="98">After the rear flanged plate assembly 460 is mounted to the shaft 431, the two half wheel members 402 are situated as shown in FIG. 25, and held in place by the use of a front plate 450 as shown in FIG. 27.</p>
    <p num="99">When the two half wheel members 402 are in place as shown in FIG. 26, it may be seen that the half knob segments 403 of the half wheel members 402, combine to provide substantially elliptically-shaped knobs, shown well in FIG. 26. These knobs are partially contained by the large cut outs of the front plate 450, which serves to capture the half wheel members 402 between the front plate 450 and the rear plate 461 of the rear flange plate assembly 460.</p>
    <p num="100">When installed, the embedded rods 404 of the half wheel members are configured such that their hooks 406 are engaged with the "rear" side of the rear flange plate 461, as shown in FIGS. 25 and 26.</p>
    <p num="101">After positioned as shown in FIG. 25, the front plate 450 is positioned into place as shown in FIG. 27.

    <p num="102">
      After the front plate 450 is in place, a tension spring 470 is stretched such that its two ends engage respective slots 405 in the front ends of the embedded rods 404, such that the spring ends are engaged with the respective embedded rod slots 405.
      <br/>
      However, before the spring 470 is situated into place, a pipe spacer 471 is placed in engagement with the front plate 450.
      <br/>
      The spring is then positioned into place, such that the spring is engaged at its ends with the embedded rods, and the medial portion of the spring 470 biases radially against the end of the substantially short pipe spacer 471, which biases inwardly onto the front plate 450.
    </p>
    <p num="103">As shown in FIG. 27, a curved portion is provided in the pipe spacer to accommodate the round nature of the spring, and to discourage removal of the pipe spacer.</p>
    <p num="104">
      The pipe spacer 471, in one preferred embodiment, fits about the end of the shaft 431 of the gear motor 430.

A motor 430 is used which drives the ejection disc 400, such that when the motor 430 and rotating disc 400 is pivoted upwardly by an actuator 440, the ejection disc engages and discharges packages passing gap 410.</p>
    <p num="107">Although this configuration includes the use of an pivoting configuration, if a flat spot is provided in one or both of the half wheels 402, as may be understood, no pivoting is required; the motion will be as described earlier with respect to FIGS. 14-17.</p>
    <p num="108">
      In order to change a wheel configuration, a user will disengage the spring 470 from its location, remove the pipe spacer 471, remove the front plate 450, and remove and replace as needed either or both of the half wheels 402.
      <br/>
      The front plate 450 is then positioned as shown in FIGS. 27 and 20, and the pipe spacer 471 and spring 470 are situated into place as shown in FIGS. 20, 27, and 28.
