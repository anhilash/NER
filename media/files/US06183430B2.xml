    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="14">
      Please refer to FIG. 1, which is a first embodiment of the portable bathtub massage pad according to the invention.
      <br/>
      From the diagram, one can see that the portable bathtub massage pad 1 according to the instant invention comprises:
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      a pump 4, which is placed within a hollowed cylinder 2 and connected to an AC power by a plug 6 to make it function; wherein the working procedure of the pump 4 is first sucking water into the pump 4 via water inlets 31, then pumping the water with the pump 4, and finally jetting out the water via water outlets 32, and the strength of the water jet can be adjusted by a control circuit 5;
      <br/>
      a pad 3, which is a pad of monocoque; wherein the top end of the pad is covered with a hollowed cylinder 2 for accommodating the pump and the lower part of the pad is an extended long pad according to the human height, along the rim of which pad are distributed with many water inlets 31 extending into the pad 3 to incoming water ways 33 that connect to the water intake 41 of the pump 4 while on the top surface of the long pad are distributed with many water outlets 32 extending into the long pad to outgoing water ways 34 that connect to the water exit 42 of the pump 4, so that water enters via the water inlets 31 and the incoming water ways 33 into the pump 4, gets pressurized there, and flows out through the water outlets 32 to complete a whole cycle; a control circuit 5, which is placed within the hollowed cylinder 2 and connected to a wired switch 51 via which the user is to control the strength of the pump 4.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The water jet pressurized by the pump 4 to jet out from the water outlets 32 on the pad 3 can provide a good massage effect on human bodies.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Please refer to FIG. 2, which is a second embodiment of the portable bathtub massage pad according to the invention.
      <br/>
      The most different point of this embodiment from the first one is that the water outlets 32a distributed on the pad 3 are equipped with rotational switches 7.
      <br/>
      The user can turn the rotational switches 7 to open or close the water output at his or her will.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in the effect that and the water can not enter from the water inlets 31a, the user can connect the water-input hole 35 to the tap 8 by a tube 9.
      <br/>
      The water is then sent to the pump 4a via the water-input hole 35 and a water pipe 36.
      <br/>
      This configuration can also achieve the same massage effect.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Please refer to FIGS. 3(A) and 3(B), which show the water outlet switch of the portable bathtub massage pad and its cross section according to the invention.
      <br/>
      The water outlet switch 7 is a conic rotational switch that is placed in the concave part 37 of the pad and allows the user to adjust or even close the water jet by turning the switch.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Please refer to FIG. 4, which demonstrates how to use the portable bathtub massage pad according to the invention.
      <br/>
      When the massage pad 1 of the invention is placed in the bathtub 10, the user 11 can comfortably lie on it, while the hollowed cylinder 2 for accommodating the pump 4 can be used as a pillow.
      <br/>
      The user can enjoy the massage due to the water jet coming out of the water outlets.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Please refer to FIG. 5, which is a third embodiment of the portable bathtub massage pad according to the invention.
      <br/>
      The massage pad of the instant invention can be used in the shower room too.
      <br/>
      By hanging the passage pad 1 with the flying ring 38 above the hollowed cylinder 2 and connecting the water input hole 35 to the tap 8 by a tube 9 for water supply, the water can be pumped to jet out and massage the standing user 11.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Please refer to FIG. 6, which is a second embodiment of the portable bathtub massage pad according to the invention.
      <br/>
