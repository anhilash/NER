    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a pick-up truck with multi-position tailgate and more particularly pertains to a multi-position tailgate that allows better performance including air deflection.</p>
    <p num="2">
      The use of pick-up trucks is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      More specifically, pick-up trucks heretofore devised and utilized for the purpose of hauling various items are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="3">By way of example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,863,213 to Deaver discloses a spoiler, attachable to the tailgate of a pickup truck to improve the aerodynamics of the vehicle and to protect the tailgate from damage. U.S. Pat. No. 5,076,636 to Buck discloses a spoiler attachable to the tailgate of a pickup truck for aerodynamic benefit. U.S. Pat. No. 4,159,843 to Crossman discloses a pickup truck air deflector fitted to the cab of the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="4">While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objective and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not describe a pick-up truck with multi-position tailgate for allowing for better performance including air deflection.</p>
    <p num="5">In this respect, the pick-up truck with multi-position tailgate according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in doing so provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of allowing for better performance including air deflection.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Therefore, it can be appreciated that there exists a continuing need for a new and improved pick-up truck with multi-position tailgate which can be used for allowing for better performance including air deflection.
      <br/>
      In this regard, the present invention substantially fulfills this need.
    </p>

      <br/>
      FIG. 4 is a side view of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The same reference numerals refer to the same parts through the various figures.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="21">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular, to FIGS. 1 through 4 thereof, the preferred embodiment of the new and improved pick-up truck with multi-position tailgate embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference number 10 will be described.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Specifically, it will be noted in the various Figures that the device relates to a pick-up truck with multi-position tailgate for allowing for better performance including air deflection.
      <br/>
      In its broadest context, the device consists of a pick-up truck, a tailgate, a pair of side tracks, and a spoiler.
      <br/>
      Such components are individually configured and correlated with respect to each other so as to attain the desired objective.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The pick-up truck 12 has a rearwardly extending bed 14.
      <br/>
      The bed 14 is defined by an open upper end 16, a closed lower end 18, opposed side walls 20, and an open outer end 22.
      <br/>
      The open outer end 22 has a pair of apertures 24 in opposing sides thereof.
      <br/>
      The pick-up truck 12, although shown only partially in the Figures, is designed similar to those known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The tailgate 26 is coupled with respect to the open outer end 22 of the bed 14 of the pick-up truck 12.
      <br/>
      The tailgate 26 has a pair of protrusions extending outwardly from opposing ends thereof for removably engaging the pair of apertures 24 of the open outer end 22 to facilitate a hinged coupling with the pick-up truck 12.
      <br/>
      Thus, the hinged coupling allows the tailgate 26 to be lowered so as to be on the same plane as the closed lower end 18 of the bed 14.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the tailgate 26 is provided with a locking mechanism that would allow the tailgate 26 to be fixedly engaged to the open outer end 22.
      <br/>
      The tailgate 26 has a pair of tabs 28 extending outwardly of the opposing ends.
      <br/>
      The pair of tabs 28 each have an elongated bracket 30 extending outwardly therefrom.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The pair of side tracks 32 are secured to the opposed side walls 20 of the bed 14 of the pick-up truck 12.
      <br/>
      The pair of side tracks 32 slidably receive free ends of the elongated brackets 30 of the tailgate 26 whereby the tailgate 26 can be moved into a raised orientation.
      <br/>
      Note FIGS. 2 and 4.
      <br/>
      To raise the tailgate 26, the protrusions would be disengaged from the apertures 24 and the user grasps the lower end of the tailgate 26 and raises upwardly whereby the elongated brackets 30 would slide with respect to the pair of tracks 32 to allow the tailgate 26 to be raised.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The spoiler 34 is pivotally coupled with a lower end of the tailgate 26.
      <br/>
      The spoiler 34 can be raised upwardly once the tailgate 26 is raised thereby providing proper air resistance.
      <br/>
      Note FIGS. 2 and 4.
      <br/>
      When the tailgate 26 is lowered, the spoiler 34 simply is directed downwardly.
      <br/>
      Note FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      As to the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="28">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and the manner of operation, assembly and use, are: deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention.
      <br/>
      Further, since numerous modification and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modification and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.
