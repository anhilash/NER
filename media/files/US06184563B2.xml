      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This invention relates generally to the structure and fabrication process of a Schottky barrier rectifier.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to a novel Schottky device structure and fabrication process where a requirement of p-ring is eliminated and meanwhile the forward current is enhanced and the reverse breakdown voltage is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Conventional rectifier with a Schottky barrier configuration is limited by the technical difficulties of low efficiency, low switching speed, and low reverse breakdown voltage.
      <br/>
      These difficulties hinders practical applications of the Schottky rectifiers in modern electronic devices when the operational voltage drops from twelve volts to five volts and further down to three volts and lower voltages when the technology moving toward quarter micron feature size and beyond.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      FIG. 1 shows a cross sectional view of a conventional Schottky barrier rectifier 10.
      <br/>
      An N-layer 20 is supported on a N+ substrate 15.
      <br/>
      In the N-layer 20 a p-ring 25 is formed to eliminate the sharp edge effects between the metal layers 30 and the top surface above the N-layer.
      <br/>
      The requirement to form the P-ring 25 in the N-layer 20 is to prevent a reverse breakdown due to the sharp edges formed between the metal layer 30 and the top surface of the N-layer 20.
      <br/>
      However, due to the requirement of providing the p-ring 25, the thickness of the N-layer is limited.
      <br/>
      The forward voltage Vf and the forward current If are limited.
      <br/>
      Additionally, due to the p-n junction formed between the P-ring 25 and the N-layer 20, the switching speed of the Schottky rectifier is adversely affected.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,686,753, entitled "Schottky Barrier Diode having a Mesa Structure" Miyata el al. disclose a Schottky barrier diode as that shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      It includes a compound semiconductor substrate having an N+ layer and an N- layer with the N- layer supported on the N+ layer.
      <br/>
      The N- layer is configured in a form of a mesa, which has a skirt portion and a slant portion.
      <br/>
      The diode further includes an insulation layer formed on the skirt portion and the slant portion of the mesa.
      <br/>
      An anode is formed on the insulation layer and the N- layer.
      <br/>
      A cathode is formed on the N+ layer.
      <br/>
      Even with a mesa shape, Miyata's Schottky barrier diode still faced with the problem of sharp edge effect between the anode layer and the N- layer.
      <br/>
      A reverse breakdown problem would hinder practical application of the device as disclosed in the patent.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Therefore, a need still exits in the art of design and fabrication of the Schottky rectifiers, particularly for low voltage rectifiers, to provide a structure and fabrication process that would resolve these difficulties.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it is preferably that a Schottky rectifier with a high efficiency can be produced with effective prevention against reverse breakdown without causing a slow down of the switching speed.
      <br/>
      It is further desirable to employ a simplified manufacture process to reduce the production costs such that a high quality high performance Schottky rectifier can be economically applied.

    <p num="18">
      FIG. 3A is a cross sectional view of a novel Schottky barrier rectifier 100 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The rectifier 100 is supported on an N+ substrate 105 with an N- epitaxial layer 110 disposed on top over the N+ substrate 105.
      <br/>
      The rectifier 100 further includes a trench 115 disposed near the peripheral inside a die separation lines 170 separating the substrate 105, i.e., a semiconductor wafer, into a plurality of dies.
      <br/>
      The trench is filled with a three-layer filler-structure.
      <br/>
      The bottom layer is a thin polysilicon layer 120 of high resistance for reducing charge buildup.
      <br/>
      The middle layer is a nitride layer 125 for increasing the reliability of the device by acting as a barrier layer for preventing sodium or other contaminants to enter into the rectifier.
      <br/>
      The top layer is an insulation layer 130 such as a silicon dioxide layer filling the trench.
      <br/>
      After the trench is filled with insulation layer 130, a chemical mechanical polish (CMP) process is employed to polish the wafer.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The Schottky rectifier 100 further includes an anode electrode 150 disposed above and in electrical contact with the N- epitaxial layer 110.
      <br/>
      The anode electrode 150 in a preferred embodiment is formed with a three-layer structure.
      <br/>
      The bottom layer 135 is a barrier metal layer for securely attaching to the N- layer 110.
      <br/>
      The middle layer 140 is a diffusion barrier layer for preventing the contact metal layer 145, i.e., the top layer, to diffuse to the barrier layer 135.
      <br/>
      The top layer 145 is composed of metals such as silver, nickel, or other metals, which can be employed for die attachment.
      <br/>
      The anode electrode 150 has the edges disposed above the insulation filling material 130.
      <br/>
      By providing the trench 115 filling with insulation material 130 near the die separation lines 170 and by disposing the edges of the anode electrode 150 above the insulation material 130 then followed by etching the insulation layer 130 by a photolithography and etch process.
      <br/>
      Backside ohmic contact 160 is formed by sputtering, chemical evaporation, or plating of a metal layer 160 on the bottom side of the substrate.

      FIG. 3B is a cross sectional view for an alternate preferred embodiment of a Schottky rectifier 100'. The structure of this rectifier 100' is basically the same as the rectifier 100 shown in FIG. 3A. The only difference is that this rectifier 100' has a Schttoky barrier height reduction region 170 formed right below the top surface of the substrate underneath the anode electrode 150.
      <br/>
      This Schttoky barrier height reduction region 170 has high N-dopant concentration to reduce the Schottky barrier height and can reduce the forward resistance.

      FIG. 3C is a cross sectional view for showing an alternate preferred embodiment of a Schottky rectifier 200.
      <br/>
      The structure of this rectifier 200 is very similar to the structure of the rectifier 100 as that shown in FIG. 3A. The only difference is that etch of the metal layer overlying the top surface is carried out first to form the anode electrode 250.
      <br/>
      Then the metal electrode is employed as a mask to etch the trench.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      FIG. 3D is an alternate preferred embodiment of a Shottky rectifier 200' has almost identical structure as rectifier 200.
      <br/>
      The only difference is a Schottky barrier height reduction region 260 formed right under the top surface of the substrate below the anode electrode 250.

      According to FIGS. 3A to 3D and the above descriptions, this invention discloses a Schottky barrier rectifier 100 formed in a semiconductor chip 105 of a first conductivity type having a cathode electrode 160 connected thereto near a bottom surface of the semiconductor chip 105.

    <p num="23">
      Please refer to FIGS. 4A to 4G for the processing steps carried out to manufacture a Schottky rectifier 100 of this invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4A, the processing steps begins by first growing a N- epitaxial layer 110 with a resistivity ranging from 0.1 to 10.0 ohm-cm on top of a N+ substrate 105.
      <br/>
      The substrate has a resistivity of 0.001 to 0.05 ohm-cm. The resistivity of the epitaxial layer 110 depends on the device requirements for the on-resistance and breakdown voltage.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the thickness of the epi-layer 110 is about one to ten microns (1-10  MU m).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring to FIG. 4B, a photoresist (not shown) is employed as a trench mask to perform a trench etch process, which is a dry anisotropic etch process, to form trenches 115 of 2 to 20 micrometers in width and 2 to 15 micrometers in depth.
      <br/>
      The photoresist is then removed.

    <p num="25">
      In FIG. 4C, a thin polysilicon or amorphous silicon film 120 of high resistivity over 106 ohm-cm with a thickness ranging from 50 to 1000 Angstroms is formed by a chemical vaporization deposition (CVD) process.
      <br/>
      The purpose of this high-resistive polysilicon layer 120 is to reduce the charge build-up, which will be further explained below.
      <br/>
      A barrier layer 125, e.g., a thin nitride layer ranging from 50 to 500 Angstroms, is then deposited on top of the polysilicon layer.
      <br/>
      The trenches are then filled with an insulation layer 130, which can be an oxide layer or combination of oxide and spin-on-glass (SOG) to fill the trench.
      <br/>
      This oxide layer may be formed y a plasma oxide deposition process.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4D, a chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process is carried out to polish and planarize the top surface.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In FIG. 4E, a barrier metal layer 135, e.g., a metal layer of molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), etc., with a thickness of approximately 0.1 to 0.5 micrometers is first formed overlying the top surface.
      <br/>
      An intermediate metal layer 140 such as a layer of titanium (Ti), titanium-tungsten (TiW), etc. is then formed covering the barrier metal layer 135.

      In FIG. 4F, a mask is applied to perform an etching process to remove the peripheral portion of top metal layers 135, 140 and 145.
      <br/>
      The peripheral portion that is removed from the top metal layers is a portion from the middle point of the trench 115 to edges 170 of the die.
      <br/>
      After patterning of the top metal layers, an anode electrode 150 is formed on the top surface comprising three metal layers 135,140 and 145.
      <br/>
      The anode electrode 150 is formed above and in electrical contact with the N- layer 110.
      <br/>
      The anode electrode is formed with the edges disposed above the insulation trench filling material 130.
      <br/>
      The problems of vulnerable reverse breakdown near the metal-semiconductor sharp edge interfaces are therefore resolved by placing the edges of the anode electrode on top of a trench filled with insulation material.

      After the CMP process for polishing and removing layers 220, 225 and 230, the top metal layers 245 are exposed to define an anode electrode on the top surface comprising three metal layers 235,240 and 245.
