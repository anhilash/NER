    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a thin-film multilayer wiring board for being packaged in electronic devices or various types of electrical apparatus, and a process for producing such a wiring board.</p>
    <p num="3">For elevating the operating speed of computers, increase of signal transmission speed of the packaging module is an important factor.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Hitherto, a thick-film board comprising a ceramic substrate and a wiring layer principally made of W or Mo and formed on said ceramic substrate by a laminating and sintering method has been used as said module.
      <br/>
      Recently, however, attention is focused on a thin-film multilayer wiring board in which, in order to realize speed-up of signal transmission, a polyimide film with a low dielectric constant is formed as an interlaminar insulating film on the ceramic substrate, and a conductive layer is made of a highly conductive substance such as Cu, Al, Au or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="5">In recent years, however, computer performance has advanced rapidly and the number of the packaged gates has increased remarkably, entailing the necessity of increasing the number of the wiring layers in the thin-film wiring system.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Several proposals have been made on the thin-film multilayer wiring techniques, wherein a successive laminating system is generally employed.
      <br/>
      This system comprises forming a conductor layer made of Cu, Al or the like on a ceramic or Si substrate, forming via holes therein, conducting insulating layer patterning by photolithography, and making electrical connections.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Techniques for forming via holes or through-holes of 100  MU m or less in diameter are needed for said interlaminar connection.
      <br/>
      Also, fine patterns with a line width-or space width of 20-50  MU m are necessary for thin-film wiring.
      <br/>
      For instance, it is required to lay 2-5 wires between the 150-500  MU m connecting pads.
      <br/>
      In this case, the via hole diameter needs to be about 20-30  MU m. However, the limit of the hole diameter that can be formed by the currently available drilling techniques is about 70  MU m, and other means must be applied for forming the holes of smaller diameters.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Recently, attention is drawn to laser working and dry etching as suitable methods for forming fine holes such as mentioned above.
      <br/>
      Both methods are excellent in fine working, but a difference is seen between them in shape of the holes formed.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      It is known that the method using excimer laser is an excellent working method for forming fine via holes or through-holes (JP-A-60-261685).
      <br/>
      However, the projected shape of the hole formed thereby tends to taper down toward the end (base) with an angle of about 20 to 30 (degree)  against the axis of the hole.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      As a method that can eliminate the above problem, a so-called conformal mask method--a method in which laser working is performed through a mask comprising a metallic film having openings at the pattern portion of an organic insulating layer where holes are to be formed--is effective.
      <br/>
      According to this method, as shown in FIG. 2, the hole formed has a taper angle (e) of about 15-5 (degree)  against the axis of the hole when the energy density of the excimer laser is 300 to 1,000 mJ/cm2.
      <br/>
      Thus the tapering phenomenon toward the end (base) can be suppressed to a considerable degree.
      <br/>
      The result of the tests conducted by the present inventors shows that the taper angle  THETA  of the hole formed is reduced and its straightness is enhanced proportionally as the energy density increases.
    </p>
    <p num="11">On the other hand, as opposed to said laser working, according to dry etching using oxygen plasma controlled to a low gas pressure (for example, 5 Pa or less), it is possible to form an almost straight hole with a taper angle ( THETA ) less than 5 (degree) . It was found from a series of experiments that when the plasma gas pressure becomes higher than 5 Pa in dry etching of an organic insulating layer such as a polyimide layer, the hole formed is curved in section like a barrel.</p>
    <p num="12">
      Such drying etching techniques have been used for wiring or patterning of the insulating layers in the LSI semiconductor manufacturing processes.
      <br/>
      For instance, a method for forming the contact holes in the interlaminar insulating layer on a semiconductor substrate by dry etching using a reactive gas (a mixed gas of CF4, CHF3, Ar, O2, Cl, etc.) is disclosed in JP-A-4-150023 and JP-A-5-121371.
      <br/>
      In the former, the etching gas pressure for forming a straight hole is specified to be 0.6 Torr or below (80 Pa or below) while in the latter, the etching gas pressure is defined to be 10 to 50 m Torr (1.33. to 6.65 Pa).
    </p>

    <p num="51">�8� A thin-film multilayer wiring board, which comprises a substrate, formed thereon a plurality of metallic wiring layers interposing one or more organic insulating layer therebetween alternately, each land of said metallic wiring layers being electrically connected by via studs made of an electroconductive metal filled in via holes and formed by electroless plating.</p>
    <p num="52">�9� In the above-mentioned thin-film multilayer wiring board, the lands of individual metallic wiring layers are electrically connected by via studs made of a conductive metal filled in via holes and formed by electroless plating, and the difference between the top end diameter and the base diameter of each of said via studs is 10% or less, or the angle made by the interface between the insulating layer and each via stud against the axis thereof is 50 or less.</p>
    <p num="53">
      An example of the via stud-connected type thin-film multilayer board according to the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      On a substrate 1 made of ceramic or glass-reinforced epoxy is formed an insulating layer 2 (made of, for example, polyimide) having a metallic wiring layer thereon, said metallic wiring layer contacting with the substrate, and via holes are formed in said insulating layer 2.
      <br/>
      A number of insulating layers 2 each having a metallic wiring layer thereon are laminated while connecting the metallic wiring layers 4 by via studs 3 made of a conductive metal filled in said via holes and formed by electroless plating.
      <br/>
      The metallic wiring layers 4 connected successively by via studs in the manner described above are laminated, thereby forming a thin-film multilayer wiring board.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      FIGS. 3A to 3B are a flow chart exemplifying a process for producing a thin-film two-layer wiring board (production steps) by schematic sectional views.
      <br/>
      A resist 11 is formed on a substrate 1 having a metallic wiring layer 4, followed by etching (not shown) to form a first metallic wiring layer 9, and an insulating layer 2 is formed thereon and dry etched through an etching mask 8 to form via holes 7.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Then the via holes 7 are filled with a conductive metal by electroless plating.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, a metallic wiring film 4 is formed by vacuum deposition or sputtering, and a second metallic wiring layer 10 is formed by wet etching.
      <br/>
      It is possible to form a three or more layered wiring board by repeating the step shown by FIG. 3D and the succeeding steps shown in FIGS. 3E to 3H a plurality of times.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      As said insulating layer 2, there can be used a film formed by thermosetting a polyimide precursor varnish coating or a composite sheet obtained by forming an adhesive layer on a polyimide film and pressing them into a sheet.
      <br/>
      A composite sheet is preferred from the viewpoint of workability.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to use polyamides and epoxy resins as the insulating material.
    </p>
    <p num="57">In said insulating layers (polyimide) are formed the via holes each terminating into a land of the first metallic wiring layer (copper) by dry etching (using oxygen gas plasma) or excimer laser working, and a via stud is grown from the land at the bottom of the hole by electroless plating.</p>
    <p num="58">
      A reason why the electroless plating method is selected for forming the via studs in the present invention is accounted for by the fact that since in the successive laminating method a process is followed in which an insulating layer is formed on a first metallic wiring layer formed on a substrate, generally said metallic wiring pattern is an independent pattern and it is not easy to take out common electrodes as in electroplating.
      <br/>
      In electroless plating, no such common electrodes are required.
    </p>
    <p num="59">As the conductive metal for making the via studs, there can be used copper, gold, nickel, silver, etc.</p>
    <p num="60">
      An example of working of the through-holes in a double-sided multilayer printed board by electroless plating is disclosed in JP-A-5-335713.
      <br/>
      In this method, columnar conducting plating is performed in the through-holes in the insulating layer with its backside blocked with a copper foil to form interlaminar connections while at the same time the backside of the insulating layer is connected to the conductor foil on the front side.
      <br/>
      This method is effective in case the wiring pattern is relatively large and the conductor layer is also thick, such as several ten  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      However, in a thin-film multilayer wiring board in which the insulating layers are of a smaller thickness and connected by fine via studs, it is impossible to reduce the thickness of the conductor foil (wiring layer) when such a conductor foil is provided on both sides of the insulating layer as in the above case, so that it is difficult to form a fine pattern on the second metallic wiring layer by wet etching.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, therefore, a conductor foil (connecting land) is-used for the first wiring layer alone.
    </p>
    <p num="62">Regarding formation of the fine via holes for forming the fine via studs, it is possible to form the fine via holes with very high straightness with the taper angle made by the wall surface of the worked hole with the axis thereof being 5 (degree)  or less (to almost 0 (degree) ) as shown in FIG. 4 (the taper angle made with the substrate surface being 85 (degree)  or greater) by controlling the gas pressure at a low level (5 Pa or below to 1 Pa or less) that allows plasma formation.</p>
    <p num="63">FIG. 4 shows the relation between said taper angle and the partial pressure of oxygen gas of the plasma when the via holes were formed in a 20  MU m thick polyimide sheet.</p>
    <p num="64">
      When dry etching was carried out by fixing the high frequency (RF) output at 500 W and the oxygen flow rate at 15 ml/min, the taper angle was 10-15 (degree)  when the partial pressure of oxygen was 1-5 Pa.
      <br/>
      But the taper angle became greater than 150, and straightness of the formed hole was reduced, when the partial pressure of oxygen was raised to 10 Pa.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The thin-film multilayer board produced according to the above-described process showed good connecting quality (indicated by connecting rate) of the via studs.
      <br/>
      The connecting rate was high even when the via hole diameter was 60  MU m or less as shown in Table 1.
      <br/>
      It was further found that the via stud resistance was also small as shown in FIG. 5.
    </p>
    <p num="66">

    <p num="67">
      At the section of the via stud formed according to the present invention, the horizontal growth of the plating copper was confirmed even at the top end where plating was terminated.
      <br/>
      Such flatness of the via stud surface is not only conducive to the betterment of pattern forming precision of photolithography in forming the second metal wiring layer but also enables vertical connection of the second via studs.
      <br/>
      That is, on the planarly grown via stud surface, there can be formed the connecting wiring lands of the next layer, and immediately thereon the via studs of yet another layer can be placed.
      <br/>
      Since this allows a reduction of interlaminar wiring length, a speed-up of signal transmission can be attained.
    </p>
    <p num="68">It is also possible to further reduce interlaminar connection resistance by improving the flatness of the via stud surface in addition to flattening grinding and polishing treatments after formation of the via studs.</p>
    <p num="69">The via studs formed by filling the via holes with a conductive metal by electroless plating as described above showed high connection reliability in a room temperature and 300 (degree)  C. heat cycle test, and also suffered almost no change of performance in a high-temperature standing test at 300 (degree)  C. for 100 hours.</p>
    <p num="70">Due to the provision of the via studs with a diameter of 100  MU m or less (possibly to submicrons), formation of fine patterns with a line width and a space width of 20 to 50  MU m can be realized, making it possible to lay 2 to 5 wires between the 150-500  MU m connecting pads.</p>
    <p num="71">Also, according to the above-described method in which the composite sheets are bonded, as compared with the successive laminating method in which a polyimide varnish or the like is applied for forming said insulating layers, it is possible to further simplify the production process as no varnish curing step is required, and a thin-film multilayer wiring substrate capable of high-density packaging with high reliability can be offered.</p>
    <p num="72">The present invention is illustrated by way of the following Examples.</p>
    <p num="73">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="74">An embodiment of the present invention is explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
