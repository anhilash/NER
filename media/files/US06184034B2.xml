    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Controlled cell death is critical for the life of a human; too much cell death can lead to diseases such a neurodegeneration and autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) while too little cell death can lead to cancer or autoimmune diseases.
      <br/>
      Recent studies have defined the pathway of cell death as "apoptosis" and have identified some of the biochemical steps involved.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Apoptosis is a homeostatic mechanism involved in the controlled death of obsolete cells during metamorphosis, differentiation, cell turnover, and hormone mediated deletion of thymocytes (Wyllie et al.
      <br/>
      Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980 68:251-306).
      <br/>
      Apoptosis has also been identified as the mechanism of cell killing during growth factor withdrawal (Rodriguez-Tarduchy et al.
      <br/>
      EMBO J. 1990 9:2997-3002; McConkey et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1990 265:3009-3011), T-cell deletion, treatment with many cytotoxic agents (Cohen, J. J. and Duke, R. C. J. Immunol. 1984 132:38-42; Barry et al.
      <br/>
      Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990 40:2353-2362; Kaufmann, S. H. Cancer Res. 1989 49:5870-5878; and McConkey et al.
      <br/>
      Science 1988 242:256-259), and following hypothermia (Barry et al.
      <br/>
      Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990 40:2353-2362; Lennon et al.
      <br/>
      Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990 18:343-345; Takano et al. J. Pathol. 1991 163:329-336).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Central to the mechanism of apoptosis is internucleosomal DNA digestion by endogenous endonucleases.
      <br/>
      Mammalian cells contain a variety of endonucleases which could be involved in internucleosomal DNA digestion.
      <br/>
      However, it has been postulated that the primary endonuclease involved in apoptosis is a Ca2+ /Mg2+ -dependent endonuclease.
      <br/>
      Several Ca2+ /Mg2+ -dependent endonucleases have been identified, one of which is deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), (Peitsch et al.
      <br/>
      EMBO J. 1993 12:371).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Recent experiments, however, indicate that DNase I may not be the primary endonuclease involved in apoptosis.
      <br/>
      It has been found that many cells do not contain this endonuclease.
      <br/>
      The role of DNase I, or any other Ca2+ /Mg2+ -dependent endonuclease is further unlikely, as often no increase, or only a minor increase, in Ca2+ levels occurs in apoptotic cells (Eastman, A. Cell Death and Differentiation 1994 1:7-9).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      An alternate endonuclease that is active below pH 7.0 and has no apparent requirement for Ca2+ or Mg2+ has been detected (Barry, M. A. and Eastman, A. J. Natl Cancer Inst. 1990 82:749).
      <br/>
      This alternate endonuclease has been identified as deoxyribonuclease II (DNase II; Barry, M. A. and Eastman, A. Archives of Biochem and Biophys. 1993 300(1):440-450).
      <br/>
      It is believed that this enzyme is involved in the internucleosomal digestion or fragmentation of DNA which is one of the early steps in the pathway of apoptosis.
      <br/>
      Another report that has implicated DNase II in cell death involves lens fiber cell differentiation, a process where the cells lose their nuclei in a manner similar to apoptosis (Torriglia, A. et al. 1995 J. Biol. Chem. 270:28579-28585).
      <br/>
      In this process, the chromatin condenses and the cells degrade their genomic DNA.
      <br/>
      DNase II was found by immunocytochemistry to be localized in the cytoplasm but translocated to the nucleus of the fiber cell before degeneration.
      <br/>
      These findings implicate DNase II as the endonuclease responsible for genomic degradation observed during lens nuclear degeneration, and further support a role for this enzyme in mechanisms of cell death.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      DNase II has now been isolated and purified and the amino acid sequence determined.
      <br/>
      Further, the DNA sequences for both the human and bovine proteins have now been cloned.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      The existence of DNase II as a protein of lysosomal origin that is involved in cellular digestion of foreign DNA has been known for many years.
      <br/>
      Recently, this enzyme has been linked with the DNA fragmentation that occurs at an early stage in apoptosis.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The bovine and human forms of the DNase II protein have now been isolated and purified and the amino acid sequences of these proteins determined. cDNAs encoding the bovine and human form of this protein have also been cloned and characterized.
      <br/>
      The complete amino acid and nucleotide sequence of human DNase II are provided in SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO: 1, respectively.
      <br/>
      This cloning was performed by first purifying the bovine protein, sequencing a stretch of amino acids, as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 4, and using molecular biology techniques well known to those of skill in the art to isolate a portion of the bovine cDNA sequence, as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 2.
      <br/>
      Nine hundred and twenty-seven bases of the bovine cDNA sequence were obtained.
      <br/>
      The predicted translation of the sequence gave 276 amino acids of which 21 amino acids were upstream of the initial serine obtained by protein sequencing.
      <br/>
      No initiator methionine codon was found in the 21 amino acids upstream.
      <br/>
      However, the codon for an aspartate residue was found to be present immediately upstream of the amino terminal serine thus indicating that DNase II is produced as a larger protein which is post-translationally modified at this aspartate residue to produce the acid-activated 31 kDa protein.
      <br/>
      The potential active site of porcine DNase II had been previously purified and sequenced and consisted of an octomer, ATEDHSKW (SEQ ID NO: 5) (Liao, T. -H. 1985 J. Biol. Chem. 260:10708-10713).
      <br/>
      The cDNA coding for this octomer is found in the bovine sequence and comprises amino acids 184-191.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      This bovine sequence was then used to isolate the human sequence.
      <br/>
      The bovine cDNA sequence was compared to sequences in the GenBank database and was found to be homologous to three overlapping human ESTs.
      <br/>
      The human ESTs was used to design primers to amplify human cDNA from a U937 cell line cDNA library.
      <br/>
      Additional upstream human cDNA sequence was obtained from 4 separate clones that had significant homology to bovine sequence.
      <br/>
      A primer was designed using sequence that was 5', Hfor3, and used in a PCR with the Revcon1 primer to amplify a 357 bp fragment of DNase II to be used as a probe for screening of Northern Blots and human cDNA libraries.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Total RNA from 5 human cell lines was analyzed by Northern Blotting.
      <br/>
      A message of approximately 2 kb was detected in the human myeloid cell line ML-1, and the human breast carcinoma lines MDA-231, T47D, and MCF7.
      <br/>
      However, no signal was detected from the epithelial carcinoma HeLa cell RNA, a cell line that does not readily undergo DNA laddering during apoptosis.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A lambda Zap HepG2 cDNA library, an ML-1 cDNA library, and a lambda Unizap human macrophage cDNA library were all screened with this 357 bp probe.
      <br/>
      No full length clones were isolated from the HepG2 and ML-1 libraries.
      <br/>
      However, two unique clones containing over 1.9 kb of sequence were isolated by screening the human macrophage cDNA library.
      <br/>
      These were sequenced and found to contain identical open reading frames coding for 360 amino acids and a large 3' untranslated region.
      <br/>
      There was high amino acid homology observed between bovine and human DNase II.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Using the human cDNA sequence of the present invention, it has now been found that the gene for DNase II is present on chromosome 19p13.2. Homologs for DNase II were found in other species, including ESTs in mouse, drosophila, and C. elegans.
      <br/>
      The only other proteins displaying significant homology to the human sequence were three genomic homologs identified in C. elegans, two of them located on chromosome II and the third on the X chromosome.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The effect of overexpression of the full-length human cDNA was examined.
      <br/>
      In these experiments vectors expressing DNase II in the sense and antisense orientation were transfected into Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.
      <br/>
      These cells were then selected for neomycin resistance conferred by the vector.
      <br/>
      Many colonies were detected in plates transfected with vector alone or vector expressing the antisense construct.
      <br/>
      However, no colonies were detected in plates transfected with the sense construct.
      <br/>
      Thus, overexpression of DNase II was lethal to CHO cells.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      To determine if overexpression of DNase II causes apoptosis in transfected cells, transiently transfected cells were examined by cotransfecting a vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP).
      <br/>
      These cells were then stained with Hoechst 33342, which differentiates normal and apoptotic cells on the basis of chromatin condensation.
      <br/>
      The percent of GFP positive cells that were apoptotic were then compared for vector alone and sense vector transfections.
      <br/>
      The results showed that cells transfected with DNase II and GFP had a ten fold increase in % GFP and Hoechst positivity over cells transfected with vector alone.
      <br/>
      This demonstrates that the overexpression of DNase II results in apoptosis of mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, vectors comprising the cDNA of the present invention can be used to induce apoptosis in selected cells by transfecting selected cells with the vector and expressing the cDNA of the vector so that apoptosis is induced.
      <br/>
      In this method, selected cells would comprise unwanted cell, for example tumor cells or cells involved in autoimmune disorders.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Similar experiments to determine the consequence of decreasing expression of endogenous DNase II in cells can also be performed using antisense agents targeted to a portion of the cDNA sequence of the present invention or the corresponding mRNA.
      <br/>
      Antisense agents targeted to a portion of the cDNA of the present invention will decrease or inhibit the expression of DNase II.
      <br/>
      It is believed that these antisense agents will reduce chromosome instability associated with the formation of cancer thereby altering its pathogenic process.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Accordingly, the cDNA of the present invention is useful in identifying agents which modulate, i.e., increase or decrease, apoptosis in cells.
      <br/>
      In this method, cells from a single culture are divided in two groups.
      <br/>
      The first group, referred to as the treated cells are placed in contact with a test agent in a vehicle.
      <br/>
      The second group, referred to as untreated cells are placed in contact with vehicle only.
      <br/>
      Treated and untreated cells are then transfected with the cDNA of the present invention and apoptosis in the treated and untreated cells is monitored to determine whether treating cells with the test agent modulates apoptosis in the cells.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The amino acid sequences of the present invention are also useful in identifying agents which modulate activity of DNase II and apoptosis of cells.
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequence obtained at the start of the bovine protein unexpectedly comprises "SSSRG" (SEQ ID NO: 17).
      <br/>
      Since proteins always begin with methionine, this initial sequence indicates that the bovine protein must be processed to a smaller fragment after it is made.
      <br/>
      Comparison with the human sequence depicted in SEQ ID NO: 3 shows a very similar region, "SSMRG" (SEQ ID NO: 18) at the same location.
      <br/>
      Thus, the human protein is also presumed to undergo further processing to a smaller fragment after it is made.
      <br/>
      Further, the upstream amino acid, D (aspartic acid), is at the same location in both species.
      <br/>
      The location of this amino acid is important, as cleavage at an aspartic acid is virtually unique to proteases involved in cell death by apoptosis.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the amino acid sequences of the present invention provide the information necessary to design compounds which inhibit cleavage at this site.
      <br/>
      Such inhibitors may be useful in preventing diseases relating to enhanced chromosomal rearrangement such as cancer.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, compounds which promote cleavage of this enzyme at this point in the amino acid sequence may promote apoptosis, and may be of use in the treatment of diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The DNase II proteins of the present invention, or fragments thereof, are also useful as antigens to produce antibodies.
      <br/>
      By "antibody" it is meant to include, but is not limited to, both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies as well as chimeric, single chain, and humanized antibodies along with Fab fragments, or the product of a Fab expression library.
      <br/>
      Various techniques for producing such antibodies are well known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Polyclonal antibodies generated against DNase II can be obtained by direct injection of the isolated, purified proteins of the present invention, or fragments thereof, into an animal, preferably a nonhuman.
      <br/>
      Such antibodies can then be used to isolate the enzyme from tissues expressing that enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      For preparation of monoclonal antibodies, any technique which provides antibodies produced by continuous cell line cultures can be used.
      <br/>
      Such techniques are used routinely by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Some examples include, but are not limited to, the hybridoma technique, the trioma technique, the human B-cell hybridoma technique and the EBV-hybridoma technique.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      These antibodies are useful in studying the expression of DNase II in a variety of cells.
      <br/>
      For example, in one embodiment, an antibody of the present invention is used to detect the presence of either full-length protein or the smaller truncated protein in human cells.
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequence of the present invention also facilitates production of antibodies that recognize only the larger protein, or only the smaller protein.
      <br/>
      The antibodies of the present invention may be useful in diagnosing or determining cells at various stages in the apoptotic pathway, stages that are well known to those of skill in the art.
      <br/>
      Such diagnosis is useful in evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic agents such as anticancer agents to promote apoptosis in cancer cells.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the antibodies can be used to identify cells susceptible to premature death.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      DNase II digests DNA.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the isolated, purified human DNase II enzyme of the present invention is useful in digesting DNA by contacting DNA with this enzyme.
      <br/>
      For example, patients suffering from cystic fibrosis have viscous sputum in their lungs; accumulation of this viscous sputum can lead to suffocation.
      <br/>
      Much of this viscosity comes from the release of DNA from cells dying in the lungs.
      <br/>
      DNase I is currently used in patients with cystic fibrosis as an inhaler to digest DNA in the mucous plugs of the lungs of these patients.
      <br/>
      However, this enzyme is inhibited by actin, also present in sputum.
      <br/>
      Thus, the efficacy of this treatment is limited.
      <br/>
      Previously, DNase II would not have been considered as a practical alternative because it is active only at a pH below that of the lungs.
      <br/>
      However, the low pH activity is associated with the smaller fragment as discussed in more detail above.
      <br/>
      The full length DNase II identified by this invention may have other catalytic activities such as an ability to digest DNA at higher pH.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is believed that administration of a concentration of DNase II which causes digestion of DNA is sputum will be effective in alleviating suffering of patients with cystic fibrosis by decreasing the viscosity of the sputum in the lungs.
