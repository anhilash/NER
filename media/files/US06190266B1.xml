    <p num="2">The present invention is an ergonometric golf putter.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The golf putter performs a function different from the other clubs in a set.
      <br/>
      The other clubs are designed for moving the ball across assorted terrains, distances and hazards and are generally designed for the free flowing swing of the club head selected for the particular situation for each hole.
      <br/>
      There is a tee off, usually with a driver, and the clubs, with selected heads, to move the ball onto the green.
      <br/>
      The green presents a different golfing pattern, a substantially uniform, usually flat pattern, with short, clipped grass.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The putter, with its particular head, does not have to move the golf ball great distances, nor is the putter used for heavy swinging.
      <br/>
      The putter head is usually without an angle, because the ball does not usually have to be lifted over uneven terrain, such as along the fairway or the rough.
      <br/>
      There are many different types of putters with special shafts and putting heads and second hand grips for the control of the careful swing necessary to putt.
    </p>
    <p num="5">The prior art has included offset shafts, elongagted shafts, shafts with intermediate handles along their length, shafts with end handles and multiple shafts.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention is an improved putter which provides an egonometric gripping system.
      <br/>
      The wrist of the hand on the central handle is substantially unbent for the gripping of the second handle of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The putter is substantially the same length as prior art putters and facilitates an improved stroke.

      <br/>
      There is an upper hand grip and an intermediate, looping, substantially horizontal hand grip, extending on a plane substantially perpendicular from the back end of the putter head.
      <br/>
      The substantially horizontal hand grip requires the wrist to be twisted to face the body.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="20">
      The present invention is an ergonometric putter with a zigzag shaft.
      <br/>
      The distance from the upper handle to the putter head is substantially the same as a conventional putter.
      <br/>
      At one end of the shaft is a conventional longitudinal hand grip.
      <br/>
      A zigzag part of the shaft forms an intermediate handle for a second hand grip.
      <br/>
      The second handle is on a plane aligned with the position of the putter head.
      <br/>
      There is a linear relationship between the upper handle of the shaft and the putter head.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Although such novel feature or features believed to be characteristic of the invention are pointed out in the claims, the invention and the manner in which it may be carried out may be further understood by reference to the description following and the accompanying drawings.</p>

    <p num="27">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the putter 30 has a handle 33 on a plane with the direction of the putter head 37, but off right angulation.
      <br/>
      The angulation of the upper arm 34 and the angulation of the lower arm 35 define the length of the handle 33.
      <br/>
      The putter 30 can be used by either a right handed or left handed golfer.
      <br/>
      The putter head 37 may also have a second striking face (not shown) in FIGS. 1-4, on its opposite side.
      <br/>
      The center line B extends between the upper hand grip 31 and shaft end 36 where the shaft 32 is attached to the putter head 37.
      <br/>
      The handle 33 serves the same function as the handles 13, 53 and 73, as shown in FIGS. 1, 3 and 4, without changing the center line B of the putter 30.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The upper arm 34 and lower arm 35 of the putter 30 are both shorter than the respective upper and lower arms 14, 15 of the putter 10.
      <br/>
      Thus, the intermediate handle 33 which is integral to the shaft 32 is aligned but not parallel to the putter head 37.
