    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a pump for use in pumping fluids at very low temperatures.
      <br/>
      In more detail, the present invention relates to a pump in which the drive source, or motor, is separated from the pump by a housing and is rotatably driven by the interaction of first and second magnets acting through the housing for use in pumping fluids at very cold temperatures, for instance, for use in pumping liquefied natural gas (LNG), which has a temperature of about -263 (degree)  F. (-164 (degree)  C.).
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Liquefied natural gas (LNG) and other very low temperature fluids are of increasing, commercial importance.
      <br/>
      There is, therefore, a need for increased facility in handling, storing, and transporting such liquids.
      <br/>
      For example, LNG is being increasingly utilized as an alternative fuel source for internal combustion engines.
      <br/>
      Governmental regulations require that LNG be transported at pressures of about 30 psi, but to decrease the amount of LNG that is evaporated or otherwise lost from a stationary storage tank, it is common to store the LNG at pressures of 150 psi.
      <br/>
      When "bottled" for use as the fuel for an internal combustion engine, it is common to pressurize the LNG to pressures as high as 220 psi.
      <br/>
      Of course each increase in pressure requires that the LNG be pumped into either a storage tank or into a fuel tank at the next higher pressure such that successful use of LNG as an alternative fuel depends, in effect, upon reliable, safe and energy efficient pumping of high volumes of such fluids at very low temperatures.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Pumps presently used for pumping low temperature fluids all suffer from a variety of disadvantages and limitations which limit their life, require frequent maintenance, and otherwise decrease their utility.
      <br/>
      This is particularly true when the temperature of the fluid must be very low.
      <br/>
      For instance, pumps that are currently available for pumping LNG, but wear out quickly and need frequent maintenance and particularly require frequent replacement of the seals.
      <br/>
      Heretofore known seal-less pumps have not provided a satisfactory solution to this problems.
      <br/>
      For instance, magnetic drive pumps known in the fluid pump art, are not reliable for use at very low temperatures.
      <br/>
      Bonding material utilized on the magnets at low temperature nevertheless fails at very low temperature.
      <br/>
      In the case of LNG, severe problems result from the almost complete lack of lubrication that is provided by the LNG passing through the pump.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a pump for use at very low temperatures which is not limited by the disadvantages of known pumps.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it is a n object of the present invention to provide a seal-less magnetic drive pump for use in pumping at very low temperatures.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Another object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic drive pump useful at very low temperatures used herein to mean temperatures lower than about -100 (degree)  C. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic drive pump which is self lubricated when used for pumping, for instance, such high volume, commonly utilized fluids as LNG and liquid nitrogen.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      These objects, and the advantages, of the present invention are met by providing a magnetic drive pump for use in pumping fluids at very low temperature, below about -100 (degree)  C. and more particularly for pumping cryogenic fluids at temperatures below about -150 (degree)  C. The pump has a back plate with a rotatable shaft journaled therein.
      <br/>
      The rotatable shaft is journaled in one or more self-lubricating ball bearings comprising stainless steel balls and ball races sized for close tolerance rotation at very low temperatures and polymeric ball retainers or cages providing lubricity at very low temperatures.
      <br/>
      An impeller is mounted to the first end of the shaft, and a casing is mounted to the second end of the shaft and a first magnet is contained within a casing mounted to the rotatable shaft.
      <br/>
      The casing is comprised of a material having a coefficient of thermal expansion that is greater than the coefficient of thermal expansion of the material comprising the magnet.
      <br/>
      The back plate is mounted within a housing having openings formed therein for intake of a fluid to be pumped at low pressure and an exhaust for output of the high pressure fluid and a second magnet is positioned in close proximity exterior to the housing for rotation therearound, the second magnet being adapted for mounting to the drive shaft of a motor or other drive source for rotating the second magnet around the housing, thereby rotating the first magnet within the housing to pump the fluid.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TIE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="9">Other alterations and modifications of the invention will likewise become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the present disclosure, and it is intended that the scope of the invention disclosed herein be limited only by the broadest interpretation of the appended claims to which the inventors are legally entitled.</p>
    <p num="10">
      A preferred embodiment of a pump constructed in accordance with the present invention will now be described with reference to FIG. 1 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      That pump, indicated generally at reference numeral 10, is comprised of a back plate 12 having a rotatable shaft 14 journaled in a ball bearing 16 therein.
      <br/>
      An impeller 18 is mounted to the first end of shaft 14 by a screw 20, a key 22 positioned in the key slots (not numbered) on the rotatable shaft 14 and impeller 18 preventing relative rotation therebetween.
      <br/>
      A first magnet 24 is mounted to the second end of rotatable shaft 14 by a screw 26 and jam nut 28, the key 30 and key slots (not numbered) formed in the second end of the rotatable shaft and the magnet 24 preventing relative rotation in the same manner as the key 22. prevents relative rotation between the rotatable shaft 14 and impeller 18.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      As noted above, one of the objects of the present invention is to provide a seal-less pump which is self-lubricating so as to decrease the need for maintenance of the pump.
      <br/>
      For that purpose, the ball bearing 16 is comprised of one or more ball races 32 having balls 34 positioned therein with a ball retainer or a cage 37.
      <br/>
      The ball races 32 are comprised of an outer race 35 and an inner race 33.
      <br/>
      The balls 34 and the ball races 32 being comprised of a hard, durable material at very low temperatures such as heat treated 440 stainless steel.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the polymeric material of the cage 37 more specifically comprises a polymer having self-lubricating and "shared lubricating" properties.
      <br/>
      The polyether ether ketone sometimes known as PEEK available from ICI America (New York, N.Y.) has been found to work for this purpose.
      <br/>
      The polymer is believed to act to lubricate itself and to lubricate other parts of the bearing through a property termed herein as "shared lubricating".
      <br/>
      Applicants theorize that it is this property in the particular polymer, PEEK, that has been discovered to be useful and particularly advantageous for purposes of this invention.
      <br/>
      This property it is theorized by applicants to reside in and result from wear particles or fine "dust" from the PEEK that roll, slide or otherwise "lubricate" both between the balls and the retainer for self-lubrication and also between the balls and the ball races for "shared lubrication".
      <br/>
      It is theorized that "dust" worn off the PEEK cage 37 coats and becomes imbedded in the pores or otherwise attaches onto the surface of the stainless steel balls and on the stainless steel ball races.
      <br/>
      It may be recognize from this description that the combination of other polymers and hardened metal balls and races that will operate without brittle fracture below about -100 (degree)  C. and that have similar self-lubricating and/or "shared lubricating" properties may likewise be suitable for this use without departing from the spirit of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The construction of the bearing according to the present invention can be more fully understood with reference to FIG. 3, which is a side plan view of such a bearing as describe above, together with FIG. 4, which is a section view of the bearing of FIG. 3 taken along section line 4--4.
      <br/>
      The outer race 35 has a close tolerance grove as does the inner race 33.
      <br/>
      The balls 34 are held in rolling contact with the races at the low temperature of intended operation with close tolerance maintained by forming the races and the balls of the same material that is both hard and durable at the very low temperature of the fluid to be pumped.
      <br/>
      It has been found that 440 stainless steel is suitable for this purpose.
      <br/>
      The balls 34 are spaced and separated by cage 37, that may be formed of two circular shaped halves 37' and 37" with correspondingly positioned concave hemispherical segments 39' and 39" formed therein for defining spherical arc shaped cage chambers 39 for retaining the balls 34.
      <br/>
      The halves 37' and 37" are held together with fasteners 41, such as rivets, projecting through aligned holes and rigidly secured between the halves.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Also as noted above, a problem arises with the use of magnetic drive pumps as a result of the use of the pump at very cold temperatures in that the material comprising the magnet is unable to withstand the cold temperatures.
      <br/>
      In more detail, it is the material which bonds (or "pots") the magnetic material 36 comprising the magnet 24 to the carrier 38 which fails at cold temperatures rather than the magnetic material 36 itself.
      <br/>
      One such material is sold as part of the magnet and carrier assemblies commercially available under the brand name CHEMREX by Ugimag, Inc. (Valparaiso, Ind.).
      <br/>
      To overcome that limitation of prior art magnetic drive pumps, the magnet 24 of pump 10 is provided with a casing 40 carried on rotatable shaft 14 which is trapped between the jam washer 28 and the spacer 41 which traps the ball races 32 against the shoulder 42 formed on shaft 14 and which encases the magnetic material 36.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the casing 40 is comprised of a metallic or other material having a coefficient of thermal expansion which is greater than that of the material 36 comprising the magnet 24 so that, as temperature decreases, the material comprising casing 40 contracts at a rate faster than the rate of contraction of the material 36 comprising the magnet 24 so that the material 36 is held tightly in place on rotatable shaft 14.
      <br/>
      The magnitude or rate of thermal contraction corresponds to the magnitude of the coefficient of thermal expansion.
      <br/>
      Thus, for a casing that fits tightly on the E magnet at room temperature (i.e., both the magnet and the casing are expanded) the casing will contract faster for each degree that the temperature drops when exposed to cryogenic fluid and the casing will therefore fit tighter on the magnet when operating to pump very low temperature fluids.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Back plate 12 is mounted within a housing 44 having openings formed therein for intake and exhaust 46 and 48, respectively, of the fluid to be pumped through pump 10.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the back plate 12 is provided with a flange 50 which is confined between front and back halves 44' and 44" of housing 44 by a pumping of screws 52 (only one of which is seen in the view shown in FIG. 1), shoulders (not numbered) being provided for appropriately sized gaskets 54 for scaling the two halves 44' and 44" to the flange 50.
      <br/>
      The front interior half 44' of housing 44 forms the volute of pump 10.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      A second magnet 56 is positioned in close proximity to the housing 44--for rotation therearound and is adapted, as with a concave coupler 57 and a corresponding cylindrical shape, for mounting to a drive shaft 58 of a motor 60.
      <br/>
      When the motor 60 is operated, the first magnet 24 within the housing 44 is rotated under the magnetic influence of second magnet 56 transferred through housing 44, to drive the rotatable shaft 14 the impeller 18.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In a preferred embodiment, a frequency inverter 61 is uniquely used with the pump to not as with normal use of a frequency inverter which is to vary the speed of the motor from its standard maximum rated speed to slower speeds, but to increase the speed of the pump from the maximum standard of 3600 rpm to about 7200 rpm.
      <br/>
      This advantageously accomplishes the increased speed desired for low temperature fluid pumping simply and without the use of pulleys and a V-belt as known in the art.
      <br/>
      This increase in the speed of the motor facilitates the increase in the pressure of the fluid from pumping because head pressure is proportional to the square of the impeller speed.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, a jacket 62 is bolted between the back half 44" of housing 44 and the motor 60 for enclosing the second magnet 56.
      <br/>
      Jacket 62 is provided with an inlet and outlet 64 and 66, respectively, for purging of fluids therethrough to eliminate around housing 44 any fluid., such as liquid water, water vapor, or other constituents of ambient air that will freeze at the very low temperatures resulting at housing 44 due to very low temperature fluid being pumped therein.
      <br/>
      The purging with a dry and contaminant free fluid advantageously prevents the formation of water ice (or other frozen constituents of ambient air) around the housing 44 and between the magnets 56 and housing 44.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, as shown in hidden lines in FIG. 1, opening 66 may be closed, as with cap 67, and a desiccant material 65 may be enclosed within jacket 62, as through opening 64, to absorb water so that no moisture is allowed to condense on the moving parts inside the jacket 62, which could freeze up the motor 60.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, the desiccant 65 may be made periodically replaceable, as by treading it into opening 64, to maintain functional drying throughout the life of the pump.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      As a preventative measure to reduce the formation of areas of temperature variation and mechanical size variation caused by thermal expansion, the fluid being pumped through pump 10 is circulated within the housing 44.
      <br/>
      This interior circulation is accomplished by provision of a passage 68 in back plate 12 having a plug 70 positioned in a well 72 formed therein, the plug 70 having an orifice 74 therethrough.
      <br/>
      The orifice 74 and passage 68 allow high pressure fluid to pass from the volute formed inside the front half of housing 44' through the back plate 12 to the back half of housing 44" until sufficient back pressure builds behind back plate 12 to cause the fluid to return to the intake 46 of housing 44'. Return to the intake 46 is through the hollow shaft 14 and along the outside of the shaft 14 through the ball bearings 16 into the chamber 76 which connects through the hole 78 formed near the base of the blades 80 comprising impeller 18 (e.g., in the lower pressure portion of the volute).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 2, a second alternative embodiment of the pump of the present invention is indicated generally at reference numeral 182.
      <br/>
      In this second embodiment, all the component parts thereof are similar to those of the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 and are numbered with the same reference numeral preceded with a "1," e.g., impeller 18 in FIG. 1 corresponds generally to impeller 118 in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Pump 182 is particularly intended for use with those fluids such as liquid nitrogen which can be vented to the atmosphere and circulates the fluid being pumped internally in the same manner as does pump 10 in FIG. 1, but also provides a check valve 184 through which a portion of the pumped fluid is passed to the atmosphere through a vent tube 185 from the back half 144" of housing 144.
      <br/>
      Where the pumped fluid is known to be free of water moisture and other materials that might freeze at the low temperature of the fluid to being pumped, the vented fluid can also alternatively be captured as a purging fluid by a line 186 (shown in shadow lines to indicate that it is optional) and, which line 186 is constructed to act as a vaporizer to assure that the vented fluid is converted into warm purge gas, circulated into the inlet 164 and through the jacket 162 for the purpose of purging the jacketed volume 163 of any moisture capable of freezing.
      <br/>
      If the fluid being pumped is LNG, the pumped fluid vented through vent 185 can also be routed through a line 187 to a stack (not shown) for burning or otherwise for safe disposal or recycling of it.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Although described in terms of the above-illustrated preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art who have the benefit of this disclosure will recognize that many changes can be made to the component parts of the illustrated embodiments which do not change the manner in which these parts function to achieve their intended advantageous results.
      <br/>
      For instance, in the event that a potting material is found for bonding the magnetic material 36 of first magnet 24 at very low temperatures, it is not necessary that the magnetic material 36 be encased in the casing 40 for them to function for their intended purpose.
      <br/>
      Further, depending upon the working environment of the pump 62 and other factors known in the art, it may not be necessary to circulate moisture free purging fluid through the jacket 62 and certainly the purging fluid can be circulated through the jacket 62 in different routes.
      <br/>
      These and all other such changes are intended to fall within the spirit of the present invention as defined by the following claims.
