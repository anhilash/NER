      <br/>
      A method and apparatus for removing drill cuttings from an oil and gas well drilling platform provides for the separation of drill cuttings from at least a volume of the well drilling fluid (i.e. drilling mud) on the drilling platform so that the drilling fluids can be recycled into the well bore.
      <br/>
      The cuttings are then transferred to a cuttings collection area on the platform.
      <br/>
      The separated drill cuttings are then suctioned with a first suction line having an intake portion.
      <br/>
      The suctioned drill cuttings are transmitted to a vacuum holding tank or multiple tanks on the platform, each having a tank interior.
      <br/>
      A vacuum is formed within the holding tank interior with a blower that is in fluid communication with the tank interior via a second vacuum line.
      <br/>
      The holding tank is then connected to a floating work boat with a discharge flow line.
      <br/>
      Cuttings are then transmitted from the tank on the platform to the work boat via the flow line.
      <br/>
      In an alternate embodiment, cuttings can be transferred to an underwater storage area.
      <br/>
      In this fashion, multiple holding tanks on the drilling platform can be used to store cuttings until a work boat arrives.
      <br/>
      The work boat can be provided with its own high capacity work boat holding tank (for example 100-1000 barrels) for receiving cuttings from the multiple tanks on the drilling platform when disposal is desired.
      <br/>
      The underwater storage tank can be used in place of or as a supplement to the work boat holding tanks.

      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention relates to oil and gas well drilling and more particularly to the handling of cuttings that are generated during oil and gas well drilling activity.
      <br/>
      Even more particularly, the present invention relates to an improved vacuum tank apparatus and method for handling cuttings that are generated during oil and gas well drilling and in oil and gas exploration.
      <br/>
      Tanks are provided on an oil and gas well drilling platform and on a work boat positioned next to the platform.
      <br/>
      Both the platform and work boat have vacuum units that help transfer cuttings from the platform to the work boat.
    </p>
    <p num="7">2. General Background of the Invention</p>
    <p num="8">
      In the drilling of oil and gas wells, a drill bit is used to dig many thousands of feet into the earth's crust.
      <br/>
      Oil rigs typically employ a derrick that extends above the well drilling platform and which can support joint after joint of drill pipe connected end to end during the drilling operation.
      <br/>
      As the drill bit is pushed farther and farther into the earth, additional pipe joints are added to the ever lengthening "string" or "drill string".
      <br/>
      The drill pipe or drill string thus comprises a plurality of joints of pipe, each of which has an internal, longitudinally extending bore for carrying fluid drilling mud from the well drilling platform through the drill string and to a drill bit supported at the lower or distal end of the drill string.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Drilling mud lubricates the drill bit and carries away well cuttings generated by the drill bit as it digs deeper.
      <br/>
      The cuttings are carried in a return flow stream of drilling mud through the well annulus and back to the well drilling platform at the earth's surface.
      <br/>
      When the drilling mud reaches the surface, it is contaminated with small pieces of shale and rock which are known in the industry as well cuttings or drill cuttings.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Well cuttings have in the past been separated from the reusable drilling mud with commercially available separators that are known as "shale shakers".
      <br/>
      Other solids separators include mud cleaners and centrifuge.
      <br/>
      Some shale shakers are designed to filter coarse material from the drilling mud while other shale shakers are designed to remove finer particles from the well drilling mud.
      <br/>
      After separating well cuttings therefrom, the drilling mud is returned to a mud pit where it can be supplemented and/or treated prior to transmission back into the well bore via the drill string and to the drill bit to repeat the process.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The disposal of the separated shale and cuttings is a complex environmental problem.
      <br/>
      Drill cuttings contain not only the mud product which would contaminate the surrounding environment, but also can contain oil that is particularly hazardous to the environment, especially when drilling in a marine environment.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the Gulf of Mexico for example, there are hundreds of drilling platforms that drill for oil and gas by drilling into the subsea floor.
      <br/>
      These drilling platforms can be in many hundreds of feet of water.
      <br/>
      In such a marine environment, the water is typically crystal clear and filled with marine life that cannot tolerate the disposal of drill cuttings waste such as that containing a combination of shale, drilling mud, oil, and the like.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a need for a simple, yet workable solution to the problem of disposing of oil and gas well cuttings in an offshore marine environment and in other fragile environments where oil and gas well drilling occurs.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Traditional methods of cuttings disposal have been dumping, bucket transport, cumbersome conveyor belts, screw conveyors, and washing techniques that require large amounts of water.
      <br/>
      Adding water creates additional problems of added volume and bulk, messiness, and transport problems.
      <br/>
      Installing conveyors requires major modification to the rig area and involves many installation hours and very high cost.

    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The present invention provides a method for disposal of drill cuttings from an oil and gas well drilling platform.
      <br/>
      The method includes the steps of separating the drill cuttings from substantially all of the well drilling fluid in which the drill cuttings have been conveyed from an area being drilled.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The cuttings are then transferred to a materials collection area such as a materials trough.</p>
    <p num="17">The drill cuttings are then transported to a holding tank using a vacuum and a first suction line.</p>
    <p num="18">A vacuum is generated within the holding tank using a blower so that drill cuttings are transported from the trough or collections area to the tank via a suction line.</p>
    <p num="19">
      Cuttings are then transferred from the holding tank to a work boat via a flow line.
      <br/>
      Further treatment such as recycling of drilling mud can be performed on the boat.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The drill cuttings are typically transported directly to a holding tank via a first suction line.</p>
    <p num="21">The vacuum is generated by a vacuum generating means or blower that is in fluid communication with the holding tank via a second suction line.</p>
    <p num="22">
      The work boat preferably provides its own holding tank of very large volume such as 100-1000 barrels.
      <br/>
      The holding tank on the work boat is likewise provided with a blower that pulls a vacuum on the tank to aid in transfer of cuttings from the holding tanks on the platform to the holding tank on the work boat.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In one embodiment, the work boat simply collects cuttings transferred to it from the drilling platform.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the boat is equipped with treatment units that process the cuttings.
      <br/>
      The cuttings can be slurried on one deck of the boat and then pumped for storage to another deck area on the boat.
      <br/>
      In yet another embodiment, the boat is equipped with treatment apparatus that separates and recycles drilling fluids such as more expensive synthetics.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">
      FIGS. 1-1A and 11-12 show generally the preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention and the method of the present invention, designated generally by the numeral 10 in FIGS. 1, 1A and by the numerals 10A, 10B in FIGS. 11, 12 respectively.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, a jack-up rig type drilling vessel is shown for use with the method and apparatus of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1A, a fixed drilling platform is shown.
      <br/>
      Cuttings disposal apparatus 10 is shown in FIGS. 1-1A in an offshore marine environment that includes an offshore oil and gas well drilling platform 11.
      <br/>
      The platform 11 (FIG. 1A) can include a lower support structure or jacket 12 that extends to the ocean floor and a short distance above the water surface 13.
      <br/>
      The platform 11 can also be a jack-up rig (FIG. 1) or a semi-submersible.
      <br/>
      A superstructure is mounted upon the jacket 12 or upon jack-up rig legs 12A, the superstructure including a number of spaced apart decks including lower deck 14, upper deck 15 and in FIG. 1A an intermediate deck 16.
      <br/>
      Such a platform 11 typically includes a lifting device such as crane 17 having boom 18 and lifting line 19.
      <br/>
      In general, the concept of an offshore oil and gas well drilling platform is well known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In FIGS. 1A and 4-10, a work boat 20 is shown moored next to platform 11 for use in practicing the method of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Work boat 20 has deck 21 that supports vacuum unit 22, vacuum lines 25, and one or more storage tanks 23.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 5-10, multiple tanks are provided, designated respectively by the numerals 23A-23E in FIGS. 5-6 and designated respectively of the numerals 101, 103 in FIGS. 7-10.
    </p>
    <p num="28">The drilling platform or drilling rig 11 supports one or more tanks for holding cuttings that have been removed from the well bore during drilling, such as the plurality of rig tanks 26, 27, 28 in FIG. 1A and tanks 26, 27, 28, 29 in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The tanks 23 and 23A-23E on boat 20 are preferably very large tanks, each having a volume of between for example between 100 and 1000 barrels.
      <br/>
      The tanks 26-29 on platform 11 can be, for example, between about 50 and 1000 barrels in volume each.
      <br/>
      A suction line 24, 24A, 24B can be used to form a removable connection between the plurality of rig vacuum tanks 26, 27, 28, 29 and the boat storage tanks 23 or 23A-23E.
      <br/>
      The suction line 24 can be attached for example to a discharge manifold 31 (see FIGS. 1, 1A and 2).
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, (see FIGS. 7-10), the suction line 24 can be used to transmit cuttings from tanks 26, 27, 28, 29 to an underwater storage tank, as will be described more fully hereinafter.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 14, 15, a connection arrangement is shown for joining line 24 between platform 11 and boat 20.
    </p>
    <p num="30">During oil and gas well drilling operations, a receptacle on rige 11 such as trough 77 receives drill cuttings that are removed from the well bore and preferably after those drill cuttings have been subjected to solids control, such as the removal of drilling fluids (e.g. drilling mud) therefrom.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Cuttings in trough 77 are moved from the trough 77 to one or more of the storage tanks 26, 27, 28, 29 using a vacuum unit 30.
      <br/>
      Vacuum unit 30 is connected to suction manifold 34 as shown in FIGS. 1A and 2.
      <br/>
      Arrow 39 in FIG. 2 shows the direction of air flow in the suction manifold 34.
      <br/>
      The suction manifold 34 communicates between vacuum unit 30 and each of the rig vacuum tanks 26, 27, 28, 29 via a spool piece or suction line 35.
      <br/>
      The suction line 35 includes valve 36 for valving the flow of air from each tank 26, 27, 28, 29 to vacuum unit 30 via suction manifold 34.
      <br/>
      An additional suction manifold 37 communicates with each of the tanks 26, 27, 28, 29 and with trough 77 via suction intake 38.
      <br/>
      In this fashion, valving enables cuttings to be transmitted to any selected tank 26, 27, 28, 29.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Valves 36 control flow of cuttings between each tank 26, 27, 28, 29 and manifold 37.
      <br/>
      Pressurized air from supply header 45 can be injected into discharge line 32 downstream of valve 33 to assist the flow of cuttings.
      <br/>
      Valves 48 can be used to valve such air flow.
      <br/>
      Once vacuum unit 30 is activated, drill cuttings in trough 77 are suctioned from trough 29 using the intake 38 end of header 37.
      <br/>
      The intake end 38 of suction header 37 can be in the form of a 3"-8" flexible hose, for example.
      <br/>
      Cuttings can then be transmitted via header 37 to the desired tank 26, 27, 28 or 29.

      FIGS. 2, 3, 3A and 13 show the construction of one of the rig vacuum tanks 26, 27, 28, 29 more particularly.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3, 3A, the tank 28 is shown as a pressure vessel capable of holding a vacuum (e.g. sixteen to twenty-five inches of mercury) and having an interior 40 surrounded by cylindrically shaped side wall 41 and two dished end portions 42, 43.
      <br/>
      At the lower end of tank 28 interior 40, an auger or augers 44 can be used to transfer cuttings that settle in tank 28 to discharge line 32.
      <br/>
      The well drill cuttings can then enter manifold 31.
      <br/>
      A valve 33 can be positioned in between each tank 26, 27, 28 and discharge line 32 for valving the flow of cuttings from the tank interior 40 to discharge manifold 31.
      <br/>
      Auger 44 can be operated by motor drive 46, having a geared transmission as an interface between motor drive 46 and auger 44.

    <p num="34">
      The tank 28 in FIG. 3A has some features that are optional and additional to the tank 28 of FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Tank 28 in FIG. 3A has a cylindrically shaped side wall 41 and dished end portions 42, 43.
      <br/>
      Augers 44 can be used to transfer cuttings that settle in tank 28 to discharge 32.
      <br/>
      Drilling fluid to be recycled can be suctioned from interior 40 of tank 28 using suction line 78 that is adjustable up and down as shown by arrow 91 in FIG. 3A. The suction line 78 can be used to recycle drilling fluid after solids within the interior 40 of tank 28 have settled, leaving the drilling fluid as the upper portion of the material contained within interior 40 of tank 28.
      <br/>
      Suction line 79 fits through sleeve 80 that can be fitted with a set screw, pin, taper lock fitting or similar fitting to grasp suction line 78 at the desired elevational position.

      In FIGS. 14 and 15, a connection is shown that can be used to join the hose 24 that transmits cuttings from the rig 11 to the boat 20.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 14 and 15, the hose 24 can be in two sections, 24A, 24B that are joined together using fittings 99A-99B.
      <br/>
      Crane lift line 19 attaches with its lower end portion to fitting 96 using a hook, for example, and an eyelet on the fitting 96 as shown in FIG. 14. The fitting 96 can include a pair of spaced apart transversely extending pins 97, 98 that fit recesses 94, 95 respectively on respective saddle plates 92, 93 that are welded to the rig 11 as shown in FIG. 14. In this fashion, the rig operator can raise the lower portion 24B of hose 24 upwardly until the pins 97, 98 engage the recesses 94, 95 as shown in FIG. 15. With the hose lower end portion 94B so supported by the saddle plates 92, 93, the pins 97, 98 rest in the recesses 94, 95.
      <br/>
      A rig operator then connects the coupling member 99A to the coupling member 99B as shown in FIGS. 14 and 15. The upper end portion 24A of hose 24 can be connected to header 31 as shown in FIG. 1.

      FIGS. 7-8 and 11 shown an alternate arrangement of the apparatus of the present invention that incorporates optional treatment features on the boat 20.
      <br/>
      In of FIGS. 7, 8 and 11, the boat 20 is shown outfitted with storage tanks 103 in addition to optional processing equipment that further processes the mixture of cuttings and drilling fluids that are transmitted to the boat 20 via flow line 24.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In FIGS. 7 and 8, the vessel 20 has an upper deck 100 with a plurality of tanks 101 stored under the deck 100 in hold 102, and a second plurality of tanks 103 above deck 100 as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8.
      <br/>
      Vacuum system 22 on the boat 20 can pull a vacuum on any selected one of the tanks 26-29.
      <br/>
      Each rig tank 26-29 in FIG. 11 provides a discharge that communicates with discharge header 31.
      <br/>
      The tanks 26-29 are constructed in accordance with the tank 28 of FIG. 3 or 3A.
    </p>
    <p num="38">In FIGS. 7-8 and 11, the boat 20 is provided with optional equipment to further treat the cuttings that are collected in the plurality of tanks 103 after the cuttings or a mixture of cuttings and drilling fluid has been transferred via flow line 24 to the boat 20.</p>
    <p num="39">
      The cuttings received in the plurality of tanks 103 on the upper deck 100 of vessel 20 are further treated to slurrify the combination of cuttings and drilling fluid in order to obtain a desired particle size and a desired viscosity.
      <br/>
      This enables this further treated mixture of cuttings and fluid to be pumped into tanks 101 that are under deck 100.
      <br/>
      In this fashion, storage can be maximized by slurrifying, and storing the cuttings/drilling fluid mixture in the tanks 101 that are under deck 100 in hold 102.

    <p num="40">
      In FIGS. 7, 8 and 11, the flow line 24 transmits cuttings to header 104 that is valved with valves V so that incoming cuttings can be routed to any particular of the tanks 103 as desired.
      <br/>
      Vacuum unit 22 on boat 20 can pull a vacuum through header 105 on any selected tank 103.
      <br/>
      This is because each of the tanks 103 is valved with valves V between the tank 103 and header 105.
      <br/>
      A walkway 106 accessible by ladder 107 enables an operator to move between the various valves V and headers 104, 105 when it is desired to open a valve V or close a valve V that communicates fluid between a header 104 or 105 and a tank 103.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      By closing all of the valves V that are positioned in between a tank 103 and the vacuum header 105, the vacuum can be used to pull a vacuum on cuttings grinder unit 108 via flow line 109 (see FIG. 11).
      <br/>
      A discharge header 110 is used to communicate discharged fluid that leaves a tank 103 to cuttings grinder unit 108.
      <br/>
      Valves V are used to control the flow of fluid between each tank 103 and header 110 as shown in FIG. 11. Pump 111 enables material to be transferred from cuttings grinder unit 108 via flow line 112 to shaker 113 and holding tank 114.
      <br/>
      Material that is too large to be properly slurried is removed by shaker 113 and deposited in cuttings collection box 115 for later disposal.
      <br/>
      Material that passes through shaker 113 into holding tank 114 is slurried by recirculation from tank 114 to pump 116 and back to tank 114.
      <br/>
      When a desired particle size and viscosity are obtained, the slurry is pumped with pump 116 to one of the tanks 101.
      <br/>
      Each of the tanks 101 is valved between discharge header 119 and tanks 101 as shown in FIG. 11.

    <p num="42">When the boat 20 reaches a desired disposal facility, pump 118 receives fluid from discharge header 119 for transmission via line 120 to a desired disposal site such as a barge, on land disposal facility or the like.</p>
    <p num="43">
      In FIGS. 9-10 and 12, the apparatus of the present invention is shown fitted with optional treatment features, designated generally by the numeral 10B in FIG. 12. In the embodiment of FIGS. 9, 10 and 12, processing is used to remove desirable drilling fluid from cuttings that are transferred to boat 20 via line 24.

      In FIGS. 9, 10 and 12, the rig 11 has a plurality of tanks 26-29, and inlet header 37, a vacuum system 30, a vacuum header 34, and pumps 90 to remove desirable drilling fluid at the rig or platform 11 for recycling.
      <br/>
      However, in FIGS. 9-10 and 12, recycling of drilling fluid also occurs on boat 20.
      <br/>
      Thus, the equipment located on rig 11 is the same in the embodiment of FIGS. 11 and 12. The equipment on boat 20 differs in the embodiment of FIGS. 9-10 and 12.
      <br/>
      The boat 20 in FIGS. 9-10 and 12 includes a plurality of tanks 103 that discharge cuttings to a first conveyor such as auger 121.
      <br/>
      Auger 121 directs cuttings that are discharged by tanks 103 to a conveyor such as screw conveyor 122.
      <br/>
      Screw conveyor 122 deposits cuttings in separator 123.
      <br/>
      In separator 123, some drilling fluids are removed and transmitted via flow line 124 to recycled liquid holding tank 125.
      <br/>
      The separator 123 is preferably a hopper with a vibrating centrifuge, spinning basket driven by a motor.
      <br/>
      Such separators 123 are commercially available.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      After drilling fluid has been separated at separator 123, dry cuttings are transmitted to cuttings dryer unit 126 using screw conveyor 127.
      <br/>
      The cuttings dryer unit 126 further dries the cuttings so that they can be transferred to a vessel, barge, etc. or dumped overboard via discharge pipe 130.
      <br/>
      Any fluid that is removed from the cuttings at cuttings dryer unit 126 can be recycled through pump 128 and flow line 129 to liquid holding tank 125 and then to the platform 11 via flow line 131.
