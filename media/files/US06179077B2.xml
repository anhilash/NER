    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates generally to heat exchangers for vehicles that affect the aerodynamics of a vehicle.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method for providing a heat exchanger on a vehicle, where the heat exchanger augments and modifies aerodynamic forces.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Currently, heat exchangers on vehicles are typically placed substantially perpendicular to an air flow and towards the front of the vehicle, which requires a large frontal area on the vehicle, thereby producing a high associated drag.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 illustrates a traditional heat exchanger device on a typical commercial vehicle.
      <br/>
      Private and commercial vehicles usually employ a heat exchanger commonly referred to as a "radiator" to effect heat transfer.
      <br/>
      As illustrated, the radiator is traditionally placed substantially perpendicular to the free stream flow encountered by the vehicle as the vehicle travels forward.
      <br/>
      As a result, the vehicle experiences a substantial drag force.
      <br/>
      While the perpendicularly arranged radiator cools the vehicle engine effectively, the associated drag greatly affects the performance of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The result is a decrease in fuel efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      FIG. 2 depicts a typical Formula 1 or "Indy" racing car.
      <br/>
      On this type of vehicle, a heat exchange device, or radiator, is also traditionally placed substantially perpendicular to a free stream flow of air encountered by the vehicle when the vehicle travels in a forward direction.
      <br/>
      However, the heat exchanger is usually built into a side pod, rather than mounted on the front end as with the commercial vehicle.
      <br/>
      In this configuration, air is ducted from the free stream into the pod such that it passes through the heat exchanger and out through an exhaust port.
      <br/>
      Similar to the commercial vehicle of FIG. 1, there is a large amount of drag created by the heat exchange device.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, in neither the commercial application nor the racing application does the heat exchanger perform well at low vehicle speed, unless a mechanical device, such as a fan, is used to promote flow through the radiator.
      <br/>
      Fans, however, absorb and reduce engine power.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Thus, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the industry to address the aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention provides a system and method for supplying high density heat exchange to a vehicle at various speeds, including zero to low speeds.
      <br/>
      In structure, the high density heat exchanging system essentially comprises an aerodynamic member, a porous device, and a force augmentation device.
      <br/>
      The aerodynamic member is configured to generate aerodynamic forces when a free stream flow is encountered, and includes a high pressure surface, a low pressure surface, a leading edge and a trailing edge, where the leading edge and the trailing edge define a length therebetween.
      <br/>
      The aerodynamic member is arranged and configured on the vehicle to produce forces and loads on the vehicle generally desirable for improving traction and handling of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The porous device is disposed intermediate within the length of the aerodynamic member and provides heat exchange when fluid flows through the porous device.
      <br/>
      The porous device includes an inlet, configured to receive fluid flow and disposed in the high pressure surface of the aerodynamic member, and an outlet, configured to expel fluid flow and disposed in the low pressure surface of the aerodynamic member.
      <br/>
      In this configuration, the fluid flow passes from flowing adjacent the high pressure surface of the aerodynamic member to flowing adjacent the low pressure surface of the aerodynamic member through the porous device.
      <br/>
      The force augmentation device is disposed on the aerodynamic member.
      <br/>
      The force augmentation device can augment forces generated by the aerodynamic member or be configured to generate force independently, thereby encouraging fluid flow through the porous device when a free stream of flow is absent.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention can also be viewed as a method for producing high density heat exchange in a vehicle.
      <br/>
      The method can be broadly summarized by the following steps: providing an aerodynamic member on a vehicle and generating an aerodynamic force on that vehicle with the aerodynamic member.
      <br/>
      The method further comprises the steps of providing heat exchange with a porous device disposed within the aerodynamic member and augmenting the aerodynamic force with a device disposed on the aerodynamic member.
    </p>
    <p num="8">An advantage of the present invention is a system that provides an increased pressure differential across a porous device and radiator core for efficient heat transfer.</p>
    <p num="9">Another advantage of the present invention is a system that provides effective heat transfer for a vehicle, even at zero to low speed, while reducing the frontal area of the vehicle and aerodynamic drag upon the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="10">An additional advantage of the present invention is to provide a heat exchange device for racing cars that improves aerodynamic down force and reduces aerodynamic drag while providing high cooling rates without the use of moving parts, such as fans.</p>
    <p num="11">Another advantage of the present invention is that it provides a system of non-moving parts comprising a synergistic radiator/aerodynamic control surface in a single structure contributing to improved mechanical reliability of the system and reduced weight of the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="12">An additional advantage of the present invention is improved traction in turns for race cars, or in icy/snowy/rainy weather for commercial vehicles.</p>
    <p num="13">Another advantage is reduction of frontal area and radiator drag.</p>
    <p num="14">Yet another advantage of the present invention is an improvement in fuel economy for commercial vehicles due to the reduction in frontal area and radiator drag.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description.
      <br/>
      It is intended that all such additional features and advantages be included herein within the scope of the present invention.

    <p num="17">
      While the invention is susceptible to various modification and alternative forms, a specific embodiment thereof is shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail.
      <br/>
      It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the invention is to cover all modification, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate a first preferred embodiment of the high density heat exchanging system 30.
      <br/>
      While the system 30 is illustrated in FIG. 3 as applied to a racing car, it should be understood that the system 30 is not limited to racing applications or even to automobile applications, and could be applicable to virtually any mobile vehicle or thing.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, while the fluid flow is referred to herein primarily as air, it should be understood that the fluid flow is not limited to that of air.
      <br/>
      In the first preferred embodiment, the high density heat exchanging system 30 is mounted on, as for example, a vehicle 34, as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The system 30, preferably, provides heat exchange for a vehicle 34 engine whereby fluid coolant circulated adjacent heated engine parts is circulated through the radiator core for cooling.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In structure, the system 30 includes an aerodynamic member 32 with a porous device 36 disposed therein and, optionally, but preferably, a force augmentation device 39 disposed thereon.
      <br/>
      The porous device 36 can be further defined to include a radiator for providing heat exchange.
      <br/>
      The aerodynamic member 32 includes a high pressure surface 42, a low pressure surface 44, a leading edge 46, and a trailing edge 48.
      <br/>
      The porous device 36 is disposed within the aerodynamic member 32 between the leading edge 46 and the trailing edge 48 and includes an inlet 33, preferably disposed on the high pressure surface 42 of the aerodynamic member 32, and an outlet 35, disposed on the low pressure surface 44 of the aerodynamic member 32.
      <br/>
      A force augmentation device 39 is included on the aerodynamic member 32 in which the porous device 36 is embedded.
      <br/>
      In the first preferred embodiment the force augmentation device 39 comprises a mechanical flap 40 hingedly disposed on the aerodynamic member 32 towards the trailing edge 48 and is capable of various deflection positions.
      <br/>
      The deflection position of the mechanical flap 40 in relation to the aerodynamic member 32 can be altered, thereby ultimately altering the forces produced on the vehicle 34 by the system 30.
      <br/>
      A force augmentation device may also comprise a pneumatic control device.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Looking now at a method of use for the high density heat exchanging system 30, the aerodynamic member 32 can be provided on the front or rear of the vehicle; however, it is preferable that the aerodynamic member 32 is provided on a side of the vehicle 34 such as to generate a desired aerodynamic force on the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The force generally desired is a downward lift force L (shown in FIG. 3) to improve traction of the vehicle 34 when the vehicle encounters a free stream of flow V (shown in FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      However, it should be understood that the aerodynamic member 32 can be provided such as to produce other desired forces.
      <br/>
      As such, it is preferred that the aerodynamic member 32 is disposed on the vehicle 34 such that the high pressure surface 42 of the aerodynamic member 32 is facing upwardly and the low pressure surface 44 of the aerodynamic member 32 is facing downwardly.
      <br/>
      The aerodynamic member 32 is provided to a side of the vehicle and aligned substantially parallel to the prevailing wind, or free stream of flow encountered by the vehicle when the vehicle moves forwardly.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the aerodynamic member 32 is disposed at a negative angle A (shown in FIG. 3) to the predominant direction of motion D (shown in FIG. 3) of the vehicle 34, thereby allowing the aerodynamic member 32 to entrain a maximum amount of total pressure.
      <br/>
      The mechanical flap 40 of the first preferred embodiment acts to augment the aerodynamic forces by producing lift, or down force, as a result of the deflection position.
      <br/>
      The force generated by the force augmentation device 39 creates an increased pressure differential across the porous device 36, thereby increasing the flow of fluid adjacent the radiator core and providing effective heat exchange.
      <br/>
      The entrained fluid flows adjacent the aerodynamic member 32 and through the porous device 36, as illustrated by the arrows numbered 31, in FIG. 3, thereby providing heat exchange.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the lift, drag, and aerodynamic moments acting on the vehicle are varied by the aerodynamic member 32 and mechanical flap 40.
      <br/>
      As such, the present invention provides increased download and traction for the vehicle 34, as well as heat exchange.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In the case of racing cars, the side pod thickness and drag, of the conventional configurations, will be decreased by the new shape of the member fixed to the vehicle and because the radiator is no longer substantially perpendicular to the airflow.
      <br/>
      In the case of commercial vehicles, the frontal area will be reduced, thereby reducing drag.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the present invention operates on pressure differentials to provide heat exchange and therefore does not require a fan or other mechanical device to operate effectively, thereby cutting down on moving parts, reducing vehicle weight, and increasing mechanical reliability of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      FIG. 5 illustrates a second preferred embodiment of the high density heat exchanging system 30.
      <br/>
      The second preferred embodiment includes an aerodynamic member 32 and a porous device 36, as disclosed above, and a force augmentation device 39 comprising a pneumatic circulation control device 50 disposed towards the trailing edge 48 of the aerodynamic surface 32.
      <br/>
      The circulation control device 50 ejects air from a pressurized source 37, embedded in the aerodynamic member 32, and out a slot 38 disposed in the low pressure surface 44 and towards the trailing edge 48 of the aerodynamic member 32.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the trailing edge 48 is substantially rounded in cross-section in the second preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      The air is ejected from the slot 38 substantially tangentially to the adjacent portion of the low pressure surface 44 such that fluid flow is entrained about the rounded trailing edge 48 of the aerodynamic member 32.
      <br/>
      Pneumatic circulation control devices are known in the art and an example is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/503,185; inventor, Robert J. Englar; filed Jul. 17, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      The application of the pneumatic circulation control device 50 to the present invention allows mass flow through the heat exchanger in the absence of a free stream of flow, such as when the vehicle is nearly to completely stationary.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      FIG. 6 illustrates a third preferred embodiment of the high density heat exchanging system 30.
      <br/>
      The third preferred embodiment also includes an aerodynamic member 32 and a porous device 36, as disclosed above.
      <br/>
      The third preferred embodiment may also, optionally, include either of the force augmentation devices 39 disclosed in the first two embodiments, another heretofore undisclosed force augmentation device 39, or no force augmentation device at all.
      <br/>
      The third preferred embodiment further includes an appropriately placed forward-facing inlet sleeve 60.
      <br/>
      The inlet sleeve 60 is preferably adjustable and attached to the high pressure surface 42 of the aerodynamic member 32.
      <br/>
      The inlet sleeve 60 captures additional pressure from the free stream fluid flow and channels additional flow into the inlet 33 of the porous device 36, thereby channeling additional flow through the porous device 36.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that the aerodynamic member 32 also includes an outlet sleeve 62, although it should be understood that the system 30 may include only one of the inlet sleeve 60 or the outlet sleeve 62.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that the outlet sleeve 62 is aft-facing, and disposed on the low pressure surface 44 of the aerodynamic member 32 and adjacent the outlet 35 of the porous device 36.
      <br/>
      The outlet sleeve 62 acts to counteract lift loss due to the porosity of the porous device 36 and also increase the entrainment capability of a force augmentation device 39 along the trailing edge 48 of the aerodynamic member 32.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 illustrates the inlet sleeve 60 and the outlet sleeve 62 hingedly fixed the aerodynamic member 32.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 illustrates the inlet sleeve 60 and the outlet sleeve 62 slidably fixed to the aerodynamic member 32.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      It is further preferable that, as disposed on an aerodynamic member 32, the inlet sleeve 60 and the outlet sleeve 62 act as controllers receiving information input 65 to alter the position of the sleeves 60 and 62, to yield the desired amount of aerodynamic lift, down load, drag and moments, as well as the desired level of heat transfer across the porous device 36.
      <br/>
      The inlet sleeve 60 and the outlet sleeve 62 also allow compliance to the prevailing racing car regulations, which prohibit holes or porosity in these particular portions of the vehicle, and require the lower surface parallel to the road.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the use of the inlet sleeve 60 and the outlet sleeve 62 will prevent water or other spray from impacting the nearly-horizontal apparatus 30.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Many variations and modifications may be made to the above-described embodiment(s) of the invention without departing substantially from the spirit and principles of the invention.
      <br/>
      All such modifications and variations are intended to be included herein within the scope of the present invention.
