      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a copolymer suitable for a stretch film and a wrap film in particular, a process for producing said copolymer, and a molded article of said copolymer.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Arts</p>
    <p num="4">
      In general, an elastic recoverability, transparency and mechanical strength found in a polyvinyl chloride are required for a copolymer to be used as a stretch film, a shrink film or a wrap film.
      <br/>
      However, the polyvinyl chloride comes in question concerning environmental pollution because of the possibility of generation of harmful substances in incineration.
      <br/>
      Various kind of polymers are presently considered as a replacement for the polyvinyl chloride, but it is a status quo that none of them being satisfactory from the viewpoints of viscoelastic properties and transparency has been obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Since copolymerization of an  ALPHA -olefin represented by propylene with an alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon represented by styrene was carried out using a Solvay type titanium trichloride catalyst, studies using various solid catalysts have been carried out.
      <br/>
      For example, polymerization processes which use a solid catalyst using titanium tetrachloride and an electron donor are disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) Nos. 60-26011 and 4-318006.
      <br/>
      However, in both of those processes, the polymerization activity is low and a homopolymer is formed as a by-product.
      <br/>
      Further, the obtained copolymer has a low amount of copolymerized styrene and possesses some crystallinity, and is not adequate from the viewpoints of elastic recoverability, flexibility and transparency.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 8-269134 discloses a process for producing a copolymer of propylene with styrene which has syndiotactic propylene sequences using a so-called homogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalyst which uses a specific transition metal compound and an organoaluminum compound.
      <br/>
      However, the copolymer obtained by the process, has also a low styrene content and a crystallinity, and is insufficient from the viewpoints of elastic recoverability, flexibility and transparency.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      An object of the present invention is to provide a novel copolymer of an  ALPHA -olefin with an alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon having a transparency and excellent elastic recoverability and flexibility, and not containing a halogen which may be pointed out as a cause for environmental pollution.
      <br/>
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing said copolymer at high polymerization activity, and a molded article of said copolymer which is excellent in mechanical strength, flexibility and anti-scratch property, and further has a transparency and good elastic recoverability.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">The present invention is illustrated in detail below.</p>
    <p num="16">The copolymer of the present invention is a copolymer of an  ALPHA -olefin with an alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon wherein the copolymer has a structure in which tertiary carbon atoms are mutually separated by two successive methylene groups (in other words, an ethylene group)in the backbone of the copolymer.</p>
    <p num="17">
      As the  ALPHA -olefin in the present invention,  ALPHA -olefins having 3 to 20 carbon atoms are preferable, and specific examples of the  ALPHA -olefin include linear olefins such as propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene and the like, branched olefins such as 3-methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 5-methyl-1-hexene and the like, vinylcyclohexane and the like.
      <br/>
      More preferable  ALPHA -olefin is propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, or vinylcyclohexane, and in particular, propylene is preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As an alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon in the present invention, alkenyl compounds having an aromatic hydrocarbon group having 6 to 25 carbon atoms is preferable.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of the aromatic hydrocarbon group having 6 to 25 carbon atoms include a phenyl group, tolyl group, xylyl group, tert-butylphenyl group, vinylphenyl group, naphthyl group, phenanthryl group, anthrathenyl group and the like.
      <br/>
      A phenyl group, tolyl group, xylyl group, tert-butylphenyl group, vinylphenyl group or naphthyl group is preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Specific examples of such an alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon include alkylstyrenes such as p-methylstyrene, m-methylstyrene, o-methylstyrene, p-ethylstyrene, m-ethylstyrene, o-ethylstyrene, 2,4-dimethylstyrene, 2,5-dimethylstyrene, 3,4-dimethylstyrene, 3,5-dimethylstyrene, 3-methyl-5-ethylstyrene, p-tert-butylstyrene, p-sec-butylstyrene and the like; alkenylbenzenes such as styrene, 2-phenylpropylene, 2-phenylbutene and the like; bis(alkenyl)benzenes such as divinylbenzene and the like; vinylnaphthalenes such as 1-vinylnaphthalene and the like, etc.
      <br/>
      As the alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon used in the present invention, styrene, p-methylstyrene, m-methylstyrene, o-methylstyrene, p-tert-butylstyrene, 2-phenylpropylene, divinylbenzene or 1-vinylnaphthalene is preferable and styrene is preferable in particular.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The copolymer of the present invention is a copolymer of an  ALPHA -olefin with an alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon, and its copolymerization composition is preferably 0.1 to 55% by mole as a content of the alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon unit, more preferably 1 to 35% by mole and most preferably 6 to 30% by mole.
      <br/>
      The remainder is the  ALPHA -olefin unit.
      <br/>
      When the copolymerization composition is within the range, the copolymer is preferably excellent in flexibility, in particular.
      <br/>
      The copolymerization composition is easily determined by a 13 C-NMR spectrum using o-dichlorobenzene as a solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The copolymer of the present invention has a structure in which tertiary carbon atoms are mutually separated by two successive methylene groups (herein-after, referred to simply as "two methylene groups") in the backbone.
      <br/>
      When the  ALPHA -olefin or alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon unit is bonded to an inverse direction in the molecular chains of the copolymer, namely, when the insertion form of the  ALPHA -olefin or alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon takes 2,1-insertion successively after 1,2-insertion, tertiary carbon atoms are mutually separated by two methylene groups.
      <br/>
      The structure of such a copolymer is easily determined by a 13 C-NMR spectrum using o-dichlorobenzene as a solvent, and when tertiary carbon atoms are mutually separated by two methylene groups, signals corresponding to the methylene groups (S ALPHA  BETA ) are observed as a plural number of peaks at 30 to 38 ppm.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The copolymer having positions in which tertiary carbon atoms are mutually separated by two methylene groups in the backbone has a mitigated rigidity of the main chain and is excellent in elastic recoverability and flexibility.</p>
    <p num="23">The copolymer in the present invention may have a structure in which tertiary carbon atoms are mutually separated by one methylene group in the backbone and a structure in which tertiary carbon atoms are mutually separated by three or more methylene groups in the backbone.</p>
    <p num="24">For example, when a so-called head-to-tail bond by which two of the  ALPHA -olefin or alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon unit are sequentially bonded in a same direction occurres, tertiary carbon atoms are mutually separated by one methylene group (S ALPHA  ALPHA ).</p>
    <p num="25">In the copolymer of the present invention, the molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) represented by a ratio of weight average molecular weight (Mw) to number average molecular weight (Mn) is preferably 1.5 to 4.0 from the viewpoints of mechanical strength and transparency.</p>
    <p num="26">
      The copolymer of the present invention is preferably an amorphous copolymer substantially having no crystallinity, from the viewpoint of transparency.
      <br/>
      It can be confirmed by no substantial indication of a melting point in a DSC melting curve that the copolymer has substantially no crystallinity.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The copolymer of the present invention is preferably a copolymer substantially having no stereoregularity of the conformation of  ALPHA -olefins and alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbons in the skeleton of the copolymer, from the viewpoints of transparency, flexibility and elastic recoverability.
      <br/>
      It can be confirmed by observation of a multiplet of the methylene groups such as S ALPHA  BETA  or the like in the signal of 13 C-NMR spectrum that the copolymer has substantially no stereoregularity of the conformation.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Such copolymer of the present invention can be produced at high polymerization activity, for example, by copolymerizing the  ALPHA -olefin with the alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon in the presence of a catalyst comprising (A) and �(B) and/or (C)� described below:</p>
    <p num="29">(A): a transition metal complex represented by the following general formula �I�:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
