    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">

      <br/>
      The invention further relates to barium titanate thin films and plates incorporating a non-reactive electroconductive material, "M".
      <br/>
      The storage capacity of the thin films and plates of the invention is at least 1 farad/cm3.
      <br/>
      The invention further relates to a method of preparing the thin films.
      <br/>
      Such crystalline thin films are characterized by a perovskite structure and have utility in the manufacture of a wide variety of ferroelectric, dielectric, pyroelectric, piezoelectric and electro-optic devices, such as nonvolatile semiconductor memories, thin-film capacitors, pyroelectric (IR) detectors, sensors, surface acoustic wave substrates, optical waveguides, optical memories, spatial light modulators as well as frequency doublers for diode lasers.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In the past years, there has been extended efforts in the development of high capacitance electrochemical energy storage devices, especially capacitors and batteries, for use in reduced volumetric areas.
      <br/>
      Both capacitors and batteries store energy by the separation of positive and negative charges.
      <br/>
      The need to store greater amounts of energy in a smaller package continues to drive new research.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Barium titanate (BaTiO3) has been studied for use in such microelectronic applications.
      <br/>
      Such studies have included the different forms of barium titanate including powder, bulk, thin film and multilayer owing to their excellent electronic and optical characteristics including high dielectric constant, transparency in visible wavelength, and high non-linear optical susceptibility.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The use of barium titanates in electric vehicles is further highly desired.
      <br/>
      Presently, automotive internal combustion engines are increasingly being challenged by environmental concerns, favoring an increased role for electric vehicles.
      <br/>
      Thus, supercapacitors, as well as batteries, play a major role in this developing market.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Supercapacitors having capacitances in the range of milli-Farads to Farads have suffered from slow charging and discharging cycles in light of their high series resistance (i.e., large RC time constants).
      <br/>
      In addition, they often rely on corrosive and environmentally unfriendly electrolytes.
      <br/>
      For instance, the BaTiO3 thin films set forth in T. Hayashi, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., 32 4092 (1993) have a capacitance unacceptable for use in electric vehicles as well as other industries.
      <br/>
      Alternative nanosized capacitors are constantly being sought.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Need exists therefore for an electrical energy storage device that combines the desirable features of conventional capacitors yet can store much larger amounts of energy in a smaller package and can be manufactured at reasonable costs.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The invention relates to a nanostructured BaTiO3 thin film composite that has from 1,000 to 10,000 times the area and storage capacity of conventional BaTiO3 thin films, plates and arrays.
      <br/>
      The BaTiO 3 thin films and plates of the invention can also exhibit a variable discharge rate controlled by optical illumination (pumping).

    <p num="8">
      The barium titanates comprising the coating of the thin films or plates of the invention exhibit dielectric, ferroelectric and/or paraelectric properties.

      In another embodiment of the invention, the thin films comprise barium titanate incorporating a non-reactive electroconductive material, "M", capable of forming a microstructure with the thin film.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="13">
      The thin film composites of the invention comprise a thin layer, plate or array (collectively termed "thin film") of the formula Baa Tib Oc wherein a and b are independently between 0.75 and 1.25 and c is between about 2.5 and about 5.0 deposited onto a substrate.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, both a and b are 1 and c is about 3 of the formula Baa Tib Oc.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The thin film composites of the invention exhibit an extremely high energy density.
      <br/>
      As such, thin film composites of the invention have particular applicability in the production of microminiature capacitors.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In addition, the BaTiO3 thin film composites of the invention exhibit a variable discharge rate controlled optically.
      <br/>
      This permits the capacitance of an article composed of such composites to be tunable for applications where a specific capacitance is desired.
      <br/>
      In addition, this facilitates designing variable electric series resistance devices for controlled power delivery.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The substrate of the thin film composites of the invention typically are composed of silicon, fused silica, Pt-coated silicon, alumina, sapphire, Pt-coated sapphire, metallized foil, such as a copper foil, or a single crystal SrTiO3 substrate.
      <br/>
      In addition, the substrate may consist of any electroconductive metal having a melting point of at least 850 C. The substrate should not melt or undergo a phase transition under typical annealing conditions or react or diffuse with the other components of the composite (or laminate as described herein) so as to diminish the properties of the resultant product.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, Al would be unsuitable as it would melt at 850 (degree)  C., a typical annealing temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Suitable for use as the silicon layer are rapidly thermally processed silicon layers crystallized by a lamp based annealing system.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, silicon whose crystallization has been induced by a laser, such as an excimer laser, may also be used.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the substrate may comprise an oxide layer which is rapidly thermally processed using a lamp-based annealing system or laser annealing with a laser such as an excimer or carbon dioxide laser or electron-beam processing.
      <br/>
      Still further, the substrate of the invention offering increased surface areas may include anisotropically etched substrates as well as locally patterned substrates by laser ablation.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The thin film of the composite comprises an inorganic oxide of the formula Baa Tib Oc wherein a and b are independently between 0.75 and 1.25 and c is between about 2.5 and about 5 0 (slashed zero)  In preferred embodiment, a and b are approximately 1 and c is about 3 0 (slashed zero)  In a most preferred embodiment, the inorganic oxides exhibit a tetragonal or perovskite crystalline lattice.
      <br/>
      During the process described herein, oxygen vacancies and internal stress contribute to the crystallite growth and phase transformation of the oxide.
      <br/>
      For larger grain sizes of the barium titanate, the material tends to assume a tetragonal crystal structure.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The thin film may further contain a non-reactive component capable of inducing internal strain.
      <br/>
      Suitable for use as non-reactive components include europium, silicon nitride, boron nitride, magnesium oxide, alumina, tungsten carbide as well as diamond particles.
      <br/>
      While amounts as high as 50 volume percent of the non-reactive component may be employed, the preferred amount is less than 10 volume percent.
      <br/>
      Typically, the amount of non-reactive component is between from about 0.01 to about 1 volume percent of the thin film.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The thin film composites exhibit excellent dielectric properties, as evidenced by their energy storage capacity.
      <br/>
      The thin film composites may further exhibit excellent ferroelectric or paraelectric properties.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The thin film composites of the invention have particular applicability in the production of capacitors.
      <br/>
      A capacitor containing the thin film composites of the invention having an area approximating three stacked 25 cent pieces renders an equivalent energy density as that of a one quart juice which contains the thin film composites of the prior art.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Such capacitors may be two-dimensional (planar) or three-dimensional (having substrates characterized by trenches, depressions or macropores).
      <br/>
      The latter enhance the performance of the capacitors.
      <br/>
      These capacitors provide greater plate area and thus greater capacitance.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      FIG. 1 is a schematic design of a (planar style) capacitor made by the sol-gel process described below.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2-8 show alternative substrate surfaces having increased specific areas between from about 100 to about 10,000 times the surface area of the planar style capacitor of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 2 and 3, discrete macropores define the upper surface of the substrate.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 4 and 5, trenches are formed in the substrate.
      <br/>
      This greatly increases the surface area of the substrate surface.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The dielectric material of the invention is coated over the surface of the pores or depressions of the substrates.
      <br/>
      Especially desirable results are obtained where the substrate is composed of silicon.
      <br/>
      Pores or depressions are typically created in the substrate by anodic etching.
      <br/>
      For instance, where silicon is the substrate, the p+ (or n+) monocrystalline silicon substrate may be subjected to anodic etching.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate the substrate of the thin film composites of the invention wherein the substrate is characterized by depressions.
      <br/>
      Substrates of the planar capacitor may be formed from a n+ or p+ silicon substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Capacitors in accordance with the invention are those exemplified in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Such substrates may be formed from for example n+ silicon substrate or it may be formed from a polysilicon layer which lines the trench end in the n+ (or p+) silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      Upper plate and lower plate are electrically insulated with the dielectric layer.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      It is important not to fill the depressions, pores or trenches with the dielectric material since this creates high energy pockets and further may generate heat or raise the electric series resistance (ESR) of the capacitor.
      <br/>
      Rather, it is essential to conformly coat the depressions, pores or trenches.
    </p>
    <p num="28">The substrate may further be treated by methods defined in the art to exhibit projections which extend from its surface as set forth in FIG. 8.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Anodic etching is performed by submerging the silicon wafer or other substrate in a container of electrolytic solution of hydrofluoric acid and then subjecting the wafer to an electrolytic current.
      <br/>
      Such procedures are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,508,542, herein incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      Further, note the techniques set forth in V. Lehmann, W. Honlein, H. Reisinger, H. Wendt and J. Willer, Sol.
      <br/>
      State Technol., Nov., pp.99-102(1995) directed to macropore substrates, likewise incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      Further, as an alternative method, the surface enhancement may also be realized by producing substrate with textured surfaces and incorporating thin film dielectrics on said textured surfaces with an objective to increase the total surface area (by a factor greater than 1 where 1 corresponds to the planar surface) of the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Such substrates may further include lithographically patterned or anodically etched pores, naturally occurring structures such as those occurring in zeolites and aerogels, anisotropically etched substrates as well as laser ablated locally patterned substrates.</p>
    <p num="31">Methods suitable for conformly coating the structured substrates of the invention include procedures known in the art such as physical and/or reactive evaporation, radio-frequency or microwave or electron cyclotron resonance methods including sputtering, chemical vapor deposition including metallorganic chemical vapor deposition, hydride vapor phase deposition, liquid phase epitaxy and electro-epitaxy.</p>
    <p num="32">
      When produced by the methods recited herein, two-dimensional planar thin film composites have a capacitance generally up to 1.0, typically greater than 0.3, most typically between about 0.4 to about 0.5 farads/cm3.
      <br/>
      When produced by the methods described herein, thin film composites containing an increased specific area substrate surface have a capacitance generally up to 100, typically at least 1, more typically at least 50, most typically at least 100, farads per cubic centimeter.
      <br/>
      Since capacitance of the composites of the invention is increased exponentially when the area of the substrate is effectively enhanced as in the three-dimensional trench, depression or macroporous configuration, capacitance measurements greater than 1,000 farads/cm3 may be obtained.
      <br/>
      Capacitance measurements of the thin films in an enhanced area (of the three dimensional structure) have been calculated to be as high as 82.2 farad/cm3 in a 2,000 times enhanced area and an energy density in excess of 13,000 joules/cm3. (Capacitance measurements as recited herein are based on 6 to 10 nF (nanofarads) per 1.3 mm diameter * 110 (nanometers) nm thick test samples.)
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Crystallization and increased energy storage capacity of the composites is further enhanced by the presence of additive "M" in the thin film.
      <br/>
      Suitable as additive "M" are those non-reactive electroconductive materials which form a microstructure with the thin film.
      <br/>
      The resulting titanate may be represented by the formula Md Baa Tib Oc wherein d is about 0.01 to 0.25, a is about 0.75 to about 1.25, b is about 0.75 to about 1.25 and c is about 2.5 to about 5 0 (slashed zero)  X-ray diffraction of the material with "M" illustrates that a crystal structure which changes from predominantly cubic to tetragonal or perovskite and a crystallite size which increases with increasing concentration of "M" in the coating.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Preferred as "M" are gold, copper, intermetallic compounds such as Ni3 Al, Ru and InSn.
      <br/>
      Particles of "M" should be electroconductive up to the melting point of the substrate and should neither react or diffuse through the substrate.
      <br/>
      As such, the particles will not degrade the properties of the resulting product.
      <br/>
      Particles of "M" should preferably be chosen such that they will form a specific microstructure.
      <br/>
      Preferred results are obtained from particles characterized as accicular precipitates, feathered microstructures, dendritic precipitates or lamellar or eutectic-type structures.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, "M" is selected so as to cause internal strain in the film or plate that would promote crystallinity with desired crystal structure.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Enhancement of the capacitance with the "M" additive in barium titanate is likely caused by additional internal stress (compression) by particles of "M".
      <br/>
      Incorporation of particles of "M" further create strong local electric fields around the oxides which likely assists in electron transfer from the barium titanate matrix to the "M" particles.
      <br/>
      This in turn contributes to weakening of the bonds between the oxygen atoms and the cations in the barium titanates.
      <br/>
      At high temperatures during annealing, atomic migration is therefore facilitated.
      <br/>
      Thin films or plates containing the oxides with additives have optimal energy storage capacities.
      <br/>
      In fact, the range is at least 10 times higher when additions of "M" are employed.
      <br/>
      Particles of "M" further enhance the dielectric, paraelectric and/or ferroelectric characteristics of the oxides.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Representative of such oxides are those of the formula Md Baa Tib Oc wherein a and b are independently about 0.75 to about 1.25, c is about 2.5 to about 5.0 and d is about 0.01 to 0.25. A particularly preferred inorganic oxide is of the formula Md Baa Tib Oc wherein a and b are both 1, c is 3 and d is 0.01 to 0.25. Especially preferred are those inorganic oxides of the stated formula wherein M is Au.</p>
    <p num="37">
      In general, a deposited inorganic oxide film is only partially crystalline.
      <br/>
      Since the dielectric properties are enhanced by film crystallinity, a post deposition thermal treatment is often used.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished by rapid thermal annealing using quartz halogen lamps, laser-assisted annealing using for example an excimer or carbon dioxide laser, or using electron beam annealing.

    <p num="80">
      Barium titanate glycolate was prepared as follows.
      <br/>
      Six grams of barium oxide (99.5% purity) fine powder was added to 30 ml of ethylene glycol using vigorous stirring.
      <br/>
      The reaction was exothermic, and the reaction mixture was continuously stirred over 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was then dilute with 40 ml of 2--propanol.
      <br/>
      In addition, 9.0 ml of titanium isopropoxide was added with vigorous stirring.
      <br/>
      To avoid rapid precipitation the saturated ethylene glycol solution as kept hot (70 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The morphology of the nanocrystalline BaTiO3 film prepared is set forth in FIG. 11 after annealing at 650 (degree)  C. for 1 hour.
      <br/>
      The coated samples were then dried under vacuum at 90 (degree)  C. for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      They were then heated at a rate of 200 (degree)  C./hour under dry flowing air up to the temperatures required to initiate calcination of the films, i.e., between 600 and 900 (degree)  C. Elemental analysis using energy dispersive X-ray analysis on a scanning electron microscope showed that these films were BaTiO3 films.
      <br/>
      The spectra also showed the presence of elements from the glass substrate and Al contacts (Si, K, Na, and Al) and some impurities coming from the solution (Zn and Ca).
      <br/>
      Rapid thermal annealing of the films at 800 (degree)  C. can be used to improve the crystallinity of the films and to increase the dielectric constant from about 20 to about 80.
