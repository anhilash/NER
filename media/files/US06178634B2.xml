      A miniature recycle-type heat exchanger to produce recycle-type heat exchangers from high extensibility, high plasticity aluminum or copper billets (ingots) utilizing a pressure forming press to extrude lightweight, thin, and small form factor recycle-type heat exchangers.
      <br/>
      The production method includes annealing copper and aluminum billet (ingot) material, conveying the material to a vibrator for placement in an ordered arrangement, and then conveying and fixing the material onto molds in a pressure forming press for the extrusion tasks required to fabricate the heat exchanger bodies.
      <br/>
      In the final stage after shaping and determination of the fluid input direction, the bodies are placed in a vacuum sputtering machine to undergo a rough textured heat conductive microparticulate deposition process to complete the production of miniature recycle-type heat exchangers that are of very compact dimensions and lightweight, but have a large heat exchange capacity and, furthermore, a high heat transfer rate.

    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The invention herein relates to a miniature recycle-type heat exchanger production method that provides for the production of miniature recycle-type heat exchangers that transfer accumulated heat from a thermally conductive microparticulate medium to a fluid to achieve heat exchange.
      <br/>
      Suitable for processing at normal temperature, the finished product has the characteristics of difficult oxidation and high purity.
      <br/>
      The production method utilizes punching and extrusion techniques to fabricate a product having high density and exceptional mechanical strength.
      <br/>
      The base is vertical with the direction OF punching and extrusion process, and the finished product has three-way heat transfer capability.
      <br/>
      In the production method, an ultra thin base of 0.2 mm or more and having a plurality of holes are pressure formed in a single operation.
      <br/>
      The interior surfaces of the product are coated with an excellent heat conduction microparticulate coating that has a very high heat absorption characteristic and, at the same time, can be continuously produced under normal temperature conditions at high output volume and low production cost.
      <br/>
      Based on the principles of heat transfer enhancement, the product has a greater capacity to transfer heat from surface areas and is advantageous in applications involving extremely thin structures of reduced dimension and weight that require high efficiency heat transfer performance, such as computers, electronics, telecommunications, monitors, and other devices for which a miniature recycle-type heat exchanger production method is suitable.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Conventional heat exchangers installed in notebook computers now include extruded aluminum heat exchangers, cast aluminum heat exchangers, and miniature copper tube heat exchangers.
      <br/>
      As indicated in Table 1, the miniature copper tube heat exchanger has the best heat transfer capability, with a heat transfer coefficient of nearly 10 w/m2  (degree)  C. However, the shortcoming of the said copper tube heat exchanger is that hard welding under very low vacuum conditions is required during the production process, which oxidizes the surface of the finished product and increases manufacturing cost.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the copper tube heat exchanger tends to radiate large amounts of heat that is readily transferred to the host device, where components are subjected to damaging high temperatures.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the copper tube heat exchanger cannot be utilized for three-way heat transfer applications.
      <br/>
      Having observed such actual situations, the two inventors of the present invention, experienced in the manufacturing aluminum capacitor shells for many years, became aware of that the pressure forming press utilized to extrude aluminum billet into capacitor shells and other similar housings (such as easy-open drink containers) could also be utilized under normal temperature production conditions to fabricate complex shaped products in a single extrusion operation and after fabrication, would be capable of withstanding greater stress due to the resulting increased mechanical strength and also requiring less raw material.
      <br/>
      Since an ultra thin product having at least a thickness of 0.2 mm can be formed in a single operation, mass production at a fast rate was among the advantages obtained.
      <br/>
      As a result, research was conducted on a heat transfer invention involving large surface areas with the objective of compelling the entry direction of the air into the product (during convection) and that of higher heat transfer rates as well as the forming of complex shapes in a single punching and extrusion operation to reduce production costs, with accumulated heat to be transferred from a heat conductive microparticulate coating and dissipated in a low temperature fluid to achieve heat exchange.
      <br/>
      The research culminated in the miniature recycle-type heat exchanger production method of the invention herein.

      <br/>
      1.
      <br/>
      Pure copper and aluminum billets, which are non-ferrous materials, are conveyed to the annealing furnace and undergo an annealing procedure at a temperature of 300 degrees for one hour.
      <br/>
      2. Following completion of the annealing procedure, the copper and aluminum billets are conveyed into the vibrator and physically arranged in preparation for the next stage at rate of 50 to 100 pieces per minute and then conveyed one billet at a time to the pressure forming press molds.
      <br/>
      3. The conveyed copper and aluminum billets are placed in the molds of the pressure forming press, fixed into position by the molds, and then extruded into the bodies 10a, 10b and 10c of the miniature recycle-type heat exchangers 1a, 1b and 1c, respectively, with each of the said bodies having numerous columnar depressions 11 in a closely configured pattern of rows (as indicated in FIG. 2, FIG. 5 and FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      4. The miniature recycle-type heat exchanger bodies 10a, 10b and 10c are then conveyed to the drill press, where a series of fluid input holes 12 that govern fluid entry direction are respectively drilled into one side or more of the miniature recycle-type heat exchanger bodies 10a, 10b and 10c �as indicated in FIG. 2, FIG. 5 and FIG. 8, but also shown in FIG. 3, FIG. 4, FIG. 6, FIG. 7 and FIG. 10�.
