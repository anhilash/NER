    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>

    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Heretofore some kinds of 4-aryl-4-halopyrazolidine-3,5-dione derivatives have been known.
      <br/>
      For example, An.
      <br/>
      Quim. vol. 71, 396 to 399 (1975) discloses that compounds A, B and C to be described later, i.e. 4-aryl-4-halopyrazolidine-3,5-dione derivatives, can be prepared by Diels-Alder reaction between 4-chloro-4-phenylpyrazoline-3,5-dione and diene.
      <br/>
      Further An. Quim. vol. 75, 931 to 935 (1979) describes the under-mentioned compounds D and E as an intermediate for preparing 13,14-azasteroid, the compounds being prepared by Diels-Alder reaction between 4-chloro-4-phenylpyrazoline-3,5-dione and diene.
      <br/>
      In addition, Comment., Pontif. Acad. Sci. vol.2, 8 (1975) sets forth that compounds A, B and C to be described later can be prepared by chlorination of the corresponding 4-phenylpyrazolidine-3,5-dione derivative.
    </p>
    <p num="4">However, the compounds of the invention represented by the formula (1) are novel compounds which are not included in conventional compounds.</p>
    <p num="5">On the other hand, 4-aryl-4-nitropyrazolidine-3,5-dione derivatives are entirely novel compounds.  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="6">
      With insecticides and miticides in use for many years, pest insects have acquired resistance in recent years and become difficult to control with conventional insecticides.
      <br/>
      Accordingly it is expected to develop novel insecticides.
      <br/>
      Also in the herbicide field, the development of novel herbicides are expected.

    <p num="7">An object of the present invention is to provide 4-aryl-4-substituted pyrazolidine-3,5-dione derivatives which have not only extremely high insecticidal and miticidal activities but a high herbicidal activity.</p>

      An insecticidal formulation (200 ppm) was prepared by adding an aqueous solution (100 ppm) of Sorpol 355 (product of Toho Kagaku Co., Ltd.) to a methanol solution of a compound of the invention.
      <br/>
      Subsequently the formulation (2.0 ml) was sprayed over the leaves, and was air-dried.
      <br/>
      The leaves were left to stand in the thermostatic chamber (25 +- 2 (degree)  C., humidity 50%) for 2 days.
      <br/>
      Then a mortality of Tetranychus uricae was checked.

      A specified amount of the compound of the invention was dissolved in a small amount of acetone.

      Then the solution was diluted with an aqueous solution of Tween 80 to give a herbicidal formulation (2000 ppm).
      <br/>
      Pots (square, 5 cm in each side) were filled with paddy soil and a suitable quantity of seeds of chickweed, Aeschynomene indica, Echinochloa Crus-galli and Digitaria adscendens were sown in the pots.
      <br/>
      The pots were then covered with a thin layer of soil.
      <br/>
      In the soil treatment, the herbicidal formulation was uniformly applied dropwise over the soil surface immediately after sowing the seeds.
      <br/>
      In the stem- and leaf-treatment, the herbicidal formulation was sprayed over the soil after 8-day growth of the plants at room temperature of 23 (degree)  C. in a 16-hour lighting chamber.
      <br/>
      The herbicidal formulation was applied in an amount of 4 kg/ha calculated as the active component and was used in an amount of 0.5 ml both in the soil treatment and in the stem- and leaf-treatment.
