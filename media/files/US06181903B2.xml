      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a developing roller cleaning apparatus for a liquid printer, and more particularly, to a developing roller cleaning apparatus for a liquid printer adopting a blade thus increasing the efficiency of cleaning.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A liquid electrophotographic printer such as a liquid laser printer is known as a liquid printer.
      <br/>
      The liquid electrophotographic printer forms an electrostatic latent image by scanning a laser beam onto a photoreceptor medium, develops the image with developer including toner of a predetermined color using a development unit, and transfers the developed image to a print paper to print the image.
    </p>
    <p num="5">The liquid electrophotographic printer, as shown in FIG. 1, includes a laser scanning unit (LSU) for forming an electrostatic latent image on a photoreceptor web 10 and a developing unit 20 for developing an image corresponding to the electrostatic latent image.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The developing unit 20 includes a development reservoir 21, a developing roller 23 disposed to maintain a predetermined development gap G between itself and the photoreceptor web 10, a developing roller cleaning unit 30 for removing developer adhering to the developing roller 23.
      <br/>
      An injection unit 25 for injecting the developer including toner and carrier toward the development gap G, a squeegee roller 27 for separating the toner from the carrier by pressing the photoreceptor web 10, and a blade 29 for cleaning the developer adhering to the squeegee roller 27 where a drip line (DL) is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The developing roller cleaning apparatus 30 includes a pipe 31 having a hole formed therein and an injection hole 31 a and a cleaning roller 33 inserted around the pipe 31 for contacting and cleaning the developing roller 23.
      <br/>
      The cleaning roller 33 contacting the developing roller 23 cleans the developing roller 23 by means of developer injected through the injection hole 31 a of the pipe 31.
    </p>
    <p num="8">However, as the conventional developing roller cleaning apparatus having the above structure is not provided with a means to remove foreign materials adhering to the developing roller 23 after cleaning, the efficiency of cleaning is lowered so that the quality of printing is deteriorated.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">To solve the above problems considering the above conditions, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a developing roller cleaning apparatus for a liquid printer capable of improving the efficiency of cleaning and preventing fixation and damage to the developing roller by adopting a blade and setting the position and installation angle of the blade.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Accordingly, to achieve the above objective, there is provided a developing roller cleaning apparatus for a liquid printer which comprises a cleaning brush rotating in contact with a developing roller so that developer adhering to an outer circumferential surface of the developing roller can be cleaned; a blade holder, and a blade installed to be bent as the blade contacts the developing roller for removing foreign material back-plated on the developing roller after being cleaned by the cleaning brush, one end of the blade being coupled to the blade holder and the other end thereof contacting the outer circumferential surface of the developing roller.
      <br/>
      The blade has a blade interference  DELTA =(R--r), a blade leading edge pressure P, and a cleaning angle  THETA 2 satisfying the below conditions of 1.0 mm.ltorsim.
      <br/>

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="11">
      The above objective and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent by describing in detail a preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the attached drawings in which:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a view showing a conventional developing roller cleaning apparatus for a liquid printer;
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a side view showing a developing roller cleaning apparatus for a liquid printer according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention; and
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 is a view showing the arrangement of the developing roller cleaning apparatus for a liquid printer according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, a developing roller cleaning apparatus according to the present invention includes the cleaning brush 51 rotating in contact with the developing roller 40 and partially submerged into developer D during cleaning for cleaning developer adhering to an outer circumferential surface of the developing roller 40, a blade holder 55, and the blade 53 for removing foreign materials back-plated to the developing roller 40 after being cleaned by the cleaning brush 51 while one end thereof is fixedly coupled to the blade holder 55 and the other end contacting the outer circumferential surface of the developing roller 40.</p>
    <p num="13">In the developing roller cleaning apparatus having the above structure, the blade 53 should meet the following conditions.</p>
    <p num="14">First, all developer which is back-plated on the developing roller after development should be cleaned.</p>
    <p num="15">Second, the blade should not damage the surface of the developing roller.</p>
    <p num="16">Third, ink should not be fixed to the surface of the blade after cleaning.</p>
    <p num="17">Fourth, the rotation speed of the developing roller should not be affected by the pressure applied by the blade.</p>
    <p num="18">
      The blade 53 is made of urethane and the leading edge 53a contacts the outer circumferential surface of the developing roller 40.
      <br/>
      The blade 53 is installed to be slanted a predetermined angle with respect to the tangent line of the developing roller 40 in a counter-trail direction, that is, a direction opposite the rotation direction of the developing roller 40.
      <br/>
      Here, the blade 53 does not bend in a trail direction due to the rigidity and material characteristic thereof.
      <br/>
      Thus, a holding volume phenomenon of the developer D does not occur.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The blade 53 is preferably disposed to be bent as it contacts the developing roller 40 such that the pressure applied to the outer circumferential surface of the developing roller 40 can increase due to an elastic bias.
      <br/>
      The degree of bending can be represented by blade interference amount  DELTA .
      <br/>
      Here,  DELTA =R--r in which R denotes the radius of the developing roller 40 and r denotes the distance between the center of the developing roller 40 and the leading edge 53a of the blade 53 assuming that the elastic bias applied to the blade 53 installed to be bent is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Also, the capability of cleaning can be optimized by setting the pressure P�g/cm� of the leading edge 53a, the thickness t�mm� of the blade 53, the free length L�cm� of the blade 53, and the blade cleaning angle  THETA 2 �deg�, within a predetermined scope.</p>
    <p num="21">The pressure P of the leading edge 53a is pressure applied to the developing roller 40 at the leading edge 53a, that is, at a cleaning area, which can be represented in Equation 1.  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="22">
      Here,  DELTA max denotes the maximum deformation amount of the blade 53 and E denotes the elastic rate �g/cm3 � of tension.
      <br/>
      The free length L of the blade 53 is the length from the end portion of the blade holder 55 to the leading edge 53a.
      <br/>
      Also,  THETA 3 denotes the sagging angle of the blade 53 and satisfies Equation 2.  (Equation image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The blade deformation angle  THETA 1 is the angle between a definite straight line perpendicular to the definite straight line OP1 and the X axis.
      <br/>
      Here, the point P1 is a point where the blade 53 and the developing roller 40 contact each other and the point O is the center of the developing roller 40.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The blade cleaning angle  THETA 2 is the angle obtained by subtracting the blade sagging angle  THETA 3 from the blade deformation angle  THETA 1.</p>

      In consideration of the above results, when the cleaning leading edge pressure P is under 10 g/cm, the efficiency of cleaning is lowered.
      <br/>
      When the P is over 29 g/cm, the surface of the developing roller is scratched and there is high possibility of a phenomenon in which reverse bending of the blade in the other direction occurs.

      When the blade cleaning angle  THETA 2 is equal to or less than 5 (degree) , the efficiency of cleaning is lowered.

      When the blade cleaning angle  THETA 2 is equal to or greater than 20 (degree) , a frictional force between the developing roller 40 and the blade 53 increases so that a driving load increases and abnormal noise is generated.

      As described above, in the developing roller cleaning apparatus according to the present invention, urethane is selected as the material for the blade to be suitable for cleaning conditions and the blade interference and the blade pressure angle conditions are restricted, so that the developer back-plated on the developing roller can be cleaned without damaging the surface of the developing roller.
      <br/>
      Also, ink is not fixed on the blade after cleaning and the rotational speed of the developing roller is barely affected by the pressure applied by the blade.
