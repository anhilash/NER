      The present invention is related to electronic circuits for amplifying electrical signals.

      Amplification circuitry can be loosely divided into two types: high bandwidth and low power amplification circuitry.
      <br/>
      In the creation of high bandwidth and low power amplification circuitry, designers have different goals in mind and thus concern themselves with different issues when designing the different types of circuitry.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      For example, in the design of high bandwidth circuitry, designers are concerned with achieving high frequency and low distortion.
      <br/>
      However, most high bandwidth circuitry applications are not concerned with power efficiency issues.
      <br/>
      Thus, maintaining a low quiescent current or operating with a low supply voltage generally are not design constraints in high bandwidth circuitry.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the design of low power circuitry, on the other hand, designers are concerned about proper operation with a low supply voltage and low supply current.
      <br/>
      However, most low power circuitry applications are not beset with frequency or distortion issues.
      <br/>
      Thus, maintaining a high frequency or low distortion generally are not design constraints in low power circuitry.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Prior Art FIG. 1 is an example of a conventional rail-to-rail output stage 10 that is a low bandwidth, low voltage circuit.
      <br/>
      The conventional rail-to-rail output stage 10 includes a common source output transistor 12, a current mirror 14, and a current source 20.
      <br/>
      The current mirror 14 is formed having a pair of transistors 16 and 18.
      <br/>
      The current source 20 drives the current mirror 14 with a bias current Ib, which determines the quiescent current Iq in output transistor 12.
      <br/>
      Gate drive, which is provided by a preceding stage through an input 22, is amplified at output 24 by the gain of output transistor 12.
      <br/>
      However, load transistor 18 provides no symmetrical drive for sourcing output current.
      <br/>
      Consequently, output stage 10 creates significant distortion while providing a maximum output voltage swing.
      <br/>
      However, this is usually not a drawback since low supply voltage, low bandwidth designs are usually not required to have low distortion.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Prior Art FIG. 2 is an example of a conventional class AB complementary source follower output stage 30 that is a high bandwidth circuit.
      <br/>
      The class AB output stage 30 includes first and second output transistors 32 and 34 connected in series as source followers with respect to nodes A and B, respectively.
      <br/>
      A bias circuit 31 for output transistors 32 and 34 includes diode-connected transistors 40 and 42, and first and second current sources 36 and 38.
      <br/>
      Circuit input 44 is formed by the current programming input of current source 38.
      <br/>
      Although the class AB complementary output stage 30 is beneficial when a wide bandwidth, low distortion circuit having high output current is required, it does not allow the output voltage to swing close to either supply.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In both high bandwidth and low power amplification circuitry, designers use numerous techniques to accomplish various design goals.
      <br/>
      One such technique often used for increasing output current in a low quiescent current circuit has been the use of a Darlington transistor configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Prior Art FIG. 3 illustrates a Darlington emitter-follower circuit 50.
      <br/>
      The Darlington circuit 50 introduces a second npn transistor 52 having a base 54 connected in series with the emitter 56 of the first npn transistor 58.
      <br/>
      In contrast to the basic output stage 10 of FIG. 1, in FIG. 3 the emitter 56 of the first npn transistor 58 drives the second npn transistor 52 which in turn supplies the output current Iout, To do so, the second npn transistor 52 draws a base current IE2 from the emitter 56 of the first npn transistor 58.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      This configuration allows additional amplification of a base current such as IB2.
      <br/>
      For example, although IE2 is limited to  BETA 1 *IB2, the emitter current IE2 is amplified by the second emitter-follower transistor 52 to generate the output current Iout.
      <br/>
      Thus, assuming the first and second npn transistors 58 and 52 have current gains of  BETA 1 and  BETA 2, respectively, the maximum value of Iout = BETA 1 * BETA 2 *IB2.
      <br/>
      Hence the potential available output current Iout is greatly increased without increasing the quiescent current of Is.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      However, the additional amplification stage embodied in the second npn transistor 52 introduces its own problems.
      <br/>
      For example, an additional VBE voltage drop is introduced across the base 54 and the emitter 60 of the second npn transistor 52.
      <br/>
      As a result, the maximum output voltage reduces to VOUT =V+ -VSAT -2*VBE.
      <br/>
      The added VBE reduction of VOUT imposes a significant limitation to Darlington circuits 50, especially those running from lower-voltage power sources.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In summary, a variety of circuits exist for normal high bandwidth and low power circuitry.
      <br/>
      High bandwidth and low power circuitry applications normally have different requirements.
      <br/>
      However, there has been very little development in circuitry that has the requirements of both a high bandwidth circuit and a low power circuit.
      <br/>
      An application requiring portability would be one example where both types of requirements would need to be met to create a superior product.
      <br/>
      Since portable applications run on batteries, it would be very advantageous to use a circuit that requires a minimum number of battery cells and increases cell life by requiring a low supply current.
      <br/>
      A high speed amplifier that requires a low supply voltage would have the normal requirements of high speed circuitry, specifically high frequency and low distortion.
      <br/>
      It would also need, however, to operate on a minimum supply voltage and current.

    <p num="14">What is needed and desirable is a circuit that allows high frequency with low distortion, but can operate with a low supply voltage and low quiescent current.</p>

    <heading>BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">
      Although the Darlington output stage allows greater output current when low quiescent supply current is required, problems will arise when the Darlington configuration is used in a low voltage, high speed circuit that requires low distortion.
      <br/>
      The present invention addresses these problems by using dual signal paths to drive complementary push-pull output stages.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 4 shows a block diagram of an amplifier 100 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The amplifier 100 includes a dual input stage 110 including input stages 101 and 102, and a complementary push-pull output stage 112 having two push-pull output stages 104 and 106 connected at their outputs.
      <br/>
      Each input stage 101 and 102 has a differential input voltage VIN+ and VIN-. Each stage also has a single-ended output used to drive a common-emitter push-pull transistor configuration in the dual push-pull output stage 112.
      <br/>
      Two substantially symmetrical signal paths are formed from the common differential input to the common single output.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The use of two symmetrical signal paths as shown in FIG. 4 decreases even-order harmonic distortion.
      <br/>
      The signals that are above mid supply and below mid supply are amplified through a similar configuration, thus decreasing the even-order harmonics.
      <br/>
      The second harmonic in particular is very low in the circuit topology of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      However it should be noted that all even order harmonics are decreased by the use of the symmetrical signal paths.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      FIG. 5 shows a schematic illustration of an amplifier 200 having a complementary common-emitter push-pull output configuration in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The amplifier 200 includes a first input stage 101, a second input stage 102, a first push-pull output stage 104, and a second push-pull output stage 106.
      <br/>
      The first input stage 101 includes a differential transistor pair 203 and 204, and a folded cascode mirror arrangement having transistors 218, 219, 220 and diode 243.
      <br/>
      The second input stage 102 includes a differential transistor pair 201 and 202, and a folded cascode and mirror arrangement having transistors 210, 211, 215 and diode 244.
      <br/>
      The first push-pull output stage 104 includes transistors 248 and 252, and the second push-pull output stage 106 includes transistors 250 and 256.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The amplifier 200 of FIG. 5 operates as follows.
      <br/>
      The two symmetrical input stages 101 and 102 are used to drive the complementary push-pull output stages 104 and 106.
      <br/>
      The first path 101 uses transistors 203 and 204 as a differential pair to drive a first folded cascode mirror arrangement of transistors 218 and 219.
      <br/>
      The output of the first folded cascode and mirror arrangement is a current that flows into the collector of transistor 220.
      <br/>
      This current flows out of the base of transistor 248, the input transistor of the first npn push-pull output stage 104.
      <br/>
      Transistor 252 is the second transistor of the first npn push-pull output stage 104.
      <br/>
      Note that the common-emitter Darlington output stage inverts the output voltage relative to its input signal voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The second path 102 uses transistors 201 and 202 as a differential pair to drive the emitters of common-base transistors 210 and 211.
      <br/>
      However this time the npn folded cascode output drives a pnp mirror, instead of an npn mirror as the first path.
      <br/>
      The output of the second folded cascode is a current that flows into the collector of transistor 215.
      <br/>
      This current flows out of the base of transistor 250, the input transistor of the second pnp push-pull output stage 106.
      <br/>
      Transistor 256 is the second transistor of the second pnp push-pull output stage 106.
      <br/>
      A signal voltage inversion occurs in this common-emitter stage as well.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Under certain circumstances, the quiescent bias current in the two signal paths is uncertain.
      <br/>
      The present invention addresses this issue by biasing the two Darlington output stages so that the current is substantially the same in both paths when no output current is required.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 6 shows a block diagram of an amplifier 300 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The amplifier 300 of FIG. 6 is different from the amplifier 100 of FIG. 4 in that the amplifier 300 of FIG. 6 includes a bias arrangement 108.
      <br/>
      The amplifier 300 uses the bias arrangement 108 or 108a to bias the single-ended outputs of complementary input stages 101 and 102.
      <br/>
      The complementary input stages 101 and 102 in turn deliver the input currents I+ and I- of the complementary push-pull output stages 104 and 106.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      FIG. 7a shows a schematic illustration of an amplifier 400 having a complementary push-pull output configuration in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, including the bias arrangement 108 discussed above.
      <br/>
      The bias arrangement 108 includes transistors 221, 222, 223, and 224.
      <br/>
      The base of transistor 222 is biased 2 VBE down from the top rail in order to bias the 2 VBE base voltage of the pnp push-pull output stage.
      <br/>
      The base of transistor 223 is biased 2 PHI  up from the negative supply in order to bias the 2 VBE base voltage of the npn push-pull.
      <br/>
      In order to avoid saturation of transistors 221 and 224 as the power supply voltage is lowered, the collector of transistor 223 is connected to the cathode of Schottky diode 243, and the collector of transistor 222 is connected to the anode of Schottky diode 244.
      <br/>
      This forward biases the collector base of transistors 222 and 223 by a Schottky diode drop, typically about 0.3V. The minimum VCC supply voltage VCC (min.)=3VBE +VE +VSATCE -VD.
      <br/>
      Essentially this arrangement allows the circuit to operate with a supply voltage that is 3/10 of a volt lower than connecting the collectors of 221 and 224 to their respective bases.
      <br/>
      This is 10% of a 3V supply.
      <br/>
      Thus, if a user had another part with a 3V supply and a 10% tolerance, a circuit made according to the present invention could be assured to work with it.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIG. 7b shows a schematic illustration of an amplifier 401 having a complementary push-pull output configuration in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, including the bias arrangement 108a.
      <br/>
      The bias arrangement 108a includes transistors 221a, 222a, 223a, 224a; Schottky diodes 243a, and 244a.
      <br/>
      The base of transistor 222a is biased 2VBE -VD down from VCC in order to bias the 2VBE base of the pnp push-pull output stage since the emitter of 221a is level shifted up VD volts by diode 244a.
      <br/>
      In a similar way, transistor 223a is biased 2VBE -VD up from the negative supply in order to bias the 2VBE base voltage of the npn push-pull since the emitter of 224a is level shifted down VD volts by Schottky diode 243a.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, the minimum VCC supply voltage VCC (min.)=3VBE +VSATCE -VD.
      <br/>
      This allows the circuit to operate with a supply voltage that is less than VCC (min.) for bias circuit 108 by VE volts which is the degeneration voltage.
      <br/>
      This may be enough to allow for a 2.5V minimum supply voltage instead of 2.7V minimum supply voltage using bias circuit 108.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      It is desirable to have an amplification circuit where a current requirement at the output does not load the input stage of the amplifier.
      <br/>
      Although relatively robust, even with a Darlington arrangement loading effects exist; that is when a smaller value load resistance is placed from the output to ground, the open loop gain of the amplifier is reduced because of the loading effect reflected back into the circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The present invention addresses the load problem by introducing positive feedback.
      <br/>
      There are two critical things that are necessary to make the positive feedback work.
      <br/>
      One is that the correct node must be chosen to connect the feedback current so that positive rather than negative feedback is achieved.
      <br/>
      The second is that the positive feedback gain must be less than unity.
      <br/>
      If the feedback gain is greater than unity the circuit will oscillate.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 7a and 7b illustrate the use of positive feedback in amplifier 400 and 401 according to one embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In addition to the bias arrangement 108 and 108a discussed above with reference to FIG. 5, amplifiers 400 and 401 also include positive feedback transistors 254 and 255.
      <br/>
      The present invention senses the current that is required by the push-pull output stages.
      <br/>
      Transistors 254 and 255 sample the collector current of the push-pull input transistors 248 and 250, then feed back to the appropriate point of the input stage in such a way that positive feedback is achieved.
      <br/>
      The positive feedback works such that as the output is loaded, current that opposes that loading is injected back into the input stage.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The embodiment of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 7a without bias 114 was designed to operate on a current of about 1.6 mA. However, if the operating current is dropped to about 600  MU A the circuits illustrated in FIG. 7a will have problems with settling time.
      <br/>
      At that operating current, if the output voltage VOUT is swung to either one rail or the other, the opposite transistor will turn off causing a long settling time in the output signal.
      <br/>
      For example, if the output is pulled high the pnp output transistor 256 will be turned on.
      <br/>
      However, transistor 252 will turn off completely.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the output signal gets to its final destination, it will take a long time to settle because transistor 252 will have to come back on a small amount.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The present invention addresses this issue by adding a second bias 114 to the output transistors of the complementary push-pull output configuration thereby allowing the circuit to operate on a current of about 600  MU A. Transistors 258 and 260 may be biased off the same 2 PHI  node that is used to bias the base of transistors 223 and 222 in bias circuit 108 of FIG. 7a. Transistors 258 and 260 prevent the opposite push-pull output transistor from turning off completely, and set the minimum quiescent current for those devices.
      <br/>
      For the circuit shown in FIG. 7a the amount of minimum current depends on the area ratio between transistors 258 and 248, and transistors 260 and 250, as shown in the following equations:
      <br/>
      ICmin (Transistor256)=�ICnom (Transistor256)� * �A(Transistor260)/A(Transistor250)�
      <br/>
      ICmin (Transistor252)=�ICnom (Transistor252)� * �A(Transistor258)/A(Transistor248)�
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      This in turn addresses the settling problem when operating at a total circuit quiescent current of about 600  MU A. Transistors 258 and 260 also boost the impedence at the base of transistors 248 and 250 by supplying base current to 252 and 256.
      <br/>
      This reduces the signal current required from 248 and 250 so that there is even less loading effect at the output than the circuit of FIG. 7a without second bias 114.
      <br/>
      This enables the open loop gain to be as high for the 600  MU A version with bias 114 as in the 1.6 mA version without bias 114.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      While many of the described embodiments are referred to as output stages, this is a term of the art and is not intended to be limiting.
      <br/>
