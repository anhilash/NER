      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to golf.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a set of iron-type golf clubs.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art and Summary of the Invention</p>
    <p num="5">
      A typical set of golf clubs includes a set of wood-type clubs for hitting the ball off the tee and for long shots, a set of iron-type clubs for long, medium, and short shots, and a putter to roll the ball on the green.
      <br/>
      Of all the clubs in a set, the iron-type clubs, or "irons," typically encounter the most variations in shot distances and the most variations in ground, obstacle and lie conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The irons are numbered with designations from 1 through 9 and with individual wedge designations.
      <br/>
      For example, the iron which could essentially be designated number 10 is designated PW (pitching wedge).
      <br/>
      Additional wedges are often provided to provide even greater loft to the ball than a pitching wedge.
      <br/>
      Within a set, the higher the number designation, the greater the loft of the club.
      <br/>
      The lower numbered or long irons hit the ball the longest distance and are the most difficult to play, as it is relatively hard for the average golfer to get the ball airborne with the long irons.
      <br/>
      Golf club manufacturers thus try to design long irons that are easier to hit and more forgiving of off-centered shots.
      <br/>
      The medium numbered irons hit the ball a medium distance.
      <br/>
      The medium irons are typically designed to be both easy to hit and accurate.
      <br/>
      The shortest irons hit the ball the shortest distance and are used to land the ball closer to the target.
      <br/>
      As the location where the ball lands on the green is critical, more controllability and precision over the ball is required for the short irons.
      <br/>
      For the average golfer it is much easier to get the ball airborne with the short irons than with the long irons.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Unlike woods and putters, golfers typically purchase the irons as a correlated set which includes a large range of clubs.
      <br/>
      The clubs in such a set are designed to work together to reliably provide a golfer with predictable and progressive increments in shot distance from the lower numbered clubs to the higher numbered clubs.
      <br/>
      For example, a certain golfer may hit the ball 150 yards using the 7 iron, 160 yard using the 6 iron, 170 yards using the 5 iron, and so on.
      <br/>
      Thus, a golfer playing with a correlated set of irons may choose with confidence the iron that is most suited for the particular shot type and shot distance being encountered.
      <br/>
      This is not necessarily true with a random collection of irons where the incremental difference in shot distance between the clubs may not be coordinated.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Additionally, each of the clubs in a correlated set typically share a consistent look, such as consistent markings, color combinations, or the type of polishing or texture of the club head and shaft.
      <br/>
      Although the common features do not necessarily affect the playability of the clubs, golfers generally feel most comfortable when playing with a correlated set of irons, rather than with a group of irons that was randomly collected.
      <br/>
      A correlated set of irons thus contributes to the important mental aspects of a golfer's game by increasing the golfer's confidence when hitting the ball.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Golf club manufacturers progressively vary certain standard structural features of the irons in a correlated set to achieve the difference in ball distance from the lower numbered to the higher numbered clubs.
      <br/>
      For example, the loft angle of the clubs, which is the angle between a vertical plane passing through the shaft axis and a plane passing through the strike surface of the club head, progressively increases moving from the long irons to the short irons.
      <br/>
      The greater loft angle in the short irons gives these irons an increased tendency to lift the ball upon impact so that the ball travels a shorter distance.
      <br/>
      Another standard structural feature that is varied is the length of the club shaft, which decreases moving from the long clubs to the short clubs.
      <br/>
      The lie angles of the irons are also varied to accommodate the different lengths of shafts throughout the complete set of iron clubs.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,480,145, 5,665,009, and 5,388,826 to Sherwood disclose a correlated set of golf clubs having features that vary progressively from the lower numbered clubs to the higher numbered clubs.
      <br/>
      For example, the long irons have a larger planar strike area than the shorter irons to increase the size of the sweet spot for the long irons.
      <br/>
      These patents also disclose that the size of the rear cavity on the irons may decrease as the club shaft becomes shorter.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      While manufacturers have varied the aforementioned features throughout the clubs in a single set of irons, there are also certain fundamental or basic design characteristics that have conventionally remained constant or homogeneous throughout all of the clubs in a coordinated, conventional set of irons.
      <br/>
      For example, one correlated set of irons may have a "cavity back" design wherein all of the clubs in the set have a cavity on the rear face of the club head.
      <br/>
      The cavity promotes a peripheral distribution of mass to increase the size of the sweet spot of the club and thereby makes the club easier to hit.
      <br/>
      Another correlated set of irons may have a "blade" design wherein all of the club heads generally are in the shape of a flattened blade.
      <br/>
      The blade design concentrates more mass directly behind the ball for a more solid and more controllable shot than the cavity-back irons.
      <br/>
      Specifically, a blade design provides the golfer with greater feedback to enable the golfer to more precisely alter a stroke to achieve the desired results.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cavity-back type of irons generally provide a more forgiving, although less controllable, shot than blade-type irons.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Yet another basic design characteristic that typically remains constant throughout all of the clubs in a coordinated, conventional set of irons is the material that is used to manufacture the club heads.
      <br/>
      For example, one correlated set of irons may comprise heads manufactured of titanium, which is a strong, lightweight material.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, a set of titanium clubs is extremely expensive because of the high cost of titanium.
      <br/>
      Another correlated set of iron clubs may have heads that are manufactured of steel.
      <br/>
      A set of steel clubs is less expensive than titanium clubs.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Unfortunately, the performance of the specific clubs in a set may be adversely affected if all of the clubs include the same basic design characteristics.
      <br/>
      For example, the increased precision of the blade design may not be optimal for the long irons, where the emphasis should be toward enhancing the playability of the clubs by making it easier to get the ball airborne.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the cavity-back design is not necessarily suited for the shortest irons, which should emphasize feel and feedback and, therefore, controllability of the ball.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Additionally, the material used to manufacture the club head should not necessarily be consistent throughout all of the clubs in a correlated set.
      <br/>
      The use of light-weight titanium is highly suited for the longer irons, where the weight savings allows the club head to be made larger to increase the size of the sweet spot.
      <br/>
      However, using titanium may be inefficient and unnecessarily costly for the shorter irons, where controllability of the ball, rather than weight savings, is emphasized.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The design characteristics of the clubs should be specifically directed toward improving the specific playing needs of each of the clubs or groups of clubs in the set.
      <br/>
      For example, the properties of easy playability and forgiveness should be promoted for the long irons.
      <br/>
      The property of controllability of the shot should be promoted for the short irons.
      <br/>
      The middle irons should preferably be designed to compromise between playability and precision.
      <br/>
      These objectives are not necessarily accomplished if the clubs in a correlated set are united by a single, basic design characteristic.
    </p>
    <p num="16">There is therefore a need for a correlated set of golf clubs wherein each club or a group of clubs in the set utilizes technology that is specifically designed to promote the playing needs of that particular type of club.</p>
    <p num="17">
      In one aspect of the invention, there is disclosed a correlated set of golf clubs, comprising at least a first iron having a first club head.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 1 shows a set 30 of iron-type golf clubs.
      <br/>
      The set 30 generally comprises a first group 32 of iron-type golf clubs, a second group 34 of iron-type golf clubs, and a third group 36 of iron-type golf clubs.
      <br/>
      Each golf club within a common group has structural properties that are selected to enhance the specific playing requirements of the type of club within the group, as described in more detail below.
      <br/>
      The structural properties of the clubs provide a unique trend in the vertical positions of the centers of gravity of the club heads in the set 30 wherein the vertical distance of the center of gravity to ground is smaller for the long irons than the medium or short irons, as described in more detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the first group 32 preferably includes the long irons, such as, for example, the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 irons.
      <br/>
      The second group 34 preferably includes the middle or medium irons, such as, for example, the 6, 7, 8 and 9 irons.
      <br/>
      The third group 36 preferably includes the short irons, such as, for example, the sand wedge and the pitching wedge.
      <br/>
      Preferably, each club is only within one of the groups 32, 34, or 36 for a given set 30 of clubs.
      <br/>
      Desirably, as shown in FIG. 29, the entire set 30 of clubs is packaged within a single piece of packaging, such as a carton designed for shipment and, preferably, display of the set of irons.

      FIG. 2 is a rear view of an iron-type golf club head 38 from the first group 32.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional side view of the club head 38 along line 3--3 of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      All four iron heads in the first group 32 have the same general structure, which generally comprises a main body 40 and a weight insert 74 attached thereto, as described in more detail below.
      <br/>
      A hosel 41 extends upwardly from the main body 40 for attaching to a shaft in a well known manner.
      <br/>
      The main body 40 includes an upper portion 42, a lower portion or sole 44, a heel portion 46 and a toe portion 50.
      <br/>
      The main body 40 further includes a front side 52 (FIG. 3) that defines a strike surface 54 for striking a golf ball, and a rear side 56 which includes a rear cavity 60 that extends into the golf club head 38 toward the front side 52.
      <br/>
      The rear cavity 60 forms a substantially flat back or base surface 61 that is opposed to the strike surface 54.
      <br/>
      An annular surface 63 extends outwardly from the base surface 61 and defines the periphery of the rear cavity 60.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The strike surface 54 is oriented at a loft angle A relative to a line I--I passing through the axis B of the hosel 41.
      <br/>
      The loft angle A gradually increases as the club number increases for the clubs in the first group 32.
      <br/>
      Thus, although the club heads in the first group 32 have the same general structure, at least the loft angle desirably differs for each of the clubs in the first group 32.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The rear cavity 60 of the golf club head 38 is surrounded by a peripheral mass belt 62 comprising an extent of mass that surrounds the rear cavity 60.
      <br/>
      The peripheral mass belt 62 promotes a peripheral distribution of mass to maximize the inertia and increase the "sweet spot" of the golf club head 38.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The peripheral mass belt 62 includes a heel perimeter region 64 extending generally upwardly along the heel portion 46 of the club head 38, and a toe perimeter region 66 extending generally upwardly along the toe portion 50 of the club head 38.
      <br/>
      The peripheral mass belt 62 further includes an upper perimeter region 70 extending longitudinally along the upper portion 42 between upper edges of the heel perimeter region 64 and the toe perimeter region 66, and a lower perimeter region 72 extending longitudinally along the sole portion 44 of the club head 38 between lower edges of the heel perimeter region 64 and the toe perimeter region 66.
      <br/>
      The peripheral mass belt 62 forms a substantially flat rear surface 73.
      <br/>
      The peripheral mass belt 62 could also extend only partially around the rear cavity 60 and could vary in thickness at various locations.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      A weight insert 74 is attached to the main body 40 and forms the lower perimeter region 72 of the peripheral mass belt 62.
      <br/>
      As best shown in FIG. 2, the weight insert 74 extends horizontally along the lower perimeter region 72 and slightly upward along the toe perimeter region 66 and the heel perimeter region 64 so that the weight insert has a crescent-like shape.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, the weight insert 74 has a thickness that extends from the rear surface 73 of the peripheral mass belt 62 to the base surface 61 of the rear cavity 60 so that the peripheral mass belt 62 forms the lower region of the annular surface 63.
      <br/>
      The weight insert 74 is preferably located in a very low position on the club head 38 and toward the rear side 56 of the club head 38.
      <br/>
      Any suitable means, may be used to attach the weight insert 74 to the golf club head 38 such as, for example, screws, adhesion bonding, welding, brazing, press fitting, or any combination thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The main body 40 preferably constitutes the main portion of the volume of the club head 38.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the weight insert 74 represents 20% to 70% of the total weight of the club head 38 but comprises less than 50% of the total volume of the club head 38.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the weight insert 74 represents 35% to 60% of the total weight of the club head 38.
      <br/>
      Even more preferably, the weight insert 74 represents 45% to 60% of the total weight of the club head 38.
      <br/>
      As an example, for a 3-iron head having a total weight of 245 grams, the weight insert 74 is preferably approximately 100 grams, or 41% of the total weight of the 3-iron head.
      <br/>
      The main body 40 of the golf club head 38 is preferably made of a material having a low density (i.e., less than 7 grams per cubic centimeter).
      <br/>
      However, the main body 40 should also have high mechanical characteristics, such as a high elastic strength.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the main body 40 of the golf club head 38 is manufactured of titanium or a titanium alloy having a density of approximately 4.5 grams per cubic centimeter.
      <br/>
      Suitable materials are a Ti-6A1-4V-type alloy, which has an elastic strength on the order of 120,000 psi, or a Ti-3A1-2.5V-type alloy, which has an elastic strength on the order of 90,000 psi.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The weight insert 74 is preferably manufactured of a high density material (i.e., greater than at least 10 grams per cubic centimeter, and preferably between 12 and 20 grams per cubic centimeter).
      <br/>
      Some suitable materials for the weight insert 74 are tungsten, which has a density of approximately 19 grams per cubic centimeter, or a sintered mixture of tungsten and other metallic powders, such as iron, nickel, and/or copper.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the weight insert 74 does not increase the total weight of the club head 38 above a desired value, preferably 245 grams for a 3-iron, but rather redistributes the mass in a predetermined manner to enhance the hitting characteristics of the clubs in the first group 32.
      <br/>
      That is, the position, shape, and material of the weight insert 74 is particularly directed toward the playing needs or requirements of the long irons, with which golfers generally have a difficult time getting the ball airborne.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      As mentioned, the weight insert 74 is generally located in the sole portion 44 of the club head 38 so that the weight insert 74 has a low position on the club head 38.
      <br/>
      The low position of the weight insert 74 significantly lowers the center of gravity CG1 of the club head 38 so that more mass is below the golf ball at impact, which facilitates launching of the ball.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a weight insert which extends from the toe portion 50 to the heel portion 46, such as the crescent-like shaped weight insert 74 illustrated in FIG. 2, creates a high moment of inertia about a vertical axis through the center of gravity to thereby provide more forgiveness for off-center hits.
      <br/>
      The position of the weight insert 74 on the rear side 56 also improves the playability of the club head 38.
      <br/>
      The structure of the club head 38 of the first group 32 thus particularly improves the playability of the long irons by making it easier for the golfer to get the ball airborne and providing more forgiveness for off-center shots.

      FIG. 4 is a rear view of a golf club head 76 from the second group 34.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the golf club head 76 along line 5--5 of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      All of the club heads in the second group 34 have the same general structure of the club head 76, which is particularly directed toward enhancing the playing needs of the medium irons.
      <br/>
      However, at least the loft angle A differs between the club heads in the second group.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The golf club head 76 generally comprises a unitary main body 77 which is formed of a single piece of material and does not have a weight insert.
      <br/>
      The main body 77 includes an upper portion 78, a heel portion 80, a toe portion 82, and a lower portion or sole 84.
      <br/>
      The main body 77 also includes a front side 86 having a front strike surface 90 oriented at a loft angle A and a rear side 92 having a rear cavity 94 that extends toward the strike surface 90.
      <br/>
      The rear cavity 60 forms a substantially flat rear or base surface 95 that is opposed to the strike surface 54.
      <br/>
      An annular surface 97 extends outwardly from the base surface 94 and defines the periphery of the rear cavity 92.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      A peripheral mass belt 96 extends around the perimeter of the cavity 94 and preferably forms a continuous extended mass that surrounds the cavity 94.
      <br/>
      The peripheral mass belt 96 includes a heel perimeter region 98 extending generally upward along the heel portion 80 and a toe perimeter region 100 extending generally upwardly along the toe portion 82.
      <br/>
      The peripheral mass belt 96 further includes an upper perimeter region 104 extending longitudinally along the upper portion 78 between upper edges of the heel perimeter region 98 and the toe perimeter region 100, and a lower perimeter region 106 extending longitudinally along the sole portion 84 between lower edges of the heel perimeter region 98 and the toe perimeter region 100.
      <br/>
      As mentioned, the peripheral mass belt 96 comprises a single extent of mass of the golf club head 76 illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5 and thus does not include a weight insert like the golf club head 38 of the first group 32.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The club head 76 of the second group 34 desirably has a similar general shape as the club head 38 of the first group 32.
      <br/>
      However, the club head 76 of the second group 34 is preferably smaller in size than the club head 38 in the first group 32 in order to provide more precision or control in the shot while still having a relatively large sweet spot.
      <br/>
      The club head 76 is thus suited for the medium irons, which should emphasize both precision and playability.
      <br/>
      The set 30 could also be divided into two groups, wherein the first group includes the 1-4, 1-5, or 1-6 irons and the second group includes the next clubs in sequence after the last club in the first group up to the lob wedge.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The club head 76 of the second group 34 is preferably manufactured of a material having a higher density than the main body 40 of the club head 38 of the first group 32.
      <br/>
      Desirably, the club head 76 is manufactured of a material having a density greater than 5 grams per cubic centimeter, and more preferably between 6 and 9 grams per cubic centimeter.
      <br/>
      The aforementioned range of densities allows for the production of heads with the aforementioned structure and also allows the manufacturer to position the center of gravity to suit playing needs of the clubs in the second group 34.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The choice of a higher density material also allows the club head 76 in the second group 34 to be made smaller in size while maintaining the conventional total weight of the head.
      <br/>
      A 7-iron has a conventional total head weight of approximately 270 grams.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the club head 76 in the second group 34 is manufactured of a steel or a steel alloy.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, steel is less expensive than titanium so that the cost of the set 30 of clubs is reduced by using steel where appropriate.

      FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view of the club head 108 along line 7--7 of FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      As mentioned, the third group 36 of clubs heads preferably includes the short irons, such as the pitching wedge and the sand wedge.
      <br/>
      All club heads in the third group 36 have the same general structure of the club head 108, which is particularly directed toward enhancing the playing needs of the short irons, such as improving the control of these irons.
      <br/>
      Desirably, the position of the centers of gravity CG1, CG2, CG3, gradually moves upward relative to the sole portions of the clubs moving from the first group 32 to the second group 34, to the third group 36, as described in greater detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The club head 108 generally comprises a unitary main body 110 having a hosel 111 extending upwardly therefrom.
      <br/>
      The main body 110 includes an upper portion 112, a sole portion 114, a heel portion 116, and a toe portion 120.

      The club head 108 also includes a front side 122 having a strike surface 124, and a rear side 126 including a rear cavity 130.
      <br/>
      The rear cavity 130 forms a rear or base surface 131 that is opposed to the strike surface 124.
      <br/>
      An annular surface 134 extends outwardly from the base surface 131 and defines the periphery of the rear cavity 92.

      A peripheral mass belt 132 surrounds the rear cavity 130.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The rear cavity 130 preferably has a volume that is smaller than the volume of the rear cavity 94 in the club head 76 of the second group 34.

      The distribution of mass to the periphery of the club head 108 is thus limited to thereby concentrate more mass behind the ball and improve the feel and control of the club head 108.
      <br/>
      Desirably, the volume of the rear cavity 130 may be reduced by varying the thickness t of the club head 108 in the region of the rear cavity 130.
      <br/>
      The thickness t is the distance from the strike surface 124 to the base surface 131 of the rear cavity 130.

    <p num="52">
      FIG. 7 illustrates the preferred distribution of mass in the rear cavity 130.
      <br/>
      The base surface 131 includes a bulged or thick portion 138 at the center of the base surface 131.
      <br/>
      The thick portion 138 is formed by the base surface 131 curving outwardly so as to define an increased thickness t at the center of the base surface 131.
      <br/>
      The thickness t of the club head 108 preferably gradually decreases moving away from the thick portion 138 toward the annular surface 135 in order to form a progressive thickness variation.
      <br/>
      Desirably, the thickness t of the club head 108 in the region of the rear cavity 130 also increases toward the sole portion 114 to concentrate more mass near the sole portion 114 so that the center of gravity CG3 of the club head 108 is relatively close to the sole portion 114.
      <br/>
      Desirably, the center of gravity CG3 is approximately 0.7 inches from the bottom surface of the club head 108.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the bulged portion 138 is located behind the point on the strike surface 124 where the ball impacts the club head 108.

      FIG. 8 is a rear view of an alternative embodiment of a long iron club head 38a from the first group 32.

      The club head 38a has essentially the same structure as the club head 38 of the previous embodiment.
      <br/>
      However, in this embodiment, the weight insert 74a occupies a more central portion of the lower perimeter region 72 of the peripheral mass belt 62 so that the weight insert 74a is smaller from heel to toe in size than the weight insert 74 (FIG. 2) from the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      The weight insert 74a does not extend entirely from the toe portion 50 to the heel portion 46.

      The weight insert 74a lowers the center of gravity CG1 of the club head 38a, as described above with respect to the previous embodiment.
      <br/>
      However, the moment of inertia around a vertical axis passing through the center of gravity is kept at a lower value than the club head 38 of the first embodiment to provide enhanced feedback to the golfer regarding off-center hits and force of impact.

      The club head 76a has essentially the same structure as the club head 76 of the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      However, the club head 76a includes a separate face insert 144 that is attached to the front side 86 of the main body 77 of the club head 76a.

      The face insert 144 forms the strike surface 90.
      <br/>
      The face insert 144 is preferably formed of a material having a lower density than the density of the main body 77 of the head 76a.
      <br/>
      A thinner insert formed from an equivalent density, but higher strength material can also be utilized.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the face insert 144 is manufactured of titanium, a titanium alloy, aluminum or an aluminum alloy.
      <br/>
      The use of an insert 144 allows more weight to be distributed at the periphery of the head, thus increasing the moment of inertia of the head around a vertical and/or horizontal axis through the center of gravity.
      <br/>
      The insert also allows the strike face area to be increased for a given club head weight.

      <br/>
      The weight insert 170 is desirably manufactured of a heavier material than the main body 40, such as tungsten alloy.
      <br/>
      The use of light-weight titanium or aluminum is highly suited for the long irons of the first group 156.
      <br/>
      The weight savings provided through the use of titanium or aluminum allows the club head 38b to be made larger and increase the size of the sweet spot.
      <br/>
      The weight insert 170 advantageously lowers the position of the center of gravity of the club head 38b, as described in more detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The position of the weight insert 170 provides certain advantages.
      <br/>
      The low position relative to the rear cavity 60 facilitates manufacturing of the club head 38b.
      <br/>
      Because the weight insert 170 does not break into the annular surface 63 surrounding the rear cavity 60, the weight insert does not have to be shaped to match the shape of the annular surface 63.
      <br/>
      This eliminates additional finishing processes that are often necessary to smoothly blend the juncture between the weight insert and the annular surface surrounding the rear cavity in cases where the weight insert breaks into the annular surface.

    <p num="65">
      With reference to FIGS. 20 and 21, there is shown an exemplary club head 76b from the second group 158.
      <br/>
      The club head 76b has the same general structure as the club head 76a as described above with respect to FIGS. 10 and 11. Thus, like reference numerals will be used between like parts of the club heads 76a and 76b.
      <br/>
      As best shown in FIG. 20, the club head 76b includes a first weight insert 174 and a second weight insert 176 that are attached to the main body 77 of the club head 76b.
      <br/>
      The first weight insert 174 is positioned below the rear cavity 94 near the heel portion 80 of the club head 76b.
      <br/>
      The second weight insert 176 is positioned near the toe portion 82 such that it has a shape and position that preferably mirrors the shape and position of the weight insert 174.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      In another embodiment of the club head 76b shown in FIG. 22, the weight inserts 174 and 176 are replaced by a single weight insert 178 that extends from the heel portion 80 to the toe portion 82 of the club head 76b.
      <br/>
      The weight insert 178 or weight inserts 174 and 176 could also be mounted within a cavity in the club head 76b, such as was described above with respect to the club head 38b shown in FIGS. 18 and 19.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      With reference to FIG. 21, the club head 76b could also include a face insert 144 that is attached to the front side 86 of the main body 77 of the club head 76b.
      <br/>
      The face insert 144 forms the strike surface 90 of the club head 76b.
      <br/>
      The club head 76b could be equipped with any combination of the face insert 144 and the weight inserts 174, 176, or 180 on the main body 77.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The main body 77 of the club head 76b is desirably manufactured of a hard material, such as steel.
      <br/>
      The face insert 144 is desirably manufactured of a stronger and/or lighter material than the main body 77, such as titanium or aluminum, and the weight inserts 174 and 176 (or the weight insert 178) are desirably manufactured of a higher density material than the main body 77, such as a tungsten alloy.
      <br/>
      The use of a face insert 144 enhances perimeter weighting.
      <br/>
      Additionally, light-weight face inserts reduce the amount of weight consumed in the region of the strike surface 90.
      <br/>
      The weight savings allows more mass to be used in the periphery of the club head 76b to thereby increase the stability of the club head 76 for off-centered shots.
      <br/>
      Because the relatively high-priced titanium or aluminum is only used for the face insert 144, the cost of the club head 76b is lower than if the entire club head 76b were manufactured of titanium or aluminum.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      With reference to FIGS. 23-25, there is shown an exemplary club head 108b from the third group 160.
      <br/>
      The club head 108b has the same structure of the club head 108 as described above with respect to FIGS. 6 and 7.
      <br/>
      Thus, like reference numerals will be used between like parts of the club heads 108 and 108b.
      <br/>
      As mentioned above with respect to FIG. 7, the club head 108b includes a bulged or thick portion 138 (FIG. 25) immediately behind the theoretical point of impact of the strike surface 124 on the ball.
      <br/>
      The thick portion 138 could be eliminated on the lower numbered clubs so that the rear surface 131 of the rear cavity 130 is substantially flat, such as shown in FIG. 24. It is contemplated that the thickness between the rear surface 131 on the rear cavity 130 and the strike surface 124 could gradually increase moving from the lower-numbered to the higher-numbered irons of the third group 160 so that the size of the thick portion 138 also gradually increases.
      <br/>
      The club head 108b is desirably manufactured of steel.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      FIGS. 26 and 27 show an exemplary club head 180 from the fourth group 162.
      <br/>
      The club head 180 is a blade-type club head having a unitary main body 182 that includes a flat strike surface 184 and a rear surface 186 opposed thereto.
      <br/>
      The distribution of the thickness between the strike surface 184 and the rear surface 186 is preferably selected to concentrate more mass in a central region behind the strike surface 184, preferably immediately behind the theoretical point of impact with a golf ball.
      <br/>
      This provides a more solid shot and increases the controllability of the ball when hit by the club head 180.
      <br/>
      This is highly desirable for the wedge-type irons that comprise the fourth group 162.
      <br/>
      The club head 180 is desirably manufactured of forged or cast steel.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      FIG. 28 shows a general feature which may be common to all of the club heads in the first, second, and third groups 132, 134, and 136, respectively.
      <br/>
      The strike surface (referred to generally using reference numeral 142) of each of the clubs in the set 30 may increase progressively in size from the shorter clubs to the longer clubs (i.e., from the sand wedge to the number 2 club).
      <br/>
      Advantageously, the increase in the size of the strike surface 142 provides a gradual increase in the size of the sweet spot.
      <br/>
      The greater sweet spot size increases the likelihood of a desirable result even on off-centered shots.
      <br/>
      The larger size of the sweet spot for the long irons thus increases the golfer's confidence and contributes to the important psychological aspects of the game.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the size of the strike surface of the irons in the set 30 could remain substantially constant.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      With reference to FIG. 28, the strike surface 142 desirably has predetermined indicia or markings that are identical for all of the clubs in the set 30 to identify the clubs as being part of the set 30.
      <br/>
      For example, the strike surface could include a predetermined pattern of grooves 144.
      <br/>
      The strike surface 142 could also include a left and right border lines 146 and 148.
      <br/>
      The area within the border lines 146 and 148 could be a different color than the rest of the club head to highlight the strike surface 142.
      <br/>
      Alternately, a single border line could surround the strike surface 142, such as is shown in FIG. 12.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      If desired, the number of groups within the set 30 or the distribution of the irons within the groups may be varied.
      <br/>
      For example, in another embodiment, the set 30 may comprise two groups of clubs wherein the first group includes the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 irons and the second group comprises the 7, 8, and 9 irons and the pitching wedge.
      <br/>
      The clubs that make up each group could also be varied.
      <br/>
      For example, the first group could comprises the 1, 2, 3, and 4 irons and the second group could comprise the 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 irons and the pitching wedge.
      <br/>
      As mentioned, for a given set 30 of irons, each club is part of only a single group.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The aforementioned structures of the club heads in the set 30 result in a unique trend regarding the vertical positions of the centers of gravity of the club heads in the set 30.
      <br/>
      That is, preferably, the vertical positions of the centers of gravity generally rise or at least remain steady relative to the bottom or sole of the clubs moving from the lower-numbered clubs to the higher-numbered clubs.
      <br/>
      With reference to FIGS. 30 and 30A, the vertical position of the center of gravity CG of an exemplary club head 200 from the set 30 is described with reference to the vertical position D of the center of gravity CG relative to a ground plane P. The club head 200 has a hosel 201, a front face 202 and a strike portion 204 thereon.
      <br/>
      The strike portion 204 contains grooves 205.
      <br/>
      A forward lower edge 206 connects the front face 202 with the sole 208 of the club head 200.
      <br/>
      The vertical position D of the center of gravity CG is the vertical distance between the center of gravity CG and a ground plane P when the club head 200 is oriented at the address position with the grooves 205 parallel to the ground plane P and the axis B of the hosel 201 contained in a plane perpendicular to the ground plane P.
