    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention is directed to the inhibition of cell proliferation and/or cell matrix production and/or cell movement (chemotaxis) and/or T cell activation and proliferation using of quinoline/quinoxaline compounds which are useful protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).</p>
    <p num="4">
      Cellular signaling is mediated through a system of interactions which include cell-cell contact or cell-matrix contact or extracellular receptor-substrate contact.
      <br/>
      The extracellular signal is often communicated to other parts of the cell via a tyrosine kinase mediated phosphorylation event which affects substrate proteins downstream of the cell membrane bound signaling complex.
      <br/>
      A specific set of receptor-enzymes such as the insulin receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) or platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) are examples of tyrosine kinase enzymes which are involved in cellular signaling.
      <br/>
      Autophosphorylation of the enzyme is required for efficient enzyme-mediated phosphorylation of substrate proteins containing tyrosine residues.
      <br/>
      These substrates are known to be responsible for a variety of cellular events including cellular proliferation, cellular matrix production, cellular migration and apoptosis to name a few.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is understood that a large number of disease states are caused by either uncontrolled reproduction of cells or overproduction of matrix or poorly regulated programmed cell death (apoptosis).
      <br/>
      These disease states involve a variety of cell types and include disorders such as leukemia, cancer, glioblastoma, psoriasis, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, fibrotic diseases, atherosclerosis and restenosis occurring subsequent to angioplasty of the coronary, femoral or kidney arteries or, fibroproliferative disease such as in arthritis, fibrosis of the lung, kidney and liver.
      <br/>
      In addition, deregulated cellular proliferative conditions follow from coronary bypass surgery.
      <br/>
      The inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity is believed to have utility in the control of uncontrolled reproduction of cells or overproduction of matrix or poorly regulated programmed cell death (apoptosis).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It is also known that certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors can interact with more than one type of tyrosine kinase enzyme.
      <br/>
      Several tyrosine kinase enzymes are critical for the normal function of the body.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      For instance, it would be undesirable to inhibit insulin action in most normal circumstances.
      <br/>
      Therefore, compounds which inhibit PDGF-R tyrosine kinase activity at concentrations less than the concentrations effective in inhibiting the insulin receptor kinase could provide valuable agents for the selective treatment of diseases characterized by cell proliferation and/or cell matrix production and/or cell movement (chemotaxis) such as restenosis.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      This invention relates to the modulation and/or inhibition of cell signaling, cell proliferation, extracellular matrix production, chemotaxis, the control of abnormal cell growth and cell inflammatory response.
      <br/>
      More specifically, this invention relates to the use of substituted quinoxaline compounds which exhibit selective inhibition of differentiation, proliferation or mediator release by effectively inhibiting platelet-derived growth factor-receptor (PDGF-R) tyrosine kinase activity and/or Lck tyrosine kinase activity.
    </p>
    <p num="9">2. Reported Developments</p>
    <p num="10">
      A number of literature reports describe tyrosine kinase inhibitors which are selective for tyrosine kinase receptor enzymes such as EGF-R or PDGF-R or non-receptor cytosolic tyrosine kinase enzymes such as v-ab1, p56lck or c-src.
      <br/>
      Recent reviews by Spada and Myers (Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1995, 5(8), 805) and Bridges (Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1995, 5(12), 1245) summarize the literature for tyrosine kinase inhibitors and EGF-R selective inhibitors respectively.
      <br/>
      Additionally Law and Lydon have summarized the anticancer potential of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Emerging Drugs: The Prospect For Improved Medicines 1996, 241-260).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Known inhibitors of PDGF-R tyrosine kinase activity includes quinoline-based inhibitors reported by Maguire et al. (J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 2129), and by Dolle et al. (J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 2627).
      <br/>
      A class of phenylamino-pyrimidine-based inhibitors was recently reported by Traxler et al. in EP 564409 and by Zimmerman, J.; and Traxler, P. et al. (Biorg. &amp; Med. Chem. Lett. 1996, 6(11), 1221-1226) and by Buchdunger, E. et al. (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 1995, 92, 2558).
      <br/>
      Despite the progress in the field there are no agents from these classes of compounds that have been approved for use in humans for treating proliferative disease.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The correlation between the multifactorial disease of restenosis with PDGF and PDGF-R is well-documented throughout the scientific literature.
      <br/>
      However, recent developments into the understanding of fibrotic diseases of the lung (Antoniades, H. N.; et al. J. Clin. Invest. 1990, 86, 1055), kidney and liver (Peterson, T. C. Hepatology, 1993, 17, 486) have also implicated PDGF and PDGF-R as playing a role.
      <br/>
      For instance glomerulonephritis is a major cause of renal failure and PDGF has been identified to be a potent mitogen for mesangial cells in vitro as demonstrated by Shultz et al. (Am. J. Physiol. 1988, 255, F674) and by Floege, et al. (Clin. Exp. Immun. 1991, 86, 334).
      <br/>
      It has been reported by Thornton, S. C.; et al. (Clin. Exp. Immun. 1991, 86, 79) that TNF-alpha and PDGF (obtained from human rheumatoid arthritis patients) are the major cytokines involved in proliferation of synovial cells.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, specific tumor cell types have been identified (see Silver, B. J., BioFactors, 1992, 3, 217) such as glioblastoma and Kaposi's sarcoma which overexpress either the PDGF protein or receptor thus leading to the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells via an autocrine or paracrine mechanism.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is anticipated that a PDGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor would be useful in treating a variety of seemingly unrelated human disease conditions that can be characterized by the involvement of PDGF and or PDGF-R in their etiology.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The role of various non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as p56lck (hereinafter "Lck") in inflammation-related conditions involving T cell activation and proliferation has been reviewed by Hanke, et al (Inflamm. Res. 1995, 44, 357) and by Bolen and Brugge (Ann. Rev. Immunol., 1997, 15, 371).
      <br/>
      These inflammatory conditions include allergy, autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis and transplant rejection.
      <br/>
      Another recent review summarizes various classes of tyrosine kinase inhibitors including compounds having Lck inhibitory activity (Groundwater, et. al Progress in Medicinal Chemistry, 1996, 33, 233).
      <br/>
      Inhibitors of Lck tyrosine kinase activity include several natural products which are generally non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as staurosporine, genistein, certain flavones and erbstatin.
      <br/>
      Damnacanthol was recently reported to be a low nM inhibitor of Lck (Faltynek, et. al, Biochemistry, 1995, 34, 12404).
      <br/>
      Examples of synthetic Lck inhibitors include: a series of dihydroxy-isoquinoline inhibitors reported as having low micromolar to submicromolar activity (Burke, et. al J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 425); and a quinoline derivative found to be much less active having an Lck IC50 of 610 micromolar.
      <br/>
      Researchers have also disclosed a series of 4-substituted quinazolines that inhibit Lck in the low micromolar to submicromolar range (Myers et al, WO95/15758 and Myers, et. al Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997, 7, 417).
      <br/>
      Researchers at Pfizer (Hanke, et. al J. Biol. Chem. 1996, 271, 695) have disclosed two specific pyrazolopyrimidine inhibitors known as PP1 and PP2 which have low nanomolar potency against Lck and Fyn. (another Src-family kinase).
      <br/>
      No Lck inhibitory has been reported regarding quinoline or quinoxaline based compounds.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is anticipated that a quinoline or quinoxaline based inhibitor of Lck tyrosine kinase activity could be useful in treating a variety of seemingly unrelated human disease conditions that can be characterized by the involvement of Lck tyrosine kinase signaling in their etiology.

    <p num="107">
      Where the compound of the present invention is substituted with a basic moiety, acid addition salts are formed and are simply a more convenient form for use; and in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the free base form.
      <br/>
      The acids which can be used to prepare the acid addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose anions are non-toxic to the patient in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial inhibitory effects on PDGF inherent in the free base are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the anions.
      <br/>
      Although pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said basic compounds are preferred, all acid addition salts are useful as sources of the free base form even if the particular salt, per se, is desired only as an intermediate product as, for example, when the salt is formed only for purposes of purification, and identification, or when it is used as intermediate in preparing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by ion exchange procedures.
      <br/>
      Pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention are those derived from the following acids: mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and sulfamic acid; and organic acids such as acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malonic acid, methanesufonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclohexylsulfamic acid, quinic acid, and the like.

      According to a further feature of the invention, acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention are prepared by reaction of the free base with the appropriate acid, by the application or adaptation of known methods.
      <br/>
      For example, the acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention are prepared either by dissolving the free base in aqueous or aqueous-alcohol solution or other suitable solvents containing the appropriate acid and isolating the salt by evaporating the solution, or by reacting the free base and acid in an organic solvent, in which case the salt separates directly or can be obtained by concentration of the solution.

      The balloon may be chaperoned by a protective sheath as the catheter is advanced toward the target vessel, in order to minimize drug washoff after the catheter is introduced into the bloodstream.

      Another embodiment of the invention provides for a compound according to the invention to be administered by means of perfusion balloons.
      <br/>
      These perfusion balloons, which make it possible to maintain a blood flow and thus to decrease the risks of ischaemia of the myocardium, on inflation of the balloon, also enable the compound to be delivered locally at normal pressure for a relatively long time, more than twenty minutes, which may be necessary for its optimal action.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a channelled balloon catheter ("channelled balloon angioplasty catheter", Mansfield Medical, Boston Scientific Corp., Watertown, Mass.) may be used.
      <br/>
      The latter consists of a conventional balloon covered with a layer of 24 perforated channels which are perfused via an independent lumen through an additional infusion orifice.
      <br/>
      Various types of balloon catheters, such as double balloon, porous balloon, microporous balloon, channel balloon, balloon over stent and hydrogel catheter, all of which may be used to practice the invention, are disclosed in Reissen et al. (1994), the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

      The percentage of active ingredient in the compositions of the invention may be varied, it being necessary that it should constitute a proportion such that a suitable dosage shall be obtained.
      <br/>
      Obviously, several unit dosage forms may be administered at about the same time.
      <br/>
      A dose employed may be determined by a physician or qualified medical professional, and depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, the route of administration and the duration of the treatment, and the condition of the patient.
      <br/>
      In the adult, the doses are generally from about 0.001 to about 50, preferably about 0.001 to about 5, mg/kg body weight per day by inhalation, from about 0.01 to about 100, preferably 0.1 to 70, more especially 0.5 to 10, mg/kg body weight per day by oral administration, and from about 0.001 to about 10, preferably 0.01 to 10, mg/kg body weight per day by intravenous administration.

    <p num="310">
      The compounds/compositions according to the invention may be administered as frequently as necessary in order to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.

      Some patients may respond rapidly to a higher or lower dose and may find much weaker maintenance doses adequate.
      <br/>
      For other patients, it may be necessary to have long-term treatments at the rate of 1 to 4 doses per day, in accordance with the physiological requirements of each particular patient.
      <br/>
      Generally, the active product may be administered orally 1 to 4 times per day.

      The compounds of the present invention may be used in the treatment of restenosis post angioplasty using any device such as balloon, ablation or laser techniques.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the present invention may be used in the treatment of restenosis following stent placement in the vasculature either as 1) primary treatment for vascular blockage, or 2) in the instance where angioplasty using any device fails to give a patent artery.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the present invention may be used either orally, by parenteral administration or the compound could be applied topically through the intervention of a specific device or as a properly formulated coating on a stent device.

      Other suitable polymers include non-degradable polymers capable of carrying and delivering therapeutic drugs such as latexes, urethanes, polysiloxanes, styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene block copolymers (SEBS) and biodegradable, bioabsorbable polymers capable of carrying and delivering therapeutic drugs, such as poly-DL-lactic acid (DL-PLA), and poly-L-lactic acid (L-PLA), polyorthoesters, polyiminocarbonates, aliphatic polycarbonates, and polyphosphazenes.
    </p>
    <p num="315">
      A porosigen may also be incorporated in the drug loaded polymer by adding the porosigen to the polymer along with the therapeutic drug to form a porous, drug loaded polymeric membrane. "Porosigen" means as any moiety, such as microgranules of sodium chloride, lactose, or sodium heparin, for example, which will dissolve or otherwise be degraded when immersed in body fluids to leave behind a porous network in the polymeric material.
      <br/>
      The pores left by such porosignes can typically be a large as 10 microns.
      <br/>
      The pores formed by porosignes such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyethylene oxide/polypropylene oxide (PEO/PPO) copolymers, for example, can also be smaller than one micron, although other similar materials which form phase separations from the continuous drug loaded polymeric matrix and can later be leached out by body fluids can also be suitable for forming pores smaller than one micron.
      <br/>
      The polymeric material can be applied to the stent while the therapeutic drug and porosigen material are contained within the polymeric material, to allow the porosigen to be dissolved or degraded by body fluids when the stent is placed in a blood vessel, or alternatively, the porosigen can be dissolved and removed from the polymeric material to form pores in the polymeric material prior to placement of the polymeric material combined with the stent within a blood vessel.
    </p>
    <p num="316">
      If desired, a rate-controlling membrane can also be applied over the drug loaded polymer, to limit the release rate of the compound of the invention.

      The rate-controlling membrane can be added by applying a coating form a solution, or a lamination.
      <br/>
      The rate-controlling membrane applied over the polymeric material can be formed to include a uniform dispersion of a porosigen in the rate-controlling membrane, and the porosigen in the rate-controlling membrane can be dissolved to leave pores in the rate-controlling membrane typically as large as 10 microns, or as small as 1 micron, for example, although the pores can also be smaller than 1 micron.
      <br/>

    <p num="323">
      In addition to plasma deposition and vapor phase deposition, other techniques for applying the various coatings on the stent surfaces may be employed.

      A substrate (tyrosine-containing substrate, Biot-( BETA  Ala)3 -Lys-Val-Glu-Lys-Ile-Gly-Glu-Gly-Thr-Tyr-Glu-Val-Val-Tyr-Lys-(NH2) recognized by P56lck, 1  MU M) is first phosphorylated in presence or absence of a given concentration of the test compound, by a given amount of enzyme (enzyme is produced by expression of P56lck gene in a yeast construct) purified from a cloned yeast (purification of the enzyme is done by following classical methods) in the presence of ATP (10  MU M) MgCl2 (2.5 mM), MnCl2 (2.5 mM), NaCl (25 mM), DTT (0.4 mM) in Hepes 50 mM, pH 7.5, over 10 min at ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      The total reaction volume is 50  MU l, and the reactions are performed in a black 96-well fluoroplate.
      <br/>
      The reaction is stopped by addition of 150  MU l of stopping buffer (100 mM Hepes pH7.5, KF 400 mM, EDTA 133 mM, BSA 1 g/l.) containing a selected anti tyrosine antibody labeled with the Europium cryptate (PY20-K) at 0.8  MU g/ml and allophycocyanine-labelled streptavidin (XL665) at 4  MU g/ml.
      <br/>
      The labeling of Streptavidin and anti-tyrosine antibodies were performed by Cis-Bio International (France).
      <br/>
      The mixture is counted using a Packard Discovery counter which is able to measure time-resolved homogeneous fluorescence transfer (excitation at 337 nm, readout at 620 nm and 665 nm).
      <br/>
      The ratio of the 665 nm signal/620nm signal is a measure of the phosphorylated tyrosine concentration.
      <br/>
      The blank is obtained by replacing enzyme by buffer.
      <br/>
      The specific signal is the difference between the ratio obtained without inhibitor and the ratio with the blank.
      <br/>
      The percentage of specific signal is calculated.
      <br/>
      The IC50 is calculated with 10 concentrations of inhibitor in duplicate using Xlfit soft.
      <br/>
      The reference compound is staurosporine (Sigma) and it exhibits an IC50 of 30 +- 6 nM (n=20).

    <p num="358">8. Measurement of Tumor Inhibition In Vitro</p>
    <p num="359">The inhibition of tumor growth in vitro by the compounds of this invention is determined as follows:</p>
    <p num="360">
      C6 rat glioma cell line (provided by ATCC) is grown as monolayers in Dubelcco's Modified Eagle Medium containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 U/ml penicillin, 200  MU g/ml streptomycin and supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated foetal calf serum.
      <br/>
      Cells in exponential phase of growth are trypsinized, washed with PBS and diluted to a final concentration of 6500 cells/ml in complete medium.
      <br/>
      Drug to be tested or control solvent are added to the cell suspension (2.5 ml) under a volume of 50  MU l and 0.4 ml of 2.4% Noble Difco agar maintained at 45 (degree)  C. are added and mixed.
      <br/>
      The mixture is immediately poured into Petri dishes and left standing for 5 minutes at 4 (degree)  C. The number of cellular clones (&gt;60 cells) are measured after 12 days of incubation at 37 (degree)  C. under 5% CO2 atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Each drug is tested at 10, 1, 0. 1, and 0.01  MU g/ml (final concentration in the agar) in duplicate.
      <br/>
      Results are expressed in percent inhibition of clonogenicity relatively to untreated controls.
      <br/>
      IC50 's are determined graphically from semi-logarithmic plots of the mean value determined for each drug concentration.
    </p>
    <p num="361">9. Measurement of Tumor Inhibition In Vivo</p>
    <p num="362">The inhibition of tumor growth in vivo by the compounds of this invention is determined using a subucatenous xenograft model as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,700,823 and 5,760,066, in which mice are implanted with C6 glioma cells and tumor growth is measured using venier calipers.</p>
