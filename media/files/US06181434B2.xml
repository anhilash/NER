      A print control apparatus capable of performing either a mixed print process or an independent print process in accordance with a print mode, the mixed print process printing sequentially received print data on the same recording sheet, and the independent print process printing print data next received on a new recording sheet after the previous recording sheet is ejected.
      <br/>
      If a sensor detects that a first recording sheet remains in a printer engine when second print data is received by an interface, a CPU controls to execute either the mixed print process or the independent print process in accordance with the set state of a first print mode set by a mode setter.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a print control apparatus and a method of controlling a process of printing an image on a recording sheet in accordance with print data input via an interface, and a storage medium storing print control programs, and more particularly to a serial printer for printing information while a head as a print unit is reciprocally scanned and a recording sheet is transported in a direction perpendicular to the scan direction of the head.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Printers of this type, particularly serial printers, are each equipped with a plurality of interfaces and perform a print process by automatically exchanging interfaces in accordance with reception conditions of print data, reciprocally scanning a head and transporting a recording sheet in a direction perpendicular to the scan direction of the head.
      <br/>
      A print process is also performed by receiving a printer control command and print data from a host computer, and a printed recording sheet is ejected upon reception of a paper ejection command to thereby complete a series of print sequences.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Depending upon an application program or specific emulation program (page descriptive language analysis program) of a host computer, a paper ejection command among printer control commands is not supplied from the host computer and the printed sheet is left in the printer even after the print process is completed.
      <br/>
      A printed sheet may also be left in the printer when the print process is suspended because of some trouble of the host computer.

    <p num="6">In a process of printing information supplied from a non-PC apparatus such as a digital camera, an Internet television and a television game machine, since the non-PC apparatus has no means for editing image data and the format of each print data is different, each print data is printed independently on a different recording sheet.</p>
    <p num="7">FIGS. 9A to 9C are schematic diagrams illustrating a continuous print state when there is a remaining sheet in a conventional print control apparatus.</p>
    <p num="8">FIG. 9A illustrates print data, e.g., text data of a page unit first received, FIG. 9B illustrates print data, e.g., graphics data, and FIG. 9C illustrates a print output obtained by receiving print data from an unrepresented first interface, printing it out, stopping printing without receiving a paper ejection command, immediately thereafter receiving print data from an unrepresented second interface and resuming printing.</p>
    <p num="9">With a printer having such a paper ejection control, for example, after the print data shown in FIG. 9A is printed out and the printed sheet remains in the printer, if the next print data shown in FIG. 9B is received from another interface, both the print data shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B and received from different interfaces are printed out on the same sheet.</p>
    <p num="10">Further, if any trouble occurs while print data supplied from a host computer via a first interface is printed and if data is received from another host computer via a second interface while the printed sheet remains in the printer, both the print data are printed out on the same sheet.</p>
    <p num="11">Still further, as described above, according to the related art, in order to print a plurality of files such as shown in FIGS. 10A to 10C on a single sheet such as shown in FIG. 10D, it is necessary to print the files after editing them by application software.</p>
    <p num="12">Furthermore, in order to print a mixed document such as shown in FIG. 11D having image data such as a photograph and text data, application software for desk-top publishing is usually required.</p>
    <p num="13">If image data is to be written in a document by using application software such as "Photoshop", the text data is also required to have the information amount generally same as the image data so that the size of each file becomes large.</p>
    <p num="14">After a photograph such as shown in FIG. 11A is directly printed from a digital camera, the printed sheet is again placed on a paper feed cassette and print data such as shown in FIG. 11B is printed in a superposed manner to obtain the print result shown in FIG. 11D. In this case, the print start position of the print data shown in FIG. 11B is required to be shifted.</p>

    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Reference numeral 115 represents a mode setter for setting a first or second paper ejection mode (paper ejection mode 1 or 2 in the drawings).
      <br/>
      When the first paper ejection mode is set, if a sensor 116 detects a recording sheet remained in the printer engine 112 when data is received from one interface after data from the other interface was printed out, then a new recording sheet is supplied to start printing after the printed sheet is ejected.
      <br/>
      When the second paper ejection mode is set, if the sensor 116 detects a recording sheet remained in the printer engine 112 when data is received from one interface after a predetermined time (measured with the timer 114) after data from the same interface was printed out, then a new recording sheet is supplied to start printing after the printed sheet is ejected.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the type of the set paper ejection mode, CPU 110 controls the print process of the printer engine 112.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The sensor 116 detects whether a recording sheet remains in a paper transport unit of the print control apparatus.
      <br/>
      Since this sensor 116 can detect whether a recording sheet remains in a print designated area, it is possible not to print data on an area where there is no recording sheet.
      <br/>
      In this invention, by utilizing the detection results by the sensor 116, the process of printing the next print data is controlled.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      In a serial printer as one example of the print control apparatus of this invention, the paper ejector 117 serving as paper transport means transports a recording sheet in a direction perpendicular to a scan direction of a print head while the print head is reciprocally scanned during printing.
    </p>
    <p num="60">FIGS. 2A and 2B are diagrams illustrating an interface exchange process to be executed by the print control apparatus shown in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="61">
      Referring to FIG. 2A, both the interfaces 103A and 103B are in a standby state at time a, and can receive data from either from the host 102A or 102B.
      <br/>
      When data arrives at time b, the interface 103A receives it.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      In this case, the interface 103B is in an unselected state.
      <br/>
      Although the data reception by the interface 103A is completed at time c, the interface 103B holds this unselected state until a predetermined time lapses.
    </p>
    <p num="63">If there is no data transmission until time d, both the interfaces 103A and 103B enter again the standby state at time d, similar at time a. When data arrives at time e, the interface 103B receives it, similar at time b.</p>
    <p num="64">
      Referring to FIG. 2B, if data transmission starts at time g before a predetermined time does not lapse after data transmission by the interface 103A was completed, the selected state of the interface 103A continues to receive the next data.
      <br/>
      In this case, the interface 103B maintains the unselected state.
    </p>
    <p num="65">The characteristic structure of this embodiment will be described in the following.</p>
    <p num="66">

    <p num="118">The mode setter of the print control apparatus of the fourth embodiment has, as shown in FIG. 12, a mode switch and a paper ejection switch both mounted on an operation panel, the mode switch being capable of selecting either an ordinary print mode and a mixed print mode.</p>

      With a conventional print control apparatus, the print process as in FIG. 10D cannot be performed.

      At Step 1, it is checked whether a paper feed command has been transmitted.
      <br/>
      As print data including the paper feed command is transferred at Step 1, the print mode set with the mode setter 115 is checked at Step 2.

      In this print control apparatus 101, as the reset switch 1204 of the mode setter 115 is selected, the ordinary print mode is selected as a default.
      <br/>
      As described previously, the mode may be set not only with the mode setter 115, but also with the host computer 102A which transmits a control command for switching between print modes.

    <p num="124">
      At Step 3, the sensor 116 as a detecting means checks a presence of a recording sheet or medium.
      <br/>
      If a recording sheet is detected at Step 3, the recording sheet is ejected with the paper ejector 117 at Step 4.
      <br/>
      If a recording sheet is not detected at Step 3 or after the recording sheet is ejected at Step 4, a recording sheet is fed from the paper cassette 113 at Step 5.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      At Step 6, data is printed on the recording sheet with the printer engine 112 serving as print means.

      It is checked at Step 7 whether a paper eject command has been transmitted.
      <br/>
      If transmitted at Step 7, the recording sheet is ejected with the paper ejector at Step 8.
      <br/>
      In the above manner, each time data is transmitted, the paper feed process, print process and paper eject process are repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      The above processes are performed in the ordinary print mode which is the first embodiment print processing of the print control apparatus, typically a serial printer.

    </p>
    <p num="127">If the mixed print switch 1202 of the mode setter 115 is selected at Step 2, i.e., if the mixed print mode is selected, the sensor checks at Step 9 a presence of a recording sheet.</p>

      If a recording sheet is not detected at Step 9, a recording sheet is fed from the paper cassette at Step 10.
      <br/>
      If a recording sheet is detected at Step 3, the flow advances to Step 11 in order to print data on the detected recording sheet by neglecting or disregarding the paper feed command transmitted at Step 1.
      <br/>
      After Step 9 or Step 10, data is printed on the recording sheet with the printer engine 112 at Step 11.
      <br/>
      It is checked at Step 12 whether the paper eject command has been transmitted or whether all the image data has been completely transmitted.
      <br/>
      If the paper eject command has been transmitted or all the image data has been completely transmitted at Step 12, the print process is terminated by neglecting the paper eject command, i.e., without ejecting the recording sheet with the paper ejector 117.
      <br/>
      In other words, the print process is terminated without ejecting the recording sheet.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, each time print data is transmitted, the print process is repeated by neglecting the paper feed command and paper eject command.
    </p>
    <p num="129">In parallel with the print processes described with the flow chart of FIG. 13, the control process illustrated in the flow chart of FIG. 14 is performed. (13) and (14) are steps of the control process.</p>

      At Step 13 in FIG. 14, it is checked whether the paper eject switch 1203 of the mode setter 115 has been depressed.

    <p num="131">FIG. 15 illustrates the transmission operation of a printer driver of the host computer 102A to transmit three sets of the paper feed command, print data and paper eject command.</p>

      After print data A is printed, the paper eject command is neglected or disregarded.
      <br/>
      Upon reception of the next paper feed command, this command is neglected because the recording sheet is already present.
      <br/>
      After print data B is printed, the paper eject command is neglected.
      <br/>
      Similarly, in printing print data C, the paper feed and eject commands are neglected to perform only the print process.
    </p>
    <p num="133">After the print data C is printed, the paper eject switch is depressed to eject the recording sheet printed as shown in FIG. 10D.</p>
    <p num="134">The printer driver of the host computer 102A performs only the same control of transferring print data as in a conventional manner, i.e., performs only the generation and transmission of print data, and the control by the print control apparatus only realizes the mixed print mode.</p>
    <p num="135">In printing data supplied from an apparatus without a printer driver such as a digital camera and Internet television, the mixed print mode can be realized on the side of the print control apparatus.</p>
    <p num="136">
      For example, after the print data such as shown in FIG. 11A supplied from the digital camera 102B is printed, the paper eject command is neglected.
      <br/>
      Since the format of the image data received from the digital camera 102B differs depending upon the specification of each digital camera, the image data input from the digital camera is developed into bit map data by the translator 106.
      <br/>
      Upon reception of a print request of print data constituted of text data such as shown in FIG. 11C supplied from the host computer 102A, the paper feed command in the print data is neglected and the print process is performed.
      <br/>
      Also the paper eject command in the print data is neglected by the print control apparatus 101.
      <br/>
      As CPU judges that the paper eject switch 1203 has been depressed, the recording sheet with mixed images such as shown in FIG. 11D is ejected with the paper ejector 117.
      <br/>
      In the above manner, a user can easily form a mixed image.
    </p>
    <p num="137">As above, according to the fourth embodiment, for example, after print data from the host computer is printed, print data from another data source (such as a host computer and a digital camera) is mixed and printed on the same recording sheet, without ejecting it, and the recording sheet can be ejected at a timing when a user depresses the paper eject switch.</p>

      <br/>
      Accordingly, a print environment can be configured in which print data is not printed mixedly inadvertently on the same recording sheet.
