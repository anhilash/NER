    <p num="12">
      The foregoing patents reflect the state of the art of which the applicant is aware and are tendered with a view toward discharging applicant's acknowledged duty of candor in disclosing information that may be pertinent in the examination of the application.
      <br/>
      It is respectfully stipulated, however, that none of these patents teach or render obvious, singly or when considered in combination, applicant's claimed invention.
    </p>
    <p num="13">3. Problems with the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="14">
      In recent years, activities such as scrapbooking, art, assembling school reports, preparing formal presentations or business reports, collecting baseball cards, photography, and other related pursuits have increasingly involved the use of envelopes, pouches, and sheet-protectors to protect important documents or other items from being folded, touched, bent, or otherwise intentionally or unintentionally defaced or injured.
      <br/>
      These envelopes and sheet protectors are produced from various materials in many shapes and sizes, some punched to fit into three-ring binders; some sized specifically to fit photographs, cards or stamps particular sizes; some for use in shipping; and others made to accommodate fill-sized sheets of paper.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Common to the use of many of these sheet protectors, however, are several difficulties.
      <br/>
      First, due to their plastic construction, they are difficult to open since the individual sides of the sheet protector adhere together.
      <br/>
      Second, once the sides have been initially separated, static electricity tends to pull and hold the two sides of the sheet protector tightly together, making it difficult to insert desired items.
      <br/>
      Attempts to force documents, etc., into such protectors can cause some of the very damage the sheet protector is intended to prevent.
      <br/>
      Further, many of the applications noted above call for the insertion of two documents into a sheet protector--one facing each direction.
      <br/>
      This is often difficult since the static electricity which held the sides of the sheet protector together also holds papers previously inserted into the protector.
      <br/>
      This makes insertion of a second document similarly difficult, and again brings up the risks of wrinkling, bending, or folding noted above.
    </p>
    <p num="16">There is thus a need for an insert apparatus which is easily inserted into a sheet protector or similar pouch or envelope, holds the sides of the sheet protector apart, allows for easy insertion of an item, allows for the insertion of a second item, and which is then easily removed without withdrawing the items thus inserted.</p>

    <p num="33">CHARTER BY THE U.S. CONSTITUTION</p>
    <p num="34">This disclosure of the invention is submitted in furtherance of the constitutional purposes of the United States Patent Laws "to promote the progress of science and useful arts," as stated in Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="35">
      Referring to FIG. 1 there is a top view of an insert apparatus in its inserted position.
      <br/>
      Specifically, there is an insert apparatus 10, having holding region 12, bending region 13, finger holes 14, nonbending (or "flattened") region 15, soft finger guards 16, diminishing angle 17, transition zone 11, insert feet 18, center line 19, and gripping space 20.
      <br/>
      Shown with the apparatus in FIG. 1-FIG. 4 is envelope (or "pouch") 22, used for protecting items such as but not limited to photographs, documents, baseball cards, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      FIG. 2 is an end view of FIG. 1 taken along line 2 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Specifically, a bending of insert apparatus 10 and its subsequent insertion into envelope 22 creates insert cavity 24.
      <br/>
      Cavity 24 allows for the easy insertion of items into envelope 22.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      FIG. 3 is a side view of FIG. 1, showing insert apparatus 10 in its inserted position.
      <br/>
      Uniquely, in operation, insert feet 18, located in non-bending region 15, are placed into the envelope first.
      <br/>
      Apparatus 10 is then bent by applying pressure either inwardly to finger holes 14, or to a space between finger holes 14, thus causing the apparatus to bend along a line such as center line 19.
      <br/>
      The resilient nature of apparatus 10 causes its edges to fit snugly against the edges of envelope 22, as apparatus 10 is slid into envelope 22, thus holding envelope 22 open and creating insert cavity 24.
      <br/>
      Items may then be inserted into insert cavity 24.
      <br/>
      To remove apparatus 10, the user grips envelope 22 and the item inserted on gripping space 20, and then withdraws apparatus 10 from envelope 22, leaving the inserted item within envelope 22.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      FIG. 4 is an end view of FIG. 1 taken along line 4 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Uniquely, FIG. 4 differs from FIG. 2 in that in FIG. 4, insert apparatus 10 has been deflected along center line 19 in a direction opposite from that shown in FIG. 2, thus opening insert cavity 24 on the opposite side of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      This allows for the insertion of a second document, photograph, or other item into envelope 22 without requiring the removal and reinsertion of apparatus 10.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Remarks About the Preferred Embodiment</p>
    <p num="40">
      One of ordinary skill in the art of designing document handling equipment will realize many advantages from using the preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      First, a skilled artisan would appreciate that gripping space 20 predisposes the location for bending of the insert apparatus 110.
      <br/>
      This predisposed bending location reduces the amount of resistance that must be overcome when bending insert apparatus 110.
      <br/>
      Additionally, gripping space 20 allows the user to hold the inserted items in place while apparatus 10 is removed.
      <br/>
      In regard to this final point, without the gripping space, static electricity would cause items to adhere to insert apparatus 10, thus causing them to exit envelope 22 when apparatus 10 is withdrawn.
      <br/>
      Uniquely, gripping space 20 allows a user to pinch together the sides of envelope 22, thus holding any inserted items in place while apparatus 10 is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Further, a skilled artisan would recognize that the existence of gripping space 20 allows insert feet 18 to remain in a flat position, but angled to each other, and not curved, like the rest of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      This characteristic allows insert feet 18 to better conform to the flat end of envelope 22.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      A skilled artisan would similarly appreciate that the gripping space 20 creates two distinct regions on the apparatus-bending region 13 and non-bending region 15.
      <br/>
      Such an artisan would see that the increased area given by the curved shape of bending region 13 allows for easy insertion of items, while the angled non-bending region 15 helps to guide items into place within the envelope without allowing damage.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Similarly, one skilled in the art would recognize the benefits of the transition zone 11 found roughly in the area outlined in the figures.
      <br/>
      This zone is where bending region 13 gradually flattens out to nonbending region 15.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      A skilled artisan would further recognize the benefits of the apparatus's gradual decrease in width along the bending section 13 to the ends of insert feet 18.
      <br/>
      The narrower width at the edge of the apparatus 10 by the insert feet 18 allows for easy insertion into sheet protectors or other pouches, while causing a gradual decrease in the curving of apparatus 10 along its length.
      <br/>
      In bending region 13, apparatus 10 is at its widest, thus causing a wide insert cavity 24 to be formed upon insertion into envelope 22.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      One skilled in this art would similarly recognize the benefits of the curved nature of the apparatus in its bent form.
      <br/>
      By laying documents or photographs against the curved face of apparatus 10 and allowing the documents to conform to the curved face, their edges are located away from envelope 22.
      <br/>
      Thus, document edges are easily inserted without becoming caught on the sides of envelope 22.
    </p>
    <p num="46">One skilled in the art would further recognize that when the insert apparatus is not actuated, (or "bent"), all elements of the illustrated invention are coplanar.</p>
    <p num="47">
      Finally, one skilled in this art would highly value the property of the preferred embodiment to be inverted.
      <br/>
      Specifically, after loading one document into envelope 22, apparatus 10 may be inverted by applying pressure to the convex surface of the device, thus closing insert cavity 24 and securing the document against the formerly open side of envelope 22, while opening a new insert cavity 24 on the opposite side of apparatus 10, thus allowing for the insertion of a second object into envelope 22.
    </p>
    <heading>VARIATIONS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="48">
      A skilled artisan would consider it an obvious design change to use different sizes and dimensions of plastic sheets in constructing the apparatus in order to accommodate different types or sizes of page protectors, envelopes, or pouches.
      <br/>
      Further, although herein referred to as "envelopes" or "pouches," one skilled in the art would understand that the invention may be used with any pouch used to protect documents or other items, such as but not limited to sheet protectors, envelopes, pouches, stamp protectors, baseball card protectors, photo album protectors, and scrapbook page protectors.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      In addition, the apparatus 10 could be varied in thickness in order to provide easier bending, or greater strength and resilience.
      <br/>
      The spacing of finger holes 14 could be varied, according to size or purpose of the apparatus, and the finger guards could be either removed or augmented.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the finger holes themselves could be omitted--especially with smaller sizes of the apparatus--or augmented.
      <br/>
      The narrowing of the apparatus from bending region to non-bending region could be accentuated, lessened, or reversed to better suit individual purposes.
      <br/>
      Further, gripping space 20 could be made deeper or more shallow, or the width of gripping space 20 could be expanded or narrowed.
      <br/>
      The gripping space could be made in any shape, such as v-shaped, u-shaped, circular, heart-shaped, square, oval, etc.
      <br/>
      Changes in the gripping space depth could also be made to allow for a narrower paper cavity 24, and a longer non-bending region 15.
      <br/>
      Further, secondary gripping spaces could be added to give alternative places for holding items in place after inserted.
      <br/>
      Angle 17 can be a constant along the length or can change to a greater or lesser angle along the length of apparatus 10.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      While the invention has been taught with specific reference to these embodiments, someone skilled in the art will recognize that changes can be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive.
      <br/>
      The scope of the invention is thus indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description.
      <br/>
      All changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.
