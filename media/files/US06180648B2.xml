    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Cocaine abuse is one of the greatest concerns of the American public today, and has therefore become a focus of medical, social and political leaders.
      <br/>
      Cocaine is one of the most addictive substances known, and addicts may lose their ability to function at work or in interpersonal situations.
      <br/>
      Drug dependence and the great profits that are made throughout the distribution network of cocaine have fueled a rise in drug-associated crime in the United States and in Colombia.
      <br/>
      Although the incidence of casual cocaine use has decreased substantially in the last few years, the number of weekly users is rising.
      <br/>
      The rise has accompanied a change in the chemical form often used to free base, or "crack," and the route of administration used from nasal to inhalation by smoking or intravenous injection.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Psychological and behavioral approaches are important in a treatment program because peer pressure and environmental cues are closely associated with a relapse to addiction.
      <br/>
      However, behavioral observations have identified a window of about ten weeks after cessation of cocaine use where the susceptibility to relapse is greatest.
      <br/>
      Clearly, there is a need to increase the success rate of outpatient detoxification programs through the development of pharmacological agents that will assist during this critical period.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Currently a number of treatment strategies are being looked at using CNS agents developed for other indications.
      <br/>
      The agents being tried include, among others, the indirect dopamine agonist, amantadine, the direct agonist bromocriptine, the partial mu opiate receptor agonist, buprenorphine, and the tricyclic antidepressant, desipramine.
      <br/>
      While these agents appear to depress either self-administration or cocaine "craving" under certain circumstances, these studies are still in their early stages and the efficacy of such treatments has not been established.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The behavioral properties of cocaine, including its abilities to act as a reinforcer, are thought to stem from its ability to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine (DA).
      <br/>
      While cocaine also has the ability to act as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake as well as to bind to sigma opiate and muscarinic receptors, the potencies of cocaine and analogs in self-administration studies correlate best with their DA transporter inhibitor activities.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the precise mechanism by which cocaine inhibits dopamine uptake is still uncertain.
      <br/>
      Several laboratories have shown that cocaine inhibition of dopamine uptake into striatal synaptosomes is consistent with a classic, fully competitive mechanism.
      <br/>
      However these data are also consistent with more complex models, including allosteric or partially competitive, and several others involving steric hindrance, distinct but overlapping sites or multiple binding sites in which at least one is required for both cocaine and dopamine binding.
      <br/>
      In addition, a recent study using rotating disk electrode voltammetry, which is capable of monitoring uptake with a 50 msec resolution, suggests that cocaine inhibits dopamine uptake uncompetitively while competitively blocking Na+ and Cl- binding to the carrier.
      <br/>
      While these data have not been validated using other experimental approaches, they further support the idea that the cocaine and dopamine binding sites are unique.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      N-Ethylmaleimide (NE) is capable of inhibiting about 95% of the specific binding of �3 H�mazindol, and the effect of 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide is completely prevented by 10  MU M cocaine, while neither 300  MU M dopamine nor d-amphetamine afforded any significant protection.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a recent study of the structure of the dopamine transporter revealed that aspartate and serine residues lying within the first and seventh hydrophobic putative membrane spanning regions were critical for dopamine uptake, but less so for �3 H�CFT (WIN-35428) binding.
      <br/>
      For example, replacement of the serine residues at positions 356 and 359 in the seventh hydrophobic region by alanine or glycine reduced �3 H�DA uptake, whereas �3 H�CFT (WIN-35428) binding was less affected.
      <br/>
      More recent experiments with DA and NE transporter chimeras show that transmembrane domains 6-8 determine cocaine binding while domains 9-12 plus the carboxy tail are responsible for DA binding affinity.
      <br/>
      Thus, these data support the hypothesis that a significant portion of the cocaine binding domain on the dopamine transporter is distinct from that of either dopamine or amphetamine.
      <br/>
      This distinction may be sufficient to allow properly designed drugs to prevent cocaine binding without inhibiting dopamine uptake.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The most promising agents for treating cocaine abuse, may be agents which possess the ability to mimic partially the effects of cocaine, thereby helping to maintain individuals in treatment programs while they slowly withdraw from cocaine.
      <br/>
      Such an agent would function like methadone, a drug widely used in the treatment of opiate abuse.
      <br/>
      A compound with methadone-type activity against cocaine abuse is likely to be a partial agonist of cocaine; namely, a substance that elicits some of the same effects in the user as cocaine itself, but without causing the same degree of euphoria.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the compound should have little or no abuse liability.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Thus there is currently a need for therapeutic agents that can be used to treat cocaine abuse.</p>

      <br/>
      R6 is hydrogen, (C1 -C6)alkyl, (C1 -C6)alkanoyl, or S(O)2 Rh ;

    <p num="13">
      Unexpectedly, it has been found that compounds of formula (I) can bind to the cocaine recognition site with an affinity comparable to that of cocaine; additionally, the compounds also act as potent inhibitors of dopamine uptake.
      <br/>
      It has been observed in drug discrimination studies in rats, that such compounds exhibit only weak cocaine- and amphetamine-like effects.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the invention thus appear to partially mimic cocaine's discriminative stimulus effects.
      <br/>
      Of further note are the results obtained from intravenous drug self-administration studies carried out using rats.
      <br/>
      In these studies, the animals trained to self-administer cocaine failed to self-administer the present compounds.
      <br/>
      In locomotor activity studies the compounds were found to have weak motor stimulant effects.
      <br/>
      Compounds with these properties may be useful for treating drug abuse or for treating disorders wherein modulation of dopamine or serotonin uptake is desired.

    <p num="20">
      The invention also provides a method comprising binding a compound of formula I to mammalian tissue comprising dopamine receptors, in vivo or in vitro, by contacting said tissue with an amount of a compound of formula I effective to bind to said receptors.
      <br/>
      Tissue comprising dopamine receptors with compounds of formula I bound thereto can be used as a pharmacologic tool to identify potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases or conditions associated with dopamine function, by contacting the agents with the tissue, and measuring the extent of displacement of the compound of formula I and/or binding of the agent.
      <br/>
      Tissue comprising dopamine receptors with compounds of formula I bound thereto can also be used generally to elucidate the physiological function of neurotransmitters.

      For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like.
      <br/>
      Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound.
      <br/>
      The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form.

      Compound 2 was evaluated in the drug discrimination procedure described by: Callahan, P. M., Bryan, S. K., and Cunningham, K. A. (1995) Discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine: antagonism by dopamine DI receptor blockade in the amygdala.

      In Substitution tests, amphetamine administration engendered a dose-dependent and complete substitution for the discriminative stimulus effects of amphetamine, whereas administration of the piperidine analog 2 resulted in a maximum of 53% amphetamine-lever responding.
      <br/>
      Response rates remained fairly stable across all test doses of amphetamine and piperidine analog 2.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      Cocaine (1.25-10 mg/kg) administration resulted in a dose-related increase in cocaine-appropriate responding, whereas piperidine analog 2 (5 and 20 mg/kg) engendered a maximum of 40% cocaine-lever responding.
      <br/>
      Response rates following piperidine analog 2 (5 and 10 mg/kg) were substantially lower than those observed following cocaine (10 mg/kg) administration.
      <br/>
      Co-administration of piperidine analog 2 (10 mg/kg) plus cocaine (1.25 and 5 mg/kg) did not significantly alter drug choice �F(1,7)=1.35, p=0.28� or response rate performance �F(1,7)=4.84, p=0.06� from that observed following administration of 1.25 and 5 mg/kg of cocaine alone (data not shown).
      <br/>
      This result is in contrast to other dopamine uptake inhibitors that are known to cause a leftward shift in cocaine's dose-response function.
      <br/>
      These results suggest that the piperidine analog differs from other uptake inhibitors in lacking the potentiation of cocaine's discriminative stimulus effects.

    <p num="102">Compounds 2 and 3 were evaluated using the intravenous drug self-administration procedures described by: Tella, S. R., Ladenheim, B., Andrews, A. M., Goldberg, S. R., and Cadet, J. L. (1996) Differential reinforcing effects of cocaine and GBR-12909: Biochemical evidence for divergent neuroadaptive changes in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. J. Neurosci., 16, 7416-7427.</p>

      Rats were initially trained to lever press for food pellets in standard operant boxes.
      <br/>
      Following lever press training, rats were implanted with polyvinyl chloride catheters into femoral veins under halothane anesthesia (2-3% in medical grade oxygen) and were allowed to recover for an additional 7 days before initiation of i.v. drug self-administration testing.
      <br/>
      During drug self-administration sessions, food pellets were no longer delivered, and instead intravenous injections of drugs were delivered by way of the catheter.
      <br/>
      Each completion of 10 lever press responses (FR10) resulted in an i.v. infusion of cocaine (1 mg/kg/infusion) delivered over a 1 second period.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      Following approximately 3 weeks of cocaine self-administration, the extinction test was done by substituting saline (0.25 ml/kg) for cocaine for 5 days.
      <br/>
      Following extinction, re-acquisition of cocaine (1 mg/kg/infusion) self-administration was tested for 5 days.
      <br/>
      Following re-acquisition of cocaine self-administration, the saline extinction test was repeated.
      <br/>
      Following this second extinction test, self-administration of piperidine analog 2 was studied at doses of 1, 3, and 0.3 mg/kg/infusion in that order.
      <br/>
      Each dose was tested for five days.
      <br/>
      During all the re-acquisition test days, a priming infusion was given at the start of the session on each day.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Cocaine maintained significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher rates of responding as compared to the responding during the saline extinction test.
      <br/>
      The substitution of saline for cocaine led to a decline in the response rate.
      <br/>
      The substitution of piperidine analog 2 (0.3-3 mg/kg/infusion) for saline failed to restore the self-administration responding.
      <br/>
      The number of infusions of the piperidine analog delivered at all of the doses tested were not significantly different from that of the saline extinction test.
      <br/>
      These data suggest that the piperidine analog, unlike cocaine, lacks positive reinforcing effects.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the piperidine analog 3 is cocaine-like in this test, as evidenced by the fact that rats reliably self-administered this compound (0.125-0.5 mg/kg infusion).
    </p>
    <p num="106">D. Effects of test compounds on cocaine self-administration and food reinforcement</p>
    <p num="107">
      The effect of pretreatment with test compound on cocaine self-administration can be studied.
      <br/>
      Five minutes following intravenous injection of test compounds, rats can be tested for cocaine self-administration.
      <br/>
      The doses that fall on both the ascending and the descending portions of the cocaine dose-response function can be tested following pretreatment with test compounds.
      <br/>
      This allows for a determination of whether there is a left- or rightward shift or downward shift in the cocaine dose-response function.
      <br/>
      Compounds showing overall reduction (downward shift) in cocaine self-administration can be further tested for the specificity of this effect.
      <br/>
      This can be done by studying the effect of test compound on non-drug reinforcers such as food.

    <p num="109">
      The cis and trans isomers of 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(carbomethoxy)piperidine were labeled via N-methylation. 11 C-methyl iodide was bubbled into a solution of each of the piperidine isomers (1.5 mg free base in 0.3 cc DMSO) and the mixtures were heated at 110 (degree)  C. for 7 minutes.
      <br/>
      The products were purified by HPLC on a C-18 cartridge eluted with MeOH: phosphate/triethylamine buffer, pH 7.2 (60:40).
      <br/>
      The 11 C-labeled drugs were produced in good radiochemical yield �.about.15%@EOS�. Radiochemical purities of the final products were&gt;98% and specific activity were routinely&gt;2,000 mCl/ MU mole �EOS�.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      After passage through a 0.22  MU m filter, the sterile products were administered to three Rhesus monkeys and dynamic PET images were acquired over 90 minutes.
      <br/>
      Both isomers accumulated rapidly in the striatum with the cis isomer exhibiting greater nonspecific accumulation in the cortex.
      <br/>
      Studies with low specific activity tracer showed reduced striatal-to-cerebellar ratios compared with high specific activity preparations.
      <br/>
      When unlabeled CFT was administered 60 minutes after injection of the trans isomers, a selective decrease in the striatal activity was observed; consistent with in vivo binding to the dopamine transporter.
    </p>
    <p num="111">These results establish that both the cis- and trans isomers of 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-carbomethoxy-N-methylpiperidine have high levels of specific binding to striatal dopamine transporter sites.</p>
    <p num="112">
      The 3-n-propyl derivative (-)-9 was found to have a binding affinity of 3 nM.
      <br/>
      Thus compound 9 is 33-fold more potent than cocaine in binding affinity, and 29-fold more potent in its inhibition of dopamine uptake.
      <br/>
      The above results demonstrate that representative compounds of formula I possess significant binding activity at the dopamine receptor.
      <br/>
      Accordingly compounds of the invention may be useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of drug abuse (e.g. cocain addiction).
      <br/>
      Additionally, compounds of formula I, and in particular, compounds wherein R6 is hydrogen, may also possess activity as serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, compounds of formula I may also be useful for inhibiting serotonin reuptake, and thus for treating Parkinson's disease or depression.
