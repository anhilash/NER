      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a composition of dielectric for a plasma display panel.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Nowadays, there have been actively developed flat display devices such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), a field emission display(FED), a plasma display panel (PDP) and so on.
      <br/>
      In the flat display devices, the PDP has advantages in that it permits an easier manufacturing according to its simple structure, and a higher efficiency in the brightness and emission in comparison to other flat display devices.
      <br/>
      Further, the PDP has advantages in that it has not only a memory function, a light view angle more than 160 (degree) , but also it permits an implementation of a large-scale screen more than 40 inches.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a conventional PDP that includes a lower glass substrate 14 mounted with an address electrode 2, a lower dielectric layer 18 applied on the lower glass substrate 14 in a predetermined thickness to form a wall charge, barrier ribs 8 defined on the lower dielectric layer 18 to divide each discharging cell, a fluorescent layer 6 excited and radiated by a light generated during the plasma discharge, a transparent electrode 4 defined on the upper glass substrate 16, an upper dielectric layer 12 applied on the upper glass substrate 16 and the transparent electrode 4 in a predetermined thickness to form a wall charge, and a protective layer 10 applied on the upper dielectric layer 12 to protect the upper dielectric layer 12 from any sputtering due to the discharge.
      <br/>
      If a predetermined voltage(e.g., 200 V) is applied to the address electrode 2 and the transparent electrode 4, then a plasma discharge is generated in the inner side of the discharging cell by means of electrons emitted from the address electrode 2.
      <br/>
      More specifically, electrons emitted from the electrode 2 collides with atoms in a mixed gas of He gas and Xe gas or a mixed gas of Ne gas and Xe gas sealed in the discharging cell and ionizes the atoms in the mixed gas, thereby causing an emission of secondary electrons.
      <br/>
      The secondary electrons repeat a collision with the atoms in the mixed gas to thereby ionize the mixed gas atoms sequentially.
      <br/>
      In other words, they enter an avalanche process having electrons and ions increased into twice.
      <br/>
      A light generated in the avalanche process radiates the fluorescent layer of red(R), green(G), and blue(B) colors.
      <br/>
      The R, G and B lights emitted at the fluorescent layer progress, via the protective layer 10, the upper dielectric layer 12 and the transparent electrode 4, into the upper glass substrate 16 so as to display an image.
      <br/>
      It is necessary for the upper dielectric layer 12 and the lower dielectric layer 18 to have a characteristic different from each other.
      <br/>
      For example, the upper dielectric layer 12 requires to have a high transmission coefficient because it must transmit a light radiated from the fluorescent layer 6; whereas the lower dielectric layer 18 not only requires to have a high density structure and a high reflection coefficient because it must perform functions of improving a radiation efficiency as well as preventing a diffusion by reflecting the light radiated from the fluorescent layer 6 toward the upper glass substrate 16, but also it requires to have characteristics of a low thermal expansion coefficient, a thermal stability and a low dielectric constant and so on so as to prevent a crack.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A dielectric layer and a method thereof for meeting the requirements as mentioned above were disclosed in the Japanese patent publication No. 8-119665. The dielectric layer in the above Japanese patent publication No. 8-119665 has a composition as shown in Table 1.
      <br/>
      The composition ratio in Table 1 was given assuming a weight of dielectric layer to be 100 weight percent.

    </p>
    <p num="8">An alternative method of manufacturing the dielectric layer is disclosed in the Japanese Patent Publication No. 8-119665. In the method, first, a compound glass including PbO of 60 to 70 weight % or a glass-ceramics material mixing an oxide filler with the compound glass is prepared into a powder below 10  MU m. Subsequently, the powder is pasted into a state mixed with an organic vehicle and then the pasted powder is screen printed on the glass substrate into a thickness of 20 to 30  MU m. Finally, the paste screen-printed on the glass substrate is dried for 20 to 30 minutes at a temperature of 100 (degree)  C. and thereafter is sintered at a temperature range of 500 to 550 (degree)  C., thereby making a dielectric layer.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The dielectric layer manufactured in a manner as described above has problems in that it causes a delay phenomenon in an addressing time because its dielectric constant has a relatively high value of 12 to 15 and that it causes an increase in a weight of devices and the entire weight because the gravity of Pb is heavy.
      <br/>
      Another problem is glass that the glass containing PbO causes pollution.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="19">
      Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIG. 2 to FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      A dielectric layer according to the present invention is formed of a glass powder of SiO2 --ZnO--B2 O3 group or P2 O5 --ZnO--BaO group, a composition mixing the glass powder of SiO2 --ZnO--B2 O3 group with a filler (i.e., any one of the first to third fillers) powder, or a composition mixing the glass powder of P2 O5 --ZnO--BaO group with a filler(i.e., the fourth filler).
      <br/>
      In a manufacturing method of such a dielectric layer, a raw material according to a characteristic requirement of the dielectric layer is mixed at a desired composition ratio and melted and then cooled suddenly, thereby preparing a powder(i.e., the glass powder) of a fine-grain particle or powder or a mixture powder mixing the powder with a filler at a desired ratio.
      <br/>
      The powder(i.e., the glass powder) or the mixture powder is mixed with an organic vehicle at a desired ratio to thereby make it a paste state.
      <br/>
      Next, the paste is applied on a glass substrate into a desired thickness and then sintered at a desired temperature, thereby making the dielectric layer.
      <br/>
      The dielectric layer manufactured in this manner has improved optical, thermal and electrical characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Hereinafter, a composition of a dielectric layer and a manufacturing method thereof according to embodiments of the present invention will be explained below.

    <p num="26">
      Referring to FIG. 2, there are explained a method for manufacturing a dielectric layer for a plasma display panel according to the first embodiment of the present invention step by step.
      <br/>
      In step 1, a glass powder is prepared.
      <br/>
      More specifically, first, a row material of a SiO2 --ZnO--B2 O3 group glass or a P2 O5 --ZnO--BaO group glass is mixed at a component ratio in Table 2 or Table 3.
      <br/>
      The row material has a different component ratio as seen from Table 2 and Table 3, depending upon whether it is the SiO2 --ZnO--B2 O3 group glass or the P2 O5 --ZnO--BaO group glass.
      <br/>
      With reference to Table 2, the SiO2 --ZnO--B2 O3 group glass includes ZnO of 25 to 45 weight %, PbO of 3 to 40 weight %, SiO2 of 15 to 25 weight %, B2 O3 of 12 to 25 weight %, K2 O of 2 to 10 weight %, Na2 O of 2 to 8 weight %, Al2 O3 of 1 to 7 weight %, Li2 O of 1 to 5 weight %, and CaO of 1 to 5 weight %, With reference to Table 3, the P2 O5 --ZnO--BaO group glass includes P2 O5 of 45 to 65 weight %, ZnO of 20 to 35 weight %, BaO of 3 to 15 weight %, Li2 O of 2 to 10 weight %, Al2 O3 of 1 to 7 weight %, CaO of 1 to 6 weight %, and B2 O3 of 1 to 5 weight %. The SiO2 --ZnO--B2 O3 group glass or the P2 O5 --Zn--BaO group glass is prepared at the above-mentioned component ratio and the prepared material is mixed by means of a tumbling mixer driven for a desired time(e.g., 10 hours).
      <br/>
      Second, the mixed raw material is melted by putting it into a melting furnace.
      <br/>
      At this time, the melting condition is kept for about 5 hours at a temperature of 1100 (degree)  C. Also, the raw material is stirred two or three times so that it can be uniformly melted in the course of melting, and thus the melted glass has a delicate organization.
      <br/>
      Third, a power having fine-grain particles is made by providing a sudden cooling of a the melted glass.
      <br/>
      The melted glass passes through a quenching roller and, thereafter, is cooled suddenly, thereby producing glass cullets having minute cracks.
      <br/>
      The glass cullets are milled for a desired time(e.g., 16 hours) by the ball milling technique and thereafter passes through - 170 and - 270 sievers sequentially, thereby making a powder having a particle size of about 6  MU m. In this case, a quenching roller system is desirable for a production of the cullets and a cylindrical type of ball is preferably used in the milling works.

      In this embodiment, an oxide powder having a melting point below 580 (degree)  C. is used as the second filler.
      <br/>
      For example, LiI, LiNO3, NaNO, and KIO3 including Li, Na and K belonging to 1A group(i.e., elements having a single balance electron) in the periodic table are replaced by bridging oxygen ions of a glass molecule(i.e., a molecule having four balance electrons) to form a non-bridging oxygen.
      <br/>
      Such a non-bridging oxygen separates a continuous reticulated structure of the glass to reduce a sintering temperature of the glass.
      <br/>
      Also, B2 O3 including B belonging to 3A group(i.e., elements having three balance electrons) in the periodic table is replaced by bridging oxygen ions of a glass molecule(i.e., a molecule having four balance electrons) to form a non-bridging oxygen.
      <br/>
      Such a non-bridging oxygen separate a continuous reticulated structure of the glass to reduce a sintering temperature of the glass.
      <br/>
      Owing to this, the second filler prevents a thermal deformation of the dielectric layer and the substrate When the sintering temperature is high, a deformation of a soda-lime glass used as the substrate occurs.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the sintering temperature is too low, an air perforation is left due to an incomplete disposition of the dielectric layer to thereby cause a deterioration in a reflectivity and a surface luminance as well as a characteristic deterioration such as a reduction in a thermal stability and so on.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a sintering temperature range of the dielectric layer is preferably 500 to 580 (degree)  C. To this end, the second filler having a melting point below 580 (degree)  C. is used to lower an activation energy and cause a expedition of reaction according to an increase in a fluidity so as to permits a sufficient sintering below 580 (degree)  C.

      The dielectric layer formed in a manner as described above has a relatively low dielectric constant of 7 to 10 to thereby reduce a delay of addressing time and improve a surface luminance and a reflectivity of the dielectric layer.
      <br/>
      Also, the dielectric layer does not include PbO, so that its weight becomes light.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a thermal expansive coefficient of the dielectric layer approximates that of the glass substrate by mixing the fourth filler with the glass, thereby preventing a crack of the dielectric layer.
    </p>
    <p num="67">As described above, the dielectric composition for the plasma display panel according to the present invention has advantages in that the optical, thermal and electrical characteristic requirements in the dielectric layer can be met and that a weight of the dielectric layer becomes light.</p>

      Although the present invention has been explained by the embodiments shown in the drawings described above, it should be understood to the ordinary skilled person in the art that the invention is not limited to the embodiments, but rather that various changes or modifications thereof are possible without departing from the spirit of the invention.
      <br/>
      For example, the SiO2 --ZnO--B2 O3 group glass or the P2 O5 --ZnO--BaO group glass may be used as a dielectric composition in the embodiments of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Also, the first to third fillers may be selectively added to the SiO2 --ZnO--B2 O3 group glass and the fourth filler may be selectively added to the P2 O5 --ZnO--BaO group glass, depending on characteristic requirements in the dielectric layer.
