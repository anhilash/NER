      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a display and a method of and a drive circuit for driving the display, more particularly to a liquid crystal display (LCD) and a method of and a drive circuit for driving the same.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Recently, thin displays are widely used not only for notebook-type personal computers and notebook-type word processors, but also for normal- and wide-screen television units.
      <br/>
      It is required to provide a display capable of displaying images of different sizes.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Namely, recent computers and video equipment provide fine, high-quality images, and displays such as LCDs are required to display such images and images of different sizes.</p>
    <p num="6">
      To display fine, high-quality images, a display, for example, a matrix LCD must have many pixels.
      <br/>
      A color image of 640 * 480 dots requires 640 * 480 * 3 (for red, green, and blue) pixels, and a color image of 1024 * 768 dots requires 1024 * 768 * 3 pixels.
      <br/>
      An LCD designed for 640 * 480-dot images is improper to display 1024 * 768-dot images, and an LCD designed for 1024 * 768-dot images is improper to display 640 * 480-dot images.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another requirement for LCDs is to display normal television images of 3:4 in aspect ratio as well as wide television images of 9:16 in aspect ratio.
      <br/>
      Further, improvements in multimedia technology ask one LCD to display images of various sizes.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The problems of the prior art will be explained later in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">An object of the present invention is to provide a display capable of properly displaying images of various sizes.</p>
    <p num="10">According to the present invention, there is provided a display comprising a display panel having a first aspect ratio, capable of displaying an image of a second aspect ratio whose width element is larger than that of the first aspect ratio; a gate driver for sequentially selecting gate lines of the display panel; a data driver for storing display data for one gate line and supplying the display data to one of the gate lines selected by the gate driver; and a timing controller for supplying control signals to the gate driver and the data driver so that predetermined data is displayed in top and bottom non-image areas of the display panel during a vertical blanking period.</p>
    <p num="11">
      A frequency of a clock signal used to sequentially select the gate lines may be increased during the vertical blanking period from a value for usual display data to a value for the predetermined data.
      <br/>
      A frequency of the clock signal for the predetermined data may be about two to four times higher than a frequency for usual display data.
      <br/>
      The timing controller may write the predetermined data simultaneously to the top and bottom non-image areas of the display panel during the vertical blanking period with the frequency of the clock signal being set to a low value.
      <br/>
      The timing controller may write the predetermined data to the data driver during the vertical blanking period in one latch operation.
      <br/>
      The first aspect ratio may be 3:4 corresponding to a normal-size image, and the second aspect ratio may be 9:16 corresponding to a wide-size image.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The display may further comprise an RGB driver for controlling red, green, and blue.
      <br/>
      The predetermined data may correspond to black.
      <br/>
      The display may be a liquid crystal display.
    </p>

    <p num="14">
      The first aspect ratio may be 9:16 corresponding to a wide-size image and the second aspect ratio may be 3:4 corresponding to a normal-size image.
      <br/>
      The timing controller may write the predetermined data simultaneously to the left and right non-image areas of the display panel during the horizontal blanking period with the frequency of the clock signal being set to a low value.
      <br/>
      The timing controller may write the predetermined data simultaneously to the right non-image area of a given gate line and the left non-image area of the next gate line during the horizontal blanking period.
      <br/>
      The display may be capable of inverting an image according to data start signals.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Further, according to the present invention, there is provided a display comprising a display panel having a matrix of pixels, capable of displaying an image including a smaller number of dots than the number of pixels of the display panel; a gate driver for sequentially selecting gate lines of the display panel; a data driver for storing display data for one gate line and supplying the stored display data to one of the gate lines selected by the gate driver; and a timing controller for supplying control signals to the gate driver and the data driver so that gate lines having no image data are driven at intervals of several gate lines during a horizontal period and so that different ones of the gate lines having no image data are driven from frame to frame so that all gate lines are driven in several frames.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The gate driver may comprise a first and a second gate drivers arranged on each side of the display panel, to alternately drive the gate lines.
      <br/>
      The timing controller may have a clock generator for generating clock pulses having different frequencies and a clock controller for generating select signals to select one of the clock pulses as a gate shifting clock signal.
      <br/>
      The timing controller may drive the gate lines having no image data at intervals of several gate lines according to the first clock pulse selected by the select signal and may skip the remaining gate lines that are not driven according to the second clock pulse selected by the select signal, the period of the second clock pulse being shorter than that of the first clock pulse.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The polarity of a drive signal applied to the gate lines having no image data may be alternated whenever all gate lines are driven.
      <br/>
      The display may further comprise an image signal controller for controlling display data.
      <br/>
      The predetermined data may correspond to black.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="29">For a better understanding of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the problem in the prior art will be explained with reference to FIGS. 1A to 2B.</p>
    <p num="30">
      FIGS. 1A and 1B show wide images displayed on a display such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) according to the prior art.
      <br/>
      The display is designed for normal-size images.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2A and 2B show methods of the prior art to display the images of FIGS. 1A and 1B.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The LCD of the prior art has a normal aspect ratio of 3:4.
      <br/>
      When a wide image having an aspect ratio of 9:16 is displayed on the LCD, the prior art cuts left and right areas of the image as shown in FIG. 1A, or top and bottom areas thereof as shown in FIG. 1B.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      To display the image of FIG. 1A, the method of FIG. 2A cuts left and right areas SA1 and SA2 of each line of the wide image and displays only an intermediate part of 3:4 in aspect ratio of the wide image.
      <br/>
      Namely, this method is unable to display the areas SA1 and SA2 of the wide image.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      On the other hand, the method of FIG. 2B cuts top and bottom areas SB1 and SB2 of the wide image and displays only an intermediate area of 3:4 in aspect ratio of the wide image.
      <br/>
      At this time, this method displays black in the areas SB1 and SB2.
    </p>
    <p num="34">In this way, the conventional LCD designed for normal images is unable to properly display wide images or images of various sizes.</p>
    <p num="35">Next, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained.</p>
    <p num="36">
      FIG. 3 shows a wide image displayed in its original aspect ratio on an LCD according to the first aspect of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The LCD has an LCD panel having n data lines and m gate lines (horizontal scan lines).
      <br/>
      The LCD displays, for example, black in top and bottom areas BB1 and BB2 where no image data is given.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      FIG. 4 is a block diagram showing an LCD according to an embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The LCD has an LCD panel 1, a data driver 2, a gate driver 3, an RGB driver (image signal processor) 4, and a timing controller (control signal generator) 5.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The LCD panel 1 has an aspect ratio of 3:4.
      <br/>
      The data driver 2 stores display data for one gate line.
      <br/>
      The gate driver 3 sequentially selects the gate lines of the panel 1, and data stored in the data driver 2 is supplied to the selected gate line, to display an image on the panel 1.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The timing controller 5 provides the gate driver 3 with a vertical start signal STV, a gate shifting clock signal  PHI X, and a gate output enable signal GOE.
      <br/>
      The timing controller 5 provides the data driver 2 with a data latch enable signal LE and a data output enable signal OED.
      <br/>
      Further, the timing controller 5 provides the RGB driver 4 with a black control signal BLK.
      <br/>
      The RGB driver 4 provides the data driver 2 with red (R), green (G), and blue (B) data signals.
    </p>
    <p num="40">FIG. 5 is a timing chart showing the operation of the gate driver 3 when displaying a normal image of 3:4 in aspect ratio on the panel 1.</p>
    <p num="41">After the start signal STV rises, the gate driver 3 sequentially selects a first gate line X1(OUT), a second gate line X2(OUT), a third gate line X3(OUT), and the like in response to each rise of the clock signal  PHI X. The data driver 2 writes display data to the selected gate line, thereby displaying an image on the panel 1.</p>
    <p num="42">FIG. 6 shows a method of controlling the LCD of FIG. 4 according to the first aspect of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="43">The first aspect displays, during a vertical blanking period, a specific color such as black in the areas BB1 and BB2 having no image data.</p>
    <p num="44">
      It is impossible to entirely display black in the areas BB1 and BB2 during a vertical blanking period at the driving frequency f Hz of the panel 1.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the first aspect multiplies the frequency f of the clock signal  PHI X supplied to the gate driver 3 during the vertical blanking period by k (f'=f * k).
      <br/>
      The constant k is, for example, 2 to 4 so that black is written to the areas BB1 and BB2 at the frequency f' that is faster than the driving frequency f of the panel 1.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      FIG. 7 is a block diagram showing the timing controller 5.
      <br/>
      The timing controller 5 has a PLL (phase locked loop) counter 51, a low-pass filter (LPF) 52, a voltage control oscillator (VCO) 53, a separator 54, a vertical timing pulse generator 55, and a horizontal timing pulse generator 56.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In response to a composite signal C-SYNC, the separator 54 supplies a vertical synchronizing signal V-SYNC to the vertical timing pulse generator 55.
      <br/>
      The composite signal C-SYNC is also supplied to the PLL counter 51.
      <br/>
      The output of the PLL counter 51 is fed back thereto through the low-pass filter 52 and voltage control oscillator 53, which provides a master clock signal CLK.
      <br/>
      The master clock signal CLK and the output of the PLL counter 51 are supplied to the vertical and horizontal timing pulse generators 55 and 56.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The vertical timing pulse generator 55 has a line counter 550, to provide the horizontal timing pulse generator 56 with a line number.
      <br/>
      The horizontal timing pulse generator 56 has a column counter, to provide the vertical timing pulse generator 55 with a column number.
      <br/>
      The vertical timing pulse generator 55 generates the vertical start signal STV, gate shifting clock signal  PHI X, and gate output enable signal GOE.
      <br/>
      The horizontal timing pulse generator 56 generates a horizontal start signal SIO, a data shifting clock signal CLKD, and the data output enable signal OED.

    <p num="48">
      FIG. 8 is a block diagram showing the gate driver 3 of the LCD of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The gate driver 3 has a shift register 31, an inverter 32, and AND gates 331 to 33m.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Each register unit of the shift register 31 receives the clock signal  PHI X. In addition, the first register unit receives the start signal STV.
      <br/>
      An input terminal of each of the AND gates 331 to 33m receives the output enable signal GOE through the inverter 32, and the other input terminal thereof receives the output of a corresponding one of the register units of the shift register 31.
      <br/>
      The signal GOE is set at low level, and therefore, the input terminal of each AND gate connected to the inverter 32 is at high level.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the outputs X1 to Xm of the AND gates 331 to 33m are equal to the outputs of the register units of the shift register 31.
      <br/>
      In response to the start signal STV, the gate outputs X1 to Xm are sequentially selected according to the clock signal  PHI X. The selected gate output is supplied to the gates of TFTs 20 connected to pixel electrodes 30 arranged along one gate line of the panel 1.
      <br/>
      Display data is written to the gate line in question.
      <br/>
      The present invention is applicable not only to active-matrix LCDs but also to other displays such as plasma display panels (PDPs).

      The circuits 22, 23, and 24 are arranged for each of red (R), green (G), and blue (B).
      <br/>
      The outputs of the shift register 21 controls the switching circuit 22.
      <br/>
      The latch enable signal LE controls the latch circuit 23, and the output enable signal OED controls the output circuit 24.
      <br/>
      The output of the output circuit 24 is connected to the source of a corresponding TFT 20 whose drain is connected to a corresponding pixel electrode 30. R, G, and B data for one gate line are written to pixels that are arranged along a gate line selected by the gate driver 3.

    <p num="52">FIG. 10 shows an example of the vertical timing pulse generator 55 of FIG. 7.</p>
    <p num="53">
      The vertical timing pulse generator 55 has two J-K flip-flops 551 and 552.

      J and K terminals of the flip-flop 551 receive X-line and X+1-line select signals, respectively, so that the flip-flop 551 may provide the vertical start signal STV.
      <br/>
      J and K terminals of the flip-flop 552 receive a 0-column and n/2-column select signals, respectively, so that the flip-flop 552 may provide the gate shifting clock signal  PHI X.

      If the frequency of the gate shifting clock signal  PHI X is unchanged at f Hz, black will not completely be displayed in the areas BB1 and BB2 during the vertical blanking period.
      <br/>
      To solve this problem, the present invention multiplies the frequency f Hz by k into f' Hz (f'=f * k).

      FIGS. 49 to 52 are timing charts showing the operation of the gate driver 603, according to a first embodiment of the fourth aspect of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The figures correspond to first to fourth frames, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      In the first frame of FIG. 49, last display data DDL for the last line of the first frame of the image DI is written to a gate line (horizontal scan line) OUT1 according to a pulse CK1 of a gate shifting clock signal  PHI X. Black is written to the next gate line OUT2, which is the first gate line in the bottom area of the panel 601 where the image DI is not present, in response to a pulse CK2 of the clock signal  PHI X. Black is written to every fourth gate line (OUT6, OUT10, . . . ) in response to each pulse CK2 of the clock signal  PHI X. Namely, the gate output enable signal GOE is set to high level in response to the pulses CK1 and CK2 of the clock signal  PHI X, to write black to every fourth gate line (OUT2, OUT6, . . . ).
      <br/>
      The remaining gate lines (OUT3 to OUT5, OUT7 to OUT9, . . . ) are skipped in response to pulses CK3 whose period is shorter than that of the pulse CK2, with the signal GOE being set to low level.

    <p num="141">
      In the second frame of FIG. 50, last display data DDL for the last line of the second frame of the image DI is written to the gate line OUT1 according to a pulse CK1 of the clock signal  PHI X. Black is written to the gate line OUT3, which is the second gate line in the bottom area of the panel 601 where the image DI is not present, in response to a pulse CK2 of the clock signal  PHI X. Black is written to every fourth gate line (OUT7, OUT11, . . . ) in response to pulses CK2 of the clock signal OX.
      <br/>
      Namely, the gate output enable signal GOE is set to high level in response to the pulses CK1 and CK2, to write black to every fourth gate line (OUT3, OUT7, . . . ).
      <br/>
      The remaining gate lines (OUT2, OUT4 to OUT6, . . . ) are skipped in response to pulses CK3 of the clock signal  PHI X, with the signal GOE being set to low level.
    </p>
    <p num="142">Similarly, in the third and fourth frames of FIGS. 51 and 52, black is written to the gate lines OUT4, OUT8, and the like where the image DI is not present according to the pulses CK2 of the clock signal  PHI X.</p>
    <p num="143">
      In this way, this embodiment drives a gate line per horizontal scan period (H-SYNC) when the data driver 602 provides image data.
      <br/>
      During a period in which there is no image data, the embodiment drives a gate line per a plurality of horizontal scan periods.
      <br/>
      Namely, during the period having no image data, the embodiment inserts four pulses in each horizontal scan period, to shift the shift register 631 of the gate driver 603 by four gate lines.
      <br/>
      At this time, the gate output enable signal GOE is provided only for one of the four gate lines, so that the selected one gate line receives data and the remaining three gate lines receive no data.
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      In this way, the embodiment writes black to every fourth gate line, to drive all gate lines in four frames.
      <br/>
      The pulse CK2 used to display black in each gate line having no image data is relatively long but shorter than the pulse CK1 used to display image data, and the pulse CK3 used to skip gate lines is shorter than the pulse CK2.
      <br/>
      As a result, black is correctly written in four frames to every gate line in the bottom area of the panel 601 where there is no image data.
      <br/>
      Similarly, black is written to the top area of the panel 601 where the image DI is not present.

      The pulses CK1 to CK3 from the clock generator 652 are switched from one to another according to select signals SEL1 to SEL3 provided by the clock controller 653 according to the timing of display data.

      A Q terminal of the flip-flop 6536 provides the select signal SELl.

      The polarity of display signals is inverted line by line during an image displaying period.

      Namely, in the first to fourth frames, the polarity of display signals is inverted line by line in each frame, and the polarity of the black signal during a blanking period is, for example, positive.
      <br/>
      In the fifth to eighth frames, the polarity of display signals is inverted line by line in each frame, and the polarity of the black signal during a blanking period is inverted to negative.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the polarity of display signals is inverted line by line and frame by frame.

      On the other hand, the polarity of the black signal is unchanged between lines and is inverted every four frames, to make the period thereof be eight frames.

      These figures correspond to first to fourth frames, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="157">The period of a pulse CK2' (CK1') of a gate shifting clock signal  PHI X of FIGS. 60 to 63 is longer than the period of the pulse CK2 (CK1) of FIGS. 49 to 52 because of the two gate drivers 731 and 732.</p>
    <p num="158">In the first frame of FIG. 60, last display data DDL for the first frame of an image DI displayed on an LCD panel 701 is written to gate lines (horizontal scan lines) OUT1-L and OUT1-R through the gate drivers 731 and 732 according to the pulse CK1' of the clock signal  PHI X. The period of the pulse CK1' is about twice longer than that of the pulse CK1 of FIGS. 49 to 52. Black is written to the next gate line OUT2-L according to the pulse CK2'. Black is also written to every fourth gate line (OUT4-L, OUT6-L, . . . ) according to each pulse CK2'.</p>

      <br/>
      The remaining gate lines (OUT2-R, OUT3-L, OUT3-R, OUT4-R, OUT5-L, OUT5-R, . . . ) are skipped by setting the signals GOE-L and GOE-R to low level according to each pulse CK3' whose period is shorter than that of the pulse CK2'. The pulse CK3' may be identical to the pulse CK3 of FIGS. 49 to 52.

      Similar to the embodiment of FIGS. 49 to 52, the embodiment of FIGS. 61 to 63 writes black to every fourth gate line, so that all gate lines are driven in four frames.
      <br/>
      Since the latter employs the two gate drivers 731 and 732 for alternately driving odd and even gate lines, the period of the pulse CK2' of the clock signal  PHI X of FIGS. 61 to 63 is about twice longer than that of the pulse CK2 of FIGS. 49 to 52.

      As explained above, the fourth aspect of the present invention drives one of several gate lines in a blanking period.
      <br/>
      Namely, the fourth aspect generates several kinds of clock pulses in each horizontal period, to enable one of a plurality of gate lines and skip the remaining gate lines, so that all gate lines are driven in a plurality of frames.
      <br/>
      The fourth aspect reduces the frequency of the gate output enable signal GOE, to extend the period of the gate shifting clock signal  PHI X. Since the width of a write pulse in a blanking period is wide, a sufficient write voltage is applied to liquid crystal cells.
      <br/>
      The fourth aspect may arrange gate drivers on each side of an LCD panel, to alternately drive gate lines (horizontal scan lines).
      <br/>
      This arrangement halves the frequency of the clock signal  PHI X, to further widen the width of a write pulse during a blanking period.
      <br/>
      When displaying an image in its original size on an LCD panel whose size is larger than that of the image, the fourth aspect provides a sufficient write time even if a blanking period is short or even if there are many gate lines having no image data, to write some data that may not spoil the view to pixels having no image data.
