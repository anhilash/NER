    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a silver halide emulsion having excellent high-illuminance reciprocity law failure characteristics, reduced in change of sensitivity and change of gradation due to changing in the time after exposure until processing and small in the reduction of sensitivity on exposure at a high humidity, a production process thereof and a silver halide color photographic light-sensitive material using the same.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In recent years, requirements for the capabilities of a color printing paper, such as high sensitivity, processing stability, high-quality image and rapid processability in the development processing step are increasing.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, as a result of recent popularization of laser scanning exposure apparatuses, suitability for short-time and high-illuminance exposure is one of the important capabilities.
      <br/>
      The laser scanning exposure is advantageous in that high-speed exposure is attained and the resolution is improved.
      <br/>
      However, for applying this to a color printing paper, suitability for unusually very short-time (specifically, 10-6 second) and high-illuminance exposure is required.
    </p>
    <p num="3">In order to improve the reciprocity law failure of the silver halide emulsion at such high-illuminance exposure, a method of doping a metal compound represented by iridium to the base grain is well known in the art.</p>
    <p num="4">The improvement of the reciprocity law failure of the silver halide emulsion by iridium is described, for example, in B. H. Carroll, Iridium Sensitization: A Literature Review of Photographic Science and Engineering, Vol. 24, No. 6 (1980), and R. S. Eachus, The Mechanism of Ir3+ Sensitization (International Meeting 1982 of Photographic Science).</p>
    <p num="5">
      On the other hand, it is also known that the silver halide emulsion having added thereto iridium has a very undesired characteristic such that the photographic capabilities (for example, sensitivity, gradation) change in the time passing after the exposure until the processing.
      <br/>
      This characteristic is described in H. Zwicky, On the Mechanism of the Sensitivity Increase With Iridium in Silver Halide Emulsions of The Journal of Photographic Science, Vol. 33, pp. 201-203 (1985).
      <br/>
      According to the methods hitherto proposed, the high-illuminance reciprocity law failure is surely improved but the sensitivity very greatly changes due to changing in the time after exposure until processing and the practical use is not expected at all.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A silver halide emulsion having a high silver chloride content has a purpose of rapid processing in the color development but is deficient in that high-sensitivity high-contrast gradation cannot be obtained by usual chemical sensitization.
      <br/>
      A large number of attempts have been made to achieve high sensitivity of a high silver chloride emulsion.
      <br/>
      Among those, a technique of forming a silver bromide-rich phase in the vicinity of the grain apex of a silver halide host grain to thereby achieve high sensitivity is disclosed in JP-A-64-26837 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application").
      <br/>
      Further, JP-A-5-61136 discloses a technique of forming a silver bromide-rich phase in the vicinity of the grain apex of a silver halide host grain through multiple stages.
      <br/>
      According to these techniques, however, the high-illuminance reciprocity law failure is not improved. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,284,745, 5,391,471, 5,415,991, 5,043,256 and 5,627,020 disclose a method of doping a metal compound represented by Ir to the inside of a silver bromide-rich phase of a high silver chloride base grain.
      <br/>
      Further, European Patent Publication 0568091A, U.S. Pat. No. 5,356,770 and JP-A-6-35147 disclose a method of adding a bromide to a high silver chloride grain simultaneously with or after the addition of iridium.
      <br/>
      According to these methods, the change of sensitivity due to changing in the time after exposure until processing is suppressed and the high-illuminance reciprocity law failure is improved, however, the effect is still not sufficient in the case of a high-illuminance exposure for a very short time, such as laser scanning exposure.
      <br/>
      In addition, reduction in the sensitivity occurred on exposure at a high humidity is not prevented.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a silver halide emulsion having excellent reciprocity law failure characteristics on short-time high-illuminance exposure, reduced in change of sensitivity due to changing in the time after exposure until processing and small in the reduction of sensitivity on exposure at a high humidity.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="20">The present invention is described in detail below.</p>
    <p num="21">
      The host silver halide grain for use in the preparation of the emulsion of the present invention is preferably a cubic or tetradecahedral crystal grain having substantially +100} faces (the grain may have rounded corners and may have a higher order face).
      <br/>
      Further, 50% or more of the entire projected area are preferably occupied by tabular crystal grains comprising a +100} face or +111} face and having an aspect ratio of 2 or more.
      <br/>
      The aspect ratio is a value obtained by dividing the diameter of a circle corresponding to the projected area of a grain by the thickness of the grain.
      <br/>
      As the aspect ratio is larger, the grain is smaller in the thickness and flatter.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the tabular grain means a grain having an aspect ratio of 1.2 or more and the average aspect ratio means an average of the aspect ratios of all tabular grains in the emulsion.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, a cubic tabular grain or a tabular grain having a +100} face as the major face is preferably used.
      <br/>
      The +100} tabular grain is more preferably a tabular grain having an adjacent major face edge length ratio of 10 or less.
      <br/>
      The adjacent major face edge length ratio as used herein means a value obtained by dividing the longer side out of two sides adjacent to each other by the shorter side.
      <br/>
      As the adjacent major face edge length ratio is closer to 1, the major face approximates to a square.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The tabular grain containing silver chloride in a high concentration includes a grain having +100} major faces and a grain having +111} major faces.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The tabular silver halide emulsion grain having +100} major faces is formed by the method of adding an aqueous silver salt solution and an aqueous halide salt solution to a dispersion medium such as an aqueous gelatin solution while stirring and mixing the resulting solution.
      <br/>
      At this time, silver iodide is allowed to be present in JP-A-6-301129 and JP-A-6-347929 or silver bromide is allowed to be present in JP-A-9-34045 to cause distortion in the nucleus due to the difference in the crystal lattice from silver chloride, thereby introducing screw dislocations.
      <br/>
      When screw dislocations are introduced, the formation of a dimensional nucleus on the face is not the rate determination any more and crystallization on this face proceeds.
      <br/>
      By introducing screw dislocations into two orthogonal +100} faces, a tabular grain is formed.
      <br/>
      Also, a method of forming a +100} tabular grain by adding a +100} face formation accelerator is disclosed in JP-A-6-347928 where an imidazole or a 3,5-diaminotriazole is used or in JP-A-8-339044 where a polyvinyl alcohol is used.
    </p>

      The silver bromide-rich phase can also be formed through the following process.
      <br/>
      Bromide ions or silver bromide fine particles are supplied to the above-descried host silver halide grains to precipitate a new silver halide phase more rich in silver bromide on the surface of the host silver halide grain.
      <br/>
      The process by the bromide ion proceeds by the exchange reaction with a halogen ion on the surface of the host silver halide grain, so-called "halogen conversion" process.
      <br/>
      Another process by the silver halide fine grain proceeds by the reaction called "recrystallization" of forming a crystal having a more stable composition between the host silver halide grain and the silver bromide fine grain, and belongs to a category different from the conversion reaction.
      <br/>
      In this recrystallization reaction, the driving force of the reaction is the increase in the entropy, and the reaction is quite different from the Ostwald ripening.

      This is described, for example, in H. C. Yutzy, Journal of American Chemical Society, p. 59916 (1937).
      <br/>
      Although these two kinds of reactions are quite different from each other, the vicinity of the host grain apex is surprisingly selected as the new phase more rich in silver bromide in either reaction but this is a well known phenomenon.

      The CR compound elevates the selectivity of the initial formation site of a new phase more rich in silver bromide than the host grain and additionally, the CR compound prevents such a reaction that the new phase initially formed repeatedly recrystallizes the surface of the host grain to render the entire surface of the host grain to be a homogeneous new phase, and accelerates the formation and maintenance of a "new phase more rich in silver bromide" epitaxially grown limitedly to the vicinity of the host grain apex.
      <br/>
      A method of mixing and ripening high silver bromide fine grains and host grains is advantageous in that the reaction proceeds highly uniformly and is easy to control.
      <br/>
      Further, this method is preferred because the silver bromide content of the new phase can be controlled over a wide range by the conditions such as silver bromide content or grain size of the high silver bromide fine grain used in the mixing and ripening, or pAg at the time of recrystallization reaction.
      <br/>
      In the silver halide grain formed by this method, a new phase more rich in silver bromide than the host grain is epitaxially grown in the vicinity of the apex of the host grain having a silver chloride content of 90 mol % or more and a region with gentile transition in the halogen composition may be formed between the new phase and the host grain.

    <p num="48">
      Further, the halogen compositions of the host grain and the new phase can be determined by the X-ray diffraction method.

      <br/>
      This measurement method is specifically described in Someno and Yasumorii, Hyomen Bunseki (Surface Analysis), Kodansha (1977).
      <br/>
      From the halogen compositions of the host grain and the new phase determined by the X-ray diffraction method and the surface average silver halide composition determined by XPS, the proportion of the new phase more rich in silver bromide than the host grain occupying the entire surface can be roughly estimated.
      <br/>
      For specifying the site where the new phase more rich in silver bromide than the host grain is present or for determining the occupation ratio of the phase in the vicinity of the apex of a grain, the EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis) method using an EDX spectrometer equipped with a transmission-type electron microscope may be used other than the above-described method by the observation through an electron microscope.

      The other silver halide for use in the color light-sensitive material of the present invention may be silver chloride, silver bromide, silver (iodo)chlorobromide or silver iodobromide, but in view of the rapid processing, a high silver chloride emulsion having a silver chloride content of 90 mol % or more, more preferably 95 mol % or more, still more preferably 98 mol % or more is preferred.
      <br/>
      Of these embodiments, an embodiment where three kinds of silver halide emulsion layers different in the hue all contain the silver halide emulsion prepared by the production process of the present invention is most preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="57">For the purpose of increasing the sharpness or the like of an image, the light-sensitive material of the present invention preferably contains a dye capable of decoloration by the processing (particularly, an oxonol-base dye) described in European Patent Publication 0337490A2, pp. 27-76, which is added to a hydrophilic colloid layer such that the light-sensitive material has an optical reflection density at 680 nm of 0.70 or more, or preferably contains 12 wt % or more (more preferably, 14 wt % or more) of titanium oxide surface-treated with a di-, tri- or tetrahydric alcohol (e.g., trimethylolethane), in a water-resistant resin layer of the support.</p>
    <p num="58">
      The photographic additives which can be used in the present invention, such as cyan, magenta and yellow couplers, are preferably dissolved in a high-boiling point organic solvent before use.
      <br/>
      The high boiling organic solvent is a water-immiscible compound having a melting point of 100 (degree)  C. or lower and a boiling point of 140 (degree)  C. or higher, and any may be used as long as it is a good solvent for the coupler.
      <br/>
      The high boiling point organic solvent preferably has a melting point of 80 (degree)  C. or lower, and preferably has a boiling point of 160 (degree)  C. or higher, more preferably 170 (degree)  C. or higher.
    </p>
    <p num="59">The high boiling point organic solvent is described in detail in JP-A-62-215272, from page 137, right lower column to page 144, right upper column.</p>
    <p num="60">The cyan, magenta or yellow coupler may be impregnated into a loadable latex polymer (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,203,716) in the presence or absence of the above-described high boiling point organic solvent or dissolved together with a water-insoluble and organic solvent-soluble polymer and then emulsion-dispersed in a hydrophilic colloid aqueous solution.</p>
    <p num="61">The homopolymers and copolymers described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,857,449, columns 7 to 15, and International Patent Publication WO88/00723, pages 12 to 30 are preferred, methacrylate-base or acrylamide-base polymers are more preferred, and acrylamide-base polymers are still more preferred in view of stabilization of a dye image.</p>
    <p num="62">
      The light-sensitive material of the present invention preferably uses a dye image preservability improving compound described in European Patent Publication 0277589A2 in combination with the coupler.
      <br/>
      For suppressing the latent image sensitization, the compound is particularly preferably used in combination with a pyrrolotriazole coupler and/or a pyrazoloazole coupler.
    </p>
    <p num="63">More specifically, Compound (F) which is chemically bonded with the aromatic amine-base developing agent remaining after color development to produce a chemically inactive and substantially colorless compound and/or Compound (G) which is chemically bonded with an oxidation product of the aromatic amine-base developing agent remaining after color development to produce a chemically inactive and substantially colorless compound, are preferably used simultaneously or individually, for example, for preventing staining or other side reactions due to a colored dye produced by the reaction of the color developing agent or oxidation product thereof remaining in the layer with a coupler during storage after the processing.</p>
    <p num="64">To the light-sensitive material of the present invention, an antifungal as described in JP-A-63-271247 is preferably added so as to prevent various molds and bacteria from proliferation in the hydrophilic colloid layer to deteriorate the image.</p>
    <p num="65">
      The support for use in the light-sensitive material of the present invention may be a white polyester-base support for display or a support having thereon a layer containing a white pigment in the side having a silver halide emulsion layer.
      <br/>
      Further, in order to improve the sharpness, an antihalation layer is preferably provided on the support in the side coated with a silver halide emulsion layer or on the back surface of the support.
      <br/>
      The support is preferably set to have a transmission density of from 0.35 to 0.8 so that the display can be viewed with either reflected light or transmitted light.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The light-sensitive material of the present invention may be exposed to visible light or infrared light.
      <br/>
      The exposure may be either low-illuminance exposure or high-illuminance short-time exposure.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, a laser scanning exposure method having an exposure time of less than 10-4 second per one pixel is preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      In the exposure, a band slip filter described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,726 is preferably used.
      <br/>
      By using this filter, light color mixing is eliminated and the color reproduction is remarkably improved.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The exposed light-sensitive material may be color-developed in a usual manner but in the case of a color light-sensitive material, it is preferably bleach-fixed after the color development for the purpose of rapid processing.
      <br/>
      When the above-described high silver chloride emulsion is used, the bleach-fixing solution preferably has a pH of about 6.5 or less, more preferably about 6 or less, so as to accelerate the desilvering.
    </p>
    <p num="69">Preferred examples of the silver halide emulsion, other materials (e.g., additives) and the photographic constituent layers (e.g., layer arrangement) which can be applied to the light-sensitive material of the present invention, and the processing method and additives for the processing which can be applied to the processing of the light-sensitive material include those described in the following patent publications, particularly, in European Patent Publication 0355660A2 (corresponding to JP-A-2-139544).</p>

    <p num="73">The present invention will be described below in greater detail by referring to the Examples but the present invention should not be construed as being limited thereto.</p>
    <p num="74">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="75">Preparation of Emulsion A</p>
    <p num="76">
      To a 3% aqueous solution of lime-processed gelatin, 3.5 g of sodium chloride was added and thereto 1.0 ml of N,N'-dimethylimidazolidine-2-thione (1% aqueous solution) was added.
      <br/>
      To the resulting aqueous solution, an aqueous solution containing 0.8 mol of silver nitrate and an aqueous solution containing 0.8 mol of sodium chloride were added and mixed at 50 (degree)  C. while vigorously stirring.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, an aqueous solution containing 0.20 mol of silver nitrate and an aqueous solution containing 0.20 mol of sodium chloride were added and mixed at 50 (degree)  C while vigorously stirring.
      <br/>
      At this time, 6.4 * 10-6 mol of yellow prussiate of potash was simultaneously added.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the mixed solution was water washed by sedimentation at 40 (degree)  C. to effect desalting.
      <br/>
      Thereto, 80.0 g of lime-processed gelatin was added and the emulsion was adjusted to have a pH and a pAg of 7.2 to 7.0, respectively.
      <br/>
      The resulting emulsion was passed through the bromine supplying process of adding 0.004 mol as silver of silver chlorobromide fine grain emulsion (halogen ratio: Br/Cl=60/40) having a grain size of 0.05  MU m at 60 (degree)  C. to form a silver bromide-rich phase on the surface of a silver chloride host grain.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, 1.1 * 10-4 mol/mol-Ag of a gold sensitizer (chloroauric acid), 2.7 * 10-6 mol/mol-Ag of a sulfur sensitizer (triethylthiourea), 1.4 * 10-5 mol/mol-Ag of red-sensitive spectral sensitizers (G and H) the same as in Example 2 and 2.6 * 10-3 mol of Compound I the same as in Example 2 were added to optimally perform chemical sensitization and spectral sensitization.
      <br/>
      Further, 7.7 * 10-4 mol/mol-Ag of 1-(5-methylureidophenyl)-5-mercaptotetrazole was added thereto.
      <br/>
      Into the silver chlorobromide fine grain emulsion, 1.7 * 10-4 mol/mol-Ag of potassium hexachloroiridate(IV) had been previously incorporated at the grain formation thereof (hereinafter, this fine grain emulsion was referred to as Fine Grain Emulsion a).
      <br/>
      From the electron microphotograph, the grain had a cubic shape, a grain size of 0.5  MU m and a coefficient of variation of 0.08. The grain size is expressed by the average of the diameters of circles equivalent to the projected areas of grains, and the grain size distribution used is a value obtained by dividing the grain size standard deviation by the average grain size.

    <p num="77">Preparation of Emulsion B</p>
    <p num="78">In the preparation of Emulsion A, the amount of potassium hexachloroiridate(IV) in the silver chlorobromide fine grain was changed to 3.4 * 10-4 mol/mol-Ag (hereinafter, this silver chlorobromide fine grain emulsion is referred to as Fine Grain Emulsion b).</p>
    <p num="79">Preparation of Emulsion C</p>
    <p num="80">In the preparation of Emulsion A, the amount of potassium hexachloroiridate(IV) in the silver chlorobromide fine grain was changed to 6.8 * 10-4 mol/mol-Ag (hereinafter, this silver chlorobromide fine grain emulsion is referred to as Fine Grain Emulsion c).</p>
    <p num="81">Preparation of Emulsion D</p>
    <p num="82">In the preparation of Emulsion A, only the bromine supplying process was changed and a method of adding 0.001 mol as silver of Fine Grain Emulsion a at 60 (degree)  C., ripening the for 5 minutes to form a silver bromide-rich phase in the vicinity of the apex of a silver chloride host grain, and further adding 0.003 mol as silver of Fine Grain Emulsion a under the same condition as above, was used.</p>
    <p num="83">Preparation of Emulsion E</p>
    <p num="84">In the preparation of Emulsion D, the silver chlorobromide fine grain emulsions added in the bromine supply process were changed such that potassium hexachloroiridate(IV) was not incorporated into the first time silver chlorobromide fine grain emulsion and the second time silver chlorobromide fine grain emulsion was added after incorporating 2.3 * 10-4 mol/mol-Ag of potassium hexachloroiridate(IV) during the grain formation thereof (hereinafter, the first time fine grain emulsion is referred to as Fine Grain Emulsion d and the second time fine grain emulsion is referred to as Fine Grain Emulsion e).</p>
    <p num="85">Preparation of Emulsion F</p>
    <p num="86">In the preparation of Emulsion D, the silver chlorobromide fine grain emulsions added in the bromine supply process were changed such that Fine Grain Emulsion c was added as the first time silver chlorobromide fine grain emulsion and Fine Grain Emulsion d not containing potassium hexachloroiridate(IV) was added as the second time silver chlorobromide fine grain emulsion.</p>
    <p num="87">Preparation of Emulsion G</p>
    <p num="88">In the preparation of Emulsion F, the halogen composition of the second time silver chlorobromide fine grain emulsion added in the bromine supplying process was changed to Br/Cl=30/70.</p>
    <p num="89">Preparation of Emulsion H</p>
    <p num="90">In the preparation of Emulsion A, the bromine supplying process was changed and a method of adding Aqueous Solution (I) shown below, ripening for 4 minutes to form a silver bromide-rich phase in the vicinity of the apex of a silver chloride host grain, adding 0.003 mol as silver of Fine Grain Emulsion d at 50 (degree)  C. and ripening the emulsion for 12 minutes, was used.</p>
    <p num="91">Aqueous Solution (I)</p>
    <p num="92">KBr (0.5 mol/l aqueous solution) 6.0 ml</p>
    <p num="93">Preparation of Emulsion I</p>
    <p num="94">In the preparation of Emulsion H, 1 * 10-4 mol of an aqueous potassium hexachloroiridate(IV) solution was added at once 1 minute after the addition of Fine Grain Emulsion d during the bromine supplying process.</p>
    <p num="95">Preparation of Emulsion J</p>
    <p num="96">In the preparation of Emulsion H, 1 * 10-4 mol of an aqueous potassium hexachloroiridate(IV) solution was added at once immediately before the addition of Aqueous Solution (I) during the bromine supplying process.</p>
    <p num="97">Preparation of Emulsion K</p>
    <p num="98">In the preparation of Emulsion J, Aqueous Solution (I) was changed to.Aqueous Solution (II) shown below.</p>

    <p num="100">S-3 (0.5 mol/l aqueous solution) 6.0 ml</p>
    <p num="101">Preparation of Emulsion L</p>
    <p num="102">In the preparation of Emulsion F, CR-7 (3.0 * 10-4 mol per 1.0 mol of silver halide) was added before the bromine supplying process.</p>
    <p num="103">
      Each of the emulsions prepared above was sampled at respective stages of the bromine supplying process and the ratio of the amount of unreacted Br immediately after the first time bromine supplying to the amount of unreacted Br immediately before the second time bromine supplying was examined.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is found that in any of Emulsions D to L, the second time bromine supply was effected after 90% or more of the first time formation of the silver bromide-rich phase was completed.
      <br/>
      Further, Emulsions D to F each was subjected to the atomic absorption spectrochemical analysis using the emulsions immediately before and after completion of the second time bromine supply, as a result, the iridium atom was found to be less than the limit of detection in either emulsion.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      Then, 25.0 ml of ethyl acetate and 4.2 g of Solvent (solv-6) were added to 9.6 g of Cyan Coupler (ExC-1), 0.6 g of Dye Image Stabilizer (Cpd-9), 5.4 g of Dye Image Stabilizer (Cpd-20), 12 g of Dye Image Stabilizer (Cpd-1), 1.5 g of Dye Image.Stabilizer (Cpd-12) and 0.4 g of Dye Image Stabilizer (Cpd-19), and the mixture was dissolved.
      <br/>
      The resulting solution was emulsion-dispersed in 402 ml of a 10% aqueous gelatin solution containing 20.0 ml of a 10% sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate to prepare Emulsion Dispersion A.

      After the processing, each sample was measured on the color density and the sensitivity and gradation were determined.
      <br/>
      The sensitivity is designated by the reciprocal of the exposure amount necessary for giving a color density 1.0 higher than the minimum color density and shown as a relative value by taking the sensitivity at the time when Sample 101 was exposed for 10 seconds and after 2 hours, subjected to development processing or when Sample 101 was exposed for 10-6 second and after 2 hours, subjected to development processing, as 100.
      <br/>
      The change in gradation due to the high illuminance law failure is outstanding particularly in the shoulder part and accordingly, the gradation is shown by the difference between the logarithm of the exposure amount necessary for giving a color density of 1.5 and the logarithm of the exposure amount necessary for giving a color density of 2 0 (slashed zero)  The smaller the value, the higher the contract.

      It is seen from these Tables that as in Emulsion A to C, by merely increasing the amount of iridium in the silver bromide-rich phase, the high illuminance law failure may be slightly reduced (see, Table 7) but change in the sensitivity due to the time after exposure until processing is great (see, Table 8).
      <br/>
      However, as in Emulsion F, when iridium is closed inside the silver bromide-rich phase, the high illuminance law failure is remarkably improved (see, Table 7) while successfully suppressing the change in sensitivity due to the time after exposure until processing.
      <br/>
      In particular, the effect is great in Emulsion L where the silver bromide-rich phase is formed in the presence of CR-7.
