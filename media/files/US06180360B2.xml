    <p num="5">
      The first step in the biosynthesis of penicillin involves the formation of the tripeptide  DELTA -(L- ALPHA -aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV) from L- ALPHA -aminoadipic acid, L-cysteine and L-valine (Fawcett et al., Biochem. J., 157, p. 651-660, 1976).
      <br/>
      The reaction is catalyzed by a multifunctional enzyme  DELTA -(L- ALPHA -aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase (ACV synthetase) with ATP and Mg2+ as co-factors (Banko et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 109, p. 2858-2860, 1987).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      ACV synthetase (ACVS) has been purified from Aspergillus nidulans (Van Liempt et al., J. Biol. Chem., 264, p. 3680-3684, 1989), Cephalosporium acremonium (Baldwin et al., J. Antibiot., 43, p. 1055-1057, 1990) and Streptomyces clavuligerus (Jensen et al., J. Bacteriol., 172, p. 7269-7271, 1990, and Zhang et al., Biotechnol.
      <br/>
      Lett., 12, p. 649-654, 1990).
      <br/>
      The purification of ACV synthetase from Penicillium chrysogenum has not been published.
      <br/>
      However, ACV synthetase from P. chrysogenum has been cloned by Diez et al. (J. Biol. Chem., 265, p. 16358-16365, 1990).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The linear tripeptide, ACV, is converted to isopenicillin N (IPN) in the presence of isopenicillin N synthase (also referred to as cyclase or isopenicillin N synthetase (IPNS)), ferrous ions, oxygen and an electron donor (lag ascorbate).
      <br/>
      Isopenicillin N synthase was first isolated from P. chrysogenum by Ramos et al. (Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 27, p. 380-387, 1985) and the isopenicillin N synthase structural gene from P. chrysogenum cloned by Carr et al. (Gene, 48, p. 257-266, 1986).
    </p>
    <p num="8">These first two steps in the biosynthesis of penicillins are common in penicillin and cephalosporin producing fungi and bacteria.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In some fungi, for example in P. chrysogenum and in A. nidulans, the  ALPHA -aminoadipyl side chain of isopenicillin N can be replaced by other side chains of intracellular origin or exogenously supplied.
      <br/>
      The exchange is catalyzed by an acyltransferase (referred to as acyl-coenzyme A: isopenicillin N acyltransferase or acyl-coenzyme A:6-aminopenicillanic acid acyltransferase).
      <br/>
      It is still unclear whether this conversion proceeds in vivo by a two-step reaction in which first the L- ALPHA -aminoadipyl side chain is removed to yield 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) followed by the acylation step, or the conversion is a direct exchange of the side chains.
      <br/>
      Purified acyltransferase from P. chrysogenum has both an isopenicillin N-amidohydrolase activity and an acyl-coenzyme A:6-aminopenicillanic acid acyltransferase activity Alvarez et al.
      <br/>
      Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 31, p. 1675-1682, 1987).
    </p>
    <p num="10">The genes coding for ACV synthetase (pcbAB), isopenicillin N synthase (pcbC) and acyl-coenzyme A:6-aminopenicillanic acid acyltransferase (penDE) are found in the same cluster in P. chrysogenum and A. nidulans (Diez et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265, p. 16358-16365, 1990, and Smith et al., Bio/Technology, a, p. 39-41, 1990).</p>
    <p num="11">
      Amplification of the pcbC-penDE gene cluster of P. chrysogenum Wis 54-1255, coding for isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) and acyltransferase (AT), respectively, led to as much as a 40% improvement in production yields (Veenstra et al., J. Biotechnol., 17, p. 81-90, 1991).
      <br/>
      Increased antibiotic yields were also reported in A. nidulans transformants containing multiple copies of pcbAB (coding for ACV synthetase (ACVS)) and pcbC genes (coding for isopenicillin N synthetase (INPS)) (McCabe et al., J. Biotechnol., 17, p. 91-97, 1991).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      EP 200425 (Eli Lilly) discloses vectors encoding isopenicillin N synthetase (IPNS).
      <br/>
      The vectors permit high level expression of IPNS in C. acremonium and E. coli.
      <br/>
      According to the disclosure the Cephalosporium vectors are useful for strain improvement, to increase efficiency and yield in fermentations for the production of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics.
      <br/>
      The vectors may also be modified to give vectors for increasing the production yields and efficiency of P. chrysogenum, Streptomyces clavuligerus etc. in fermentations.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      EP 357119 (Gist Brocades) discloses the clustered antibiotic biosynthetic genes encoding IPNS, AT and ACVS and are advantageously employed for improvement of production of the antibiotic in microorganisms and for the isolation of other genes involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic.
      <br/>
      The invention is exemplified with improved production of penicillin in P. chrysogenum, with the isolation of another clustered biosynthetic gene(s) and with the expression of clustered penicillin biosynthetic genes in Acremonium chrysogenum.

    <p num="14">Activation of side chain</p>
    <p num="15">
      In order to replace the  ALPHA -aminoadipic acid side chain in the acyltransferase catalyzed reaction, the carboxylic acid group of the new side chain has to be activated.
      <br/>
      This activation is one of the least well understood parts of the biosynthesis of penicillins.
      <br/>
      Two theories have been proposed.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The most widely accepted theory is that the enzyme catalyses the esterification of carboxylic acids into coenzyme A thioesters by a two-step mechanism that proceeds through the pyrophosphorolysis of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), in the presence of Mg2+. Firstly, the carboxylic acid (the new side chain), ATP and the enzyme forms a complex, leading to an acyl-AMP-enzyme complex.
      <br/>
      Secondly, this complex reacts with coenzyme A to liberate acyl-coenzyme A and AMP (adenosine monophosphate).
    </p>
    <p num="17">The other theory is based on the formation of an acyl-S-glutathione intermediate, which may be transformed to the corresponding acyl-coenzyme A ester (Ferrero et al., J. Antibiot., 43, p. 684-91, 1990.</p>
    <p num="18">
      A phenacyl:coenzyme A ligase from P. chrysogenum able to catalyze the synthesis of phenoxyacetyl-coenzyme A and phenylacetyl-coenzyme A in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, coenzyme A and phenoxy-acetic acid or phenylacetic acid has been described by Brunner, Rohr and Zinner (Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem., 349, p. 95-103, 1968), Brunner and Rohr (Methods Enzymol., 43, p. 476-481, 1975; Kogekar and Deshpande, Ind. J. Biochem. Biophys., 19, p. 257-261, 1982, and by Kurzatkowski, Med.
      <br/>
      Dosw. Mikrobiol., 33, p. 15-29, 1981).
      <br/>
      According to Brunner et al., the ligase shows similar degrees of activity towards phenylacetic acid, phenoxyacetic acid and acetic acid.
      <br/>
      However, the enzyme was never purified to homogeneity.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Martinez-Blanco et al. (J. Biol. Chem., 267, p. 5474-5481, 1992) have described an acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase from P. chrysogenum Wis 54-1255 which not only accepts acetic acid but also phenylacetic acid as substrates in the synthesis of the corresponding acyl-coenzyme A esters just like the ligase described by Brunner et al.
      <br/>
      However, the activity towards phenoxyacetic acid is not described by Martinez-Blanco et al.
      <br/>
      According to Martinez-Blanco et al., the acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase is a homo-dimer ( ALPHA 2) having a molecular weight of 139,000 Dalton as determined by gel filtration and of 70,000 Dalton as determined by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and an isoelectric point: between pH 5.6 and 6 0 (slashed zero)
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The gene coding for the acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase of Martinez-Blanco et al. has been characterized by Martinez-Blanco et al. (Gene, 130, p. 265-270, 1993).
      <br/>
      The gene which was designated acuA contains five introns and codes for a polypeptide of 669 amino acids.
      <br/>
      This polypeptide has a molecular weight of 74,287.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Gouka et al. (Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 38, p. 514-519, 1993) and Van Hartingsveldt et al. (WO 92/07079) have described the isolation and sequence of an acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (facA) gene from P. chrysogenum coding for a protein of 669 amino acids corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 74,000 Dalton (using an average molecular weight of 110 g/mol for each amino acid).
      <br/>
      The gene sequences of the facA gene of Gouka et al. and of acuA of Martinez-Blanco et al. showed no differences.
    </p>
    <p num="22">A detailed characterization of the phenylacyl-coenzyme A ligases described by Brunner et al. and by Kogekar and Deshpande has not been published.</p>
    <p num="23">
      In its activated form, the new side chain which is to replace the  ALPHA -aminoadipic acid side chain in the acyl transferase catalyzed reaction may be in the form of a coenzyme A thioester or another thioester, since other thioesters (e.g. acyl-S-cysteinyl-glycine and acyl-S-glutathione) have been reported to be substrates for the acyltransferase.
      <br/>
      As a further possibility, the dipeptide (cysteinyl-glycine) may be substituted by CoASH in a non-enzymatic reaction before it enters into the acyltransferase reaction (Ferrero et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265, p. 7084-7090, 1990).
    </p>
    <p num="24">Once it is formed, the thionylgroup of the thioesters may exchange rapidly with other thiols (e.g. mercaptoethanol, 1,4-dithithreitol, ACV and coenzyme A) in a non-enzymatic reaction.</p>
    <p num="25">Ligases in general</p>
    <p num="26">Ligases, belonging to the enzyme subclass 6.2.1., Acid-Thiol ligases (enzyme Nomenclature, Academic Press, inc., 1992) also referred to as acyl-coenzyme A synthetases or acyl-coenzyme A thiokinases, catalyze the formation of acyl-coenzyme A thioesters from a carboxylic acid and coenzyme A in the presence of ATP and Mg2+.</p>
    <p num="27">
      Several ligases or acyl-coenzyme A synthetases from various sources have been identified e.g. acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase, propionyl-coenzyme A synthetase (Groot, Biochim.
      <br/>
      Biophys. Acta, 441, p. 260-267, 1976); butyryl-coenzyme A synthetase (Wanders et al., J. Biol. Chem., 240, p. 29-33, 1965); medium-chain, long-chain and very long-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A synthetases (Waku, Biochim.
      <br/>
      Biophys. Acta, 1124, p. 101-111, 1992, review); benzoyl-coenzyme A ligase from Pseudomonas sp (Auburger, Appl.
      <br/>
      Microbiol. Biotechnol., 37, p. 789-795, 1992) and phenylacetyl-coenzyme A ligases (Martinez-Blanco et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265, p. 7084-7090, 1990; and Vitovski (FEMS Microbiol.
      <br/>
      Letters, 108, p. 1-6, 1993).
      <br/>
      Most of them have broad substrate specificities.
    </p>
    <p num="28">The acyl-coenzyme A synthetases (ligases) are generally key enzymes in the primary metabolism of fatty acids and acetic acid and in the initial steps in the degradation of aromatic acids where they through the formation of the energy-rich thioester bond activate the acyl group of the carboxylic acid.</p>
    <p num="29">In vivo production of  BETA -lactams</p>
    <p num="30">Many of the so called natural  BETA -lactams (e.g. penicillin DF, isopenicillin N, 6-APA, cephalosporin C etc.) are unstable, difficult to purify from the fermentation broth, have only limited antibiotic effect, and/or are produced in low yield.</p>
    <p num="31">Replacing the side chains of the natural  BETA -lactams with e.g. phenoxyacetic acid or phenylacetic acid leads to the formation of penicillins (penicillin V and penicillin G, respectively), which are more stable, easier to isolate and having a higher antibiotic activity.</p>
    <p num="32">
      The only directly fermented penicillins of industrial interest are penicillin V and penicillin G, produced by adding phenoxyacetic acid or phenyllactic acid, respectively to the fermentation tank.
      <br/>
      Addition of alternative precursors, for example 2-thiopheneacetic acid or 3-thiopheneacetic acid, during the fermentation of P. chrysogenum leads to other penicillins.
      <br/>
      Some added precursors e.g. 1-phenyl-n-alkanes or 1-phenoxy-n-alkanes may be partly metabolized within the P. chrysogenum cells before being used a substrate for the acyltransferase in the production of penicillins (Szarka, Advances in Biotechnology, 3, p. 167-173, 1980; Szarka et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,250,258; and Szarka et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,208,481).
      <br/>
      In the biosynthesis of the so-called natural penicillins: e.g. penicillin DF, penicillin K, penicillin F and penicillin H; the side chains: hexanoic acid, octanoic acid, 3-hexenoic acid, and heptanoic acid, respectively, are presumably derived from the primary metabolism.
    </p>
    <p num="33">In some cases the phenoxyacetyl or the phenylacetyl side chain also acts as a protection group during the fermentation and recovery of the  BETA -lactam, as the isolated penicillin V or G are hydrolysed by an organic chemical or enzymatic process to form 6-APA, which, in turn is the basic building block for new semi-synthetic penicillins having improved pharmacological properties compared to the natural penicillins as-well as the penicillin V or G.</p>
    <p num="34">
      Likewise in the production of cephalosporins, the natural cephalosporins are of limited pharmaceutical value, as they too are difficult to isolate and have only a low antibiotic effect.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, they are difficult to transform into new cephalosporins of higher pharmaceutical value.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      A number of steps have to be carried out, in order to transform the fermented cephalosporin into the desired antibiotic. e.g. in the production of the oral cephalosporins cephalexin and cefadroxil, the starting point is penicillin V or G, which is then transformed into a cephalosporin by a series of chemical reactions, keeping the phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl side chain as a protection group.
      <br/>
      After the ring expansion V-DCA or G-DCA (V/G-deacetoxycephalosporanic acid), respectively, is formed, the side-chain is removed by hydrolysis in a process similar to the hydrolysis of penicillin V or G. Finally, a new sidechain (e.g. D-phenylglycine or D-p-hydroxy-phenylglycine) is added by an organic chemical process.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In the production of cephalosporins from cephalosporin C, the D- ALPHA -aminoadipic acid may be removed either by chemical hydrolysis or by a two step organic chemical enzymatic process.
      <br/>
      The resulting 7-ACA (7-amino cephalosporanic acid) is then acylated to form the desired product.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Both the reactions leading to the formation of V-DCA, G-DCA and the hydrolysis of cephalosporin C to 7-ACA are carried out in industrial scale but they are difficult to control, expensive and yields generally are low.</p>
    <p num="38">
      In order to circumvent this problem, several alternatives have been suggested some of which involves the transformation of P. chrysogenum with the epimerase and expandase from e.g. Streptomyces, as described by C. Cantwell et al., 248, p. 283-289, 1992.
      <br/>
      They demonstrated the transformed P. chrysogenum was able to produce deacetoxycephalosporanic acid.
      <br/>
      However, no V-DCA was found.
      <br/>
      Cantwell suggested the expandase may be modified by genetic engineering in order to change its substrate specificity to accept penicillin V or G as substrate.
      <br/>
      Then the V/G-DCA may be produced directly by fermentation.
    </p>
    <p num="39">S. Gutierrez et al., Mol. Gen. Genet., 225, p. 56-64, 1991, transformed C. acremonium with the acyltransferase from P. chrysogenum, and were able to detect penicillin G formation by the transformed C. acremonium, but the presence of G-DCA was not proved.</p>
    <p num="40">
      EP 532341 (Merck &amp; Co, Inc.) describes the fermentation of adipoyl-7-ADCA (adipoyl-7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid) in P. chrysogenum transformed with the expandase from Streptomyces clavuligerus.
      <br/>
      The adipoyl-7-ADCA can then be extracted from the fermentation broth and hydrolysed by an adipoyl acylase from e.g. Pseudomonas.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="53">As the production economy is an important factor in the production of  BETA -lactams, improved processes leading to an increased fermentation yield, processes which are easier to control and being less cumbersome, and consequently less expensive, are needed.</p>
    <p num="54">It is the object of the invention to provide such improved processes for producing  BETA -lactam antibiotics.</p>
    <p num="55">It has now surprisingly been found that such improved processes can be provided if the production of  BETA -lactam antibiotics of interest takes place in the presence of increased ligase activity.</p>
    <p num="56">According to the invention, such improved process of producing a  BETA -lactam antibiotic, comprises</p>
    <p num="57">i) fermentation of a microorganism capable of producing said  BETA -lactam antibiotic, and</p>
    <p num="58">ii) recovering said  BETA -lactam antibiotic in substantially pure form, wherein said fermentation takes place in the presence of increased ligase activity, in comparison to the ligase activity present when fermenting with the original microorganism alone under the original fermenting conditions.</p>
    <p num="59">An increased ligase activity is defined as an enhanced conversion of the carboxylic acid in question towards the corresponding acyl-coenzyme A ester, in comparison to the unmodified original microorganism and/or the original fermentation conditions.</p>
    <p num="60">In an embodiment of the invention said original microorganism, capable of producing  BETA -lactams, lacks or has only low ligase activity.</p>
    <p num="61">The increased expression of ligase activity may be accomplished by any suitable way.</p>
    <p num="62">
      As an example, according to an embodiment of the invention, the ligase activity may be increased by modulation of the physical conditions of the fermentation process, such as temperature and pH.
      <br/>
      Another possibility is subjecting the microorganism to compounds or agents, leading to an increased expression of ligase.
      <br/>
      The nature of said compound or agent depends on e.g. the promoter used for initiating the expression of the ligase.
      <br/>
      Further, by interfering with the cellular control mechanisms controlling the ligase expression increased expression of ligase activity can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="63">In an embodiment of the invention said ligase activity or increased ligase activity is obtained by modifying said microorganism.</p>
    <p num="64">This can be done by well known procedures, such as introducing at least one copy of a DNA construct or a recombinant vector, comprising a gene encoding an enzyme exhibiting ligase activity, into said original microorganism to be fermented.</p>
    <p num="65">In an embodiment the ligase activity or increased ligase activity is obtained by random or site specific mutagenesis of said microorganism.</p>
    <p num="66">Furthermore, said modification, leading to increased ligase activity, may be obtained by amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions of the ligase enzyme, as described below.</p>
    <p num="67">Alternatively said ligase activity or increased ligase activity is obtained by adding enzyme exhibiting ligase activity during the production of the  BETA -lactam antibiotic.</p>
    <p num="68">In an alternative embodiment said DNA construct is derived from a species different from the microorganism in which it is to be introduced.</p>
    <p num="69">The introduction of the DNA construct or transformation vehicle may the performed by well known methods as described below.</p>
    <p num="70">
      In certain cases it is desirable to move the entire biosynthesis of a  BETA -lactam, including the expression of the enzyme exhibiting the ligase activity to another microorganism, which is not itself capable of producing said  BETA -lactam.
      <br/>
      This may be the case if the recipient (host) microorganism e.g. 1) is easier transformed, 2) is able to express the biosynthetic enzymes at high levels 3) has better growth characteristics or 4) produce less impurities, which may interfere with the recovery.
      <br/>
      Thus, a higher overall yield of the  BETA -lactam may be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="71">Alternatively new biosynthetic routes may be desirable in an organism.</p>
    <p num="72">According to the invention the above mentioned recipient or host microorganism is from the group comprising Penicillium, Cephalosporium, Aspergillus, Nocardia, Streptomyces, Bacillus, Cerospora, Microspora, other Eubacteria, other Actinomycetes or filamentous fungi.</p>
    <p num="73">In a preferred embodiment said microorganism belongs to the species from the group comprising Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium notatum, Cephalosporium acremonium, Aspergillus nidulans, Nocardia lactamdurans and Streptomyces clavuligerus.</p>
    <p num="74">
      In an embodiment of the invention the expression of said ligase activity is synchronized to the expression of other genes belonging to the  BETA -lactam biosynthetic pathway.
      <br/>
      Said genes may e.g. be the pcbAB, pcbC and/or penDE genes.

    <p num="75">The above mentioned  BETA -lactam antibiotic is from the group comprising penicillins, cephalosporins, cephamycins, mono-bactams, and nocardicins.</p>
    <p num="76">Preferably said antibiotic is a cephalosporin or a penicillin, such as penicillin V, penicillin G, V-DCA, G-DCA,  DELTA -(L- ALPHA -5-amino-5-carboxyvaleramido)-cephalosporanic acid (isocephalosporin C), adipoyl-7-ADCA, or adipoyl-7-ACA.</p>
    <p num="77">In an embodiment of the invention the culturing of said microorganism takes place under conditions inducing expression of said DNA sequence resulting in the production of the activated side chain coenzyme A thioester, which, in turn in the presence of an acyltransferase (AT) leads to the formation of a  BETA -lactam containing the said side chain.</p>
    <p num="78">The culturing of said modified microorganism preferably takes place under conditions inducing the expression of said DNA construct or recombinant vector, thus resulting in an increased production of the coenzyme A thioester of the acid corresponding to the side chain in the desired  BETA -lactam antibiotic, which, in turn, enables an increased flux through the step of the biosynthesis of the  BETA -lactam in which the  BETA -lactam side chain is introduced in the  BETA -lactam nucleus.</p>
    <p num="79">Further the culturing of the microorganism may also take place under conditions, dependent on the promoter, inducing expression of said ligase.</p>
    <p num="80">In the specific case of producing penicillin V or penicillin G, increasing the activity of ligase by e.g. genetic engineering will lead to an increased metabolic flow through the last step in the biosynthesis.</p>
    <p num="81">The advantages of the improved processes, according to the invention, is firstly, a process, according to the invention, which may result in a significantly elevated accumulated yield of the  BETA -lactam antibiotic of interest.</p>
    <p num="82">Secondly, due to formation of less waste product(s), the recovery and purification of  BETA -lactam antibiotics, in substantially pure form, is facilitated.</p>
    <p num="83">
      Thirdly, the invention permits the production of the  BETA -lactam antibiotics of interest, without the production of a significant amount of waste products.
      <br/>
      Consequently this makes the processes more efficient, due to more energy available to synthesize the products of interest.
      <br/>
      Further the waste-products may interfere adversely with the biosynthetic pathway.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Fourthly, the yield of the  BETA -lactam antibiotic of interest is, at any time in the fermentation process, significantly elevated in comparison to fermentation processes with microorganisms lacking or having low activity of said ligase.
      <br/>
      In this context the yield may be an overall yield or the yield over a certain period of time.
    </p>
    <p num="85">All the above mentioned advantages make the processes of producing industrial important  BETA -lactam antibiotics less expensive.</p>
    <p num="86">In the cases of producing penicillin V and penicillin G, where an accumulation of ACV and isopenicillin N is observed during the fermentation, an increase of the ligase activity, according to the invention, will lead to a decrease of the accumulation of said intermediate metabolites, when the conversion of isopenicillin N to penicillin V is a "bottle neck".</p>
    <p num="87">The expression of ligase activity or just an increase of said ligase activity, in microorganisms lacking or having low ligase activity, according to the invention, can make non-enzymatic removal of side-chains of  BETA -lactam antibiotic intermediates superfluous in the production of e.g. penicillins and cephalosporins.</p>
    <p num="88">Further, the recovery and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of the fermented  BETA -lactams can be facilitated if the side chains of the so called natural  BETA -lactams are replaced by hydrophobic side chains, such as phenoxyacetic acid or phenylacetic acid, which are easily removable by enzymatic hydrolysis using penicillin V acylases or penicillin G acylases, which are well known in the  BETA -lactam industry in the production of 6-APA.</p>
    <p num="89">Consequently this opens the possibility of producing certain industrial important  BETA -lactam antibiotic intermediates in vivo, such as V-DCA and G-DCA.</p>
    <p num="90">According to the invention it has been found that it is possible to produce certain  BETA -lactam antibiotics using entirely enzymatically catalyzed processes, consequently without any use of chemical processes.</p>
    <p num="91">
      In an embodiment of the invention V-DCA or G-DCA is produced entirely, by enzymatic means in vivo, by inducing the host microorganism to express an increased ligase activity, according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Further present is an acyltransferase (AT) (e.g. the acyl-coenzyme A:isopenicillin N acyltransferase from P. chrysogenum) and enzymes able to transform penicillins into cephalosporins (e.g. expandase from S. clavuligerus).
    </p>
    <p num="92">The invention also relates to a novel enzyme which may be used according to the invention.</p>
    <p num="93">Recently a suitable novel enzyme, exhibiting ligase activity, has been obtained and characterized.</p>
    <p num="94">This novel enzyme, according to the invention is an acyl-coenzyme A synthetase (ligase) and lead to an increased flow towards the product of interest, when producing  BETA -lactam antibiotics.</p>
    <p num="95">A characteristic of the enzyme, according to the invention, is that it has a high specificity towards certain important industrial  BETA -lactam antibiotic precursors.</p>
    <p num="96">
      As the ligase of this invention has no apparent activity towards acetic acid, an increased expression of the ligase activity is not likely to interfere with the intracellular availability of the acetyl-coenzyme A, one of the key metabolites in the primary metabolism.
      <br/>
      Thus, the risk of interfering adversely with the primary metabolism is reduced compared to manipulations (e.g. genetically or chemically), leading to increased expression of ligase having both activity towards acetic acid and phenylacetic acid and/or phenoxyacetic acid and/or adipic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="97">More specifically the novel enzyme, according to the invention, is at least between 10 and 100 times, preferably 103 times and more preferred up to between 104 and 105 times more active towards phenoxyacetic acid than towards acetic acid.</p>
    <p num="98">Further, the enzyme, according to the invention, has a substrate specificity of at least between 10 and 100 times, preferably 103 times and more preferred up to between 104 and 105 times more active towards phenylacetic acid than towards acetic acid.</p>
    <p num="99">The enzyme of the invention is as mentioned above an acyl-coenzyme A synthetase, more specifically a phenoxyacetyl-coenzyme A synthetase and will in the following be referred to as "ligase".</p>
    <p num="100">The apparent molecular weight of a catalytic active form of the ligase is in the range of between 40,000 and 60,000 Dalton, specifically about 50,000 Dalton, as determined by gel filtration.</p>
    <p num="101">The ligase has an apparent activity optimum in the range of pH 7.0 to 9.0, in particular in the range of pH 8.0 to 8.5. In vitro the enzyme exhibits only low activity at pH 7 or below, probably due to the low stability of the ligase when kept at pH below 7.5.</p>
    <p num="102">The optimum temperature for ligase activity is between 35 (degree)  C. and 45 (degree)  C. with the highest activity at about 40 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="103">The isoelectric point (pI) of the ligase appears to be higher than pH 7.25, more likely above pH 9, and below up to about pH 12.</p>
    <p num="104">
      The enzyme can be purified from cell extracts of P. chrysogenum by precipitation by ammonium sulphate and by elution from columns packed with various gels (e.g. Phenylsepharose, Cibacron blue and Sephacryl.RTM. S-200).
      <br/>
      An example of purification of the ligase is given below.
      <br/>
      However, other well known procedures used in the purification of proteins can be employed, e.g. other column materials may be used such as Reactive Red, Sepharose.RTM. Q FF and Sepharose S FF.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      According to the present invention it has been shown that said ligase is able to catalyze the formation of phenoxyacetyl-coenzyme A, phenylacetyl-coenzyme A, adipoyl-coenzyme A and hexanoyl-coenzyme A from Mg2+, ATP, CoASH and phenoxyacetic acid, phenylacetic acid, adipic acid or hexanoic acid, respectively.
      <br/>
      When assayed in the same systems (e.g. as described in the examples below) the ligase does not show any significant activity towards acetic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      The enzyme is unstable in vitro, but addition of ATP, Mg2+ and mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol (DTT), ascorbic acid or other reducing agents stabilizes the activity during purification and storage significantly.
      <br/>
      The presence of a high concentration of ammonium sulphate or glycerol also stabilizes the enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="107">Based on the consumption of CoASH in the assay the activity towards phenylacetic acid is approximately 80% of the activity towards phenoxyacetic acid, under the test conditions described below in example 6.</p>
    <p num="108">
      Only when assayed in the absence of other thiols (e.g. mercaptoethanol, dithiotreitol (DTT)), a direct phenoxyacetyl-coenzyme A synthetic activity was observed.
      <br/>
      However, incubation of ligase with ATP, Mg2+, CoASH, phenoxyacetic acid and e.g. mercaptoethanol leads to the formation of a compound which has the same UV-spectrum as the thioester of phenoxyacetic acid and mercaptoethanol, phenoxyacetyl-S--CH2 --CH3, which also can act as a substrate for the acyltransferase (AT).
    </p>
    <p num="109">In an embodiment of the invention, said enzyme is immunoreactive with an antibody raised against a purified ligase, of the invention, derived from Penicillium chrysogenum strain B10.</p>
    <p num="110">
      The immunochemical properties of the enzyme can be determined immunologically by cross-reaction identity tests.
      <br/>
      The identity tests can be performed by the well-known Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion procedure or by tandem crossed immunoelectrophoresis according to N. H. Axelsen; Handbook of Immunoprecipitation-in-Gel Techniques; Blackwell Scientific Publications, chapters 5 and 14, 1983.
      <br/>
      The terms "antigenic identity" and "partial antigenic: identity" are described in the same book, chapters 5, 19 and 20.
    </p>
    <p num="111">The enzyme according to the invention is a polypeptide.</p>
    <p num="112">In the present context enzymes according to the invention include mature proteins or precursor forms thereof and functional fragments thereof which essentially have the activity of the full-length polypeptides.</p>
    <p num="113">
      Further contemplated according to the invention are homologues of said enzymes.
      <br/>
      Such homologues comprise an amino acid sequence exhibiting a degree of identity of at least between 50% and 70%, better between 70% and 80%, even better up to 100%, with the amino acid sequence of the enzyme according to the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      The degree of identity may be determined by conventional methods, see for instance: Altshul et al., Bull. Math. Bio., 48, p. 603-616, 1986, and Henikoff and Henikoff, Proc.
      <br/>
      Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89, p. 100915-10919, 1992.
      <br/>
      Briefly, two amino acid sequences are aligned to optimize the alignment scores using a gab opening penalty of 10, a gap extension penalty of 1, and "blosum 62" scoring matrix of Henikoff and Henikoff, supra.
    </p>
    <p num="115">Alternatively, the homologue of the enzyme according to the invention may be one encoded by a nucleotide sequence hybridizing with an oligonucleotide probe prepared on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of said enzyme exhibiting ligase activity.</p>
    <p num="116">Molecules to which the oligonucleotide probe hybridizes under these conditions are detected using standard detection procedures (e.g. Southern blotting).</p>
    <p num="117">
      Homologues of the present polypeptide may have one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions.
      <br/>
      These changes are preferably of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions that do not adversely affect the folding or activity of the protein, small deletions, typically of one to about 30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino-terminal methionine residue, a small linker peptide of up to about 20-25 residues, or a small extension that facilitates purification, such as a poly-histidine tract, an antigenic epitope or a binding domain.
      <br/>
      See in general Ford et al., Protein Expression and Purification, 2, p. 95-107, 1991.
      <br/>
      Examples of conservative substitutions are within the group of basic amino acids (such as arginine, lysine, histidine), acidic amino acids (such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid), polar amino acids (such as glutamine and asparagine), hydrophobic amino acids (such as leucine, isoleucine, valine), aromatic amino acids (such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine) and small amino acids (such as glycine, alanine, serine, threonine, methionine).
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      It will be apparent to persons skilled in the art that such substitutions can be made outside the regions critical to the function of the molecule and still result in an active enzyme.
      <br/>
      Amino acids essential to the activity of the enzyme of the invention, and therefore preferably not subject to substitution, may be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, Science, 244, p. 1081-1085, 1989).
      <br/>
      In the latter technique mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for biological activity (e.g. ligase activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule.
      <br/>
      Sites of ligand-receptor interaction can also be determined by analysis of crystal structure as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography or photoaffinity labelling.
      <br/>
      See, for example, de Vos et al., Science, 255, p. 306-312, 1992; Smith et al., J. Mol. Biol., 224, p. 899-904, 1992; Wlodaver et al., FEBS Lett., 309, p. 59-64, 1992.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      The homologue may be an allelic variant, i.e. an alternative form of a gene that arises through mutation, or an altered enzyme encoded by the mutated gene, but having substantially the same activity as the enzyme of the invention.
      <br/>
      Hence mutations can be silent (no change in the encoded enzyme) or may encode enzymes having altered amino acid sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="120">The homologue of the present enzyme may also be a species homologue, i.e. an enzyme with a similar activity derived from another species.</p>
    <p num="121">
      A homologue of the enzyme may be isolated by preparing a genomic or cDNA library of a cell of the species in question, and screening for DNA sequences coding for all or part of the homologue by using synthetic oligonucleotide probes in accordance with standard techniques, e.g. as described by Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd.

    <p num="122">Further homologues of the present enzyme are those which are immunologically cross-reactive with antibodies raised against the enzyme of the invention.</p>
    <p num="123">Another object of the invention is to provide a DNA construct encoding said enzyme exhibiting ligase activity.</p>
    <p num="124">
      As used herein the term "DNA construct" is intended to indicate any nucleic acid molecule of cDNA, genomic DNA, synthetic DNA or RNA origin.
      <br/>
      The term "construct" is intended to indicate a nucleic acid segment which may be single- or double-stranded, and which may be based on a complete or partial naturally occurring nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest.
      <br/>
      The construct may optionally contain other nucleic acid segments.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      The DNA construct of the invention, encoding the polypeptide of the invention, may suitably be of genomic or cDNA origin, for instance obtained by preparing a genomic or cDNA library and screening for DNA sequences coding for all or part of the polypeptide by hybridization using synthetic oligonucleotide probes in accordance with standard techniques (cf. Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd.
      <br/>
      Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989).
      <br/>
      For the present purpose, the DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide is preferably of filamentous fungi- or bacterial origin.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      The DNA construct of the invention encoding the polypeptide may also be prepared synthetically by established standard methods, e.g. the phosphoamidite method described by Beaucage and Caruthers, Tetrahedron Letters, 22, p. 1859-1869, 1981, or the method described by Matthes et al., EMBO Journal, 3, p. 801-805, 1984.
      <br/>
      According to the phosphoamidite method, oligonucleotides are synthesized, e.g. in an automatic DNA synthesizer, purified, annealed, ligated and cloned in suitable vectors.
    </p>
    <p num="127">Furthermore, the DNA construct may be of mixed synthetic and genomic, mixed synthetic and cDNA or mixed genomic and cDNA origin prepared by ligating fragments of synthetic, genomic or cDNA origin (as appropriate), the fragments corresponding to various parts of the entire nucleic acid construct, in accordance with standard techniques.</p>
    <p num="128">
      The DNA acid construct may also be prepared by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers, for instance as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202 or Saiki et al., Science, 239, p. 487-491, 1988.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment of the invention the DNA sequence is derivable from a filamentous fungus belonging to genus of Aspergillus, Penicillium or Cephalosporium, preferably from a strain of P. chrysogenum, C. acremonium, or A. nidulans, especially P. chrysogenum strain B10.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a recombinant vector or transformation vehicle comprising said DNA construct of the invention encoding said enzyme exhibiting ligase activity.
      <br/>
      The recombinant vector into which the DNA construct of the invention is inserted may be any vector which may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced.
      <br/>
      Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide of the invention is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA.
      <br/>
      In general, the expression vector is derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of both.
      <br/>
      The term, "operably linked" indicates that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert. for their intended purposes, e.g. transcription initiates in a promoter and proceeds through the DNA sequence coding for the polypeptide.
    </p>
    <p num="131">The promoter may be any DNA sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.</p>
    <p num="132">
      Examples of suitable promoters for use in filamentous fungus host cells are, for instance, the ADH3 promoter (McKnight et al., The EMBO J., 4, p. 2093-2099, 1985) or the tpiA promoter.
      <br/>
      Examples of other useful promoters are those derived from the gene encoding A. oryzae TAKA amylase, Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, A. niger neutral  ALPHA -amylase, A. niger acid stable  ALPHA -amylase, A. niger or A. awamori glucoamylase (gluA), Rhizomucor miehei lipase, A. oryzae alkaline protease, A. oryzae triose phosphate isomerase or A. nidulans acetamidase.
      <br/>
      Preferred are the TAKA-amylase and gluA promoters.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      It is often advantageous to use identical or similar promoters to regulate two or more of the biosynthetic genes in order to obtain a synchronized production of the intermediates involved in the  BETA -lactam antibiotic synthesis.
      <br/>
      If the production of intermediates is not synchronized an accumulation of intermediates (bottle neck) might arise.
      <br/>
      Consequently the production of  BETA -lactam antibiotic may be retained.
    </p>
    <p num="134">In an embodiment of the invention the promoter of said ligase gene is replaced by the promoter from another gene involved in the biosynthesis of  BETA -lactams.</p>

    <p num="137">The DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention may also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable terminator.</p>
    <p num="138">The recombinant vector of the invention may advantageously comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question.</p>
    <p num="139">The recombinant vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g. a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell, such as the gene coding for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or the Schizosaccharomyces pombe TPI gene (described by P. R. Russell, Gene, 40, p. 125-130, 1985), or one which confers resistance to a drug, e.g. ampicillin, kanamycin, tetracyclin, phleomycin, chloramphenicol, neomycin, hygromycin or methotrexate.</p>

    <p num="141">
      To direct a ligase enzyme of the present invention to the desired location within the host cell or into the fermentation media, a targeting signal or a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence), respectively, may be provided in the recombinant vector.
      <br/>
      The targeting signals or secretory signal sequence are joined to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme in the correct reading frame.
      <br/>
      Secretory sequences are commonly positioned 5' to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme, whereas the targeting signal sequences are commonly positioned 3' to the DNA sequence.
      <br/>
      The targeting signal or secretory signal sequences may be that normally associated with the enzyme or may be from a gene encoding another protein having the desired signal sequence.

      The signal peptide is preferably derived from a gene encoding A. oryzae TAKA amylase, A. niger neutral  ALPHA -amylase, A. niger acid-stable amylase, or A. nicer glucoamylase.

    <p num="143">
      According to the present invention the targeting sequence is preferably a targeting signal capable of directing the ligase activity to the desired location within the cell (e.g. to the microbodies).

      It is often desirable that potential targeting signals are maintained.
      <br/>
      However, the targeting signal may be replaced with other signals having the same function.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, if inserting the ligase coding sequence, lacking a suitable ligase targeting signal, into an organism, it may be added in order to have the ligase expression at the desired localization within the host cell.

    <p num="147">
      The DNA sequence encoding the present polypeptide introduced into the host cell may be either homologous or heterologous to the host in question.

      If homologous to the host cell, i.e. produced by the host cell in nature, it may be operably connected to an other promoter sequence or, if applicable, another secretory signal sequence and,/or terminator sequence than in its natural environment.
      <br/>
      The term "homologous" is intended to include a cDNA, semi-synthetically or synthetically produced DNA, sequence encoding a polypeptide native to the host organism in question.
      <br/>
      The term "heterologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence not expressed by the host cell in nature.
      <br/>
      Thus, the DNA sequence may be from another organism, or it may be a synthetic sequence.

      When expressing the enzyme in bacteria such as E. coli, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, typically as insoluble granules (known as inclusion bodies), or may be directed to the periplasmic space by a bacterial secretion sequence.

      In the former case, the cells are lysed and the granules are recovered and denatured after which the polypeptide is refolded by diluting the denaturing agent.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the periplasmic space by disrupting the cells, e.g. by sonication or osmotic shock, to release the contents of the periplasmic space and recovering the enzyme.

      Examples of cells of filamentous fungi are, e.g. Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp., Neurospora spp., Fusarium spp., Trichoderma spp. or Cephalosporins spp., in particular strains of P. chrysogenum, P. notatum, A. oryzae, A. nidulans, A. niger, or C. acremonium.
      <br/>
      Fungal cells may be transformed by a process involving protoplast formation and transformation of the protoplasts followed by regeneration of the cell wall in a manner known per se.

      The use of Aspergillus spp. for the expression of proteins is described in, e.g., EP 272 277, EP 238 023 and EP 184 438.

      When a filamentous fungus is used as the host cell, it may be transformed with the DNA construct of the invention, conveniently by integrating the DNA construct in the host chromosome to obtain a recombinant host cell.
      <br/>
      This integration is generally considered to be an advantage as the DNA sequence is more likely to be stably maintained in the cell.
      <br/>
      Integration of the DNA constructs into the host chromosome may be performed according to conventional methods, e.g. by homologous or heterologous recombination.
