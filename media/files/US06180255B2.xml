    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention is directed to an improved media for use with ink jet printers.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention is directed to an improved media which is superior as a receptor for phase change ink printing.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Transparent films displaying information are widely used throughout many different industries and for many applications.
      <br/>
      Typically, a positive image is formed by placing an ink or pigment onto a transparent plastic sheet.
      <br/>
      The image is then displayed by projection of transmitted light.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Phase change ink printing has been demonstrated to be a superior method of printing.
      <br/>
      Among the advantages offered by phase change ink printing is the ability to obtain a high optical density and large print areas without the necessity for removing large volumes of solvent after printing.
      <br/>
      The impact of phase change ink printing for transparencies has been impeded due to the lack of a suitable media.
      <br/>
      Transparent media designed for use with aqueous ink jet printers are often used but these exhibit insufficient adhesion between the phase change ink and the media.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Phase change inks are characterized by their ability to remain in a solid state at ambient to warm conditions yet melt to a liquid at the printing head operating temperatures.
      <br/>
      Exemplary printing apparatus are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,276,468. The physical thermomechanical properties of the solid glassy state, the solid rubbery plateau state and the liquid melt are all important in the design of the phase change inks and printers.
      <br/>
      Exemplary phase change inks are provided, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,372,852.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Contrary to solvent ink systems the phase change ink resides predominantly on the surface of the media and does not appreciably diffuse into the matrix of the media or coating.
      <br/>
      This phenomenon has challenged skilled artisans to develop a media which has suitable adhesion with the phase change inks.
      <br/>
      Media presently known in the art generates too weak of an adhesive bond to withstand even moderate impact.
      <br/>
      The prints delaminate easily during normal use.
      <br/>
      This is particularly a problem when large areas are printed.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Three methods are known in the adhesive art which increase the strength of the adhesive bond.
      <br/>
      The first is to increase the polarity of the surface to create high surface energy.
      <br/>
      This increases adhesion to the ink by a thermodynamic driving force to lower the total interfacial energy.
      <br/>
      The second increases the dispersive forces between media and ink by coating a primer with properties intermediate between the base polymer sheet and the ink.
      <br/>
      Using the rule that "like dissolves like" better anchorage results.
      <br/>
      However, neither approach provides the high impact resistance needed to avoid delamination in the impacted area.
      <br/>
      The third approach commonly used to improve adhesion increases the surface area.
      <br/>
      However, this results in large increases in surface haze, making the media no longer transparent.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Printing phase change ink at high percent surface coverage can negate high surface haze by filling in a rough surface.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to create clarity by overprinting clear phase change ink in low image density areas.
      <br/>
      Using this approach, the high surface area approach to increased phase change ink anchorage can be made to be essentially transparent after printing.
      <br/>
      But high surface area alone is not effective in increasing the impact resistance to acceptable levels, particularly if the porosity is not filled in by the ink, either by its being too narrow in radial dimension or too deep into the coating.
      <br/>
      What is required is a particular porosity with a large number of accessible pores with anchorage sites which provide lock points for the congealed phase change ink.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      There is a need for a media which will take full advantage of the properties offered by phase change ink printing.
      <br/>
      Provided herein is a coated media which exhibits excellent adhesion to phase change ink, offers adequate clarity, and greatly improves durability of the printed image as measured by increased resistance to ink removal.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Ink removal can either be from scratching with a hard object, adhesive removal by contact of the ink with an adhesive-containing object such as an adhesive tape, or by impact and consequent delamination of the phase change ink from the media surface.
      <br/>
      The first type of failure is largely a function of rheology of the phase change ink and as such is not addressed in the present invention.
      <br/>
      However, to the extent that ink is imbedded into the media as described in the present invention, removal by gouging with a blunt or sharp, hard object can be improved.
      <br/>
      Ink removal by adhesive contact is affected by the adhesion to the ink surface which depends in turn on its surface energy and as such is not addressed in the present invention.
      <br/>
      However, to the extent that the result actually loads the ink/media interface, a porous surface with ink imbedded into these pores breaks up the continuous failure line resulting in improved retention of ink at peel-like frequencies.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,753,360, which is commonly assigned, defines a media which is suitable for ink jet printing media.
      <br/>
      The results are based on a tape test which is a relatively mild test for adhesion.
      <br/>
      A more strenuous test, based on physical impact, indicates that a far superior film can be obtained which is described herein.

      The term "water soluble polymer" refers specifically to a polymer which dissolves in water completely as characterized by the hydrodynamic particle diameter in water as measured by light scattering.
      <br/>
      For purposes of the present invention, a polymer with a light scattering hydrodynamic particle diameter, in water, of no more than 0.05  MU m indicates molecular scale dissolution.
      <br/>
      A polymer with a light scattering hydrodynamic particle diameter, in water, of no more than 0.05  MU m is referred to herein as a water soluble polymer.
      <br/>
      The water soluble polymer preferably comprises at least one compound chosen from a group consisting of polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, methyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and gelatin.
      <br/>
      The water soluble polymer more preferably comprises at least one element chosen from a group consisting of polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and gelatin.
      <br/>
      The most preferred water soluble polymer is polyvinylalcohol with a degree of hydrolysis between 70 and 100%.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The term "water insoluble polymer" refers specifically to polymers which are described as consisting of a dispersion or emulsion of polymer in water and are characterized by the hydrodynamic particle diameter, in water, as determined by light scattering.
      <br/>
      A light scattering hydrodynamic particle diameter, in water, of greater than 0.05  MU m implies a dispersion of discrete particles containing one or more large molecule requiring stabilization by surfactants or other means to remain suspended.
      <br/>
      The water insoluble polymer preferably comprises at least one polymerizable monomer chosen from acrylic ester, olefin, aromatic substituted olefin, vinyl, aromatic substituted vinyl, urethane and unsaturated amide.
      <br/>
      The water insoluble polymers may comprise polar functionality with the proviso that the degree of functionality is below a level sufficient to form a water soluble polymer as characterized by having a hydrodynamic particle size of less than 0.05  MU m. A particularly preferred water insoluble polymer is styrene.

      <br/>
      Most preferred is a copolymer comprising a styrene core and a shell comprising an acrylic acid, examples of which are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,194,263; 5,214,096 and 5,460,827.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The ratio of water soluble polymer to water insoluble polymer is chosen to maximize the adhesion, as determined by impact resistance, and to take advantage of the ability of the phase change ink to adhere to the media while still maintaining adequate scratch protection.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the combined weight of water soluble binder and water insoluble binder comprise at least 50%, by weight, water insoluble polymer.
      <br/>
      Below 50% water insoluble polymer adhesion unexpectedly deteriorates.
      <br/>
      It is more preferable that the combined weight of the water soluble and water insoluble polymer comprise at least 70%, by weight, water insoluble polymer and most preferably at least 80% by weight water insoluble polymer.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the combined weight of the water soluble polymer and water insoluble polymer comprise no more than 95%, by weight, water insoluble polymer due to a decrease in adhesion between the media and the phase change ink.

      The preferred inorganic particulate material is silica with a hydrodynamic diameter in water of no more than 0.3  MU m. More preferably the inorganic particulate material has a hydrodynamic diameter in water of no more than 0.1  MU m. Also preferred as a particulate material is silica with a hydrodynamic diameter in water of no more than about 0.05  MU m. The silica is preferably at least 0.005  MU m. A hydrodynamic diameter in water between 0.005  MU m and 0.030  MU m with a specific surface area between 100 and 300 m2 /g is particularly advantageous for superior adhesion.
      <br/>
      More preferred for adhesion is a silica hydrodynamic diameter in water of 0.010 to 0.020  MU m with a surface area of 200 to 300 m2 /g.

      Specific examples are colloidal silica particles having a long chain structure in which spherical colloidal silica is coupled in a multispherical form.
      <br/>
      Also preferred is a colloidal silica in which the coupled silica is branched.
      <br/>
      Multispherically coupled colloidal silica is obtained by forming particle-particle bonds between primary particles of spherical silica by interspersing metal ions having a valence of two or more between the spherical silica particles.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the multispherically coupled colloidal silica has at least three particles coupled together.
      <br/>
      More preferably the multispherically coupled colloidal silica has at least five particles coupled together and most preferably the multispherically coupled colloidal silica has at least seven particles coupled together.
      <br/>
      The hydrodynamic diameter in water of the inorganic particulate material is determined as the diameter of a spherical particle with the same hydrodynamic properties as the sample in question.
      <br/>
      By way of example, a fibrous silica particle with dimensions of approximately 0.150  MU m by 0.014  MU m exhibits a hydrodynamic diameter in water of approximately 0.035  MU m.

      Aldehyde hardeners such as formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde are suitable hardeners for polyvinyl alcohol.
      <br/>
      Pyridinium based hardeners such as those described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,880,665, 4,418,142, 4,063,952 and 4,014,862 and imidazolium hardeners as defined in Fodor, et al, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,459,029; 5,378,842; 5,591,863 and 5,601,971 are suitable for use in the present invention.

      In the instant invention a crosslinker may be chosen to form intermolecular bonds between pairs of water soluble polymers, between pairs of water insoluble polymers, or between water soluble polymers and water insoluble polymers.
      <br/>
      If crosslinking is applied it is most preferable to crosslink the polymers to the inorganic particulate matter.
      <br/>
      It is preferable to apply any crosslinking additive just prior to or during coating.

      In the context of the present invention "gelatin" also refers to substantially equivalent substances such as synthetic analogues of gelatin.
      <br/>
      Generally gelatin is classified as alkaline gelatin, acidic gelatin or enzymatic gelatin.
      <br/>
      Alkaline gelatin is obtained from the treatment of collagen with a base such as calcium hydroxide, for example.
      <br/>
      Acidic gelatin is that which is obtained from the treatment of collagen in acid such as, for example, hydrochloric acid and enzymatic gelatin is generated with a hydrolase treatment of collagen.
      <br/>
      The teachings of the present invention are not restricted to gelatin type or the molecular weight of the gelatin with the proviso that after preparation of the gelatin a sufficient number of pendant carboxylic acid and amine groups remain for reactivity as taught herein.
      <br/>
      Carboxyl-containing and amine containing polymers, or copolymers, can be modified as taught herein so as to lessen water absorption without degrading the desirable properties associated with such polymers and copolymers.

      Polymethylmethacrylate beads can be added to assist with transport through phase change ink printers.
      <br/>
      Care must be taken to insure that the amount of beads is maintained at a low enough level to insure that adhesion of the phase change ink to the substrate is not deteriorated.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the beads should represent no more than about 1.0% by weight of the receptive layer.
      <br/>
      It is conventional to add surfactants to a coating solution to improve the coating quality.

      Above 200 mg/dm2 the adhesion advantage diminishes and the increased cost of raw materials is not justified.
      <br/>
      It is more preferred that the combined coating weight of the inorganic particulate material, the water soluble polymer and the water insoluble polymer be at least 40 mg/dm2.

    <p num="37">
      The primer layer is typically applied and dry-cured during the manufacture of the polyester support.
      <br/>
      When polyethylene terephthalate is manufactured for use as a photographic support, the polymer is cast as a film, the mixed polymer primer layer composition is applied to one or both sides and the structure is then biaxially stretched.
      <br/>
      The biaxial stretching is optionally followed by coating of either a gelatin subbing layer or an antistatic layer.
      <br/>
      Upon completion of the stretching and the application of the primer layer compositions, it is necessary to remove strain and tension in the support by a heat treatment comparable to the annealing of glass.

      Phase change inks are characterized, in part, by their propensity to remain in a solid phase at ambient temperature and in the liquid phase at elevated temperatures in the printing head.
      <br/>
      The ink is heated to the liquid phase and droplets of liquid ink are ejected from the printing head.
      <br/>
      When the ink droplets contact the surface of the printing media they quickly solidify to form a pattern of solid ink drops.
      <br/>
      This process is known as direct ink jet printing.

      Other devices deliver the liquid ink droplets to a heated drum, maintained just below the melting temperature of the phase change inks.

      Preferred phase change inks exhibit a high level of lightness, chroma, and rectilinear light transmissivity when utilized in a thin film of substantially uniform thickness, so that color images can be conveyed using overhead projection techniques.
      <br/>
      Another preferred property of the ink carrier is the ability to be reoriented into a thin film after printing without cracking or transferring to the rollers typically used for reorientation.

      A phase change ink printed substrate is typically produced in a drop-on-demand ink jet printer.
      <br/>
      The phase change ink is applied to at least one surface of the substrate in the form of a predetermined pattern of solidified drops.
      <br/>
      Upon impacting the substrate surface, the ink drops, which are essentially spherical in flight, wet the substrate, undergo a liquid-to-solid phase change, and adhere to the substrate.
      <br/>
      Each drop on the substrate surface is non-uniform in thickness and transmits light in a non-rectilinear path.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The pattern of solidified phase change ink drops can, however, be reoriented to produce a light-transmissive phase change ink film on the substrate which has a high degree of lightness and chroma, when measured with a transmission spectrophotometer, and which transmits light in a substantially rectilinear path.
      <br/>
      The reorientation step involves the controlled formation of a phase change ink layer of a substantially uniform thickness.
      <br/>
      After reorientation, the layer of light-transmissive ink will transmit light in a substantially rectilinear path.
      <br/>
      If the substrate on which the ink is applied is also light transmissive, a projected image having clearly visible intense colors can be formed when a beam of light is projected through the reoriented printed substrate.

      While not limited to any theory the mechanism proposed for the unexpected results shown herein is that flocculation induced by the water soluble polymer occurs with decreased force between coalesced particles.
      <br/>
      Due to the more open and less dense packing of the floc, an open structure is formed which is probably not as close packed as the structure which would form in the absence of flocculation.
      <br/>
      As evaporation continues the networks emerge from the structure of the floc.
      <br/>
      Upon further evaporation the surface of the floc network becomes exposed and capillary forces arise.
      <br/>
      The result of the capillary forces is that water surfaces of negative curvature occur in the interstices between particles.
      <br/>
      These forces arise partly because the solid/vapor interface has a higher energy than that of the solid/liquid interface.
      <br/>
      The liquid therefore tends to wet the solid.
      <br/>
      As the liquid covers the solid, a tensile stress appears on the liquid.
      <br/>
      Due to conservation this stress must be compensated by a compressive stress that shrinks the network forming islands and large pores.

      The receptor layer is applied to the support as a coating suspension in a solvent.

      The liquid solution evolves into an irregular surface with a wide range of shapes and tortuous patterns depending upon both the drying rate and the initial concentration of the coating solutions.
      <br/>
      At very low drying rates a porous film appears to be uniform but with numerous cracks.
      <br/>
      At drying rates between 150 and 800 mg H2 O/min. sq. dm. the film evolves into a sequence of rounded small islands separated by pores.
      <br/>
      As the drying rate increases further, the islands become larger.
      <br/>
      Measurements of the island size have been measured by using scaled electronmicrographs.
      <br/>
      At drying rates between 150 and 800 mg H2 O/min sq. dm. the island size is optimized.

      Tape test density is a quantitative measurement indicating the propensity of the phase change ink to remain adhered to the media under conditions of peel or delamination.
      <br/>
      The tape test is performed by adhering, using a 10 lb. roller weight, at least 10 cm of 3M Scotch Type 810 Magic Tape (19 mm wide) to cover all of a strip of a 5 cm * 5 cm square, maximum black density (Tektronix 016-1307-00 black wax) single layer wax ink crosshatched pattern (with 5  MU mm spaced 0.2 mm lines without ink) printed on the media using a Tektronix Phaser 340 in the paper mode at 300 * 600 dpi, (monochrome) leaving approximately 1 cm of tape unattached.
      <br/>
      By grasping the unattached tape tag, the tape is pulled off of the media and printed area in one single rapid motion.
      <br/>
      The density of the peeled (Tp) and the original inked (To) areas on the media are measured using a Macbeth TR927 densitometer zeroed with the clear filter and using the "density" selection, taking care to center the Macbeth spot in a single 5 mm * 5 mm crosshatched square.

      Impact represents a measure of the adhesion of the phase change ink under conditions of rapid delamination with higher numbers being preferred.
      <br/>
      Impact is measured by a Gardner Impact Tester (Cat No. 1G1121) from BYK Gardner, Silver Spring, Md.
      <br/>
      The tester is modified by placing a rubber stopper in the drilled out anvil to a position slightly above being flush with the top of the anvil.
      <br/>
      This is done so as to avoid gross distortions of the PET base film upon impact by the hammer.

      The weight used to deliver the hammer blow is the 125 gm weight available from BYK Gardner.
      <br/>
      A specially modified Tektronix Phaser 340 is used to deliver in one media pass a double layer of black ink uniformly to a 10 cm * 19 cm area and after waiting for at least five minutes for the wax layer to come to room temperature, impacts are delivered from a height of 10 cm to each of four spots on a line parallel to the leading edge of the printed sheet on the side opposite the wax.
      <br/>
      One impact is delivered in the first spot, two in the second in succession, and so on up to a maximum of four impacts in the fourth spot.
      <br/>
      After impacting, Scotch Magic(TM) Tape (type 810) form 3M Company, St.

      Paul, Minn. is applied over the impacted spots and slowly removed to lift any dislodged ink.

      <br/>
      Brass weights up to 900 g. in the continuous loading mode are used to bear on a spherical sapphire stylus of 0.38 mm radius of curvature, allowing an estimated maximum loading of 300 kgm/cm2.

      Since the stylus is a constant, the results can be reported in gram mass required to break through the coating to the surface of the base polymer.
      <br/>
      Scratch data is typically accurate to within approximately 50 gms.

      The major improvement claimed in the present invention is in the retention of ink/media anchorage in impact.
      <br/>
      Impact is delivered over a short time frame and hence contains frequencies (time transform) which are much higher than those encountered in peel.
      <br/>
      It is in the damping of these high frequency energies that a high surface area mechanical bond is most effective.
      <br/>
      The physical disruption of a propagating crack at this interface is a factor.
      <br/>
      In addition, the rapid dissipation of energy is enhanced by soft materials in contact.
      <br/>
      This both the mechanical properties and physical structure of the media in contact with the phase change ink is important.
      <br/>
      The present invention teaches the use of soft, largely organic coatings with many pores possessing inwardly (negatively) sloped walls which anchor mechanically to the phase change ink penetrating into these pores, providing high interfacial area, crack propagation disruption, and a stabilized mechanical lock.
