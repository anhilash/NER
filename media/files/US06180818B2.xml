      No. 09/146,041 filed Sep. 2, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,114,780, which is a divisional of application Ser.

      No. 08/659,722 filed Jun. 6, 1996 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,851,754, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a light-sensitive silver halide photographic material, more specifically, the present invention relates to a photographic material less changeable in the photographic capability after storage and less changeable in the photographic capability after photographing until development processing.</p>
    <p num="3">Further, the present invention relates to a silver halide photographic material causing less generation of fog.</p>
    <p num="4">Furthermore, the present invention relates to a novel hydroxamic acid-base compound capable of providing photographically useful effects.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">Silver halide photographic materials are not only demanded to have high sensitivity but also be less changeable in the photographic capability during storage after the preparation of the photographic material and also less changeable in the photographic capability after photographing until development processing.</p>
    <p num="6">Out of changes in the photographic capability after photographing until development processing, with respect to the prevention of latensification, JP-A-59-162546 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") discloses a method of using a hardening agent having an active vinyl group in combination with a triazine-base compound.</p>
    <p num="7">However, the above-described method is insufficient in the prevention effect and a further improvement has been demanded.</p>
    <p num="8">
      On the other hand, full color photographic materials use a plurality of emulsions different in the spectral sensitivity as a superposed layer structure, thereby achieving the object of full color photograph.
      <br/>
      The emulsions used therein have been fairly improved, however, they are still unsatisfactory because fogging of the latent image or intensification/regression is caused.
      <br/>
      In order to improve storability of the emulsion, for example, 2-hydroxamino-1,3,5-triazines are effective.
      <br/>
      However, the layers are different in the storability from each other depending upon the emulsion used therein.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in recent years, it is being rather strongly demanded to improve storability of a latent image of a specific emulsion layer.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Many of known 2-hydroxylamine-1,3,5-triazines diffuse and act on the emulsion in the layer other than the objective layer and as a result, the balance in the gradation among respective layers is lost.
      <br/>
      Further, hydroxamic acids having a specific structure described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,339,515 and 4,330,606, JP-A-59-198453 and JP-A-3-293666 are used to improve storability of a color image or as a nucleophilic agent and different from the present invention in the use object.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the above-described hydroxamic acids are insufficient in causing action only on an emulsion in a specific layer.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a method for greatly improving the storability of a latent image only in the objective layer has been keenly demanded.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The present invention provides a method for improving storability of an emulsion in a specific layer and stability of a latent image.</p>
    <p num="11">In order to overcome the above-described problems, the present inventors have made extensive investigations on the method for improving storability of an emulsion produced and storability of a latent image, in particular, on the structure of compounds, and as a result, they have found a novel hydroxamic acid-base compound having a specific structure for use in the present invention.</p>
    <p num="12">The compound for use in the present invention is found, when added to a silver halide photographic material, able to achieve the objects of the present invention without changing the hue of the dye formed, affecting the dye formation speed of couplers, accelerating the decomposition of the coupler or the dye formed, deteriorating the layer strength or fogging the emulsion.</p>
    <p num="13">
      Out of the compounds for use in the present invention, the compounds represented by formulae (IVA), (IVB), (VA) and (VB) are completely novel compounds which have not known in the past.
      <br/>
      These compounds are first found to be photographically useful after investigations by the present inventors.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">A first object of the present invention is to provide a compound highly effective in improving the storability of a silver halide emulsion and storability of a latent image.</p>
    <p num="15">A second object of the present invention is to provide a method for improving storability of a latent image using the above-described compound.</p>
    <p num="16">A third object of the present invention is to provide a compound capable of improving storability only of a latent image in a specific layer.</p>
    <p num="17">A fourth object of the present invention is to provide a method for improving storability of a latent image using the above-described compound.</p>
    <p num="18">A fifth object of the present invention is to provide a compound capable of, when added, improving storability of a latent image without adversely affecting various photographic properties.</p>
    <p num="19">A sixth object of the present invention is to provide a method for improving storability of a latent image using the above-described compound.</p>

      When the present invention is applied to a color photographic material, the color photographic material may suffice if it has at least one light-sensitive layer on the support.
      <br/>
      A typical example thereof is a silver halide photographic material comprising a support having thereon at least one light-sensitive layer consisting of a plurality of silver halide emulsion layers having substantially the same spectral sensitivity but different light sensitivities.
      <br/>
      The light-sensitive layer is a unit light-sensitive layer having spectral sensitivity to any of blue light, green light and red light.
      <br/>
      In the case of a multi-layer silver halide color photographic material, the arrangement of unit light-sensitive layers are generally such that a red-sensitive unit layer, a green-sensitive unit layer and a blue-sensitive unit layer are provided in this order from the support side.
      <br/>
      However, depending upon the purpose, the above arrangement order may be reversed or a layer having different light sensitivity may be superposed between layers having the same spectral sensitivity.
      <br/>
      A light-insensitive layer may be provided between the above-described silver halide light-sensitive layers, as an uppermost layer or as the lowermost layer.
      <br/>
      These layers may contain a coupler, a DIR compound or a color mixing inhibitor which will be described later.
      <br/>
      Further, these layers may contain a compound which releases imagewise or reverse-imagewise dyes and causes difference in the diffusibility between the dye released and the compound before the release.
    </p>
    <p num="199">
      The silver halide emulsion layers in plurality constituting each unit light-sensitive layer are preferably arranged such that two layers of a high-sensitivity emulsion layer and a low-sensitivity emulsion layer are provided so that the light sensitivity can be lowered in sequence towards the support as described in German Patent 1,121,470 and British Patent 923,045.
      <br/>
      Further, it may also be possible to provide a low-sensitivity emulsion layer farther from the support and a high-sensitivity emulsion layer nearer to the support as described in JP-A-57-112751, JP-A-62-200350, JP-A-62-206541 and JP-A-62-206543.

      Also, as described in JP-B-55-34932 (the term "JP-B" as used herein means an "examined Japanese patent publication"), a blue-sensitive layer/GH/RH/GL/RL may be arranged in this order from the farthest side to the support.
      <br/>
      Further, as described in JP-A-56-25738 and JP-A-62-63936, a blue-sensitive layer/GL/RL/GH/RH may be arranged in this order from the farthest side to the support.

      <br/>
      Even in the case when such a three layer structure having different light sensitivities is used, as described in JP-A-59-202464, a medium-sensitivity emulsion layer/a high-sensitivity emulsion layer/a low-sensitivity emulsion layer may be provided in this order from the farthest side to the support in the layer having the same spectral sensitivity.

    <p num="205">In order to improve color reproducibility, a donor layer (CL) having a spectral sensitivity distribution different from-that of main light-sensitive layers such as BL, GL and RL and capable of providing an interlayer effect, is preferably provided adjacent to or in the vicinity of a main light-sensitive layer as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,663,271, 4,705,744 and 4,707,436, JP-A-62-160448 and JP-A-63-89850.</p>
    <p num="206">The silver halide grain in the photographic emulsion may have a regular crystal from such as cubic, octahedral or tetradecahedral, an irregular crystal form such as spherical or platy, a crystal defect such as twin, or a composite form of these.</p>

      Furthermore, tabular grains having an aspect ratio of about 3 or more can be used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The tabular grain can be easily prepared by the methods described in Gutoff, Photographic Science and Engineering, Vol. 14, pp. 248-257 (1970), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,434,226, 4,414,310, 4,433,048 and 4,439,520 and British Patent 2,112,157.

      The crystal structure may be homogeneous, may comprise a halogen composition different between the interior and the exterior or may be stratified.
      <br/>
      A silver halide having a different composition may be conjugated thereto by an epitaxial junction or the silver halide may be conjugated with a compound other than silver halide, such as silver rhodanate or lead oxide.
      <br/>
      Also, a mixture of grains having various crystal forms may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="212">
      The above-described emulsion may be a surface latent image-type emulsion forming a latent image mainly on the surface, an internal latent image-type emulsion forming a latent image inside the grain, or a type forming a latent image both on the surface of and inside the grain.
      <br/>
      The emulsion may be either a negative type emulsion or a positive type emulsion (so-called autopositive emulsion).
      <br/>
      When it is a negative type emulsion, either a normal emulsion or a heat developable emulsion may be used.
      <br/>
      As one of internal latent image-type emulsions, a core/shell internal latent image-type emulsion described in JP-A-63-264740 may also be used and the preparation method of this emulsion is described in JP-A-59-133542.
      <br/>
      In this emulsion, the thickness of the shell varies depending upon the development process and the like, but it is preferably from 3 to 40 nm, more preferably from 5 to 20 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="213">
      The silver halide emulsion is usually subjected to physical ripening, chemical ripening and spectral sensitization before use.
      <br/>
      The additives used in these steps are described in RD No. 17643, RD No. 18716 and RD No. 307105 and the pertinent portions thereof are summarized in the table set forth later.
    </p>
    <p num="214">The photographic material of the present invention may use a mixture of two or more kinds of emulsions different at least in one property of the light-sensitive silver halide emulsion, such as the grain size, the grain size distribution, the halogen composition, the grain shape or the sensitivity, in the same layer.</p>
    <p num="215">
      It is preferred to apply a silver halide grain of which surface is fogged described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,082,553, a silver halide grain of which inside is fogged described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,626,498 and JP-A-59-214852 or a colloidal silver to a light-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and/or a substantially light-insensitive hydrophilic colloid layer.
      <br/>
      The term "silver halide grain of which inside or surface is fogged" as used herein means a silver halide grain which can achieve uniform (non-imagewise) development of a photographic material irrespective of an unexposed area or an exposed area.
      <br/>
      The preparation method of such a grain is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,626,498 and JP-A-59-214852.
      <br/>
      The silver halide forming the inside nucleus of a core/shell type silver halide grain of which inside is fogged may have a different halogen composition.
      <br/>
      The silver halide for the grain of which inside or surface is fogged may be any of silver chloride, silver bromide, silver iodobromide and silver chloroiodobromide.
      <br/>
      The fogged silver halide grain has an average grain size of preferably from 0.01 to 0.75  MU m, more preferably from 0.05 to 0.6  MU m. The grain may have a regular form or may be a polydisperse emulsion, but it is preferably monodisperse (namely, at least 95% by weight or by number of silver halide grains having a grain size within an average grain size  +- 40%).
    </p>
    <p num="216">
      In the present invention, a light-insensitive fine grain silver halide is preferably used.
      <br/>
      The term "light-insensitive fine grain silver halide" as used herein means a silver halide fine grain which is not sensitive to light at the imagewise exposure for obtaining a dye image and substantially not developed at the development process.
      <br/>
      The light-insensitive fine grain silver halide is preferably not fogged previously.
      <br/>
      The fine grain silver halide has a silver bromide content of from 0 to 100 mol % and may contain, if desired, silver chloride and/or silver iodide.
      <br/>
      It preferably contains from 0.5 to 10 mol % of silver iodide.
      <br/>
      The fine grain silver halide has an average grain size (an average of circle-corresponding diameters of the projected area) of preferably from 0.01 to 0.5  MU m, more preferably from 0.02 to 0.2  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="217">
      The fine grain silver halide can be prepared by the same method as that for the normal light-sensitive silver halide.
      <br/>
      The surface of the silver halide grain needs not be optically sensitized nor be spectrally sensitized.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferred to add a known stabilizer such as a triazole-base compound, an azaindene-base compound, a benzothiazolium-base compound, a mercapto-base compound or a zinc compound, to the fine grain silver halide in advance of the addition to a coating solution.
      <br/>
      A layer containing the fine grain silver halide grain may contain colloidal silver.

    <p num="278">
      In the photographic material of the present invention, the total thickness of all hydrophilic colloid layers on the side having emulsion layers is preferably 28  MU m or less, more preferably 23  MU m or less, still more preferably 18  MU m or less and most preferably 16  MU m or less.
      <br/>
      The film swelling speed T1/2 is preferably 30 seconds or less, more preferably 20 seconds or less.
      <br/>
      T1/2 is defined as the time required for the film thickness to reach a half (1/2) of a saturation film thickness which corresponds to 90% of the maximum swollen thickness achieved at the processing with a color developer at 30 (degree)  C. for 3 minutes and 15 seconds.
      <br/>
      The film thickness means a film thickness determined at 25 (degree)  C. and 55% RH (relative humidity) under humidity conditioning for 2 days.
      <br/>
      T1/2 can be measured by means of a swellometer described in A. Green et al, Photogr.
      <br/>
      Sci. Eng., Vol. 19, 2, pp. 124-129. The T1/2 can be adjusted by adding a hardening agent to gelatin as a binder or changing the aging conditions after coating.

      The swelling rate is preferably from 150 to 400%.
      <br/>
      The swelling rate can be obtained from the maximum swollen film thickness under the above-described conditions according to the formula:

    <p num="280">The photographic material of the present invention can be developed according to usual methods described in RD No. 17643, pp. 28-29, ibid., No. 18716, p. 651, from left to right columns and ibid., No. 307105, pp. 880-881.</p>
    <p num="281">
      The color developer used in development of the photographic material of the present invention is preferably an alkaline aqueous solution comprising as a main component an aromatic primary amine color developing agent.
      <br/>
      As the color developing agent, an aminophenol-base compound may be useful but a p-phenylenediamine-base compound is preferably used and representative and preferred examples thereof include compounds described in EP-A-556700, page 28, lines 43 to 52.
      <br/>
      These compounds may be used in combination of two or more depending on the purpose.
    </p>
    <p num="282">
      The color developer usually contains a pH buffer such as a carbonate, a borate or a phosphate of an alkali metal, or a development inhibitor or an antifoggant such as a chloride salt, a bromide salt, an iodide salt, a benzimidazole, a benzothiazole or a mercapto compound.
      <br/>
      The color developer may also contain, if desired, a preservative such as hydroxylamine, diethylhydroxylamine, sulfite, hydrazines (e.g., N,N-biscarboxymethylhydrazine), phenylsemicarbazides, triethanolamine and catecholsulfonic acids; an organic solvent such as ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol; a development accelerator such as benzyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, a quaternary ammonium salt and amines; a dye-forming coupler; a competing coupler; an auxiliary developing agent such as 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidone; a tackifying agent; and various chelating agents including aminopolycarboxylic acid, aminopolyphosphonic acid, alkylphosphonic acid and phosphonocarboxylic acid, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid, hydroxyethyliminodiacetic acid, 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid, nitrilo-N,N,N-trimethylenephosphonic acid, ethylenediamine-N,N,N,N-tetramethylenephosphonic acid, ethylenediamine-di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) and a salt thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="283">
      In carrying out reversal processing, the color development usually follows black-and-white development.
      <br/>
      The black-and-white developer uses known black-and-white developing agents such as dihydoxybenzenes (e.g., hydroquinone), 3-pyrazolidones (e.g., 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidone) and aminophenols (e.g., N-methyl-p-aminophenols), individually or in combination.
      <br/>
      The color developer or the black-and-white developer usually has a pH of from 9 to 12.
      <br/>
      The replenishing amount of these developers is, although it may vary depending on the color photographic material to be processed, generally 3 l or less per in of the photographic material and when the bromide ion concentration of the replenisher is lowered, the replenishing amount may be reduced even to 500 ml or less.
      <br/>
      When the replenishing amount is reduced, the contact area of the processing tank with air is preferably reduced to prevent evaporation or air oxidation of the solution.
    </p>
    <p num="284">
      The processing effect resulting from contact of the photographic processing solution with air in a processing tank can be evaluated by an opening ratio (=�contact area of the processing solution with air (cm2)� / �volume of the processing solution (cm3)�. The opening ratio as defined above is preferably 0.1 or less, more preferably from 0.001 to 0.05. The opening ratio can be reduced, for example, by providing a shielding material such as a floating lid on the surface of the photographic processing solution in the processing tank, by using a movable lid described in JP-A-1-82033 or by a slit development method described in JP-A-63-216050.
      <br/>
      The opening ratio is preferably reduced not only in the color development and black-and-white development but also in any subsequent step such as bleaching, bleach-fixing, fixing, water washing or stabilization.
      <br/>
      Further, by using a means for suppressing the accumulation of bromide ions in the developer, the replenishing amount can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="285">The color development time is usually set to from 2 to 5 minutes, however, further reduction in the processing time can be achieved by carrying out the processing at a high temperature and a high pH and by using a color developing agent in a high concentration.</p>
    <p num="286">
      After color development, the photographic emulsion layer is usually subjected to bleaching.
      <br/>
      The bleaching may be conducted at the same time with the fixing (bleach-fixing) or may be conducted separately.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of rapid processing, the bleaching may be followed by bleach-fixing.
      <br/>
      Further, a processing in a bleach-fixing bath consisting of two continuous tanks, a processing comprising fixing before bleach-fixing or a processing comprising bleaching after bleach-fixing may be freely selected depending upon the purpose.
      <br/>
      Examples of the bleaching agent include compounds of a polyvalent metal such as iron(III), peracids, quinones and nitro compounds.
      <br/>
      Representative examples of the bleaching agent include organic complex salts of iron(III), for example, complex salts with an aminopolycarboxylic acid such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid, methyliminodiacetic acid, 1,3-diaminopropanetetraacetic acid or glycol ether diaminetetraacetic acid, and complex salts with citric acid, tartaric acid or malic acid.
      <br/>
      Among these, an aminopolycarboxylic acid ferrate complex salt including an ethylenediaminetetraacetato ferrate complex salt and 1,3-diaminopropanetetraacetato ferrate complex salt is preferred in view of rapid processing and prevention of environmental pollution.
      <br/>
      Further, the aminopolycarboxylic acid ferrate complex salt is particularly useful for the bleaching solution or for bleach-fixing solution.
      <br/>
      The bleaching solution or the bleach-fixing solution using the aminopolycarboxylic acid ferrate complex salt has a pH of generally from 4.0 to 8 but the processing may be carried out at a lower pH for expediting the processing.
    </p>
    <p num="287">
      A bleaching accelerator may be used, if desired, in the bleaching solution, the bleach-fixing solution or a prebath thereof.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of useful bleaching accelerators include compounds described in the following specifications: for example, compounds having a mercapto group or a disulfide group described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,893,858, German Patent Nos. 1,290,812 and 2,059,988, JP-A-53-32736, JP-A-53-57831, JP-A-53-37418, JP-A-53-72623, JP-A-53-95630, JP-A-53-95631, JP-A-53-104232, JP-A-53-124424, JP-A-53-141623, JP-A-53-28426 and RD No. 17129 (July, 1978); thiazolidine derivatives described in JP-A-50-140129; thiourea derivatives described in JP-B-45-8506, JP-A-52-20832, JP-A-53-32735 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,706,561; iodide salts described in German Patent 1,127,715 and JP-A-58-16235; polyoxyethylene compounds described in German Patent Nos. 966,410 and 2,748,430; polyamine compounds described in JP-B-45-8836; compounds described in JP-A-49-40943, JP-A-49-59644, JP-A-53-94927, JP-A-54-35727, JP-A-55-26506 and JP-A-58-163940; and bromide ion.
      <br/>
      Among these, compounds having a mercapto group or a disulfide group are preferred in view of a large acceleration effect and in particular, compounds described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,893,858, German Patent No. 1,290,812 and JP-A-53-95630 are preferred.
      <br/>
      Also, compounds described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,552,834 are preferred.
      <br/>
      The bleaching accelerator may be incorporated into the photographic material.
      <br/>
      The bleaching accelerator is particularly effective in bleach-fixing a color photographic material for photographing.
    </p>
    <p num="288">
      In addition to the above-described compounds, the bleaching solution or the bleach-fixing solution preferably contains an organic acid in order to prevent bleaching stains.
      <br/>
      A particularly preferred organic acid is compounds having an acid dissociation constant (pKa) of from 2 to 5 and specific examples thereof include acetic acid, propionic acid and hydroxyacetic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="289">
      Examples of the fixing agent for use in the fixing solution or the bleach-fixing solution include thiosulfates, thiocyanates, thioether-base compounds, thioureas and a large quantity of iodides.
      <br/>
      Among these, the thiosulfate is commonly used and an ammonium thiosulfate can be most widely used.
      <br/>
      Also, a combination use of a thiosulfate with a thiocyanate, a thioether-base compound or a thiourea is preferred.
      <br/>
      As the preservative for the fixing solution or the bleach-fixing solutions sulfites, bisulfites, carbonyl bisulfite adducts and sulfinic acid compounds described in EP-A-294769 are preferred.
      <br/>
      Further, the fixing solution or the bleach-fixing solution preferably contains various aminopolycarboxylic acids or organic phosphonic acids for the purpose of stabilization of the solution.
    </p>
    <p num="290">In the present invention, in order to adjust the pH, a compound having a pKa of from 6.0 to 9.0, preferably, an imidazole such as imidazole, 1-methylimidazole, 1-ethylimidazole and 2-methylimidazole is preferably added to the fixing solution or the bleach-fixing solution in an amount of from 0.1 to 10 mol/liter.</p>
    <p num="291">
      The total desilvering time is preferably as short as possible if desilvering failure is not caused.
      <br/>
      The time is preferably from 1 to 3 minutes, more preferably from 1 to 2 minutes.
      <br/>
      The processing temperature is from 25 to 50 (degree)  C., preferably from 35 to 45 (degree)  C. In this preferred temperature range, the desilvering rate is improved and the occurrence of stains after processing can be effectively prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="292">
      In the desilverization, the stirring is preferably intensified as highly as possible.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of the method for intensifying stirring include a method of colliding a jet stream of a processing solution against the emulsion surface of the photographic material described in JP-A-62-183460, a method of increasing the stirring effect using a rotary means described in JP-A-62-183461, a method of increasing the stirring effect by moving the photographic material while putting the emulsion surface into contact with a wire blade provided in the solution to cause turbulence on the emulsion surface, and a method of increasing the circulation flow rate of the entire processing solutions.
      <br/>
      Such a means for intensifying the stirring is effective in any of the bleaching solution, the bleach-fixing solution and the fixing solution.
      <br/>
      The intensification of stirring is considered to increase the supply rate of the bleaching agent or the fixing agent into the emulsion layer and as a result, to elevate the desilverization rate.
      <br/>
      The above-described means for intensifying stirring is more effective when a bleaching accelerator is used and in this case, the acceleration effect can be outstandingly increased or the fixing inhibitory action by the bleaching accelerator can be eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="293">
      The automatic developing machine used for the photographic material of the present invention preferably has a transportation means of a photographic material described in JP-A-60-191257, JP-A-60-191258 and JP-A-60-191259.
      <br/>
      As described in JP-A-60-191257 above, the transportation means can achieve extreme decrease in the amount of a processing solution carried over from a previous bath to a post bath, provide a great effect in preventing the deterioration in capacity of the processing solution and be particularly effective in reducing the processing time or decreasing the replenishing amount of a processing solution in each step.
    </p>
    <p num="294">
      The photographic material of the present invention is generally subjected to water washing and/or stabilization after desilvering.
      <br/>
      The amount of water in water washing can be set over a wide range according to the characteristics (e.g., due to the material used such as a coupler) or the use of the a photographic material and in addition, the temperature of washing water, the number of water washing tanks (stage number), the replenishing system such as countercurrent and co-current or other various conditions.
      <br/>
      Among these, the relation between the number of water washing tanks and the amount of water in a multi-stage countercurrent system can be obtained according to the method described in Journal of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Vol. 64, pp. 248-253 (May, 1955).
      <br/>
      According to the multi-stage countercurrent system described in the above-described publication, the amount of washing water may be greatly reduced but due to the increase in the residence time of water in the tank, a problem is caused such that bacteria proliferate and the floats generated adhere to the photographic material.
      <br/>
      In order to solve such a problem, a method of reducing calcium ions or magnesium ions described in JP-A-62-288838 can be very effectively used.
      <br/>
      Further, isothiazolone compounds and thiabendazoles described in JP-A-57-8542, chlorine-base bactericides such as sodium chlorinated isocyanurate, benzotriazoles and bactericides described in Hiroshi Horiguchi, Bokin, Bobai-Zai no Kagaku, Sankyo Shuppan (1986), Biseibutsu no Mekkin, Sakkin, Bobai-Gijutsu compiled by Eisei Gijutsu Kai, issued by Kogyo Gijutsu Kai (1982), and Bokin-Bobai Zai Jiten compiled by Nippon Bokin Bobai Gakkai (1986) can be also used.
    </p>
    <p num="295">
      The washing water in the processing of the photographic material of the present invention has a pH of from 4 to 9, preferably from 5 to 8.
      <br/>
      The temperature and the processing time of water washing may be set variously according to the characteristics and use of the photographic material, but they are commonly from 15 to 45 (degree)  C. and from 20 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably from 25 to 40 (degree)  C. and from 30 seconds to 5 minutes, respectively.
      <br/>
      The photographic material of the present invention can be processed directly with a stabilizing solution in place of the above-described water washing.
      <br/>
      In such a stabilization processing, any known methods described in JP-A-57-8543, JP-A-58-14834 and JP-A-60-220345 can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="296">
      In some cases, the stabilization processing may be further carried out after the above-described water washing.
      <br/>
      An example thereof is a stabilization bath containing a dye stabilizing agent and a surface active agent used as a final bath of a color photographic material for photographing.
      <br/>
      Examples of the dye stabilizing agent include aldehydes such as formalin and glutaraldehyde, N-methylol compounds and hexamethylenetetramine or aldehyde sulfite addition products.
    </p>
    <p num="297">This stabilization bath may also contain various chelating agents and antimolds.</p>
    <p num="298">The overflow solution accompanying the replenishing of the above-described washing water and/or stabilization solution can be re-used in other processing steps such as desilvering.</p>
    <p num="299">In the processing, for example, using an automatic developing machine, if the above-described respective processing solutions are concentrated due to evaporation, water is preferably added to correct the concentration.</p>
    <p num="300">
      A color developing agent may be incorporated into the photographic material of the present invention so as to simplify and expedite the processing.

      The polyester support which is preferably used in the present invention is described below.
      <br/>
      The details thereon including the photographic material, the processing, the cartridge and the experimental examples are described in JIII Journal of Technical Disclosure No. 94-6023 (Mar. 15, 1994).
      <br/>
      The polyester is essentially constituted by a diol and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid.
      <br/>
      Examples of the aromatic dicarboxylic acid include 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 1,5-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid. 2,7-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and phthalic acid, and examples of the diol include diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, cyclohexanedimethanol, bisphenol A and biphenol.
      <br/>
      The polymer polymerized from these includes homopolymers such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate and polycyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate.
      <br/>
      Among these, preferred is a polyester containing from 50 to 100 mol % of 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred is polyethylene 2,6-naphthalate.
      <br/>
      The average molecular weight is approximately from 5,000 to 200,000.
      <br/>
      The polyester for use in the present invention has a Tg of 50 (degree)  C. or higher, more preferably 90 (degree)  C. or higher.
    </p>
    <p num="404">
      The polyester support is then subjected to heat treatment to refuse to have curling habit at a heat treatment temperature of from 40 (degree)  C. to less than Tg, more preferably from (Tg-20 (degree)  C.) to less than Tg.
      <br/>
      The heat treatment may be conducted either at a constant temperature within the above-described range or while cooling.
      <br/>
      The heat treatment time is from 0.1 to 1,500 hours, more preferably from 0.5 to 200 hours.
      <br/>
      The support may be subjected to heat treatment either in a state of roll or as a web along the conveyance.
      <br/>
      The surface may be made uneven (for example, by coating electrically conductive inorganic fine particles such as SnO2 or Sb2 O5)) to improve the surface state.
      <br/>
      Also, it is preferred to make some designs such that the edge is knurled to slightly increase the height only of the edge, thereby preventing the difference in level due to the edge from imparting the evenness of support wound thereon.
      <br/>
      The heat treatment may be conducted at any stage of after formation of support film, after surface treatment, after coating of a back layer (e.g., antistatic agent, slipping agent) and after coating of an undercoat layer.
      <br/>
      The preferred stage is after coating of an antistatic agent.
    </p>
    <p num="405">
      Into the polyester, an ultraviolet absorbent may be kneaded in.
      <br/>
      Or, for preventing light piping, a commercially available dye or pigment for polyester, such as Diaresin produced by Mitsubishi Kasei Corporation or Kayaset produced by Nippon Kayaku K.K., may be mixed so as to attain the purpose.
    </p>
    <p num="406">
      The surface treatment is preferably conducted so that the support can be bonded to the photographic material constituent layer.
      <br/>
      Examples of the surface activation treatment include chemical treatment, mechanical treatment, corona discharge treatment, flame treatment, ultraviolet light treatment, high frequency treatment, glow discharge treatment, active plasma treatment, laser treatment, mixed acid treatment and ozone oxidation treatment.
      <br/>
      Among these surface treatments, preferred are ultraviolet irradiation treatment, flame treatment, corona treatment and glow treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="407">
      The undercoating method is described below.
      <br/>
      The undercoating may be single layer coating or two or more layer coating.

      <br/>
      The content of the antistatic agent in the photographic material is preferably from 5 to 500 mg/m2, more preferably from 10 to 350 mg/m2.
      <br/>
      The ratio of the electrically conductive crystalline oxide or a composite oxide thereof to the binder is preferably from 1/300 to 100/1, more preferably from 1/100 to 100/5.
    </p>
    <p num="410">
      The photographic material of the present invention preferably has slipperiness.
      <br/>
      The slipping agent-containing layer is preferably provided on both of the light-sensitive layer surface and the back surface.
      <br/>
      The preferred slipperiness is in terms of a coefficient of dynamic friction, from 0.01 to 0.25. The value is determined using a stainless steel ball having a diameter of 5 mm while transporting the photographic material at a speed of 60 cm/min (25 (degree)  C., 60% RH).
      <br/>
      In this evaluation, even when the other party is changed to the light-sensitive layer surface, the value almost on the same level is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="411">
      The slipping agent which can be used in the present invention includes polyorgarrosiloxane, a higher fatty acid amide, a higher fatty acid metal salt and an ester of a higher fatty acid with a higher alcohol.
      <br/>
      Examples of the polyorganosiloxane include polydimethylsiloxane, polydiethylsiloxane, polystyrylmethylsiloxane and polymethylphenylsiloxane.
      <br/>
      The layer to which the slipping agent is added is preferably an outermost layer of the emulsion layer or a back layer.
      <br/>
      In particular, polydimethylsiloxane and an ester having a long chain alkyl group are preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="412">
      The photographic material of the present invention preferably contains a matting agent.
      <br/>
      The matting agent may be provided either on the emulsion surface or on the back surface, but it is particularly preferably added to the outermost layer on the emulsion layer side.
      <br/>
      The matting agent may be either soluble or insoluble in the processing solution, and preferably, both of these two kinds of matting agents are used in combination.
      <br/>
      For example, polymethyl methacrylate, poly(methyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid=9/1 or 5/5 (by mol)) and polystyrene particles are preferred.
      <br/>
      The particle size is preferably from 0.8 to 10  MU m, the particle size distribution is preferably narrower, and 90% by number or more of all particles preferably have a size between 0.9 and 1.1 times the average particle size.
      <br/>
      In order to increase the matting property, fine particles of 0.8  MU m or less are preferably added at the same time and examples thereof include polymethyl methacrylate (0.2  MU m), poly(methyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid=9/1 (by mol), 0.3  MU m), polystyrene particles (0.25  MU m) and colloidal silica (0.03  MU m).

      <br/>
      The patrone of the present invention may further contain various antistatic agents and preferred examples thereof include carbon black, metal oxide particles, nonionic, anionic, cationic and betaine surface active agents and polymers.
      <br/>
      The patrone imparted with the antistatic property is described in JP-A-1-312537 and JP-A-1-312538.
      <br/>
      In particular, the resistance at 25 (degree)  C. and 25% RH is preferably 1012 OMEGA  or less.
      <br/>
      Usually, the plastic patrone is produced using a plastic having kneaded therein carbon black or a pigment so as to give light-shielding property.
      <br/>
      The patrone may be in a 135 size currently used but, in achieving down-sizing of camera, it is also effective to reduce the cartridge size from 25 mm of 135 size currently populated to 22 mm or less.
      <br/>
      The volume of the patrone case is preferably 30 cm3 or less, more preferably 25 cm3 or less.
      <br/>
      The weight of plastics used in the patrone and the patrone case is preferably from 5 to 15 g.

    <p num="415">
      A patrone which sends forth the film by the rotation of a spool may be used.
      <br/>
      Also, the patrone may have such a constitution that a film leading end is housed in the patrone body and the film leading end is sent forth from the port part of the patrone to the outside by rotating the spool shaft in the film delivery direction.
      <br/>
      These are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,834,306 and 5,226,613.

    <p num="449">2) Coating of Undercoat Layer</p>
    <p num="450">
      Both surfaces of the support obtained above was subjected to corona discharge treatment, UV discharge treatment and glow discharge treatment, and an undercoating solution containing 0.1 g/m2 of gelatin, 0.01 g/m2 of sodium  ALPHA -sulfodi-2-ethylhexylsuccinate, 0.04 g/m2 of salicylic acid, 0.2 g/m2 of p-chlorophenol, 0.012 g/m2 of (CH2.dbd.CHSO2 CH2 CH2 NHCO)2 CH2 and 0.02 g/m2 of a polyamido-epichlorohydrin polycondensate was coated (10 ml/m2, using a bar coater) on one surface to provide an undercoat layer on the higher temperature side at the time of stretching.
      <br/>
      The drying was conducted at 115 (degree)  C. for 6 minutes (rollers and the conveyance device in the drying zone all were heated to 115 (degree)  C.).

    <p num="451">3) Coating of Back Layer</p>
    <p num="452">On one surface of the undercoated support, an antistatic layer, a magnetic recording layer and a slipping layer each having the following composition were coated as a back layer.</p>
    <p num="453">3-1) Coating of Antistatic Layer</p>
    <p num="454">A fine particle powder dispersion having a resistivity of 5  OMEGA  * cm of a tin oxide-antimony oxide composite having an average particle diameter of 0.005  MU m (secondary aggregate particle size: about 0.08  MU m) was coated in an amount of 0.2 g/m2 together with 0.05 g/m2 of gelatin, 0.02 g/m2 of (CH2.dbd.CHSO2 CH2 CH2 NHCO)2 CH2, 0.005 g/m2 of poly(polymerization degree: 10)oxyethylene-p-nonylphenol and 0.22 g/m2 of resorcin.</p>
    <p num="455">3-2) Coating of Magnetic Recording Layer</p>
    <p num="456">
      Co- GAMMA -iron oxide (0.06 g/m2) (specific surface area: 43 m2 /g; longer axis: 0.14  MU m; single axis: 0.03  MU m; saturated magnetization: 89 emu/g; Fe+2 /Fe+3 =6/94; the surface being treated with aluminum oxide and silicon oxide each in an amount of 2 wt % based on iron oxide) subjected to covering treatment with 3-poly(polymerization degree: 15)oxyethylene-propyloxytrimethoxysilane (15 wt %) and dispersed in 1.2 g/m2 of diacetyl cellulose (the iron oxide being dispersed by an open kneader and sand mill) and 0.3 g/m2 of C2 H5 C(CH2 OCONH--C6 H3 (CH3)NCO)3 as a hardening agent were coated using acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and cyclohexanone as solvents by means of a bar coater to obtain a magnetic recording layer having a thickness of 1.2  MU m. Silica particles (0.3  MU m) as a matting agent and an alumina oxide (0.15  MU m) subjected to covering treatment with 3-poly(polymerization degree: 15)oxyethylene-propyloxytrimethoxysilane (15 wt %) as an abrasive each was added to give a coverage of 10 mg/m2.
      <br/>
      The drying was conducted at 115 (degree)  C. for 6 minutes (rollers and the conveyance device in the drying zone all were heated to 115 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The increase in color density of the magnetic recording layer DB with X-light (blue filter) was about 0.1, the saturated magnetization moment of the magnetic recording layer was 4.2 emu/m2, the coercive force was 7.3 * 104 A/m and the angular ratio was 65%.

    <p num="457">3-3) Preparation of Slipping Layer</p>
    <p num="458">
      Diacetyl cellulose (25 mg/m2) and a mixture of C6 H13 CH(OH)C10 H20 COOC40 H81 (Compound a, 6 mg/m2)/C50 H101 O(CH2 CH2 O)16 H (Compound b, 9 mg/m2) were coated.
      <br/>
      The mixture was prepared by melting the compounds in xylene/propylene monomethyl ether (1/1) at 105 (degree)  C. and pouring-dispersing the melt in propylene monomethyl ether (10-fold amount) at normal temperature.
      <br/>
      The resulting mixture was formed into a dispersion (average particle size: 0.01  MU m) in acetone and then added.
      <br/>
      Silica particles (0.3  MU m) as a matting agent and alumina oxides (0.15  MU m) covered with 3-poly(polymerization degree: 15)oxyethylenepropyloxytrimethoxysilane (15 wt %) as an abrasive each was added to give coverage of 15 mg/m2.
      <br/>
      The drying was conducted at 115 (degree)  C. for 6 minutes (rollers and the conveyance device in the drying zone all were heated to 115 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The thus-provided slipping layer had excellent capabilities such that the coefficient of dynamic friction was 0.06 (stainless steel ball: 5 mm PHI ; load: 100 g; speed: 6 cm/min), the coefficient of static friction was 0.07 (by clip method) and the coefficient of dynamic friction between the emulsion surface and the slipping layer, which will be described later, was 0.12.

      That is, 21.7 ml of water, 3 ml of a 5% aqueous solution of sodium p-octylphenoxyethoxyethoxyethanesulfonate and 0.5 g of a 5% aqueous solution of p-octylphenoxypolyoxyethylene ether (polymerization degree: 10) were poured into a 700 ml-volume pot mill, then thereto 5.0 g of Dye ExF-2 and 500 ml of zirconium oxide beads (diameter: 1 mm) were added and the content was dispersed for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      In this dispersion, a BO-type vibration ball mill manufactured by Chuo Koki KK was used.
      <br/>
      After the dispersion, the content was taken out and added to 8 g of a 12.5% aqueous gelatin solution and the beads were removed by filtration to obtain a gelatin dispersion of the dye.
      <br/>
      The dye fine particles had an average particle size of 0.44  MU m.

    <p num="513">Sample 701 as a multi-layer color photographic material was prepared to have layers each having the following composition, on a cellulose triacetate film support subjected to undercoating.</p>
    <p num="514">Composition of Light-Sensitive Layer</p>
    <p num="515">
      The coating amounts are expressed, in the case of silver halide and colloid silver, by the unit of g/m2 of silver, in the case of couplers, additives and gelatin, by the unit of g/m2 and, in the case of sensitizing dyes, by molar number per mol of silver halide in the same layer.
      <br/>
      The symbols used for additives have the following meanings.
      <br/>
      When the additive has a plurality of effects, one of the effects is used as a representative.

      The sensitivity as a photographic property is shown by a logarithm of the reciprocal of an exposure amount required to give an optical density 1.0 higher than the fog.
      <br/>
      The fluctuation in the photographic property after photographing until processing is shown by a relative sensitivity (difference in logarithms) of the sensitivity of photographic materials stored after exposure under forcedly deteriorating conditions to the sensitivity of the photographic material processed immediately after exposure.

    <p num="530">As clearly seen from Table 5, the photographic materials using the compound of formula (IB) for use in the present invention showed good results such that fluctuation in the photographic property due to aging after photographing until processing of the layer to which the compound was added (red-sensitive layer) was small and at the same time, fluctuation due to aging of the layer to which the compound was not added (blue-sensitive layer) was not worsened.</p>
    <p num="531">The compound of formula (IB) for use in the present invention affected neither other photographic properties nor storability of the layer to which the compound was not added.</p>
    <p num="532">EXAMPLE 8</p>
    <p num="533">
      Other than the compounds shown in Table 5 of Example 7, using Compound B-3, B-4, B-5, B-8, B-9, B-10, B-12, B-13, B-14, B-15, B-16, B-17, B-19, B-20, B-21, B-22, B-23, B-24, B-26, B-27, B-28, B-29, B-30, B-32, B-33, B-34, B-35, B-36 or B-37 for use in the present invention, evaluation was conducted.
      <br/>
      As a result, these compounds provided advantageous results such the the change in the photographic property due to aging was reduced when the materials were allowed to stand after photographing.
    </p>
    <p num="534">EXAMPLE 9</p>
    <p num="535">When the compound for use in the present invention was used in the green-sensitive layer or the blue-sensitive layer, similarly to Example 7, good results were provided such that the storability of the layer to which the compound was added was improved and the layer to which the compound was not added was not affected.</p>

    <p num="539">2) Coating of Undercoat Layer</p>
    <p num="540">The support obtained above was subjected to discharge treatments, coated by an undercoating solution and dried, in the same manner as in Example 4.</p>
    <p num="541">3) Coating of Back Layer</p>
    <p num="542">
      On one surface of the undercoated support, an antistatic layer, a magnetic recording layer and a slipping layer were coated as a back layer in the same manner as in Example 4.

      Then, each sample was subjected to development, fixing, water washing and drying in an automatic developing machine.
      <br/>
      The sensitivity of each sample is shown by a logarithm of the reciprocal of an exposure amount required to give an optical density 0.5 higher than the fog.
