    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      In case of a conventional golf bag, it is difficult for the golfer to carry it in a wide golf course that golf is played on because the golf bag is designed to be carried on his/her shoulder or in his/her hand.
      <br/>
      Accordingly the greater part of golfers make use of separate carrying devices such as golf carts or golf carriers or go with caddies to carry the golf bag for them who are playing golf.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless carrying the golf bag is still troublesome due to the weight and volume of the carrying device itself.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In this reason, the golf bag equipped with a carrier has been developed.
      <br/>
      However since several such brands and styles of a golf bag carrier known and widely used on golf courses have many parts and complicated structures to adjust the angle of the carrier, it is difficult to manipulate the carrier and manufacturing costs become rising.
      <br/>
      Also, since the conventional golf bag carrier is mounted to the mediate between left side and right side of the golf bag, the golf bag is hung down due to the weight thereof, thus the connection part between the carrier and the golf bag is capable of easily being damaged.
      <br/>
      When the connection part is damaged, it is difficult to exchange only the damaged part due to the complicated construction, thus the entire of the golf bag carrier must be repaired.
    </p>

    <p num="7">Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a golf bag equipped with a carrier which is capable of easily carrying the bag in any ground state and securely making it stand on the ground by simply and easily operating the angle of the carrier with respect to the golf bag.</p>
    <p num="8">Another object of the present invention is to provide a golf bag equipped with a carrier that is capable of easily being detached from the bag in non-use or in packing.</p>
    <p num="9">A further object of the present invention is to provide a golf bag equipped with a carrier that is capable of preventing it from being damaged due to the hang down phenomenon of the golf bag.</p>
    <p num="10">A further another object of the present invention is to provide a golf bag equipped with a carrier which is capable of easily carrying it in a comfortable posture by freely manipulating the angle of the handle when a golfer or a caddy carries it on the field.</p>
    <p num="11">A further another object of the present invention is to provide a golf bag equipped with a carrier which has a simple construction and a small number of parts, thereby remarkably reducing possibilities of troubles and weights of it.</p>
    <p num="12">A further another object of the present invention is to provide a golf bag equipped with a carrier which is capable of easily detaching/attaching wheels of the carrier according to an user's intention, thereby resolving the trouble of assembling work due to the size or weight of the carrier.</p>
    <p num="13">In order to accomplish the above objects, a golf bag equipped with a carrier according to the present invention comprises: a pair of supporting plates fixed in a body of the golf bag; a pair of main plates detachably mounted to the supporting plates; a pair of leg units rotatably/fixedly mounted to the main plates; a pair of wheel units engaged with the lower end of the leg units; and a handle unit engaged with the upper side of the body of the golf bag.</p>

      Referring to FIGS. 17 to 19, another carrier according to the present invention comprises: an inner plate 100 having fastening holes formed in a body 2 of a golf bag 1; an outer plate 200 having fastening holes formed in opposing to the fastening holes of the inner plate 100 for closely attaching it to the outer peripheral edge of the body 2, a first bearing unit 210, a second bearing unit 220 and a cover 250, and also fastening the inner plate 100 to the outer peripheral edge of the body 2; a leg unit 300; a wheel unit 400; and a handle unit 500.
      <br/>
      According to the above-described construction, it is capable of achieving compaction and stability of the golf bag carrier.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      That is, in this embodiment, since the fastening unit 230 is removed, and the inner and outer plates 100 and 200 are fastened with an ordinary fastener, that is, the carrier is a one body.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the sizes of the inner and outer plates 100 and 200 are minimized, which is capable of reducing the manufacturing cost of the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Hereinafter, the work of the present invention is described.</p>
    <p num="44">
      Firstly, in order to use the carrier 10 mounted to the body 2 of the golf bag 1 in the state that the carrier 10 is folded, the fitting piece 315 mounted to the V-shaped first leg 310 is pushed inward.
      <br/>
      And then the finishing members 311 mounted to the upper end of the first legs 310 are released from the first hooking grooves 215 formed on the supporting blocks 214 of the first bearing units 210, and moved to the protruding blocks 211.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the finishing members 311 compress the spring 213 of the protruding block 211 inserted into the insertion hole 312 of the finishing members 311, and the insertion hole 312 thereof is deeply moved into the hole 212 and then is positioned between the protruding block 211 and the supporting block 214.
      <br/>
      At this time, the first legs 310 are released from the first guide grooves 252 of the cover 250, and then are positioned at lower ends of the elongated guide slots 251, Accordingly, the first legs 310 are pushed upward.
      <br/>
      When the first legs 310 are pulled above the elongated guide slots 251, they are moved to the upper ends of the elongated guide slots 251.
      <br/>
      At this time, the fitting pieces 315 are released from the fitting state.
      <br/>
      When the fitting pieces 315 are released from the fitting state, the finishing members 311 of the first legs 310 are away from the protruding block 211 due to the spring force of the spring 213 of the protruding block 211.
      <br/>
      As a result, the first legs 310 are again widened.
      <br/>
      Also since the supporting lugs 313 and the shaft pin 314 of the finishing members 311 are guided to the second guide grooves 253 outwardly formed at the upper ends of the elongated guide slots 251, and then are inserted and hooked into the second hooking grooves 216 and the shaft grooves 217 of the supporting block 214, the first legs 310 are maintained in a widened state.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, since the second leg 320 is coupled to the second bearing unit 220 by the pin 323, it is always freely rotatable and is rotated in interlocked with the rotation of the first legs 310.
      <br/>
      Also the lower ends of the first legs 310 and the second leg 320 are inserted between the coupling pieces 331 of the trailing assembly 330, and are coupled with the pin 332.
      <br/>
      Therefore, they are freely rotated in interlocked with the rotation of the first legs 310 and the second leg 320.
      <br/>
      As above-described, when the first legs 310 and the second leg 320 of the carrier 10 installed to the body 2 of the golf bag 1 are widened, it is capable of using the golf bag 1 in an inclined state with respect to the bottom position of the body 2 and the right and left positions of the wheel unit 400 attached to the lower part of the leg unit 300.
      <br/>
      That is, since the body 2 of the golf bag 1 is substantially formed in cylindrical shape and the carrier 10 is installed at both sides of the outer peripheral edge of the body 2 in symmetry at a predetermined distance, the carrier 10 is closed to the outer peripheral edge of the body 2 in the case of folding the legs 310 and 320.
      <br/>
      The carrier 10 is widened more than the diameter of the body 2 in the case of unfolding the legs 310 and 320.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is capable of stably standing the golf bag 1 on the ground.
    </p>
    <p num="45">In this situation, the user is capable of adjusting the length and the angle of the handle unit 500.</p>
    <p num="46">
      Firstly, in order to adjust the angle of the handle unit 500, the butterfly nut 517 of the angle adjusting assembly 510 is released in a certain amount to be released from the engagement state of the first angle-adjusting member 512 and the second angle-adjusting member 514.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the angle of the adjusting assembly 510 is readjusted by rotating the second angle-adjusting member 514 at a desired angle.
      <br/>
      And then the saw teeth 513 of the first angle-adjusting member 512 and the saw teeth 515 of the second angle-adjusting member 514 are securely engaged by tightening the nut 517.
      <br/>
      As a result, the angle between the guide pipe 520 coupled to the second angle adjusting member 514 and the length adjusting bar 530 coupled to the guide pipe 520 is adjusted and established to the value desired by the user.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      On the other hand, in order to adjust the length of the handle unit 500, the length-adjusting unit 540 is released in a certain amount to be released from the tightened state of the length adjusting bar 530 by a groove 524 of the nipple 521.
      <br/>
      The length adjusting bar 530 is movable to be passed through the insertion hole 522 of the nipple 521.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is capable of adjusting the length of the length adjusting bar 530 and then maintaining it in adjusted state.
      <br/>
      Since the upper side of the screw part of the length-adjusting instrument 540 has a tapered part, the groove 524 formed on the tapered part is narrowed according to the rotation of the screw part so that the length adjusting bar 530 is securely fixed to the desired position.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In order to use the carrier installed to both sides of the body 2 of the golf bag 1, the user holds the handle 532 engaged with the length adjusting bar 530 of the handle unit 500 and obliquely lies the body 2 of the golf bag 1 on the ground in the state that the first and the second legs 310 and 320 are entirely widened and the adjustment for the angle and length of the handle unit 500 are completed.
      <br/>
      The bottom surface of the body 2 of the golf bag 1 comes down on the ground.
      <br/>
      At this time, it is capable of easily moving the golf bag 1 to the desired position while the length adjusting bar 530 is being pulled.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      On the other hand, the wheel unit 400 comprises the hooking groove 432 formed in opposition to the intersection position of the shaft hole 333 and the operating hole 334 of the trailing assembly 330 in the outer peripheral edge of the rotational shaft 431 of the hub 430.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the button 335 is pushed, the button 335 compresses the spring 339 inserted into the operating hole 334 for moving the operating groove 337 of the button 335 to the intersection position of the shaft hole 333 and the operating hole 334.
      <br/>
      As a result, the body of the button 335 hooked in the hooking groove 432 of the rotational shaft 431 escapes from the groove 432, and the rotational shaft 431 also escapes from the hooking state.
      <br/>
      At this time, since the rotational shaft 431 is released, it is capable of easily separating the wheel unit 400 from the carrier 10.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In order to assemble the wheel unit 400, the rotational shaft 431 is inserted into the shaft hole 333 in the state that the button is pushed, and then the operating groove 337 of the button 335 is moved to the intersection position of the shaft hole 333 and the operating hole 334.
      <br/>
      At this time, when the hooking groove 432 of the rotational shaft 431 is positioned at the intersection position of the shaft hole 333 and the operating hole 334, the pushed state of the button 335 is released.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, since the button 335 is outwardly protruded by the spring force of the spring 339, the outer peripheral edge of the button 335 is inserted into the hooking groove 432 of the rotational shaft 431 positioned at the intersection position of the shaft hole 333 and the operating hole 334 to securely maintain the engaged state.
      <br/>
      As above described, since the wheel unit 400 is simply detached/attached from/to the trailing assembly 330, the packing or the transport of the golf bag 1 may be easily achieved.
      <br/>
      And also since the assembling work is implemented in a state that the weight and volume of the apparatus is minimized, it is capable of improving the workability and productivity.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In order to detach the carrier 10 from the body 2 of the golf bag 1, the operating buttons 237 protruded from the both sides of the outer plate 200 are pushed.
      <br/>
      At this time, the one end of the operating member 235 is guided to the inclined surface of the hooking groove 238 of the operating button 237, and then the operating member 235 is rotated so that the fastening instrument 231 is moved to the lower side to compress the spring 234.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, since the fastening instrument 231 which is inserted into the insertion space 121 of the fastening member 120 and is hooked in the front face of the hooking jaw 122 of the insertion space 121 is moved to the lower side, the upper end of the fastening instrument 231 escapes from the insertion space 121 of the fastening member 120 to be released.
      <br/>
      When the locking of the fastening instrument 231 is released, the outer plate 200 is forwardly pulled, so that the hooking state of the hooking groove 242 that is formed on the hooking piece 241 of the first supporting unit 240 is separated from the inner plate 100.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the body 2 and outer plate 200 are completely separated.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      In order to attach the carrier 10 to the body 2 of the golf bag 1, the hooking piece 241 of the first supporting unit 240 is inserted between the hooking bar 112 and the outer peripheral edge of the body 2, and then the hooking groove 242 of the hooking piece 241 is positioned to coincide with the hooking bar 112.
      <br/>
      Thereafter the upper side of the outer plate 200 is closed to the body 2 while the operating button 237 is pushed.
      <br/>
      At this time, the guide rod 130 inserted into the guide hole 260 functions to prevent it from swing and to accurately close to the guide hole 260.
      <br/>
      Also when the operating button 237 is pushed, the one end of the operating member 235 is guided to the inclined surface of the hooking groove 238, and then the operating member is rotated.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the other end of the operating member 235 inserted into the insertion space 232 of the fastening instrument 231 is rotated, so that the fastening instrument 231 is moved to the lower part while pushing the spring 234.
      <br/>
      In this situation, when the outer plate 200 is completely closed to the body 2 of the golf bag 1 and the pushed state of the operating button 237 is released, the fastening instrument 120 is moved to the upper side by the spring force of the spring 234.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, since the upper hooking piece 233 of the fastening instrument 231 to be inserted into the insertion space 121 of the fastening member 120 is hooked in the hooking jaw 122, the locking state is lastly maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      On the other hand, when the outer plate 200 is separated from the body 2 of the golf bag 1, the separating work is implemented while pushing the operating button 237.
      <br/>
      However, when the outer plate 200 is engaged with the body 2, the hooking piece 241 is inserted between the hooking bar 112 of the supporting unit 110 and the outer peripheral edge of the body 2, and then the hooking groove 242 of the hooking piece 241 is coincided with the hooking bar 112.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the engaging work is achieved by simply closing the outer plate 200 to the outer peripheral edge of the body 2 without pushing the button 335.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      As described above, the present invention provides a golf bag equipped with a carrier capable of simply and conveniently carrying the golf bag by coupling the carrier to the body of the golf bag without a separate cart.
      <br/>
      In non-use, it is capable of keeping the golf bag and the carrier in separated state or packing them in a box.
      <br/>
      Also, the present invention provides a golf bag equipped with a carrier capable of easily adjusting the angle of the carrier while carrying the golf bag and standing it on the ground.
