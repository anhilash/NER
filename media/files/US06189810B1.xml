    <p num="11">It is advisable that the relationship between the three regions be changed by changing the distance from the nozzles to the areas on which the perfume products are applied.</p>
    <p num="12">It is useful that during the spraying, the quantity of aerosol mixtures fed to each of the regions is adjusted.</p>
    <p num="13">It is also useful that perfume products having different concentration of the components composing the perfume composition be used for aerosol spraying.</p>
    <p num="14">It is preferable that adjustment of the quantity of fed aerosol mixtures be carried out by changing the diameter of the outflow orifice of a nozzle.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="31">
      A device for aerosol application of perfume liquids comprises in the variant being described two containers 1 (FIG. 1) and 2.
      <br/>
      Each container 1 and 2 is filled with a perfume liquid A and B respectively, which have different properties, for example, odors, i.e. is filled with different perfumes or different perfume components.
      <br/>
      Each container 1 and 2 has a spraying unit 3 made in the form of a pump with heads 4 and 5, respectively.
      <br/>
      The heads 4 and 5 comprise spraying nozzles 6 and 7 respectively, which are mounted at an angle  ALPHA  to each other, i.e. their axes intersect at an angle  ALPHA  (not shown in FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The device includes element 8 which ensures the simultaneous pressing of the heads and the release of liquid streams from spraying nozzles 6 and 7 at a predetermined angle relative to each other.
      <br/>
      The element 8 may be made in the form of a cap put on heads 4 and 5.
      <br/>
      The cap may be made with seats 9 and 10 for heads 4 and 5 of the pumps, the seats being positioned adjacent each other on one side of the cap.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The cap may also be made with seats 11 and 12, positioned on opposite sides of the cap and opposite each other (FIG. 2).</p>
    <p num="33">In another embodiment, the device comprises three containers 1, 2, 13 (FIG. 3), the pump heads of which are combined by one element 8.</p>
    <p num="34">The containers 1 and 2 may be combined in one flask by means of a bottom plate 14 (FIG. 1) or be one flask 15 with a partition 16, separating the cavity of the flask 15 into two parts, which form the containers 1 and 2 filled with the aforesaid liquids A and B (FIG. 4).</p>
    <p num="35">
      The flask 15 may have a parallelogrammic cross section (not shown in FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      In that case the partition 16 is arranged along its diagonal.
      <br/>
      The partition 16 may be made with a mirror surface or transparent, for example, with a titanium layer ensuring its transparency from one side and mirror-like reflection from the other.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The spraying nozzles 6 and 7 may be made both with identical diameter of the outflow orifices and with different diameters.
      <br/>
      The aforesaid nozzles 6 and 7 may be made in the form of micronozzles similar to the printing heads of jet printers.
      <br/>
      In that case the amount of the injected perfume liquids or their components is controlled by the processor on the basis of data and a program.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Such a device may be used as a composer of odors which is controlled by the user via a corresponding interface of the computer and/or program.
      <br/>
      A plurality of different odors may be formed using a device like the head of a jet printer.
      <br/>
      The micronozzles may be cleaned by ultrasound, injected by means of piezo crystals or electromagnetic guns and locks as in jet printers.
      <br/>
      Finely-dispersed distribution ensures the attainment of the necessary combination in air or on a corresponding surface.
      <br/>
      If a user has such a device, data for obtaining a certain odor may be obtained over telecommunications networks.
      <br/>
      For example, a user may obtain data for controlling the device from Internet.
      <br/>
      If there is a database on odors, the computer program may generate new odors in accordance with a specified task.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      FIG. 5 shows a diagram of a device for realizing a method for creating a perfume composition in accordance with the invention.
      <br/>
      Units 17 are containers with perfume liquids.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 18 is a pipeline connected to dispensers 19 and injectors 20.
      <br/>
      Embodiments are possible wherein the dispenser and injector are realized in one device (not shown in FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      Microprocessor 21, connected to main memory 22, controls the parameters of the dispenser and the injector.
      <br/>
      The power supply for the microprocessor and other operating units is not shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The microprocessor may be connected to read-only memories or to a telecommunications network.
      <br/>
      Operation of the microprocessor relating to injection of perfume liquids may be initiated by a program coupled to a processor timer or from interface 23, controlled by a user.
      <br/>
      The user interface 23 may be an On/Off button, a keyboard, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="39">The method for aerosol spraying liquid perfume products is realized by means of the aforesaid device in the following manner.</p>
    <p num="40">
      Containers 1 and 2 (FIG. 1) are filled with different perfume liquids A and B, which have different odors.
      <br/>
      For example, these may be different components of perfumes or deodorants or different perfumes or deodorants, having different odors.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Components of perfumes consisting of constituents having close odors or of constituents having antagonistic odors may be used in order to expand the spectrum of the obtained odors.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the method being patented makes it possible to use perfume components which lose their necessary properties in the case of lengthy maceration. I.e., it became possible to use such perfume components which, being in contact for a long period of time, either neutralize each other or release an unpleasant odor, but within a short period of time up to 24 hours provide the necessary original odor.
      <br/>
      Thus, using two different components, it is possible to obtain entirely new odors, wherein instead of two--three, two or one odor, differing one from the other.
      <br/>
      Selection of the aforesaid components in accordance with the coordinates of the map of perfumes, for example, a map in accordance with Table 1, and other maps compiled in accordance with other coordinates, makes it possible to more easily select the components which should fill containers 1 and 2.
    </p>
    <p num="42">Heads 4 and 5 enter the seats 9 and 10 or 11 and 12 and, thus, they are fixed in the required position with a predetermined angle to which nozzles 6 and 7 are directed relative to each other.</p>
    <p num="43">
      The flask is so positioned that the spraying nozzles 6 and 7 are mounted at a predetermined distance L (FIG. 6) from the region to be treated, for example, from an arm, clothes, neck of the user.
      <br/>
      Pressure is applied to the cap 8 (FIG. 1) or to the bottom of containers 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      As a result of the pressure the contents of the containers 1 and 2 are sprayed from the spraying nozzles 6 and 7 in the form of aerosol streams 24 and 25 (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      Since the axes of nozzles 6 and 7 are positioned at an angle  ALPHA  relative to one another, the aerosol streams 24 and 25 intersect, and in a certain region, for example, on the arm of a user, a new odor is formed at the areas of intersecting spots 26 (FIG. 7) and 27, which correspond to components A and B. Wherein, an odor is formed in region 28 which is a combination of the two components A and B.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      A different combination of odors A and B may be obtained by changing the distance L. For example, at a distance from the nozzles to the surface on which the odors are applied which is less than L1, only two separate odors A and B are obtained.
      <br/>
      Beginning from a distance which is greater than L1, a combination of odors of components A+B also appears.
      <br/>
      The combination A+B increases relative to separate values of A and B right up until only a mixture A+B is obtained at a distance L2.
      <br/>
      At a distance greater than L2, once again there is a combination of A+B, A+b and B+a, where: a is a part of the stream A, which is carried by the stream B, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Thus, three spots, having different odors and properties, different consumer properties, are obtained on the applied to surface, for example, on an arm.</p>
    <p num="46">
      Perfumes or deodorants are selected in such a manner that when they mix a new odor is obtained which is different from the odor of the composite components.
      <br/>
      Components of perfumes or deodorants, which themselves have original odors, and in combination with each other provide a new original odor, may be used as the perfume liquids.
      <br/>
      The method for applying perfume liquids which is being patented provides a wide field of activity in order to obtain new original odors and their combination.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      For example, one odor, consisting as a rule of many components, may be divided into two constituents.
      <br/>
      And one odor can be divided into two constituents by dozens of different methods, depending on the principle of dividing.
      <br/>
      For example, flower constituents may be put into one part, artificial odors into another.
      <br/>
      This separation may be done with accents, putting one and the same constituents in different amounts into different flasks.
      <br/>
      Or the most outstanding part of an odor, for example, tea rose, may be put into a separate constituent.
      <br/>
      In that case the note and the chord of the applied odor will be "taken" either together, or sequentially, depending on which odor will be closer to the user's nose, being in region 26 or 27.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The spaced application of odors onto the surface of clothes or a user's body during evaporation also provides a spatially spread odor.
      <br/>
      People near the user will feel different shades of the odors depending on the distance and the position of the user.
      <br/>
      The odor will seem to be spread in space according to its spectrum.
      <br/>
      Wherein, a user will sometimes note at the subconscious level an unusual change in the shades of the odors.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Another modification of the invention being patented is the possibility of using two or more containers with different perfume liquids (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      This even more expands the possibility of making odors directly in space, obtaining several odors instead of one.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Furthermore, making the spraying nozzles in the form of micronozzles of jet devices with electronic control makes it possible to create a mixture of microdoses of components in air or an intricate pattern of a compound of perfume liquids on a surface.
      <br/>
      Many "pure" components, necessary to obtain perfumes, are applied to the controllable head of the micronozzles.
      <br/>
      By controlling the amount of sprayed components, it is possible to obtain as a result a concrete bouquet of odors.
      <br/>
      Such a realization of the micronozzles makes it possible to obtain "new" odors by Internet in the form of data for a program controlling the spraying, i.e. a new fashionable odor may be obtained from Internet.
      <br/>
      This new odor is synthesized at the user directly before using.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The aforesaid method may be used to create odors by means of a computer.
      <br/>
      The number of components being mixed may be determined by a person, by a computer or by a person and computer.
      <br/>
      Wherein, the new combinations are obtained rapidly and very efficiently, i.e. in minimum necessary doses for testing with the nose.
      <br/>
      The components whereby may be atomized in the air under the nose of the user or, for example, on a strip of material which by tradition is dipped into the prepared mixture to be tested.
      <br/>
      Favorable variants which are found will have a formulation in accordance with which it is possible to prepare a perfume liquid according to the traditional procedure, after which a final correction is made.
    </p>
