    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The field of the present invention is the manufacture of carbonyl isothiocyanate derivatives.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention pertains to an improved process for preparing N-alkoxy(or aryloxy)carbonyl isothiocyanate derivatives, wherein the improvement comprises the presence of a N,N-dialkylarylamine as a catalyst in the reaction process, and the presence of an aqueous solvent in the reaction process.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">Derivatives of carbonyl isothiocyanates are well known in the art, and various methods for their production are also known in the art.</p>
    <p num="3">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,659,853 discloses a process for producing derivatives of alkoxy, aryloxy and alkene isothiocyanates by reacting a haloformate, an alkali, alkaline earth metal, lead or ammonium thiocyanate and a compound having the formula R1 --Y--H wherein R1 is an alkyl, aryl or alkoxy, Y is oxygen, sulfur or N--R2, and R2 is hydrogen or R1 ; in the presence of a solvent or water and a catalyst.
      <br/>
      Suitable catalysts include pyridine, quinoline, pyrimidine, pyrazine, quinoxaline and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,778,921 describes a process for the preparation of alkoxy and aryloxy isothiocyanates which includes the reaction of a haloformate and an alkali or alkaline earth metal thiocyanate in the presence of water and a catalyst.
      <br/>
      The catalyst comprises a six-membered mononuclear or ten-membered fused polynuclear aromatic, heterocyclic compound having one or two nitrogen atoms as the only hetero atoms in the ring.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,673 discloses a process for producing alkoxy and aryloxy isothiocyanates by the reaction of a haloformate and an alkali or alkaline earth metal thiocyanate in the presence of water and a catalyst.
      <br/>
      A co-catalyst is also used in the process to accelerate the reaction rate, increase product purity, and reduce the adverse effects of impurities in the thiocyanate reactants.

    <p num="6">
      In the publication, Chem.
      <br/>
      Ber. 116, 2044, (1983), it is reported that the use of an aromatic heterocyclic nitrogen catalyst such as pyridine in carbon tetrachloride produced an alkoxythiocarbonyl isothiocyanate wherein the yield was only about 52%.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The most prevalent prior art methods comprise (i) the formation of the carbonyl isothiocyanate, (ii) the recovery and purification thereof, and (iii) the final reaction thereof with the appropriate co-reactant to produce the desired derivative.
      <br/>
      However, the known methods result in carbonyl isothiocyanate of low yield and purity.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is a need in the art for a process to produce carbonyl isothiocyanate derivatives in high yield and purity.

      The process according to the invention is generally carried out at atmospheric pressure.
      <br/>
      The reaction of the chloroformate (formula I) with the thiocyanate (formula II) is carried out at a temperature of from about -10 (degree)  C. to about 40 (degree)  C.; and preferably at a temperature of from about 0 (degree)  C. to about 10 (degree)  C. The chloroformate is added to the reaction mixture at a rate such that the temperature of the reaction remains in the desired range.
      <br/>
      The reaction time for this step in the process of the invention is up to about 16 hours; and preferably the reaction time is from about 1 hour to about 4 hours.
      <br/>
      The progress of the reaction is monitored by liquid chromatography analysis of the reaction mixture to determine the amount of unreacted thiocyanate.
