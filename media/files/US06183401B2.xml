    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to exercise equipment and more particularly, to exercise equipment that uses a variable number of weights to resist exercise motion.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Exercise weight stacks are known in the art.
      <br/>
      Generally speaking, weights are arranged in a stack and movably mounted on guide rods.
      <br/>
      A selector rod is connected to a desired number of weights by means of a pin or another suitable connection method.
      <br/>
      The selector rod and any selected weights are typically connected to a force receiving member by means of a cable which moves the weights upward in response to exercise movement.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Although exercise weight stacks are prevalent in the exercise industry, they nonetheless suffer from certain shortcomings.
      <br/>
      For example, in order to provide a large amount of weight at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable amount of space, equipment manufacturers use a small number of relatively heavy weights.
      <br/>
      As a result, the amount of weight being lifted cannot be adjusted in small increments.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a relatively large number of lighter weights could be used in order to provide smaller increments in weight adjustment, but the resulting equipment would be quite expensive and/or bulky.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Attempts have been made to address the issue of incremental adjustments.
      <br/>
      One such effort involves the provision of a second, adjacent weight stack comprising weights which weigh a fraction of the weights in the other or primary stack.
      <br/>
      A problem with this approach is that it adds significantly to the cost of the equipment.
      <br/>
      Another effort involves the provision of a half-weight (or other fractional weight), which weighs one-half the weight of each weight in the stack, and which is selectively movable from a peg on the frame onto an aligned peg on the top plate of the stack.
      <br/>
      This approach not only creates a balance problem during movement of the selected weights, but it also increases the potential for injury due to the proximity of the two pegs and their movement relative to one another.

      Yet another prior art machine with supplemental weights is disclosed in French Patent No. 2,613,237 to Louvet.
      <br/>
      The Louvet machine includes a stack of primary weights movable along a guide rod in response to exercise movement, and a stack of secondary weights movable along the guide rod and selectively stored above the stack of primary weights.
      <br/>
      The secondary weights are supported by gates which are rotatably mounted on rigid frame members and which have pegs that rotate into engagement with holes in the frame members.
      <br/>
      Each of nine secondary weights has a mass equal to one-tenth the mass of one of the primary weights.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      One disadvantage of the Louvet machine is that nothing prevents a user from releasing a secondary weight without grasping the weight being released.
      <br/>
      As a result, the secondary weight may be free to drop downward onto the top plate in the stack of primary weights, thereby increasing the likelihood of personal injury and/or damage to the machine.
      <br/>
      Also, each of the secondary weights is not separately supported by a respective gate.
      <br/>
      As a result, the entire stack of secondary weights may be released at one time, with or without a user holding onto to any of the secondary weights.
      <br/>
      Yet another shortcoming of the Louvet machine is that nine secondary weights are required to provide nine levels of incremental weight adjustments.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Another limitation with many existing weight stack machines, including the Louvet machine, is that the amount of resistance is uniform throughout the range of exercise motion, whereas the user's strength typically varies as a function of muscle contraction and extension.
      <br/>
      One response to this problem has been to use eccentric cam members to vary the amount of leverage being exerted against a fixed amount of weight.
      <br/>
      However, room for other solutions and/or improvements remains.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      One aspect of the present invention is to provide an exercise apparatus with a supplemental weight movable along a connector interconnected between a top weight plate and a force receiving member.
      <br/>
      The top weight plate is mounted on a guide rod and movable between a lowermost position and an uppermost position.
      <br/>
      In a first mode of operation, the supplemental weight is supported by a frame member, and the connector and the top weight plate move relative to the supplemental weight and the frame.
      <br/>
      In a second mode of operation, the supplemental weight is supported by the top weight plate, and the supplemental weight moves together with the connector and the top weight plate relative to the frame.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      On one embodiment of the present invention, the frame member supports the supplemental weight at a position above the uppermost position of the top weight plate during the first mode of operation, and the supplemental weight is selectively movable onto the top weight plate to facilitate the second mode of operation.
      <br/>
      On another embodiment, the frame member supports the supplemental weight at a position between the uppermost and lowermost positions of the top weight plate during the first mode of operation, and the top weight plate is movable into contact with the supplemental weight to initiate the second mode of operation.
      <br/>
      The second embodiment may also be constructed to allow the supplemental weight to be moved to a rest position above the uppermost position of the top weight plate to limit operation to only the first mode of operation, and/or to allow the supplemental weight to be moved to a rest position on the top weight plate when in its lowermost position to facilitate "second mode" operation like on the first embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In other words, the present invention facilitates conventional weight stack resistance, fractionally increased weight stack resistance which remains constant throughout a range of motion, and/or fractionally increased weight stack resistance which varies during an exercise stroke.
      <br/>
      On certain embodiments of the present invention, multiple supplemental weights may be provided discrete amounts of mass, thereby allowing the user to choose between the mass of the first weight, the mass of the second weight, and the combined mass of the two weights.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The present invention also provides a variety of alternatives for positioning and/or selecting the supplemental weight(s).
      <br/>
      The various embodiments of the present invention store the supplemental weight(s) outside of harm's way yet prevent outright removal of the supplemental weight from the exercise equipment.
      <br/>
      Many of the features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the more detailed description that follows.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention provides methods and apparatus related to incremental adjustment of weight stack resistance.
      <br/>
      More specifically, an otherwise conventional weight stack machine is provided with supplemental weights which weigh a fraction of the weights in the stack and are selectively movable into the path of a weight plate of the stack and/or on top of the weight plate.
      <br/>
      The number and relative masses of the supplemental weights are a matter of design choice.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 1 shows a first weight stack machine 100 which has been modified in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The machine 100 includes a frame 110a designed to rest upon a floor surface.
      <br/>
      First and second guide rods 112a and 114a extend vertically between lower and upper ends of the frame 110a.
      <br/>
      A top plate 123a and underlying weight plates 120a are movably mounted on the guide rods 112a and 114a.
      <br/>
      When not in use, the plates 123a and 120a rest against a shock absorbing member 116a on the lower end of the frame 110a.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      A selector rod 130a extends through the plates 123a and 120a and is selectively connected to any desired plate 120a by a selector pin or other means known in the art.
      <br/>
      A cable 138a extends from an upper end of the selector rod 130a to one or more force receiving members which operate in a manner known in the art.
      <br/>
      As a result, movement of a force receiving member is resisted by gravity acting on the selected number of plates.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In accordance with the present invention, supplemental weights 150 and 150' are movably mounted on the guide rods 112a and 114a above the top plate 123a.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 2-3 (where the depicted guide rod 114a is representative of the other guide rod 112a), a pin 115 is rigidly secured to the guide rod 114a and extends perpendicular relative thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A hole 154 is formed through each of the weights 150 and 150' to accommodate one of the guide rods 112a or 114a.
      <br/>
      A transverse notch 157 is formed in the bottom of each weight 150 or 150' to engage the pin 115 when the weight 150 or 150' is oriented as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      A transverse slot 159, which extends perpendicular to the notch 157, is formed through each weight 150 or 150' to provide clearance for the pin 115 when the weight 150 or 150' is oriented as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The weight 150' shown in FIG. 1 was rotated ninety degrees relative to the weights 150 in order to descend the guide rod 114a.
      <br/>
      The top of each weight 150 or 150' may be provided with a ridge sized and configured to nest within the notch 157 and/or the slot 159 in an overlying weight 150.
      <br/>
      Such a ridge would cooperate with the notch 157 or the slot 159 to encourage simultaneous rotation of both the lower weight and the upper weight.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that the depicted embodiment 100 is capable of providing the same number and magnitude of resistance increments as the machine disclosed in French Patent No. 2,613,237, but with one-third fewer supplemental weights.
      <br/>
      In particular, if the three weights on the left-hand guide rod 112a include a one-half kilogram weight disposed between two one kilogram weights, and the three weights on the right-hand guide rod 114a includes a one kilogram weight disposed between two one-half kilogram weights, then various combinations of the six supplemental weights are available to provide weight adjustments between one-half kilogram and four and one-half kilograms, in increments of one-half kilogram (just like the nine supplemental weights on the Louvet machine).
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 4 shows a second weight stack machine 200 which has been modified in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The machine 200 similarly includes a weight stack, including top plate 123b, movably mounted on guide rods 112b and 114b.
      <br/>
      A selector rod 130b extends through the weight stack and is connected to a force receiving member by means of cable 138b.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Supplemental weights 251 and 252 are movably mounted on the guide rods 112b and 114b above the top plate 123b.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 5 (where the depicted weight 251 is a mirror image of the other weight 252), the weight 251 is a bar that has been bent or otherwise formed to interact with the guide rods 112b and 114b while avoiding the selector rod 130b and/or the cable 138b.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A first end 261 of the bar 251 forms a substantially closed loop which is interrupted by a slot 265 disposed between the end 261 and an intermediate segment 263.
      <br/>
      The loop bounds an opening 262 sufficient in size to accommodate the guide rod 112b.
      <br/>
      A central segment 264 of the bar 251 is interconnected transversely between the intermediate segment 263 and an opposite intermediate segment 266.
      <br/>
      The segments 263 and 266 are different lengths to space the segment 264 apart from the selector rod 130b and cable 138b.
      <br/>
      A notch 267 is formed in the underside of the segment 266, near the second, opposite end 268, for reasons explained below.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      When the weight 251 is arranged as shown in FIG. 4, the first end 261 rests upon a transversely extending pin 215 rigidly secured to the guide rod 112b, and the segment 266 rests upon a transversely extending hook 217 rigidly secured to the guide rod 114b.
      <br/>
      The hook 217 has a transversely extending shaft which nests inside the notch 267, and an upwardly extending end which discourages rotation of the weight 251 about the guide rod 112b.
      <br/>
      The weight 251 is lowered onto the top plate 123b by lifting the weight 251 off the hook 217 and rotating the weight 251 until the slot 265 aligns with the pin 215.
      <br/>
      An advantage of this embodiment (and certain other embodiments described herein) is that the mass of each of the weights 251 and 252 is relatively evenly distributed across the top plate 123b.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 6 shows a third weight stack machine 300 which has been modified in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The machine 300 similarly includes a weight stack, including top plate 123c, movably mounted on guide rods 112c and 114c.
      <br/>
      A selector rod 130c extends through the weight stack and is connected to a force receiving member by means of cable 138c.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Supplemental weights 350 are movably mounted on the guide rods 112c and 114c above the top plate 123c.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 7, each weight 350 is a bar that has been bent or otherwise formed to interact with the guide rods 112c and 114c and not interfere with the selector rod 130c and/or the cable 138c.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Each bar 350 may be described as a substantially closed loop having relatively short ends 352 and 354 and relatively long sides 356 and 358.
      <br/>
      Each loop is sized and configured to fit around both guide rods 112c and 114c.
      <br/>
      A hole 359 is formed in the front side 356 of the bar 350, proximate the relatively longer end 354, for reasons explained below.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      When the weight 350 is arranged as shown in FIG. 6, the second end 354 is supported by a transversely extending bolt 319 rigidly secured to the guide rod 114c, and the first end 352 rests against the guide rod 112c.
      <br/>
      The bolt 319 has a shaft which extends through the hole 359, and a larger diameter head which discourages rotation of the weight 350 about the guide rod 112c.
      <br/>
      The weight 350 is lowered onto the top plate 123c by lifting the weight 350 off the bolt 319 and rotating the weight 350 until the front side 356 clears the head of the bolt 319.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Supports 322 and 324 are provided on the top plate 123c to stabilize the weights 350 during exercise.
      <br/>
      The support 322 has a trapezoidal shape which engages the sides 356 and 358 to discourage movement of the end 352 toward the guide rod 114c, and the support 324 has a rectangular shape which engages the end 354 to discourage movement of the end 354 toward the guide rod 112c.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 8 shows a fourth weight stack machine 400 which has been modified in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The machine 400 similarly includes a weight stack, including top plate 123d, movably mounted on guide rods 112d and 114d.
      <br/>
      A selector rod 130d extends through the weight stack and is connected to a force receiving member by means of cable 138d.

    <p num="30">
      Supplemental weights 450 are movably mounted on the guide rods 112d and 114d above the top plate 123d.

      Also, a safety shield 401 is provided to substantially cover or enclose the moving parts of the apparatus 400.
      <br/>
      A slot 402 is provided in the shield 401 to facilitate manipulation of the supplemental weights 450.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 9, a shaft 452 is sized and configured to extend through the slot 402 and connect a respective weight 450 to a respective handle 451 disposed on the near side of the shield 401.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      A central hole 453 is formed through the weight 450 to provide clearance for the cable 138d.
      <br/>
      Smaller oval holes 454 are formed through the weight 450 to accommodate the guide rods 112d and 114d.
      <br/>
      Pins (not shown) extend transversely from respective guide rods 112d and 114d and toward one another.
      <br/>
      Transverse notches 457 are formed in the bottom of the weight 450 to engage the pins when the weight 450 occupies a first position relative to the guide rods 112d and 114d.
      <br/>
      Transverse slots 459 are formed through the weight 450 to accommodate the pins when the weight 450 occupies a second, transversely displaced position relative to the guide rods 112d and 114d.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Each weight 450 is lowered onto the top plate 123d by pulling the handle 451 toward the reader and allowing the weight 450 to descend.
      <br/>
      The shield 401 may be made to cooperate with the shaft 452 in a manner which controls descent of the weight 450 but does not interfere with ascent of the weight 450.
      <br/>
      Also, the weights 450 (as well as the weights on other embodiments) may be coated with a shock absorbing material or otherwise modified to reduce impact and/or noise during operation.

      <br/>
      A selector rod extends through the weight stack and is connected to a force receiving member by means of cable 138f.

      <br/>
      When lowered onto the top plate 123f, each weight 550 fits snugly about a block 625 on the top plate 123f.
      <br/>

      FIG. 16 shows an eighth weight stack machine 800 which has been modified in accordance with the principles of the present invention.

      The machine 800 similarly includes a weight stack, including top plate 123h, movably mounted on guide rods 112h and 114h.
      <br/>
      A selector rod 130h extends through the weight stack and is connected to a force receiving member by means of cable 138h.

      Supplemental weights 850a and 850b are selectively movable onto the top plate 123h along a path dictated by guide cords 812 and 814, which extend between the top plate 123h and an upper portion of the frame.
      <br/>
      The weights 850a and 850b are similar to the weights 750 shown in FIG. 15, except that (a) relatively larger spacers 859 are disposed on a top side of each weight 850a or 850b; (b) pegs 852 extend downward from the weight 850a to selectively engage holes extending downward into the top plate 123h; and (c) holes extend downward into the weight 850a (or the spacers 859 on the weight 850a) to selectively receive pegs extending downward from the weight 850b.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      For each of the weights 850a and 850b, a flexible cord 870 extends between the weight 850a or 850b and a respective spring-biased reel 880.
      <br/>
      A first end of each cord 870 is connected to a respective reel 880, and a second, opposite end of each cord 870 is connected to a respective weight 850a or 850b by means of a fastener 875.
      <br/>
      The spring force of the reel 880 is sufficiently strong to maintain the weight 850a or 850b in the raised position.
      <br/>
      The weight 850a, for example, is moved to the lowered position simply by pulling downward, as a latching mechanism 888 (such as a pivoting pawl, for example) releasably locks the reel 880 against rewinding.
      <br/>
      The latching mechanism 888 may be subsequently released to return the weight 850a upward.

      FIG. 17 shows a ninth weight stack machine 900 which has been modified in accordance with the principles of the present invention.

      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 18, the weight 950b (which is representative of the weight 950a) is U-shaped to occupy a balanced position relative to the top plate 123i, and to provide clearance for the selector rod 138i inside slot 953.

      Loop type fasteners 954 are mounted on an opposite side of the weight 950b to mate with hook type fasteners on the other plate 950a (which also has loop type fasteners on an opposite side, in case the two weights 950a and 950b are reversed).
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The tethers 923 are similar to telephone cords which form a helical coil when free of tension.

      The machine 100 similarly includes a weight stack, including top plate 123j, movably mounted on guide rods 112j and 114j.
      <br/>
      A selector rod 130j extends through the weight stack and is connected to a force receiving member by means of cable 138j.

      Supplemental weights 1050 are movably mounted on the guide rods 112j and 114j above the top plate 123j.

      Also, a safety shield 1001 is provided to substantially cover or enclose the moving parts of the apparatus 1000.
      <br/>
      A slot 1002 is provided in the shield 101 to facilitate manipulation of the supplemental weights 1050.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 20, a shaft 1052 is sized and configured to extend through the slot 1002 and connect a respective weight 1050 to a respective handle 1051 disposed on the near side of the shield 1001.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      A central hole 1053 is formed through the weight 1050 to provide clearance for the cable 138j.

      Smaller oval holes 1054 are formed through the weight 1050 to accommodate the guide rods 112j and 114j.
      <br/>
      Pins (not shown) extend transversely from respective guide rods 112j and 114j and toward one another.
      <br/>
      Transverse notches (not shown) are formed in the bottom of the weight 1050 to engage the pins when the weight 1050 occupies a first position relative to the guide rods 112j and 114j.
      <br/>
      Transverse slots 1059 are formed through the weight 1050 to accommodate the pins when the weight 1050 occupies a second, displaced position relative to the guide rods 112j and 114j.

    <p num="52">
      Each weight 1050 is lowered toward the top plate 123j by pulling the handle 1051 toward the reader and allowing the weight 1050 to descend.
      <br/>
      The slot 1002 does not extend all the way down to the lowermost position of the top plate 123j.
      <br/>
      Also, a frame member 1011 spans the rear of the machine 1000 and cooperates with a rearwardly extending pin 1055 on each weight 1050 to further limit downward movement of each weight 1050.
      <br/>
      As a result, each weight 1050 is movable into the path of the top plate 123j but is supported by the top plate 123j only after the latter has traveled upward a first distance.
      <br/>
      After the top plate 123j reaches the lower extent of the slot 1002, continued upward movement of the top plate 123j encounters additional resistance to the extent that any supplemental weights 1050 are within the path of the top plate 123j.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Like on the previously described machine 400, the shield 1001 may be made to cooperate with the shaft 1052 in a manner which controls descent of the weight 1050 but does not interfere with ascent of the weight 1050.
      <br/>
      Also, the weights 1050 (as well as the weights on other embodiments) may be coated with a shock absorbing material or otherwise modified to reduce impact and/or noise during operation.

      FIG. 21 shows an eleventh weight stack machine 1100 which has been modified in accordance with the principles of the present invention, and which combines aspects of the foregoing embodiment 1000 and the first embodiment 100.
      <br/>
      The machine 100 includes a frame 110k designed to rest upon a floor surface.
      <br/>
      First and second guide rods 112k and 114k extend vertically between lower and upper ends of the frame 110k.
      <br/>
      A top plate 123k and underlying weight plates 125k are movably mounted on both of the guide rods 112k and 114k.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      A selector rod 130k extends through the plates 123k and 125k and is selectively connected to any desired plate by a selector pin or other means known in the art.
      <br/>
      A cable 138k extends from an upper end of the selector rod 130k to one or more force receiving members which operate in a manner known in the art.
      <br/>
      As a result, movement of a force receiving member is resisted by gravity acting on the selected number of plates.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Supplemental weights 1150 are movably mounted on the guide rods 112k and 114k above the top plate 123a.
      <br/>
      The weights 1150 configured similar to the weights 150 shown in FIGS. 2-3. A hole is formed through each of the weights 1150 to accommodate one of the guide rods 112k or 114k.
      <br/>
      A transverse notch is formed in the bottom of each weight 1150, and a transverse slot, which extends perpendicular to the notch, is formed through each weight 1150.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Each weight 1150 is mounted on a respective guide rod 112k or 114k.
      <br/>
      A rigid pin 115k is rigidly secured to each guide rod 112k and 114k and extends radially outward from a respective guide rod 112k or 114k.
      <br/>
      When disposed above a respective pin 115k, either weight 1150 may be maneuvered relative to a respective guide rod 112k or 114k so that the groove in the weight 1150 aligns with the pin 115k and thereby biases the weight 1150 against movement relative to the guide rod 112k or 114k.
      <br/>
      From this position, either weight 1150 may be maneuvered relative to a respective guide rod 112k or 114k so that the slot in the weight 1150 aligns with the pin 115k and thereby provides clearance for the weight 1150 to move downward beneath the pin 115k and into the path of the top plate 123k.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Contrary to the weights 150 on the first embodiment 100, the weights 1150 are tethered to the frame by flexible strings 1160.
      <br/>
      A first end of each string 1160 is connected to a respective weight 1150, and a second, opposite end of each string 1160 is connected to a respective bolt 1116 on a frame member 1111.
      <br/>
      The lengths of the strings 1160 are such that the weights 150 cannot descend all the way down to the lowermost position of the top plate 123k.
      <br/>
      Rather, the top plate 123k encounters any "selected" supplemental weights 1150 only after traveling upward a first distance.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will also recognize that two weights (1150 or 150) with discrete masses provide three discrete resistance increments, including the mass of one weight, the mass of the other weight, and the combined mass of both weights.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will also recognize that similar weight suspending tether arrangements may be used on other embodiments disclosed herein.

      FIG. 22 shows a twelfth weight stack machine 1200 which has been modified in accordance with the principles of the present invention, and which is similar in many respects to the foregoing embodiment 1100 (as suggested by the common reference numerals).
      <br/>
      In fact, the only structural distinction regards the manner in which the weights 1150 are tethered.
      <br/>
      In particular, the twelfth embodiment 1200 has a single flexible line 1260 which extends from a first end, which is connected to one of the weights 1150, to an intermediate portion, which is disposed about the bolts 1116, to a second, opposite end, which is connected to the other weight 1150.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The length of the line 1260 is such that both weights 1150 cannot move to the lowermost position of the top plate 123k at the same time.
      <br/>
      As a result of this arrangement, either weight may be moved to the lowermost position, in which case, the other weight is available for descent only to an intermediate position along the path of the top plate 123k.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that a coupling must be established between the relatively lower weight 1150 and the top plate 123k if the relatively lower weight 1150 weighs less than the other weight 1150.
      <br/>
      For example, hook and loop fasteners, like those shown in FIG. 17, may be provided on the relatively lower weight 1150 and the top plate 123k.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      FIGS. 23-25 show a thirteenth weight stack machine 1300 which has been modified in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The machine 1300 similarly includes a weight stack, including top plate 123m, movably mounted on guide rods 112m and 114m.
      <br/>
      A connector or cable 138m is interconnected between the top plate 123m and a force receiving member.
      <br/>
      In a manner known in the art, a selector rod (not shown) extends through the weight stack and is rigidly secured to the top plate 123m by means of a bolt 124m.
      <br/>
      The selector rod is selectively connected to underlying weight plates 125m by means of a selector pin (not shown) inserted through a respective hole 126m.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      In the absence of tension in the cable 138m, the top weight plate occupies a lowermost position relative to the frame 110m.
      <br/>
      In response to a sufficiently large pulling force on the cable 138m, the top weight plate 123m moves upward to an uppermost position (which may be determined by stop 1313 on guide rod 112m, for example).
      <br/>
      A supplemental weight 1350 is selectively movable along the cable 138m from a rest position on a frame member 1380 (above the uppermost position of the top weight plate 123m), to a rest position on a frame member 1370 (between the uppermost and lowermost positions of the top weight plate 123m), to a rest position on the top weight plate 123m (at the lowermost position of the top weight plate 123m).
      <br/>
      The cable 138m extends through a central opening 1358 in the weight 1350, and the weight 1350 may be described as forming a substantially closed loop about the cable 138m (to the exclusion of the guide rods 112m and 114m).
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The weight 1350 includes an upwardly disposed block 1351 and a downwardly disposed plate 1352 which are interconnected by helical coil springs 1353.
      <br/>
      The block 1351 constitutes the majority of the mass on the weight 1350, and the plate 1352 is configured to interface with the top weight plate 123m.
      <br/>
      In particular, cavities or depressions are formed in the downwardly facing side of the plate 1352 to receive the upwardly tapered nubs 1325 on the top plate 123m when the weight 1350 is oriented as shown in FIG. 26 or rotated ninety degrees about the cable 138m.
      <br/>
      Both the downwardly opening cavities and the alternative orientation of the weight are shown in FIGS. 26-27 with reference to an alternative weight 1450.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The frame member 1380 includes two adjacent U-shaped bars which are configured generally as shown in FIG. 23, and which are spaced relative to one another (and the weight 1350) as shown in FIGS. 24-25. As a result, when the weight 1350 is oriented as shown in FIG. 24, it is free to move past the frame member 1380, and when the weight is oriented as shown in FIG. 25, it is captured or blocked by the frame member 1380.
      <br/>
      The spatial relationship between the frame member 1380 and the frame 110m is such that the springs 1353 must be compressed in order to move the weight 1350 into and out of the position shown in dashed lines in FIG. 23. As a result of this arrangement, the weight 1350 is maintained in a safe and quiet storage location when not in use; a user must handle the weight 1350 in order to lower to an operative location; and the weight 1350 is connected to the apparatus 1300 without engaging the guide rods 112m and 114m.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The frame member 1370 includes a single bar formed into a generally rectangular configuration, having two "contoured" sides like the portion shown in FIG. 23 and two linear sides which extend through the frame 110m.
      <br/>
      The spacing between the two contoured sides of the frame member 1370 is similar to the spacing of the two bars which form the frame member 1380, and thus, the weight 1350 is similarly maneuverable relative thereto.
      <br/>
      Each of the two contoured sides of the frame member 1370 has a straight central portion 1375 bounded at opposite ends by guides or humps 1377.
      <br/>
      This arrangement is designed to support the weight 1350 in an aligned position relative to the top weight plate 123m.
      <br/>
      The sides of the plate 1352 cooperate with the humps 1377 to "center" the weight 1350 in a direction parallel to the central portions 1375, and grooves in the underside of the plate 1352 cooperate with the central portions 1375 to "center" the weight 1350 in a direction perpendicular to the central portions 1375.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      An optional means may be provided for purposes of adjusting the rest position established by the frame member 1370.
      <br/>
      For example, openings 1317 may be provided in the vertical frame members 1310 (in the manner shown in FIG. 23) to accommodate vertical movement of the straight sides of the frame member 1370 and to support same at a plurality of vertically displaced locations.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the openings 1317 could be extended all the way up the frame members 1310, thereby eliminating the need for a separate frame member 1380.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      In operation, the apparatus 1300 facilitates multiple modes of operation.
      <br/>
      For example, when the weight 1350 occupies the position shown in dashed lines in FIG. 23, the apparatus 1300 functions like a conventional weight stack machine.
      <br/>
      If the weight 1350 is moved to the position shown in solid lines in FIG. 23, the amount of weight resistance increases in the middle of an exercise stroke.
      <br/>
      In other words, the user is lifting the weight of the conventional stack until the top weight plate 123m moves upward into contact with the supplemental weight 1350.
      <br/>
      During this contact phase, the springs 1353 absorb energy and/or reduce impact of the top weight plate 123m against the supplemental weight 1350 to provide a relatively smooth transition into a relatively greater amount of weight resistance.
      <br/>
      After the weight 1350 is lifted from the frame member 1370 (and supported by the top weight plate 123m), the user is lifting the weight of the conventional weight stack and the supplemental weight 1350.
      <br/>
      In the alternative, if the weight 1350 is lowered onto the top plate 123m (when the latter occupies its lowermost position), the user is lifting the weight of the conventional stack and the supplemental weight 1350 through the range of exercise motion.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      FIGS. 26-27 show a fourteenth weight stack machine 1400 which has been modified in accordance with the principles of the present invention (and is similar in many respects to the previous embodiment 1300).
      <br/>
      The machine 1400 similarly includes a weight stack, including top weight plate 123m, movably mounted on guide rods 112n and 114n.
      <br/>
      A connector or cable 138n is interconnected between the top weight plate 123m and a force receiving member 140n.
      <br/>
      The cable 138n is routed about a couple of pulleys 139n so that downward and/or outward movement of the force receiving member 140n causes upward movement of the top weight plate 123m.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The apparatus 1400 includes two supplemental weights 1450 and 1460, each of which may be described as a simple block or unitary member.
      <br/>
      The two weights 1450 and 1460 are identical except for upwardly tapered nubs 1456 which are provided only on top of the lower weight 1450.
      <br/>
      These nubs 1456 interact with the upper weight 1460 in the same manner as the nubs 1325 on the top weight plate 123m interact with the lower weight 1450.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 27, four inwardly tapered cavities or depressions 1455 are provided in the downwardly facing surface of the weight 1450 (and the weight 1460) to interengage the nubs 1325 (or the nubs 1456).
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      A central opening 1458 extends through each of the weights 1450 and 1460, and the cable 138n extends through the openings 1458.
      <br/>
      Each of the weights 1450 and 1460 may also be described as forming a substantially closed loop about the cable 138n (to the exclusion of the guide rods 112n and 114n).

      Grooves 1457 are provided in the downwardly facing surface of the weight 1450 (and the weight 1460) to interengage with either the frame member 1370 or the frame member 1480.
      <br/>
      Each of the grooves 1457 is relatively deeper along a line extending vertically through the groove in FIG. 27. The flared ends of the grooves 1457 guide the weights 1450 and 1460 into proper alignment with a respective frame member 1370 or 1480.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The apparatus 1400 is depicted with the same adjustable frame member 1370 as the previous embodiment 1300.
      <br/>
      On either embodiment, the frame member 1370 could be provided with one or more downwardly extending bars to discourage rotation of the supplemental weight(s) into an orientation other than that shown for the weight 1450 in FIG. 26. A different upper frame member 1480 is provided in order to accommodate the two weights 1450 and 1460 and provide clearance for the central pulley 139n.
      <br/>
      The frame member 1480 has the same general configuration as the frame member 1380 on the previous embodiment 1300, but with an additional ledge or shelf 1486 for the additional weight 1460, and additional clearance for maneuvering each of the weights 1450 and 1460 into and out of engagement.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The top weight plate 123m is shown in its lowermost position, and it is movable to an uppermost position (which is determined by stop 1415 on the frame 110n).
      <br/>
      The frame member 1480 is disposed above the uppermost position, and the frame member 1370 is disposed between the uppermost position and the lowermost position.
      <br/>
      The existence of multiple supplemental weights 1450 and 1460 allows this embodiment 1400 to function in yet another mode of operation, wherein the user lifts the weight of the conventional weight stack and the supplemental weight 1450 through the entire range of exercise motion, and the amount of weight increases during the exercise stroke.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      FIGS. 28-29 show a fifteenth weight stack machine 1500 which has been modified in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The machine 1500 similarly includes a weight stack, including top plate 123p, movably mounted on guide rods 112p and 114p.
      <br/>
      A connector or cable 138p is interconnected between the top plate 123p and the force receiving member 140n in the same manner as on the previous embodiment 1400.
      <br/>
      In a manner known in the art, a selector rod (not shown) extends through the weight stack and is rigidly secured to the top plate 123p by means of a bolt 124p.
      <br/>
      The selector rod is selectively connected to underlying weight plates 125p by means of a selector pin (not shown) inserted through a respective hole 126p.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      In the absence of tension in the cable 138p, the top weight plate occupies a lowermost position relative to the frame 110p.
      <br/>
      In response to a sufficiently large pulling force on the cable 138p, the top weight plate 123p moves upward to an uppermost position (which may be determined by stop 1515 on the frame 110p, for example).
      <br/>
      A supplemental weight 1550 is selectively movable along the cable 138p from a removed position (supported by a cable 1590 above the uppermost position of the top weight plate 123p), to any of several intermediate positions (supported by the cable 1590 between the uppermost and lowermost positions of the top weight plate 123p), to a lowermost position (resting on the top weight plate 123p when the latter is at its lowermost position).
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The support cable 1590 extends from a first end, connected to a fastener 118p on the frame 110p, to a first intermediate portion disposed about a pulley 1559 on the weight 1550 (and supported by another fastener 119p on the frame 110p), to a second intermediate portion disposed about a pulley 139p on the frame 110p, to a second end, connected to a detent pin 1595.
      <br/>
      The detent pin 1595 is inserted into any one of several holes along the frame member 1510.
      <br/>
      A stop 1599 is mounted on the first intermediate portion of the cable 1590, proximate the first end of the cable 1590, to limit upward travel of the weight 1550.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The weight 1550 includes an upwardly disposed block 1551 and a downwardly disposed plate 1552 which are interconnected by a rubber bumper 1553.
      <br/>
      The block 1551 constitutes the majority of the mass on the weight 1550, and the plate 1552 is configured to interface with the top weight plate 123p.
      <br/>
      In particular, the plate 1552 is downwardly tapered in order to readily align with an upwardly tapering cavity or depression 1522 in the top plate 123p.
      <br/>
      A bracket 1557 extends upward from the block 1551 to support the pulley 1559.
      <br/>
      A hole 1558 extends through both the block 1551 and the plate 1552 to receive the cable 138p, and form is a substantially closed loop about the cable 138p.
      <br/>
      On this embodiment 1500, the weight 1500 could be configured to surround and/or travel along the guide rods 112p and 114p, as well, since the weight 1550 is not subject to rotation.
      <br/>
      The positioning of the opening 1558 and the pulley 1559 on the weight 1550 is a matter of design choice, which may be influenced by both a desire to center the mass of the weight 1550 relative to the center of the top weight plate 123p, and a desire to center the mass of the weight 1550 relative to the longitudinal axis of the cable 138p.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      On all of the embodiments 1300, 1400, and 1500, the openings through the supplemental weights are significantly larger in diameter than the diameter of the connecting cable to facilitate movement of one relative to the other.
      <br/>
      On the last embodiment 1500, the relationship between the supplemental weight 1550 and the connector cable 138p is more critical because no stationary support is provided for the weight 1550.
      <br/>
      As a result, contact is likely to occur between the suspended weight 1550 and the cable 138p.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the balance of the weight 1550, the size of the opening 1558, and the selection of the interfacing materials on the weight 1550 and the cable 138p are significant design considerations.
      <br/>
      One possibility is to use a plastic coated cable for the cable 138p, and chromed steel for the weight 1550.
      <br/>
      Another possibility is to use a bare steel cable for the cable 138p, and UHMW plastic for the weight 1550 (or at least the walls disposed about the opening 1558 through the weight 1550).
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      This last embodiment 1500 may be viewed as advantageous because it requires fewer additional frame members and offers significant convenience, safety, and/or flexibility in the positioning of the weight 1550 relative to the top weight plate 123p.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the design of the apparatus 1500 is suitable for simple conversion between different types of machines, depending upon the preferences of the designer.
      <br/>
      For example, the pin locations along the frame member 1510 may be limited in such a manner that fractional resistance increase is available only throughout the range of exercise motion; or the pin locations may be such that fractional resistance increase is available only during an exercise stroke; and/or both pin locations may be available to facilitate both modes of operation.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The present invention may also be described in terms of methods.
      <br/>
      For example, the present invention may be said to provide a method of adjusting weight resistance to exercise.
      <br/>
      In this regard, a frame is provided with a first guide rod and a second guide rod, and a radially extending, rigid support on each said guide rod.
      <br/>
      A stack of primary weights is movably mounted on each said guide rod beneath each said support.
      <br/>
      A secondary weight is movably mounted on only the first guide rod, and a secondary weight movably mounted on only the second guide rod.
      <br/>
      The secondary weight on the first guide rod is selectively maneuvered out of engagement with the support on the first guide rod and downward onto an uppermost weight in the stack.
      <br/>
      The secondary weight on the second guide rod is selectively maneuvered out of engagement with the support on the second guide rod and downward onto the uppermost weight in the stack.
      <br/>
      In this way, a user may selectively add the mass of either said secondary weight or the combined mass of each said secondary weight to the uppermost weight in the stack.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      In another such method, a frame is provided with first and second guide rods, each having a support extending radially therefrom proximate an upper end thereof.
      <br/>
      A stack of primary weights is movably mounted on both of the guide rods beneath each said support.
      <br/>
      A first supplemental weight is movably mounted on the first of the guide rods.
      <br/>
      A second supplemental weight is movably mounted on the second of the guide rods.
      <br/>
      The first supplemental weight is selectively moved from a first location, overlying a respective support, to a second location, beneath the respective support and within a path traversed by an uppermost weight in the stack.
      <br/>
      The second supplemental weight is selectively moved from a first location, overlying a respective support, to a second location, beneath the respective support and within the path traversed by the uppermost weight in the stack.
      <br/>
      As a result, the individual mass of either said supplemental weight, as well as the combined mass of each said supplemental weight, is available to be added to the uppermost weight in the stack.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      Yet another such method involves providing a frame with a first guide rod, a second guide rod, and at least one rigid support proximate an upper end of each said guide rod.
      <br/>
      A stack of primary weights is movably mounted on both the first guide rod and the second guide rod beneath each said rigid support.
      <br/>
      A first supplemental weight is movably mounted on only the first guide rod.
      <br/>
      A second supplemental weight is movably mounted on only the second guide rod.
      <br/>
      The first supplemental weight is selectively maneuvered, independent of the second supplemental weight, relative to the first guide rod, out of engagement with the rigid support, and downward toward an uppermost weight in the stack.
      <br/>
      The second supplemental weight is selectively maneuvered, independent of the first supplemental weight, relative to the second guide rod, out of engagement with the rigid support, and downward toward the uppermost weight in the stack.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      In still another method of adjusting weight resistance to exercise, a frame is provided with a first guide rod having a first rigid support which is rigidly secured to the first guide rod and extends radially outward from the first guide rod, and with a second guide rod having a second rigid support which is rigidly secured to the second guide rod and extends radially outward from the second guide rod.
      <br/>
      A stack of weight plates, including a top plate, is mounted on both the first guide rod and the second guide rod for movement between a lowermost position and an uppermost position beneath both the first rigid support and the second rigid support.
      <br/>
      A connector is interconnected between a force receiving member and a desired number of plates in the stack.
      <br/>
      A first supplemental weight is mounted on at least the first guide rod for movement along the first guide rod.
      <br/>
      A second supplemental weight is mounted on at least the second guide rod for movement along the second guide rod.
      <br/>
      The first supplemental weight is selectively maneuvered from a first upper position, resting on the first rigid support, to a first lower position, disposed entirely beneath the first rigid support.
      <br/>
      The second supplemental weight is selectively maneuvered from a second upper position, resting on the second rigid support, to a second lower position, disposed entirely beneath the second rigid support.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      In yet another such method, a frame is provided with an interior space bounded by a shield.
      <br/>
      A stack of weight plates, including a top plate, is movable relative to the frame between a lowermost position and an uppermost position inside the interior space.
      <br/>
      A connector is interconnected between a force receiving member, disposed outside the interior space, and a desired number of plates in the stack.
      <br/>
      A supplemental weight is disposed above the stack and movable relative to the frame between a first position and a second position inside the interior space, wherein the first position is above the uppermost position, and the second position is beneath the uppermost position.
      <br/>
      A handle is connected to the supplemental weight and movable relative to the frame between a first position and a second position outside the interior space.
      <br/>
      The handle is selectively moved from the first position to the second position outside the interior space in order to move the supplemental weight from the first position to the second position inside the interior space.

    <p num="84">
      The present invention may also be described in terms of a method of using mass to resist motion on an exercise apparatus.
      <br/>
      In this regard, a frame is provided with a guide rod, and a top weight plate is movable along the guide rod between a lowermost position and an uppermost position.
      <br/>
      A supplemental weight is provided above the top weight plate and is movable from a first rest position to a second rest position, wherein the first rest position is above the uppermost position, and the second rest position is below the uppermost position.
      <br/>
      A connector extends through the supplemental weight and is interconnected between the top weight plate and a force receiving member.
      <br/>
      The supplemental weight is selectively moved from the first rest position to the second rest position in order to increase resistance to movement of the top weight plate to the uppermost position.
      <br/>
      An energy absorber may be provided in series between the top weight plate and at least a portion of the supplemental weight.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The foregoing method facilitates different modes of exercise under different circumstances.
      <br/>
      For example, the moving step may involve lowering the supplemental weight onto the top weight plate, in which case the weight resistance is incrementally increased through the range of exercise motion.
      <br/>
      The top weight plate and the supplemental weight may be provided with complementary portions, such that the moving step brings the complementary portions into engagement with one another.
      <br/>
      In the alternative, the moving step may involve freeing the supplemental weight from the frame at the first rest position and securing the supplemental weight to the frame at the second rest position, in which case the weight resistance increases incrementally during the exercise stroke.
      <br/>
      The supplemental weight and the frame may be provided with complementary portions, such that the moving step brings the complementary portions into engagement with one another.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the top weight plate and the supplemental weight may be provided with complementary portions, such that movement of the top weight plate toward the uppermost position brings the complementary portions into engagement with one another.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the location of the second rest position may be selectively adjusted relative to the top weight plate.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Another useful method similarly involves the provision of a frame with a guide rod, a top weight plate movable along the guide rod between a lowermost position and an uppermost position, and a connector interconnected between the top weight plate and a force receiving member.
      <br/>
      A supplemental weight is provided on the frame at a rest position above the top weight plate and below the uppermost position.
      <br/>
      Force is exerted against the force receiving member to move the top weight plate upward from the lowermost position, into contact with the supplemental weight, and upward beyond the rest position.
      <br/>
      An energy absorber may be provided in series between the top weight plate and at least a portion of the supplemental weight.
      <br/>
      The method may further involve selective movement of the supplemental weight to a removed position, supported by the frame above the uppermost position.
      <br/>
      The interengaging members may be provided with complementary portions, and/or the rest position may be selectively adjusted, as in the previous method.

      The present invention may also be described in terms of an exercise apparatus, comprising a frame having a guide rod; a top weight plate movably connected to the guide rod; a connector interconnected between the top weight plate and a force receiving member; and a supplemental weight movably connected to the connector and alternately supported by the frame and the top weight plate.
      <br/>
      The connector moves relative to the supplemental weight when the supplemental weight is supported by the frame, and the supplemental weight moves together with the connector and the top weight plate when the supplemental weight is supported by the top weight plate.

      The present invention may also be described in terms of an exercise apparatus, comprising a frame having a guide rod; a top weight plate movably mounted on the guide rod; a connector interconnected between the top weight plate and a force receiving member; a supplemental weight disposed above the top weight plate and forming a substantially closed loop about the connector; and a means, mounted on the frame, for selectively combining the supplemental weight and the top weight plate.
      <br/>
      The means supports the supplemental weight at a distance above the top weight plate in a first mode of operation, and the means allows the supplemental weight to be supported by the top weight plate in a second mode of operation.

      The foregoing description and/or the claims set forth below use certain terms which should be construed along the following lines to the extent necessary to overcome any relevant prior art.
      <br/>
      The lowermost and uppermost positions of the top plate in the weight stack are defined with reference to all parts and/or portions which are rigidly secured thereto.
      <br/>
      The space defined between these positions is bordered vertically by the positions themselves and horizontally by the planform of the top plate.
      <br/>
      The substantially fixed path which is said to be traversed by the supplemental weight(s) is limited in length to the height of the machine and includes the lowermost and uppermost positions of the top plate.
      <br/>
      The substantially closed loop which is said to be formed about the cable and/or one or more guide rods includes any closed curve not having a break or gap greater in width than the part(s) enclosed within the curve.
