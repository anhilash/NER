    <p num="1">This is a divisional application of U.S. Ser. No. 08/677,682, filed Jul. 8, 1996 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,855,726.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a vacuum processing apparatus; and more particularly, the invention relates to a vacuum processing apparatus which is suitable for performing treatment, such as etching, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), spattering, ashing, rinsing or the like, on a sample a semiconductor substrate, such as a Si substrate, and to a semiconductor manufacturing line for manufacturing semiconductor devices using the vacuum processing apparatus.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Basically, a vacuum processing apparatus is composed of a cassette block and a vacuum processing block.
      <br/>
      The cassette block has a front facing the bay path of the semiconductor manufacturing line and extending toward the longitudinal direction of the semiconductor manufacturing line, an alignment unit for aligning the orientation of a cassette for a sample or the orientation of a sample, and a robot operating under an atmospheric pressure environment.
      <br/>
      The vacuum block has a load lock chamber in the loading side, a load lock chamber in the unloading side, a processing chamber, a post treating chamber, a vacuum pump and a robot operating under a vacuum environment.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In the vacuum processing apparatus, a sample extracted from the cassette in the cassette block is transferred to the load lock chamber of the vacuum processing block by the atmospheric transfer robot.
      <br/>
      The sample is further transferred to the processing chamber from the load lock chamber by the atmospheric transfer robot and is set on an electrode structure body to be subjected to processing, such as plasma treatment.
      <br/>
      Then, the sample is transferred to the post treating chamber to be processed, if necessary.
      <br/>
      The sample having been processed is transferred to the cassette in the cassette block by the vacuum transfer robot and the atmospheric transfer robot.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Vacuum processing apparatuses for performing plasma etching on a sample are disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Publication No. 61-8153, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 63-133532, Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-30369, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-314729, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-314730, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,314, 509.</p>
    <p num="6">
      In the referenced above conventional vacuum processing apparatuses, the processing chambers and the load lock chambers are concentrically arranged or arranged in rectangular shape.
      <br/>
      For example, in the apparatus disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,509, a vacuum transfer robot is arranged near the center of the vacuum processing block with three processing chambers being concentrically arranged around the vacuum transfer robot, and a load lock chamber in the loading side and a load lock chamber in the unload side are provided between the vacuum transfer robot and the cassette block.
      <br/>
      In these apparatuses, there is a problem in that the required installation area of the whole apparatus is large since the rotating angles of the transfer arms of the atmospheric transfer robot and the vacuum transfer robot are large.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      On the other hand, the processing chamber in the vacuum processing block and the vacuum pump and other various kinds of piping components of the vacuum processing apparatus require maintenance, such as scheduled and unscheduled inspection or repairing.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in general, there are provided doors around the vacuum processing block so that inspection and repairing of the load lock chamber, the un-load lock chamber, the processing chamber, the vacuum transfer robot and the various kinds of piping components can be performed by opening the doors.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In the conventional vacuum processing apparatus, there is a problem in that the installation area is large even though the sample to be handled has a diameter d smaller than 8 inches (nearly 200 mm) and the outer size of the cassette Cw is nearly 250 mm.
      <br/>
      Further, in the case of handling a large diameter sample having a diameter d above 12 inches (nearly 300 mm), the size of the cassette Cw becomes nearly 350 mm.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the width of the cassette block containing a plurality of cassettes becomes large.
      <br/>
      If the width of the vacuum processing block is determined based on the width of the cassette block, the whole vacuum processing apparatus requires a large installation area.
      <br/>
      Considering a cassette block containing four cassettes as an example, the width of the cassette block cannot help but increase at least by nearly 40 cm when the diameter d of a sample increases from 8 inches to 12 inches.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      On the other hand, in a general semiconductor manufacturing line, in order to process a large amount of samples and employ various kinds of processes, a plurality of vacuum processing apparatuses performing the same processing are gathered in a bay, and transmission of samples between bays is performed automatically or manually.
      <br/>
      Since such a semiconductor manufacturing line requires a high cleanness, the whole semiconductor manufacturing line is installed in a large clean room.
      <br/>
      An increase in the size of a vacuum processing apparatus due to an increase in diameter of a sample to be processed results in an increase in the required installation area of the clean room, which further increases the construction cost of the clean room which by its nature already has a high construction cost.
      <br/>
      If vacuum processing apparatuses requiring a larger installation area are installed in a clean room having the same area, a reduction in the total number of the vacuum processing apparatuses or a decrease in the spacing between the vacuum processing apparatuses becomes inevitable.
      <br/>
      A reduction in the total number of the vacuum processing apparatuses in the clean room having the same area decreases the productivity of the semiconductor manufacturing line and increases the manufacturing cost of the semiconductor devices as an inevitable consequence.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a decrease in the spacing between the vacuum processing apparatuses decreases the maintainability of the vacuum processing apparatus due to lack of maintenance space for inspection and repair.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">An object of the present invention is to provide a vacuum processing apparatus which is capable of coping with larger diameter samples while keeping the manufacturing cost to a minimum.</p>
    <p num="11">Another object of the present invention is to provide a vacuum processing apparatus which is capable of coping with larger diameter samples and at the same time having a better maintainability.</p>
    <p num="12">A further object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor manufacturing line which is capable of coping with larger diameter samples while keeping manufacturing cost to a minimum by keeping the necessary number of vacuum processing apparatuses, through more economical use of space and at the same time not decreasing the maintainability.</p>
    <p num="13">
      In order to attain the above objects, the present invention provide a vacuum processing apparatus composed of a cassette block and a vacuum processing block, and the cassette block has a cassette table for mounting a cassette containing a sample, and the vacuum processing block has a processing chamber for treating the sample and a vacuum transfer means for transferring the sample.
      <br/>
      In the vacuum processing apparatus, both of the plan views of the cassette block and the vacuum processing block are nearly rectangular and the relation W1 -W2 &gt;= Cw is satisfied, where W1 is the width of the cassette block, W2 is the width of the vacuum processing block, and Cw is the width of one cassette.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Another characteristic of the present invention is that the width of the cassette block is designed to be larger than the width of the vacuum processing block, and the plan view of the vacuum processing apparatus is formed in an L-shape or a T-shape.</p>
    <p num="15">
      A further characteristic of the present invention is that a semiconductor manufacturing line comprising a plurality of bay areas having a plurality of vacuum processing apparatuses composed of a cassette block and a vacuum processing block are arranged in the order of the manufacturing process, and the cassette block has a cassette table for mounting a cassette containing a sample, and the vacuum processing block has a process chamber for performing vacuum processing on to the sample and a vacuum transfer means for transferring the sample.
      <br/>
      In the semiconductor manufacturing line, at least one of the vacuum processing apparatuses is designed so that the cassette block is capable of containing a sample having a diameter not less than 300 mm, and the relation W1 -W2 &gt;= Cw is satisfied, where W1 is the width of the cassette block, W2 is the width of the vacuum processing block, and Cw is the width of one cassette.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      A still further characteristic of the present invention is that a method of constructing a semiconductor manufacturing line which comprises a plurality of vacuum processing apparatuses composed of a cassette block capable of containing a sample having a diameter not less than 300 mm, and a vacuum processing block for performing vacuum processing on said sample.
      <br/>
      In the method of constructing a semiconductor manufacturing line, at least one of the vacuum processing apparatuses is designed so that the width of the cassette block is larger than the width of the vacuum processing block; the plane view of the vacuum processing apparatus is formed in an L-shape or a T-shape; and a maintenance space is provided between the L-shaped or the T-shaped vacuum processing apparatuses and the adjacent vacuum processing apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      According to the present invention, the view shapes of the cassette block and the vacuum processing block are rectangular, and the cassette block and the vacuum processing block are designed so that the relation W1 &gt;W2 is satisfied, where W1 is the width of the cassette block and W2 is the width of the vacuum processing block.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the plan view of the whole of the vacuum processing apparatus becomes L-shaped or T-shaped.
      <br/>
      In a case of arranging many such vacuum processing apparatuses, a sufficient space can be provided between the vacuum processing blocks positioned adjacent to each other, even if the interval between the vacuum processing blocks is made small.
      <br/>
      For example, when W1 is 1.5 m and W2 is 0.8 m, a maintenance space of 0.7 m can be provided between the vacuum processing apparatuses located adjacent to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Therefore, in spite of a larger diameter sample, the number of vacuum processing apparatuses installed in a clean room, having the same area as a conventional clean room, does not need to be reduced.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the productivity of the semiconductor manufacturing line does not decrease.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to provide a vacuum processing apparatus which can cope with a larger diameter sample and, at the same time, can suppress any increase in the manufacturing cost, and has better maintainability.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Further, by employing the vacuum processing apparatus according to the present invention in a semiconductor manufacturing line, it is possible to provide a semiconductor manufacturing line which can cope with a larger diameter sample while keeping manufacturing cost to a minimum by keeping the necessary number of vacum processing apparatuses, through more economical use of space and, at the same time, without decreasing the maintainability.</p>

    <p num="39">After completion of this operation, the in-bay automatic transfer machine transfers the recovered cassette 12 to the bay stoker 208, and stops its operation and stands by until the next demand signal is output from a vacuum processing apparatus 100 in the bay 200.</p>
    <p num="40">When demand signals are output from plural vacuum processing apparatuses 100, 100, . . . in the bay 200 within a short time, it depends on the system design whether the in-bay automatic transfer machine transfers samples according to the time sequence of the received signals, or in an order to achieve a higher transfer efficiency from the stand-by position of the in-bay automatic transfer machine 202 taking account of the relationship between the time difference in the demand signals and the positions of signal output apparatuses.</p>

      In the cassette block 1, three to four cassettes are placed side by side on a plane in the same level.

      In such a state, the state of samples of, the for example, the cassette 12A is checked by a wafer check means (not shown).
      <br/>
      In this case, the cassette 12A has a function to store samples in vertical direction one-by-one.

      As the wafer check means used, there in an arrangement where a sensor is successively moved so as to the position of successive correspond to sample containing stages of the cassette 12A, and another arrangement where plural sensors are provided corresponding to respective sample containing stages of the cassette 12A.
      <br/>
      In the latter arrangement, there is no need to provide a means for moving a sensor to sample containing stages of the cassette 12A.

      On the other hand, it may be possible to fix the sensor for the wafer check means and move the cassette 12A instead.

      Using the wafer check means, it is determined in which positions in the vertical direction of the cassette 12A the unprocessed samples are contained.

      For example, in a case where the wafer check means is the type in which a sensor is successively moved so as to correspond to the position of successive sample containing stages of the cassette 12A, the sensor detects a sample containing stage of the cassette 12A and the presence or absence of a unprocessed sample in the stage while the sensor is moving, for example, upward from the lower position of the cassette 12A, or downward from the upper position of the cassette 12A.

    <p num="49">
      The check results are output from the wafer check means to be input to and stored in, for example, a host computer (not shown in the figure) of the semiconductor manufacturing line controller for managing all of the vacuum processing apparatuses.

      Then, in this embodiment, the atmospheric transfer robot 9 is started to operate.
      <br/>
      By operation of the atmospheric transfer robot 9, one of the unprocessed samples in the cassette 12A is extracted out of the cassette 12A.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The atmospheric transfer robot 9 has a scooping-up device for scooping up and holding the surface of a sample opposite (reverse) to the surface to be processed.
      <br/>
      The scooping-up devices used are a device which adheres to and holds the reverse side surface of the sample, a device having grooves or indented portions for holding the sample, and a device mechanically gripping the peripheral portion of the sample.
      <br/>
      Further, as for a device adhering to and holding the reverse side surface of the sample, there are devices operation with the use of vacuum sucking adhesion and electrostatic attraction.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      In a case of using the device adhering and holding the reverse side surface of the sample having a diameter of 300 mm (12"), it is important to select the arrangement and the dimension of the adhering portion so as to minimize bending of the sample as much as possible.
      <br/>
      For example, the interval between the adhering portions is set to d/3 to d/2 taking the center of the sample as the center, where d is the diameter of the sample.
    </p>
    <p num="53">Depending on the amount of bending and the type of bending of the sample, displacement of the sample occurs when the sample is transferred between the scooping-up device and another transfer means, which sometimes causes an undesirable displacement of the orientation of the sample.</p>
    <p num="54">
      Further, in a case of using a device for adhering to and holding the reverse side surface of the sample, the adhering force is required to have a sufficient strength that the sample is not detached by the inertia force acting on the sample when the sample is being transferred, including the forces encountered during starting and stopping.
      <br/>
      If this condition is not satisfied, the sample may fall from the scooping-up device or a displacement of the orientation of the sample is likely to occur.

      By lowering the cassette 12A or lifting the scooping-up device, the unprocessed sample is transferred to the scooping-up device while the sample is kept in a scooped state.

      Such an embodiment has the following usefulness.
      <br/>
      (1) Since the stage in the cassette in which an unprocessed sample is contained is checked and movement of the checked unprocessed sample is successively monitored and controlled by numbering the unprocessed sample, the processed sample can be certainly returned to the original position of the cassette.
      <br/>
      (2) Since the stage in the cassette in which an unprocessed sample is contained is checked and movement of the checked unprocessed sample is successively monitored and controlled by numbering the unprocessed sample even in a case of series processing, parallel processing or a combination thereof, the processed sample can be certainly returned to the original position of the cassette.
      <br/>
      (3) Since the stage in the cassette in which an unprocessed sample is contained is checked and movement of the checked unprocessed sample is successively monitored and controlled by numbering the unprocessed sample, the processing state of the sample processed in the vacuum processing portion one by one can be properly checked and managed in detail.

    <p num="96">
      For example, in a case where a defect occurs in the processing of a sample, since a processing state for each of the samples including the processing condition is managed, the processing state can be identified by the information as to which stage in what cassette the defective sample is contained in.

      Therefore, the cause of the defect can be known in a short time and accordingly the time required for countermeasure can be saved by the time shortened in identification of the processing state.

      When the gap between the cassette blocks of the vacuum processing apparatuses adjacent to each other is designated as G1 and the gap between the vacuum processing blocks adjacent to each other is designated as G2 (referring to FIG. 5), it is assumed that the relation G1&lt;G2 is satisfied.
      <br/>
      The maintenance space between the vacuum processing apparatuses 100 adjacent to each other can be expressed by (W1+G1)-W2=MS.
      <br/>
      MS is a dimension required for maintenance work of an operator.

      In this case, it is preferable for the relation (W1+G1)-W2.apprxeq.d to be satisfied.
      <br/>
      Although the maintenance space 203 is an entrance for the operator, there are some cases where the space is not provided depending on the layout of the bay area 200.
      <br/>
      Even in such a case, an installation clearance G1 between the vacuum processing apparatuses adjacent to each other is required at minimum, but the installation clearance practically becomes a value near zero.

      The side face of the vacuum processing block 2 of the vacuum processing apparatus 100 in accordance with the present invention is the opening type door structure.

      Furthermore, by opening the doors 216, the processing chamber 6 and the vacuum pump and the various kinds of pipes and devices can be inspected and repaired.

    <p num="106">
      Since there is the maintenance space MS between the vacuum processing blocks 2, there is no obstacle to the operator opening the doors 214 in the side to perform maintenance work.

    </p>
    <p num="107">
      The plan shape of the vacuum processing apparatus 100 is L-shaped, as described before.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the conventional vacuum processing apparatus 800, the vacuum processing block and the cassette block are generally constructed together to form a rectangular shape on the whole, as shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      The rectangular shape is selected based on the shape of various kinds of elements installed in the vacuum processing apparatus and the mutual operational relationship among the various kinds of elements.
      <br/>
      In the general conventional vacuum processing apparatus, when the gap between the cassette blocks adjacent to each other is designated as G1 and the gap between the vacuum processing blocks adjacent to each other is designated as 2, there is the relation G1 &gt;= G2.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      Since the conventional vacuum processing apparatus 800 deals with samples having a diameter d not larger than 8 inches, such a construction described above can be used.
      <br/>
      However, in an apparatus dealing with a sample having a diameter d as large as 12 inches, the outer dimension of the cassette 12 becomes larger and consequently the width W1 of cassettes block containing a plurality of the cassette 12 becomes larger.Since the width (W2.apprxeq.W1) of the vacuum processing block is determined corresponding to the width W1, the whole of the vacuum processing apparatus 800 requires a larger space.
      <br/>
      Further, as the widths W1, W2 of the cassette block and the vacuum processing block become larger, the doors 214, 216 must be made larger and a large maintenance space is required in order to provide a space for the doors 214, 216 to be opened.
      <br/>
      For example, if a 12-inch sample is dealt with in the conventional apparatus, W1=W2=150 cm, G1=G2=90 cm and the maintenance space between the vacuum processing apparatuses 100 adjacent to each other becomes MS=90 cm.
      <br/>
      This results in an increase in the effective occupying area of the vacuum processing apparatus 800 in each of the bay areas.
      <br/>
      This is not preferable.

    <p num="109">
      An example of the mutual relationship of the various kinds of elements in the vacuum processing apparatus in accordance with the present invention will be described, referring to FIG. 10. As shown in the figure, the rotational center 01 of the arm of the vacuum transfer robot 10 is arranged on the right hand side or the left hand side of the line L--L connecting the middle position of the load lock chamber 4 and the unload lock chamber 5 and the center of the processing chamber 6, that is, the rotational center 01 is shifted toward the side of the vacuum processing portion.
      <br/>
      The post treating chamber 7 is arranged on the opposite side of the line L--L.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the rotating range of the arm of the vacuum transfer robot 10 is narrow, and the whole plan shape of the vacuum processing apparatus 100 can be made L-shaped by arranging the vacuum transfer robot 10 near the side of the vacuum processing portion.
      <br/>
      By such a construction, the rotation range of the arm of the vacuum transfer robot 10 becomes nearly one-half of one round circle.
      <br/>
      By limiting the rotating range of the arm of the vacuum robot 10 for transfer of a wafer to within nearly a semi-circle, one sample 3 can be transferred to the load lock chamber 4, the unload lock chamber 5 the processing chamber 6 and the post treating chamber 7 with nearly a semi-circle movement of the arm.
      <br/>
      As described above, since the rotating range of the arm of the vacuum transfer robot 10 is designed to be within nearly a semi-circle, the width W2 of the vacuum processing block 2 can be made narrow.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      As described above, the vacuum processing apparatus 100 in accordance with the present invention makes available the aforementioned maintenance space by making the width W2 of the vacuum processing block 2 as small as possible by taking into consideration the shape of the various kinds of elements arranged in the vacuum processing apparatus and the mutual relationship of the various elements, while providing the width W1 of the cassette block 1 copes with the large diameter sample.
      <br/>
      By doing so, the effective occupied area of the vacuum processing apparatus 100 can be increased.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      Since there is the maintenance space MS between the vacuum processing blocks 2, there is no obstacle to the operator opening the doors 214 in the side to perform maintenance work.

      In the vacuum processing apparatus 100 in accordance with the present invention, the positional relationship between the vacuum processing block 2 and the cassette block 1 can be changed along the lateral direction of the cassette block.

      For example, as shown in FIG. 11 and FIG. 12, the vacuum processing block 2 and the cassette block 1 are arranged so that the center line of the vacuum processing block 2 passes through the center of the cassette block 1 in the lateral direction, in other words, the vacuum processing block 2 and the cassette block 1 may be arranged so as to form a T-shape as seen in a top plan view.
      <br/>
      In the T-shape arrangement, since there is maintenance space MS between the vacuum processing blocks 2, here is no obstacle to the operator opening the doors 214 in the side to perform maintenance work.

      <br/>
      The structural elements contained in the cassette block 1 and the vacuum processing block 2 and the arrangement of the structural elements may be different from those in the aforementioned embodiments.
      <br/>
      For example, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 13, the atmospheric transfer robot 9 of the cassette block 1 is placed between the load lock chamber 4 and the unload lock chamber 5 of the vacuum processing block.
      <br/>
      In this case, the plan view shape of the cassette block 1 is strictly a projecting shape and the plan view shape of the vacuum processing block 2 is strictly a recessed shape, and the whole of the vacuum processing apparatus 100 is a combination of two blocks of nearly rectangular shape forming a T-shape.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the locus of the extensible arm 91 can be constructed so as to trace the locus containing the cassette 12 and the load lock chamber 4 on the load side and the load lock chamber 5 in the unload side 5 without moving the atmospheric transfer robot 9 on the rail by placing the atmospheric transfer robot 9 of the cassette block 1 between the load lock chamber 4 and the unload lock chamber 5 of the vacuum processing block and movably arranging the cassette 12 on the rail 94.

      <br/>
      There is not the aforementioned gap G1, but (W1+W3)-W2=MS becomes the maintenance space when the width of the console table 130 is W3.
      <br/>
      Since there is no gap G1, an operator needs to enter the zone 2018 in which the vacuum processing block 2 is located from the back of the bay area 200 through the maintenance path 210 in order to perform maintenance the vacuum processing block 2.

      If it is required to reduce the access time, a gap G1 may be provided between the console table 130 and the neighboring cassette block 1.
