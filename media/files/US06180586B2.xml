    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to liquid laundry detergent compositions containing protease enzymes.
      <br/>
      More specifically, this invention pertains to liquid laundry detergent compositions containing a detersive surfactant, a proteolytic enzyme, and a protease inhibitor selected from the group consisting of proteins, peptides and peptide derivatives, such as peptide aldehydes and peptide trifluromethyl ketones.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Protease-containing liquid aqueous detergents are well-known, especially in the context of laundry washing.
      <br/>
      A commonly encountered problem in such protease-containing liquid aqueous detergents is the degradation phenomenon by the proteolytic enzyme of second enzymes in the composition, such as amylase, lipase, and cellulase, or on the protease itself.
      <br/>
      As a result, the stability of the second enzyme or the protease itself in the detergent composition is affected and the detergent composition consequently performs less well.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In response to this problem, it has been proposed to use various protease inhibitors or stabilizers.
      <br/>
      For instance, various references have proposed the use of the following compounds to aid in the stabilization of enzymes: proteins, benzamidine hydrochloride, lower aliphatic alcohols or carboxylic acids, mixtures of a polyol and a boron compound, aromatic borate esters, and calcium, particularly calcium formate.
      <br/>
      Recently, it was discovered that certain peptide aldehydes and peptide trifluromethyl ketones act to stabilize protease enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Although these compounds have been used to varying success in liquid detergents, there is still a need for stable protease-containing liquid laundry detergent compositions.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="6">
      It has been proposed to use various protease inhibitors or stabilizers.
      <br/>
      For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,566,985 proposes to use benzamidine hydrochloride; EP 376 705 proposes to use lower aliphatic alcohols or carboxylic acids; EP 381 262 proposes to use a mixture of a polyol and a boron compound; and EP91870072.5 proposes to use aromatic borate esters.
      <br/>
      See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,030,378 issued Jul. 9, 1991. Also see U.S. Pat. No. 4,261,868; U.S. Pat. No. 4,404,115; U.S. Pat. No. 4,318,818; and EP130,756.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The use of peptide derivatives for the inhibition of proteins appears to have been disclosed in therapeutic applications.
      <br/>
      EP 293 881 discloses the use of peptide boronic acids as inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases.
      <br/>
      EP 185 390 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,399,065 disclose the use of certain peptide aldehydes derivatives for the inhibition of blood coagulation.
      <br/>
      J 90029670 discloses the use of optically active alpha amino aldehydes for the inhibition of enzymes in general.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="34">Definitions</p>
    <p num="35">
      The present detergent compositions comprise an "effective amount" or a "stain removal-improving amount" of individual components defined herein.
      <br/>
      An "effective amount" or "stain removal-improving amount" is any amount capable of measurably improving soil cleaning or stain removal from soiled fabric, when it is washed by the consumer.
      <br/>
      In general, this amount may vary quite widely.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The liquid aqueous laundry detergent compositions according to the present invention comprise three essential ingredients: (A) a protease inhibitor selected from the group consisting of proteins, peptides and peptide derivatives, preferably peptide aldehydes and peptide trifluromethyl ketones, or a mixture thereof, as described herein, (B) a proteolytic enzyme or a mixture thereof, and (C) a detersive surfactant.
      <br/>
      The compositions according to the present invention preferably further comprise (D) a source of calcium ions, (E) a detergent-compatible second enzyme or a mixture thereof, (F) boric acid and a diol, and may further comprise (G) other optional ingredients.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Protease Inhibitors</p>
    <p num="38">The detergent compositions according to the present invention comprise, as a first essential ingredient, a protease inhibitor selected from the group consisting proteins, peptides and peptide derivatives.</p>
    <p num="39">Preferred proteins are turkey ovomucoid, eglin, Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor, subtilisin inhibitors from other Streptomyces, including hygroscopicus, virginiae, thermovulgaris, thermotolerans, thermophilus, barley chymotrypsin inhibitor, Ascaris protease inhibitors, Cucurbita protease inhibitors, and variants thereof.</p>
    <p num="40">
      Preferred peptide derivatives are peptide aldehydes and peptide trifluromethyl ketones, or mixtures thereof, having the formula:
      <br/>
      Z--B--NH--CH(R)--C(O)--X
    </p>
    <p num="41">wherein B is a peptide chain comprising from 1 to 5 amino acid moieties; X is hydrogen or CF3 ; Z is an N-capping moiety selected from the group consisting of phosphoramidate �(R"O)2 (O)P--�, sulfenamide �(SR")2 -�, sulfonamide �(R"(O)2 S--�, sulfonic acid �SO3 H�, phosphinamide �(R")2 (O)P--�, sulfamoyl derivative �R"O(O)2 S--�, thiourea �(R")2 N(O)C--�, thiocarbamate �R"O(S)C--�, phosphonate �R"P(O)OH�, amidophosphate �R"O(OH)(O)P--�, carbamate (R"O(O)C--), and urea (R"NH(O)C--), wherein each R" is independently selected from the group consisting of straight or branched C1 -C6 unsubstituted alkyl, phenyl, C7 -C9 alkylaryl, and cycloalkyl moieties, wherein the cycloalkyl ring may span C4 -C8 and may contain one or more heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O,N,and S (preferred R" is selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, and benzyl); and R is selected from the group consisting of straight or branched C1 -C6 unsubstituted alkyl, phenyl, and C7 -C9 alkylaryl moieties.</p>
    <p num="42">
      Preferred R moieties are selected from the group consisting of methyl, iso-propyl, sec-butyl, iso-butyl, --C6 H5, --CH2 --C6 H5, and --CH2 CH2 --C6 H5, which respectively may be derived from the amino acids Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, PGly (phenylglycine), Phe, and HPhe (homophenylalanine) by converting the carboxylic acid group to an aldehyde or trifluromethyl ketone group.
      <br/>
      While such moieties are therefore not amino acids (and they may or may not have been synthesized from an amino acid precursor), for purposes of simplification of the exemplification of inhibitors useful here, the aldehyde portion of the inhibitors are indicated as derived from amino acids by the addition of "H" after the analogous amino acid �e.g., "--AlaH" represents the chemical moiety "--NHCH(CH3)C(O)H"�. Trifluromethyl ketones are similarly represented by the addition of "CF3 " after the analogous amino acid (e.g., "--AlaCF3 " represents the chemical moiety "--NHCH(CH3)C(O)CF3 "�.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Preferred B peptide chains are selected from the group consisting of peptide chains having the amino acid sequences according to the general formula:</p>
    <p num="44">Z-A5 -A4 -A3 -A2 -A1 --NH--CH(R)--C(O)-X</p>
    <p num="45">such that the following amino acids, when present, are:</p>
    <p num="46">A1 is selected from Ala, Gly;</p>
    <p num="47">A2, if present, is selected from Val, Ala, Gly, Ile;</p>
    <p num="48">A3, if present, is selected from Phe, Leu, Val, Ile;</p>
    <p num="49">A4, if present, is any amino acid, but preferably is selected from Gly, Ala;</p>
    <p num="50">A5, if present, is any amino acid, but preferably is Gly, Ala, Lys.</p>
    <p num="51">
      The present invention aldehydes may be prepared from the corresponding amino acid whereby the C-terminal end of said amino acid is converted from a carboxylic group to an aldehyde group.
      <br/>
      Such aldehydes may be prepared by known processes, for instance as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,015,627, EP 185 930, EP 583,534, and DE 32 00 812.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The present invention trifluromethyl ketones may be prepared from the corresponding amino acid whereby the C-terminal end of said amino acid is converted from a carboxylic group to the trifluromethyl ketone group.
      <br/>
      Such trifluromethyl ketones may be prepared by known processes, for instance as described in EP 583,535.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      While not wanting to be bound by theory it is believed that the protease inhibitors according to the present invention bind to the proteolytic enzyme in the liquid detergent composition, thereby inhibiting said proteolytic enzyme.
      <br/>
      Upon dilution in water, the proteolytic activity is restored by dissociation of the proteolytic enzyme/protease inhibitor complex.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The N-terminal end of said protease inhibitors according to the present invention is protected by one of the N-capping moiety protecting groups selected from the group consisting of carbamates, ureas, sulfonamides, phosphonamides,thioureas, sulfenamides, sulfonic acids, phosphinamides, thiocarbamates, amidophosphates, and phosphonamides.
      <br/>
      However, in a highly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the N-terminal end of said protease inhibitor is protected by a methyl, ethyl or benzyl carbamate �CH3 O--(O)C--; CH3 CH2 O--(O)C--; or C6 H5 CH2 O--(O)C--�, methyl, ethyl or benzyl urea �CH3 NH(O)C--; CH3 CH2 NH--(O)C--; or C6 H5 CH2 NH--(O)C--�, methyl, ethyl or benzyl sulfonamide �CH3 SO2 -; CH3 CH2 SO2 -; or C6 H5 CH2 SO2 -�, and methyl, ethyl or benzyl amidophosphate �CH3 O(OH)(O)P--; CH3 CH2 O(OH)(O)P--; or C6 H5 CH2 O(OH)(O)P--� groups.

      For purposes of the present invention, it is necessary to determine the protease activity in the laundry detergent composition and in the laundry wash.

      These measurements can be made as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="133">(1) In the Composition</p>
    <p num="134">
      A one ml sample of surfactant-containing base formulation is mixed with the appropriate amount of protease and inhibitor.
      <br/>
      After allowing about ten minutes for the inhibitor and protease to combine, 10  MU l of 20 mg/ml substrate (succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroaniline) is added.
      <br/>
      The sample is mixed and placed in a spectrophotometer.
      <br/>
      The optical density at 410 nm is monitored over twenty minutes. (At early times, the optical density falls, presumably because of a decrease in number of air bubbles in the optical path.) The rise in optical density is relatively linear over the last ten minutes, and this rate of increase is measured.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      The protease activity in the absence of inhibitor is also measured using the same technique.
      <br/>
      However, if the full amount of protease were added, the consumption of substrate would be so fast that no meaningful measure would be obtained.
      <br/>
      Therefore the protease-free surfactant-containing base formulation product is used whereby 1% of the product level of protease is added.
      <br/>
      The rate is measured as described above and the values compared.

    <p num="185">Second Enzyme</p>
    <p num="186">
      Preferred compositions herein further comprise a performance-enhancing amount of a detergent-compatible second enzyme.
      <br/>
      By "detergent-compatible" is meant compatibility with the other ingredients of a liquid detergent composition, such as detersive surfactant and detergency builder.
      <br/>
      These second enzymes are preferably selected from the group consisting of lipase, amylase, cellulase, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      The term "second enzyme" excludes the proteolytic enzymes discussed above, so each composition which has a second enzyme contains at least two kinds of enzyme, including at least one proteolytic enzyme.
      <br/>
      The amount of second enzyme used in the composition varies according to the type of enzyme.
      <br/>
      In general, from about 0.0001 to 0.3, more preferably 0.001 to 0.1, weight % of these second enzymes are preferably used.
      <br/>
      Mixtures of the same class of enzymes (e.g. lipase) or two or more classes (e.g. cellulase and lipase) may be used.
      <br/>
      Purified or non-purified forms of the enzyme may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="187">
      Any lipolytic enzyme suitable for use in a liquid detergent composition can be used in these compositions.
      <br/>
      Suitable lipase enzymes for use herein include those of bacterial and fungal origin.
    </p>
    <p num="188">
      Suitable bacterial lipases include those produced by microorganisms of the Pseudomonas groups, such as Pseudomonas stutzeri ATCC 19.154, as disclosed in British Patent 1,372,034, incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Suitable lipases include those which show a positive immunological cross-reaction with the antibody of the lipase produced by the microorganism Pseudomonas fluorescens IAM 1057.
      <br/>
      This lipase and a method for its purification have been described in Japanese Patent Application 53-20487, laid open on Feb. 24, 1978. This lipase is available from Amano Pharmaceutical Co.
      <br/>
      Ltd., Nagoya, Japan, under the trade name Lipase P "Amano," hereinafter referred to as "Amano-P." Such lipases should show a positive immunological cross-reaction with the Amano-P antibody, using the standard and well-known immunodiffusion procedure according to Ouchterlony (Acta. Med. Scan., 133, pages 76-79 (1950)).
      <br/>
      These lipases, and a method for their immunological cross-reaction with Amano-P, are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,707,291, Thom et al., issued Nov. 17, 1987, incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Typical examples thereof are the Amano-P lipase, the lipase ex Pseudomonas fragi FERM P 1339 (available under the trade name Amano-B), lipase ex Pseudomonas nitroreducens var. lipolvticum FERM P 1338 (available under the trade name Amano-CES), lipases ex Chromobacter viscosum, e.g. Chromobacter viscosum var. lipolyticum NRRLB 3673, commercially available from Toyo Jozo Co., Tagata, Japan; and further Chromobacter viscosum lipases from U.S. Biochemical Corp., U.S.A. and Disoynth Co., The Netherlands, and lipases ex Pseudomonas gladioli.
    </p>
    <p num="189">
      Suitable fungal lipases include those producible by Humicola lanuginosa and Thermomyces lanuginosus.
      <br/>
      Most preferred is lipase obtained by cloning the gene from Humicola lanuginosa and expressing the gene in Aspergillus oryzae as described in European Patent Application 0 258 068 (Novo Industri A/S), commercially available from Novo Nordisk A/S under the trade name Lipolase.RTM..
    </p>
    <p num="190">
      From about 10 to 18,000, preferably about 60 to 6,000, lipase units per gram (LU/g) of lipase can be used in these compositions.
      <br/>
      A lipase unit is that amount of lipase which produces 1 mmol of titratable fatty acid per minute in a pH stat, where pH is 9.0, temperature is 30 (degree)  C., substrate is an emulsion of 3.3 wt % of olive oil and 3.3% gum arabic, in the presence of 13 mmol/Ca++ and 20 mmol/l NaCl in 5 mmol/l Tris-buffer.
    </p>
    <p num="191">Preferred compositions of the present invention inhibit the protease activity in the composition such that the half life of the lipase in the composition is at least one month at 90 (degree)  F.</p>
    <p num="192">
      Any cellulase suitable for use in a liquid detergent composition can be used in these compositions.
      <br/>
      Suitable cellulase enzymes for use herein include those from bacterial and fungal origins.
      <br/>
      Preferably, they will have a pH optimum of between 5 and 9.5. From about 0.0001 to 0.1 weight % cellulase can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="193">
      Suitable cellulases are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,435,307, Barbesgaard et al., issued Mar. 6, 1984, incorporated herein by reference, which discloses fungal cellulase produced from Humicola insolens.
      <br/>
      Suitable cellulases are also disclosed in GB-A-2.075.028, GB-A-2.095.275 and DE-OS-2.247.832.
    </p>
    <p num="194">Examples of such cellulases are cellulases produced by a strain of Humicola insolens (Humicola grisea var. thermoidea), particularly the Humicola strain DSM 1800, and cellulases produced by a fungus of Bacillus N or a cellulase 212-producing fungus belonging to the genus Aeromonas, and cellulase extracted from the hepatopancreas of a marine mollusc (Dolabella Auricula Solander).</p>
    <p num="195">
      Any amylase suitable for use in a liquid detergent composition can be used in these compositions.
      <br/>
      Amylases include, for example, amylases obtained from a special strain of B.licheniformis, described in more detail in British Patent Specification No. 1,296,839 (Novo).
      <br/>
      Amylolytic proteins include, for example, RapidaseR, International Bio-Synthetics, Inc. and TermarylR Novo Industries.
    </p>
    <p num="196">From about 0.0001% to 0.55, preferably 0.0005 to 0.1, wt. % amylase can be used.</p>
    <p num="197">Calcium</p>
    <p num="198">
      The compositions herein may optionally comprise a calcium ion source.
      <br/>
      Any water-soluble calcium salt can be used as a source of calcium ions, including calcium acetate, calcium formate, calcium xylene sulfonate, and calcium propionate.
      <br/>
      Divalent ions, such as zinc and magnesium ions, can replace the calcium ion completely or in part.
      <br/>
      Thus in the liquid detergent compositions herein, the source of calcium ions can be partially substituted with a source of another divalent ion.
    </p>
    <p num="199">
      The calcium useful herein is enzyme-accessible.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the preferred compositions are substantially free of sequestrants, for example, polyacids capable of forming calcium complexes which are soluble in the composition.
      <br/>
      However, minor amounts of sequestrants such as polyacids or mixtures of polyacids can be used.
      <br/>
      The enzyme-accessible calcium is defined as the amount of calcium-ions effectively available to the enzyme component.
      <br/>
      From a practical standpoint the enzyme-accessible calcium is therefore the soluble calcium in the composition in the absence of any storage sequestrants, e.g., having an equilibrium constant of complexation with calcium equal to or greater than 1.5 at 20 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="200">Boric Acid</p>
    <p num="201">

      <br/>
      Boric acid is preferred, although other compounds such as boric oxide, borax and other alkali metal borates (e.g., sodium ortho-, meta-, pyroborate, an sodium pentaborate) are suitable.
      <br/>
      Substituted boric acids (e.g., phenylboronic acid, butane boronic acid, and p-bromo phenylboronic acid) can also be used in place of boric acid.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      The compositions of the present invention can also contain polyols, especially diols, containing only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
      <br/>
      They preferably contain from about 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups.
      <br/>
      Examples include propylene glycol (especially 1,2 propanediol, which is preferred), ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol, glucose, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      The polyol generally represents from about 1% to about 15%, preferably from about 1.5% to about 10%, more preferably from about 2% to about 7%, by weight of the composition.
    </p>
    <p num="203">Optional Ingredients</p>
    <p num="204">
      Detergent builders can optionally be included in the compositions herein, especially for laundry compositions.
      <br/>
      Inorganic as well as organic builders can be used.
      <br/>
      When present, the compositions will typically comprise at least about 1% builder and can be either an inorganic or organic builder.

      wherein A is H or OH; B is H or --O--CH(COOX)CH2 (COOX); and X is H or a salt-forming cation.
      <br/>
      For example, if in the above general formula A and B are both H, then the compound is oxydissuccinic acid and its water-soluble salts.
      <br/>
      If A is OH and B is H, then the compound is tartrate monosuccinic acid (TMS) and its water-soluble salts.
