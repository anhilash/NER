    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to the use of alkylated aminoethers to reduce the surface tension in water-based systems.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The ability to reduce the surface tension of water is of great importance in waterborne coatings, inks, adhesives, and agricultural formulations because decreased surface tension translates to enhanced substrate wetting in actual formulations.
      <br/>
      Surface tension reduction in water-based systems is generally achieved through the addition of surfactants.
      <br/>
      Performance attributes resulting from the addition of surfactants include enhanced surface coverage, fewer defects, and more uniform distribution.
      <br/>
      Equilibrium surface tension performance is important when the system is at rest.
      <br/>
      However, the ability to reduce surface tension under dynamic conditions is of great importance in applications where high surface creation rates are utilized.
      <br/>
      Such applications include spraying, rolling and brushing of coatings or spraying of agricultural formulations, or high speed gravure or ink-jet printing.
      <br/>
      Dynamic surface tension is a fundamental quantity which provides a measure of the ability of a surfactant to reduce surface tension and provide wetting under such high speed application conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Traditional nonionic surfactants such as alkylphenol or alcohol ethoxylates, and ethylene oxide (EO)/propylene oxide (PO) copolymers have excellent equilibrium surface tension performance but are generally characterized as having poor dynamic surface tension reduction.
      <br/>
      In contrast, certain anionic surfactants such as sodium dialkyl sulfosuccinates can provide good dynamic results, but these are very foamy and impart water sensitivity to the finished coating.
    </p>
    <p num="5">There is a need for a family of surfactants which provide good equilibrium and dynamic surface tension properties, are low-foaming, are liquids at room temperature to facilitate handling and are stable under basic conditions and thus would be widely accepted in the coating, ink, adhesive, and agricultural formulation industries.</p>
    <p num="6">The importance of reducing equilibrium and dynamic surface tension in applications such as coatings, inks, and agricultural formulations is well-appreciated in the art.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Low dynamic surface tension is of great importance in the application of waterborne coatings.
      <br/>
      In an article, Schwartz, J. "The Importance of Low Dynamic Surface Tension in Waterborne Coatings", Journal of Coatings Technology, September 1992, there is a discussion of surface tension properties in waterborne coatings and a discussion of dynamic surface tension in such coatings.
      <br/>
      Equilibrium and dynamic surface tension were evaluated for several surface active agents.
      <br/>
      It is pointed out that low dynamic surface tension is an important factor in achieving superior film formation in waterborne coatings.
      <br/>
      Dynamic coating application methods require surfactants with low dynamic surface tensions in order to prevent defects such as retraction, craters, and foam.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Efficient application of agricultural products is also highly dependent on the dynamic surface tension properties of the formulation.
      <br/>
      In an article, Wirth, W.; Storp, S.; Jacobsen, W. "Mechanisms Controlling Leaf Retention of Agricultural Spray Solutions"; Pestic.
      <br/>
      Sci. 1991, 33, 411-420, the relationship between the dynamic surface tension of agricultural formulations and the ability of these formulations to be retained on a leaf was studied.
      <br/>
      These workers observed a good correlation between retention values and dynamic surface tension, with more effective retention of formulations exhibiting low dynamic surface tension.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Low dynamic surface tension is also important in high-speed printing as discussed in the article "Using Surfactants to Formulate VOC Compliant Waterbased Inks", Medina, S. W.; Sutovich, M. N. Am. Ink Maker 1994, 72 (2), 32-38. In this article, it is stated that equilibrium surface tensions (EST's) are pertinent only to ink systems at rest.
      <br/>
      EST values, however, are not good indicators of performance in the dynamic, high speed printing environment under which the ink is used.
      <br/>
      Dynamic surface tension is a more appropriate property.
      <br/>
      This dynamic measurement is an indicator of the ability of the surfactant to migrate to a newly created ink/substrate interface to provide wetting during high speed printing.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,478 discloses water-based ink compositions comprising water, a pigment, a nonionic surfactant and a solubilizing agent for the nonionic surfactant.
      <br/>
      Dynamic surface tension in ink compositions for publication gravure printing must be reduced to a level of about 25 to 40 dynes/cm to assure that printability problems will not be encountered.
    </p>
    <p num="11">U.S. Pat. No. 5,562,762 discloses an aqueous jet ink of water, dissolved dyes and a tertiary amine having two polyethoxylate substituents and that low dynamic surface tension is important in ink jet printing.</p>

      where n is 2-6, preferably 2-4; m is 0-4, preferably 0-2; and p and q are 2-6, preferably 2 or 3; and R and R' independently are an alkyl group comprising 5 to 18 carbons, preferably 5 to 8 carbons which is branched or in which the point of attachment to nitrogen is on a nonterminal carbon, for the reduction of equilibrium and dynamic surface tension in water-based compositions containing an organic compound, particularly coating, ink, and agricultural compositions containing organic compounds such as polymeric resins, herbicides, pesticides or plant growth modifying agents.
      <br/>
      It is desirable that an aqueous solution of the alkylated aminoether demonstrates a dynamic surface tension of less than 45 dynes/cm at a concentration of  &lt;= 5 wt % in water at 23 (degree)  C. and 1 bubble/second according to the maximum-bubble-pressure method.
      <br/>
      The maximum-bubble-pressure method of measuring surface tension is described in Langmuir 1986, 2, 428-432, which is incorporated by reference.

      The alkylated aminoethers can be prepared by reductive alkylation of the parent aminoethers with aldehydes and ketones using well-established procedures.
      <br/>
      The essential aspects of the preparation are the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with the aminoether to make an imine or enamine intermediate which then reacts with hydrogen in the presence of a suitable hydrogenation catalyst to form the corresponding saturated derivative.  (Chemical Structure image '11' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="40">The imine or enamine derivative may be preformed or may be prepared in situ.</p>
    <p num="41">The products could also be prepared by reductive amination of a suitable dinitrile.</p>
    <p num="42">This reaction is illustrated for the cyanoethylated derivative of ethylene glycol:  (Chemical Structure image '12' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="43">
      The reductive alkylation and reductive amination procedures are the methods of choice for the production of these materials, but the products may also be prepared by reaction of an amine with a chloralkylether.

      This reaction is illustrated for chloroethyl ether and an amine:  (Chemical Structure image '13' not included in text)

      <br/>
      The aminopropoxy compounds may be prepared by reaction of a diol with acrylonitrile, followed by hydrogenation:  (Chemical Structure image '14' not included in text)

    <p num="46">Suitable diols for use in the aminopropylation reaction include 1,2-ethanediol; 1,3-propanediol; 1,4-butanediol; 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, and the like; diethylene glycol; triethyleneglycol; tetraethyleneglycol, and the like; dipropyleneglycol, tripropyleneglycol, and the like.</p>
    <p num="47">
      Alkyl groups which are suitable for use on the aminoethers should have sufficient carbon atoms to confer surface activity (i.e. an ability to reduce the surface tension of water) to the material but not enough carbon atoms to decrease the solubility to the extent that the ability of the material to reduce surface tension is insufficient for a particular application.
      <br/>
      In general, an increase in the carbon number increases the efficiency of the resulting alkylated aminoether surfactant (i.e., less surfactant is required to obtain a given decrease in surface tension) but decreases its ability to reduce surface tension at high surface creation rates (i.e., less effective for reducing dynamic surface tension).
      <br/>
      The latter effect is a result of the fact that increased carbon number generally decreases the water solubility of the material, and consequently, diminishes the diffusive flux of surfactant to newly-created surface.
      <br/>
      Generally, in the practice of this invention, it is desirable to use alkylated aminoethers having a solubility in water of at least 0.005 wt %, preferably from 0.01 to 2 wt %, and most preferably from 0.05 to 1.5 wt %.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The alkyl groups may be the same or different.
      <br/>
      They may be branched or the point of attachment to the nitrogen of the diamine may be on an internal carbon.
      <br/>
      Suitable alkyl groups are derived from reductive alkylation reactions of a C5 to C8 aldehyde or ketone, preferably derived from reductive alkylation reactions of methyl isobutyl ketone or methyl isoamyl ketone.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of suitable C5 to C8 aldehydes and ketones include 2-pentanone, 3-pentanone, pivaldehyde, methyl isopropyl ketone, 2-hexanone, 3-hexanone, methyl tert-butyl ketone, ethyl isopropyl ketone, 2-methylhexanal, 2-heptanone, 3-heptanone, 4-heptanone, 2-octanone, 3-octanone, 4-octanone, 2-ethylhexanal, and so on.
      <br/>
      The specific carbonyl compound and aminoether chosen will depend on the surfactant properties required for a particular application.

    <p num="49">
      The alkylated aminoethers are suitable for use in an aqueous composition comprising in water an inorganic compound which is a mineral ore or a pigment or an organic compound which is a pigment, a polymerizable monomer, such as addition, condensation and vinyl monomers, an oligomeric resin, a polymeric resin, a detergent, a herbicide, a pesticide, or a plant growth modifying agent.
      <br/>
      An amount of the alkylated aminoether compound that is effective to reduce the equilibrium and/or dynamic surface tension of the water-based inorganic and/or organic compound-containing composition is added.

      Such effective amount may range from 0.001 to 20 g/100 ml, preferably 0.01 to 2 g/100 ml, of the aqueous composition.

      These results show that a solution of this material at a use level of 0.1 wt % provides surface tensions that will prove advantageous in a variety of waterborne applications.
      <br/>
      At the high surface creation rate of 20 b/s, the performance of a 0.1 wt % solution of BAPE/MIBK2 was 39.2 dyne/cm. Because BAPE/MIBK2 has a relatively high solubility, a performance regime can be accessed which is simply not attainable with surfactants of the prior art.
      <br/>
      Thus, BAPE/MIBK2 could be useful in coating, ink, and agricultural formulations which could be applied at fast rates.

      The foaming properties of 0.1 wt % solutions of the reductive alkylation products of the products of this invention were examined using a procedure based upon ASTM D 1173-53.
      <br/>
      In this test, a 0.1 wt % solution of the surfactant is added from an elevated foam pipette to a foam receiver containing the same solution.
      <br/>
      The foam height is measured at the completion of the addition ("Initial Foam Height") and the time required for the foam to dissipate is recorded ("Time to 0 Foam").
      <br/>
      This test provides a comparison between the foaming characteristics of various surfactant solutions.
      <br/>
      In general, in coatings, inks, and agricultural formulations, foam is undesirable because is complicates handling and can lead to coating and print defects, and to inefficient application of agricultural materials.

      The ability of a surfactant in aqueous systems to reduce surface tension under both equilibrium and dynamic conditions is of great importance in the performance of waterbased coatings, inks, adhesives, and agricultural formulations.
      <br/>
      Low equilibrium surface tension allows the development of excellent properties subsequent to application.
      <br/>
      Low dynamic surface tension results in enhanced wetting and spreading under the dynamic conditions of application, resulting in more efficient use of the formulations and fewer defects.
      <br/>
      In waterborne coatings, inks, adhesives, and agricultural formulations, the formation of foam is generally undesirable because it complicates handling and can cause defects or result in inefficient application.

    <p num="95">In addition, these materials are low-viscosity liquids, and are therefore easy to handle.</p>
