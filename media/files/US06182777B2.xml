    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to a suspension system for a work machine having a pair of adjustable track roller frame assemblies.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Typical agricultural work machines are commonly supported and propelled by pneumatic tires.
      <br/>
      Pneumatic tires provide a great deal of cushioning or bounce as these machines encounter disparities in the surface of the soil the machines are working.
      <br/>
      These machines have therefore not required or have not been provided with suspension systems.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Steel track laying machines have long been used in earthworking, construction, and agriculture, because of the benefits of improved traction and reduced soil compaction.
      <br/>
      However, these machines are heavy and much slower moving than the pneumatic tired machines and work in environments not requiring suspension to any great degree.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      With the introduction and acceptance of endless elastomeric track laying machines in the agriculture industry, new challenges have arisen.
      <br/>
      These track laying machines have been designed to perform the same operations as the pneumatic tired machines while offering benefits provided by the steel track laying counterparts.
      <br/>
      However, these machines need to be flexible to change between a variety of row crop spacing and travel at higher operating speeds for roading the work machine between different fields.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is desirable to have a support system that is flexible and readily adaptable to varied row crop spacing, and provides suspension to reduce the shocks to the machine and operator.
    </p>
    <p num="5">The present invention is directed to overcome one or more of the problems as set forth above.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      In one aspect of the present invention a suspension system for connecting and supporting a track laying work machine on first and second track roller frames is provided.

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      Referring to FIG. 1, a work machine 10 is shown having a body portion 12 supported by a main frame 14 and a rubber belted track system 16.
      <br/>
      The work machine 10 includes an engine 20, and a transmission not shown, operatively connected to the main frame 14.
      <br/>
      The final drive 22, as shown in FIG. 4 defines a laterally extending axis 24.
      <br/>
      The engine 20, transmission, and the final drive 22 are used for driving the rubber belted track system 16 in a conventional manner.
      <br/>
      As an alternative, the conventional system could be of any scope such as a manual drive system, hydrostatic drive system, or a power shift system.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      As best seen in FIG. 3 main frame 14 includes longitudinally extending spaced apart members 30.
      <br/>
      Side members 30 are connected at a forward end by an engine mounting structure 32.
      <br/>
      A pair of box member 34 joins the side members 30 at generally the middle portion thereof and is connected thereto by fasteners.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      As best seen in FIGS. 2, 3 and 6 a laterally extending elongated beam, referred to herein as a hard bar 40 having a substantially circular cross-section extends between and is supported by the rubber belted track system 16.
      <br/>
      Hard bar 40 is preferably located within cutouts positioned in side members 30 of main frame 14.
      <br/>
      A structural transmission 36 is connected to the end of each side member 30 maintaining the spacing therebetween.
      <br/>
      Rebound pads 44, which in this application are made of an elastomeric material, are positioned directly under the hard bar 40.
      <br/>
      The rebound pads 44 create a cushion for the hard bar 40 during operation of the work machine 10 so that direct contact between the side members 30 and the hard bar is avoided.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      An alternative arrangement is shown in FIG. 3a, and a prime designation will be used for like elements.
      <br/>
      Side members 30' are connected in a similar manner at the forward ends by an engine mounting structure 32.
      <br/>
      A box member 34' joins the side members 30' at generally a middle portion thereof, and is connected thereto by fasteners.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Hard bar 40 is located in inverted "U" shaped cutouts in the underside of side members 30' of main frame 14.
      <br/>
      Steel plates 42 are fastened as by welding, to the bottom side of side members 30', one each spanning the void created by the inverted "U" shaped cutouts.
      <br/>
      Rebound pads 44, are connected to the steel plates 42 and are positioned directly under the hard bar 40.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Hard bar 40 has first and second end portions 46 extending beyond the main frame 14 on either side of the work machine 10, and a middle portion 48 is encompassed within the side members 30 of the main frame 14 and the box member 34.</p>
    <p num="16">
      As best shown in FIG. 6 a suspension system 50, includes first and second suspension members 52 positioned on the middle portion 48 of the hard bar 40 and within the pair of box members 34.
      <br/>
      As alternatively shown in FIG. 3a first and second suspension members 52 are positioned on middle portion 48 of the hard bar 40 within box member 34'. Suspension members 52 are connected with the hard bar 40 and the pair of box members 34 and the box member 34' (in FIG. 3a), for example, by pins 54 projecting from the hard bar 40 and the box members 34.
      <br/>
      In this manner suspension members 52 are prevented from moving laterally when the weight of the machine 10 is place on the rubber belted track system 16.
      <br/>
      An anti sway bar 56 is interposed the suspension members 52 in a lateral direction, and the hard bar 40 and the box member 34 in an elevational direction.
      <br/>
      One end of anti sway bar 56 is pivotally connected to the box members 34, or the box member 34' as shown in FIG. 3a of the main frame 14 and the other end is pivotally connected to the middle portion 48 of the hard bar 40.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Preferably, suspension members 52 are Firestone "MARSH MELLOW SPRINGS", which are a rubber fabric composite having a predetermined stiffness.
      <br/>
      As an alternative, suspension members 52 could utilize other passive components such as cylinders, pneumatic cylinders, a nitrogen over oil strut, a shock absorber mechanism, or coil springs.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As a further alternative, the suspension system 50 could utilize an active system, not shown, such as a motion accelerometer being attached to the front end of the work machine 10 sending a signal therefrom and feeding data to a controller.
      <br/>
      Within the controller, the data would be interpreted and fluid would be directed to the cylinders to compensate for the either the upward or downward motion of the front-end of the work machine 10.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The rubber belted track system 16 shown in FIG. 2 is further comprised by first and second track roller frames 60 that are laterally spaced apart on opposing sides of the main frame 14.
      <br/>
      In as much as the first and second track rollers frames 60 are substantially operatively and structurally similar, further reference will be made to only a single side of the rubber track system 16 and like reference numbers will be used for like components.
      <br/>
      A drive wheel 62 is rotatably connected to a first end portion 63 of the track roller frame 60 and drivingly connected to an axle 64 as will be discussed later.
      <br/>
      An idler wheel 66 is pivotally and rotatably connected to a second end portion 67 of track roller frame 60 by swing link 68.
      <br/>
      An endless rubber track 70 is entrained around the drive wheel 62 and the idler wheel 66 and is tensioned into frictional driving engagement by tension system 72.
      <br/>
      In this application the drive wheel 62 is positioned near the back of the work machine 10 and the idler wheel 66 is positioned toward the front of the work machine 10.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As best seen in FIG. 5, a split collar assembly 80 comprised of a first collar 82 and a second collar 84 provide a connecting means 86 that fixedly attaches the track roller frame 60 to the hard bar 40.
      <br/>
      Split collar assembly 80 also permits axial adjustment to vary the spacing of the track roller frames 60 or gage setting.
      <br/>
      A generally horizontal axis 87 is defined by first and second collars 82,84 in an assembled position.
      <br/>
      First and second collars 82,84 are semi-circular pieces that have axially extending flanges 88 located on opposite ends thereof.
      <br/>

    <p num="27">Industrial Applicability</p>
    <p num="28">
      With the present configuration, a suspension system 50 is provided for a work machine 10 that reduces operator shock loads that are encountered during normal operation.
      <br/>
      The suspension system 50 allows the track roller frames 60 to be moved along the first and second end portions 46 of the hard bar 40 defining a gage setting for the work machine 10.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The suspension system 50 functions as follows.
      <br/>
      When the weight of the work machine 10 is placed on the rubber belted track system 16, the body portion 12 of the work machine 10 pivots about the axis 24.
      <br/>
      The first and second suspension members 52 suspend the hard bar 40 between rebound pads 44 and the cutouts in side members 30.
      <br/>
      In this position the first and second suspension members 52 are preloaded and allow the main frame 14 and the body portion 12 to float with respect to the hard bar 40.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In operation, when the work machine 10 is operating in a forward direction the track roller frames 60, either singly or together, will encounter disparities in the surface of the ground being worked.
      <br/>
      If a single obstacle is encountered the respective idler wheel 66 and the second end portion 67 of a track roller frame 60 will be forced in an upward direction causing the track roller frame 60 to pivot about the axis 24 defined by the final drive 22.
      <br/>
      The respective suspension member 52 will deform in response to the magnitude of this upward force, thereby dampening the force transmitted to the main frame 14 and the operator.
      <br/>
      The pivotal movement of the track roller frame 60 will exert a moment on the hard bar 40.
      <br/>
      The cushioning member 90 attached to the inner surface of the first and second collars 82,84 of the split collar assembly 80 will deform elastically, thereby reducing the twisting action exerted on the hard bar 40.
      <br/>
      In this manner the wrapping action of the hard bar 40, or twisting between track roller frames 60 is minimized.
      <br/>
      This reduces the possibility of the hard bar 40 acting as a torque tube allowing the torque acting on one track roller frame 60 to be transmitted to the opposing track roller frame 60.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In the event that both track roller frames encounter the same disparity simultaneously, both idler wheels 66 and the second end portions 67 of the track roller frames 60 will be forced in an upward direction.
      <br/>
      First and second track roller frames 60 will pivot about the axis 24 defined by the final drive 22, thereby pushing up against the hard bar 40.
      <br/>
      First and second suspension members 50 will deform in response to the magnitude of this upward force, dampening the force transmitted to the main frame 14 and the operator.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      After the idler wheels 66 individually or simultaneously traverse the disparity, the drive wheels 62 will then encounter the same obstacle.
      <br/>
      Each of the driving disks 130,152 of the drive wheel 62 will be forced upward, pushing against the hub assembly 100 and causing the cushioning member 180 to deform.
      <br/>
      The deformation of cushioning member 180 reduces the loads that act on the bearings 174 and the final drive 22.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Additional benefits of the hub assembly 100 supported generally about its center is that the track roller frame 60, the drive wheel 62, the idler wheel 66, and the endless belt 70 form an integral assembly.
      <br/>
      This assembly can be detached from the main frame 12 while the endless belt 70 remains tensioned by the tensioning system 72.
      <br/>
      Making gage changes easier and more efficient.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, with the second end portion 67, including the cushioning member 90, being positioned about the center portion 106 of the hub assembly 100, a variation or mis-alignment of the track roller frame 60 to the pair of bearings 174 allow for less than a prefect gage adjustment or alignment.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Changing the gage setting of the work machine 10 is performed as follows.
      <br/>
      First one of the track roller frames 60 of the rubber belted track system 16 is elevated so that it is no longer in ground engaging contact.
      <br/>
      Fasteners 91 are loosened releasing the attachment of the first and second collars 82,84 from the hard bar 40.
      <br/>
      Fastener 198 is then loosened moving the second wedge 184 out of keyways 119,139.
      <br/>
      By moving the second wedge 184 away from the first wedge 183 the driving connection of the drive wheel 62 to the axle 64 is freed.
      <br/>
      The track roller frame 60, drive wheel 62, idler wheel 66, and the endless rubber track 70 is then urged either inward towards the main frame 14 or outward depending on the gage setting desired, Fasteners 91 and fasteners 198 are then tightened reversing the process.
      <br/>
      The identical process is performed on the other side of the work machine to completing the gage changing procedure.
