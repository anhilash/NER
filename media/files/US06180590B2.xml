      The use of an amine with an average pKA of from 1 to 14 as detergency booster, preferably in textile detergents, especially in color detergents, and detergent formulations containing these amines.

      DE-A1-3124210 describes liquid detergents with additives to prevent dye transfer.
      <br/>
      The detergent in this case contains nonionic or switterionic sufactants in combination with polyethylene, amines, polyamines, polyamine-amides or polyacrylamides, which counteract dye transfer from colored textiles to white or pale-colored textiles when they are laundered together.
      <br/>
      The polyamine-amides are obtainable by condensation of polybasic acids such as dibasic saturated aliphatic C3-8 acids and polyamines.
      <br/>
      The polymers are described as soluble in water but not identified in detail.

      The detergents comprise nonionic surfactants, with or without zwitterionic surfactants, bleaching compounds, and additives to protect dyed textiles from color changes, which are polyethyleneimines, polyamines, polyamine-amides or polyacrylamides.

      These compounds are described as soluble in water but not specified in detail.

    <p num="193">
      The detergency boosting effect of the amines according to the invention (single wash cycle performance) was determined in washing tests in a Launder-Meter under standardized conditions.
      <br/>
      The following detergent formulations A and B whose composition is indicated in Table 1 were employed.
      <br/>
      It is likewise possible according to the invention to use detergent formulations C-M.
    </p>
    <p num="194">Detergent formulations A and B were initially investigated without a detergency booster according to the invention and subsequently investigated with the detergency boosters according to the invention from Examples 1 to 8 in concentrations of 1 or 2% of the total weight of detergent.</p>
    <p num="195">
      Detergent formulations A and B with/without these additives were used to prewash cotton BW221, polyester PES850 and blended cotton/polyester fabric MG 768 as test fabrics under the washing conditions stated below.
      <br/>
      They were then dried and soiled with 0.2 g of used engine oil.
      <br/>
      The soiled test fabrics were left to age for 14 hours.
      <br/>
      The test fabrics were then washed again with detergent formulations A and B with/without the additives, and the single wash cycle performance was determined.
    </p>
    <p num="196">To do this, the reflectance was determined for the soiled test fabrics before washing (R before) and after washing (R after) using a Datacolor photometer (Elrepho.RTM.2000).</p>
    <p num="197">Washing conditions:</p>
    <p num="198">
      Machine: Launder-O-Meter from Atlas, Chicago
      <br/>
      Wash liquor: 250 ml

      Detergent dose: 6 g/l
      <br/>
      Water hardness: 3 mmol; Ca: Mg 4:1

      Liquor ratio: 1:12.5
      <br/>
      Test fabrics: BW221, PES850, MG 768
    </p>
    <p num="200">Washing result</p>
    <p num="201">
      To assess the washing result, the reflectance of the test fabric was determined before soiling (R zero), after soiling and before washing (R before) and after washing (R after).
      <br/>
      The ratio of R after/R zero was then determined and multiplied by 100.
      <br/>
      A higher value for this percentage indicates better removal of the spots.
      <br/>
      On complete removal of the spot, R after/R zero * 100=100%.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      Furthermore, the difference in removal of the spot between detergent formulations without and with the detergency booster according to the invention was determined.
      <br/>
      To do this, the difference between R after and R before, ie. delta R=R after minus R before, was determined, in particular for the detergent formulation without detergency booster according to the invention as delta R without and with detergency booster according to the invention as delta R with.
    </p>
    <p num="203">A higher difference delta (delta R)=delta R with minus delta R without indicates a greater detergency boosting effect of the added detergency booster according to the invention.</p>
    <p num="204">Besides the detergency boosters according to the invention of Examples 1 to 8, I and II (I=reaction product of N-coconut fatty-1,3-diaminopropane with 4 mol of EO (ethylene oxide), II=reaction product of N-tallow fatty-1,3-diaminopropane with 4.5 mol of EO) as described in EP-A-042 187 were used in two comparative examples.</p>
    <p num="205">It is evident from Tables 2 and 3 that the detergency boosters according to the invention of Examples 1-8 distinctly improve the single wash cycle performance of detergent formulations A and B, especially for cotton fabrics.</p>
    <p num="206">These compounds are likewise effective in other modern compact detergent formulations as listed in Table 1, for other types of soil such as lipstick or makeup, or on other test fabrics such as polyester fabrics or polyester-containing blended fabrics.</p>
