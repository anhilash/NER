      A vehicle closure testing apparatus for opening or closing a vehicle door of any of a variety of vehicles under test comprises a supporting structure, a door moving mechanism, and an assembly selectably configured to position the door moving structure.
      <br/>
      The supporting structure positions the vehicle closure testing apparatus in spaced relationship to the vehicle under test.
      <br/>
      The door moving mechanism engages and rotates the vehicle door when the door moving mechanism is activated.
      <br/>
      The assembly enables the door moving mechanism to be movably positioned into a functional position relative to a specific door of the variety of vehicle doors having a specific axis of rotation and enables the doors having a specific axis of rotation and enables the door moving mechanism to be repositioned in a similar functional position relative to a different vehicle door having a different axis of rotation.

    <p num="3">
      1.
      <br/>
      Scope of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The closure system testing apparatus described herein provides full vehicle testing of all body hardware closures.
      <br/>
      As explained in more detail below, the full vehicle test system according to the present invention simultaneously operates all handles and body closures in a manner that simulates human use of those handles and closures.
      <br/>
      In that regard, the system according to the present invention assures that no extraneous loads or added mass are imparted or added to the closures and handles.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The closure system testing apparatus can be configured to open and close the doors of any of a variety of vehicles thereby eliminating the need to customize a system for any particular vehicle.
      <br/>
      The apparatus incorporates modular and adjustable fixturing of various handle and closure actuators and cyclers attachable to various main and base frames.
      <br/>
      The ability to configure the apparatus, in turn, affords the system the ability to accommodate a wide range of vehicle sizes from compact vehicles to full size vans including pick-up trucks, avoiding the need to customize the apparatus to work with a particular vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="6">2. Prior Art</p>
    <p num="7">
      It has been known to provide a vehicle closure testing apparatus for opening and closing particular vehicle doors having a particular axis of rotation of a particular vehicle under test having a supporting structure providing support for the vehicle closure testing apparatus.
      <br/>
      These known supporting structures have been configured to be positioned either on the outside of the vehicle under test or within the interior of the vehicle under test.
      <br/>
      The known outside supporting structures have also been configured to allow a particular, fully-operational vehicle under test to be driven onto the outside supporting structure and to support the particular, fully-operational vehicle under test including the vehicle's wheels and suspension.
      <br/>
      The outside and inside supporting structures are positioned relative to the particular vehicle under test such that the supporting structure is in a spaced relationship to either the exterior surface or the interior surface of the particular vehicle door, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Such known closure systems testing apparatuses also include a door moving mechanism disposed on the supporting structure that engages the vehicle door and rotates the vehicle door in an opening direction or a closing direction when the door moving mechanism is activated.
      <br/>
      It has been known to use an outside door moving mechanism to both open and close the particular vehicle door, an inside door moving mechanism to both open and close the particular vehicle door, and both inside and outside door moving mechanisms to open and close the particular vehicle door.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      These known door moving mechanisms are movably disposed on the supporting structure at a position that enables the door moving mechanisms to engage an area of contact on the particular vehicle door and are designed to move in a first direction and a second direction counter to the first direction.
      <br/>
      The door moving mechanisms engage the area of contact on the particular vehicle door and move the door in either (or both) the opening direction and the closing direction such that the area of contact remains fixed while the door moving mechanism open and close the door.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The known vehicle closure testing apparatuses also include electric actuators operatively associated with the door moving mechanisms and cause the door moving mechanisms to engage and move the particular vehicle door in either (or both) the opening direction or the closing direction.
      <br/>
      The electric actuators are controlled by an electric actuator controller communicating with the electric actuators so as to transfer control signals to the electric actuators and to receive feedback signals indicative of door movements.
      <br/>
      The electric actuator controller can control the electric actuators to obtain a desired velocity profile in the movement of the particular vehicle door.

    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      As most will recognize, vehicles come in many sizes and configurations, including sub-compact through full-size vehicles, vans and pick-up trucks.
      <br/>
      Each particular door of the many of variety of vehicles has a particular axis of rotation about which the particular door rotates.
      <br/>
      The degree of inclination and position of an axis of rotation of one particular vehicle door is typically quite different from the inclination and position of another vehicle door.
      <br/>
      Thus, to test any particular door, a door moving mechanism must be designed and customized to move the particular door about the particular door axis.
      <br/>
      Yet with the variety of door configurations and the corresponding need to customize a test system for each particular door, it becomes expensive to be able to test all of the variety of vehicles.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Unfortunately, prior art vehicle closure testing apparatuses fail to address this limitation.
      <br/>
      Each prior art testing apparatus was customized to move a particular vehicle door.
      <br/>
      Each time a different door needed to be tested, a new testing apparatus had to be designed and customized to work with the different door.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      It is an object of the present invention to overcome the limitations of the prior art closure system testing apparatuses.
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="32">
      The foundation of the closure system testing (CST) apparatus is the system frame.
      <br/>
      As described below, the CST apparatus includes a main frame adapted to support a fully-operational vehicle under test.
      <br/>
      In other words, the frame is designed to allow a vehicle under test--fully equipped including suspension--to be driven onto the frame for closure testing.
      <br/>
      Once the vehicle under test is secured to the frame, the CST apparatus can simulate human closure of vehicle doors even though the doors may be subject to movement because they rest on the vehicle suspension.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      More particularly, the CST apparatus incorporates preferably three main frames, small, medium, and large, providing the structure upon which the actuation modules are attached.
      <br/>
      The three discrete frame sizes provide the ability to position the actuation modules substantially near the body closures for all sized vehicles.
      <br/>
      In the broadest concept of the invention, however, only a single frame need be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Moreover, The CST frame including a vehicle under test secured thereto is portable.
      <br/>
      The frame includes moving gears that lift the frame and vehicle under test on rollers thereby allowing the frame, modules and vehicle under test to be transported to different test locations.
      <br/>
      This feature of the frame allows the vehicle under test to be moved, for example, to a temperature chamber for cycling of closures at temperature extremes without having to move the vehicle under test to a second test frame and reconfiguring the modules.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The system according to the present invention also includes actuator modules controlled in a manner that simulates human use of vehicle closures without loading the closures with extraneous mass or force.
      <br/>
      The various actuation modules are adapted to be selectively attached at any three dimensional position relative to the vehicle under test on any of the frames.
      <br/>
      In that regard, therefore, the closure system test apparatus can accommodate any vehicle type irrespective of any particular location of handles and body closures.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The primary actuator modules are those modules that cycle vehicle doors.
      <br/>
      The term "door" is broader than just those closures that provide access to a vehicle cab.
      <br/>
      The door modules can be classified as vertically hinted door actuators, including for example, rear and side van door and automobile door actuators, and as horizontally hinted door actuators, including for example, hood and trunk actuators.
      <br/>
      Additionally, various door actuators are configured for cycling doors from an inside vehicle position, while others are configured for cycling doors from an outside vehicle position.
      <br/>
      The CST apparatus according to the present invention includes, as described in more detail below, the following door actuation modules:
    </p>
    <p num="37">VERTICALLY HINGED DOOR ACTUATORS:</p>
    <p num="38">
      - outside door actuator--90 degree rotation;
      <br/>

      All of the above-referenced modules are driven by linear or rotary actuators including, for example, electric and air cylinders and electric motors.
      <br/>
      The applicants have learned, however, that electric cylinders and motors are preferred over other actuators when more precise control over velocity profiles of door closures is required to simulate human closure of vehicle doors.
      <br/>
      For example, one test requirement may be to initially close a car door slowly then accelerate the door to slam it closed.
      <br/>
      To simulate such a velocity profile, electric actuators are preferred.
      <br/>
      Additionally, electric actuators are better suited for achieving repeatable test results at temperature extremes.
      <br/>
      Outputs of hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders vary as the temperature of the hydraulic oil and air varies.

      The CST apparatus also includes various handle and check load modules that cooperate with the door modules to complete a door cycle.
      <br/>
      For example, an outside door handle actuator would release a door latch by pulling an outside door handle prior to the outside door actuator cycling the door.
      <br/>
      Once the door actuator opened the door, a check load module would load the door checks.
      <br/>
      The following modules are representative of the modules that could be incorporated into the CST apparatus:
      <br/>
      check load actuator; and
      <br/>
      outside handle actuator.

      Of course, in the broadest concept of the invention, the actuation modules need only be sized for the largest expected load.
      <br/>
      Thus, as one skilled in the art will recognize readily, the modular nature of the closure system testing apparatus provides numerous configurations that can be adapted to the design of any particular vehicle or to the requirements of the user of the presently contemplated invention.

      Generally, the interior base frame 900 includes a support frame 902, a base plate 904 attached to the support frame 902, and a plurality of flanges 906 also attached to the support frame 902.
      <br/>
      The plurality of flanges 906 provide the points of attachment, preferably by mechanical fasteners, to fix the interior base frame 900 to the interior of the vehicle under test.

      It provides a mechanism for selectively engaging a door and opening the door as the outside door arm 2703 rotates in an opening direction.

      Specifically, the opening interface assembly 2767 comprises a pair of cylindrical brackets 2769 similar in construction to the previously defined cylindrical brackets.
      <br/>
      The cylindrical brackets 2769 include two mating semi-circular members defining a bore therethrough when positioned in the mating configuration.

      The cylindrical bracket 2769 is adapted to clamp to the vertical arm of the outside door arm 2703.

      A pair of bracket and bearing assemblies 2771 is attached, preferably by welding, to each of the cylindrical brackets 2769.

      More particularly, the pairs of cylindrical bearing brackets 2771 are welded on an outside surface of the cylindrical brackets 2769 and are positioned coaxially to each other.
      <br/>
      A shaft 2773 is rotatably mounted within the bearing brackets 2771 such that each of the bearings is aligned coaxially.
      <br/>
      A piston engaging arm 2775 is attached to the shaft 2773 between the pairs of bearings forming the upper bracket end bearing assembly 2771.
      <br/>
      The piston engaging arm 2775 defines a mounting hole at its free end for attachment to a piston 2777 of an air cylinder 2779.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a first door engaging arm 2781 is attached, preferably by welding to the shaft 2773 between the second pair of bearings 2771.
      <br/>
      A cylindrical bracket 2783 identical to the previously described brackets is attached, preferably by welding to the free end of the first door engaging arm 2781.

      A second door engaging arm 2785 is clamped within the bracket 2783 of the first door engaging arm 2781 and extends perpendicularly therefrom.

      A cylindrical bracket 2787, again of the previously described design, is fixed, preferably by welding, to the free end of the second door engaging arm 2785.
      <br/>
      A third door engaging arm 2789 is clamped within the cylindrical bracket 2787 of the second door engaging arm 2785.
      <br/>
      As configured, each of the door engaging arms are substantially perpendicular to its adjoining arm, and the first and third door engaging arms 2781, 2789 are substantially parallel.
      <br/>
      All of the door engaging arms are substantially coplanar.
      <br/>
      Thus, rotation of the piston engaging arm 2775 causes the shaft 2773 to rotate about the bracket and bearing assemblies 2771 thereby causing the door engaging arms to rotate.

      A cylinder mounting plate 2791 is attached, preferably by welding to the upper cylindrical bracket 2769.

      An air cylinder 2779 is fixed to the plate 2791 such that its piston 2777 extends towards the piston engaging arm 2775.

      The free end of the air cylinder piston 2777 is attached pivotally to the piston engaging arm 2775.

      Once the outside door actuator is aligned properly, as described above, and a door cycle has commenced (assuming the beginning of the cycle starts from a closed position and the door latch has been released), the cylinder 2779 of the opening interface assembly 2767 retracts its extensible piston 2777 to rotate the shaft 2773 in a counterclockwise direction.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the engaging arm 2789 engages and hooks onto the door under test.
      <br/>
      At this stage, the driver 2731 extends its piston to rotate the door arm 2703 and, consequently, the door under test to a full open position.
      <br/>
      At the end of the opening cycle, the opening interface assembly releases the door by retraction of the piston 2777.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the driver 2731 retracts its piston and rotates the door arm 2703 in a closing direction.
      <br/>
      The roller 2761 of the closing interface assembly engages the door and closes the door under test.
      <br/>
      The speed and/or acceleration of the retraction of the piston is controlled to simulate human closure of the door.
      <br/>
      Once the door under test reaches the desired closing speed, the driver 2731 slows down before impact with the door.
      <br/>
      Because the roller 2761 is not attached to the door under test, however, the door under test continues to rotate to closure.

      <br/>
      Specifically, the actuator mounting assembly 2905 can be positioned laterally along the horizontal member of the rearward or forward frame member or the longitudinal member by securing the upper motor bracket 2907 to the proper position on the main frame.
      <br/>
      If required, once the lateral position of the upper pivot is secured, the position of the vehicle under test can be shifted longitudinally along the vehicle supports and laterally by adjustment of the vehicle supports and then secured once the upper pivot is coaxial with the axis of rotation of the door under test.

      As shown in FIG. 30, the closing interface assembly 2947 comprises a roller arm 2949, preferably constructed from steel tube, and a roller 2951 rotatably mounted to one end of the arm 2949.
      <br/>
      The end defines holes through opposed surfaces of the tube positioned cross-axially in end of the roller arm 2949.

      The roller 2951 is mounted rotatably to the arm 2949 by a mechanical fastener passing through the holes.
      <br/>
      The roller 2951 should have a diameter sufficiently large such that the roller 2951 extends past the end of the arm 2949.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the roller 2951 should be reasonably pliable; a suitable roller 2951 is a DURASOFT roller -DR-754-20 or equivalent.

      <br/>
      The door arm 2903 should be controlled, as described in more detail below, so that the door arm 2903 does not crash into a fully closed and latched door under test.

      It provides a mechanism for selectively engaging a door and opening the door as the outside door arm 2903 rotates in an opening direction.

      <br/>
      All of the door engaging arms are substantially co-planar.
      <br/>
      Thus, rotation of the piston engaging arm 2961 causes the shaft 2959 to rotate about the bracket and bearing assemblies 2957 thereby causing the door engaging arms to rotate.

      A cylinder mounting plate 2966 is attached, preferably by welding to the upper cylindrical bracket.

      Once the 180 degree, outside door actuator is aligned properly, as described above, and a door cycle has commenced (assuming the beginning of the cycle starts from a closed position and the door latch has been released), the cylinder 2965 of the opening interface assembly 2955 retracts its extensible piston 2963 to rotate the shaft 2959 in a counterclockwise direction.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the engaging arm 2971 engages and hooks onto the door under test.
      <br/>
      At this stage, the driver 2943 rotates the door arm 2903 and, consequently, the door under test to a full open position.
      <br/>
      At the end of the opening cycle, the opening interface assembly releases the door by retraction of the piston 2963.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the driver 2943 rotates the door arm 2903 in a closing direction.
      <br/>
      The roller 2951 of the closing interface assembly engages the door and closes the door under test.
      <br/>
      The speed and/or acceleration of the driver 2943 is controlled to simulate human closure of the door.
      <br/>
      Once the door under test reaches the desired closing speed, the driver 2943 slows down before causing the arm 2903 to impact the door.
      <br/>
      Because the roller 2951 is not attached to the door under test, however, the door under test continues to rotate to closure.

      As discussed below, each angle of the triangular members provides a pivot point for the linkage assembly 3302.
      <br/>
      As one skilled in the art will recognize readily upon further review of this description, the triangular members are conveniently constructed in a triangular shape and could, however, be constructed in any other geometric shape as long as three pivot points are maintained.

      Similarly, a second straight linkage member 3362 is disposed pivotally on the triangular members 3340, 3342.
      <br/>
      Specifically, one end 3370 of the second straight linkage member 3362 is pivotally mounted to the bearing 3358 of the base 3346 of the inside triangular member 3342.

      <br/>
      Consequently, any contact between the door-engaging linkage member and the door under test does not shift as the door is rotated.
      <br/>
      This configuration allows the door actuator 3500 to engage a door under test at a single location on the door for all points of door rotation and prevents relative motion between the door under test and the door-engaging linkage member 3534.
    </p>
    <p num="166">
      As shown in FIG. 46, the door-engaging linkage member 3534 extends laterally from the roller bearings 3536, 3538.
      <br/>
      This additional length provides suitable points for attaching door interface assemblies.
      <br/>
      As one skilled in the art will recognize readily, the 180-degree inside door actuator 3500 can be adapted to open or close vertically hinged doors from an inside position.
      <br/>
      A door opening assembly 3550 comprises a roller 3552 mounted rotatably to one end of an arm 3554.
      <br/>
      Any roller that can engage a door without imparting damage thereto may be incorporated.
      <br/>
      A four inch roller is preferred for this application.
      <br/>
      The other end of the arm 3554 defines a slot 3556 through which a mechanical fastener passes and fixes the roller arm 3554 to the door-engaging linkage member 3534.
      <br/>
      The slot 3556 provides both linear and rotational positioning of the roller 3552 relative to the door-engaging linkage member 3534.
      <br/>
      As the door-engaging linkage member 3534 rotates, the roller 3552 engages the door under test and pushes it open.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      Several door closing assemblies are provided.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 47, a first door closing device 3560 comprises a strap and hook assembly that hooks onto a door handle of the door under test.
      <br/>
      One end of the strap is fixed to the door-engaging linkage member 3534 by a clamp plate 3562.
      <br/>
      The strap is disposed between the clamp 3562 and the door-engaging linkage member 3534 and is fixed thereto by clamping the plate 3562 secured by mechanical fasteners.
      <br/>
      The other end of the strap is connected to a hook 3564 suitable for grabbing a door handle.
      <br/>
      As the door-engaging linkage member 3534 rotates in a closing direction, the strap and hook assembly pulls the door under test closed.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      As shown in FIG. 48, a second door closing device 3570 is provided for doors lacking convenient places for attaching the hook 3564.
      <br/>
      The second door closing device 3570 comprises a pivotally mounted arm 3572 disposed on the door-engaging linkage member 3534.
      <br/>
      The pivotally mounted arm 3572 is attached to the linkage member 3534 by conventional means.
      <br/>
      An air cylinder 3574 having an extensible piston also mounted to the door engaging linkage member 3534 by conventional means is operatively connected to the pivotally mounted arm 3572.
      <br/>
      As the piston of the air cylinder 3574 is extended or retracted, the pivotally mounted arm 3572 rotates into or out of engagement with the door under test.
      <br/>
      Specifically, as the piston of the air cylinder 3574 is extended, an L-shaped portion 3576 of the arm 3572 rotates into position behind the edge of the door under test.
      <br/>
      When the door-engaging linkage member 3534 rotates in a closing direction, the L-shaped portion 3576 of the arm 3572 pulls the door to closure.
      <br/>
      Once the door is fully closed, the piston of the air cylinder 3574 retracts and thereby rotates the arm 3572 out of engagement with the door under test.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      Thus, a complete cycle of the 180-degree inside door actuator 3500 can be described as follows.
      <br/>
      Assuming the door under test is initially in a fully closed position, the door under test is first unlatched (any mechanism that can unlatch the door, including those described below, may be incorporated).
      <br/>
      Once the system receives confirmation that the door is unlatched, the motor 3504 begins rotating in an opening direction (depending upon the relative position of the actuator 3500 to the door under test, the direction of rotation may be counterclockwise or clockwise).
      <br/>
      As stated above, the fixed sprocket 3512 and chain 3528 remain fixed and do not rotate.
      <br/>
      By comparison, however, the electric motor 3504 rotates the rotating plate 3514 in an opening direction.
      <br/>
      Such rotation causes the freely rotating sprockets 3520 to roll along the fixed chain 3528 as described above.
      <br/>
      By virtue of their connection the freely rotating sprockets 3520, the parallel linkage members 3532 rotate about the axes of their associated sprocket.
      <br/>
      Additionally, since the plate 3514 to which the parallel members 3532 are connected orbits about the motor axis, the parallel members 3532 also rotate about the motor axis.
      <br/>
      Thus, with this configuration, the two isosceles triangles 3524, 3542 formed by the linkage assembly 3502 rotate in parallel but displaced arcs.
      <br/>
      As described above, this configuration causes the door-engaging rotation that is coaxial with the door's rotation.
      <br/>
      The roller 3552 of the door-engaging linkage assembly 3534 contacts the door under test at a single point and pushes the door in an opening direction as the rotating plate 3514 is rotated in an opening direction.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      Thereafter, one of the door closing assemblies engages the door under test as described above.
      <br/>
      The electric motor 3504 reverses and begins rotating in a closing direction and the door under test is pulled closed.

      This configuration is particularly necessary when the vehicle under test is cycled at extreme temperatures.

      While air cylinders may be used, they are subject to varied outputs as the ambient temperature changes.

      Initially, the lift plate 4194 of the lift hand assembly 4106 is extended towards the released hood such that it engages an edge of the hood.
      <br/>
      The cylinder 4188 extends the lift plate 4194.
      <br/>
      Once the lift plate has engaged the hood, the cylinder 4108 is activated to rotate the arm 4110 in an opening direction.
      <br/>
      Once the hood has reached a full-open position, further extension of the piston of the cylinder 4108 is stopped.
    </p>
    <p num="190">
      Thereafter, the roller 4168 is rotated into engagement with the hood as the piston 4178 of the cylinder 4178 is extended.
      <br/>
      Specifically, as the piston 4178 extends, the crank 4170 is rotated until the roller 4168 engages the hood under test.
      <br/>
      Next, the lift plate 4194 is retracted out of engagement with the hood.
      <br/>
      Once positioned, the cylinder 4108 retracts its piston to rotate the arm 4110 in a closing direction.
      <br/>
      The cylinder piston is retracted at a rate that will simulate human door closure.
      <br/>
      By virtue of the roller's 4168 contact with the door under test, the rotation of the arm 4110 will close the hood.
      <br/>
      Over-rotation of the arm is prevented by proper control of the cylinder 4108.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the bumper 4140 prevents over-rotation.
      <br/>
      The damper 4138 dampens any shock loading associated with any impact by the arm 4110 against the bumper 4140.

      This configuration is particularly necessary when the vehicle under test is cycled at extreme temperatures.

      While air cylinders may be used, they are subject to varied outputs as the ambient temperature changes.

      The free-fall hood actuator 4300 also includes the bumper 4338 and the damper 4336 constructed and arranged substantially identically as in the assisted hood actuator 4100.
      <br/>
      Because a free-fall hood is dropped to closure rather than actively pushed to closure, however, there is generally less lift arm energy to dissipate by the damper 4336.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the bumper 4338 and damper 4336 plays a more important role in the assisted hood actuator 4100.
    </p>
    <p num="205">
      The free-fall hood actuator 4300, however, also comprises preferably a stop cylinder assembly 4390.
      <br/>
      A stop cylinder mount plate 4392, which can also be seen in FIG. 57, is fixed, preferably by mechanical fasteners, to the lift arm actuator 4306 and provides a mounting surface spaced laterally from the lift arm cylinder 4306.
      <br/>
      A stop cylinder 4394 having an extensible piston is fixed to the mount plate 4392 such that the stop cylinder 4394 is substantially parallel with the lift arm cylinder 4306 and such that the stop cylinder piston extends in the same direction as the piston of the lift arm cylinder 4306.
      <br/>
      A suitable stop cylinder 4394 is a SMC NCA1R250 or equivalent.
    </p>
    <p num="206">
      Once the lift arm 4302 and lift hand assembly 4304 have lifted the free-fall hood under test to its full open position, the stop cylinder 4394 extends its piston to a desired drop height.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the lift arm cylinder 4306 rotates the lift arm 4302 and lift hand 4304 in a closing direction until the stop cylinder abutment 4384 engages the end of the extended piston of the stop cylinder 4394.
      <br/>
      Thus, the stop cylinder abutment 4384 must be positioned across the longitudinal axis of the stop cylinder 4394, and the extension of the stop cylinder 4394 must be sufficiently long to cover all expected drop heights, as described below.
      <br/>
      The stop cylinder 4394 is extended to a predetermined length that sets the drop height of the hood under test to a predetermined value.
      <br/>
      In other words, the lift arm 4302 can only rotate in a closing direction until the stop cylinder abutment 4384 engages the piston of the stop cylinder 4394 thereby preventing further rotation of the arm 4302 and positioning the arm 4302 at some height above full closure.
      <br/>
      At the predetermined height, the lift hand 4304 is retracted and the hood under test is allowed to free fall through the predetermined height.
    </p>
    <p num="207">
      The stop cylinder 4394 provides the preferred method of setting the hood drop height.
      <br/>
      Sensors or limit switches, for example, could be used to indicate drop height and initiate free fall.
      <br/>
      Such a process, however, would not provide accurate control over drop height at temperature extremes.
      <br/>
      As the lift arm 4302 rotated the hood under test towards closure, the lift hand 4378, retracted by an air cylinder 4374, would respond in times that varied with temperature thereby varying the drop height.
      <br/>
      For example, if the lift hand 4378 took longer to fully retract--because of a temperature variation--following free-fall initiation while the lift arm 4302 was rotated, the drop height would be lowered.
      <br/>
      Thus, it would be difficult to release the hood under test at the same drop height for tests at different temperature extremes.

      The stiffness of the element 4537 is such that the element 4537 can adequately support the weight of the cylinder assembly 4535 without being fully compressed.

      This configuration is particularly necessary when the vehicle under test is cycled at extreme temperatures.
      <br/>
      While air cylinders may be used, they are subject to varied outputs as the ambient temperature changes.

      More particularly, the chain 1520 extends from the air cylinder spring assembly 1522 along the center line of the air cylinder 1502 to the leading toothed surface of the idler sprocket 1512 and thereafter extends downwardly to the outside handle base 1524.
      <br/>
      The outside handle base 1524 is fixed to the door handle.
    </p>
    <p num="256">
      The outside handle base 1524 comprises a C-shaped bracket 1526, preferably constructed from aluminum, and a rod and spacer assembly 1528, preferably constructed from acetal resin or its equivalent including, for example DELRIN, mounted within the C-shaped bracket 1526.
      <br/>
      More particularly, as can be seen in FIG. 74, the C-shaped bracket 1526 includes a perpendicular portion disposed between two parallel portions.
      <br/>
      The C-shaped bracket 1526 includes a hole through the perpendicular portion through which a mechanical fastener passes to attach the chain 1520 to the C-shaped bracket 1526.
      <br/>
      Each of the parallel portions define a hole therethrough; the hole through the lower parallel portion, however, is aligned perpendicularly to the other holes.

      The rod 1530 has a tapped bore within a substantial portion of its length and has a diameter larger than the thickness of the lower parallel portion.

      The rod 1530 is fixed to the lower parallel portion by a mechanical fastener and extends perpendicularly to the other holes.
      <br/>
      As can be seen in FIG. 75, a spacer 1532 is positioned between the parallel portion coaxially with the hole of the upper parallel portion.
      <br/>
      The spacer 1532 is biased towards the rod 1530 by a bolt threaded in the hole of the upper parallel portion.
      <br/>
      As assembled to a handle of a door under test, the spacer 1532 is biased towards the outside surface of a horizontally hinged handle thereby clamping the handle between the spacer 1532 and the rod 1530.

    <p num="257">
      The spring assembly 1522 comprises a conventional extension spring 1534 that allows relative movement between the air cylinder piston 1504 and the chain 1520.
      <br/>
      A suitable extension spring 1534 is a McMaster-Carr -9630K1 or equivalent.
      <br/>
      Generally, the extension spring 1534 must have a spring constant that will produce a force sufficient to open the outside door handle of the vehicle under test.
      <br/>
      The spring 1534 is disposed coaxially and coextensively with the piston 1504 of the air cylinder 1502.
      <br/>
      One end of the extension spring 1534 is connected to the chain 1520 while the other end abuts the air cylinder 1502.
      <br/>
      As configured, upon engagement of the air cylinder 1502 in a retracting direction, the extension spring 1534 is biased allowing the air cylinder piston 1504 to move relatively to the chain 1534.
      <br/>
      During the stroke of the piston 1504, the extension spring 1534 is also biased by a door handle load on the chain 1520 until the point where the spring force overcomes the door handle load.
      <br/>
      At such a point, continued retraction of the air cylinder piston 1504 pulls the chain 1520 and outside handle base 1524.
    </p>
    <p num="258">
      As configured, the extension spring assembly 1522 provides relative movement between the air cylinder piston 1504 and the chain 1520.
      <br/>
      This relative movement assures that constant tension is provided on the chain 1520 and takes up chain slack.
      <br/>
      Indeed, once the latch of the door under test is released, the door seal biases the door in an opening direction.
      <br/>
      During this time, the door may lead the chain 1520 thereby imparting slack to the chain 1520.
      <br/>
      Without the extension spring 1534, the actuator 1500 would open the handle of the door under test, allow the handle to close as slack formed in the chain 1520, and then jerk the handle open again as the chain 1520 and air cylinder piston 1504 caught up.
      <br/>
      However, the extension spring 1534 biases the chain 1520 to take up the slack such that the chain 1520 remains in tension.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the chain-tensioning capability of the extension spring 1534 prevents jerk-type loading on the door handle which would otherwise occur after the chain 1520 catches up with the leading door.
      <br/>
      In that regard, therefore, the outside door handle actuator 1500 is able to simulate the constant and uniform pull of a human opening the door handle.
    </p>
    <p num="259">
      The outside door handle actuator 1500 is provided preferably in two configurations.
      <br/>
      In the first configuration, the air cylinder 1502 is sized for smaller handle loads and smaller doors.
      <br/>
      As such, the first configuration is adapted typically for use with the small main frame 100.
      <br/>
      In the second configuration, the air cylinder 1502 is sized for larger handle loads and larger doors.
      <br/>
      As such, the second configuration is adapted typically for use with the medium mainframe 300 and large mainframe 500 since those frames usually are used with larger vehicles.

    <heading>SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="269">
      The CST apparatus operates as a system to simultaneously cycle all vehicle closures (1) without loading the vehicle under test with extraneous mass or force in a manner that simulates human use and (2) on a portable platform that allows the vehicle under test to be transported to different test locations without the need for reconfiguration.
      <br/>
      The configuration and operation of the frames and actuation modules are described above.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 81, the actuation modules and frames are only one part of the total CST system and are represented collectively by the TEST FIXTURE block.
    </p>
    <p num="270">
      Central to the control and operation of the CST system is a programmable logic controller (PLC) represented by a block of the same name.
      <br/>
      The PLC is a matter of design choice and can be either a computer, for example a PC or workstation, or a dedicated controller.
      <br/>
      Any controller having sufficient outputs to control the expected number of relays and air valve banks is acceptable.
      <br/>
      A PLC program, adapted, of course, for use on the selected controller, provides the control algorithms, discussed below, for operation of the CST system.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the PLC should include an OPERATOR GRAPHICAL INTERFACE (OGI) that provides the user with, at least, the current number of door cycles and the total number of door cycles.
      <br/>
      Such a graphical interface is shown in FIG. 82. As shown in FIG. 83, the OGI should provide preferably a screen indicating the status of PLC inputs and outputs.
      <br/>
      Such inputs and outputs would include door open/closed status, door actuator extended/retracted status, and handle and/or lock status (if such actuators are used).
    </p>
    <p num="271">
      Again as shown in FIG. 81, the PLC output controls a RELAY BANK and an AIR VALVE BANK.
      <br/>
      The relay bank contains a plurality of relays, the number of which is determined by the number of modules, for activating or energizing the actuation modules.
      <br/>
      The relay bank is powered by a DC POWER SUPPLY.
      <br/>
      As described below the relay bank is connected to a WIRING JUNCTION BOX.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the air valve bank contains a plurality of air valves, the number of which is determined by the number of air cylinders used, for operating the air cylinders.
      <br/>
      The air valve bank is connected to the test fixture.
    </p>
    <p num="272">
      Since the object of the CST system is to simulate human closure of vehicle doors, as described above, electric actuators are most suitably incorporated into the CST system because they provide the best control over velocity profiles of door closure.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the PLC is interfaced to an ELECTRIC ACTUATOR CONTROLLER.
      <br/>
      The electric actuator controller is connected to the wiring junction box.
    </p>
    <p num="273">
      Any electric actuator that can output a velocity profile necessary to cycle a vehicle door in a manner that simulates human closure of a door is acceptable.
      <br/>
      The electric actuator should be able to accelerate a door under test to higher velocity levels to slam the door as well as provide substantially constant velocity closure of doors.
      <br/>
      Industrial Devices Corporation H3301 series electric actuators are suitable for this application.
      <br/>
      Such actuators incorporate travel limit switches to detect the linear or rotary position of the actuator.
      <br/>
      The electric actuator controller provides the interface between the PLC and the electric actuator for the transfer of control and feedback signals.
    </p>
    <p num="274">
      The wiring junction box and the air valve bank are provide with quick disconnects of any suitable make or design that allow easy disconnection of the test fixture from and reconnection to the remaining CST system.
      <br/>
      As configured, the test fixture can be disconnected from the PLC and transported to a different test site on the moving gears and thereafter be reconnected at the new site, for example, a temperature chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="275">
      FIGS. 84 through 89 show in flow chart form the algorithms used by the PLC program to control the test fixture.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 84, following system power up and initial test set-up, the PLC program provides the option of cycling the test fixture in automatic or manual mode.
      <br/>
      Once the PLC receives confirmation of automatic cycling, the automatic test cycle begins.
      <br/>
      Initially, the PLC program determines whether the door under test will be cycled form the inside or outside of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      FIG. 84 shows the program control for an outside door actuator, while FIG. 85 shows the program control for an inside door actuator.
      <br/>
      Generally in both cases, the door window is cycled (if such an actuator is being utilized), the door lock is then cycled (again, if such an actuator is utilized), the door latch is released by activation of either an inside handle actuator or an outside handle actuator, as applicable, the door is pulled or pushed open, as applicable, and finally, the door is pulled or pushed closed, as applicable.
      <br/>
      Once the PLC receives confirmation that the door is closed, the program increments a cycle count.
      <br/>
      In the final step, the PLC program checks the cycle count with a pre-programmed full count and either stops the cycling if the cycle count equals the full count or continues cycling if the cycle count is less than the full count.
    </p>
    <p num="276">
      FIGS. 84 and 85 only show the flow control for a single door.
      <br/>
      One skilled in the art will appreciate that the PLC can control multiple doors simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p num="277">
      FIG. 86 shows the program flow for a window actuator.
      <br/>
      The PLC program checks the cycle count and verifies that the door is closed prior to cycling the window under test.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the window position is determined so that a full cycle of the window can be performed.
      <br/>
      After the window is cycled, the cycle count is incremented.
      <br/>
      The PLC program exits from the window cycle when the cycle count reaches a pre-programmed level.
    </p>
    <p num="278">
      FIG. 87 shows the program flow for a lock actuator.
      <br/>
      As with the window cycle program, the PLC program checks the cycle count and verifies that the door is closed prior to cycling the door lock under test.
      <br/>
      The PLC program verifies the lock type--key, power, or night or plunger type lock--and thereafter cycles the lock.
      <br/>
      Program control then passes to either an outside or inside handle control as applicable.
    </p>
    <p num="279">FIGS. 88 and 89 show the program flow control for an outside and inside handle actuator, respectively.</p>
    <p num="280">
      One skilled in the art will recognize readily that the sequence of program flow control can proceed in orders other than that described above (except, of course, a door latch of a latched door must be released before the door is opened).
      <br/>
      Additionally, windows and locks can be cycled in batch prior to cycling the door, or they can be cycled incrementally each time the door is cycled.
