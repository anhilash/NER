    <p num="5">
      Prostaglandins or prostanoids (PG) are a group of biologically active compounds derived from membrane phospholids and are formed from certain polyunsaturated fatty acids.
      <br/>
      They fall into several main classes designated by letters including D, E, F, G, H, and I (prostacyclin).
      <br/>
      The main classes are further subdivided as indicated by subscripts 1, 2, or 3, which reflect the fatty acid precursor, for example PGE1 or PGE2.
      <br/>
      Prostanoids are ubiquitously produced and the rate of their production usually increases in response to diverse stimuli.
      <br/>
      They thereby exhibit a wide variety of pharmacological properties.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The diversity of effects of prostanoids can be explained by the existence of a number of distinct receptors that mediate their action.
      <br/>
      The receptors have been named for the natural prostaglandin for which they have the greatest affinity and have been divided into five main types, designated as DP (PGD2), FP (PG2 ALPHA  ), IP (PGI2), TP (TXA2), AND EP (PGE2).
      <br/>
      Additional information relating to prostaglandins and their receptors are described in Goodman &amp; Gillman's, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, ninth edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996, Chapter 26, pages 601-616.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Prostanoids are generated by most cells in response to mechanical, thermal or chemical injury and inflammatory insult, and are responsible for the sensitization or direct activation of nearby sensory nerve endings.
      <br/>
      The hyperalgesic effects (an increased responsiveness to a stimulus that is normally painful) of several prostanoids have been reported in several inflammatory models of nociception.
      <br/>
      Even though PGE2 has attained wide recognition as the primary mediator of hyperalgesia, significant quantities of other prostanoids, including PGI2, are released by injury or inflammation.
      <br/>
      Indeed, when the effects of PGE2 and PGI2 on sensory neurons are compared directly, PGI2 is equally or more effective as a hyperalgesic or sensitizing agent both in vivo and in vitro assays.
      <br/>
      However, to date, there have been no selective receptor antagonists which could unequivocally characterize the prostanoid receptor subtype(s) that mediate the sensitizing effects of PGE2 or PGI2.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      When the intrinsic instability and pharmacokinetic properties of PGI2 are taken into account, a preponderance of in vivo analgesia studies in rodents suggest that PGI2 plays a major role in the induction of hyperalgesia.
      <br/>
      Likewise, in vitro studies provide substantial evidence to suggest that IP receptors act as important modulators of sensory neuron function.
      <br/>
      Since IP receptors in sensory neurons are coupled to activation of both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C, and hence, cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, these receptors can exert powerful effects on ion channel activity and thus neurotransmitter release.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Recent compelling evidence for a prominent role for IP (PGI2 -preferring) receptors in inflammatory pain has been obtained from recent studies in transgenic mice lacking the IP receptor (T.
      <br/>
      Murata et al., Nature 1997, 388, 678-682).
      <br/>
      In these animals, the acetic acid-induced writhing response or the carrageenan-induced paw edema was reduced to levels similar to those seen with administration of indomethacin in wild-type mice.
      <br/>
      In contrast, spinal nociceptive reflexes measured by the tail-flick and hot-plate test were normal.
      <br/>
      The modest writhing response induced by PGE2 was unchanged in the transgenic animals.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Based upon these observations, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be effective anti-nociceptive agents.</p>
    <p num="11">
      In addition to being mediators of hyperalgesia, prostanoids are known to be generated locally in the bladder in response to physiologic stimuli such as stretch of the detrusor smooth muscle, injuries of the vesical mucosa, and nerve stimulation (K.
      <br/>
      Anderson, Pharmacological Reviews 1993, 45(3), 253-308).
      <br/>
      PGI2 is the major prostanoid released from the human bladder.
      <br/>
      Several lines of evidence suggest that prostanoids may be the link between detrusor muscle stretch produced by bladder filling and activation of C-fiber afferents by bladder distension.
      <br/>
      It has been proposed that prostanoids may be involved in the pathophysiology of bladder disorders, e.g., bladder outlet obstruction, and conditions associated with urinary incontinence such as urge incontinence, stress incontinence, and bladder hyperreactivity.
      <br/>
      Therefore, antagonists of prostanoid IP receptors are expected to be useful in the treatment of such conditions.

      Different polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility.
      <br/>
      Recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to dominate.

      (b) Solvates are generally a crystal form that contains either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent.
      <br/>
      Often, during the process of crystallization some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate.
      <br/>
      When the solvent is water, hydrates may be formed.
      <br/>
      (c) Amorphous forms are noncrystalline materials with no long range order and generally do not give a distinctive powder X-ray diffraction pattern.

      <br/>
      (2) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting the development of the disease or its clinical symptoms, or
      <br/>
      (3) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease or its clinical symptoms.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      A "therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of a compound that, when administered to a mammal for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease.

    <p num="511">The anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity of compounds of this invention was determined by the Carrageenan-Induced Mechanical Hyperalgesia Assay by measuring the inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw hyperalgesia in the rat, using a modification of the method described in L. O. Randall and J. J. Selitto, Archives of International Pharmacodynamics, 1957, 11, 409-419, and Vinegar et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1969, 166, 96-103.</p>
    <p num="512">
      Male Sprague-Dawley rats (130-150 g) were weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups (n=1 0).
      <br/>
      To induce mechanical hyperalgesia, rats were lightly anesthetized with halothane and administered 1% carrageenan or vehicle 1 (100  MU l) in the plantar surface of the left hindpaw.
      <br/>
      Rats were administered vehicle (10 ml/kg, p.o.or 1 ml/kg, i.v) or compounds of this invention (at 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) or (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 10mg/kg, i.v.) one hour before testing.
      <br/>
      Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured using an Analgesy-meter (UGO BASILE, Biological Research Apparatus, Comerio, Italy).
      <br/>
      The vehicle- or carrageenan-treated hindpaw was placed on the dome of the apparatus, plantar surface facing down.
      <br/>
      A constantly increasing force was then applied to the dorsal surface of the paw.
      <br/>
      The force at which the rat withdrew its paw, struggled, or vocalized was considered the end point.

      Treatment groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance on the paw withdrawal force (RESP).
      <br/>
      Pairwise comparisons for the drug-treated groups to the vehicle group were made using Fisher's LSD strategy and Dunn's procedure.
      <br/>
      Percent inhibition of mechanical hyperalgesia was calculated for each animal, and the average ID50 value was estimated using the following sigmoidal model:
      <br/>
      % inhibition=100/(1+exp ((ID50 -dose)/N))

    <p num="534">
      Septic shock, sometimes referred to as endotoxic shock, is caused by the presence of infectious agents, particularly bacterial endotoxins, in the bloodstream and is characterized by hypotension and organ dysfunction.
      <br/>
      Many symptoms of septic shock, in particular, hypotension, are induced in the rat by the administration of bacterial endotoxins.
      <br/>
      The ability of a compound to inhibit endotoxin-induced hypotension is therefore predictive of the utility of the compound in the treatment of septic or endotoxic shock.
