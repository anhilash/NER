    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to compositions and methods of sanitizing and moisturizing skin surfaces.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Today's consumers are well acquainted with the notion of germs and germ transmission.
      <br/>
      Daily, people come into contact with germs at eating establishments, the gym, while changing diapers or using portable toilet facilities (e.g., portapotties).
      <br/>
      Once in contact with human hands, these germs (i.e., micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungus and/or viruses) are quickly passed from individual to individual and, thus, contribute to the spread of contagious and/or infectious diseases.
      <br/>
      One of the best and easiest ways of preventing such germ and/or disease transmission is by routinely and conscientiously washing one's hands.
      <br/>
      Recognizing the inconvenience or impossibility of such hand washing under certain traveling conditions and/or time constraints, a number of manufacturers have introduced hand sanitizing products which sanitize skin surfaces without the need for water and/or towels.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Although current hand sanitizing products kill the germs associated with such routine activities as changing diapers or handling exercise equipment, they can fail at adequately moisturizing the skin.
      <br/>
      Attempts at providing such moisturization have involved the use of lipophilic materials such as petrolatum.
      <br/>
      However, skin compositions incorporating such materials typically leave the skin feeling greasy or heavy.
      <br/>
      The present inventors have found that skin sanitizing compositions comprising lipophilic moisturizing agents and a degreasing agent provide excellent moisturization with improved skin feel.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Therefore, an important aspect of the present invention is to provide skin sanitizing compositions providing moisturization and improved skin feel.</p>
    <p num="6">Another aspect of the present invention is to provide skin sanitizing compositions comprising lipophilic moisturizing agents and a degreasing agent.</p>
    <p num="7">One other aspect of the present invention is to provide instant, hand sanitizing compositions comprising lipophilic moisturizing agents and a degreasing agent selected from the group consisting of select silicones, wax materials having a melting point above about 20 (degree)  C., powders, fluorochemicals and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="8">These and other aspects will become readily apparent from the detailed description which follows.</p>

    <p num="127">Methods for Disinfecting and Moisturizing the Skin</p>
    <p num="128">
      The skin sanitizing compositions of the present invention are useful for moisturizing and sanitizing the skin.
      <br/>
      Generally, the skin disinfection and moisturing process involves topically applying to the skin a safe and effective amount of a composition of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The present invention can be used when cleansing processes requiring soap and water are unavailable or inconvenient or, alternatively, applied and rinsed off with water.
      <br/>
      The amount of the composition applied, the frequency of application and the period of use will vary widely depending upon the level of disinfection and moisturization desired, e.g., the degree of microbial contamination and/or degree of skin dryness.
      <br/>
      Typical amounts of skin sanitizing composition used preferably range from about 0.1 mg/cm2 to about 20 mg/cm2, more preferably from about 0.5 mg/cm2 to about 10 mg/cm2, and most preferably about 1 mg/cm2 to about 5 mg/cm2 of skin area to be cleansed.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the skin sanitizing compositions of the present invention are used to sanitize and moisturize human and/or animal hands and/or feet.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      When additional actives are present, the compositions of the present invention can be applied by use of a patch.
      <br/>
      Such an approach is particularly useful for problem skin areas needing more intensive treatment or for the transderamal delivery of drugs.
      <br/>
      The patch can be occlusive, semi-occlusive or non-occlusive.
      <br/>
      The compositions and actives of the present invention can be contained within the patch or be applied to the skin prior to application of the patch.
      <br/>
      The patch can also include additional actives such as chemical initiators for exothermic reactions such as those described in PCT application WO 9701313 to Burkett et al.
      <br/>
      Preferably the patch is applied at night as a form of night therapy.
      <br/>
