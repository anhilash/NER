      A toner for developing an electrostatic image is formed of toner particles; wherein each toner particle includes (i) 100 wt. parts of a binder resin having a glass transition point (Tg) of 50-70° C., (ii) 0.2-20 wt. parts of solid wax, and (iii) colorant particles or magnetic powder, (iv) lubricant particles carrying a liquid lubricant, so that the toner particle retains at its surface the liquid lubricant gradually released from the particles (iv).
      <br/>
      The toner may be further blended with an organically treated inorganic fine powder to provide a developer.
      <br/>
      The toner or developer retains good lubricity and releasability so that it is suitable to be used in an image forming method including means contacting a latent image-bearing means, such as a contact charging means, a contact transfer means or a contact cleaning means.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a toner and a developer for developing electrostatic images used in image forming methods, such as electrophotography, electrostatic recording and magnetic recording, a process for production thereof, and an image forming method.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Hitherto, a large number of electrophotographic processes have been known, inclusive of those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,297,691; 3,666,363; and 4,071,361.
      <br/>
      In these processes, in general, an electrostatic latent image is formed on a photosensitive member comprising a photoconductive material by various means, then the latent image is developed with a toner, and the resultant toner image is, after being transferred onto a transfer material such as paper, as desired, fixed by heating, pressing, or heating and pressing, or with solvent vapor to obtain a copy.
      <br/>
      The residual toner on the photosensitive member without being transferred is cleaned as desired by various methods, and then the above steps are repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Accordingly, it has been required to provide a toner excellent in releasability, lubricity, and transferability.
      <br/>
      For this reason, toners containing a silicone compound have been disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (JP-B) 57-13868, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (JP-A) 54-48245, JP-A 59-197048, JP-A 2-3073, JP-A 3-63660, U.S. Pat. No. 4,517,272, etc.
      <br/>
      However, in such a toner containing a silicone compound directly added thereto, a silicone compound lacking mutual solubility with the binder resin shows a poor dispersibility and cannot be uniformly contained in individual toner particles, thus being liable to result in a fluctuation in chargeability of toner particles and a toner showing an inferior developing performance in a continuous use.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A corona discharger has been generally widely used in a printer or a copying machine utilizing electrophotography, as a means for uniformly charging the surface of a photosensitive member (electrostatic image-bearing member) or a means for transferring a toner image on a photosensitive member.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a contact charging or transferring method of causing a contact charging member to contact or be pressed against a photosensitive member surface while externally applying a voltage has been developed and commercialized.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Such a contact charging method or a contact transfer method has been proposed in, e.g., JP-A 63-149669 and JP-A 2-123385.
      <br/>
      In such a method, an electroconductive elastic roller is abutted against an electrostatic image-bearing member and is supplied with a voltage to uniformly charge the electrostatic image-bearing member, which is then subjected to an exposure and a developing step to have a toner image thereon.
      <br/>
      Further, another electroconductive elastic roller supplied with a voltage is pressed against the electrostatic image-bearing member and a transfer material is passed therebetween to transfer the toner image on the electrostatic image-bearing member onto the transfer material, followed by a fixing step to obtain a copied image.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Accordingly, a greater importance is attached to the releasability, lubricity and transferability of a toner, and a uniformity among the toner particles is required also for this purpose.
      <br/>
      In order to solve the problem, a toner obtained through polymerization has been proposed in JP-A 57-11354, JP-A 63-192055, etc., but the toner is liable to cause an excessive slippage and by-passing of toner particles at the cleaning section.
      <br/>
      A similar problem is liable to be caused in capsule toners containing a silicone compound which have been also proposed in a large number.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Compared with a conventionally widely used transfer means utilizing a corona discharge, a contact transfer means can enlarge the area of attachment of a transfer material onto a latent image-bearing member by controlling the force of pressing the transfer roller against the latent image-bearing member.
      <br/>
      Further, the transfer material is positively pressed and supported against the transfer position, it is possible to minimize a synchronization failure by the transfer material-conveying means and the transfer deviation due to looping or curling of the transfer material.
      <br/>
      Further, it also becomes easy to comply with the requirement of a shorter transfer material conveying path and a smaller diameter of latent image-bearing member accompanying the size reduction of image forming apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      On the other hand, in such an apparatus of performing a transfer by abutting, a certain pressure is necessarily applied to the transfer apparatus because a transfer current is supplied from the abutting position.
      <br/>
      When such an abutting pressure is applied, a pressure is also applied to the toner image on the latent image bearing member, thus being liable to cause agglomeration of the toner.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Further, in case where the latent image-bearing surface is composed of a resin, an attachment is liable to be caused between a toner agglomerate and the latent image-bearing member to hinder the transfer to the transfer material and, in an extreme case, a part of a toner image showing a strong attachment is liable to cause a transfer failure to result in a lack of toner image.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The above phenomenon is pronounced in development of line images of 0.1-2 mm. This is because edge development is predominant at line images to provide a large coverage with toner, which is thus liable to cause agglomeration under pressure and transfer failure resulting in a lack.
      <br/>
      A toner image formed in such instance provides a copied image having only a contour.
      <br/>
      This defective phenomenon is called "transfer dropout (resulting in a hollow image)".
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Such a transfer dropout noticeably occurs on a thick paper of 100 g/cm2 or large, an OHP film having a high degree of smoothness and on a second face during a both face copying.
      <br/>
      In the case of a thick paper and an OHP film, such a transfer dropout might be frequently caused because of a shortage of transfer electric field and a strong pressure because of a thick transfer material.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The transfer dropout might be frequently caused on a second face in the both face copying because the second face is also passed through a fixing device in the first face-copying so that the adhesion of a toner onto the second face is hindered.</p>
    <p num="14">For the above reasons, a transfer apparatus imposes serious requirements on a transfer material while it provides many advantages, such as size reduction and economization of electric power consumption.</p>
    <p num="15">
      On the other hand, a method of improving the dispersibility of a silicone compound by causing inorganic fine powder to adsorb the silicone compound and adding the inorganic fine powder into toner particles has been disclosed in JP-A 49-42354, JP-B 58-27503 and JP-A 2-3073.
      <br/>
      However, a toner and a developer having further improved releasability and transferability are desired.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Addition of particles treated with a silicone compound into toner particles has been disclosed in JP-A 59-200251, JP-A 58-80650, JP-A 61-279865, JP-A 1-100561, JP-A 1-105958, JP-A 2-126265, JP-A 2-287367, JP-A 3-43748, JP-A 4-274445, and JP-A 3-53260.
      <br/>
      In these references, the silicone compound is caused to adhere onto the particle surfaces for hydrophobization, increased dispersibility of particles and increased charge, so that the silicone compound does not move to the toner particle surfaces.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a toner and a developer having further improved releasability, lubricity and transferability are still desired.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Developers including toner particles to the surface of which silicone oil, etc., has been attached, have been disclosed in JP-B 44-32470, JP-B 48-24904 and JP-B 52-30855.
      <br/>
      These developers are accompanied with difficulties such that a small amount of silicone oil, etc., fails to uniformly attach to and cover the toner particles or is liable to be transferred from the toner particles to another member to be lost from the toner particle surfaces.
      <br/>
      As a result, the effect thereof cannot last for a long period or becomes ununiform, thus resulting in a charging irregularity and an adverse effect to the developing performance.
      <br/>
      Further, it is difficult to attach the silicone oil, etc. to form and retain a thin and uniform layer of the silicone oil on the toner particle surfaces, so that the effect thereof does not last for a long period but result in a poor developing performance.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Further, in the case of using a developer comprising a mixture of toner particles comprising a binder resin and a colorant, such as a magnetic material, and a flowability improver, such as silica, in an image forming apparatus including a contact charging means and a contact transfer means, there is liable to cause difficulties such that a slight amount of residual toner on the photosensitive member not removed in the cleaning step after the transfer step sticks to the charging roller and the transfer roller pressed against the photosensitive member, and the sticking and amount of such toner are enhanced or increased on an increased number of copying operations to result in a toner melt-sticking and cause charging failure, cleaning failure or transfer failure.
      <br/>
      As a result, the resultant images are liable to be accompanied with difficulties, such as a decrease and irregularity of image density, white spots in a solid black image, and black spots in a solid white image.
    </p>
    <p num="19">In order to remove a residual toner on a photosensitive member after a transfer step, various means, such as those according to the blade scheme, fur brush scheme and magnetic brush scheme, have been known, but it is difficult to completely remove the residual toner on the photosensitive member after the transfer step.</p>
    <p num="20">
      In order to obviate such a toner sticking onto a photosensitive member, it has been proposed to add both a friction-reducing substance and an abrasive substance to a toner in JP-A 48-47345.
      <br/>
      However, the friction-reducing substance is liable to form an adhering filmy substance so that the toner is liable to form a film of the friction-reducing substance on a charging roller and a transfer roller to cause charging failure and transfer failure, when used in an image forming apparatus equipped with contact charging means and contact transfer means.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In a medium-speed copying machine, an organic photosensitive member (organic photoconductor) is generally used for the purpose of size-reduction and cost-reduction.
      <br/>
      In order to reduce the friction of the surface layer of particularly an organic photosensitive member to prevent the deterioration of a charging characteristic, it has been proposed to use an organic photosensitive member containing in its surface layer a lubricant, such as a fluorine-containing resin fine powder, in JP-A 63-30850.
      <br/>
      Such an organic photosensitive member containing the lubricant is actually provided with a prolonged life, but is caused to have a lower surface smoothness of the photosensitive member because the lubricant shows a poor dispersibility in a binder resin, such as polycarbonate resin, constituting the surface layer.
      <br/>
      As a result, if the photosensitive member is incorporated in an image forming apparatus including a contact charging means and a contact transfer means, the toner after development is liable to enter the surface concavity, and the performance of cleaning the residual toner is liable to be lowered to result in a toner sticking on the charging roller, the transfer roller and the photosensitive member.
    </p>

    <p num="46">Examples of the liquid silicones may include: different functional group-modified silicone; non-reactive silicones, such as polyether-modified silicone, methylstyryl-modified silicone, alkyl-modified silicone, aliphatic acid-modified silicone, alkoxy-modified silicone, and fluorine-modified silicone; and straight silicones, such as dimethylsilicone, methylphenylsilicone, and methylhydrogen silicone.</p>
    <p num="47">
      In the present invention, the liquid lubricant on the surface of the colorant or magnetic powder is partially isolated to be present at the toner particle surface to exhibit its effect.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, curable silicone exhibits rather poor performance.
      <br/>
      Reactive silicone and silicone oil having a polar group can show an intense adsorption onto the colorant or magnetic powder as the carrier or a mutual solubility with the binder resin, so that they are liable to show an inferior effect depending on the degree of mutual solubility because of little isolation or liberation.
      <br/>
      A certain non-reactive silicone can show an inferior effect depending on the kind of a side chain providing a mutual solubility with the binder resin of the toner to decrease the migration to the toner particle surface.
    </p>
    <p num="48">For these reasons, dimethylsilicone, fluorine-modified silicone and fluorinated hydrocarbon may preferably be used because of little reactivity or polarity, weak adsorption onto carrier particles and little mutual solubility with the binder resin.</p>
    <p num="49">
      The liquid lubricant used in the present invention may preferably show a viscosity of 10-200,000 cSt, further preferably 20-50,000 cSt, particularly 50-20,000 cSt at 25 (degree)  C. Below 10 cSt, the liquid lubricant can plasticizes the toner in some cases because of much low molecular weight component, thus being liable to provide a poor anti-blocking property and worsening of developing performance with time.
      <br/>
      Above 100,000 cSt, the migration within toner particle can become ununiform, and the dispersion thereof on the colorant or magnetic powder becomes ununiform, so that individual toner particles can fail to have uniform releasability, lubricity or chargeability, thus resulting in inferior developing performance, transferability and anti-soiling characteristic during a continuous use.
    </p>
    <p num="50">The viscosity of the liquid lubricant may be measured, e.g., by Viscotester VT500 (mfd. by Haake Corp.).</p>
    <p num="51">
      One of several viscosity sensors for VT500 may be arbitrarily selected, and a measurement sample is placed in the measurement cell for the sensor to effect measurement.
      <br/>
      The viscosity (Pa.sec) displayed on the apparatus may be converted into cSt.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The toner particles according to the present invention may preferably be in a substantially indefinite shape.
      <br/>
      For example, if the toner particles are spherical or have a shape close thereto, the toner can show excessive lubricity and slippability, thereby causing a cleaning failure because of by-passing at the cleaner section.
      <br/>
      To the contrary, if the toner particles have an indefinite shape, they cause an appropriate degree of friction so that sufficient cleaning may be effected without impairing the releasability.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In the present invention, the liquid lubricant is carried on the colorant or magnetic powder to be dispersed in the toner particles.
      <br/>
      As the colorant or magnetic powder is uniformly dispersed in each toner particle, the liquid lubricant is accordingly uniformly dispersed in each toner particle.
    </p>
    <p num="54">For uniformly dispersing the liquid lubricant, such as silicone in toner particles, the dispersion becomes uniform if the liquid lubricant is carried on various carriers than by directly dispersing the liquid lubricant into toner particles.</p>
    <p num="55">
      In the present invention, not only the improvement in dispersibility of a liquid lubricant is intended.
      <br/>
      The liquid lubricant is further required to be liberated from the carrier particles to effectively exhibit its releasability and lubricating effect and also exhibit a certain degree of adsorption strength so as to prevent excessive liberation during the use of the toner and liberation during the production process.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      For this purpose, colorant or magnetic powder is used as the carrier particles.
      <br/>
      The colorant may be dye, pigment or carbon black.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The carrier particles constituting lubricating particles together with the liquid lubricant may comprise fine powder of an inorganic compound or an organic compound.
      <br/>
      Examples of the organic compound may include: organic resin, such as styrene resin, acrylic resin, silicone resin, silicone rubber, polyester resin, urethane resin, polyamide resin, polyethylene resin and fluorine resin, and aliphatic compounds.
      <br/>
      These fine particles may be formed into particles or agglomerated together with the liquid lubricant.
    </p>
    <p num="58">By retaining the liquid lubricant at the surface of the carrier particles and causing the liquid lubricant to be present on or in the vicinity of the toner particle surfaces, the amount of the liquid lubricant at the surface of toner particles may be appropriately controlled.</p>
    <p num="59">
      The liquid lubricant is liberated or isolated from the carrier particles to migrate toward the toner particle surface.
      <br/>
      In this instance, if the liquid lubricant is strongly adsorbed, the liquid lubricant is little liberated to cause little migration toward the toner particle surface, thus failing to show a sufficient releasability and lubricity of the toner particles.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the adsorption is too weak, the liquid lubricant excessively migrates to the toner particle surfaces, thus resulting in abnormal triboelectric chargeability to provide an excessive charge or insufficient charge causing a poor developing performance.
      <br/>
      Further, the toner particles are liable to show a poor flowability and result in an insufficient supply to the developing sleeve, leading to a density irregularity.
      <br/>
      If the liquid lubricant is liberated from the toner particle surfaces, the releasability and lubricity effect are lost.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      In the present invention, the adsorption strength of the liquid lubricant onto the carrier particles is moderate, so that the liberation of the liquid lubricant from the carrier particles occurs but does not occur excessively.
      <br/>
      While the liquid lubricant is liberated from the toner particle surface, it is gradually replenished from the carrier particles, so that the releasability and lubricity of the toner particles are retained.
      <br/>
      The carrier particles are present also at and in the vicinity of the toner particle surface, so that the liquid lubricant migrated to the toner particle surface can be re-adsorbed by the carrier particles and excessive exudation thereof can be prevented, thus not affecting an adverse effect to the developing performance.
      <br/>
      Further, even if the liquid lubricant is lost from the toner particle surface by liberation, the migration thereof from the interior of the toner particle is caused quickly, whereby the releasability and lubricity are uniformly retained.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Accordingly, it is important that the carrier particles are present also at or in the vicinity of the toner particle surface, in order to retain an appropriate amount of the liquid lubricant at the toner particle surface.
      <br/>
      An excessive amount of liquid lubricant is adsorbed thereby and an amount of the liquid lubricant lost by liberation is quickly replenished.
      <br/>
      For example, it is preferred that the liquid lubricant is adsorbed to such an extent that, when the carrier particles are removed from a toner particle, it is possible to recognize the presence of the liquid lubricant on the surface of the removed carrier particles, or on the surface of the carrier particles at the surface of the toner particle.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      As is understood from the above description, the toner according to present invention acquires its equilibrium and maximum releasability and lubricity with some time after its production.
      <br/>
      As a result, the effects are increased during a storage period after the production, but the effects are balanced with the adsorption by the carrier particles, so that the excessive presence of the liquid lubricant at the toner particle surface is prevented, and the storability and continuous image formation characteristic of the toner are not adversely affected.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      On the other hand, if the toner is provided with a thermal history of 30-45 (degree)  C., the equilibrium and maximum effects can be acquired in a shorter period to provide a developer showing a maximum performance stably.
      <br/>
      Even by such a thermal history application, an equilibrium state is attained without causing adverse effects.
      <br/>
      Such a thermal history can be imparted at any time after the formation of toner particles, and a pulverization toner may preferably be subjected to such a thermal history after the pulverization.

      <br/>
      It is preferable to use magnetic iron oxide particles containing a compound such as an oxide, a hydrated oxide or a hydroxide of a metal ion such as Si, Al or Mg, at the surface of or within the particles.

    <p num="67">
      Silicon-containing magnetic iron oxide particles adsorbs a liquid lubricant but not strongly, so that they can retain excessive liquid lubricant at the surface without fully liberating the liquid lubricant during the production.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the liquid lubricant is liberated moderately to be uniformly present at the surface of toner particles, thus showing effective releasability and lubricity for a long period without deterioration, and also excellent durability during continuous use.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      If the liquid lubricant is fully liberated from the magnetic powder during the toner production, the uniform distribution of the liquid lubricant to individual toner particles is failed.
      <br/>
      If the magnetic powder does not have an adsorption retentivity, the liquid lubricant is caused to be present in a large amount at the toner particle surfaces to exert adverse effects to the developing performance and triboelectric chargeability, thus resulting in difficulties, such as low image density, fog and lowering in image density due to excessive charge, and a lower developing performance during a continuous use.
    </p>
    <p num="69">Silicon-containing magnetic iron oxide particles have a uniform particle size distribution, so that the surface area of magnetic powder contained in each toner particle becomes constant and the liquid lubricant is contained in a constant amount in each toner particle.</p>

      The magnetic powder used in the present invention carries a liquid lubricant, so that it shows little mutual solubility with the binder resin but shows a releasability.

      As a result, the magnetic powder at the toner particle surface is liable to be liberated.
      <br/>
      However, polyhedral magnetic powder can physically prevent such liberation due to its shape.

    <p num="73">
      On the other hand, a spherical magnetic powder can cause liberation in some cases.

      In such a case, the magnetic powder liberated little by little can be attached to a developing sleeve to cause a lowering in triboelectric charge-imparting ability, leading to a lower developing performance.

    <p num="88">
      However, these methods involve difficulties in the case of magnetic powder such that it is difficult to have the magnetic powder uniformly carry a small amount of liquid lubricant or a shear force or heat is locally applied to cause a strong adsorption of the liquid lubricant.
      <br/>
      In the case of a silicone lubricant, the lubricant is liable to cause a burning so that the liberation thereof from the carrier particles cannot be effectively performed or the toner particles cannot be provided with a sufficient releasability or lubricity in some cases.
    </p>
    <p num="89">In the present invention, it is preferred to use a kneader or blender capable of applying a compression and a shear, such as a wheel-type kneader because the following three functions are performed:</p>
    <p num="90">
      (1) Due to the compression action, the liquid lubricant present between the colorant particles or the magnetic particles are pressed against the particles surfaces and extended through a spacing between the particles to increase the adhesion with the particle surfaces.
      <br/>
      (2) Due to the shearing action, the liquid lubricant is extended while disintegrating the particles.
      <br/>
      (3) Due to pressure-smoothing action, the liquid lubricant on the particle surface is uniformly extended.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      As a result of the repetition of the above three actions, the agglomerations of the colorant particles or magnetic powder particles are disintegrated, and the liquid lubricant is carried on the disintegrated individual particles.
      <br/>
      This type of kneader is particularly advantageous in the case of magnetic powder.
      <br/>
      In this instance, the liquid lubricant may be diluted with a solvent before being carried and dried thereafter.
    </p>
    <p num="92">A blade-type kneader such as a Henschel mixer, ordinarily used for surface treatment of magnetic powder has only a stirring function, so that it can exhibit only a small degree of effect, if any, intended by the present invention, the effect does not last sufficiently, or the treatment becomes ununiform to give an adverse effect to the developing performance.</p>
    <p num="93">Preferred examples of the wheel-type kneader may include: Shimpson Mix-maller, Multimal, Stock-mill, a reverse flow blender, and Irich-mill.</p>
    <p num="94">
      In the treatment for carrying the liquid lubricant, if the treatment intensity is excessively strong or long to cause a temperature increase, the liquid lubricant is liable to strongly stick to or react with the carrier particles, thus preventing the liberation of the liquid lubricant to fail in exhibiting the effect.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the treatment condition is also an important factor.
    </p>
    <p num="95">The colorant or magnetic powder is compressed during the above-carrying operation, it is preferred to disintegrate the treated particles by a hammer mill, a pin mill or a jet mill for the effective dispersion of the colorant or magnetic powder, particularly the magnetic powder, in the toner particles.</p>

      In the case of a colorant, a charge control agent can be simultaneously subjected to a carrying treatment.

      The solvent may be evaporated after the pulverization.
      <br/>
      In this instance, it is also possible to adopt a master batch method wherein the kneading is performed together with a small amount of resin.

      In the bulk polymerization, it is possible to obtain a low-molecular weight polymer by performing the polymerization at a high temperature so as to accelerate the termination reaction, but there is a difficulty that the reaction control is difficult.

      In the solution polymerization, it is possible to obtain a low-molecular weight polymer or copolymer under moderate conditions by utilizing a radical chain transfer function depending on a solvent used or by selecting the polymerization initiator or the reaction temperature.

      Of these, in the emulsion polymerization method, a monomer almost insoluble in water is dispersed as minute particles in an aqueous phase with the aid of an emulsifier and is polymerized by using a water-soluble polymerization initiator.
      <br/>
      According to this method, the control of the reaction temperature is easy, and the termination reaction velocity is small because the polymerization phase (an oil phase of the vinyl monomer possibly containing a polymer therein) constitute a separate phase from the aqueous phase.
      <br/>
      As a result, the polymerization velocity becomes large and a polymer having a high polymerization degree can be prepared easily.

      Further, the polymerization process is relatively simple, the polymerization product is obtained in fine particles, and additives such as a colorant, a charge control agent and others can be blended easily for toner production.

      The toner according to the present invention may be imparted with a further improved slippability by inclusion of a solid wax.
      <br/>
      The solid wax herein refers to a wax which has an absorption peaktop temperature of at least 50 (degree)  C. on a DSC (differential scanning calorimeter) curve and has a melting point of at least 25 (degree)  C. (room temperature).
    </p>
    <p num="176">
      The solid wax used in the present invention may preferably have a peak onset temperature of at least 50 (degree)  C. for an absorption peak on temperature increase on a DSC curve.
      <br/>
      Below 50 (degree)  C., a blocking is liable to occur during a thermal history-imparting step.
      <br/>
      The onset temperature may particularly preferably be in the range of 50-120 (degree)  C., further preferably 60-110 (degree)  C. It is further preferred that the peaktop temperature of a maximum absorption peak is at most 130 (degree)  C., particularly in the range of 70-130 (degree)  C., further preferably 85-120 (degree)  C. From a DSC curve on temperature increase, it is possible to evaluate the behavior of a wax when a heat is applied thereto, and absorption peaks accompanying transition and melting of the wax.
      <br/>
      If the peak onset temperature is in the range of 50-120 (degree)  C., it is possible to obtain particularly satisfactory developing performance, anti-blocking characteristic and low-temperature fixability.
      <br/>
      In case where the peak onset temperature is below 50 (degree)  C., the temperature of wax change is too low, and the toner is caused to have an inferior anti-blocking characteristic and inferior developing performance at high temperatures also because of the function of a liquid lubricant.
      <br/>
      Above 120 (degree)  C., the temperature of wax change becomes too high, so that an inferior fixability is liable to result.
      <br/>
      If the maximum absorption peak is at a temperature of at most 130 (degree)  C., preferably in the range of 70-130 (degree)  C., particularly preferably in the range of 85-120 (degree)  C., particularly good fixability and anti-offset characteristic are satisfied.
      <br/>
      If the maximum absorption peak is present at a peak temperature below 70 (degree)  C., a sufficient anti-high temperature-offset characteristic is not attained because of too low a melting point.
      <br/>
      If the peaktop temperature of the maximum peak is in a region exceeding 130 (degree)  C., sufficient anti-low-temperature offset characteristic and low-temperature fixability tend to be difficult to obtain because of too high a melting point of the wax.
      <br/>
      If the peak temperature of the maximum peak is present in the above-described range, it becomes easy to take a balance between the anti-offset characteristic and the fixability.
    </p>
    <p num="177">In order to further enhance the anti-high temperature offset characteristic, it is preferred that the absorption peak provides a terminal onset temperature (as determined from a DSC curve on temperature increase) of at least 60 (degree)  C., further preferably 80-140 (degree)  C., more preferably 90-130 (degree)  C., particularly preferably 100-130 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="178">It is further preferred that the terminal onset temperature and the onset temperature have a difference therebetween of 70-5 (degree)  C., more preferably 60-10 (degree)  C., further preferably 50-10 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="179">
      By satisfying the above condition, it becomes easy to take a balance of low-temperature fixability, anti-offset characteristic, anti-blocking characteristic and developing performance when the wax is used in combination with the liquid lubricant.
      <br/>
      If the above temperature difference is broader than the above range, an inferior anti-blocking characteristic results even if the low-temperature fixability and anti-offset characteristic are satisfied.
    </p>
    <p num="180">The liquid lubricant used in the present invention shows a release effect at the time of fixation but it is preferred to incorporate a solid wax described below in the toner particles in order to improve the releasability from the fixing member and the fixability at the time of fixation, particularly in the case of a heat-fixable toner.</p>
    <p num="181">
      Paraffin wax and derivatives thereof, montan wax and derivatives thereof, Fischer-Tropsch wax and derivatives thereof, polyolefin wax and derivatives thereof, and carnauba wax and derivatives thereof.

      The derivatives may include: oxides, block copolymers with a vinyl monomer, and graft-modification products.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is also possible to use alcohols, aliphatic acids, acid amides, esters, ketones, cured castor oil and derivatives thereof; vegetable waxes, animal waxes, mineral waxes and petrolactam.

      Among these solid waxes, preferred examples may include: a low-molecular weight polyolefin obtained through polymerization of an olefin by radical polymerization under a high pressure or in the presence of a Ziegler catalyst, and by-products in the polymerization; low-molecular weight polyolefins obtained by thermal decomposition of high-molecular weight polyolefin; a wax obtained from a distillation residue from synthetic hydrocarbons produced from a mixture gas containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, or a wax derived from synthetic hydrocarbons obtained by hydrogenation of the residues.
      <br/>
      The waxes can contain an anti-oxidant.
      <br/>
      Also preferred are linear alcohols, aliphatic acids, acid amides esters and montan derivatives.

      Particularly preferred examples of the solid wax may include; products obtained by polymerization of olefins, such as ethylene, in the presence of a Ziegler catalyst, and by-products thereof, and other hydrocarbon waxes such as Fischer-Tropsch wax, having up to several thousand carbon atoms, particularly up to 1000 carbons.
      <br/>
      It is also preferred to use a long-chain alkyl alcohol having up to several hundred carbon atoms, particularly up to 100 carbon atoms, and a terminal hydroxy group.
      <br/>
      It is also preferable to use an alkylene oxide adduct to an alcohol.
    </p>
    <p num="184">
      It is also preferred to use a solid wax prepared by fractionating the above solid waxes into a particular molecular weight fraction by the press sweating method, the solvent method, the vacuum distillation, the supercritical gas extraction method, and fractionating crystallization, such as melt-crystallization and crystal filtration.
      <br/>
      After the fractionation, it is possible to subject the product to oxidation, block copolymerization or graft-modification.
      <br/>
      By these methods, it is possible to remove a low-molecular weight fraction, extract a low-molecular weight fraction or removing a low-molecular weight fraction from the extract.
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      The toner according to the present invention may contain such a solid wax in a proportion of 0.2-20 wt. parts, more effectively 0.5-10 wt. parts, per 100 wt. parts of the binder resin.
      <br/>
      It is possible to use several species of wax in combination or a mixture of these.
      <br/>
      Waxes containing functional groups, such as alcohols, aliphatic acids, esters, acid amides and alcohol alkylene oxide adducts can contain polyolefins or hydrocarbons.
    </p>
    <p num="186">In the toner according to the present invention, the liquid lubricant and the solid wax are used in combination, so that it is possible to obtain not only an improved releasability in a molten state at the time of fixation but also improved lubricity and releasability in an ordinary state, thereby further enhancing the effect of the liquid lubricant.</p>
    <p num="187">
      It is also preferred to use a solid wax having a penetration of at most 4.0, and a density of at least 0.93, whereby the toner may be provided with an enhanced slippability and an increased cleanability, the melt-sticking is prevented, and the abrasion of the photosensitive member is minimized.
      <br/>
      The solid wax may preferably have a penetration of at most 3.0, particularly at most 2.0, and a density of 0.94.
    </p>
    <p num="188">
      If the density is above 0.93, the wax may be dispersed in a state capable of effectively providing the toner with a sufficient slippability.
      <br/>
      This is presumably because the wax is dispersed in an appropriate size at the toner particle surface.
      <br/>
      If the penetration is above 4.0 or the density is below 0.93, a sufficient effect cannot be obtained but the melt-sticking on the photosensitive member is liable to occur.
    </p>
    <p num="189">
      Another preferred wax may be one having a main component having at least 20 carbon atoms, further at least 30 carbon atoms, particularly at least 40 carbon atoms, in a carbon number distribution as measured by a gas chromatograph.
      <br/>
      It is particularly preferred to use a wax having continuous carbon number (number of methylene group) distribution giving peaks free from a periodical intensity difference in the present invention, because of a high hardness and a rich lubricity.
    </p>
    <p num="190">In view of the developing performance, fixability and anti-offset characteristics, it is preferred to use a wax having a maximum peak at a carbon number of at least 30, further preferably at least 40, particularly in the range of 50-150.</p>
    <p num="191">It is also preferred to use a polyolefin wax, a hydrocarbon wax or a long-chain alkyl alcohol wax having a weight-average molecular weight (Mw)/number-average molecular weight (Mn) ratio of at most 3.0, further at most 2.5, particularly at most 2.0, because of hardness and slippability.</p>
    <p num="192">
      A wax obtained through molecular weight-basis fractionation has also characteristics of slippability and hardness.
      <br/>
      If the wax is hard, the resultant toner is rich in slippability because of the presence of the wax at the toner particle surface when added to the toner particles.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the toner does not readily attach to the photosensitive member but can be easily cleaned while preventing the melt-sticking.
      <br/>
      Further, as the toner is rich in slippability, the abrasive function of the toner is reduced to prevent the scraping of the photosensitive member with the toner, thereby providing the toner particles with a more effective releasability and lubricity in combination with the releasability and lubricity of the liquid lubricant.
    </p>
    <p num="193">The wax may preferably have a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 300-1500, more preferably 350-1200, further preferably 400-1000, and a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 500-4500, more preferably 550-3600, further preferably 600-3000.</p>
    <p num="194">
      If Mn is below 300 or Mw is below 500, the wax can exhibit an excessive plasticizing function when used in combination with the liquid lubricant, thereby being liable to provide an inferior anti-blocking performance and a lower developing performance.
      <br/>
      If Mn is above 1500 or Mw is above 4500, it becomes difficult to obtain the fixability-improving function of the wax.

      The DSC measurement for characterizing the binder resin and the wax used in the present invention is used to evaluate heat transfer to and from these materials and observe the behavior, and therefore should be performed by using an internal heating input compensation-type differential scanning calorimeter which shows a high accuracy based on the measurement principle.

    <p num="235">
      Further, the liquid lubricant is repetitively liberated from and attached to the colorant or magnetic particle, and a part thereof migrates to the toner particle surface to form an equilibrium state, thereby providing the toner particles with releasability and lubricity.

      Particularly, by externally mixing the inorganic fine powder treated with nitrogen-containing silane compound and silicone oil, it becomes possible to improve the flowability and releasability of the developer, and also improve the stable image forming characteristic even in a low-humidity environment and a high-humidity environment.

      In case where the inorganic fine powder is treated with silicone oil, the treated inorganic fine powder exhibits hydrophobicity so that, when mixed with toner particles, it can retain a good chargeability even in a high-humidity environment.

      On the other hand, if the inorganic fine powder is treated with a nitrogen-containing silane compound, the treated inorganic powder is provided with a positive chargeability and also a certain degree of hydrophilicity.
      <br/>
      As a result, when it is mixed with toner particles to provide a developer, the developer can retain charge-leakage points to suppress the charge-up phenomenon (excessive charge of the developer), thereby retaining good chargeability even in a low-humidity environment.
    </p>
    <p num="273">In case where the inorganic fine powder is treated with a nitrogen-containing silane compound exhibiting a particularly excellent uniformity of treatment, the agglomeration of the powder can be suppressed so that, when it is blended with toner particle to provide a developer, the developer can obviate charging abnormality and coating failure on the developing sleeve.</p>

      Accordingly, the treated inorganic fine powder does not readily cause a charge-up phenomenon even in a low-humidity environment or a lower image density even in a high-humidity environment, thus retaining excellent developing performances.

    <p num="296">
      The treated inorganic fine powder, e.g., silica, may preferably show a hydrophobicity of 30-90%, as measured by the methanol titration test.

      More specifically, the hydrophobicity may be measured in the following manner.
      <br/>
      A sample (ca. 2 g) of treated inorganic fine powder is weighed into a beaker and 50 ml of pure water is added thereto.
      <br/>
      While the system is stirred by a magnetic stirrer, methanol is added to below the liquid surface.
      <br/>
      A terminal point is determined as a point of time when the sample disappears from the liquid surface.
      <br/>
      Based on the amount of methanol (X ml) used up to the terminal point, the hydrophobicity (%) is calculated as �X/(50+X)� * 100.

      Referring to FIG. 1, almost a right half of a developing sleeve 22 of a developing device 2 is always contacted with a toner stock T stirred by a stirring bar 27 in a toner vessel 21, and the toner in the vicinity of the developing sleeve surface is attached to the sleeve surface under a magnetic force exerted by a magnetic force generating means 23 in the sleeve 22 and/or an electrostatic force.
      <br/>
      As the developing sleeve 22 is rotated, the magnetic toner layer is formed into a thin magnetic toner layer T1 having an almost uniform thickness while moving through a doctor blade 24.
      <br/>
      The magnetic toner is charged principally by a frictional contact between the sleeve surface and the magnetic toner near the sleeve surface in the toner stock caused by the rotation of the developing sleeve 22.
      <br/>
      The magnetic toner thin layer on the developing sleeve is rotated to face a latent image-bearing member 1 in a developing region A at the closest gap a between the latent image-bearing member 1 and the developing sleeve.
      <br/>
      At the time of passing through the developing region A, the magnetic toner in a thin layer is caused to jump and reciprocally move through the gap A between the latent image-bearing member 1 and the developing sleeve 22 surface at the developing region A under an AC-superposed DC electric field applied between the latent image-bearing member 1 and the developing sleeve.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the magnetic toner on the developing sleeve 22 is selectively transferred and attached to form a toner image T2 on the latent image-bearing member depending on a latent image potential pattern on the member 1.
    </p>
    <p num="307">The developing sleeve surface having passed through the developing region A and selectively consumed the magnetic toner is returned by rotation to the toner stock in the vessel 21 to be replenished with the magnetic toner, followed by repetition of the magnetic thin toner layer T1 on the sleeve 22 connected to a DC supply So and an AC supply Si and development at the developing region A.</p>
    <p num="308">
      A doctor blade 24 (of a metal or a magnet) is used in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The development step in the image forming method according to the present invention can be also preferably be performed by a developing method using an elastic blade abutted against the sleeve surface.
    </p>
    <p num="309">
      The elastic blade may comprise, e.g., elastomers, such as silicone rubber, urethane rubber and NBR; elastic synthetic resins, such as polyethylene terephthalate; and elastic metals, such as steel and stainless steel.
      <br/>
      A composite material of these can also be used.
      <br/>
      It is preferred to use an elastomeric blade.
    </p>
    <p num="310">
      The material of the elastic blade may largely affect the chargeability of the toner on the toner-carrying member (sleeve).
      <br/>
      For this reason, it is possible to add an organic or inorganic substance to the elastic material as by melt-mixing or dispersion.
      <br/>
      Examples of such additive may include metal oxide, metal powder, ceramics, carbon, whisker, inorganic fiber, dye, pigment and surfactant.
      <br/>
      In order to control the charge-imparting ability, it is also possible to line the part of an elastic blade of a rubber, synthetic resin or metal abutted to the sleeve with a resin, rubber, metal oxide or metal.
      <br/>
      If the durability is required of the elastic blade and the sleeve, it is preferred to line the part abutted to the sleeve of a metal elastic blade with a resin or rubber.
    </p>
    <p num="311">
      In the case of a negatively chargeable magnetic toner, it is preferred to compose a blade with urethane rubber, urethane resin, polyamide, nylon or a material readily chargeable to a positive polarity.
      <br/>
      In the case of a positively chargeable toner, it is preferred to compose a blade with urethane rubber, urethane resin, fluorine-containing resin (such as teflon resin), polyimide resin, or a material readily chargeable to a negative polarity.
      <br/>
      When the portion abutted to the sleeve of the blade is formed as a molded product of a resin or rubber, it is preferable to incorporate an additive, inclusive of metal oxides, such as silica, alumina, titania tin oxide, zirconium oxide and zinc oxide; carbon black and a charge control agent generally used in a toner.
    </p>
    <p num="312">
      An upper side of the elastic blade is fixed to the developer vessel and the lower side is pressed with a bending in resistance to the elasticity of the blade against the developing sleeve so as to extend in a direction forward or reverse with respect to the rotation direction of the sleeve and exert an appropriate elastic pressure against the sleeve surface with its inner side (or outer side in case of the reverse abutment).
      <br/>
      The relevant parts of image forming apparatus including a developing apparatus using an elastic blade are for example shown in FIGS. 2-5. In FIGS. 2-5, reference numerals 201, 301, 401 and 501 denote an image-bearing member; 202, 303, 402 and 502 denote a developing sleeve; 203, 302, 403 and 503 denote a blade; and V denotes a bias voltage application means.
      <br/>
      By using such apparatus, it is possible to form a thin but dense layer in a more stable manner regardless of changes in environmental conditions.
      <br/>
      This is presumably because the toner particles are forcibly rubbed between the elastic blade and the sleeve surface unlike a metal blade disposed with a certain gap from the sleeve, so that the toner is charged under an identical condition without being affected by a change in toner behavior depending on an environmental change.
    </p>
    <p num="313">
      The toner and the developer according to the present invention is rich in slippability, so that the wearing of the elastic blade and the sleeve can be minimized and a uniform triboelectric change can be retained for a long period.
      <br/>
      As the developer according to the present invention is rich in slippability, it is possible that the charging becomes ununiform because of insufficient friction in a low-speed image forming apparatus including a metal blade disposed with a gap from the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p num="314">
      The abutting pressure between the blade and the sleeve may be at least 1 g/cm, preferably 3-250 g/cm, further preferably 5-120 g/cm, in terms of a linear pressure along the generatrix of the sleeve.
      <br/>
      Below 1 g/cm, the uniform application of the toner becomes difficult, thus resulting in a broad charge distribution of the toner causing fog or scattering.
      <br/>
      Above 250 g/cm, an excessively large pressure can be applied to the developer to cause deterioration and agglomeration of the developer, and a large torque is required for driving the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p num="315">The spacing  DELTA  between the latent image-bearing member and the developing sleeve may be set to e.g., 50-500  MU m. In case of using a magnetic blade as a doctor blade, the magnetic blade may preferably be disposed with a spacing of 50-400  MU m from the sleeve surface.</p>
    <p num="316">
      The thickness of the toner layer on the sleeve is most suitably smaller than the gap  DELTA .
      <br/>
      It is however possible to set the toner layer thickness such that a portion of many ears of magnetic toner can touch the latent image bearing member.
    </p>
    <p num="317">

      Next, a non-magnetic monocomponent developing method using the toner or developer according to the present invention will be described for example.
      <br/>
      This should not be construed as restrictive.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows a developing apparatus for developing an electrostatic image formed on a latent image-bearing member 601.
      <br/>
      The electrostatic image may be formed by an electrophotographic means or electrostatic recording means (not shown).
      <br/>
      The developing apparatus includes a developing sleeve 602 which is a non-magnetic sleeve composed of aluminum or stainless steel.
    </p>
    <p num="328">
      The developing sleeve can comprise a crude pipe of aluminum or stainless steel as it is.
      <br/>
      However, the surface thereof may preferably be uniformly roughened by blasting with glass beads, etc., mirror-finished or coated with a resin.
      <br/>
      The developing sleeve is similar to the one used in the magnetic monocomponent developing method.
    </p>
    <p num="329">
      Developer 606 is stored in a hopper 603 and supplied to the developing sleeve 602 by a supply roller 604.
      <br/>
      The supply roller 604 comprises a foam material, such as polyurethane foam and is rotated at a non-zero relative speed with the developing sleeve 602 in a direction identical or reverse to that of the developing sleeve.
      <br/>
      In addition to the toner supply, the supply roller 604 functions to peel off the developer remaining on the developing sleeve 602 without being used after the development.
      <br/>
      The developer supplied to the developing sleeve 602 is uniformly applied by a developer-applicator blade 605 to form a thin layer on the sleeve 602.
    </p>
    <p num="330">
      The abutting pressure between the developer applicator blade and the sleeve may suitably be 3-250 g/cm, preferably 5-120 g/cm, in terms of a linear pressure along the generatrix of the sleeve.
      <br/>
      Below 3 g/cm, the uniform application of the toner becomes difficult, thus resulting in a broad charge distribution of the toner causing fog or scattering.
      <br/>
      Above 250 g/cm, an excessively large pressure can be applied to the developer to cause deterioration and agglomeration of the developer, and a large torque is required for driving the sleeve.
      <br/>
      By controlling the abutting pressure within a range of 3-250 g/cm, the developer according to the present invention can effectively be disintegrated from agglomeration, and the toner can be quickly charged.
    </p>
    <p num="331">
      The developer applicator blade may preferably be composed of a material having a triboelectric chargeability suitable for charging the toner to a desired polarity and may be constituted similarly as the one used in the magnetic monocomponent developing method.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the blade may suitably be composed of silicone rubber, urethane rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, etc., and can be coated with polyamide or nylon.
      <br/>
      Further, an electroconductive rubber can suitably be used to prevent an excessive charge of the toner.
    </p>
    <p num="332">
      In the toner application system using an applicator blade to form a thin layer of toner on a developing sleeve, it is preferred that the toner layer thickness is set to be smaller than a gap between the developing sleeve 602 and the latent image-bearing member 601, and an alternating electric field is applied across the gap, in order to obtain a sufficient image density.
      <br/>
      A developing bias voltage of an alternating electric field optionally superposed with a DC electric field may be applied across the gap between the developing sleeve 602 and the latent image-bearing member 601 from a bias voltage supply 607 shown in FIG. 6 so as to promote the movement of the toner from the developing sleeve to the latent image-bearing member, thereby providing a better quality image.

      These conditions may be similar to those in the magnetic monocomponent developing method.

      The magnetic particles 727 may for example be composed by coating with a resin ferrite particles having a resistivity of at least 107 ohm.cm, preferably at least 108 ohm.cm., and a maximum magnetization of 55-75 emu/g.
      <br/>
      A toner 737 is stored in a hopper within the developer vessel 736.
      <br/>
      A sealing member 740 is disposed to seal the toner at a lower part of the vessel 736 and bent along the direction of rotation of the sleeve 722, so as to elastically press the sleeve 722 surface.
      <br/>
      The sealing member 740 has an end at a downstream side of the sleeve rotation direction in the contact region with the sleeve so as to allow the developer to enter into the developer vessel.

      A toner supply roller 760 is disposed to operate depending on an output from a toner density detector sensor (not shown).

      The replenishment of the non-magnetic toner 737 is controlled by rotation and stopping of the roller 760.

      A fresh developer replenished with the toner 737 is conveyed by a screw 761 while being stirred and mixed.

      As a result, during the conveyance, the replenished toner is triboelectrically charged.
      <br/>
      A partition plate 763 has lacks at both longitudinal ends of the developer vessel, where the fresh developer conveyed by the screw 761 is transferred to a screw 762.
      <br/>
      An S-magnetic pole 723d is a conveying pole and functions to recover the developer after the development and convey the developer within the vessel to the limiting section.

      If the distance is smaller than 100  MU m, the magnetic particles are plugged thereat to result in an irregularity of developer layer and the developer cannot be applied so as to effect good development, thus resulting in only thin developed images.

      The gap may preferably be 400  MU m or larger in order to prevent ununiform application (so-called blade plugging) with unusable particles present as contamination in the developer.

      During the rotation of the sleeve 722 in the arrow b direction, the movement of the magnetic layer is retarded, as it leaves away from the sleeve surface, due to a balance between a constraint by the magnetic force and gravity and the conveying force in the moving direction of the sleeve 722.

      Some part of magnetic particles can drop due to gravity.

    <p num="368">
      The fluorine-containing graft polymer may preferably be added in a proportion of 0.1-30 wt. %, particularly 1-20 wt. %, of the fluorine-containing resin powder.
      <br/>
      If the amount is below 0.1 wt. %, the dispersion stabilization effect for the fluorine-containing resin powder is insufficient and, above 30 wt. %, the fluorine-containing graft polymer is present not only in a state of being adsorbed with the fluorine-containing resin powder but also in an isolated state in the surface layer resin, thus resulting in an accumulation of residual potential on repetition of the electrophotographic cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="369">In order to provide the photosensitive member with a long life, the photosensitive member may preferably have an outermost protective layer and can exhibit a further prolonged life when used in combination with the developer according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="370">
      The protective layer may preferably comprises one or more species of resins, such as polyester, polycarbonate, acrylic resin, epoxy resin, phenolic resin and phosphazene resin optionally together with their hardener, so as to provide a prescribed hardness.
      <br/>
      The protective layer may preferably have a thickness of 0.1-6  MU m, more preferably 0.5-4  MU m in order to obviate an increased residual potential or a lowered sensitivity during continuous image formation because the protective layer is disposed on the photosensitive layer as a layer through which charge does not readily migrate.
    </p>
    <p num="371">The protective layer may be formed by application such as spray coating or beam coating, or by penetration coating by selection of an appropriate solvent.</p>
    <p num="372">In order to adjust the electrical resistivity of the protective layer, it is possible to add a charge transport substance as described above or metal oxide particles.</p>
    <p num="373">
      Examples of the metal oxide particles may include: ultra fine particles of zinc oxide, titanium oxide, tin oxide, antimony oxide, indium oxide, bismuth oxide, tin oxide-coated titanium oxide, tin-coated indium oxide, antimony-coated tin oxide, and zirconium oxide.
      <br/>
      These metal oxides may be used singly or in mixture of two or more species.
      <br/>
      The two or more species can assume a form of solid solution or a mutually melt-stuck form.

    <p num="374">The developer according to the present invention is particularly effective for an organic photosensitive member which is a latent image-bearing member comprising a sur face layer of an organic compound, such as a resin.</p>
    <p num="375">
      A surface layer comprising an organic compound is liable to cause an adhesion with the binder resin in the toner.
      <br/>
      And, if similar materials are used, a chemical bond is liable to occur at a contact point between the toner and the photosensitive member surface, thus being liable to lower the releasability.
      <br/>
      As a result, there is liable to cause inferior transferability or cleanability, melt-sticking and filming.
    </p>
    <p num="376">
      The surface of the latent image bearing member may be composed of, e.g., silicone resin, vinylidene chloride resin, ethylene-vinylidene chloride resin, styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, styrene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, styrene resin, polyethylene terephthalate resin, and polycarbonate resin.
      <br/>
      These are not exhaustive however, but it is also possible to use copolymers of these resins with another monomer or other blends.
      <br/>
      Particularly, polycarbonate resin is effective for an image forming apparatus including a photosensitive member in the form of a photosensitive drum having a diameter of at most 50 mm, particularly at most 40 mm, e.g., 25-35 mm. If the surface layer contains a lubricating substance or is provided with a protective layer, a further increased effect can be attained.
    </p>
    <p num="377">
      This is because, in the case of a photosensitive drum having a small diameter, an identical linear pressure can cause a larger pressure concentration at an abutting portion because of a small curvature radius.
      <br/>
      A similar phenomenon is expected in the case of a belt form photosensitive member, and the developer according to the present invention is also effective for an image forming apparatus equipped with a belt-form photosensitive member providing a curvature radius of at most 25 mm at the transfer section.
    </p>
    <p num="378">
      The cleaning may preferably be performed by a blade-cleaning scheme, wherein a blade of urethane rubber, silicone rubber or an elastic resin or a blade of a metal, etc., having a resin tip, is abutted against a photosensitive member in a direction normal or reverse with respect to the photosensitive member moving direction.
      <br/>
      The blade may preferably be abutted in a direction reverse with respect to the photosensitive member moving direction.
      <br/>
      The blade may preferably be abutted against the photosensitive member at a linear pressure of at least 5 g/cm, more preferably 10-50 g/cm.
      <br/>
      The blade cleaning can be combined with the magnetic brush cleaning method, the fur brush cleaning method, or the roller cleaning method.
    </p>
    <p num="379">
      The toner according to the present invention is excellent in releasability and lubricity in addition to an appropriate degree of friction, so that the toner can be cleaned well by the blade cleaning while preventing the damage or abrasion of the photosensitive member even by abutting the blade.

      On the other hand, the toner is not liable to cause melt-sticking or filming.

    <p num="380">
      In the image forming method using the toner according to the present invention, the charging step and transfer step can be performed either by using a corona charger which does not contact the photosensitive member or by using a contact charger, such as a roller charger.

      In view of effective uniform charging, simplicity and low ozone-generating characteristic, a contact-type may preferably be used.

    <p num="383">
      The system includes an electrostatic image-bearing member 801 in the form of a rotatable drum (photosensitive member).
      <br/>
      The photosensitive member 801 basically comprises an electroconductive substrate 801b and a photoconductor layer 801a on its outer surface, and rotates in a clockwise direction in an as-shown state at a prescribed speed (process speed).

      <br/>
      A charging bias voltage supply 803 is disposed to apply a voltage V2 to the charging roller 802.
      <br/>
      Thus, the charging roller 802 is supplied with the bias voltage to charge the surface of the photosensitive member to a prescribed potential of a prescribed polarity.
      <br/>
      Then, an electrostatic image is formed on the photosensitive member 801 by exposure to image light 804 and visualized as a toner image by a developing means 805.

      A developing sleeve constituting the developing means 805 is supplied with a bias voltage V1 by a bias voltage supply 813.

      <br/>
      The contact transfer means 806 is supplied with a transfer bias voltage V3 from a supply 807.
    </p>
    <p num="386">
      In the image forming apparatus using contact charging and contact transfer schemes, the uniform charging of a photosensitive member and sufficient toner image transfer can be effected at a relatively low bias voltage, compared with the corona charging and corona transfer scheme.

      This is advantageous in size-reduction of a charger per se and also preventing the formation of corona discharge products, such as ozone.

      The transfer material 808 is conveyed between the photosensitive member 801 and the transfer roller 806 while a bias voltage polarity opposite to that of the toner is applied to the transfer roller 806 from a transfer bias voltage supply 807, whereby the toner image on the photosensitive member 801 is transferred onto the front side of the transfer material 808.

      FIG. 9 is an enlarged side view of a transfer roller in combination with a latent image-bearing member (photosensitive member) in an image forming apparatus.

      Referring to FIG. 9, the image forming apparatus includes a cylindrical photosensitive member 901 extending in a direction perpendicular to the drawing and rotating in an arrow A direction, and an electroconductive transfer roller 902 abutted to the photosensitive member 901.

    <p num="400">The charger (transfer roller or belt) may preferably be abutted against the photosensitive member 901 (or 1001) at a linear pressure of at least 1 g/cm, preferably 1-300 g/cm, particularly preferably 3-100 g/cm.</p>
    <p num="401">The linear pressure (g/cm) may be given by dividing the total force (g) applied to the transfer member (roller or belt) by the abutted length (cm).</p>
    <p num="402">
      If the abutting pressure is below 1 g/cm, a transfer failure is liable to occur due to a conveyance deviation of the transfer material and an insufficient transfer current.
      <br/>
      The toner according to the present invention is particularly effective in providing a good transferability and preventing transfer failure in a system wherein the transfer roller and the photosensitive member rotate at an identical speed.
    </p>
    <p num="403">
      In case of using a charging roller or a charging blade, the toner according to the present invention rich in releasability and lubricity, is not liable to soil these members or result in abnormal images due to charging irregularity.
      <br/>
      Even if the toner is attached, it is readily liberated, so that the damage or excessive abrasion of the photosensitive member can be avoided.
    </p>
    <p num="404">
      The toner is also excellent in releasability from the photosensitive member, so that it provides a good transferability and an increased transfer efficiency while preventing transfer dropout.
      <br/>
      It exhibits particularly remarkable effects in a contact transfer system using a transfer roller, a transfer belt, a transfer drum, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="405">As the transferability is excellent, good transfer is accomplished even at a small transfer current or a small transfer pressure, so that the photosensitive member is less damaged and provided with a longer life.</p>
    <p num="406">
      A part of the liquid lubricant can be transferred from the toner to the photosensitive member and the charging member to increase the releasability of the photosensitive member per se, thereby further increasing the transferability and cleanability.
      <br/>
      The releasability of the charging member is also increased, and the charging member is less liable to be soiled.
    </p>
    <p num="407">
      In the present invention, toner particles are made less attachable directly to the contact charging member surface, the contact transfer member surface and the photosensitive member surface, and also the releasability of the toner particles with respect to those surfaces is improved to prevent the sticking of the toner per se.
      <br/>
      Further, even if the toner particles are attached to the contact charging member surface, the contact transfer member surface and the photosensitive member surface, the toner particles are always moved on or among these members because of the lubricity and releasability of the toner particles and do not remain at the same position, so that toner particles are prevented from sticking.
      <br/>
      Further, when a cleaning member is abutted to the contact charging member and the contact transfer member, the toner particles attached to these members can be easily removed with an increased cleanability because of the releasability.
    </p>
    <p num="408">Further, the liquid lubricant is slightly transferred also to the cleaning member, thereby increasing the cleaning performance of the cleaning member.</p>
    <p num="409">The toner or developer according to the present invention is fixed under heating onto a transfer material such as plain paper or a transparent sheet for an overhead projector (OHP) by a contact heating means in the case of heat fixation.</p>
    <p num="410">The contact heating means may for example be a hot-pressure roller fixation apparatus or a hot fixation device including a fixed heating member and a pressing member disposed opposite to the heating member so as to be pressed toward the heating member and cause a transfer material to contact the heating member via a film.</p>
    <p num="411">An embodiment of the fixing device is illustrated in FIG. 11.</p>
    <p num="412">Referring to FIG. 11, the fixing device includes a heating member which has a heat capacity smaller than that of a conventional hot roller and has a linear heating part exhibiting a maximum temperature of preferably 100-300 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="413">The film disposed between the heating member and the pressing member may preferably comprise a heat-resistant sheet having a thickness of 1-100  MU m. The heat-resistant sheet may comprise a sheet of a heat-resistant polymer, such as polyester, PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PFA (tetrafluoro-ethylene-perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymer), PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), polyimide, or polyamide; a sheet of a metal such as aluminum, or a laminate of a metal sheet and a polymer sheet.</p>
    <p num="414">The film may preferably have a release layer and/or a low resistivity layer on such a heat-resistant sheet.</p>
    <p num="415">An embodiment of the fixing device will be described with reference to FIG. 11.</p>
    <p num="416">
      The device includes a low-heat capacity linear heating member 1101, which may for example comprise an aluminum substrate 1110 of 1.0 mm-t * 10 mm-W * 250 mm-L, and a resistance material 1109 which has been applied in a width of 1.0 mm on the aluminum substrate and is energized from both longitudinal ends.
      <br/>
      The energization is performed by applying pulses of DC 100 V and a cycle period of 20 msec while changing the pulse widths so as to control the evolved heat energy and provide a desired temperature depending on the output of a temperature sensor 1111.
      <br/>
      The pulse width may range from ca. 0.5 msec to 5 msec.
      <br/>
      In contact with the heating member 1101 thus controlled with respect to the energy and temperature, a fixing film 1102 is moved in the direction of an indicated arrow.
    </p>
    <p num="417">
      The fixing film 1102 may for example comprise an endless film including a 20  MU m-thick heat-resistant film (of, e.g., polyimide, polyether imide, PES or PFA, provided with a coating of a fluorine-containing-resin such as PTFE or PAF on its image contact side) and a 10  MU m-thick coating release layer containing an electroconductive material therein.
      <br/>
      The total thickness may generally be less than 100  MU m, preferably less than 40  MU m. The film is driven in the arrow direction under tension between a drive roller 1103 and a mating roller 1104.
    </p>
    <p num="418">
      The fixing device further includes a pressure roller 1105 having a releasable elastomer layer of, e.g., silicone rubber and pressed against the heating member 1101 via the film at a total pressure of 4-20 kg, while moving together with the film in contact therewith.
      <br/>
      A transfer material 1106 carrying an unfixed toner image 1107 is guided along an inlet guide 1108 to the fixing station to obtain a fixed image by the heating described above.
    </p>
    <p num="419">The above-described embodiment includes a fixing film in the form of an endless belt but the film can also be an elongated sheet driven between a sheet supply axis and a sheet winding axis.</p>
    <p num="420">
      In the above described fixing system, the heating member has a rigid flat surface so that the transfer material at the fixing nip is pressed in a flat state by the pressure roller to fix the toner image thereon.
      <br/>
      Further, because of the structure, the gap between the fixing film and the transfer material is narrowed immediately before the transfer material enters the nip, so that air between the fixing film and the transfer material is pushed out toward the rear direction.
    </p>
    <p num="421">
      Under such state, if a transfer material line enters in the longitudinal direction of the heating member, air is pushed out toward the line.
      <br/>
      In this instance, if the toner image is put lightly on the line, the pushed air goes out toward the rear side while scattering the developer particles therewith.
    </p>
    <p num="422">
      Particularly, when the transfer paper is not so smooth or is wet, the transfer electric field is weakened and the toner image is only weakly pulled toward the transfer paper.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the above-mentioned scattering of the toner image is liable to occur.
      <br/>
      Further, in case of a large process speed, the scattering becomes noticeable because of an increased air pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="423">As the developer according to the present invention has the liquid lubricant at the toner particle surfaces, the developer is liable to be induced and is strongly pulled toward the transfer material, so that the tight developer image is formed by static agglomeration and the above-mentioned scattering can be alleviated.</p>
    <p num="424">
      The toner or the developer according to the present invention is provided with a rather higher charge through triboelectrification, so that the developer on the latent image bearing member is also provided with a high charge and the developer image is more strongly transferred toward the transfer material under a transfer electric field.
      <br/>
      This is also advantageous in alleviating the scattering.

After cooling, the kneaded product was finely pulverized by a jet pulverizer and classified by a pneumatic classifier to obtain Toner-1 (invention) having a weight-average particle size of 8  MU m. Toner-1 was then left standing in an environment of 40 (degree)  C. for 1 day. To 100 wt. parts of Toner-1, 0.8 wt. part of Inorganic fine powder-1 was externally added and blended in a Henschel mixer to obtain Developer-1 (invention).</p>
    <p num="449">As a result of GPC measurement, Developer-1 showed peaks at 13,200 and 580,000 and contained 75% of component in a molecular weight region of at most 100,000.</p>
    <p num="450">
      As a result of the fluorescent X-ray analysis, Toner-1 showed a silicon content (excluding the amount derived from the magnetic material) of 0.15 wt. %, which was almost identical to the theoretical value (0.16 wt. %).
      <br/>
      The silicon content ratio with that in the classified fine powder portion was 1.0032, thus showing a very good dispersion state.
      <br/>
      Toner-1 (and therefore Developer-1) contained silicone oil as the liquid lubricant, whereby it was confirmed that the liquid lubricant was uniformly contained in the toner particles.
    </p>
    <p num="451">
      Further, as a result of ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis), Toner-1 showed a silicon atom concentration (originated from silicone) and a carbon atom concentration, giving a ratio therebetween at the toner particle surface of 0.017 compared with a theoretical value of 0.0014 based on the assumption of uniform distribution of silicon.
      <br/>
      This means that silicon was present preferentially at the surface, i.e., the silicone oil as the liquid lubricant was preferentially present at the toner particle surface.

      From the above, it is recognized that the direct mixing of the liquid lubricant with the other starting ingredients caused an ununiform dispersion.

    <p num="488">A commercially available electrophotographic copying machine ("NR6030", mfd. by Canon K.K., equipped with contact charging means, contact transfer means, a urethane rubber blade cleaner, and an organic photosensitive member having a surface layer comprising polycarbonate resin (with 8 wt. % of teflon powder dispersed therein) was remodeled so that the contact transfer roller rotated at an identical speed as the photosensitive drum and the doctor blade in the developing apparatus was replaced by a stainless steel blade having a silicone rubber tip applied thereto, thereby providing a testing machine.</p>
    <p num="489">The testing machine had a structure schematically as shown in FIG. 12.</p>
    <p num="490">Referring to FIG. 12, a charging roller 1202 basically comprises a central core metal 1202b and an electroconductive elastic layer 1202a comprising an epichlorohydrin rubber with carbon black dispersed therein and surrounding the core metal 1202b.</p>
    <p num="491">
      The charging roller 1202 is pressed against a photosensitive member 1201 surface at a linear pressure of 40 g/cm and is rotated following the rotation of the photosensitive member 1201.

    <p num="499">Fixation Scattering</p>
    <p num="500">A developer image was transferred onto a rougher side of a transfer paper of 80 g/m2 of which the moisture was adjusted by standing in a humidity of 80% RH and subjected to a fixation test by using an external fixing apparatus as illustrated in FIG. 11, wherein an unfixed image on a transfer material 1106 was pressed against a heating member 1101 via a film 1102 by a pressing member 1105 disposed opposite to the heating member 1101.</p>

      The pressure roller 1105 of silicone rubber was used to apply a total pressure of 10 kg between the heating member 1101 and the pressure roller 1105 with a nip of 4.0 mm and at a process speed of 90 mm/sec.
      <br/>
      The film was driven under tension between a drive roller 1103 and a follower roller 1104.
      <br/>
      The linear heating member 1101 of a low heat capacity was supplied with pulsed energy to be temperature-controlled at 190 (degree)  C.

      100 parts of a carrier powder (shown in Table 15) was stirred in a Henschel mixer and a prescribed amount of a liquid lubricant (shown in Table 15) diluted with n-hexane was added dropwise thereto.
      <br/>
      After the addition, the system was stirred at a high speed, followed by removal of n-hexane under vacuum.
      <br/>
      The product was disintegrated as desired by a hammer mill.
      <br/>
      The composition and the properties of several lubricating particles (1-10) thus formed are summarized in the following Table 15.

After cooling, the kneaded product was finely pulverized by a jet pulverizer and classified by a pneumatic classifier to obtain Toner-18 (invention) having a weight-average particle size of 8  MU m. Toner-18 was then left standing in an environment of 40 (degree)  C. for 1 day. To 100 wt. parts of Toner-18, 0.8 wt. part of Inorganic fine powder-1 was externally added and blended in a Henschel mixer to obtain Developer-23 (invention).</p>
    <p num="638">As a result of GPC measurement, Developer-23 showed peaks at 13,200 and 580,000 and contained 75% of component in a molecular weight region of at most 100,000.</p>
    <p num="639">
      Further, as a result of ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis), Toner-18 showed a silicon atom concentration (originated from silicone) and a carbon atom concentration, giving a ratio therebetween at the toner particle surface of 0.023 (incidentally, the silicon content in the magnetic material was very slight as observed in Toner-30 (comparative) and could be negligible).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a theoretical value was 0.0014 based on the assumption of uniform distribution of silicon.
      <br/>
      This means that silicon was present preferentially at the surface, i.e., the silicone oil as the liquid lubricant was preferentially present at the toner particle surface.
    </p>
    <p num="640">Incidentally, Toner-31 (comparative), when subjected to the same analysis, gave a ratio of 0.039, indicating further localization of silicone at the toner particle surface.</p>
