    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to an ethylene polymerization catalyst utilized in the polymerization of ethylene wherein an ethylene copolymer resin is produced which has unique melt elastic properties when the resin is in its reactor-made or pelletized forms.
      <br/>
      The melt elastic properties observed by the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention are not found in ethylene copolymers known heretofore, and importantly provide enhanced-impact strength properties to films that are produced therefrom.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The successful development of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) has forever changed the character of the polyethylene industry.
      <br/>
      For over fifty years, low density polyethylene (LDPE) was produced at pressures ranging up to 345 MPa (50,000 psi) and temperatures of about 300 (degree)  C. Technology was then developed in subsequent years which was capable of operating at less than 2 MPa (300 psi) and near about 100 (degree)  C. This technologic development has rapidly established itself as a low cost route to producing LLDPE.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      LLDPE, which is typically made using a transition metal catalyst rather than a free-radical catalyst, as required for LDPE, is characterized by linear molecules having no long-chain branching; short-chain branching is instead present and is the primary determinant of resin density.
      <br/>
      The density of commercially available LLDPE typically ranges from 0.915-0.940 g/cm3. Moreover, commercially available LLDPEs generally exhibit a crystallinity of from about 25-60 vol. %, and a melt index which can range from 0.01 g/10 min. to several hundred g/10 min.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Many commercial LLDPEs are available which contain one or more comonomers such as propylene, 1-butene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      The specific selection of a comonomer for LLDPE is based primarily on process compatibility, cost and product design.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In today's polyethylene industry, LLDPEs are used in a wide variety of applications including film forming, injection molding, rotomolding, and wire and cable fabrication.
      <br/>
      A principal area for LLDPE copolymers is in film forming applications since such copolymers typically exhibit high dart impact, high Elmendorf tear, high tensile strength and high elongation, in both the machine direction (MD) and the transverse direction (TD), compared with counterpart LDPE resins.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Examples of previous developmental trends in this field include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,260,245; 5,336,652; and 5,561,091, all to Mink et al., which disclose LLDPE films that exhibit the above properties made from polymerizing ethylene and at least one comonomer in the presence of a polymerization cocatalyst and vastly distinct transition metal catalysts.
      <br/>
      Specifically, in the '245 patent the transition metal catalyst is formed by treating silica having reactive OH groups with a dialkylmagnesium compound in a solvent; adding to said solvent a carbonyl-containing compound and then treating with a transition metal compound.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In the '652 patent, the transition metal catalyst is prepared by treating a support having a reduced surface OH content with an organomagnesium compound; treating the product with a silane compound having the formula Rx1 SiRy2 wherein R1 is Rw --O where Rw is hydrocarbyl containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms; R2 is halogen, hydrocarbyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or hydrogen; x is 1, 2, 3 or 4 and y is 0, 1, 2 or 3 with the proviso that x+y=4, and a transition metal compound.
      <br/>
      In this reference, reduction of surface OH content of the silica is effectuated by heating or by treatment with an aluminum compound.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The transition metal catalyst employed in the '091 patent is one that is obtained by contacting silica having reactive OH groups with a dialkylmagnesium compound in a solvent; adding a mixture of an alcohol and SiCl4 thereto with subsequent treatment with a transition metal catalyst.</p>
    <p num="9">U.S. Pat. No. 4,335,016 to Dombro provides a supported olefin polymerization catalyst which is prepared by (1) forming a mixture of a calcined, finely divided porous support material and an alkyl magnesium compound; (2) heating the mixture for a time and at a temperature sufficient to react the support and the alkyl magnesium compound; (3) reacting, by heating, the product of (2) with a hydrocarbylhydrocarbyloxysilane compound; (4) reacting, by heating, the product of (3) with a titanium compound that contains a halide; or (5) reacting the product of (2) with the reaction product of a hydrocarbylhydrocarbyloxysilane compound and a titanium compound that contains a halide; and (6) activating the catalyst product of (4) or (5) with a cocatalyst comprising hydrogen or an alkyl lithium, alkyl magnesium, alkyl aluminum, alkyl aluminum halide or alkyl zinc.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Crotty et al. "Properties of Superior Strength Hexene Film Resins", Antec, 193, pp. 1210 describes the properties of superior strength hexene copolymer resins that are prepared by the Unipol process.
      <br/>
      These resins reportedly yield films with exceptional strength properties (impact and tear strength) that are significantly higher than the standard hexene products and even higher than achieved with commercially available octene copolymers.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the resins show little or no difference in processability from standard LLDPE.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The actual physical structures of polymers and abundant changes to same under various conditions is difficult to measure precisely and is commonly done indirectly.
      <br/>
      Rheology is often used in this regard, being especially suited to study the physical changes of polymers.
      <br/>
      Specifically, rheology deals with the deformation and flow of a polymer.
      <br/>
      Data so generated is used to provide information regarding the processability and even structural characterizations of the polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      One rheological method that is typically used is conventional, high shear modification wherein disentanglement of the polymer or copolymer chains occur.
      <br/>
      If a polymer or copolymer melt is sheared mechanically, the melt may be processed in a less elastic state or possibly less viscous state than the initial resin.
      <br/>
      Effects of shear modification are typically manifested by changes in die swell, die entrance pressure losses, normal stresses and flow defects such as sharkskin surfaces and melt fracture.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Although shear modification has been observed in LDPE, wherein disentanglement of the long chain branching of the polymer can readily occur, there was contention as to whether LLDPE could be shear modified.
      <br/>
      The question was answered in an article by The, et al. entitled "Shear Modification of Linear Low Density Polyethylene", Plastics and Rubber Processing and Applications, Vol. 4, No. 2, pg. 157 (1984).
      <br/>
      In this article, LLDPE was shear modified by preshearing the LLDPE resin under high shear conditions (&gt;3.9 sec-1) in an extruder.
      <br/>
      This study indicated that shear modification of the LLDPE polymer causes disentanglement to occur in the extruder, and that the relatively, disentangled polymer can be restored to a more highly elastic, entangled state by subjecting the melt to annealing or dissolving the shear modified polymer in a solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Another rheological technique employed in the prior art to determine the physical characteristics of a polymer is to measure the polydispersity or melt elasticity, ER, of the polymer melt.
      <br/>
      This technique is described in an article by R. Shroff, et al. entitled "New Measures of Polydispersity from Rheological Data on Polymer Melts", J. Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 57, pp. 1605-1626 (1995).
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Using this rheological technique (ER calculation), prior art ethylene copolymer resins, such as described in The, et al., exhibit conventional melt elastic behavior in both the unsheared pelletized and sheared pelletized states.
      <br/>
      In the unsheared state, the ER values of prior art ethylene copolymers remain substantially unchanged in going from the powder to pellet form.
      <br/>
      Moreover, no change in ER is observed in dissolving the pellet in an organic solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As to the shear modified forms, prior art polymers exhibit a decrease in melt elasticity upon shear modification of the pelletized form.
      <br/>
      This signifies that the entanglement density of the polymer decreases.
      <br/>
      Upon dissolution of the shear modified form in an organic solvent, an increase in melt elasticity is observed with prior art ethylene copolymers.
      <br/>
      This increase in melt elasticity signifies a reversion of the polymer back to an entangled state.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In prior art ethylene copolymers, no polymeric networks, i.e. systems of interconnected macromolecular chains, are present.
      <br/>
      This is verified by the above melt elastic behavior of prior art ethylene copolymers.
      <br/>
      As is known to those skilled in the art, the presence of network structures in polymers often provides polymers having improved properties.
      <br/>
      It is emphasized that while network structures are common in styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) block copolymers--See F. Morrison, et al., "Flow-Induced Structure and Rheology of a Triblock Copolymer", J. Appl. Polymer Sci., Vol. 33, 1585-1600 (1987)--they are not known in LLDPE resins, until the advent of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The attractiveness of obtaining a network structure in LLDPE resins, however, must be tempered by the desirability of utilizing an ethylene polymerization catalyst that provides high activity.
      <br/>
      Thus, a catalyst and catalyst system which produces a LLDPE exhibiting a network structure which, in addition, provides high catalytic activity is an aim long sought in this art.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">
      The present invention provides an ethylene copolymer that exhibits unique melt elastic properties that are not present in ethylene copolymers known heretofore.
      <br/>
      The unique melt elastic properties that are exhibited by the inventive ethylene copolymer are believed to be manifested by the presence of a network structure in the copolymer resin.
      <br/>
      While not being bound by any theory, it is hypothesized that the network structure in the present ethylene copolymer is formed at least in part of a rubber phase believed present in the copolymer which serves to interconnect the hard and soft phases of the ethylene copolymer.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The presence of a network structure in the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention is verified by the fact that the copolymer resin exhibits a reactor-made-to-pellet ER increase which is reversible, i.e. reduced, upon rheometric low shear modification.
      <br/>
      The term "ER" is used herein to measure the elasticity or the polydispersity of the ethylene copolymer which is derived from rheological data on polymer melts, See the article to Shroff, et al. supra.
      <br/>
      The term "reactor-made" is used herein to denote powder, slurry or solution forms of the polymer resin which are formed in a polymerization vessel prior to melt processing.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In addition to exhibiting the above melt elastic behavior, the pelletized form of the ethylene copolymer of the present invention exhibits a decrease in melt elasticity when dissolved in an organic solvent such as xylene.
      <br/>
      The solution dissolution ER value is nearly the same as that of the original reactor-made material.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Specifically, the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention comprises ethylene, as the major component, and at least one C4-8 comonomer with the proviso that the resin, when in pelletized form, has a reduction in melt elasticity (ER) of 10% or more, to a final ER value of 1.0 or less upon rheometric low shear modification or solution dissolution.
      <br/>
      A 10-30% reduction in ER of the pelletized form of the inventive copolymer resin upon rheometric low shear modification or solution dissolution is typically observed.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention, when in reactor-made form, exhibits a partially reversible increase of 10% or more in said ER when pelletizing the same.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The term "rheometric low shear modification" is used in the present invention to indicate that the modification occurs in a rheometer that is capable of operating at shear rates of less than 1.0 sec-1 for a time period of from about 10 to about 60 minutes.
      <br/>
      This term is thus distinguishable from high shear modification, as disclosed in The, et al., supra, wherein the modification is typically carried out in an extruder, prior to being introduced into a rheometer, at shear rates of 3.9 sec-1 and higher.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The term "solution dissolution" is used herein to indicate that the pelletized form of the ethylene copolymer resin can be dissolved in an organic solvent such as xylene.
      <br/>
      The importance of this technique is that it allows a means for estimating the ER value of the original reactor-made material if the same is not available.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In addition to exhibiting unique melt elastic properties, the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention is further characterized as having a base polymer density of about 0.930 g/cm3 or less, a melt index of from about 0.01 g/10 min or greater and a rubber content of about 15 vol. % or greater.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the rubber phase of the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention contains from about 35 to about 65 alkyl branches per 1000 total carbon atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Another aspect of the present invention relates to a high-impact strength film that can be produced from the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The term "high-impact strength" is used herein to denote an impact strength, as measured using a free-falling dart, of at least about 300 g/mil or higher.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="36">As stated above, the present invention provides an ethylene copolymer resin which exhibits enhanced film impact when formed into a film, and has unique melt elastic properties which, in part, signify the presence of a network structure in the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="37">
      The ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention is characterized as containing ethylene, as the major component, and at least one C4-8 comonomer, as a minor component.
      <br/>
      In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, it is highly preferred that 1-hexene be used as the comonomer.
      <br/>
      When 1-hexene is employed as the comonomer, the resin typically contains 95% or less ethylene and the remainder being 1-hexene.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Another characteristic of the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention is that it has a base copolymer density of about 0.930 g/cm3 or below.
      <br/>
      The term "base polymer density" represents the density of the polymer resin before the addition of any additives or fillers which are commonly introduced upon processing.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the base polymer density of the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention is about 0.920 g/cm3 or below.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the base polymer density is about 0.917 g/cm3 or below.
      <br/>
      The above density ranges qualify the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention as LLDPE.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In addition to the above characteristics, the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention also contains a network structure which is believed, but not entirely known, to be formed at least in part by a rubber phase known to be present in the inventive ethylene copolymer resin.
      <br/>
      The rubber phase is characterized as being an ethylene/comonomer rubber which is highly branched, i.e. it contains from about 35 to about 65 alkyl branches per 1000 total carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The network structure is believed to interconnect the hard and soft phases of the inventive copolymer resin thereby partly providing the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention with its unusual and totally unexpected melt elastic properties.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the ethylene copolymer resin contains about 15 vol. % or greater of a rubber phase, as measured by a technique known as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) which is described, for example, in an article to F. Mirabella, et al. entitled "Morphological Explanation of the Extraordinary Fracture Toughness of Linear Low Density Polyethylenes", J. Polymer Science: Part B: Polymer Physics, Vol. 26, No. 9, August 1988, pp. 1995-2005. Specifically, the following procedure was employed in the present invention to determine the vol. % rubber in the copolymer resin: A compression-molded sample was microtomed at a specimen temperature of about -80 (degree)  C. in an LKB Ultratome V with Cryokit.
      <br/>
      The bulk specimen thus prepared was etched in n-heptane at 60 (degree)  C. for 20 minutes in a sonic bath, mounted onto a scanning electron microscope specimen stub, and sputter coated with approximately 200  Angstrom  of gold.
      <br/>
      The specimen was then analyzed in an ISI-40 SEM.
      <br/>
      This procedure removes any rubbery, amorphous or low-crystallinity, in the resin from the specimen surface and leaves definable cavities where the material was originally located.
      <br/>
      Photomicrographs were statistically analyzed with a Ziess Videoplan Image Analyzer.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the rubber particles present in the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention have an average radius, Rw, of about 0.05 to about 0.25 micrometers.
      <br/>
      The interparticle distance of the rubber particles in the rubber phase is determined using the following equation:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      where Rw is the average particle radius and  PHI  is the volume fraction (vol. % rubber/100), See S. Wu "Phase Structure and Adhesion in Polymer Blends: A Criterion for Rubber Toughening", Polymer, Vol. 26, pp. 1855 (1985).
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the rubber particles typically have an interparticle distance of 0.20 micrometers or less.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention is further characterized as having a melt index of from about 0.01 g/10 min. or greater.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention has a melt index of from about 0.5 to about 4.0 g/10 min.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Although various of the above resin properties may be known in the art, the unique melt elastic properties defined hereinbelow are not.
      <br/>
      It is this characteristic of the inventive ethylene copolymer resin which distinguishes same from all previously known ethylene copolymers.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Specifically, the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention, when in reactor-made form, has a ER value of 0.9 or below, which undergoes an increase in ER when pelletizing the reactor-made material.
      <br/>
      That is, when the original reactor-made form, i.e. powder, solution or slurry, of the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention is made into a pellet one observes a positive % ER shift.
      <br/>
      An increase from about 10 to about 80% in ER is typically observed when comparing the reactor-made material to the pellet.
      <br/>
      However, such an increase is reversible.
      <br/>
      That is, the pellet's ER value can be reduced upon rheometric low shear modification or solution dissolution.
      <br/>
      This characteristic is distinct from irreversible increase in ER observed, for example, due to polymer degradation (chain extension and/or long chain branching formation).
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In addition to the above melt elastic property, the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention, when in pelletized form, exhibits a reduction in ER to values below 1.0 after subjecting the same to rheometric low shear modification or solution dissolution.
      <br/>
      A 10-30% reduction in ER of the pelletized form of the invention copolymer resin is typically observed.
      <br/>
      This reduction in ER of the pelletized sample under rheometric low shear modification or solution dissolution signifies that the ER shift observed is reversible.
    </p>
    <p num="47">The following techniques were employed in the present invention to obtain rheological data of the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="48">
      I. Xylene Dissolution Experiments: 2 grams of polymer were dissolved into 200 ml of xylene at 110 (degree)  C. for about 1 hr.
      <br/>
      The resultant solution was allowed to cool at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The xylene solvent was allowed to slowly evaporate (typically over a period of 4-5 days).
      <br/>
      The polymer sample was recovered and dried in vacuum at 60 (degree)  C. for about 72 hours.
      <br/>
      The dried sample was then pressed into 25 mm disks for rheological measurements as described hereinbelow.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      II. Sample Preparation for Rheological Measurements: Measurement of polymer melt rheological properties were carried out in a Rheometric ARES rheometer using 25 mm disk samples having a thickness of about 1.2 mm. The disk samples were prepared by pre-pressing (pellet or powder, as necessary) using a compression press and a brass 1.2 mm template with 1 inch holes sandwiched between two 1/4 inch steel plates with a sheet of mylar film placed between the press template and steel plates.
      <br/>
      About 2-3 wt. % antioxidant (50% BHT-50% Irganox 1010) was added during disk pressing for extra stabilization.
      <br/>
      The compression press was maintained at 150 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      For polymers exhibiting powder-to-pellet changes in rheology, it is imperative to minimize flow and mixing during sample preparation.
      <br/>
      For example, pressing disks out of a polymer powder and then remelting and repressing the same disks may increase the measured ER.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      III. Rheological Measurements for ER Calculation: A standard practice for measuring dynamic rheology data in the frequency sweep mode, as described in ASTM 4440-95a, was employed herein.
      <br/>
      A Rheometrics ARES rheometer was used, operating at 150 (degree)  C., in the parallel plate mode in a nitrogen environment (in order to minimize sample oxidation/degradation).
      <br/>
      The gap in the parallel plate geometry was typically 1.2-1.4 mm and the strain amplitude was 10-20%, preferably 10% strain amplitude was employed.
      <br/>
      The range of frequencies was 0.0251 to 398.1 rad/sec.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      As disclosed in Shroff, et al. supra and U.S. Pat. No. 5,534,472 (See Col. 10, lines 20-30), ER is calculated from the storage modulus (G')and loss modulus (G") data, as follows: the nine lowest frequency points are used (5 points per frequency decade) and a linear equation is fitted by least-squares regression to log G' versus log G".
      <br/>
      ER is then calculated from the following equation:
      <br/>
      ER=(1.781 * 10-3) * G', at a value of G"=5000 dyn/cm2.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      It is understandable to those skilled in the art that nonlinearity in the log G' versus log G" plot will result in different ER values depending on the range of the data employed, which in turns relates to the range in frequency data.
      <br/>
      The procedure followed was to extend the lower end of the frequency range so that the lowermost G" value was within the range of 7 * 103 -104 dyn/cm2.
      <br/>
      Practically speaking, this requires a lowermost frequency of 0.0398 rad/sec for 1 MI LLDPEs and 0.0251 rad/sec for 0.6 MI LLDPES, at 150 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      IV. Rheometric Shear Modification: A sample was placed in the AERS rheometer and a standard frequency sweep was performed.
      <br/>
      Then, a steady preshearing was applied by specifying the shear rate and time of preshearing.
      <br/>
      Typically, the shear rate was 0.1 sec-1 and the time was 20-60 minutes.
      <br/>
      Preshearing was applied by specifying the rotational speed of the moving plate in the Rheometrics ARES rheometer.
      <br/>
      A rotational speed of about 0.01 rad/sec will result in a shear rate of 0.1 sec-1 for a 1.25 mm gap and 25 mm plates.
      <br/>
      At the end of preshearing, a standard frequency sweep was performed.
      <br/>
      Comparison of the rheometric data before and after rheometric shear modification and calculation/comparison of ER calculated from each, will show and quantify whether the polymer exhibits rheometric shear modifiability.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The above provides a description of the ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention, the description that follows is directed to the polymerization catalyst, polymerization process and film.
      <br/>
      The ethylene copolymer resin of the present invention is prepared in-situ by polymerizing ethylene and at least one C4 -C8 comonomer in the presence of an ethylene polymerization catalyst, a cocatalyst, and an optional cocatalyst modifier, under ethylene polymerization conditions.
      <br/>
      Mechanical blends of ethylene and various comonomers and/or copolymers such as ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) fall outside the realm of the present invention since they are not prepared in-situ.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      In one embodiment, the ethylene polymerization catalyst of the present invention is preferably prepared by contacting a chemically treated support material with a dialkylmagnesium compound or complex, contacting the magnesium-containing support material with either an alcohol or a silane compound and thereafter with a transition metal compound.
      <br/>
      It is again emphasized that when an alcohol is used, a hydrocarbyl alkoxysilane cocatalyst modifier is required.
    </p>
    <p num="57">Suitable support materials that may be employed in the present invention include: inorganic supports such as silica, alumina, aluminum phosphate, celite, magnesium oxide, iron oxide and organic supports including polymers and copolymers.</p>
    <p num="58">
      A preferred support material is silica.
      <br/>
      When silica is employed as the support material, it preferably pure, however, the silica may contain minor amounts of other inorganic oxides.
      <br/>
      In general, the silica support comprises at least 90-95% by weight pure silica.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the silica is at least 99% pure.
    </p>
    <p num="59">The silica support utilized in the present invention has a surface area of from about 50 to about 500 m2 /g; a particle size of from about 10 to about 200 micrometers; and a pore volume of about 0.5 to about 3.0 cc/g as determined by standard B.E.T. measurements.</p>
    <p num="60">
      Another particularly preferred support material is celite.
      <br/>
      Celite is a diatomaceous earth composition composed of approximately 4% alumina, approximately 90% silica and the remainder calcium oxide and other inorganic oxides.
      <br/>
      Celite, commercially available from Eagle-Picher Minerals, Inc., has a porosity of between about 50 to about 90 volume %; a pore volume of between about 2.4 to about 3.5 cc/g; and a surface area of between about 2 to about 100 m2 /g.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The aluminum phosphate, when employed as the support, has a preferred pore volume of between about 0.7 to about 1.25 cc/g and a preferred surface area of about 200 to about 350 m2 /g.
      <br/>
      To obtain these preferred physical characteristics, it is preferred that the aluminum phosphate be made more amorphous than pure aluminum phosphate.
      <br/>
      Thus, AlPO4 is synthesized with other agents such that the atomic ratio of phosphorus to aluminum be in the range of between about 0.70 and about 0.95. More preferably, this atomic ratio is in the range of between about 0.72 and about 0.85.
    </p>
    <p num="62">The alumina employed for use as the support is characterized by a pore volume of between about 0.8 to about 3 cc/g and a surface area of about 300 m2 /g to about 400 m2 /g.</p>

      Other pertinent physical data are also reported herein and compared to commercial ethylene copolymer resins.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      In this example, all the resins were prepared using a gas-phase fluidized bed polymerization process like the one described in Example 1.

    <p num="157">The properties of each resin determined using the techniques defined hereinabove are reported in Table 3 and are graphically illustrated in FIGS. 1-6.</p>
    <p num="158">As shown in FIGS. 1-4, the resins of the present invention typically have higher impact, more rubber phase and smaller interparticle rubber distance than prior art resins.</p>
    <p num="159">
      Of significance is that the ethylene copolymer resins of the present invention, resins 5-9, exhibited the unique melt elastic properties mentioned above, whereas prior art resins 1-4 and 10-11 did not exhibit the unique melt elastic properties.
      <br/>
      Specifically, as shown in FIG. 5, the powder form of resins 5-9 all have ER values of 0.9 or below which undergo an increase in ER when pelletizing the powder.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      Unlike the resins of the present invention, prior art resins 1-4 and 10-11 do not exhibit the same.
      <br/>
      Instead, when an increase in ER value from powder to pellet is observed, prior art powders had an initial ER value of greater than 0.8 (i.e. ER&gt;0.8, if % ER shift was greater than 0), or when the prior art powder ER is 0.8 or below, the prior art resins did not exhibit an increase in ER in going from the powder to the pellet, (i.e. % ER shift=0, if ER is 0.8 or less).
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      In addition to the above melt elastic properties, the inventive resins exhibited the melt elastic properties shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the pelletized forms of resins 5-9 exhibited a 10-30% reduction in ER to values below 1.0 after rheometric low shear modification.
    </p>
    <p num="162">In contrast thereto, prior art pelletized samples had ER&gt;1.0, if % ER shift reduction was less than 0, or they had % ER shift reduction=0, if ER was is less than 1 0 (slashed zero)</p>
    <p num="163">
      Another important property of the resins of the present invention is that an increase in ER is observed in going from the powder to the pellet.
      <br/>
      This increase is almost completely reversible when the pellet is dissolved in xylene (See, Table 4).
      <br/>
      In the case of prior art resins, the ER values remained unchanged when going from pellet to solution dissolved pellet.

    <p num="167">EXAMPLE 3</p>
    <p num="168">
      A first ethylene polymerization catalyst was prepared by treating Davison.RTM. MS 3070 silica, having a surface area of 650 m2 /g and a pore volume of 3.0 cc/g, with 20 wt. % HMDS and thereupon dried in quartz tube equipped with a fritted glass disc.
      <br/>
      The silica was fluidized with a stream of nitrogen and placed in a vertical tube furnace.
      <br/>
      The silica was heated to 150 (degree)  C. over 4 hours, held at 150 (degree)  C. for 4 hours and cooled to room temperature over a period of 1 hour.
      <br/>
      Thereupon, butylethyl magnesium (0.65 mmol), tetraethoxysilane (0.16 mmol) and titanium tetrachloride (0.65 mmol), wherein the parenthesized concentration represented the amount of the catalytic component charged per gram of silica, was deposited upon the silica, in the order recited, in accordance with the procedure set forth in Example 1.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      A second ethylene polymerization catalyst was identically prepared but for the substitution of the silica support.
      <br/>
      The silica support of the second ethylene polymerization catalyst was Davison.RTM. 948 silica having a surface area of 320 m2 /g and a pore volume of 1.6 cc/g.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      The two ethylene polymerization catalysts were separately employed to polymerize ethylene-hexane copolymers utilizing a 2.5 liter gas phase fluidized bed reactor in accordance with the procedure utilized in Example 2.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the two ethylene polymerization catalysts were separately combined with triethylenealuminum to produce separate ethylene-hexane copolymers.
    </p>
    <p num="171">In each polymerization reaction, the reactor was charged with 28 mole % ethylene, 5.7 mole % hexane-1, 5.6 mole % hydrogen and 60.7 mole % nitrogen.</p>
    <p num="172">
      Three polymerization runs were conducted with each catalyst and the results averaged.
      <br/>
      It was found that in each case an ethylene-hexane copolymer having approximately 18 butyl branches per solvent carbon was produced in all polymerization runs.
      <br/>
      The average melt index of the polymer produced utilizing the first ethylene polymerization catalyst was 0.64. Its melt elasticity was 0.79 and its ER shift was 0.41. The average density of the polymer was 0.918. It was produced such that the catalytic activity was 1,740 gms of polymer per gram of the first ethylene polymerization catalyst.
    </p>
    <p num="173">The second ethylene polymerization catalyst produced polymer having a melt index of 0.63; a melt elasticity of 0.79; an ER shaft of 0.39 and a density of 0.9173. The average catalytic activity of the second ethylene polymerization catalyst was 1,127 gms of polymer per gram of second ethylene polymerization catalyst.</p>
    <p num="174">DISCUSSION OF RESULTS OF EXAMPLE 3</p>
    <p num="175">
      The results of Example 3 establish that the preferred embodiment of the ethylene polymerization catalyst of the present invention, wherein the silica support has a very high surface area, produces polymers having equivalent physical properties to those produced by other ethylene polymerization catalysts within the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      However, the catalytic activity of this preferred ethylene polymerization catalyst is 54% greater than other embodiments of ethylene polymerization catalysts within the scope of other catalysts within the contemplation of the present invention.
