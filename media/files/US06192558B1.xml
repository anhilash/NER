      <br/>
      A device that assists in the tying of knots for tightening lines, especially ropes that hold heavy loads in place on trucks or flat bed trailers.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the invention comprises two side members, two transverse members, and a clasping member.
      <br/>
      The clasping member moves between a closed position in which the side members, the lower transverse member and the clasping member form a closed loop, and an open position in which there is an opening between the side members.
      <br/>
      The clasping member is spring loaded and biased toward the closed position.
      <br/>
      One side member is turned back to form a hook, the end of which engages the clasping member in its closed position.
      <br/>
      The upper ends of the side members extend above the upper transverse member to form ears that prevent a rope tied around that member from slipping off.
      <br/>
      The preferred method of using the device includes the following steps: Doubling a line to form a loop; pulling the loop between the transverse members; pulling the loop around the bottom portion and then up to top portion of the device; pulling the line to tighten the loop around the upper transverse member between the ears; moving the clasping member to the open position; pulling the bottom portion of the line through the gap created by opening the clasping member; releasing the clasping member so that it returns to the closed position; and securing the bottom portion of the line to the bottom portion of the device.

    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      When heavy loads need to be retained during transportation, as on a flat bed truck or trailer, it is desirable to secure them as tightly as possible.
      <br/>
      Ropes holding the loads in place may be tied around the objects, and then the slack removed from the ropes by tying "trucker's knots" in the ropes, so that the ropes are retained as tightly as possible.
      <br/>
      However, "trucker's knots" are difficult to tie, and if not tied correctly, may come undone, resulting in loss of the load.
      <br/>
      The present invention is a device that makes it possible to tie such knots more easily and securely.
      <br/>
      The following are some of the knot tying devices in the prior art:

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="25">
      The invention is a knot tying device, having in a preferred embodiment a first side member to which a locking clasp is pivotally connected, a second side member with a hooked portion to which the locking clasp is engaged when in a closed position, and two transverse members connecting the side members.
      <br/>
      When used to secure a load to a trailer, one end of the rope is tied to the trailer, and the rope is placed above the load, laying on the load.
      <br/>
      The invention is then placed in the rope.
      <br/>
      A portion of a rope to be tightened can be wound around the upper transverse member, which may have a knurled edge to prevent the rope from slipping.
      <br/>
      The remaining length of the rope is then wrapped around a hook or through a loop on the trailer.
      <br/>
      Then a portion of the rope is brought back to the invention and inserted through the locking clasp.
      <br/>
      Finally, the user pulls on the rope to tighten it, and ties the rope around the hooked portion of the invention to hold it in place.
      <br/>
      When the user pulls on the rope, the hook or loop on the trailer and the hooked portion of the invention act as wheels on a pulley.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Accordingly, it is a principal object of the invention to provide an improved means for tightening ropes or other lines that secure loads being transported.</p>
    <p num="27">It is another object of the invention to provide a device that makes it easier to tie "trucker's knots".</p>
    <p num="28">It is a further object of the invention to provide a device that makes it less likely that "trucker's knots" will come untied.</p>
    <p num="29">Still another object of the invention is to provide a means of tying knots that secure loads that makes it easier to untie the knots when it is time to release the loads.</p>
    <p num="30">It is an object of the invention to provide improved elements and arrangements thereof in an apparatus for the purposes described which is inexpensive, dependable and fully effective in accomplishing its intended purposes.</p>
    <p num="31">These and other objects of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="33">The present invention a device that assists in the tying of knots for tightening ropes or other lines, especially ropes that hold heavy loads in place on trucks or flat bed trailers.</p>
    <p num="34">
      In the preferred embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1, the mechanical trucker's knot 10 comprises a first side member 12, having a first end 14, a second end 16, and an intermediate portion 17; a second side member 18, having a first end 20, a second end 22, and an intermediate portion 24; a first transverse member 26 and a second transverse member 28, the transverse members being parallel and each having a first end 30 joined to the intermediate portion of the first side member, and a second end 32 joined to the intermediate portion of the second side member; and a clasping member.
      <br/>
      The first transverse member may have either a smooth surface, or a knurled surface to prevent a line wrapped around it from slipping.
      <br/>
      The clasping member moves between a closed position 36 (shown in solid lines) in which the first side member, the second side member, the transverse member and the clasping member form a closed loop, and open positions 38 (one of which is shown in broken lines) in which there is an opening between the first end of the first side member and the first end of the second side member.
      <br/>
      The clasping member has a first end 40 that is pivotally connected to the first end of the first side member, and a second end 42 that in the closed position is retained on the first end of the second side member, and in the open position is not so retained.
      <br/>
      The clasping member is spring loaded and biased toward the closed position.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the second side member is longer than the first side member, and the first end of the second side member is turned back to form a hook 44.
      <br/>
      The hook may function in a manner similar to the wheel of a pulley when the line is pulled tight.
      <br/>
      The second end of the clasping member has extensions 46 that matingly engage grooves 48 in the first end of the second side member, so that they may be more securely retained when in a closed position.

      Preferably, all parts of the invention, including the first and second side member, the transverse member, and the locking clamp are made of a metal that is strong and will not easily rust, such as stainless steel or aluminum.
      <br/>
      The parts may be painted or otherwise coated to prevent rust.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the first side member, the second side member, the transverse member, and the locking clamp are solid, and have, except at their ends, circular cross sections, the centers of which all lie in a single plane.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the second ends of the first and second side members extend an equal distance from the transverse members to form ears 50.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the ears may extend from the first transverse member (not shown in drawings).
      <br/>
      The purpose of the ears is to prevent a line tied around the first transverse member from slipping off.

    <p num="36">The following steps should be followed in using the invention:</p>
    <p num="37">
      1.
      <br/>
      Double a middle portion of a line (such as a rope, cord, cable, etc.) between top and bottom portions of the line, to form a loop.
      <br/>
      2. Pull the loop A between the transverse members, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      3. Pull the loop around the bottom portion of the invention, as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      4. Pull the loop from the bottom portion of the invention to the top portion of the invention, as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      5. Pull the top portion B and the bottom portion C of the line to tighten the loop between the ears against the top and bottom portions, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      6. Move the clasping member to an open position, either manually or by pushing with the bottom portion of the line.
      <br/>
      7. Pull the bottom portion of the line through the gap created by opening the clasping member, as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      8. Release the clasping member so that it returns to the closed position.
      <br/>
      9. Secure the bottom portion of the line to the bottom portion of the device, preferably by tying a double half hitch knot around the hooked portion of the second side member, as shown in FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      This method makes it possible to make the lines that secure a load much tighter than can be done with a straight pull on the lines.
      <br/>
      Multiple mechanical trucker's knots can be used to secure different portions of a line.
      <br/>
      To untie the knots so that the load can be removed, one simply reverses the steps used in tying the knots.
