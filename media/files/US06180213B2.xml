    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a planographic printing plate material which does not require liquid development, and particularly to a planographic printing plate material providing a planographic printing plate preventing image portions on the plate from dissolving during printing.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      A printing plate is ordinarily prepared by exposing to light a presensitized planographic printing plate and developing the exposed plate with liquid developer.
      <br/>
      This process, however, produces waste liquid developer which must be discarded, resulting in environmental problems.
    </p>
    <p num="3">Recently, a method (dry plate-making process) for making a printing plate without employing liquid developer has been studied, and various methods have been proposed for the dry plate-making process,</p>
    <p num="4">
      For example, there is proposed a method of preparing a planographic printing plate according to a transfer method, however, this method has a problem of producing image defects.
      <br/>
      Further, there is proposed a method preparing a planographic printing plate according to an ablation method, however, this method has a problem in that the ablated scatters and soils the surroundings, and further a specific development machine is required for forming an image in a closed system.
    </p>
    <p num="5">To the contrary, physical property change type planographic printing plate material is preferable which can form an image employing oleophile-hydrophile property change, since this material makes it possible to prepare a planographic printing plate without liquid development.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Various physical property change type planographic printing plate materials have been proposed.
      <br/>
      For example, in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 62-164049 is disclosed a planographic printing plate material comprising a hydrophilic support, and provided thereon, a recording layer containing a block isocyanate and an active hydrogen-containing resin capable of reacting with an isocyanate, wherein the support or the recording layer contains a light-heat converting compound.
      <br/>
      This technique provides improved durability at exposed portions, since isocyanate produced by heat application reacts with the resin, however, this comprises a developing step of dissolving unexposed portions with a liquid developer.
      <br/>
      When a planographic printing plate prepared from this material without liquid development after exposure is used, it produces dissolution of non-exposed portions and stains on dampening rollers during printing, resulting in adverse effects on the printing properties.
    </p>
    <p num="7">A method employing capsules was proposed, but the method has a problem of resolving power resulting from the capsule size.</p>
    <p num="8">
      In Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 51-63704 is disclosed a method of preparing a planographic printing plate, imagewise exposing to laser a planographic printing plate material without any further treatment after exposure, which has, on a support, a hydrophilic layer containing dyes and a non-light sensitive compound such as PVP, PVA, casein, dextrin, gum arabic, HEC, PEG, polyacrylic acid, or PVPA.
      <br/>
      However, this method is not necessary satisfactory, since it has problems of low sensitivity and high noise.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 4,081,572 is disclosed a physical property change type planographic printing plate material comprising a support, and provided thereon, a hydrophilic layer containing a specific hydrophilic polymer, in which the hydrophilic layer is made hydrophobic by imagewise energy exposure.
      <br/>
      In this case, change from the hydrophilic to hydrophobic layer at image portions is realized by decarboxylation of the hydrophilic polymer, and therefore, strength of the image portions and the non-image portions is not sufficient, resulting in lowering of printing durability.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In view of the above, the present invention has been made.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides a planographic printing plate prepared by a dry plate-making process, and provides a planographic printing plate material which is inexpensive, and gives improved sensitivity, S/N, and strength at image portions and non-image portions, and high resolving power.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">A first object of the invention is to provide a heat sensitive planographic printing plate material, which can provide a planographic printing plate through dry plate-making process, without requiring discarding treatment of a waste solution, and through a shortened planographic printing plate preparing process, and an image forming method employing the material.</p>
    <p num="12">A second object of the invention is to provide a heat sensitive planographic printing plate material with high sensitivity which can provide a planographic printing plate without stop stains, and with high strength at image portions and non-image portions, excellent printing durability, high water tolerance, and high resolving power, and an image forming method employing the material.</p>

    </p>
    <p num="72">
      A water soluble polymer can be also used as the binder.

      The heat sensitive planographic printing plate material of the invention preferably contains two kinds of cross-linking agents which are different in reactivity from each other.
      <br/>
      For example, a combination use of a urea resin and a melamine resin is preferable, wherein the urea resin is added in an amount enough to enhance layer strength, and image portions are formed by heating to accelerate reaction of a melamine resin, and destroying the polar groups of the hydrophilic resin.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      It is preferable that the heat sensitive planographic printing plate material of the invention contains two or more kinds of cross-linking agents and a reaction accelerating agent, which accelerates cross-linking reaction of one of the cross-linking agents.
      <br/>
      In such a heat sensitive planographic printing plate material, reaction at low temperature is reduced, and the other cross-linking agents can be effectuated on heating.
    </p>
    <p num="101">In the heat sensitive planographic printing plate material of the invention, various kinds of back coat layers can be provided on the surface of the support opposite the heat sensitive layer, in order to minimize curl of the material, and to prevent adherence of the heat sensitive layer surface to the opposite surface after exposure.</p>
    <p num="102">An image forming method in the invention includes (a) directly imagewise heating the heat sensitive layer of the heat sensitive planographic printing plate material with a thermal head, and (b) heating the heat sensitive layer by imagewise exposing it to high energy light, in which light absorbed by the layer is converted to heat.</p>
    <p num="103">
      The image forming method of directly writing with a thermal head is suitable in forming an image with a low resolving power image or a line image with low cost.
      <br/>
      The image forming method of imagewise exposing to high energy light is suitable in forming an image with a high resolving power image or a dot image as in commercial printing, since it can provide a highly precise writing.
    </p>
    <p num="104">The light source for imagewise exposure includes, for example, a laser, an emission diode, a xenon flush lamp, a halogen lamp, a carbon arc light, a metal halide lamp, a tungsten lamp, a high pressure mercury lamp, and a non-electrode light source.</p>
    <p num="105">In order to imagewise exposing to high energy light the heat sensitive planographic printing plate material, the exposure is carried out through a mask material having an image pattern made of a light shielding material employing a xenon lamp, a halogen lamp, a carbon arc light, a metal halide lamp, a tungsten lamp, a high pressure mercury lamp, or a non-electrode light source.</p>
    <p num="106">
      When an array light such as an emission diode array is used or exposure using a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp or a tungsten lamp is controlled using an optical shutter material such as liquid crystal or PLZT, a digital exposure according to an image signal is possible and preferable.
      <br/>
      In this case, direct writing is possible without using any mask material.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      When a laser is used for exposure, which can be condensed in the beam form, scanning exposure according to an image can be carried out, and direct writing is possible without using any mask material.
      <br/>
      When the laser is employed for imagewise exposure, a highly dissolved image can be obtained, since it is easy to condense its exposure spot in minute size.
      <br/>
      As the laser, argon laser, He-Ne gas laser, YAG laser or semi-conductor laser is preferably used.
    </p>
    <p num="108">Among these lasers, YAG laser and semi-conductor laser are preferable, in that they are light source with high energy suitable for the heat sensitive planographic printing plate material of the invention, relatively inexpensive, and compact.</p>

      A laser scanning method by means of a laser beam includes a method of scanning on an outer surface of a cylinder, a method of scanning on an inner surface of a cylinder and a method of scanning on a plane.
      <br/>
      In the method of scanning on an outer surface of a cylinder, laser beam exposure is conducted while a drum around which a recording material is wound is rotated, in which main scanning is represented by the rotation of the drum, while sub-scanning is represented by the movement of the laser beam.
      <br/>
      In the method of scanning on an inner surface of a cylinder, a recording material is fixed on the inner surface of a drum, a laser beam is emitted from the inside, and main scanning is carried out in the circumferential direction by rotating a part of or an entire part of an optical system, while sub-scanning is carried out in the axial direction by moving straight a part of or an entire part of the optical system in parallel with a shaft of the drum.
      <br/>
      In the method of scanning on a plane, main scanning by means of a laser beam is carried out through a combination of a polygon mirror, a galvano mirror and an F  THETA  lens, and sub-scanning is carried out by moving a recording medium.
      <br/>
      The method of scanning on an outer surface of a cylinder and the method of scanning on an inner surface of a cylinder are more suitable for high density recording because they make it easy to enhance a precision of an optical system.
    </p>
    <p num="110">The image forming process employing the heat sensitive planographic printing plate material of the invention is characterized in that imagewise exposure is all that is processed, not followed by conventional liquid development which removes the non-image portion layer with a liquid developer.</p>
    <p num="111">
      The heat sensitive planographic printing plate material is subjected to imagewise exposure by a specific light source to obtain a planographic printing plate, and printing can be carried out mounting the resulting planographic printing plate on a plate cylinder of a press.

      Further, it is also possible that the heat sensitive planographic printing plate material is mounted on the plate cylinder of the press, and subjected to imagewise exposure on the plate cylinder to obtain a planographic printing plate, followed by printing.
