      <br/>
      A programming system and method for programming a programmable memory device having multiple individually programmable memory cells, such as an electrically programmable read only memory (EPROM), includes the use of an address and programming pulse signal source and a programming and test controller for establishing, based upon the programming of a small number of on-chip sample memory cells, a presumptively sufficient initial programming pulse duration for programming the remaining memory cells.
      <br/>
      In the event it is found during actual programming that such an initial programming pulse duration is insufficient for any particular memory cell, additional programming pulses, each of which is significantly shorter in duration than the initial programming pulse, are applied to such memory cell as needed until the programming of such memory cell is completed.

    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to systems and methods for programming the memory cells of programmable memory devices, and in particular, to systems and methods for programming EPROM cells which require that multiple programming pulses be applied to selected memory cells.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">Referring to FIG. 1, as is well known in the art, the transistor forming a memory cell for an electrically programmable read only memory device (EPROM) has a floating polysilicon gate which is located between an access gate and the substrate and is electrically isolated from the substrate by a gate oxide and from the access gate by a dielectric inter-poly oxide.</p>
    <p num="6">
      During programming, a high programming voltage VPP is applied to the access gate while a lower voltage VD is applied to the drain and the source is grounded.
      <br/>
      As electrons flow from the source to the drain, they pick up kinetic energy and their path is altered by an electric field which is between the access gate and substrate and is generated by the potential difference between the programming voltage VPP on the access gate and the biasing voltage VD on the drain.
      <br/>
      Those electrons which achieve sufficient kinetic energy accelerate vertically toward the floating gate, passing through the gate oxide, and are trapped on the floating gate electrode, thereby creating a net negative voltage on the floating gate which opposes any electric field created by a positive voltage on the access gate.
      <br/>
      This results in a substantial increase in the threshold voltage required to transform the EPROM memory cell from a nonconductive state to a conductive state.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      With conventional EPROM programming techniques, a small number of sample EPROM cells are used to sample the programmability of the remaining cells.
      <br/>
      Each sample cell is programmed by applying a sample programming pulse with a known relatively short pulse width and is immediately verified.
      <br/>
      If needed, more pulses of the same short width are applied followed by further verification until such cell is fully programmed.
      <br/>
      The maximum number of such short pulses that any of the sample cells took to reach the desired programming state is then used to establish the width, i.e., duration, of a longer programming pulse that will then be applied to the remaining cells.
      <br/>
      Typically, the duration of this longer pulse is simply set equal to the combined durations of the short pulses that were used to program the slowest sample cell.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, all remaining cells are then programmed by applying one or more of such longer pulses, as required, to each cell.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Such conventional technique, however, generally results in a significant amount of wasted time in programming and verifying an EPROM device.
      <br/>
      For example, for each cell which requires multiple programming pulses, the duration of each one of such programming pulses is that of the longest programming pulse duration found necessary to program the slowest sample memory cell.
      <br/>
      However, if the cell currently being programmed is not as slow as the slowest sample cell, but requires multiple programming pulses nonetheless, a proportionately significant amount of time can be wasted by applying extra programming pulses which are longer than necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a programming technique in which advantage can be taken of the fact that it is statistically unlikely that most memory cells which are slower to program than the slowest sample memory cell will have programming times which are integer multiples of the programming time of the slowest sample cell.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 2, when using a programming system 10 and method in accordance with the present invention, a programmable memory device 12, such as an EPROM, is powered by dc power 15 provided by a power source 14, receives various programming signals 17 from a programming signal source 16 and provides programming state signals 13 to a programming controller 18 for verification of the state of programming of the memory device 12.
      <br/>
      The controller 18 provides programming control signals 19 for the signal source 16 in accordance with which the various programming signals 17 are generated.
      <br/>
      The control signals 19 include: a programming mode control signal; sample programming control signals; a sample programming pulse control signal; a programming verification control signal; main array programming control signals; an initial main array programming pulse control signal; and an auxiliary main array programming pulse control signal.
      <br/>
      In respective correspondence thereto, the programming signals 17 include; a programming mode signal; sample programming signals; a sample programming pulse; a programming verification signal; main array programming signals; an initial main array programming pulse; and an auxiliary main array programming pulse.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      More specifically, the controller 18 provides the programming mode control signal in accordance with which the signal source 16 applies a programming mode signal to the memory device 12, thereby configuring the memory device 12 in a programming mode of operation.
      <br/>
      The controller 18 then provides the sample programming control signals in accordance with which the signal source 16 applies the sample programming signals to the memory device 12.
      <br/>
      Such sample programming control signals include sample address control signals and sample data control signals in accordance with which the signal source 16 provides corresponding sample address signals and sample data signals as parts of the sample programming signals.
      <br/>
      These address signals identify the programmable sample memory cells 22 which are to be programmed, while the sample data is the data with which such sample memory cells 22 are to be programmed.
      <br/>
      The controller 18 then provides the sample programming pulse control signal in accordance with which the signal source 16 provides the sample programming pulse, having a predetermined pulse duration, to the memory device 12.
      <br/>
      Following this, the controller 18 provides the programming verification control signal in accordance with which the signal source 16 applies the programming verification signal to the memory device 12.
      <br/>
      In response to this programming verification signal, the memory device 12 provides the sample programming state signal which represents the programming state of the sample memory cell being programmed.
      <br/>
      The controller 18 compares such programming state to a sample reference state.
      <br/>
      If such programming state does not transcend the sample reference state (e.g., exceed some predetermined minimum criterion or fall below some predetermined maximum criterion), programming of the sample memory cell is repeated with further sample programming pulses, as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Once such sample cell has been programmed, a combination (e.g., sum) of the sample pulse durations required for such programming is determined.
      <br/>
      This process is then repeated for the remaining sample memory cells 22, following which one of the combinations of sample pulse durations (e.g., the maximum sum) is selected for establishing the pulse duration for the initial programming pulse for programming the main array memory cells 32.
      <br/>
      Also established is the pulse duration of the auxiliary programming pulse, with such auxiliary programming pulse duration being shorter than the initial programming pulse duration.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      It should be noted that, in accordance with the present invention, other combinations of sample pulse durations can be used, as desired, for establishing the initial programming pulse duration.
      <br/>
      For example, other than the maximum sum of the sample pulse durations used for programming, the minimum sum can be used or some form of average of the sums of the various sequences of sample pulse durations used for programming the sample memory cells 22 can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Following programming of the sample memory cells 22, each of the main array memory cells 32 is then programmed using the initial main array programming pulse and, as necessary, the auxiliary main array programming pulse(s).
      <br/>
      With the programming mode control signal asserted and the corresponding programming mode signal applied, the controller 18 provides the main array programming control signals which include the address and program data for the specific main array memory cell(s) 32 intended to be programmed.
      <br/>
      In accordance therewith, the signal source 16 applies the appropriate main array programming signals to the memory device 12.
      <br/>
      The controller 18 then provides the initial main array programming pulse control signal in accordance with which the signal source 16 applies the initial main array programming pulse having the predetermined pulse duration (as discussed above) to the addressed main array memory cell(s) 32. Subsequent thereto, the controller 18 provides the programming verification control signal in accordance with which the signal source 16 again applies the programming verification signal to the memory device 12.
      <br/>
      In response thereto, the memory device 12 provides a main array programming state signal which represents the programming state of the main array memory cell(s) 32 being programmed.
      <br/>
      The controller 18 compares this programming state to a main array reference state. (Preferably, although not necessarily, the main array reference state is the same as the aforementioned sample reference state.) If such programming state transcends the main array reference state, then the next one/group of the remaining memory cells 32 is/are programmed similarly.
      <br/>
      However, if such programming state does not transcend the main array reference state, then the controller 18 provides the auxiliary programming pulse control signal in accordance with which the signal source 16 applies the auxiliary main array programming pulse having a predetermined pulse duration to the memory device 12 for further programming of the previously addressed main array memory cell(s) 32. Following this, the aforementioned application of the programming verification signals and testing of the main array programming state is repeated, following which this application of auxiliary programming pulses is repeated as necessary until such time as the programming state of the addressed main array memory cell(s) 32 transcends the main array reference state.
      <br/>
      The remaining main array memory cells 32 are then similarly programmed with the initial programming signals, as well as the auxiliary programming signals as necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Referring to FIG. 3, the above-described programming operation can also be illustrated as follows.
      <br/>
      The top waveform represents that portion of the programming operation when the sample memory cells 22 (FIG. 2) are programmed so as to determine the duration of the initial programming pulse for the remaining memory cells 32.
      <br/>
      Predetermined sample programming pulses PS are applied with corresponding interposed test periods T for performing verification tests upon the programming state of the sample cell.
      <br/>
      When proper programming has been verified, the sum of the sample programming pulse PS durations is used to establish the initial programming pulse PI duration for the remaining memory cells 32 (FIG. 2), as discussed above.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, for each of the remaining memory cells 32, an initial programming pulse PI is applied, followed by a verification period T. As discussed above, in the event that programming is not yet complete, auxiliary programming pulses PA (followed by corresponding verification periods T) are applied as necessary until programming is completed. (These waveforms are intended to represent the programming and testing time periods and are not intended to necessarily represent the polarities of the programming pulses; e.g., depending upon the specific type of programmable memory device, the actual pulses could have their peak amplitudes between zero and a positive voltage, zero and a negative voltage, two positive voltages, two negative voltages or a positive voltage and a negative voltage.)
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5 together, the above-described differences between conventional programming techniques and a programming technique in accordance with the present invention can be represented as shown.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 represents a conventional programming operation for the remaining memory cells 32 (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      The height of each box represents the duration of the long programming pulse, and the number of the boxes stacked vertically indicates how often they are applied.
      <br/>
      For example, according to FIG. 4, in order to complete programming of the remaining cells 32, the first cell took two long programming pulses, the second cell took one, the third cell took three, and so on.
      <br/>
      In contrast thereto, according to FIG. 5, when programming in accordance with the present invention, in addition to the initial long programming pulse, the first cell took one auxiliary pulse, the second cell took none, the third cell took six, and so on.
      <br/>
      As is apparent from the total height of these "stacks" the average combined programming pulse width, or effective programming time, for each cell can and often will be smaller than that required by conventional programming operations.
    </p>
