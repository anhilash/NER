      An improved method and apparatus for displaying functional or decorative window treatments which permits one person to form and modify the window treatment without requiring specialized skills or training.
      <br/>
      The preferred method uses hook and loop type fastening means to secure various window treatment panels to an adjustable telescoping support bar such that a means is attached to all sides of the bar, and a means is attached to a portion of each window treatment panel.
      <br/>
      The invention permits multiple window treatment panels to be attached to a single support bar in a manner that achieves an overlapping of panels in multiple layers on a single rod.
      <br/>
      Interchangeable panels permit frequent reconfiguration of the panels.

    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to an improved method of supporting and displaying window treatment panels.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to a method for hanging curtain panels to provide a custom designed wall or window treatment quickly and inexpensively.
      <br/>
      Typically a window treatment curtain is hung by means of pockets, staples, or tacks, from a horizontal rod or cornice board attached to the wall over a window.
      <br/>
      Multiple rods are required to obtain a layered effect with existing support methods.
      <br/>
      The conventional method also requires the entire window treatment to be attached to the support means before hanging the panels on the wall.
      <br/>
      The size and weight of the panels often requires two people to hang the panels in a conventional manner.
      <br/>
      The present invention overcomes these problems by providing a method that one person can hang and overlay multiple curtain sections on a single support which has been previously attached to the wall.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Curtains and draperies are typically hung by hooks, rings, or a rod pocket supported by a rod or cornice board.
      <br/>
      In the event that a layered look is desired, the conventional technique is to use multiple rods or complex rods in order to support the multiple layers.
    </p>
    <p num="4">The disadvantages in the conventional presentation techniques are that the equipment is relatively expensive, that it is difficult to properly hang the window treatments, and that the complexity of the technique is such that the treatments are not routinely modified.</p>
    <p num="5">
      One object of the present invention is to present a hook and loop attachment means integral to both the window treatment and the support means so that window treatment panels can be easily installed and removed by one person.
      <br/>
      Another object of the present invention is to present universal panel types to window treatment supports that can be coordinated in a variety of shapes, sizes, and prints with a single layer, or can be combined to create a layered effect.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Another object of the current invention is to provide easily interchangeable panels for varying the seasonal window treatment.</p>
    <p num="7">Another object of the current invention is to provide a width-adjustable support bar which provides temporary attachment surfaces on all surfaces of the support bar.</p>
    <p num="8">
      In the preferred embodiment, a rectangular cross-section, adjustable-width, support bar is substantially covered with a hook and loop attachment means, and window treatment panels have a complementary hook and loop attachment means so that the panels, curtains, wall hangings, tapestries, banners, quilts, and swags can be hung on various portions of the support bar.
      <br/>
      This hanging device can be used for many types of decorative or functional window treatments.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The support means may include flat rods, round rods, square rods, arched rods, triangular rods, rectangular rods, other polygonal rods, cornice boards, pipes, tubes, dowels, or boards of various shapes and sizes and shelves.
      <br/>
      The support means may be fixed in length, or may be telescoping to provide an adjustable length.
      <br/>
      The support means may be constructed from wood, metal, plastic, bendable pipe, PVC pipe, metal pipe, dowels, other synthetic material, or any other type of suitable material.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The window treatment panels are preferably attached to the support means with a hook and loop attachment means.
      <br/>
      Typically, each panel has a hook or loop strip, patch or series of strips or patches sewed or glued to the front or back of the panel.
      <br/>
      The panel or panels will then adhere to the support means with the hook and loop attachment.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      One purpose of the hook and loop attachment means of hanging the window treatment panels is the ease in hanging the support bar first and then applying either a decorative or functional window treatment.
      <br/>
      Another objective is to provide a method that permits a simple removal of the treatment from the support for cleaning without having to take down the rod.
      <br/>
      Another purpose is that all sides or planes of the support bar are functional, thereby providing a multi-layered appearance capability with the use of only one bar or rod.
      <br/>
      Seasonal applications such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, spring, fall, and summer curtains, banners, quilts, can easily be interchanged without removing the rod from the wall.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the invention permits an easy way to change the decor in a child's room as the child matures.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The consumer has the ability to use creativity to mix, match and create his or her own designs and styles as the panels are available individually rather than in sets.
      <br/>
      The panels can be constructed to be reversible for additional variety in decor.
      <br/>
      The panels are interchangeable for economy in redecorating a room.
      <br/>
      An example is that if the end panels are floral printed and the center valances are plaid, the plaid valances could still be used while the end panels are exchanged for a different print, or the plaid panels could be used in a different room with new end panels.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The prior art includes references to hook and loop attachment means. U.S. Pat. No. 5,146,972 to W. Tacchella discloses a hook and loop fasting means as part of a method to provide a curved arc window treatment. U.S. Pat. No. 5,544,692 issued on Aug. 13, 1996 to McMichael discloses curtain draping hardware and method for draping curtains.</p>

      <br/>
      An object of the present invention is to provide more attachment surfaces in order to permit more elaborate window treatments and additional layers of panels.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the preferred embodiment, an adjustable support bar is provided with attachment surfaces integral to all exposed exterior surfaces so that window panels may be attached to all exterior surfaces of the support bar.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="19">
      Referring now to FIG. 1, an elaborate window treatment with multiple window treatment panels with decorations is illustrated.
      <br/>
      The various window panels include a left gingerbread panel 1 which is attached to the front surface of a support bar and also attached to the left end surface of the bar.
      <br/>
      The gingerbread panel makes a right angle with respect to the window wall.
      <br/>
      The gingerbread panels are prepared by attaching the panels to the ends of the bar and wrapping the panels around the edge of the bar while aligning the crease lines to the corner of the support bar.
      <br/>
      The crease lines are prepared by pressing the panels with a hot iron to prepare a sharp crease.
      <br/>
      A similar right gingerbread panel 2 is attached to the front surface of the bar and to the right end surface of the bar.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A left lace panel 3 and a right lace panel 4 are attached to the bottom surface of the bar.
      <br/>
      A left small rick rack 5 and a right small rick rack 6 are attached to the back surface of the bar, thereby creating a depth between the gingerbread panels and the rick rack panels.
      <br/>
      The center large rick rack panel 7 is attached on the top surface of the bar.
      <br/>
      The larger rick rack panel has a narrow lip which is substantially perpendicular to the main panel, so that the lip can be attached to the top of the support bar.
      <br/>
      Additional decorations, the rosettes 9 and 10, are attached to the front surface of the bar between the larger rick rack panel and the gingerbread panels.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring now to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the preferred support means is accomplished with an adjustable rectangular support bar 20 having the hook portion of a hook and loop attachment means 21 substantially covering all surfaces of the support bar.
      <br/>
      The adjustable bar includes an outer hollow rectangular section 36 and an inner hollow rectangular section 37 which slides within the hollow outer section.
      <br/>
      The bar is mounted to the wall with standard brackets or through a right mounting block 28 and a left mounting block 29.
      <br/>
      Both sections of the support rod include a front surface 22, a rear surface 23, a top surface 24, a bottom surface 25.
      <br/>
      The support rod also includes a left end surface 26, and a right end surface 27.
      <br/>
      The preferred dimensions of the support bar for windows up to 3 feet in width is approximately 2 inches in height, 1 inch in depth, and a length that is generally about 2 to 3 inches wider than the window on each side of the window.
      <br/>
      The preferred material of construction is an extruded polymer such as PVC, polypropylene, or polyethylene.
      <br/>
      Alternative materials include other plastics, aluminum, fiberglass, or any material or composition that has sufficient strength to support the curtain panels.
      <br/>
      The outer section of the support bar is covered with the hook and loop attachment fabric.
      <br/>
      The fabric is preferably glued to the support bar.
      <br/>
      The inner section of the support bar is indented approximately 1/8" along each surface, and the fabric is attached within the indention.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Alternatively, the inner section may include non-indented surfaces with fabric attached to the entire surface.
      <br/>
      In this case, the inner section dimensions are about 3/16" less than the outer section to permit attachment of the fabric where the inner section can slide into the outer section.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Referring now to FIG. 3B, the bar width permits attachment of the support bar 20 into the window's wood framing studs with most construction.
      <br/>
      One method of mounting the support rod is through a mounting block 28 which is typically glued to the end of the back of the support bar or formed with the bar.
      <br/>
      The function of the mounting block is to provide an offset between the window wall and the support device to permit a three-dimensional effect to the window treatment.
      <br/>
      The mounting blocks have a preferred width of about 3 inches, a thickness of about 1 inch, and a height equivalent to the support bar.
      <br/>
      The adjustable support bar inner and outer sections are preferably solid along at least the last 3 inches at the mounting ends in order to provide a material to secure the mounting bolts or screws.
      <br/>
      In the event that the support bar is secured to a wood stud 33, the preferred wall attachment means is wood screws 31.
      <br/>
      The mounting holes are preferably pre-drilled and countersunk.
      <br/>
      Other standard attachment means such as expanding sheetrock bolts may also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring now to FIG. 3A, the support bar can be mounted with conventional means such as an end plate 54.
      <br/>
      The end plate is typically formed in a c-shape to receive the end of the support bar, which is held at an offset from the wall by a tab 55 or a set screw 56.
      <br/>
      The end plate is mounted on the wall with screws or bolts 31.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Referring now to FIG. 4, which is a cross sectional view looking to the left of the FIG. 1 embodiment, the left gingerbread panel 1 is attached to the front surface of a support bar 20 the left lace panel 3 is attached to the bottom surface of the support bar, the left small rick rack 5 is attached to the back surface of the support bar, and the center large rick rack panel 7 is attached on the top surface of the support bar.
      <br/>
      The rosette 9 is omitted for clarity.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring now to FIG. 5, the support bar 20, which is shown as an alternative solid bar, is preferably substantially covered with the hook portion of a strong hook and loop attachment means 21 such as a pressure sensitive hook and loop fabric material sold at craft stores.
      <br/>
      The support bar could be covered with the loop portion of the hook and loop attachment means, however, that would require the window treatment panels to have the hook portion of the attachment means, thereby increasing the likelihood of snagging of window panels during handling.
      <br/>
      In practice, placing the hook portion on the support bar has provided a stronger bond than placing the loop portion on the support bar.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Referring now to FIG. 6, the preferred method of securing the window treatment panels is to attach a strip of the loop portion of a hook and loop attachment means 34 to the panel 7.
      <br/>
      The strip may be placed on either the front or rear of the panel depending upon whether the panel is intended to be hung in front of other panels, such as on the front or top surface of the bar; or behind other panels, such as on the rear or bottom surfaces of the bar.
      <br/>
      The preferred strip thickness is 0.5 to 1.0 inches, and the strip is preferably attached by sewing the strip to the panel so that one edge of the strip is approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch from the edge of the panel.
      <br/>
      The opposite side of the panel is typically decorated with a strip of gimp 35 and sewn with thread the same color as the gimp in order to hide the stitching.
      <br/>
      Alternately, the hook and loop material may be applied with an adhesive or by other fastening means.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      This particular window treatment is only one of a large number of possible treatments which may be accomplished though the use of the removable panels in the bar with the hook and/or loop attachment means.
      <br/>
      Each of the panels described in this embodiment can vary according to color, size, texture, shape, pattern, and theme.
      <br/>
      One important aspect of this embodiment is the construction of an elaborate treatment from relatively simple window treatment panels using a versatile support bar with a temporary attachment means.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Alternate Embodiment--Supports</p>
    <p num="30">Referring now to FIG. 7, there are many geometric support embodiments of the current invention of substantially covering each surface of the support with a temporary attachment means.</p>

    <p num="43">
      Referring now to FIG. 8, various styles and designs of valances are illustrated.
      <br/>
      A valance is a short window treatment.
      <br/>
      One or more valance may be used between two side panels.
      <br/>
      These valances would typically have the loop portion of a hook and loop attachment means near the top edge, on either the front or rear of the valance.
      <br/>

    <p num="45">
      Referring now to FIG. 9, various styles and designs of swags are illustrated.
      <br/>
      A swag is a window treatment which is curved between its ends.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9A illustrates a veil swag 240 where both ends attach to a support means.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9B illustrates two tapered veils 245 where the upper ends would typically attach to a support bar means and the lower ends would typically attach to support pegs.
      <br/>
      An object of the present invention is to permit the swags to be interchangeable and to permit easy substitution of swags for panels and valances.
    </p>
    <p num="46">Alternate Embodiment--Side Panels</p>
    <p num="47">
      Referring now to FIG. 10, various styles and designs of side panels are illustrated.
      <br/>
      These side panels typically have a loop attachment strip on the top front or rear edge.
      <br/>
