      In order to reduce a partially concentrated load affecting a spring seat by repulsion of the coil spring, an edge of the upper end of the coil spring is disposed against a portion of the spring seat having a relatively low solidity.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to eliminate the problem that the coils of the coil spring interfere with each other if a mid-portion of the coil spring in vertical direction is offset to the side to provide a partially concentrated load.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a method of mounting a coil spring of a suspension system between a suspension component and a body component of a vehicle and structure for mounting the coil spring to the body component.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to such a method and the structure which are adapted to reduce a partially concentrated load which affects the spring seat by repulsion of a coil spring.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">Coil springs such as suspension springs, which have essentially vertically oriented axis, are known to be mounted between a suspension component and a body component in a manner wherein a lower end of the coil spring is supported on the suspension component such as a lower link, and wherein an upper end is attached to the body component via a spring seat.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of mounting a coil spring of a suspension system between a suspension component and a body component of a vehicle comprising a simple arrangement capable of reducing a partially concentrated load which affects a spring seat by repulsion of the coil spring.</p>
    <p num="6">It is another object of the present invention to provide a structure for mounting a coil spring which comprises a simple arrangement which will reduce a partially concentrated load and effect a spring seat by repulsion of a coil spring.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In brief, the above objects are achieved by an arrangement wherein, in order to reduce a partially concentrated load affecting a spring seat which is generated by repulsion of a coil spring, the arrangement comprises an edge of the upper end of the coil spring being disposed against a portion of a spring seat having a relatively lower rigidity or solidity as it will be referred to hereafter.
      <br/>
      Thus, the partially concentrated load is absorbed by the spring seat, and interference between turns of the coils is prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="8">More specifically, a first aspect of the invention resides in a method of mounting a coil spring of a suspension on a vehicle body comprising: disposing a lower end of the coil spring against a suspension component; disposing an upper end of the coil spring against a spring bracket via a spring seat; connecting the spring bracket to a vehicle body; and disposing an edge of the upper end of the coil spring against a portion of the spring seat having a relatively lower solidity.</p>
    <p num="9">A second aspect of the invention resides in a structure for mounting a coil spring of a suspension to a vehicle body comprising: a coil spring disposed against a suspension component at it s lower end and disposed against a spring bracket via a spring seat at its upper end; the spring bracket being connected to a vehicle body; the spring seat including a relatively lower solidity portion which accepts an edge of the upper end of the coil spring.</p>

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">Referring to the attached drawings, FIGS. 1 and 2 show a double wishbone type rear suspension system of a vehicle, which in this instance is, merely by way of example, provided on the left side of the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="12">
      An outboard end 3a of a side rod 3 is connected, so as to be pivotal in the vertical direction, to a lower and rear part of an axle 2 which rotatably supports a road wheel 1.
      <br/>
      The side rod 3 extends laterally with respect to the vehicle and is movably connected so as to be pivotal, in the vertical direction, with respect to a body member 4, such as a suspension member, at an its inboard end 3b.
      <br/>
      An outboard end 5a of a lower link 5 is pivotally connected to a lower and front part of the axle 2.
      <br/>
      An inboard end 5b of the lower link 5, which extends approximately laterally with respect to the vehicle, is pivotally connected the body member 4.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      An outboard end of an upper link 6, which is formed by an A-shaped arm, is pivotally connected to an upper part of the axle 2 via a ball joint 7.
      <br/>
      Each of two connection points at the inboard ends of the upper link 6 is connected to the body component 4 via a bush 8.
      <br/>
      An axis L1 about which the inboard end of the upper link 6 is pivotal, has an inclination to a center axis of a vehicle body.
      <br/>
      The suspension is set up to provide an anti-lift geometry through the inclined axis L1 since the upper link 6 pulls an upper part of the axle 2 forward with respect to the longitudinal axis (the front and rear direction) of the vehicle when the wheel 1 bounds from a neutral position.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A first end 10a of a trailing arm 10 is movably connected in vertical direction to a lower and front part of the axle 2.
      <br/>
      The trailing arm 10 extends slantwise with respect to the vehicle, and a second end 10b of the trailing arm 10 is movably connected to the body member 4.
      <br/>
      The trailing arm 10 effects the axle 2 by pulling it forward when the wheel bounds and rebounds from the neutral position.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Therefore, the suspension link structure of this embodiment is arranged such that the axle 2, in other words the wheel 1, moves only in the fore-and-aft direction of the vehicle in the case when the wheel 1 bounds or rebounds from neutral position, and the upper part of the axle 2 moves as if it were pulled forward in fore-and aft direction of the vehicle at least when the wheel 1 bounds.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The letter "G" denotes a center of gravity of the axle, which in this embodiment, is almost coincident with the center of wheel 1.
      <br/>
      A lower end 9a of a shock absorber 9 is connected to the upper part of the axle 2.
      <br/>
      The shock absorber 9 is disposed in a manner wherein its axis is essentially vertical, and an upper part 9d thereof is connected to the body component 14 via a mount rubber.
      <br/>
      A reference character `9b` shows the position of a lower part of the shock absorber 9 which is connected to the axle 2 in normal position, `9a` shows the case of bound position, and `9c` shows the case of rebound position.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The reference numeral 12 denotes a stabilizer, which is connected to the upper link 6 via a connecting rod (not shown).
      <br/>
      The reference numeral 13 denotes a drive shaft, which has an outboard connecting part pivotally connected to a hub 20 of the wheel 1 via a first constant velocity joint, and an inboard connecting part which is pivotally connected to a differential device 21 via a second constant velocity joint.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A recess 3c for mounting a coil spring 11 is formed in a middle part of the side rod 3.
      <br/>
      A lower end of the coil spring 11, which is a suspension spring in this arrangement, is fixed to the side rod 3 as a suspension component, via disposition of its lower end into the recess 3c.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A projection 43 which acts as a stopper for the coil spring 11 and which provides a rotation preventing function, is formed in the recess 3c.
      <br/>
      This projection 43 locates an edge of a lower end of the coil spring 11 in a determined position so that an edge of an upper end of the coil spring 11 is disposed on the far side, in the fore-and-aft direction, at least, of the inclined surface.
      <br/>
      This projection also prevents rotation of the spring 11.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The rotation preventing effect is not limiting on the projection 43, and another structure, which can determine the position of the edge of the lower end of the coil spring 11, is suitable for use with this invention.
      <br/>
      For example, a spirally inclined surface conducting the edge of the lower end of the coil spring 11 and directing it to a circumference direction is formed in the recess 3c, the position of the edge of the lower end of the coil spring 11 is determined by attaching the edge to a gap provided an end of the spiral inclined surface.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The coil spring 11, whose axis extends vertically, is connected to the body component 14 at its upper end via a spring bracket 30.
      <br/>
      The spring bracket 30 in this embodiment has a structure shown in the plan view of FIG. 3, the cross-sectional rear view of FIG. 4, and the cross-sectional side view of FIG. 5.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The spring bracket 30 includes a spring guide 31 which is disposed at the center of the spring bracket 30, a spring receiving part 32 which is disposed at an outer circumference of the spring guide part 31, and a connecting part 33 which is disposed at an upper side of the spring guide 31.</p>
    <p num="23">The spring guide 31 comprises a conical shaped cylindrical member whose diameter reduces downwardly, and is almost coaxially insertable into the upper end 11a of the coil spring 11.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The spring receiving member 32, which is integrally connected to an upper part of the spring guide 31, comprises a plate which is disposed about an outer circumference of the spring guide 31.
      <br/>
      A seat rubber 34 is bonded to a lower surface of the spring receiving member 32, and a mount rubber 35 is bonded to the upper and outer surfaces thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      A slit 50 is provided between a spring fitting part 34a of the seat rubber 34, to which the coil spring is attached, and the spring receiving part 32 at an inner circumferential side of the seat rubber 34.
      <br/>
      Further, a slit 51 is provided between the spring fitting part 34a and the spring receiving part 32 at an outer circumferential side of the seat rubber 34.
      <br/>
      These slits 50, 51, make it possible to improve the durability of the seat rubber 34 by relieving a load which may be applied by the coil spring 11.
      <br/>
      It is, however, not necessary to form a slit in an outer circumference of left side of the seat rubber 34 shown in FIG. 4 when there is sufficient distance between the spring fitting part 34a and an end of the seat rubber 34 in radial direction.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In this embodiment, a rear part of an upper surface of the spring receiving part 32 is formed as an inclined surface which is inclined toward the rear of the vehicle body as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      This coincides with an inclination of a bracket fitting surface 45 of the body component 14 which is provided to improve the trunk room space at a rear side of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      As a result, a thickness of the seat rubber 34, which is attached to a lower surface of the spring bracket 30, is relatively thin at a portion which is opposed to the bracket fitting surface 45.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Two projections 36, which form the rotation preventing device, project outwardly from the spring receiving part 32 at its outer circumference, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 5.
      <br/>
      These projections 36 are made of rubber and it is accordingly possible to prevent noise when the projections 36 contact other parts of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As described above, the spring bracket 30 includes the connecting part 33.
      <br/>
      In this arrangement the connecting part is made of a plate which bridges across an inner circumference of an upper end of the spring guide part 31, and is provided with a securing hole 33a at a center portion of the spring bracket 30 as seen in plan view.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      A pin 37 is attached to the securing hole 33a shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The pin 37 projects in an upper direction, namely toward the body component 14, in a manner which fixes a base part 37a of the pin 37 to the securing hole 33a, and is provided with a hook-shaped part 38.
    </p>
    <p num="30">A first end 38a of the hook-shaped part 38 is axially supported to a top part 37b of the pin 37, and a second end 38b of the hook-shaped part 38 is pre-loaded extending to circumferential direction.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Reference numeral 39, shown in FIG. 6, denotes a body bracket which comprises a part of the body component 4.
      <br/>
      The body bracket 39 is a plate structure which is formed in a shape so that an inner surface of the bracket 39 is able to match an outer surface of the spring bracket 30.
      <br/>
      The spring bracket 30 is attached to the body bracket 39 as the body component 14 via the rubber mount 35 by fitting the spring bracket 30 into the body bracket 39 from lower side.
    </p>
    <p num="32">An end 11b of the upper part of the coil spring 11 is attached to a relatively thick portion of the seat rubber 34 by fitting the upper terminal end 11b to the spring bracket 30 in a condition that the end 11b is disposed to a forward side in the fore-and-aft direction of the vehicle body.</p>
    <p num="33">
      A fitting hole 39a is provided at a center portion of the body bracket 39 as seen in plan view.
      <br/>
      The pin 37 goes through the fitting hole 39a and is secured to the fitting hole 39a by engagement with the second end 38b of the hook-shaped part 38 to the upper end of the body bracket 39.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Thus, the spring bracket 30 is attached to the body component 14 by the pin 37.
      <br/>
      The body bracket 39 includes a second projection 40, which is projected inwardly at an inner circumference of the body bracket 39 and is engaged between two of first projections 36 (shown in FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      A rotational movement of the spring bracket 30 surrounding the pin 37 to the body component 14, in other words, a displacement in circumferential direction, is prevented by the disposition of the second projection 40 between two of first projections 36.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In this embodiment, the spring bracket 30 is connected to the body bracket 39, as a part of the body component 14, at an inner circumferential position from the spring receiving part 32.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is not necessary to provide a flange at the outer circumference of the spring receiving part 32 for attaching the spring bracket 30 to the body bracket 39.
      <br/>
      As a result, the space required for upper mount structure is reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Additionally, it is only necessary to provide the one body bracket 39 for fitting the spring bracket 30 and to perforate one securing hole 33a in the body component 14 for mounting the coil spring 11 to the body component.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to use a simply a mounting structure which is easy to work with, even though a part of the body component 14 which is opposed to the spring bracket 30 has an inclined surface, and to reduce the space occupied by mounting the upper end of 11a of the coil spring 11.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In the above described embodiment for mounting a coil spring, it is easy to avoid the problem wherein the edge 11b, where the density of spirals of the coil spring 11 is highest, is attached to a portion of the seat rubber 34, which is relatively thin, and thus has a relatively high solidity.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a partially concentrated load, which is transmitted from the coil spring 11 to the seat rubber 34, is reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Consequently, it is possible to eliminate the possibility the turns of the coil spring 11 interfere with each other in the event that a mid-portion of the coil spring 11, in the vertical direction, is offset to the side in a manner which causes a partially concentrated load.</p>
    <p num="39">
      Additionally, this embodiment can be implemented by a simple method of setting the edge 11b of the coil spring 11 to seat against a predetermined portion of the seat rubber 34, and thus obviate the need for a change in the structure of the spring bracket.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to eliminate shortening the length of the coil spring 11 mounted to the spring bracket 30.
    </p>
    <p num="40">Since the position of the edge of the lower end of the coil spring 11 is determined by the projection 43 of the side rod 3, it is possible to prevent sliding of the upper terminal end or edge 11b of the coil spring 11 which is located at the other end thereof in a circular direction relative to the seat rubber 34 after mounting and during use of the suspension.</p>
    <p num="41">
      Although the invention has been described with respect to mounting the coil spring of a rear suspension of a vehicle which has the trunk room, this invention can be applied to a front suspension or to any other type of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      In such a case, it is possible to implement the invention by disposing the upper end of the coil spring against a surface of the body component which is opposed to the spring bracket thus avoiding a relative lowering in vertical direction.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Although the invention has been described with respect to the case that there is an inclined portion at the attaching surface of the body component opposed to the spring bracket, if the attaching surface is plane surface, the invention according to the appended claims, should be designed so that the upper edge of the coil spring is attached to a relatively lower solid portion of the seat rubber by changing the height and solidity of the seat rubber in a circular direction by way of, for example, inserting a similar member between the attaching portion and an upper surface of the spring bracket.
      <br/>
      Or, the solidity of the seat rubber in a circular direction may be designed by way of changing the material thereof In a circular direction.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Although the invention has been described with respect to securing the edge of the lower end of the coil spring to the suspension component through the rotation preventing device, the appended claims are not limited thereto.
      <br/>
      However, there is a possibility that the position of the upper edge of the coil spring may move in a circular direction in use of the suspension if the lower edge of the coil spring is not secured to the suspension component.
