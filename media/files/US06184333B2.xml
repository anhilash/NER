    <p num="5">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="6">
      The cost and weight of aerospace structures can be significantly reduced by the application of high-performance polymeric composites.
      <br/>
      By replacing metallic components with composite materials, significant weight and cost savings between 25 and 30 percent can be realized.
      <br/>
      The advent of high modulus fibers and thermally stable polymers made it possible for the introduction of composites into 316 (degree)  C. (600 (degree)  F.) temperature regimes.
      <br/>
      To this end, researchers at NASA Lewis Research Center developed a high-temperature addition polyimnide called PMR-15, which, over several decades, became the high-temperature matrix resin "work horse" for the aerospace industry.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      For composite applications in the range of 250 (degree)  C. to 325 (degree)  C. the resin system of choice generally has been the PMR-15 polyimide (polymerization of Monomeric Reactants, 1500 molecular weight).
      <br/>
      The reactant monomers for PMR-15 consist of the monomethyl ester of 5-norbornene 2,3-dicarboxylic acid (nadic ester, NE), the dimethyl ester of 3,3',4,4'-benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid (BTDE), and 4,4'-methylenedianiline (MDA).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      For PMR-type solutions, the number of moles of each monomer can be determined by the following ratio: 2:n:n+1, where 2 represents the moles of endcap, n equals the moles of the dialkyl ester of the aromatic tetracarboxylic acid, and n+1 quantifies the moles of the diarine.
      <br/>
      For PMR-15, this molar ratio becomes 2 NE: n=2.087 BTDE: n+1=3.087 MDA, which corresponds to a formulated molecular weight of 1500 for the imidized pre-polymer.
      <br/>
      At this molecular weight, a balance between thermo-mechanical properties and processing characteristics can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the reaction sequence of PMR-15, heating the monomers promotes reaction which forms the linear poly(amic acid) pre-polymer.
      <br/>
      Further heating converts the amic acid groups into the stable heterocyclic imide rings.
      <br/>
      Both reactions are considered "condensation" type since methanol and water are released as by-products.
      <br/>
      In actuality, there are many competing reactions that can occur during the imidization of PMR-15.
      <br/>
      These reactions are complex and lead to prepolymers that contain a variety of chemical functionality such as imide, amide, ester, and anhydride.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      PMR-15 contains 4,4'-methylenedianiline (MDA), a known animal carcinogen, a suspected human carcinogen, and a known kidney and liver toxin.
      <br/>
      When quantities of PMR-15 prepreg are being manufactured, or when this material is being pr oduced into composite structures, exposure to MDA becomes a serious health hazard.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Thus it has become necessary for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to issue and enforce very strict regulations regarding worker exposure to MDA.
      <br/>
      In fact, the permissible (human inhalation) exposure limit (PEL) defined by OSHA has been set at 10 parts/billion per eight hour shift.
      <br/>
      In most manufacturing facilities, this means dedicated work space in which all personnel must wear disposable booties, coveralls, dust masks, and gloves; and all personnel leaving the facility are required to shower.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Disposal of waste materials resulting from the manufacture of PMR-15 composite components is also a significant problem.
      <br/>
      Utmost care must be taken in handling uncured PMR-15 waste since it contains substantial quantities of unreacted MDA.
      <br/>
      Typically, 20-30% of the prepreg material issued to the manufacturing process is discarded.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In addition, waste material is generated during the manufacturing process that is contaminated by small quantities of PMR-15 resin: prepreg backing material, roll cores, kit bags, autoclave debulking materials and other process materials.
      <br/>
      Personal safety items such as shop coats, gloves, booties, and dust masks add to the disposal problem.
      <br/>
      Currently these materials are commonly disposed of together either through carefully controlled incineration or by being packed in a drum and shipped to a special hazardous material landfill.
      <br/>
      These methods of disposal are costly, and the material in the landfill remains indefinitely the responsibility of the generator.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      There have been other attempts to circumvent the problems caused by the toxicity of MDA.
      <br/>
      These range from imidizing the PMR-15, so that the MDA is fully reacted before the product is sold to the composite manufacturer and thus harmless, to changing the chemical composition of the PMR-15 formulation.
      <br/>
      In fact, most ofthe investigations to date have been motivated by scientists measuring the effects of chemical composition on polymer properties, rather than by considerations of safety.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      One example is NASA Langley's LARC-160 which is similar to PMR-15 with the exception that the MDA is replaced with a commercial diamine mixture (Jeffamine).
      <br/>
      This is said to improve the flow, tack, and drape, but at the expense of glass transition temperature and thermal oxidative stability.
      <br/>
      Cycom X3009 contains excessive amounts of the so-called bis-nadimnide, the condensation product of MDA and two nadic esters.
      <br/>
      This makes the material difficult to process and causes excessive micro-cracking on thermal cycling of the composites made from this product.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      CPI 2320 from SP Systems, Inc., is based on RP46, and is described as an MDA-free PMR polyimide that is both safe and cost-effective as a replacement for PMR-15.
      <br/>
      However, the thermal stability of CPI 2320 at 316 (degree)  C. and 1.03 Mpa air pressure is almost an order of magnitude poorer than that of PMR-15.
      <br/>
      SP Systems compared the stability of RP46 on T650-35 graphite fiber against PMR-15 on G30-500 graphite fiber and found similar results with poor thermal stability.
      <br/>
      In addition, subsequent toxicity testing completed by NASA-Lewis Research Center has suggested that the diamine in RP46 is also a potential carcinogen.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Many diamines lacking benzylic hydrogen do not make a stable PMR resin.
      <br/>
      The only (non-fluorinated) resins made with the usual benzophenonetetracarboxylic dimethyl ester that are comparable to PMR-15 in stability have been made with 1,1-bis(4-aminophenyl)-1-phenyl ethane.
      <br/>
      However, this diamine is an  ALPHA -substituted MDA, and therefore can be expected to be relatively toxic and mutagenic.
      <br/>
      Most diamines chemically related to MDA (as well as MDA itself) give positive Ames tests for mutagenicity and the degree of mutagenicity can vary by orders of magnitude between diamines.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Currently, researchers at NASA-Lewis have developed a polyimide resin called AMB-21 which replaces MDA with 2,2-bis(4-�4-aminophenoxyl�phenyl)propane (BAPP), a non-toxic, non-carcinogenic monomer.
      <br/>
      AMB-21 has further benefit in that it may be formed into composite components by using resin transfer molding (RTM).
      <br/>
      RTM fabrication techniques fall into the category of "low-cost" composite processing, since RTM can cut the manufacturing costs by up to 50%.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, AMB-21 has a glass transition temperature (after post-cure) of only 285 (degree)  C., which also falls short of the PMR-15 goal to achieve a 316 (degree)  C. composite use-temperature.
    </p>

      The invention further encompasses a method of enhancing the glass transition temperature (Tg) of a polyimide, the polyimide being formed from a mixture of monomeric reactants including at least one dianhydride or a derivative thereof and at least one diamine or a derivative thereof.
      <br/>
      The monomeric reactants have a total amount of diamine, and the method includes increasing the molar ratio of a phenylenediamine to the total amount of diamine, thereby enhancing the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polyimide.

      The present invention offers several benefits and advantages as noted briefly above, including, for example, low toxicity, a high glass transition temperature, excellent thermal oxidative stability, and desirable processing characteristics.
      <br/>
      In further detail, virtually all of the polyimide systems of the invention have a thermal glass transition temperature (Tg) of at least 245 degrees Celsius, with many of the systems having a thermal glass transition temperature (Tg) of at least 316 degrees Celsius.
      <br/>
      Moreover, numerous systems show excellent thermal oxidative stability (TOS), losing less than ten percent by weight under conditions of 316 degrees Celsius and 125 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) air pressure for a period of 125 hours, while several other systems lose less than three percent by weight under these same, severe testing conditions.
      <br/>
      These and other benefits and advantages will become readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon a review of the Drawings and a reading the Detailed Description presented below.

    <p num="29">The entire disclosure of Provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60/071,599 entitled "Safe Polyimides for Manufacturing of High Temperature Component", filed on Jan. 16, 1998, is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.</p>
    <p num="30">
      As noted briefly above, the present invention is directed to polyimide systems which simultaneously offer low toxicity, a high glass transition temperature, excellent thermal oxidative stability, and desirable processing characteristics.
      <br/>
      These various polyimide systems include mixtures of monomeric reactants, polyimide-precursor reaction products, polyimides, and polyimide-containing articles.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The mixtures of monomeric reactants include at least one dianhydride or a derivative thereof, and at least one diamine or a derivative thereof, while the polyimide-precursor reaction products include a polyamic acid or a derivative thereof, formed by a reaction of the monomeric reactants.
      <br/>
      As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, any suitable dianhydride, diamine, or derivative thereof may be used in forming the polyimide systems of the present invention, in addition to those explicitly named herein.
      <br/>
      By way of example, numerous dianhydrides and diamines are disclosed in Harris et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,397,847, Griffin et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,177,180, Mueller et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,784, and Vora U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,737, the entire disclosure of each of these patents being hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As used herein, the term "derivative" includes any isomer of the dianhydride, diamine, or polyamic acid to which the term refers.
      <br/>
      In addition, with respect to dianhydrides, "derivative" includes a tetracarboxylic acid, a tetraester, a monoacid/triester, a triacid/monoester, and a diacid/diester.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The polyimide systems of the invention may be created in any of a number of different physical forms, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill.
      <br/>
      The monomeric reactant mixtures typically are in solution, in which case suitable solvents and co-solvents may be used, as appropriate.
      <br/>
      For example, any alcohol or combination of alcohols may be used, with methanol being particularly advantageous.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, as understood by persons of ordinary skill, high-boiling, aprotic solvents are beneficial when making powders.
      <br/>
      Non-limiting examples of such solvents include NMP, DMSO, m-cresol, pyridine, THF, DMF, xylene, and diglyme, with NMP being especially beneficial.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Any of the polyimide systems of the invention may incorporate one or more end-capping agents.
      <br/>
      As will be understood by one of ordinary skill, if cross-linking is desired, then a reactive agent may be used.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if cross-linking is not desired, then a non-reactive agent may be used.
      <br/>
      Non-limiting examples of reactive agents include nadic ester and PEPA, while aniline and phthalic anhydride (and its acids/esters) are non-limiting examples of a non-reactive end-capping agent.

    <p num="45">Polyimide Systems Made by Combining BAPP with PDA</p>
    <p num="46">Co-polymers were made by combining the BAPP diamine with isomers of phenylenediamine (PDA) in combination with the BTDA dianhydride or by partial replacement of the BTDA dianhydride with biphenyl dianhydride (BPDA).</p>
    <p num="47">
      Both uni-tape and 8-harness satin graphite reinforced laminates were fabricated in an autoclave and tested for Tg (by Thermal Mechnaical Analysis, TMA) and TOS (Table II).
      <br/>
      Several of the polyimide resin solutions were also successfully resin-transfer molded into 2"-diameter, braided, composite tubes with low void contents.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The chemical "backbone" of the BAPP diamine was considered to be high in molecular weight and fairly "flexible." In order to increase Tg, BAPP was partially replaced with more rigid diamines at several molar levels.
      <br/>
      By utilizing a low-molecular-weight, rigid diamine in the polymer formulation, the calculated molecular weight of the polyimide oligomer was reduced from the original 2100.
      <br/>
      Four new formulations were synthesized by combining the BAPP diamine with isomers of phenylenediamine (PDA) at the following levels: 10, 20, 30, and 40 mole % (AMB-20XL, AMB-19XL, AMB-18XL, and AMB-17XL, respectively).
      <br/>
      In addition, biphenyl dianhydride (BPDA) was studied as a Tg and TOS enhancer.
      <br/>
      One formulation was synthesized by replacing 50 mole % of the BTDA with BPDA (AMB-17XLB).
      <br/>
      A total of five formulations resulted, and the TOS (at 316 (degree)  C., 1024 hrs.) and Tg data can be found in Table II.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      From the data in Table II, the AMB-18XL formulation was considered to have the best overall thermal performance.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it became apparent from the data that PPDA and mixtures of PPDA/MPDA could be used to enhance the Tg and TOS of these polymeric solutions.

      N-methylpyrrilidinone (NMP) was used as a cosolvent, in addition to methanol and acetone, in order to maintain the solubility of the fairly large molecular weight diamines (56% methanol30% NMP/14% acetone by weight).
      <br/>
      These solutions have been stable in the freezer (without precipitation) for over twelve months.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      These resin systems were compression molded into braided composite bushings and autoclaved into carbon fiber reinforced laminates.
      <br/>
      A typical autoclave cure cycle for producing composite laminates is as follows: 1.7 (degree)  C./min up to 163 (degree)  C. and hold for one hour with 15 inches of vacuum, 1.7 (degree)  C./min up to 218 (degree)  C. and hold for one our using full vacuum, 2.8 (degree)  C./min up to 232 (degree)  C. where 200 psi pressure is applied, and then increase temperatuer up to 316 (degree)  C. with a final two hour hold before cooling to room temperature.
      <br/>
      A similar cycle, without vacuum, can be used for compression molding.
      <br/>
      A subsequent ten-hour post-cure at 316 (degree)  C. was conducted in an air re-circulating oven.
      <br/>
      The glass transition temperature (Tg) was then measured by TMA followed by thermal oxidative stability testing at New Hampshire Ball Bearing and Cincinnati Test Laboratories.
      <br/>
      The results are summarized in Table III.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The Tg range for all ten resin systems (before post-cure) was 247 (degree)  C. to 291 (degree)  C. Since the lower molecular weight (n=2) resins were formulated with larger amounts of the nadic crosslinker, these systems were expected to produce higher Tg values than their comparable n=3 counterparts.
      <br/>
      This was not always the case as shown by the BAX, BIP, and BIAP resin systems.
      <br/>
      The AXAP and BAX candidates did conform to this generalization.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Once the "as-molded" Tg data was obtained, the post-cure cycle was designed by using the lowest Tg after molding because all of the bushing were post-cured in a single batch.
      <br/>
      Since the low Tg was determined to be 476 (degree)  F. (247 (degree)  C.), the first 2 hour post-cure hold was started at 25 (degree)  below that temperatuer, or 450 (degree)  F. (232 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The post-cure continued with 2 hour holds every 30 (degree)  up to 600 (degree)  F. (316 (degree)  C.) where a 10 hour final hold was employed.

    <p num="58">The results show that at least six of the experimental resin candidates exhibited +316 (degree)  C. Tg values.</p>
    <p num="59">
      In addition to Tg determination, the variable stator vane bushing candidates were subjected to thermal oxidative stability (TOS) testing at both NHBB and Cincinnati Testing Laboratories (CTL).
      <br/>
      All of the laminates were subjected to the CTL "bomb" test with the bushing samples even though only two (BIP-19 and BIP-25) of the ten experimental resins produced low-void panels (i.e., produced good c-scans at NASA LeRC) during autoclave molding.
      <br/>
      At least two post-cured bushing samples and one laminate from each resin system were supplied for the "bomb" test, which utilizes high-pressure air to accelerate oxidation.
      <br/>
      This TOS test was first designed by GE Aircraft Engines (GEAE) in an attempt to simulate the harsh conditions that can be found in the different areas of a jet engine.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      At NHBB, this TOS test consisted of 100 hours of thermal exposure at 600 (degree)  F. (316 (degree)  C.) under 70 psia air pressure.
      <br/>
      At CTL, the test consisted of 100 hours of thermal exposure at 600 (degree)  F. (316 (degree)  C.) under 125 psia air pressure.
      <br/>
      Both facilities used five volume changes of air in the sample chamber each hour of exposure.
      <br/>
      The bushing and laminate weight loss data for the ten candidate resin systems is shown in Table III.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The TOS data outlined in Table III show that the weight loss data for the laminates were more fovorable than the data for the bushings.
      <br/>
      However, it should be noted that NHBB utilized a cure cycle for the bushing samples that had been previously "optimized" for production hardware and not these resin systems.
      <br/>
      In addition, the consolidation pressure for the experimental bushings was applied extremely late in the manufacturing process �e.g., +540 (degree)  F. (282 (degree)  C.)�, so there was a good chance that cyclopentadiene gas evolved in appreciable quantities, thereby limiting the NE crosslinking reaction.
      <br/>
      This scenario would be especially true for BIP-19 where the final consolidation pressure was applied as late as 600 (degree)  F. (316 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The laminate's consolidation pressure, on the other hand, was applied early in the cure cycle of cyclopentadiene evolution.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      A possible explanation for the thermal performance of the experimental variable stator vane bushings may be a very open, or porous, braided carbon fiber structure, whereas the panels utilized a tight 8-harness cloth as the reinforcement.
      <br/>
      The affects on weight loss could be dramatic.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      Even with the differences in weight loss between the bushings and laminates, several general conclusions may be drawn concerning the experimental resin systems.
      <br/>
      First of all, the overall ranking or order of the weight-loss data from low to high remained consistent from one facility to the other.
      <br/>
      In addition, the bushings with the highest weight loss were fabricated with copolyimides containing the "BAPP" diamine (e.g., BIAP-20, BIAP-26, AXAP-19, and AXAP-25).
      <br/>
      Those systems formulated with GAX (BAX-17 and -23), BIS-P (BIP-19 and -25), or both (BIAX-18 and -24) had lower weight loss when compared to the "BAPP" materials.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      This data set provided the exciting discovery that both polyimides formulated with the BIS-P diamine (BIP-19 and BIP-25) achieved excellent thermal oxidative stability results (only 1.3% weight loss).
      <br/>
      This was a major accomplishment in developing non-toxic, high-temperature polyimide resin systems.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      In summary, the results obtained on variable stator vane bushings and flat composite panels indicate that a "family" of high-temperature polyimides have been developed which have both a=31 6 (degree)  C. glass transition temperature and excellent thermal stability.
      <br/>
      The laminate weight loss datga also reiterates that BIS-P and BIS-P copolymers have great potential as commercially viable high-temperature composite systems.

    <p num="66">Polyimide Systems Utilizing BIS-P and BIS-M</p>
    <p num="67">
      A matrix of polyirnide copolymers was synthesized by using Bisaniline-P, Bisaniline-M, and paraphenylenediamine (PPDA).
      <br/>
      Partial molar substitutions of PPDA (up to 50 mole percent) were used in order to increase glass transition temperatuer and/or thermal oxidative stability.
      <br/>
      Pre-polymer molecular weight was also adjusted to favorably impact processing parameters as well as the final Tg.
      <br/>
      Each copolymer was formulated at a molar ratio of 2 NE: 2 BTDE: 3 Diamine.
      <br/>
      All of the resin systems were synthesized using standard techniques known in the industry.
      <br/>
      In some of the BIS-P formulations, n-methylpyrrilidinone (NMP) was used as a solvent in addition to methanol.
      <br/>
      This was done in order to maintain the solubility of the fairly large molecular-weight BIS-P diamine.
      <br/>
      NMP was not needed in the BIS-M formulations since this diamine was readily soluble in methanol.

      The Tg results in Table V conclusively show that paraphenylenediamine (PPDA) can be used as a Tg "enhancer" in polyiride formulations.
      <br/>
      In both the BIS-P and BIS-M containing copolyimides, the Tg increased as the molar percent substitution of PPDA increased.
      <br/>
      This further verified the results achieved in the BAPP/PPDA co-polymer work discussed above.
      <br/>
      This is due to the stiffening of the polymer chain with a highly aromatic monomer such as PPDA.
      <br/>
      Five of the formulations outlined in Table V have Tg's greater than 316 (degree)  C., and two of the BIS-P formulations (BIP-15.5 and BIP-15) actually produced Tg's over 340 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The TOS test results were also extremely encouraging, since six out of the ten formulations produced into laminates had weight4oss values less than 3%.
      <br/>
      The composite tubes produced by the RTM process displayed somewhat higher weight-loss values than the laminates.
      <br/>
      This may have been due to non-optimized cure cycles which were used for the RTM process.
      <br/>
      Another possible explanation may be due to the actual fiber architecture of the tubular component.
      <br/>
      The RTM tubes contained a very open, or porous, braided, carbon-fiber structure, whereas, the panels utilized a tight, 8-harness cloth as the reinforcement.
      <br/>
      These subtle fiber differences may have a dramatic difference on the weight loss of the composite sample.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The compression data found in Table V is also encouraging.
      <br/>
      Three of the candidates (BIP-19, BIM-16 and BIM-15.5) had a compression-strength over 50 ksi.
      <br/>
      This is significant in light of the fact that the testing was performed at elevated temperature (288 (degree)  C.) after the laminates had been TOS tested at 316 (degree)  C. Four of the systems with lower compression-strength (BIP-19, BIP-17, BIM-19, and BIM-17) were tested above their Tg's.
      <br/>
      It is expected that these results would be improved if the testing was repeated at a temperature below the Tg's.
      <br/>
      In addition, the laminates used for the testing were all fabricated using a single autoclave run which was not optimized for the individual systems.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The results obtained on braided tubes and flat, composite panels indicate that a "family" of high-temperature polyimides have been developed which have both a high glass-transition-temperature (+316 (degree)  C.) and excellent thermal stability at 316 (degree)  C. The laminate weight loss data also reveal that both BIS-P and BIS-M formulations (with partial molar substitutions of PPDA) have great potential in low-toxicity, high-temperature, composite applications.
      <br/>
      Many other companies and government agencies have tried to achieve these results without success.
      <br/>
      We believe this is the first time that both the glass transition and thermal stability requirements have been simultaneously met with a cost-competitive, non-MDA resin system.

    <p num="75">
      This technology can also be applied to other MDA-containing systems such as bismaleimides and epoxies.

      Since MDA-containing plastics are utilized in almost every industry, effective MDA substitutes allow a dramatic reduction in environmental health costs and disposal costs, thereby helping U.S. businesses to remain competitive in global markets.

      Many potential applications will arise, for example, in the automotive, chemical and aerospace industries.

      In Table VIII, the two polyimide samples (BPM-2 and BPM-3) have a total weight-loss of about 6.7% up to 300 (degree)  C. By reviewing the actual TGA curves, this initial weight-loss occurs just after 200 (degree)  C. Since the reaction solvent (NMP) boils at 202 (degree)  C., it is suspected that the early weight-loss corresponds to residual NMP solvent left over after the oven-drying operation.
      <br/>
      These findings are also consistent with the initial weight-losses (up to 350 (degree)  C.) that were measured for the polyimide powders listed in Table IX.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Also shown in Table VIII is the total weight-loss (%) measured at 400 (degree)  C. The "control" 5250-4 BMI reveals a 36% weight-loss, while the worst-case polyimide oligomer powder (BPM-2) is only 17%.
      <br/>
      The results also suggest that n=3 (higher molecular weight) oligomers may have a slight TOS advantage over the n=2 versions.
      <br/>
      This could be a realistic trend since the nadic crosslink is considered by most to be the weak link.
      <br/>
      Higher molecular-weight oligomers may have an advantage with respect to TOS and toughness, but generally at the expense of processing and lower Tg.

      Another indication of TOS can be found in the "maximum peak ( (degree)  C.) in the TGA derivative curve." This peak represents the point at which the TGA weight-loss curve has reached its largest slope downward (the point of maximum weight-loss--i.e., the decomposition temperature). 5250-4 BMI actually has two very strong decomposition peaks that average to approximately 416 (degree)  C. As shown in Table VIII, the polyimide samples are at least 50 (degree)  C. above this average.
      <br/>
      Overall, it would appear that the two polyimide powders made with biphenyl dianhydride offer somewhat better thermal oxidative stability compared to the BMI.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      Table IX summarizes the thermal stability of several different polyimide resins that used different dianhydrides but the same diamine (BIS-P).
      <br/>
      When the dianhydride was substituted from biphenyl dianhydride to pyromellitic dianhydride, the total weight-loss at 450 (degree)  C. changed from 22-24% to 32%.
      <br/>
      Although PMDA has a cost advantage, it appears that BPDA has the thermal performance.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      All of the polyimides listed in Table IX have decomposition temperatures in excess of 500 (degree)  C., which exceeds that of the baseline BMI resin system.
      <br/>
      Once again, the initial weight-loss in Table IX that occurs between 200 (degree)  C. and 350 (degree)  C. is believed to be due to residual NMP solvent. (Note: Some NMP (1-2%) may be useful for promoting flow during RTM processing.)

      For example, crosslinking systems such as phenylethynylphthalicanhydride (PEPA) may offer a polymer with enhanced thermal stability over the NA version; the major drawback with PEPA is the current high cost of $900/lb.

    <p num="91">
      The six formulations found in Table II were synthesized in a round bottom, three-neck, 2 L glass reactor equipped with a mechanical agitator, inert nitrogen purge, thermometer, condenser, and an electric heating mantle coupled with a digital controller.
      <br/>
      The synthesis procedure began by placing the required amount of BTDA anhydride powder in the reactor.
      <br/>
      Next, approximately half of the method solvent volume was added to the reactor at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The other portion of the methanol solvent was placed in a wash bottle and saved for later use in the synthesis procedure.
      <br/>
      Then, the reactor agitator was turned on along with the inert nitrogen purge and the water to the condenser.
      <br/>
      The temperature controller was then set at 125 (degree)  C. in order to heat the solution to reflux.
      <br/>
      On average the solution took 15-30 minutes to reach reflux conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Within 50-65 minutes after the methanol addition, or 25-45 minutes from the start or reflux, the solution turned to clear yellow, which indicated ester formation.
      <br/>
      At this point a portion of the remaining methanol solvent was used to wash in residual BTDA from the stir rod, thermometer, and sides of the reactor.
      <br/>
      If the reflux temperature was above 64 (degree)  C., the controller temperature set point was decreased to 100 (degree)  C. The reflux was then allowed to continue for 1.0 hours, thus completing the BTDA esterfication reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      To reduce the temperature for the diamine addition, the controller was then set at 50 (degree)  C. Cooling to 45-50 (degree)  C. normally took 25-40 minutes.
      <br/>
      The diamines, BAPP along with paraphenylenediamine (PPDA), were then mixed together and added through a neck of the reactor.
      <br/>
      During the addition of the diamines, agitation was continued and approximately 250 mL of methanol were used to wash in the residual diamine powder.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      The solution was then heated to a 45-50 (degree)  C. reflux with an initial set point of 65 (degree)  C. The solution was allowed to sit for 1.5 additional hours.
      <br/>
      At the end of the 1.5 hour hold, the solution was cooled for the nadic monomethyl ester (NON-EXCLUSIVE) addition by setting the temperature controller to 19 (degree)  C., applying a fan, and eventually removing the mantle.
      <br/>
      The time to cool down to 31 (degree)  C.-36 (degree)  C. was 55-75 minutes in duration.
      <br/>
      Before the NE was added to the solution, it was crushed using a beaker to remove large "clumps" and to produce mostly fine particles.
      <br/>
      The remainder of methanol wash was used to rinse residual NE into the reactor.
      <br/>
      The NE was given 1.5 hours at ambient temperature (27 (degree) -36 (degree)  C.) to mix. Solution density, viscosity, and weight percent solids were measured immediately after the resin was collected.

    <p num="108">Detailed Synthesis Procedure for AMB-20XL Solution</p>
    <p num="109">
      The synthesis of the AMB-20XL resin system began with adding BTDA powder (141.77 grams, 0.440 moles) into a 2 liter, 3-necked glass reactor equipped with a mechanical agitator, inert nitrogen purge, thermometer, condenser, and an electric heating mantle coupled with a digital controller.
      <br/>
      Next, methanol solvent (215 ml, 5.307 moles) was measured in a graduated cylinder and poured into the reactor.
      <br/>
      Once the methanol was added to the reactor, agitation was begun, an inert nitrogen sweep was started, and water flow to the condenser was initiated.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      The temperature controller was then set to 110 (degree)  C. to heat the solution to reflux.
      <br/>
      After 20-30 minutes, the reaction temperature reached 64 (degree)  C. and began to reflux.
      <br/>
      After 40 minutes, the system turned to a clear, amber solution, which indicated the esterfication of the anhydride.
      <br/>
      At this point, any residual BTDA that splashed up the sides of the reactor was rinsed into solution by using a trace amount of methanol.
      <br/>
      The solution was then allowed to reflux for another 1-1.5 hour to complete the esterfication reaction.
      <br/>
      At the end of the old, the controller temperature was set to 19 (degree)  C., and the solution was allowed to cool for approximately 15-20 minutes.
      <br/>
      While the reaction solution was cooling, 86.33 grams (0.440 moles) of the NE endcap were weighed into a plastic container.
      <br/>
      Once the solution reached 45-50 (degree)  C., the NE was added to the reactor and completely washed in with 109 ml (2.690 moles) of methanol.
      <br/>
      The solution was allowed to mix for at least 1 hour without heat.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      Next, 243.84 gram (0.594 moles) of BAPP and 7.14 gram (0.066 moles) of PPDA were weighed out and mixed together. (this represents a 10% molar substitution of BAPP with PPDA.) The diamines were added to the reactor at 33 (degree)  C. and washed in with 275 ml (3.745 mole) of acetone solvent.
      <br/>
      The solution was allowed to mix for two hours without heat.

      In addition, a larger amount of methanol (437 ml, 10.786 moles) was initially added to the reactor in order to snythesize a 35 weight percent ester solution (instead of 50%) from BTDA and BPDA.

      <br/>
      Next, approximately 170 ml of methanol solven (4.196 moles) was measured in a graduated cylinder and poured into the reactor in such a manner as to wash in any residual BTDA monomer.

      After stirring for one hour, 125 ml (1.290 moles) of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) were added as a co-solvent to the mixture to help force the BIS-P diamine into solution.
      <br/>
      After stirring for one more hour, another 25 ml of NMP were added at a reaction temperature of 57 (degree)  C. Almost immediately the BIS-P diamine particles went into solution, and the temperature set point was lowered to 19 (degree)  C. in order to cool the solution down to room temperature for the endcap addition.

    <p num="129">
      After approximately 10-15 minutes at the lower temperature set point, the heating mantle was removed and a fan was applied to aid in cooling the reactor.

    <p num="153">
      The synthesis of the BIP-16 system began with the anhydride addition to the reactor.
      <br/>
      The BTDA powder (305.90 grams, 0.949 moles) was placed in a 2 liter, 3-necked reactor.
      <br/>
      Next, approximately one half of the required methanol solvent (590 ml, 14.562 moles) was measured in a graduated cylinder.
      <br/>
      The 590 ml were poured into the reactor, while the remaining 500 ml (12.341 moles) were stored in a solvent wash bottle.
      <br/>
      Once the methanol was added to the reactor, agitation was begun, an inert nitrogen sweep was started, and water flow to the condenser was initiated.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      The temperature controller was then set to 135 (degree)  C. to heat the solution to reflux conditions.
      <br/>
      After 20 minutes, the reaction temperature reached 64 (degree)  C. and reflux began.
      <br/>
      The controller was then set to 115 (degree)  C. to maintain the reflux.
      <br/>
      After 35 minutes, the system turned to a clear, yellow solution.
      <br/>
      At this point any residual BTDA was rinsed into solution using the methanol wash.
      <br/>
      The temperature set point was decreased again to 100 (degree)  C. and the solution was allowed to reflux for 1.5 hours more.
      <br/>
      At the end of the reflux hold, the controller temperature was set to 19 (degree)  C. to cool.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      Once the system had cooled for 20 minutes to a temperature of 56 (degree)  C., agitation was ceased and the heating mantle was turned off.
      <br/>
      The solution was allowed to sit overnight with a nitrogen purge on to prevent air from entering the reaction set-up.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      The next morning, the temperature set point was increased to 95 (degree)  C. and agitation was resumed along with water flow to the condenser.
      <br/>
      While the reaction was heating, 343.40 grams (0.997 moles) of bisaniline-P (BIS-P) and 46.20 grams (0.427 moles) of paraphenylenediamine (PPDA) were weighed out and mixed together.
      <br/>
      After 20 minutes of heating, the reaction temperature had reached 50 (degree)  C. so the temperature set point was lowered to 60 (degree)  C. to prevent from reaching methanol's boiling point (65 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      Finally, the diamines were added through a funnel.
      <br/>
      The remainder of the methanol wash was required to rinse in the entire diamine residue.
      <br/>
      The solution became a yellow/orange slurry upon the diamine addition.
      <br/>
      The temperature controller was then set again to 135 (degree)  C. to promote reflux.

    <p num="157">
      After 20 minutes at that temperature set, the reaction temperature rose to 63 (degree)  C. and reflux began.

      The controller set was lowered to 115 (degree)  C. to maintain the reflux temperature.
      <br/>
      After 2.25 hours of reflux, the solution was examined and it was found that there were particles not in solution. N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) (22.40 grams, 0.232 moles, 2.5 weight percent solvent) was added to force the insoluble particles into solution.
      <br/>
      Almost immediately the particles went into solution and the temperature set was lowered to 19 (degree)  C. to cool the solution for the endcap addition.

    <p num="158">
      After approximately 15 minutes at the lower temperature set, the heating mantle was removed and a fan was applied to aid in cooling the reactor.

      <br/>
      After 60 minutes the reaction had cooled to 31 (degree)  C., 186.30 grams (0.949 moles) of NE were added to the solution with agitation.
      <br/>
      A minimal amount of additional methanol was used to wash in the residual NE powder.

    <p num="195">
      The general synthesis procedure for producing polyimide powders included reacting the dianhydride with the diamine (25% monomer solids) for two hours in a suitable reactor at 55 (degree)  C., using n-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) as the solvent.
      <br/>
      Once the short-chain poly(amic-acid) was formed, the nadic anhydride end-cap was added and allowed to react for one additional hour.
      <br/>
      Next, the entire mixture was heated to 180 (degree)  C. for two hours in order to thermally imidize the poly(amic-acid).
      <br/>
      Condensation by-products were removed and collected in a Dean-Stark trap in order to force the imidization reaction to completion.
      <br/>
      The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, which usually resulted in viscous slurry.
    </p>
    <p num="196">
      Precipitation of the polyimide oligomers from the slurry was tried with limited success by using the following non-solvents: acetone, hexane, methanol, toluene, and water.
      <br/>
      Since the precipitation experiments did not produce a clear favorite, inexpensive water was used as the non-solvent for all formulations.
      <br/>
      Following precipitation of the oligomers, the slurries were filtered and dried in an air re-circulating oven before being ground into powder.

    <p num="199">
      A similar reactor set-up to the ester solution's was employed for the powder synthesis procedure, except that a Dean-Stark Trap was used to connect the condenser to the reactor.
      <br/>
      The Dean-Stark Trap was needed to collect condensate during the polymerization.
      <br/>
      A Claisen adapter was used to incorporate the thermometer and the nitrogen sweep inlet.
      <br/>
      Before beginning the reaction, all glassware was assembled and flamed to remove moisture.
    </p>
    <p num="200">
      The synthesis started with the addition of n-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent to the reactor at room temperature.
      <br/>
      A total solvent volume of 620 ml (6.400 moles) was needed so 300 ml (3.097 moles) were placed in the reactor, while 320 ml (3.303 moles) were poured into a solvent wash bottle for later use in the synthesis.
      <br/>
      Upon the solvent addition to the reactor, the temperature controller's set point was increased to 100 (degree)  C. The solvent was allowed to heat for 30 minutes to a temperature of 59 (degree)  C. To maintain the temperature, the set point was reduced to 60 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="201">
      With the temperature above 55 (degree)  C., the diamnine was added to the reactor.

      The required amount of Bisaniline-P (BIS-P) was 99.17 grams (0.288 moles).

      After the 63.94 grams (0.144 moles) of 6FDA were added slowly to the solution, another 1/3 of the solvent wash was used to rinse in all anhydride residue.
      <br/>
      The addition of the anhydride resulted in an exothermic reaction that increased the reaction temperature from 53 (degree)  C. to 68 (degree)  C. After several minutes, the temperature leveled off to 65 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="203">
      The resin system was then cooled for 2.0 hours by setting the controller to 50 (degree)  C. At the end of the hold, the reaction temperature was 45 (degree)  C., a suitable temperature for the endcap addition.

      Therefore, 47.26 grams (0.288 moles) of 5-norbornene 2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride (NA) were added to the reactor and rinsed with the remaining portion of wash solvent.

    <p num="270">
      A similar reactor set-up to the ester solution's was employed for the powder synthesis procedure, except that a Dean-Stark Trap was used to connect the condenser to the reactor.
      <br/>
      The Dean-Stark Trap was needed to collect condensate during the polymerization.
      <br/>
      A Claisen adapter was used to incorporate the thermometer and the nitrogen sweep inlet.
      <br/>
      Before beginning the reaction, all glassware was assembled and flamed to remove moisture.
    </p>
    <p num="271">
      The synthesis started with the addition of n-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent to the reactor at room temperature.
      <br/>
      A total solvent volume of 1148.4 ml (11.886 moles) was needed so 800 ml (8.280 moles) were placed in the reactor, while 350 ml (3.622 moles) were poured into a solvent wash bottle for later use in the synthesis.
      <br/>
      Upon the solvent addition to the reactor, the temperature controller's set point was increased to 50 (degree)  C. The solvent was allowed to heat for 10 minutes to a temperature of 25 (degree)  C. To maintain the heating of the solution, the set point was raised to 60 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="272">
      When the temperature exceeded 40 (degree)  C., the diamines were added to the reactor.
      <br/>
      The required amount of Bisaniline-P (BIS-P) was 68.20 grams (0.198 moles), while 21.40 grams (0.062 moles) of paraphenylenediamine (PPDA) were added.
      <br/>
      Approximately 1/2 of the solvent wash volume was used to rinse in the diamine residue from the funnel and sides of the reactor.
    </p>
    <p num="273">
      Immediately following the completion of the diamine addition, the anhydride was added.
      <br/>
      After the 117.70 grams (0.400 moles) of biphenyldianhydride (BPDA) were added slowly to the solution, the remaining solvent wash was used to rinse in all anhydride residue.
      <br/>
      The addition of the anhydride resulted in an exothermic reaction that increased the reaction temperature from 46 (degree)  C. to 61 (degree)  C. After several minutes, the temperature leveled off to 55 (degree)  C. and was held for 2.0 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="274">
      The resin system was then cooled by setting the controller to 19 (degree)  C. At the end of the day, the reaction temperature was 52 (degree)  C., a suitable temperature to shut down the system for an overnight hold.
      <br/>
      The inert nitrogen purge was continued overnight to prevent air and moisture from contaminating the reaction mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="275">
      The following morning, the solution temperature was 18 (degree)  C. Agitation was resumed before the heating mantle was turned back on and the controller was set to 180 (degree)  C. To prevent convective heat loss, insulation was placed around all exposed surfaces of the reactor except for the graduated cylinder side of the Dean-Stark Trap.
      <br/>
      After 15 minutes of heating, the reaction temperature had reached 42 (degree)  C. and the set point was increased to 225 (degree)  C. The solution reached 72 (degree)  C. after 5 minutes at the higher set point.
      <br/>
      The set point was raised again to 275 (degree)  C., then 310 (degree)  C. Reflux occurred at 183 (degree)  C. five minutes later.
      <br/>
      The temperature set point was reduced to 280 (degree)  C., and the solution was held at reflux for 2.0 hours.
      <br/>
      The initial volume of condensate drained from the Dean-Stark Trap was 19.5 ml. The solution had turned to a "tang" orange color.
    </p>
    <p num="276">
      During the reflux hold, the temperature was held at 185 (degree)  C. by reducing the temperature set point to 250 (degree)  C. At the end of 2.0 hours, the set point was reduced to 19 (degree)  C. The system was poured into a glass dish 15 minutes later at a temperature of 171 (degree)  C. The solution gelled immediately after being poured so 1500 ml (83.264 moles) of water were used to rinse the reactor of residue.
      <br/>
      The total condensate volume collected once the reactor had cooled was 47.4 ml. The system resembled a bright yellow, rubber like slurry.
    </p>
    <p num="277">
      The polyimide slurry was then vacuum filtered using a large Buchner funnel, suction filtration flask, and vacuum pump.
      <br/>
      To thoroughly wash the slurry of solvent, extensive measures were taken.
      <br/>
      First of all, 2 teaspoons of slurry were placed in a blender with 300 ml (16.653 moles) of water and blended.
      <br/>
      After pouring the blender's contents into the funnel, an additional 1.0 L (55.509 moles) of water was used to wash the blender and the filtered powder.
      <br/>
      The filtered powder was very granular and light yellow in color.
    </p>
    <p num="278">
      The powder was transferred from the Buchner funnel into another glass dish and placed in an air-recirculating oven to dry.
      <br/>
      The oven was gradually ramped up to 200 (degree)  C. and then held at that temperature for 4 hours.
      <br/>
      The dried powder was then ground and placed in a plastic bag.
      <br/>
      Approximately 192 grams of polyimide powder were recovered.
      <br/>
      The polyimide powder was either resin transfer molded into carbon fiber reinforced composites, or compression molded into neat resin specimens.
