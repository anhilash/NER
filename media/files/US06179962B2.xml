      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a new process for improving paper strength and more particularly it relates to the use of combinations of oxidized galactose containing polymer and cationic polymers in the papermaking process.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">

      <br/>
      Germino disclosed the use of the oxidized products in the manufacture of paper.
      <br/>
      The aldehyde bearing oxidized products were disclosed to be also suitable for use to crosslink polyamino polymers, polyhdroxy polymers, and proteins.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">According to the present invention, there is provided a process for making paper having improved strength characteristics by providing pulp and adding thereto (1) cationic polymer and (2) oxidized galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer wherein the alcohol has been oxidized to aldehyde, and sheeting and drying the paper, provided that when the oxidized galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer is oxidized guar it is selected from the group consisting of oxidized neutral guar, oxidized anionic guar and oxidized amphoteric guar.</p>
    <p num="7">Further according to the present invention there are provided paper products having improved strength characteristics prepared by using the combination of cationic polymers and oxidized galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymers.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">It has surprisingly been discovered that oxidized galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymers such as neutral, anionic and/or amphoteric oxidized guar, in combination with water-soluble or water-dispersible cationic polymers give significant strength improvement over the unoxidized or oxidized guars alone.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The treatment of oxidizable galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer with galactose oxidase and catalase is the subject of companion application Ser.

      No. 09/001,789, filed Dec. 31, 1997, entitled "Oxidation in Solid State of Oxidizable Galactose Type Alcohol Configuration Containing Polymers" by R. L. Brady, R. T. Leiffried and T. T. Nguyen, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The oxidizable galactose alcohol type of configuration can be described by the following chemical structures:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="11">where;</p>
    <p num="12">
      R1=an alkyl group of the formula C(n)H(2n+1) where n=0-20;
      <br/>
      z=0,1;
      <br/>
      R2=a linking group composed of an alkylene, or an aromatic alkylene, or an alkylene ether, or an alkylene ester, or an alkylene amide, or an alkylene urethane diradical.
      <br/>
      Such linking groups have a total number of carbon from 2 to 20;
      <br/>
      R3=--H, --OH, --OCH3, --OC2H5, --OC3H7, --OC4H9, --OOCR5 (where R5=alkyl radical of 1 to 5 carbons), --NH2, --NH--CO--R5;
      <br/>
      and y=0,1.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The oxidizable galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymers can be galactomannan gums or their ether derivatives, arabinogalactan gums or their ether derivatives, other gums or their ether derivatives, galactoglucomannan hemicelluloses or their ether derivatives and synthetically or enzymatically modified polymers.
      <br/>
      Preferred galactomannan gums are guar, locust bean, tara and fenugreek.
      <br/>
      Preferred arabinogalactan gums are arabic, larch and tragacanth gums.
      <br/>
      Preferred synthetically or enzymatically modified polymers are galactose deficient polysaccharides, polyacrylamides, polyacrylates, polyamides, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinyl acetate.
      <br/>
      Most preferred such polymers are starch and polyacrylates.
      <br/>
      The phrase "galactose deficient" as used in the present application means that the oxidizable galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer it refers to contains less than 20% of oxidizable galactose alcohol configuration based on the weight of the oxidizable galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer.
      <br/>
      Preferred other gums are carubin, lichenan, tamarind and potato galactan.
      <br/>
      Most preferred oxidizable galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymers are guar gum and its ether derivatives such as anionic, amphoteric, hydroxypropyl, dihydroxypropyl and hydroxyethyl guar.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Synthetically or enzymatically modified polymers can be obtained by transferring an oxidizable galactose alcohol type of configuration to polymers.
      <br/>
      Glycosyl transferases or hydrolases can be used to transfer galactose from lactose unto e.g., polysaccharides to provide useful polymers for oxidation.
      <br/>
      Synthetic methods can also be used to attach the oxidizable galactose alcohol type of configuration.
      <br/>
      By these methods, other oxidizable saccharides such as gulose, fructose, sorbose, mannose, talose, xylose and ribose may be attached to polymers providing candidates for oxidation.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The oxidized galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer component of the present invention has at least about 5 mole % of its oxidizable galactose type of alcohol configuration oxidized to aldehyde.
      <br/>
      Preferably, at least about 25 mole % and most preferably at least about 50 mole % of such alcohol has been oxidized to aldehyde.
      <br/>
      The oxidizable galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer used for oxidation can range over a wide molecular weight range.
      <br/>
      It can be high molecular weight, or alternatively it can be a depolymerized (reduced viscosity) polymer.
      <br/>
      Generally, the lower limit of the weight average molecular weight of the oxidizable galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer can be about 5,000.
      <br/>
      The upper limit of the weight average molecular weight of the oxidizable galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer can be about 5,000,000.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the molecular weight range as indicated by room temperature Brookfield viscosity is at least about 15 cps at 2 weight percent solution in water, most preferably, at least about 100 cps at 1 weight percent solution in water.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the room temperature Brookfield viscosity can be up to about 10,000 cps, and most preferably up to about 6,000 cps. at 1 weight percent solution in water (Measured in Brookfield LVT viscometer with small sample adapter, 25 (degree)  C., spindle 31, speed 3 rpm).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Oxidized guar is preferred as the oxidized galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer for use in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The present application refers to oxidized guar specifically in certain instances, however, the person of ordinary skill in art will recognize that these teachings apply to the oxidized galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer in general.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The oxidizable galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer can be oxidized in solid form, in slurry form or in solution.
      <br/>
      The oxidation can be carried out chemically or enzymatically by galactose oxidase.
      <br/>
      Preferably neutral or anionic or amphoeteric guar that has been oxidized by galactose oxidase and catalase is used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      Galactose oxidase can be applied to solid, slurry, or solution forms of guar products: e.g., shredded, powder, flake, and pellet forms of neutral, anionic or amphoteric guar.
      <br/>
      Guar derivatives, such as those containing hydroxypropyl groups can also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Galactose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.9) is a copper oxidase which converts the oxidizable galactose type of alcohol configuration to the corresponding aldehyde group (thus producing oxidized galactose) by reducing oxygen to hydrogen peroxide.
      <br/>
      The copper must be in the correct oxidation state (Cu2+) to perform this oxidation and the copper ion must be retained in the galactose oxidase.
      <br/>
      If the galactose oxidase solution is stored anaerobically with any oxidizable substrate, it can become inactive.
      <br/>
      Galactose oxidase can be reactivated by oxidizing the copper with reagents such as potassium ferricyanide.
      <br/>
      Another way to oxidize the copper in galactose oxidase would be by electrochemical oxidation.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Galactose oxidase can be obtained by any suitable manner, e.g., by fermenting various wild type and cloned fungi but is usually obtained from Fusarium spp (NRRL 2903).
      <br/>
      Cultures may also be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection under Dactylium dendroides ATCC 46032 and they are successfully fermented under the procedure of Tressel and Kosman.
      <br/>
      Methods in Enzymology, Vol 89 (1982), pg 163-172.
      <br/>
      The gene for active forms of the enzyme have been expressed in E. coli and Aspergillus and this development may lead to more stable and active forms of the enzyme as well as much greater production levels.
      <br/>
      The gene or improved forms will also be expressed in plants which can be harvested to give higher levels of enzyme without the threat of enzyme destruction by proteases in a fermentation broth.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The enzyme can also be expressed by other organisms including: Gibberella fujikoroi, Fusarium graminearum, and Bettraniella porticensis.</p>
    <p num="21">
      The oxidation by galactose oxidase is often carried out in the presence of the catalase.
      <br/>
      The amount of catalase can be at least about 1 unit of catalase/unit of galactose oxidase.
      <br/>
      Catalase can be present in an amount of up to about 10,000 units of catalase/unit of galactose oxidase.
      <br/>
      The catalase destroys the hydrogen peroxide formed from the galactose oxidase reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Increased levels of oxidation and corresponding increase in paper strength characteristics is the subject of companion application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/001,785 filed Dec. 31, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,022,717, entitled "Oxidation in Solid State of Oxidizable Galactose Type Alcohol Configuration Containing Polymers" by R. L. Brady and R. T. Leiffried, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Preferably the oxidation promoting chemical is organic carboxylate compound, organic heterocyclic compound, chlorinated organic compound and/or quaternary amine compound.
      <br/>
      Most preferably the organic carboxylate compound is sorbic acid, benzoic acid, toluic acid, phthalic acid and their corresponding salts, the organic heterocyclic compound is 1,2-benzisothiazoline-3-one, and/or 2-methyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one, the chlorinated organic compound is 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, and quaternary amine compound is cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and/or epoxy quaternary amines.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Cationic polymers suitable for use in combination with oxidized galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer in the present invention are water-soluble and/or water-dispersible cationic polymers.
      <br/>
      The phrase "water-soluble" as used in the present application means a polymer of which at least about 5% by weight dissolves in water at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The phrase "water-dispersible" as used in the present application means a polymer that can be evenly distributed in water and if it settles out it can be readily redispersed.
      <br/>
      By cationic is meant anything with a net positive charge at papermaking pH's (e.g., pH of about 3 to about 10).
      <br/>
      This includes amphoteric polymers containing both anionic and cationic sites which polymers have a net cationic charge.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Preferably the cationic polymer is polymeric amine-epichlorohydrin resin, such as polyamide-epichlorohydrin (PAE) resin, polyalkylenepolyamine-epichlorohydrin (PAPAE) resin, and amine polymer-epichlorohydrin (APE) resin, in which amine polymer-epichlorohydrin resin the amine groups have been alkylated with epichlorohydrin to produce a polyamine-epichlorohydrin resin that has azetidinium or epoxide functionality; cationic derivative of polysaccharides (such as starch, guar, cellulose, and chitin; polyamine; polyethyleneimine; vinylalcohol-vinylamine copolymers; cationic acrylic homo- and copolymers such as polyacrylamide, polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride and copolymers of acrylic acid, acrylic esters and acrylamide with diallyldimethylammonium chloride, acryloyloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride, methacryloyloxyethyltrimethylammonium methylsulfate, methacryloyloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride and methacrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride.
      <br/>
      Cationic polymers are described in more detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,318,669 and 5,338,406, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Most preferably the cationic polymer is cationic starch, cationic guar, polyamidoamine-epichlorohydrin resin and/or polyacrylamide.
      <br/>
      The effectiveness of the cationic polymers is particularly evident when used with oxidized anionic guar.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The total weight of oxidized galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer (oxidized polymer) plus cationic polymer is generally at least about 0.05%, preferably at least about 0.1% and most preferably at least about 0.15%, based on the dry weight of the paper.
      <br/>
      The total weight of oxidized polymer plus cationic polymer is generally up to about 5%, preferably up to about 1% and most preferably up to about 0.5%, based on the dry weight of the paper.
      <br/>
      The weight ratio of oxidized polymer to cationic polymer can generally be at least about 1:20, preferably at least about 1:4 and most preferably at least about 1:1.
      <br/>
      The weight ratio of oxidized polymer to cationic polymer can generally be up to about 100:1, preferably up to about 50:1 and most preferably up to about 20:1.
      <br/>
      The optimum ratio of oxidized polymer to cationic polymer would depend on the oxidized polymer used, the cationic polymer used and the type of furnish (i.e., pulp, pH, fillers, etc.) used.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The components of this invention--the cationic polymer and the oxidized galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer--can be added anywhere in the process of papermaking, i.e., either before or after sheet formation.
      <br/>
      For example, they can be added before sheet formation (1) early during pulp preparation in the slurry chest or refiner chest, (2) in the machine chest or stock chest, (3) at other points in the wet end such as the fan pump or in-line mixers.
      <br/>
      They can also be added to the white water chest.
      <br/>
      Examples of addition after sheet formation are in the size press or even as a later coating process.
      <br/>
      The components can be premixed or added separately in any order.
      <br/>
      Preferable practice in the wet end, however, is to add the cationic polymer first.
    </p>
    <p num="29">In addition to dry strength, properties such as Z-direction tensile strength, Scott Bond Strength, Mullen burst, ring crush, tensile energy absorption (TEA) and fracture toughness can also be improved by using the combination of cationic water-soluble and/or water-dispersible polymers and oxidized galactose type of alcohol configuration containing polymer of the present invention.</p>

      For the examples, handsheets were made on a Noble and Wood Sheet Machine (Noble and Wood Machine Co., Hoosick Falls, N.Y.) using standard hard water at a controlled pH of 7.5. Standard hard water (50 ppm alkalinity and 100 ppm hardness) was made by mixing deionized water with CaCl2 and NaHCO3.
      <br/>
      Control of pH was achieved by using NaOH or H2 SO4.
      <br/>
      Bleached kraft pulp was beaten to a Canadian Standard Freeness of 455 at a consistency of 2.5 weight %. The beaten pulp was added to the proportioner at a controlled level (depending on final desired basis weight) and diluted to 18 liters with standard hard water.
      <br/>
      For 80 lb/3000 ft2 basis weight, 4000 ml of pulp mixture was used.
      <br/>
      Chemical additions and pH adjustments were made to the proportioner as desired, and with continuous mixing.
      <br/>
      For the examples with multiple additives, the cationic additive was always added first.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      A clean and wetted 100 mesh screen was placed on the open deckle box, which was then closed.
      <br/>
      Standard hard water and 920 ml of pulp mixture from the proportioner were then added to the deckle box, and dashed.
      <br/>
      The water was then drained from the box, and the sheet removed.
      <br/>
      The sheet was wet pressed between felts with press weights adjusted to give a solids content of 33-34%.
      <br/>
      The sheet and screen were then placed on a drum dryer, which was adjusted to a temperature of 228-232 (degree)  F. and throughput time of 50-100 sec, depending on basis weight.
      <br/>
      Final sheet moisture contents were 3-5%.
