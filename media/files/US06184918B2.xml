      A method for monitoring viewing of broadcast data includes detecting a lead tag corresponding to a program in the broadcast data.
      <br/>
      The broadcast data is monitored for a tail tag corresponding to the program.
      <br/>
      Whether the program was viewed in its entirety is determined by matching the lead tag with the tail tag.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to the field of entertainment systems.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for monitoring the viewing of broadcast data on an entertainment system.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Television has become the key element in the advertising program for many companies.
      <br/>
      Billions of dollars are invested in communicating a product message to the viewing audience.
      <br/>
      Advertisers who spend such huge sums of money understandably want to determine whether their money is being well spent and, if not, how improvements can be made.
      <br/>
      Feedback to assess whether an advertising campaign is working is desired.
      <br/>
      Information such as was a targeted portion of the public exposed to the campaign as planned and did the public find the advertisement favorable is valuable to the advertisers.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Various techniques are currently available to provide information of this nature.
      <br/>
      However, each of these suffers from various drawbacks.
      <br/>
      One of the earliest techniques involved conducting interviews with television viewers to determine their exposure to a particular advertisement and whether they had a favorable impression of the advertisement.
      <br/>
      This approach, however, required finding television viewers willing to participate in sometimes long surveys at inconvenient times.
      <br/>
      In addition, results obtained with this technique were suspect because of the heavy reliance on memory, and on the viewer's inclination to be biased in favor of what is of interest to the interviewer.
      <br/>
      Current audience measurement systems eliminate the need for participating in surveys at inconvenient times and the element of bias, but require participating households to have their television sets and video playback devices to be disassembled and hard-wired with viewing monitoring circuitry.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="4">
      A method for monitoring viewing of broadcast data according to an embodiment of the present invention is disclosed.
      <br/>
      A lead tag corresponding to a program in the broadcast data is detected.
      <br/>
      The broadcast data is monitored for a tail tag corresponding to the program.
      <br/>
      Whether the program was viewed in its entirety is determined by matching the lead tag with the tail tag.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating system components of an entertainment system 100 according to one embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The entertainment system includes a common input/output (I/O) bus 110 that connects the system components in the entertainment system 100 together.
      <br/>

      According to an embodiment of the present invention, the broadcast data analyzer 340 monitors the broadcast data for program identification tags in the broadcast data.
      <br/>
      According to one embodiment of the present invention, a program identification tag is a message encoded in the vertical blanking interval (VBI) of analog broadcast data.
      <br/>
      According to a second embodiment of the present invention, a program identification tag is a message encoded in a program in digital broadcast data.
      <br/>
      The encoded message may be graphical, text, or other format and may include a name of a program, a code that corresponds to a name of a program, or other information corresponding to the program.
      <br/>
      The broadcast data analyzer 340 may include a VBI analyzer and a digital broadcast analyzer to monitor the broadcast data for the program identification tags.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      More than one program identification tag may be encoded in a program.

      For example, a "lead tag" may be encoded in the beginning of a program that identifies the beginning of a program and a "tail tag" may be encoded at the end of a program to identify the end of a program.
      <br/>
      Upon detecting a lead tag and a matching tail tag of a first program without detecting a tag that corresponds to a second program in between the lead tag and tail tag of the first program, the broadcast data analyzer 340 recognizes that a user of the entertainment system 100 has viewed the first program in its entirety.
      <br/>
      Upon detecting a lead tag of a first program and a tag corresponding to a second program after the lead tag of the first program, the broadcast data analyzer 340 recognizes that a user of the entertainment system 100 viewed the beginning of the first program, but did not view the end of the first program.

      In an embodiment of the present invention where "intermediate" program identification tags are encoded between a lead tag and a tail tag throughout a program, the broadcast data analyzer 340 would be able to determine the segment of the program where the user of the entertainment system 100 stopped viewing the program to the increment of time where the intermediate tags are encoded.
      <br/>
      Information regarding whether a program identification tag is lead tag, a tail tag, or an intermediate tag, and whether the program identification tag corresponds to a first program or a second program may be obtained by the broadcast data analyzer 340 at the program reference unit 350.
