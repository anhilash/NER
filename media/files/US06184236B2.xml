      Detailed Description of the Invention It has now surprisingly been found that compounds of the present invention are NMDA(N-methyl-D-aspartate)-receptor subtype selective blockers, which have a key function in modulating neuronal activity and plasticity.
      <br/>
      These therepeutic properties make the compounds of formula I and their salts key players in mediating processes underlying development of CNS as well as learning and memory formation.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Under pathological conditions of acute and chronic forms of neurodegeneration, overactivation of NMDA receptors is a key event for triggering neuronal cell death.
      <br/>
      NMDA receptors are composed of members from two subunit families, namely NR-1 (8 different splice variants) and NR-2 (A to D) originating from different genes.
      <br/>
      Members from the two subunit families show a distinct distribution in different brain areas.
      <br/>
      Heteromeric combinations of NR-1 members with different NR-2 subunits result in NMDA receptors displaying different pharmaceutical properties.
      <br/>
      Possible therapeutic indications for NMDA receptor subtype specific blockers include acute forms of neurodegeneration caused, e.g., by stroke and brain trauma, and chronic forms of neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), neurodegeneration associated with bacterial sclerosis and neurodegeneration associated with bacterial or viral infections.
