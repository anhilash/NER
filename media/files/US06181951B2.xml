      <br/>
      An adapter/converter circuit converts transmissions by a mobile telephone built for one standard (e.g., PCS) from the telephone transmit/base station receive frequency of that one standard to the telephone transmit/base station receive frequency of another standard (e.g., cellular), and converts transmissions by a base station or similar device (e.g., a base station simulator) from the telephone receive/base station transmit frequency of the one standard to the telephone receive/base station transmit frequency of the other standard.
      <br/>
      The two frequency conversions occur simultaneously on two parallel legs under the control of a PLL dual frequency synthesizer, which is in turn controlled by user input (in the case where the adapter is used to allow, e.g., PCS telephones to be tested on cellular test equipment) or by the base station (in the case where the adapter is used to allow, e.g., PCS telephones to be used with a cellular base station).

    <p num="1">
      This is a division of copending, commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/990,852, filed Dec. 15, 1997.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to a standards converter for allowing a mobile telephone which communicates on a first mobile telephony standard to interface with a base unit which communicates on a second mobile telephony standard.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to a converter that allows a mobile telephone that operates at PCS frequencies to interface with a base unit that operates at cellular telephone frequencies.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Different mobile telephone standards are currently in use.
      <br/>
      Mobile telephones communicate with base stations in a full-duplex mode in which each channel uses two different frequencies so that each mobile telephone can transmit to the base station and receive from the base station at the same time.
      <br/>
      This is important because all control of any telephone call is accomplished by the base station, so that even when a user is transmitting, the base station must be able to send control information to the mobile telephone (e.g., if the telephone is in motion, the base station must be able to instruct the telephone to change channels as it is handed off to another base station).
      <br/>
      Under the standard (as used herein, the term "standard" refers to the agreed-upon frequencies at which a system operates, and not to other "standards" such as those that govern how speech is encoded, etc.) for one type of mobile telephone system known as "cellular," each mobile telephone transmits at any one of a number of frequencies between about 824.01 MHz and about 848.97 MHz and receives at any one of a number of frequencies between about 869.01 MHz and about 893.97 MHz (the individual frequencies within those bands are separated by about 30 kHz).
      <br/>
      Under the standard for another type of mobile telephone system known as "PCS" (for "Personal Communications Service"), each mobile telephone transmits at any one of a number of frequencies between about 1850.01 MHz and about 1909.95 MHz and receives at any one of a number of frequencies between about 1930.05 MHz and about 1989.99 MHz.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Base stations for mobile telephone systems are generally manufactured for one standard.
      <br/>
      Similarly, testing equipment, such as that used to test mobile telephones as they are manufactured or are being repaired, typically is provided for testing mobile telephones under only one standard.
      <br/>
      In the mobile telephone manufacturing and repair context in particular, this requires mobile telephone manufacturing and repair facilities to have a different testing device for each type of mobile telephone that it manufactures or repairs.
      <br/>
      And because a mobile telephone base station can operate on only one standard, a mobile telephone service provider who provides service under more than one standard must purchase and maintain a variety of different types of base station equipment for the different standards.
    </p>
    <p num="5">It would be desirable to be able to provide a converter that would allow equipment designed for one mobile telephone standard to be used with mobile telephones designed for a different mobile telephone standard.</p>
    <p num="6">It would also be desirable to be able to provide an adapter that would allow testing equipment for one type of mobile telephone to be used to test a different type of mobile telephone.</p>
    <p num="7">It would further be desirable to be able to provide an adapter that would allow a base station for one type of mobile telephone to be used with a different type of mobile telephone.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">It is an object of this invention to provide a converter that would allow equipment designed for one mobile telephone standard to be used with mobile telephones designed for a different mobile telephone standard.</p>
    <p num="9">It is also an object of this invention to provide an adapter that would allow testing equipment for one type of mobile telephone to be used to test a different type of mobile telephone.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      In accordance with the present invention, testing equipment designed to test cellular mobile telephones can be used to test PCS mobile telephones.
      <br/>
      Similarly, base station equipment designed to communicate with cellular mobile telephones can be used to communicate with PCS mobile telephones.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, PCS base station or testing equipment can be used with cellular mobile telephones, or equipment for any other combinations of standards can be used together.
      <br/>
      This allows manufacturers and/or service providers to buy only one type of equipment.
    </p>
    <p num="15">The mixing of equipment designed for different standards is made possible by an adapter/converter circuit that converts transmissions by a mobile telephone built for one standard from the telephone transmit/base station receive frequency of that one standard to the telephone transmit/base station receive frequency of another standard, and that converts transmissions by a base station or similar device (e.g., a base station simulator) from the telephone receive/base station transmit frequency of the one standard to the telephone receive/base station transmit frequency of the other standard.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Preferably, the telephone transmit/base station receive and telephone receive/base station transmit frequency conversions are carried out simultaneously in two parallel circuit legs.
      <br/>
      Each leg achieves the necessary up-conversion or down-conversion by mixing the incoming transmission with an appropriate local oscillator frequency for the desired conversion.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the local oscillator for each leg includes a voltage controlled oscillator ("VCO") controlled by the output of a phase-lock loop ("PLL") circuit, with suitable feedback of the VCO output to the PLL circuit.
      <br/>
      A temperature compensated crystal oscillator preferably provides an accurate reference for the PLL.
      <br/>
      Preferably also, one dual PLL circuit, which provides two outputs based on two respective inputs (to which the feedback from each respective VCO is applied), but requires only a single crystal standard, is used in place of two separate PLL circuits.
      <br/>
      However, separate PLL circuits may be provided instead, if appropriate or desired.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Because the telephone and base station or simulator may operate at any one of a number of frequencies within the appropriate frequency range, the frequency conversion circuits must be capable of adjustment, rather than being calibrated to a single frequency each.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the frequency selectivity is accomplished by providing a control input (or inputs) to the PLL circuit (or circuits) which can vary the VCO output.
      <br/>
      In the case of an adapter for a base station simulator, the PLL control input is preferably controlled by a personal computer or similar input device, which a user can operate to select desired frequency (or on which a testing program could be run which automatically selects frequencies for testing purposes).
      <br/>
      In the case of an adapter for a base station, the PLL control input would preferably be controlled by the base station control system, insofar as the required frequencies change in real time to reflect actual conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 1-3 which are directed to preferred embodiments for use of PCS mobile telephones with cellular base station equipment.</p>
