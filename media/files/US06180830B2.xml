      The present invention relates to a new process for the preparation of a bimetallic ruthenium/tin catalyst.
      <br/>
      The process for the preparation of a bimetallic ruthenium/tin catalyst according to the invention is characterised by the fact that it consists in carrying out the reduction of a ruthenium complex having an electrovalency of -4 and a coordination number of 6, the ligands being either a halogen atom or an anion or a tin halide.
      <br/>
      The catalyst is further employed for the preparation of aldehydes by reduction, in the vapor phase, of carboxylic acids, esters and anhydrides.

  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">This application is an application under 35 U.S.C. Section 371 of International Application Number PCT/FR96/01762, filed on Nov. 08, 1996.</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a new process for the preparation of a bimetallic ruthenium/tin catalyst.</p>
    <p num="3">EP-A-0 539 274 described a process for the preparation of aldehydes and derivatives thereof according to a process which consists in carrying out the reduction, in the vapour phase in the presence of hydrogen, of carboxylic acids, esters or anhydrides, in the presence of a bimetallic ruthenium/tin catalyst.</p>
    <p num="4">Although catalysts of the ruthenium/tin type containing boron are suitable for performing the process described, the catalysts of particular interest are boron-free bimetallic catalysts containing tin and ruthenium, which contain ruthenium and tin used in such quantities that the molar ratio of tin/ruthenium is at least 2, preferably between 2 and 10 inclusive and even more preferably between 2 and 6 inclusive.</p>
    <p num="5">It is possible to use different types of catalysts which may or may not be supported.</p>
    <p num="6">Generally speaking, ruthenium represents between 0.1 and 50% of the weight of the catalyst.</p>
    <p num="7">If a solid catalyst is used, the ruthenium represents 10% to 50% of the weight of the catalyst.</p>
    <p num="8">
      In a preferred embodiment, however, a catalyst in the supported form is used.
      <br/>
      To this end, the support may be chosen in particular from metal oxides such as aluminium, silicon and/or zirconium oxides, or from carbons optionally activated by a well known treatment with nitric acid, acetylene black, or resins.
    </p>
    <p num="9">If the catalytic phase is deposited on a support, the ruthenium content of the catalyst is advantageously between 0.1 and 20.0% by weight, and even more preferably between 0.5 and 3.0% by weight.</p>
    <p num="10">A method of preparing said catalysts described in EP-A-0 539 274 consists in mixing ruthenium III chloride and tin II chloride then adding the solid support.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The disadvantage of this process is that it does not make it possible to obtain a perfectly homogeneous catalyst that can be produced on an industrial scale.
      <br/>
      Indeed, tin II chloride partially hydrolyses and precipitates on the surface of the support whereas ruthenium III chloride penetrates the pores of the support.
      <br/>
      As a result, the support is not impregnated uniformly by the precursors of the ruthenium and tin metals and the catalyst obtained is not very homogeneous.
    </p>
    <p num="12">The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of said catalyst which makes it possible to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages.</p>
    <p num="13">A process has now been found, and this constitutes the subject matter of the present invention, for the preparation of a bimetallic ruthenium/tin catalyst, characterised in that it consists in carrying out the reduction of a ruthenium complex having an electrovalency of -4 and a coordination number of 6, the ligands being either a halogen atom or an anion of tin halide.</p>
    <p num="14">
      According to a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, the reduction of a complex corresponding more particularly to the following formula (A) is carried out:
      <br/>
      �Ru(SnX3)6-n Xn �4-  (A)
    </p>
    <p num="15">in which formula (A) X represents a halogen atom, preferably an atom of chlorine or bromine, and n is a number ranging from 0 to 2, and preferably equal to 1.</p>
    <p num="16">In the process of the invention, the following complexes are used in preference:</p>
    <p num="17">
      �Ru(SnCl3)6 �4-
      <br/>
      �Ru(SnCl3)5 Cl�4-
      <br/>
      �Ru(SnCl3)4 Cl2 �4-
    </p>
    <p num="18">It was found that the catalyst obtained was of good quality if it was prepared according to the process of the invention as specified.</p>
    <p num="19">A halogenated complex of ruthenium and tin corresponding preferably to formula (A) is therefore used in the process of the invention.</p>
    <p num="20">According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the preparation of said complex is carried out by reaction of a ruthenium halide and of a tin halide in the presence of an acid.</p>
    <p num="21">
      To this end, the starting product is a ruthenium III halide, preferably a ruthenium III chloride.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to start with a ruthenium IV salt, but there is no additional advantage, particularly as it is more expensive.
    </p>
    <p num="22">In preference, therefore, a ruthenium III halide, either in the anhydrous or hydrated form, is used.</p>
    <p num="23">
      It is desirable that said compound does not contain too many impurities.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, the compound used is free from heavy metals and has a chemical ruthenium purity of 99% with respect to the other metals.
    </p>
    <p num="24">It is possible to use the commercial form of ruthenium chloride RuCl3 * H2 O containing about 42 to 43% by weight of ruthenium without any disadvantages.</p>
    <p num="25">With regard to the tin salt, a tin halide is used in which the tin has an oxidation number lower than that of the ruthenium.</p>
    <p num="26">A tin II halide is used, preferably a tin II chloride.</p>
    <p num="27">
      It is also possible to use the salt in the anhydrous or hydrated form.
      <br/>
      In preference, the commercial tin salt having the formula SnCl2.2H2 O is also used.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Most often, the halides of said metals are used in the form of an aqueous solution.
      <br/>
      The concentration of these solutions is such that a homogeneous solution capable of being impregnated on a support is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="29">With regard to the quantities of the above-mentioned metal halides used, said quantity is determined in such a way that the ratio between the number of moles of ruthenium halide and the number of moles of tin halide is between 0.10 and 0.5, and preferably between 0.15 and 0.35. It should be noted that the lower limit is not critical because there is no disadvantage in using an excess of tin halide.</p>
    <p num="30">The preparation of the complex by reaction of the ruthenium and tin halides takes place in the presence of an acid, the function of which is to solubilise the tin halide and to keep the complex formed soluble.</p>
    <p num="31">It is possible to use any strong, preferably mineral acid, but it is preferable to use the hydracid of which the halide is identical to the halide used in the ruthenium and tin salts.</p>
    <p num="32">Thus, hydrochloric acid is generally the preferred acid.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The quantity of acid used is preferably at least 1 mole of acid per mole of ruthenium halide, and more particularly between 1 and 5 moles of acid per mole of ruthenium halide.
      <br/>
      The upper limit is not critical and may be exceeded without disadvantage.
      <br/>
      The preferred quantity of acid is in the region of 3 moles of acid per mole of ruthenium halide.
    </p>
    <p num="34">From a practical point of view, the preparation of the complex is carried out by mixing, in any order, the ruthenium halide (preferably ruthenium III chloride), the tin halide (preferably tin II chloride) and the strong acid (preferably hydrochloric acid).</p>
    <p num="35">The reaction mixture is brought to a temperature from 20 (degree)  C. to 100 (degree)  C., preferably between 70 (degree)  C. and 90 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="36">The duration of this operation may vary widely and it may be specified by way of illustration that a period between 1 and 3 hours is perfectly suitable.</p>
    <p num="37">The complex forms fairly rapidly but it remains in solution.</p>
    <p num="38">Afterwards, if necessary, the temperature is restored to ambient temperature, that is, to a temperature most open between 15 (degree)  C. and 25 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="39">It is thus possible to envisage two variants of the process depending on whether the desire is to obtain a catalyst in the solid or supported form.</p>
    <p num="40">In the first case, hydrolysis of the complex obtained is carried out by adding water.</p>
    <p num="41">The amount of water used is not critical; it generally represents 1 to 100 times the weight of the complex.</p>
    <p num="42">After this hydrolysis, the complex precipitates.</p>
    <p num="43">It may be separated by conventional solid/liquid separation techniques, preferably by filtration.</p>
    <p num="44">This separation is generally carried out at ambient temperature.</p>
    <p num="45">The precipitate obtained may optionally be dried then reduced according to the conditions defined below.</p>
    <p num="46">
      If the support is in the form of a powder, such as, for example, alumina or silica, another variant consists in adding it to the solution of the complex obtained, then carrying out hydrolysis as described above, then separating the solid obtained, preferably by filtration, and mixing it and extruding it.
      <br/>
      A formed catalyst is thus obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="47">According to another preferred variant of the process of the invention, the solution of the complex obtained previously is used to impregnate a support.</p>
    <p num="48">The support may take any form, for example, a powder, beads, granules, extrudates, etc.</p>
    <p num="49">With regard to the nature of the support, examples of support are given above such as metal oxides, such as aluminium, silicon and/or zirconium oxides, or active carbons, or resins.</p>
    <p num="50">In the case of a supported catalyst, the ruthenium content is adapted by the man skilled in the art according to the support (nature, specific surface).</p>
    <p num="51">Generally speaking, the ruthenium content of the catalyst is advantageously between 0.1 and 20.0% by weight, and even more preferably between 0.5 and 3.0% by weight.</p>
    <p num="52">From a practical point of view, the metals are deposited on the support by impregnating said support with the solution of the complex obtained according to the process described above.</p>
    <p num="53">The aqueous impregnation solution contains the ruthenium and tin complex in a quantity of 1% to 20% by weight of ruthenium.</p>
    <p num="54">In a practical manner, impregnation may be carried out by spraying the solution containing the ruthenium and tin complex onto the support brought into motion, for example, by the rotation of a rotatable outer ring.</p>
    <p num="55">It is also possible to start with a support resulting from an agglomeration of its particles according to well known methods, for example, of extrusion or pelletising by pressure, then to impregnate the support by immersing it in the solution of said complex.</p>
    <p num="56">
      According to a preferred variant of the invention, impregnation is carried out "in the dry state", that is the total volume of the solution of complex used is approximately equal to the pore volume presented by the support.
      <br/>
      The pore volume may be determined by any known method, particularly according to the mercury porosimeter method (ASTM D 4284-83) or by measuring the quantity of water that a sample will absorb
    </p>
    <p num="57">In the next stage, the impregnated support or the separated precipitate obtained according to the first variant then undergoes a reduction operation.</p>
    <p num="58">A preferred variant of the invention consists in carrying out a drying stage beforehand.</p>
    <p num="59">Drying is most often carried out in the air at a temperature which may range from ambient temperature, for example 20 (degree)  C. to 100 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="60">The drying period is continued until a constant weight is obtained.</p>
    <p num="61">Generally speaking, it ranges from 1 to 24 hours, depending on the temperature chosen.</p>
    <p num="62">In the next stage, the complex is reduced by bringing the solid or supported catalyst into contact with the reducing agent.</p>
    <p num="63">
      It is possible to envisage a chemical reducing agent but this has no specific advantage.
      <br/>
      Thus, reduction is carried out preferably with hydrogen.
    </p>
    <p num="64">Hydrogen may be injected at atmospheric pressure or under a slight pressure, for example 0.5 to 10 bar, preferably between 1 and 2 bar.</p>
    <p num="65">The hydrogen may also be diluted in an inert gas such as nitrogen or helium</p>
    <p num="66">Advantageously, the reduction reaction is carried out at a temperature of at least 350 (degree)  C., preferably between 350 (degree)  C. and 600 (degree)  C., and even more preferably between 400 and 500 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="67">It is understood that reduction may also be carried out during the use of the catalyst if it is used in a reduction reaction of a substrate in the presence of hydrogen.</p>
    <p num="68">Thus, in the process for the preparation of aldehydes and derivatives thereof described in EP-A-0 539 274 according to a process which involves carrying out the reduction, in the vapour phase in the presence of hydrogen, of carboxylic acids, esters or anhydrides in the presence of a bimetallic ruthenium/tin catalyst, said catalyst may be prepared at the start of the reaction, by reduction of a ruthenium and tin complex as defined by the invention.</p>
    <p num="69">The supported catalyst of the ruthenium/tin type thus obtained is particularly homogeneous and may easily be prepared on an industrial scale.</p>
    <p num="70">It contains a metallic phase covering at least in part said support containing at least in part a ruthenium/tin intermetallic phase at least partially in the form of the defined compound of Ru3 Sn7.</p>
    <p num="71">Advantageously, the phase containing the ruthenium and tin has an atomic ratio of Sn/Ru at least equal to 2/3, advantageously 3/2, preferably 7/3.</p>
    <p num="72">Moreover, it is preferable that the atomic ratio Sn/Ru be at most equal to 3, advantageously 5/2.</p>
    <p num="73">In the preferred catalysts, the said phase covering at least in part said support contains at least 50% advantageously 80%, preferably at least 90% of said intermetallic phase.</p>
    <p num="74">Finally, it is desirable that at least 90%, advantageously at least 95%, preferably 98% of the ruthenium present on the support be in the form of said phase covering said support.</p>
    <p num="75">It is very advantageous to use the catalyst obtained according to the invention in the process for the preparation of aldehydes and derivatives described in EP-A-0 539 274 which is incorporated by reference in the present application.</p>
    <p num="76">Indeed, it may be used advantageously to carry out the reduction, by hydrogen, of carboxylic acids, esters or anhydrides in the vapour phase.</p>

    <p num="127">The process of the invention is used in the gaseous phase.</p>

It is understood that the temperature is adjusted by the man skilled in the art depending on the starting acid, and the required rate of reaction.</p>
    <p num="129">
      Moreover, it may be particularly advantageous to activate the catalyst beforehand by means of a very high temperature.
      <br/>
      In particular, the catalyst may be subjected to temperatures close to about 500 (degree)  C. beforehand, and preferably 450 (degree)  C. Activation is advantageously carried out under a stream of hydrogen.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      A practical way of implementing the present invention consists in introducing into a reactor a desired quantity of catalyst, optionally between 2 beds of quartz, in order to promote the contacting of the reagents.
      <br/>
      The temperature of the reactor is then raised under a stream of hydrogen to a determined value, making it possible to activate the catalyst, then brought back to the reaction temperature.
      <br/>
      The acid is then injected at the desired flow rate and the aldehyde formed is recovered.
    </p>
    <p num="131">In preference, the acid is injected directly in the gaseous form after having been vaporised by heating.</p>

    </p>
    <p num="133">
      Under the effect of the high temperature, the acid thus injected is vaporised in the first bed of quartz.
      <br/>
      The hydrogen may be injected at atmospheric pressure or under a slight pressure compatible with the vapour phase (a few bars, for example 0.5 to 10 bar).
      <br/>
      The hydrogen may also be diluted in an inert gas such as nitrogen or helium.
    </p>
    <p num="134">Advantageously, the hydrogen is injected at a flow rate of between 0.1 and 10 litres per hour per 1 ml of catalyst, and the acid at a liquid flow rate at most equal to 10 ml/h, and preferably between 0.5 and 5 ml/h.</p>
    <p num="135">
      At the end of the reaction, the aldehyde is recovered by any suitable means such as distillation or crystallisation.
      <br/>
      In certain cases, particularly in the case of fluoral, the aldehyde may be obtained in the hydrated form.

    <p num="136">The catalyst obtained according to the process of the invention may be used in a process for the preparation of numerous aldehydes which are used as pharmaceutical and/or agrochemical intermediates such as, for example, 3,4-difluorobenzaldehyde, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde.</p>
    <p num="137">It is particularly interesting for the preparation of salicylic aldehyde which may be used, inter alia, for the preparation of coumarine: the latter resulting from a well known cyclisation stage and widely described in the literature (KIRK-OTHMER--Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology 7, p. 198, 3rd edition).</p>

      The present invention may also be used for the synthesis of various aldehydes.
      <br/>
      It may be used to prepare saturated aldehydes such as fluoral or acetaldehyde.

      It is particularly suitable for the synthesis of unsaturated aldehydes, particularly in terpene chemistry (prenal, citral etc.), intermediates in the synthesis of vitamins A or E.

      It will not be beyond the scope of the present invention to produce, according to the process of the invention, aldehydes in the form of their derivatives such as their acetals or their hemiacetals, by reaction of the aldehyde and an alcohol which is introduced either at the same time as the acid or at the end of the reaction.
