      A composition and method for inhibiting apoptosis, or decreasing the rate or extent of apoptosis, in target cells.
      <br/>
      The method comprises the step of the step of contacting the target cells with an apoptosis-regulating amount of at least one cysteine or serine protease inhibitor that:a. inhibits the conversion of the pro-enzyme form of CPP32 to its enzymatically-active form;b. blocks the proteolytic action of activated CPP32 against its cellular substrates; orc. both.The method is particularly applicable to ameliorating the side effects of, or enhancing the selectivity, of photodynamic therapy.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates generally to the field of medicine and pharmacotherapeutics, particularly with the proteolytic events leading to the rapid onset of apoptotic cell death.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the invention is a composition and method for inhibiting or decreasing the extent or rate of apoptosis in a subject, particularly in association with standard photodynamic therapy protocols, which involve administering a photosensitive agent and subsequently irradiating the subject with light of a wavelength that is absorbed by the photosensitive agent.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Photodynamic therapy ("PDT") is an approved cancer treatment that can be used for many purposes, such as the treatment of solid tumors; the impairment of blood-borne targets such as leukemic cells, immunoreactive cells, and unwanted microorganisms; the prevention of restenosis; the treatment of ocular neovascular disorders such as macular degeneration; and the removal of atherosclerotic plaque.
      <br/>
      PDT involves the topical or systemic application of a light-absorbing photosensitive agent, usually a porphyrin derivative, which accumulates selectively in target tissues.
      <br/>
      A particularly potent photosensitizer is benzoporphyrin derivative mono-acid ring A ("BPD-MA" or "verteporfin"), which is a second generation chlorin-type photosensitizer exhibiting distinct advances over its hematoporphyrin forerunners in terms of effectiveness at lower concentrations and ability to absorb longer, more penetrating wavelengths of light.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Upon irradiation with visible light of an activating wavelength, reactive oxygen species are produced in cells containing the photosensitizer, which promotes cell death.
      <br/>
      Evidence has been developed indicating that PDT using a photosensitizer may cause cells to die via an apoptotic pathway.

    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Apoptosis is the term used to describe a type of cellular death that occurs in many tissues as a normal physiological process.
      <br/>
      Apoptosis is a morphologically distinct form of cell death that plays an important role during normal development, differentiation, and homeostasis or turnover of tissues.
      <br/>
      Also called "programmed cell death," this form of cellular demise involves the activation in cells of a built-in genetic program for cell suicide by which cells essentially autodigest.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The goal of apoptosis is to attain an orderly disintegration of cells into structures suitable for phagocytosis.
      <br/>
      Morphologically, apoptosis is begun by loss of contact with neighboring cells and smoothening of the cell surface (vesicle formation on the cell surface and membrane "blebbing").
      <br/>
      It is further characterized by the concentration of the cytoplasm, endonuclease activity-associated chromatin condensation and pyknosis, and segmentation of the nucleus.
      <br/>
      The orderly disintegration of cells also includes the degradation of genomic DNA into nucleosomal fragments and cellular fission to form apoptotic bodies.
      <br/>
      The nucleosome units of the resulting DNA fragments are about 180-200 bases in size.
      <br/>
      The final fragments of apoptotic body cells are phagocytosed by neighboring cells.
      <br/>
      The remnants of these dead cells are then cleared almost without a trace by neighboring phagocytic cells, without resulting in inflammation or scarring.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Apoptosis thus stands in marked contrast to necrotic cell death caused, for example by oxygen-deprivation in myocardial infarction or stroke, where cells lose their energy supplies, rupture and spill their contents into the extracellular milieu.
      <br/>
      Morphologically, necrosis is characterized by marked swelling of mitochondria, swelling of cytoplasm and nuclear alteration, followed by cell destruction and autolysis.
      <br/>
      It occurs passively or incidentally.
      <br/>
      Tissue necrosis is generally caused by physical trauma to cells or a chemical poison.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The concept that apoptosis is a finely regulated process is now well established.
      <br/>
      Kerr et al., "Apoptosis: A Basic Biological Phenomenon with Wide-ranging Implications in Tissue Kinetics", Br. J. Cancer, 26:239-45 (1972).
      <br/>
      However, the precise molecular mechanism remains as yet uncharacterized.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Apoptosis is thus known to be involved in developmental and tissue specific processes that require the removal of cell populations.
      <br/>
      In addition to the normal physiological process where cells are turned over within the body, apoptosis can be induced to occur by cellular, hormonal or other stimuli to remove unwanted cells from the body.
      <br/>
      For example, apoptosis is also known to be involved in the immunological process of cell selection.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the killing of tumor cells and virus-infected cells by the immune system's cytolytic T-cells occurs via apoptosis following target recognition.
      <br/>
      Further, apoptosis accounts for cell death in a wide variety of clinically important areas.
      <br/>
      For example, essentially all chemotherapeutic drugs currently used in the treatment of cancer, as well as x-irradiation in may cases, ultimately kill malignant cells by activating intracellular pathways leading to apoptosis.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Dysregulation of apoptosis, however, may be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of disease states and pathological conditions, such as cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and neurodegenerative disorders.
      <br/>
      Specifically, during spontaneous tumor regression, tumor cell death has been shown to follow an apoptotic pathway.
      <br/>
      During HIV infection, virally induced T-cell death has been shown to follow an apoptotic pathway.
      <br/>
      And the death of neurons that occurs in diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's disease shows many hallmarks of apoptosis.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Control of apoptosis has been shown to be useful with respect to specific cells having crucial relevance to developmental biology.
      <br/>
      Additionally, it would be useful to control apoptosis with respect to treatments involving viral and bacterial pathogens.
      <br/>
      Cancer chemotherapy could also be enhanced by controlling apoptotic pathways.
      <br/>
      Efforts have been made using conventional chemotherapy to treat many of the disease states that result in inappropriate apoptotic cell death, but have so far yielded only minor progress toward effective treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The chemical induction of apoptosis is target cell dependent.
      <br/>
      Glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, have been shown to induce apoptosis in thymocytes.
      <br/>
      Cycloheximide, a known inhibitor of protein synthesis, and actinomycin D, a known inhibitor of mRNA transcription, have also been shown to be powerful inducers of apoptosis in many cell lines.
      <br/>
      Other inducers of apoptosis include UV irradiation, captothecin, aphidocholin, cisplatin, vincristine, and phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin, glucocorticoids, atrophy of hormone-dependent tissues, NK cell, killer cells, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), lymphotoxin (LT), and other cytokines.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The inhibition of apoptosis is also target cell dependent.
      <br/>
      In addition to being classified as apoptosis inducers, actinomycin D and cycloheximide have also been classified as powerful inhibitors of apoptosis in many cell lines.
      <br/>
      Other known apoptosis inhibitors include various endonuclease inhibitors, e.g., Zn2+ and aurintricarboxylic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Inhibition of apoptotic deletion of autoreactive T-cell clones may be achieved by treatment with immunosuppressant cyclosporin A. Other special inhibitors of apoptosis include various steroids and interleukins.
      <br/>
      The latter stage of apoptosis, i.e., the induction of fission events leading to the formation of apoptosis bodies, may be inhibited by the use of microfilament-disrupting agents, such as cytochalasin B and staurosporin.
      <br/>
      Agents that inhibit the expression of the oncogene cMyc or that cause the over-expression of the proto-oncogene bcl-2 can inhibit the induction of apoptosis.
      <br/>
      Calcium ion (Ca+2) chelating agents; hematopoietic system cytokines, such as IL-3, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and granulocyte colony stimulating factor; IL-2; and the bcl-2 gene product have all been reported as being capable of repressing apoptosis.

      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="32">
      "Living cells" in this application refers to either the normal or target cells within a subject.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, the term "living cells" can refer to diseased cells exhibiting an inappropriately high rate or extent of apoptosis.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, "living cells" may also refer to the normal or non-diseased cells surrounding the undesirable cells that are being targeted, such as tumor cells or leukemic cells, in photodynamic therapy or some other form of chemotherapy.
    </p>
    <p num="33">It has been found that the exposure of living cells to certain apoptotic stimuli, such as photodynamic therapy, causes the proteolytic cleavage of certain enzymes, such as the nuclear enzymes CPP32/Yama/Apopain and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase ("PARP"), and certain nuclear associated proteins, such as lamin B1 and the catalytic subunit of DNA dependent protein kinase ("DNA PKCS ").</p>
    <p num="34">
      It has also been found that the protease activity of the thus-cleaved CPP32 can be inhibited with an ICE peptide inhibitor, such as Z-Asp-2,6-dichlorobenzyloxymethylketone ("Z-Asp-DCB"), which completely blocks apoptotic DNA fragmentation.
      <br/>
      The induction of apoptosis can also be blocked by other cysteine protease inhibitors, such as N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide, and by serine protease inhibitors, such as 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and N-tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone ("TLCK").
      <br/>
      While not wishing to be bound by the theory set forth, it is believed that the Z-Asp-DCB may inhibit apoptosis by inhibiting the proteolytic activity of CPP32, while TLCK may suppresses apoptosis by blocking the proteolytic activation of CPP32.
      <br/>
      See FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      However, it does appear more clearly that the cysteine protease CPP32 plays an important role in apoptosis, particularly in PDT-induced apoptosis.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The apoptosis-inhibiting composition of the invention can comprise any cysteine or serine protease inhibitor that:</p>
    <p num="36">
      a. inhibits the conversion of the pro-enzyme form of CPP32 to its enzymatically-active form;
      <br/>
      b. blocks the proteolytic action of activated CPP32 against its cellular substrates; or
      <br/>
      c. both.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Examples of useful cysteine protease inhibitors include those in the interleukin 1 BETA -converting enzyme ("ICE") inhibitors, such as Z-Asp-2,6-dichlorobenzoyloxymethylketone ("Z-Asp-DCB"), Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO ("AC-DEVD-CHL) and the like; N-ethylmaleimide; iodoacetamide; and the like.
      <br/>

      A "photosensitizing agent" is a chemical compound that homes to one or more types of selected target cells and, when exposed to light, absorbs light energy to result in the impairment or destruction of the target cells.

      Preferred are benzoporphyrin derivatives (BPDs) and porfimer sodium.
      <br/>
      Most preferred is the benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A (BPD-MA).

    <p num="62">The precise selection of an appropriate photosensitizer will be affected by such factors as the ability of the compound to localize within the cell, the ability of the compound to influence cell signaling events that link the formation of reactive oxygen species following PDT with the proteolytic events leading to apoptosis, and DNA fragmentation.</p>
    <p num="63">
      The photosensitive agent can be synthesized as a dimer, to absorb more light on a per mole basis.

      The photosensitizing agent also can be conjugated to specific lignads reactive with a target, such as receptor-specific ligands or immunoglobulins or immunospecific portions of immunoglobulins, permitting them to be concentrated in a desired target cell.
      <br/>
      This conjugation may permit lowering of the required dose level, since the material is more selectively targeted, and less is wasted in distribution into other tissues where destruction must be avoided.

      When the live cells are contained within a live, intact animal, the photosensitizing agent is administered locally or systemically.

      When liquid, the photosensitizer formulation can be a suspension or an emulsion.

      In particular, liposomal or lipophilic formulations are most desirable.

      If suspensions or emulsions are used, suitable excipients include water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, and the like.

      The dose of the photosensitizing agent will vary with the target cell(s) sought and the weight and optimal blood level of the animal, when, as preferred the live cells are within an intact animal.
      <br/>
      Depending on the photosensitizing agent used, an equivalent optimal therapeutic level will have to be established.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the dose is calculated to obtain a blood level between about 0.01 and 100  MU g/mL.

      The time between the administration of the photosensitive agent and the administration of inhibitor compound can vary greatly.
      <br/>

      Even more preferably, the radiation wavelength matches the excitation wavelength of the photosensitive compound and has low absorption by the non-target cells and, if in vivo, by the rest of the intact animal, including blood proteins.
      <br/>
      For example, the preferred wavelength for BPD-MA is the range of from about 600 to 900 nm.

      The radiation is further defined in this invention by its intensity, duration, and timing with respect to dosing with the photosensitive agent.

      The intensity must be sufficient for the radiation to reach the desired target cells.
      <br/>
      Both intensity and duration must be limited to avoid overtreating the surrounding normal cells.
      <br/>
      The intensity of radiation at the target cells is preferably between about 2 and 150 mW/cm2.
      <br/>
      The duration of radiation exposure is preferably between about 0.25 minute and 24 hours.

      At three hours following photosensitization, the cells were fixed with 80% ethanol, stained with PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry for DNA fragmentation.
      <br/>
      The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated using single parameter flow cytometric analysis for PI fluorescence.
      <br/>
      The proportion of cells detected within the bar region of FIG. 2 represented cells exhibiting less than 2N DNA.

      However, the other inhibitors and the vehicles not containing inhibitors had no effect on DNA fragmentation, as seen in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      This was surprising because it has been shown that precursors of ICE and CPP32 can be processed by other enzymes, such as GraB and also by ICE itself, in Fas-mediated apoptosis of cytotoxic lymphocytes.

      Yet, the GraB inhibitor peptide (Shi et al., "Purification of Three Cytotoxic Lymphocyte Granule Serine Proteases that Induce Apoptosis Through Distinct Substrate and Target Cell Interactions", J. Exp. Med., 176:1521-29 (1992)), Z-AAD-CMK, had no inhibitory effect on DNA fragmentation.

      Cell pellets were then lysed in 1 mL of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 detergent, 20 mM Tris, pH 8, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol), supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, aprotinin (0.15 U/mL), and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate for 20 minutes on ice.
      <br/>
      Lysates were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 15,800 *  g at 4 (degree)  C. Protein concentrations of the cell extracts were determined by the Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.).

      Cell lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and probed with anti-PARP or anti-CPP32 antibodies.
      <br/>
      Specifically, detergent-soluble proteins (30  MU g) were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10.0% gels under reducing conditions, as described by Laemmli et al., "Cleavage of Structural Proteins During the Assembly of the Head of Bacteriophage T4", Nature, 227:680-85 (1970).

      The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for one hour.

      The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 30 minutes at room temperature with 5% skim milk in PBS.
      <br/>
      The blocked membranes were incubated for 45 minutes using the following antibody concentrations:
      <br/>
      polyclonal goat-anti-PARP (1  MU g/ml),

      <br/>
      Biotinylated molecular weight standards were probed with streptavidin-HRP (1:5000) conjugate (Amersham, Canada) in PBS-0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 30 minutes.

      The membrane was immediately rinsed twice in PBS-T, followed by three 15-minute washes with PBS-T.

      CPP32 was completely cleaved by 15 minutes, as shown in FIG. 3A, while PARP was fully cleaved by 60 minutes post-PDT, as shown in FIG. 3B. In FIG. 3, HL-60 cells were lysed at the indicated times following light treatment.
      <br/>
      Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with polyclonal (A) anti-CPP32 or (B) anti-PARP antibodies.
      <br/>
      Lane 1 shows untreated cells; lane 2 shows BPD-treated cells (without light); and lanes 3-7 show BPD and light (complete PDT)treated cells.
      <br/>
      The results establish that PDT induced the cleavage of CPP32 into its p12 and p17 subunits.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      In contrast, the peptide inhibitor Z-Asp-DCB did not block the cleavage of CPP32, as shown in FIG. 4A. In FIG. 4, HL-60 cells were lysed 60 minutes after light exposure.
      <br/>
      The resulting lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with either polyclonal (A) anti-CPP32 or (B) anti-PARP antibodies.
      <br/>
      Lane 1 shows untreated cells; lane 2 shows BPD-treated cells; lane 3 shows complete PDT-treated cells; and lanes 4-6 show PDT-treated cells treated with Z-AspDCB at concentrations of 50  MU g/mL, 100  MU g/mL or 200  MU g/mL respectively.
      <br/>
      The results showed that the Z-Asp-DCB was able to block the cleavage of PARP, a specific substrate of the CPP32 protease, as shown in FIG. 4B. Significantly, the serine protease inhibitor TLCK blocked the cleavage of CPP32, as well as PARP, as shown in FIG. 5.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      Thus, without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is postulated that PARP cleavage is blocked directly by Z-Asp-DCB and indirectly via the cessation of CPP32 action by TLCK.
      <br/>
      Perhaps the serine protease inhibitor TLCK was able to block apoptosis by interfering with the proteolytic processing of CPP32 by disrupting the activity or processing of an unknown serine protease, as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Following photodynamic treatment of cells containing BPD, reactive oxygen species are rapidly generated.
      <br/>
      Within 15 minutes, the reactive oxygen species may trigger an unidentified target, perhaps an unidentified serine protease.
      <br/>
      This serine protease may then cleave ProCPP32 to convert it to active CPP32.
      <br/>
      TLCK could inhibit this step by directly or indirectly blocking the cleavage of CPP32.
      <br/>
      Upon CPP32 activation, PARP (p116) would be cleaved into 85 kD and 25 kD fragments.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      The nuclear-associated proteins, DNA-PKCS and lamin B1, were also cleaved following PDT.
      <br/>
      However, cleavage of these proteins was disrupted by Z-Asp-DCB, TLCK, or iodoacetamide, as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 6, PDT-treated HL-60 cells were lysed 60 minutes after light exposure.
      <br/>
      The resulting lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with either (A) polyclonal anti-DNA-PKCS or (B) monoclonal anti-lamin B1 antibodies.
      <br/>
      It is possible that DNA-PKCS is also cleaved by CPP32.
      <br/>
      With PARP cleavage, the negative regulation of the Ca++ /Mg++ -dependent endonucleases would be eliminated, and DNA fragmentation would proceed.
      <br/>
      In photodynamically-treated cells, lamin B1 was also cleaved by an ICE-like protease.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The complete cleavage of a protein .about.60-66 kD in cells treated with BPD-MA and light was also detected with the anti-lamin-B1 antibody.
      <br/>
      Cleavage of the .about.60-66 kD protein was not blocked by any of the inhibitors, as shown in FIG. 6B. Lane 1 of FIG. 6 shows untreated cells; lane 2 shows BPD-only treated cells; lane 3 shows PDT-treated cells; lane 4 shows PDT-treated cells that have also been treated with Z-Asp-DCB (200  MU g/mL); lane 5 shows PDT-treated cells treated with TLCK (100  MU g/mL); and lane 6 shows PDT-treated cells treated with iodoacetamide (500  MU g/mL).
