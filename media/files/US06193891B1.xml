      Blood is the fluid that circulates in the blood vessels of the body, that is, the fluid that is circulated through the heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries.
      <br/>
      The function of the blood and the circulation is to service the needs of other tissues: to transport oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, to transport carbon dioxide and various metabolic waste products away, to conduct hormones from one part of the body to another, and in general to maintain an appropriate environment in all tissue fluids for optimal survival and function of the cells.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Guyton, 1991.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Blood consists of a liquid component, plasma, and a solid component, cells and formed elements (e.g., erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets), suspended within it.
      <br/>
      Erythrocytes, or red blood cells account for about 99.9% of the cells suspended in human blood.
      <br/>
      They contain hemoglobin which is involved in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
      <br/>
      Leukocytes, or white blood cells, account for about 0.1% of the cells suspended in human blood.
      <br/>
      They play a role in the body's defense mechanism and repair mechanism, and may be classified as agranular or granular.
      <br/>
      Agranular leukocytes include monocytes and small, medium and large lymphocytes, with small lymphocytes accounting for about 20-25% of the leukocytes in human blood.
      <br/>
      T cells and B cells are important examples of lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      Three classes of granular leukocytes are known, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, with basophils accounting for about 65-75% of the leukocytes in human blood.
      <br/>
      Platelets (i.e., thrombocytes) are not cells but small spindle-shaped or rodlike bodies about 3 microns in length which occur in large numbers in circulating blood.
      <br/>
      Platelets play a major role in clot formation.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Plasma is the liquid component of blood.
      <br/>
      It serves as the primary medium for the transport of materials among cellular, tissue, and organ systems and their various external environments, and it is essential for the maintenance of normal hemostasis.
      <br/>
      One of the most important functions of many of the major tissue and organ systems is to maintain specific components of plasma within acceptable physiological limits.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Plasma is the residual fluid of blood which remains after removal of suspended cells and formed elements.
      <br/>
      Serum is the fluid which is obtained after blood has been allowed to clot and the clot removed.
      <br/>
      Serum and plasma differ primarily in their content of fibrinogen and several components which are removed in the clotting process.
      <br/>
      Plasma may be effectively prevented from clotting by the addition of an anti-coagulant (e.g., sodium citrate, heparin) to permit handling or storage.
      <br/>
      Plasma constitutes about 4% of total body weight in humans.
      <br/>
      It is composed primarily of water (approximately 90%), with approximately 7% proteins, 0.9% inorganic salts, and smaller amounts of carbohydrates, lipids, and organic salts.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Carlson, 1991.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The protein portion of plasma and serum is a mixture of a large number different protein components.
      <br/>
      Standard methods, such as precipitation by various salts or organic compounds, electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and immunoprecipitation with antibody-containing antisera, have been variously employed to identify and characterize at least 100 distinct protein components in human plasma.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Putnam, 1975-1987; Handin et al., 1995. Five major fractions of blood protein (as determined electrophoretically) are albumin,  ALPHA 1-globulin,  ALPHA 2-globulin,  BETA -globulin, and  GAMMA -globulin.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In human blood, approximately one-half of blood protein is albumin, a relatively small protein with molecular weight of 69,000.
      <br/>
      Albumin contributes greatly to the colloid osmotic pressure of plasma and thus plays a major role in the regulation of intravascular volume and the fluid exchange between the vascular system and extravascular system.
      <br/>
      Albumin also serves as a transport protein for various substances, including small ions such as calcium and iodine and organic compounds such as bilirubin.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In human blood, the  ALPHA 1-globulin fraction contains proteins such as  ALPHA 1-acid glycoprotein,  ALPHA 1-antitrypsin, and  ALPHA 1-lipoprotein.
      <br/>
      The  ALPHA 2-globulin fraction contains proteins such as  ALPHA 2-macroglobulin, haptoglobulin, ceruloplasmin, and group-specific complement.
      <br/>
      The  BETA -globulin fraction contains proteins such as transferrin, hemopexin,  BETA 1-lipoprotein,  BETA 2-microglobulin, and complement components.
      <br/>
      The  GAMMA -globulin fraction contains proteins such as immunoglobulins and C-reactive protein.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Immunoglobulins (which are antibodies found circulating in the blood) represent approximately one-sixth of the total human blood protein and largely constitute the  GAMMA -globulin fraction.
      <br/>
      Of the different classes of immunoglobulins which can be distinguished, the principle ones are IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In addition to albumin and immunoglobulins, lipoproteins are another class of blood components and account for approximately 10% of total human blood protein.
      <br/>
      Lipoproteins are water soluble complexes comprising protein components (e.g., apolipoproteins) and lipid components (e.g., cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, phospholipids, and triglycerides).
      <br/>
      Lipoproteins are often conveniently considered to comprise a hydrophobic core (primarily of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides) surrounded by a relatively more hydrophilic shell (primarily apolipoproteins, phospholipids, and unesterified cholesterol) projecting its hydrophilic domains into the aqueous environment.
      <br/>
      Lipoproteins presumably serve as transport proteins for lipids, such as triacylglyercols, cholesterol (and cholesteryl esters), and other lipids (e.g., phospholipids).
      <br/>
      Lipoprotein remnants are the biological byproducts produced in the metabolism of lipoproteins.

      Three classes of lipoproteins,  ALPHA 1-lipoprotein, pre- BETA -lipoprotein, and  BETA 1-lipoprotein, can be distinguished in human blood, according to their electrophoretic behavior.
      <br/>
      However, lipoproteins are more conveniently characterized by their ultracentrifligation behavior in high-salt media, as described by their flotation constants (densities), as follows: chylomicra, less than 1.006; very low density (VLDL), 1.006-1019; low density (LDL), 1.019-1.063; high density (HDL), 1.063-1.21; very high density (VHDL), &gt;1.21. Lipoproteins are often approximately spherical in shape, and range in diameter from about 0.1 micron (for chylomicra) to about 5 nanometers (for VHDL).
      <br/>
      Lipoproteins range in molecular weight from 200 kd to 10,000 kd and from 4 to 95% lipid (the higher the density the lower the lipid content).
      <br/>
      The very low- and low-density fractions appear in the  BETA 1-globulin fraction and the high-density and very high-density fractions appear in the  ALPHA 1-globulin fraction.
      <br/>
      Chylomicra and VLDLs are rich in triglycerides (.about.90% and .about.60% of the total lipid content, respectively), while LDLs are rich in cholesterol (.about.60% of total lipid content) and HDLs are rich in phospholipids (.about.50% of total lipid content).
      <br/>

      Triacylglycerols (also known as triglycerides or neutral fats) are electrically neutral esters of glycerol and which possess acyl groups that are often derived from fatty acids.
      <br/>
      Examples of fatty acids include long-chain fatty acids such as lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid, palmitolic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidoneic acid.
      <br/>
      Cholesterol triglyceride is a triglyceride where one or more acyl group is derived from cholesterol.

    <p num="16">
      Cholesterol, the most abundant steroid in animal tissues, is usually present in blood as a lipid component of a lipoprotein.
      <br/>
      Cholesterol is a biological precursor of five major classes of steroid hormones (the progestagens, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens) which are also usually present in blood as a lipid component of a lipoprotein (i.e., they are also associated with a lipoprotein complex).
      <br/>
      Examples of such steroids include progesterone, cortisol, aldosterone, testosterone, and estrone.
      <br/>
      Cholesteryl esters, such as the apolipoproteins A1, B, C, and E, are examples of other cholesterol derivatives.

      Phospholipids are lipids which comprise phosphorus; often phospholipids also contain nitrogen.
      <br/>
      Examples of phospholipids include those derived from glycerol (i.e., phosphoglycerides), such as phosphatidyl cholines, phosphatidyl ethanolamines, phosphatidyl serines, phosphatidyl inositols, and phosphatidyl glycerols.
      <br/>
      Other examples of phospholipids include those derived from sphingosine (i.e., sphingolipids), such as ceramides and sphingomyelins.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Glycolipids, another class of blood components, are lipids which comprise at least one carbohydrate group (e.g., sugar residue).
      <br/>
      Most glycolipids can be classified as glycosphingolipids (which are derived from sphingosine) or glycoglycerols (which are derived from glycerol).
      <br/>
      Mammalian glycolipids are usually derived from sphingosine.
      <br/>
      Many glycolipids may be further classified as neutral-, sulfo-, or phospho-glycosphingolipids or -glycoglycerols.
      <br/>
      Examples of simple glycosphingolipids include the cerebrosides in which there is only one sugar residue, often glucose, lactose or galactose.
      <br/>
      Examples of more complex glycosphingolipids include the gangliosides, which possess a branched chain of as many as seven sugar residues, as well as hematosides, globosides, and trihexosylceramide.

      A number of blood proteins function as carriers for specific substances and are often referred to as transport proteins.
      <br/>
      These include apolipoproteins, discussed above, which form lipoprotein complexes with lipids, and thus are believed to facilitate the transport of these lipids.
      <br/>
      Other transport proteins include those which transport metal ions, such as the iron-binding protein, transferrin, and the copper-binding protein, ceruloplasmin, and 9.5 S- ALPHA 1-glycoprotein.
      <br/>
      Prealbumin and the thyroxin-binding globulin transport the thyroid hormone, and transcortin transports the steroid hormones.

      Hemoglobin is eliminated from the circulation by haptoglobin, and heme is bound to hemopexin.
      <br/>
      The retinol-binding globulin binds vitamin A. The transcobalamins I, II, and III bind vitamin B12.

      A number of blood proteins are enzymes, pro-enzymes, or enzyme inhibitors.
      <br/>
      Blood proteins which are enzymes (e.g., proteinases) include, for example, cholinesterase, ceruloplasmin, plasminogen, protein C, and  BETA 2-glycoprotein I. Pro-enzymes (i.e., zymogens) are converted to enzymes by the action of specific enzymes.
      <br/>
      Proteinase inhibitors control this process by reducing or eliminating the activity of these specific enzymes.
      <br/>
      The major proteinase inhibitor found in human blood is  ALPHA 1-antitrypsin (i.e.,  ALPHA 1-proteinase inhibitor;  ALPHA 1-trypsin inhibitor, prolastin) which protects tissues from digestion by elastase.
      <br/>
      Another class of proteinase inhibitors found in human blood are the antithrombins, such as antithrombin III, which prevent the effects of thrombin.
      <br/>
      Still another proteinase inhibitor found in human blood is C1-esterase inhibitor, which reduces or eliminates the activity of C1-esterase, which is the activated first component of complement, C1.
      <br/>
      Other blood proteins which are enzyme inhibitors include  ALPHA 1-antichymotrypsin, inter- ALPHA -trypsin inhibitor,  ALPHA 2-macroglobulin, and  ALPHA 2-antiplasmin.

    <p num="21">
      A number of blood proteins are involved with the clotting process (i.e., coagulation factors).
      <br/>
      Blood clots are formed by an enzymatic cascade, with the activated form of one factor catalyzing the activation of the next factor which results in a large amplification and a rapid response to trauma.
      <br/>
      Examples of inactivated and activated clotting factors include, for example, XII and XIIa; XI and XIa; IX and IXa; X and Xa; VII and VIIa; II (prothrombin) and Ia (thrombin); I (fibrinogen) and Ia (fibrin).
      <br/>
      Other clotting factors include kininogen, kallikrein, and factors VIII, VIIIa, V, Va, XIII, and XIIIa.
      <br/>
      A number of clotting factors are also referred to as vitamin K dependent proteins, including, for example, Factor II (prothrombin), Factor VII, Factor IX, Factor X, Protein C, and Protein S.

      A number of blood proteins are complement components and together comprise the complement system, which lyses microorganisms and infected cells by forming holes in their plasma membrane.
      <br/>
      More than 15 complement proteins are known, including C1, C1q, C1r, C1s, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9.

      Proteins which comprise at least one carbohydrate group (e.g., sugar residue) may be classified as glycoproteins (often also referred to as mucoproteins).
      <br/>
      The term seromucoid is often used to refer to glycoproteins derived from blood serum.
      <br/>
      In glycoproteins, typically one or more sugar residues are attached to the protein via the side chain of an amino acid residue.
      <br/>
      Many blood proteins, and virtually all plasma proteins except albumin, are glycoproteins.
      <br/>
      For example,  GAMMA -globulins (e.g., immunoglobulins),  ALPHA 1-globulins, and  ALPHA 2-globulins, are glycoproteins.
      <br/>
      Examples of glycoproteins which have been isolated from human blood include  ALPHA 1-acid glycoprotein,  ALPHA 2-glycoprotein,  ALPHA 2-macroglobulin,  ALPHA 2-HS-glycoprotein,  ALPHA 1-antichymotrypsin,  ALPHA 1-antitrypsin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, pre-albumin, hemopexin, haptoglobin, transferrin, ceruloplasmin, many clotting factors, and many components of the complement system.
      <br/>
      Glycoproteins are found in substances such as orosomucoids (primarily  ALPHA 1-acid glycoprotein), mucin (a cell secretion), and ovomucoids (derived from egg white), which contain high quantities (e.g., about 30-50%) of carbohydrates.

      Human blood plasma is a valuable source material for the preparation many of these blood products.
      <br/>
      A number of organizations throughout the world are involved in the fractionation of human plasma into a variety of derivatives intended for clinical use.
      <br/>
      Among the products licensed for use in the United States are albumin, plasma protein fraction (PPF), immunoglobulin for intravenous or intramuscular injection, antihemophilic factor, Factor IX complex (the vitamin K-dependent factors), coagulation Factor IX,  ALPHA 1-antitrypsin (i.e.,  ALPHA 1-proteinase inhibitor), and antithrombin III.

      <br/>
      These hyperimmune donors may be identified during convalescent periods after infection or transfusion, or they may be specifically immunized to produce the desired antibodies.

      Intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV) products have been developed using a variety of methods to remove or inactivate any anticomplementary aggregates.

      The development of IGIV has permitted the administration of much higher dosages, with a subsequent expansion in immunoglobulin therapy.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Drohan, 1994, at Chapter 138.

      The preparation of blood products from blood typically involves a combination of separation steps.

      For example, in the preparation of blood products derived from plasma, whole blood is typically first processed to removed suspended cells and formed elements (e.g., by centrifugation) to yield blood plasma.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, blood serum may be obtained by forming a blood clot (e.g., initiated by the addition of thrombin and calcium ion) and subsequently removing the clot (e.g., by centrifugation).

      In the preparation of blood products and the isolation and characterization of blood components derived from blood plasma, substantial resources are expended in the field of plasma fractionation; that is, in methods for dividing plasma into the fractions rich in particular blood components, and fractions poor in particular blood components.

      Historically, plasma fractionation was achieved by salt precipitation typically using mineral salts such as ammonium sulfate and sodium sulfate; the proteins were precipitated as a result of an increase in salt concentration.
      <br/>
      In the 1940's, Cohn et al. developed an effective alternative precipitation method which employed an organic solvent, ethanol.
      <br/>
      For example, in the well known "Cohn's Method 6" (Cohn et al., 1946), ethanol is added to plasma at specific conditions of pH and temperature to obtain a specific ethanol concentration, and the resulting precipitate separated from the supernatant, and the precipitate retained.
      <br/>
      The supernatant is again treated with ethanol using different specific conditions, and the resulting second precipitate separated from the second supernatant, and the precipitate retained.
      <br/>
      The process is repeated stepwise, so that the resulting second supernatant is similarly processed, yielding a third precipitate and a third supernatant, and so on, thus yielding a sequence of precipitates (e.g., Cohn Precipitates I, II+III, IV-1, IV-4, and V; Cohn Supernatants I, II+III, IV-1, IV-4, and V), each rich in particular plasma components.

      Cryoprecipitation (e.g., the formation of a precipitate from a solution by cooling) has also been used to prepare blood fractions, most importantly a plasma cryoprecipitate rich in Factor VIII.
      <br/>
      In recent years, chromatographic methods (e.g., ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, and gel filtration) have been developed to effect fractionation.

      Many plasma processing procedures employ filtration through relatively coarse filter media to clarify the liquid (e.g., prefiltering), often using a depth filtration process.
      <br/>
      For example, plasma may be filtered through asbestos sheet filters, often in combination with diatomaceous earth as a filter precoat.
      <br/>
      A variety of such filters are commercially available (e.g., from Seitz.RTM., Ertel.RTM., Alsop.RTM., Cellulo.RTM.).

      More recently, plasma has been clarified using alternative cationic depth filters comprising cellulose and diatomaceous earth treated with a cationic charge modifier.

      A variety of such filters are commercially available (e.g., from AMF Cuno.RTM.).

      Other (e.g., anionic) materials suitable for clarification are also known and commercially available (e.g., from Millipore.RTM. and Pall.RTM.).
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Many plasma processing procedures also employ filtration through relatively fine filtration media.
      <br/>
      Such fine filtration media include membrane filters having pore diameters of about 0.1 to 10 microns.
      <br/>
      A variety of such filters are commercially available (e.g., from Millipore.RTM., Gelman Sciences.RTM., Nuclepore.RTM., Pall.RTM., Sartorius.RTM.&amp;).
      <br/>
      For example, sterile filtration typically involves passage of the liquid through one or more membrane filters having pore diameters of about 0.2 microns or less, in order to exclude microorganisms, such as Pseudomonas bacteria.

    <p num="37">
      Since most plasma processing procedures employ at least one precipitation or chromatographic fractionation step, these procedures invariably include further steps to eliminate the precipitating or eluting agents and to concentrate the final product.
      <br/>
      Methods for achieving one or both of these goals include lyophilization, thin film evaporation, gel permeation, and ultrafiltration.
      <br/>
      Thin film evaporation methods are typically used to remove organic solvents.
      <br/>
      Gel permeation methods are typically used to remove precipitating agents, such as ethanol and salts, but yield the desired product in a dilute solution.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Ultrafiltration (i.e., nanofiltration, dialysis) is often performed to achieve one or both goals.
      <br/>
      In many cases, gel permeation in combination with ultrafiltration is employed to obtain the desired product purity and concentration.
      <br/>
      Ultrafiltration methods employ ultrafine filtration media, including, for example, flat membranes, spiral membranes, hollow fiber systems, and tubular systems.
      <br/>
      A variety of such filter materials are commercially available (e.g., from A/G Technology.RTM., Millipore.RTM.).
      <br/>
      Common ultrafiltration membranes are comprised of hollow fiber filters or flat sheet filters (e.g., comprising polyvinylidene fluoride, polysulfone, and/or cellulose ester) having an effective size exclusion of about 25-500 nanometers, or about 1,000 to 500,000 kd.

    <p num="39">
      Filtration (e.g., of plasma, plasma fractions, or partially purified blood products) through fine and/or ultrafine filtration media is invariably hampered by rapid clogging (e.g., fouling) of the filtration media resulting in a low, often impractical, flow rate through the media, as well as increased costs.
      <br/>
      For example, if plasma protein fraction (i.e., PPF) is filtered directly through a 0.2 micron or tighter membrane filter, the throughput is very low and a large amount of the membrane is required to filter even relatively small amounts of PPF.
      <br/>
      Blood components (e.g., lipids, lipid complexes, lipid-like materials, colloids) often cause filtration and separation problems, such as fouling, clogging or otherwise impairing (e.g., "blinding off") filtration and separation media, such as ultrafiltration media and/or chromatographic media.
      <br/>
      However, it has been found that the materials which cause clogging can often be removed by a pre-filtration step through relatively coarse filtration media (as described above), thereby permitting a high throughput through fine and/or ultrafine filtration media, and thus increasing efficiency and reducing costs.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Although pre-filtration methods have increased the efficiencies of fine filtration and ultrafiltration, other methods have been examined.
      <br/>
      For example, pre-treatment methods for the removal of materials (e.g., lipids, lipid complexes, lipid-like materials, colloids) which cause clogging of the filtration media have been investigated.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      For example, a common pre-treatment method involves the use of colloidal fumed silica at a rate of about 40 grams per liter of liquid being treated (i.e., .about 0 (slashed zero) 04 g/mL) (Condie, 1979).
      <br/>
      Lipoproteins, cholesterol, and triglycerides are adsorbed on the colloidal fumed silica, and the resulting residue is removed by centrifugation.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, a large proportion of the liquid (20-50% of the starting volume) remains trapped within the centrifuged precipitate.
      <br/>
      This trapped volume often contains significant quantities of the product sought, and is difficult to recover.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the colloidal fumed silica is not very selective, and significant amounts of albumin and serum immunoglobulins are removed along with the lipids.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Another pre-treatment method involves the use of tricalcium phosphate (i.e., Ca3 (PO4)2) at a rate of about 20-50 grams per liter of liquid being treated (i.e., .about 0 (slashed zero) 02-0.05 g/mL) (Burstein et al., 1957).
      <br/>
      It is believed that the interaction between many lipids (e.g., chylomicra and  BETA 1-lipoproteins) and calcium results in precipitation.
      <br/>
      The resulting colloidal slurry is then centrifuged to remove the tricalcium phosphate and bound lipids.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Yet another pre-treatment method involves the precipitation of lipoproteins from plasma by the addition of dextran sulfate (i.e., a heparin-like polysaccharide containing up to three sulfate groups per sugar residue) at a rate of about 0.1-0.5% w/v (i.e., 0.001-0.005 g/mL).
      <br/>
      The resulting lipid-rich precipitate is then removed by centrifugation.
      <br/>
      However, the clarified serum or plasma then contains dextran sulfate, and additional processing is required for its removal.

    <p num="51">As will become apparent, many preferred features and characteristics of one aspect of the invention are applicable to other aspects of the invention.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="52">The present invention provides methods for the selective separation of organic components from biological fluids containing them, which methods comprise the step of contacting the biological fluid with a synthetic hydrated alkaline earth silicate (i.e., SHAES), such as synthetic hydrated calcium silicate (i.e., SHCS) or synthetic hydrated magnesium silicate (i.e., SHMS).</p>
    <p num="53">
      It may be convenient to consider the SHAES as acting as a selective capture agent for organic components.
      <br/>
      Without being bound to any particular theory, the inventors theorize that the alkali earth metal atoms (e.g., calcium, magnesium) of the SHAES act as a selective attractant for organic components and thereby cause them to become adsorbed.
      <br/>
      The physical structure of the SHAES (e.g., surface area, porosity, pore size, pore volume) may also further result in a sieving of colloidal complexes, thereby assisting the selective capture of the organic components of such complexes.
      <br/>
      While the SHAES is often a particularly effective capture agent for many organic components (e.g., lipids, lipid complexes, lipid-like materials, and colloidal materials), it is often a particularly ineffective capture agent for other organic components (e.g., albumin).
      <br/>
      In this way, the capture properties of SHAES provide a basis for the selective separation of organic components.
    </p>
    <p num="54">In one embodiment, the SHAES, acting as a capture agent, permits the selective separation of contaminating organic components from biological fluids, thus permitting more efficient processing of the remaining biological fluid to obtain a desired organic component.</p>
    <p num="55">
      For example, many biological fluids which contain desired organic components also contain contaminating organic components which inhibit or otherwise complicate further processing (e.g., filtration, clarification, purification) often by fouling the media.
      <br/>
      The methods of the present invention permit the easy removal (e.g., partial or complete) of such contaminating organic components, thereby permitting more efficient processing.
    </p>
    <p num="56">In this regard, the present invention also provides methods for the purification of a desired organic component from a biological fluid which also comprises at least one contaminating organic component, which method comprises the steps of contacting the biological fluid with a SHAES to form a residue (which comprises the SHAES and the contaminating organic component), and separating the residue from the remaining fluid (which comprises the desired organic component).</p>
    <p num="57">In another embodiment, the SHAES, acting as a capture agent, may permit the selective separation of a desired organic component, and thus permit the purification (e.g., and/or isolation) of the desired organic component.</p>
    <p num="58">
      For example, many methods for the purification of desired organic components from biological fluids containing them are often intensive, expensive, time consuming, and frequently suffer from low yield.
      <br/>
      The methods of the present invention permit the harvesting of the desired organic component (by capturing it with SHAES), thereby permitting more efficient purification, isolation, and/or characterization.
    </p>
    <p num="59">In this regard, the present invention also provides methods for the separation (e.g., purification and/or isolation) of a desired organic component from a biological fluid, which method comprises the steps of contacting the biological fluid with a SHAES to form a residue (which comprises the SHAES and the desired organic component), separating the residue from the remaining fluid, and eluting the desired organic component from the residue.</p>
    <p num="60">
      As the SHAES appears to be particularly effective for the capture of lipids (i.e., lipids, lipid complexes, lipid-like materials, and lipid components thereof), as well as colloidal materials, the methods of the present invention are particularly effective for the separation of such materials from biological fluids.
      <br/>
      Thus, in one embodiment, the methods of the present invention are particularly effective for removal of such materials to permit more efficient processing of the remaining fluid.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the methods of the present invention are particularly effective for the harvesting of such materials and thus permit their more efficient purification, isolation, and/or characterization.
      <br/>
      In many cases, such materials further comprise other associated biological components (e.g., as an additional component of a lipid complex) which may be simultaneously harvested.
    </p>
    <p num="61">

      Preferred biological fluids comprise at least one protein component.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      An example of one group of biological fluids are bodily fluids, such as blood (including blood plasma and blood serum), lymph, cerebrospinal fluid, lactation products (e.g., milk), amniotic fluids, urine, saliva, perspiration, tears, including fractions thereof.

    <p num="64">
      Yet another example of a group of biological fluids are cell lysate fluids including fractions thereof.
      <br/>
      For example, cells (such as red blood cells, white blood cells, cultured cells) may be harvested and lysed to obtain a cell lysate (e.g., a biological fluid), from which organic components (e.g., hemoglobin,  ALPHA -interferon, T-cell growth factor, interleukins) may be separated with the aid of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Still another example of a group of biological fluids are culture media fluids including fractions thereof.
      <br/>
      For example, culture media comprising biological products (e.g., proteins secreted by cells cultured therein) may be collected and organic components separated therefrom with the aid of the present invention.

    <p num="69">
      The term "organic mammalian blood component" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to an organic component which may be found in mammalian blood.
      <br/>
      While many organic mammalian blood components are found exclusively in mammalian blood, many other organic mammalian blood components may be also found in other materials (e.g., other fluids, tissues, or cells).
      <br/>

      In some preferred embodiments, the SHAES is in a particulate, powder, granular or pellet form.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the SHAES is SHCS.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Many methods for the preparation of some SHAES have been described.
      <br/>
      See for example, Taylor, 1964.
      <br/>
      SHAES is typically prepared by hydrothermal reaction of a siliceous material (e.g., diatomaceous silica), hydrated alkaline earth oxide, and water.
      <br/>
      Using these methods, the SHAES possesses a highly desirable intricate and porous microstructure (Celite, 1991).
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      In many preferred embodiments, the SHAES is SHCS and comprises 45-95% silicon by weight (reported as SiO2), 5-35% calcium by weight (reported as CaO), and 1-20% H2 O by weight.
      <br/>
      In some preferred embodiments, the SHAES is SHCS and comprises 45-55% silicon by weight (reported as SiO2), 25-35% calcium by weight (reported as CaO), 1-20% H2 O by weight.
      <br/>
      Typically, the balance, usually 1-10% by weight, comprises impurities, such as, for example, aluminum (i.e., Al, typically reported as alumina, Al2 O3), alkali metals (e.g., sodium, Na, and potassium, K, typically reported as the oxides, Na2 O and K2 O, respectively), iron (i.e., Fe, typically reported as Fe2 O3), and magnesium (i.e., Mg, typically reported as the oxide, magnesia, MgO).
      <br/>
      In many preferred embodiments, the SHAES contains a relatively small amount of soluble aluminum.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      In many preferred embodiments, the SHAES is SHCS in powder form, with a particle size of from about 0.01 micron to about 0.10 micron as determined, for example, by x-ray measurements and/or electron microscopy.
      <br/>
      Of these small particles, aggregates as large as about 100 microns may also be present.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, the retention on a 325 mesh sieve is less than about 10% by weight, more preferably less than about 8% by weight.
      <br/>
      In many preferred embodiments, the SHAES is SHCS in powder form with a surface area (as determined, for example, using the B.E.T. method) of more than about 75 m2 /g, usually from about 75 to 200 m2 /g.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      A preferred SHAES, as used in the Examples provided below, is SHCS in a fine powder form which has been prepared by hydrothermal reaction of diatomaceous silica, hydrated calcium oxide (i.e., calcium hydroxide), and water, and which results in the following chemical and physical characteristics: a chemical composition of about 47% silicon by weight (reported as SiO2); about 32% calcium by weight (reported as CaO); about 2.5% aluminum by weight (reported as Al2 O3); about 1.2% sodium and potassium (combined) by weight (reported as Na2 O and K2 O); about 0.7% iron by weight (reported as Fe2 O3); about 0.6% magnesium by weight (reported as MgO); with the remainder as water (i.e., H2 O); a retention on a 325 mesh sieve of about 6% by weight; and a surface area (as determined using the B.E.T. method) of about 120 m2 /g.

      This preferred SHAES is available from Advanced Minerals Corporation, Lompoc, Calif., USA.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      In the methods of the present invention, the biological fluid is contacted with a SHAES.
      <br/>
      The term "contacted" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to the step of bringing the biological fluid to be treated into contact with the SHAES.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, the biological fluid to be treated may be contacted with the SHAES by mixing the biological fluid and the SHAES.
      <br/>
      The term "mixing" is used herein in the conventional sense and includes conventional methods for mixing, such as, for example, blending, stirring, shaking, and the like, as may be carried out with the aid of any mechanical means, including, for example, paddles, propellers, blades, shakers, rollers, and the like.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments wherein the biological fluid to be treated is mixed with the SHAES, it is preferable to maintain the SHAES as a suspension in the biological fluid during the contacting step.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, the biological fluid to be treated may be contacted with the SHAES by passing the biological fluid through the SHAES supported on a septum.
      <br/>
      In such embodiments, the biological fluid may be passed through a bed of the SHAES or through a filter pad, cartridge, or sheet comprising the SHAES.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      The ratio of SHAES to biological fluid used in the contacting step may be chosen according the amount of organic component to be captured which is present in the biological fluid, and the degree to which the organic component is to be captured.
      <br/>
      Increasing the ratio of SHAES to biological fluid will increase the degree to which the organic component is captured.
      <br/>
      Typically, the ratio of SHAES to biological fluid is from about 0.001 to about 0.1 g/mL. In a preferred embodiment, the ratio of SHAES to biological fluid is from about 0.001 to about 0.05 g/mL. In another preferred embodiment, the ratio of SHAES to biological fluid is about 0.001 to about 0.02 g/mL.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The length of time that the biological fluid to be treated is contacted with the SHAES may be chosen according to the amount of organic component to be captured which is present in the biological fluid, and the degree to which the organic component is to be captured.
      <br/>
      Increasing the contact time generally increases the degree to which the organic component is captured.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the biological fluid to be treated is contacted with the SHAES for a time of more than about 30 seconds (usually in the range of from about 30 seconds to about 24 hours); more preferably from about 1 minute to about 6 hours; still more preferably from about 10 minutes to 1 hour.
      <br/>
      In embodiments where the biological fluid to be treated is passed through the SHAES (e.g., on a septum, in a filter sheet, pad, or cartridge), it may be necessary to increase the contact time to permit sufficient capture of the organic component.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the flow rate of the biological fluid to be treated through the SHAES is from about 0.1 to 1.0 mL per minute per 15 cm2.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      The temperature at which the biological fluid to be treated is contacted with the SHAES may be chosen according to the physical and chemical properties of the biological fluid and the materials therein.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the biological fluid to be treated is contacted with the SHAES at a temperature of from about -10 (degree)  C. to about 40 (degree)  C. In another preferred embodiment, the biological fluid to be treated is contacted with the filtration media at room temperature (e.g., about 20 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The pressure at which the biological fluid to be treated is contacted with the SHAES may range from a moderate vacuum to several atmospheres, but it usually about 1 atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The methods of the present invention include the step of contacting a biological fluid with a SHAES, thereby forming a SHAES residue and remaining fluid.
      <br/>
      In embodiments where the biological fluid to be treated is mixed with the SHAES, it may be desirable, and is often necessary, to subsequently remove or otherwise separate the SHAES residue from the remaining fluid (i.e., treated biological fluid).
      <br/>
      The SHAES residue may be separated from the treated biological fluid using known methods, including, for example, filtration (e.g., gravity filtration, pressure filtration), sedimentation, centrifugation, and the like.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the terms "treated biological fluid" and "remaining fluid" refer to the biological fluid which is obtained at some time after contacting of the biological fluid with the SHAES has begun.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Following treatment, it may be desirable to adjust the pH of the treated biological fluid, since contact with the SHAES often results in an increase in pH.
      <br/>
      The pH of the treated biological fluid may be adjusted to a desired pH using known methods.
      <br/>
      For example, the pH of the treated biological fluid may be reduced by the addition of a suitable acid (e.g., one which does not denature the desired products) including, for example, acetic acid (i.e., CH3 COOH), hydrochloric acid (i.e., HCl), and phosphoric acid (i.e., H3 PO4), typically at concentrations of about 0.1 to 1 N.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      In those embodiments where a desired organic component has been captured by the SHAES, it may be desirable to elute (or otherwise release) the desired organic component from the SHAES residue.
      <br/>
      Methods for eluting organic components (e.g., lipids, proteins), are well known and include, for example, treatment with chelating agents (e.g., citrate) and organic solvents (e.g., ethanol, ether).
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      The methods of the present invention are particularly useful in the fractionation of mammalian blood.
      <br/>
      For example, fractionation methods which employ ultrafiltration may greatly benefit from pre-treatment of the fluid to be ultrafiltered according to the methods of the present invention, so as to remove materials (e.g., lipids, lipid complexes, lipid-like materials, colloids) which may cause clogging of the ultrafiltration media.
      <br/>
      In this way, ultrafiltration efficiency may be greatly improved.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The methods of the present invention are also particularly useful in the preparation of mammalian blood concentrates.
      <br/>
      For example, a desired blood component may be captured, and subsequently eluted, using the methods of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this way, blood components may be purified, isolated, and/or characterized.

      <br/>
      The slurry was mixed for approximately 30 min at 0 (degree)  C. The residue was removed by centrifugation (i.e., in a Beckman.RTM. J6B swinging one liter bucket rotor at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 0 (degree)  C.), or by pressure filtering (i.e., through a coarse cellulose Cuno.RTM. CPX-01A depth filter pad, at 0 (degree)  C. with a pressure of 5 psi, 35 kPa).

    <p num="93">
      The concentrations of a number of plasma components in the untreated and treated samples were determined by radial immunodiffusion (i.e., RID) using commercially available kits (Binding Site Ltd.COPYRGT., Birmingham, England).
      <br/>
      Briefly, RID is an analytical technique based on antibody-antigen reactions.
      <br/>
      The specific antibody for the target protein is provided in a stationary phase of agarose.
      <br/>
      The target protein (i.e., the antigen) and control standards are loaded into wells in fixed amounts.
      <br/>
      The target protein diffuses from the well and, in about three days, a precipitation ring is formed.
      <br/>
      The ring is the result of the antibody-antigen reaction and the measured diameter is used to determine the concentration of the target protein in the original sample.
      <br/>
      The amount of plasma component removed by treatment with SHAES was calculated as the difference between the amount observed in control experiments (without treatment) and the amount observed following treatment.
      <br/>
      The results are summarized in Table 1.
      <br/>
      In many cases, treatment with as little as 0.01 g/mL SHCS yielded a substantial reduction in the concentration of the plasma components investigated.

    <p num="96">Improved Ultrafiltration</p>
    <p num="97">
      This example demonstrates how pretreatment of a blood plasma fraction with SHAES permits faster and more efficient ultrafiltration.
      <br/>
      More specifically, this example demonstrates how pre-treatment effects removal (e.g., partial or complete) of a number of blood components from chromatographically purified  ALPHA 1-proteinase inhibitor ( ALPHA 1-PI) solutions and thus permits faster and more efficient ultrafiltration.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      A sample of  ALPHA 1-proteinase inhibitor was chromatographically purified by ion exchange chromatography using a series of columns and exploiting isoelectric points for specific contaminants, as follows.
      <br/>
      Cohn Fraction IV-1 centrifuged precipitate, obtained using standard methods, was solubilized in an aqueous sodium citrate solution (pH 6.0-7.2) at a ratio of 1:30 precipitate to solution (w/v).
      <br/>
      Many contaminants were then removed by passing the solution through a DEAE.RTM. ion exchange resin and CM Sepharose.RTM. ion exchange resin, in that order, and collecting the resulting column filtrate (i.e., the "fall-through" solution).
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      The fall-through solution containing the  ALPHA 1-proteinase inhibitor was analyzed by standard SDS gel electrophoresis methods (i.e., using a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel), and found to contain contaminants such as orosomucoids,  ALPHA 2-macroglobulin,  ALPHA 1-acid glycoprotein, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, and  BETA 2-microglobulin.
      <br/>
      The electrophoresis results are summarized in Table 2.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      In control runs, the fall-through solution (i.e., untreated solution) was further processed without pre-treatment with SHAES.
      <br/>
      In pre-treatment runs, the fall-through solution was pre-treated with synthetic hydrated calcium silicate (obtained from Advanced Minerals Corporation, Lompoc, California, USA) as follows.
      <br/>
      Hydrated calcium silicate was added to the fall-through solution (i.e., 100 grams per 50 liters; that is, 0.002 g/mL) at pH 6.4. The slurry was mixed for approximately 30-60 min at 18-22 (degree)  C. The suspension was then filter clarified by passing through a 293 mm diameter Cellulo.RTM. 2350P disk filter pad.
      <br/>
      The pre-reated solution was also analyzed by standard SDS gel electrophoresis methods and the results are summarized in Table 2.
      <br/>
      The pre-treated solution retained the desired  ALPHA 1-proteinase inhibitor (the presence of citrate prevents the  ALPHA 1-proteinase inhibitor from being captured by the SHAES); however, many of the contaminants were not detected.

      Samples of the untreated and pre-treated solutions were then identically processed.
      <br/>
      Prior to ultrafiltration, samples were further clarified by passing through a 0.2 micron Durapore.RTM. filter (from Millipore.RTM.).
      <br/>
      Ultrafiltration was effected by passing the solution through a 500K hollow fiber filter (from A/G Technology.RTM.) having an area of 7 ft2 (i.e., 0.65 m2) using a back pressure of 15 psi (i.e., 104 kPa), and the permeate collected.
      <br/>
      During ultrafiltration, the solution being filtered was recirculated at 8-10 liters/hour and maintained at 20 (degree)  C. The volume of liquid being ultrafiltered (i.e., initial volume) and the final volume of permeate obtained (i.e., permeate volume) were recorded.
      <br/>
      The rate of accumulation of permeate was also periodically recorded.
      <br/>
      Ultrafiltration was continued until most of the initial volume (e.g., about 90%) was recovered or until the rate of accumulation of permeate had decreased to about 10-25% of the initial rate (e.g., reached a plugging condition).

      In control runs, the rate of accumulation of permeate decreased steadily and ultrafiltration was discontinued when the rate of accumulation of permeate had decreased to 10-25% of the initial rate and had reached a plugging condition (usually after about 25 to 60 minutes).
      <br/>
      In contrast, in pre-treatment runs, the rate of accumulation of permeate was only moderately reduced and ultrafiltation was continued to completion.
      <br/>
      Even at completion, the rate of accumulation of permeate had only been reduced by about 40-50% in pre-treatment runs.
      <br/>
      The recovery rate (i.e., ratio of permeate volume to initial volume) in pre-treatment runs was substantially higher than in control runs (e.g., about 93% as opposed to 30-65%).

    <p num="107">This example demonstrates how the cholesterol content of blood serum can be reduced by treatment with SHAES.</p>
    <p num="108">
      Three samples of human blood serum (Sigma Chemical Company.RTM.) were treated identically.
      <br/>
      To each 100 mL sample was added 4 g of synthetic hydrated calcium silicate (obtained from Advanced Minerals Corporation, Lompoc, Calif., USA), and the slurry mixed for approximately 30 min at 20 (degree)  C. The residue was removed by pressure filtering (i.e., through a coarse cellulose Cuno.RTM. CPX-01A depth filter pad, at 20 (degree)  C. with a pressure of 5-10 psi, 35-70 kPa).
      <br/>
      The filtrate was collected and assayed for total cholesterol content using a commercially available diagnostic kit (Kit 352-20 from Sigma Chemical Company.RTM.).
      <br/>
      Briefly, an enzymatic, calorimetric, endpoint method is employed in which cholesterol esters are converted to cholesterol; cholesterol is converted to cholest-4-en-one producing hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct; and the hydrogen peroxide causes the formation of quinoneimine dye, which is detected spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 500 nm.

      Data for the untreated (i.e., control) and treated samples are summarized in Table 4.

      The pH of the resulting solution was adjusted to 6.0 with the addition of 1 N NaOH.

The slurry was then centrifuged in a Beckman.RTM. J6B swinging bucket rotor at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 20 (degree)  C. The centrifuged pellet (approximately 1.0 gram) was suspended in a 0.1 M sodium citrate solution to elute the bound material.
