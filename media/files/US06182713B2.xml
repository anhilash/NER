    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to an installation for filling a container with gas whose nature is according to a predetermined specification, comprising:</p>
    <p num="2">
      an assembly or plurality of sources of supply gas;
      <br/>
      at least one connector for connecting the or each container;
      <br/>
      a network of control valves, selectively connecting the output of each supply gas source to the or each connector; and
      <br/>
      a drive or control unit for the network of valves adapted to control the condition of the valves for filling the or each container with a gas according to the predetermined specification.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Pure gases or gaseous mixtures are now filled into cylinders or frames carrying a group of cylinders.
      <br/>
      They are filled in a filling installation and then brought to the site of utilization of the gas.
    </p>
    <p num="4">So as to permit the filling of containers with gases of different compositions and under different pressures, the filling installations conventionally comprise a network of valves permitting selectively connecting to the container to be filled an assembly of sources of supply gas.</p>
    <p num="5">
      To ensure filling of the container with a gas satisfying a predetermined specification, the opening and closing of the valves is at present entrusted to an operator.
      <br/>
      The latter opens and closes the different valves, at predetermined moments, and according to a predetermined sequence.
      <br/>
      The operation of such an installation therefore requires the continuous presence of an experienced operator who determines the sequence of operations.
    </p>
    <p num="6">It has been proposed to replace manual valves by control valves connected to a drive unit adapted to control the condition of the valves for filling a receptacle with a gas according to the predetermined specification.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In such an installation, the drive unit is adapted to receive at its input the specifications of the gas to be introduced into the container.
      <br/>
      The input data consist particularly in the mass composition, or in the pressure of the different components constituting the gas.
      <br/>
      Thus, the information input into the drive unit is the result relied on for the filling operation.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Such a filling installation requires an extremely complex drive unit whose program that is utilized depends both on the physical structure of the network of valves used and on the nature of the gases to be introduced.</p>
    <p num="9">
      By way of example, FR-A-2.713.105 describes an installation for filling a reservoir with a gaseous mixture.
      <br/>
      This installation comprises a computer driving the cyclic opening and closing of valves arranged between the reservoir and sources of gas under pressure.
      <br/>
      The computer receives as its controls the composition relied on to effect the mixture.
      <br/>
      It is adapted to predetermine and carry out a cycle for driving the various valves so as to obtain the desired mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Moreover, JP-2675633 describes an installation for filling cylinders comprising several sources of gas that can supply selectively the cylinders under the control of a control unit.
      <br/>
      The operational steps of the control unit and the input variables are not disclosed.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">The invention has for its object to provide a simple installation for filling, permitting making uniform and standard the installations used for filling at various sites, thereby facilitating the filling of containers whilst improving the reproducability and reliability of the operations of filling with gas.</p>

    <p num="43">The program given here comprises six procedures each corresponding to a line on the table.</p>
    <p num="44">
      Considering the program in the table of FIG. 1, so as to obtain filling of the bottles, the first procedure used consists in carrying out opening the cylinders to the atmosphere by opening the atmospheric valve 30, so as to ensure a pressure drop to a pressure of 1.5 bar absolute  +- 20%.
      <br/>
      Once this pressure is reached, the atmospheric valve 30 is closed.
      <br/>
      After a time delay of a second, the vacuum valve 34 is opened to effect a pressure drop to a value of 0.20 bar absolute  +- 20%.
      <br/>
      After this pressure has been reached and after expiration of a time delay of one second, the oxygen inlet valve 24 is opened to ensure pressure increase in the cylinders to a pressure of 5 bars absolute  +- 20%.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Four seconds after this pressure has been reached, the atmosphere valve 30 is opened until the pressure in the distribution conduit 38 reaches a reference pressure value equal to 1.5 bar absolute  +- 20%.</p>
    <p num="46">After one second, the distribution conduit 38 is placed under vacuum by opening the vacuum valve 34 until the pressure falls to a reference pressure of 0.2 bar absolute  +- 20%.</p>
    <p num="47">The oxygen inlet valve 24 is then again opened until the pressure in the distribution conduit 38 and hence in the cylinders, reaches 201 bars absolute  +- 5%.</p>
    <p num="48">The cylinders thus filled are then closed and the installation is purged.</p>
    <p num="49">
      The presence of three filling rows 46, 48, 50 permits overlapping operations.
      <br/>
      Thus, each row is connected in parallel to the output of the valve network 12 through its own valve 52, 54, 56.
      <br/>
      Thus, while a group of 16 cylinders is filled on one of the rows, another group to be filled is installed on a second row, whilst a third group of cylinders, previously filled, is detached from the third row.
      <br/>
      During filling on a given row, the selecting valve associated with this row is open, whilst the valves of the other rows are kept closed, which permits operating on the cylinders.
    </p>
    <p num="50">Thus, the installation can ensure the filling of cylinders substantially continuously.</p>
    <p num="51">
      The selecting valve 40 mounted in parallel with the regulating valve 42 permits ensuring a diversion of the gas flow when the gas flow is maximum, the regulating valve being then inoperative.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, for low flows, which must be regulated with precision, the diversion valve 40 is closed and the flow substantially passes through the regulating valve 42.

    <p num="60">
      Considering the program shown in Table 2, so as to obtain filling of the cylinders with a proportion of 20% oxygen and 80% nitrogen, the first procedure used consists in opening the cylinders to the atmosphere by opening the atmosphere valve 30 so as to ensure a pressure drop to a pressure of 1.5 bar absolute  +- 20%.

      Once this pressure has been reached, the atmosphere valve 30 is closed.
      <br/>
      After a time delay of one second, the vacuum valve 34 is opened to effect a pressure drop to a value of 0.20 bar absolute  +- 20%.
      <br/>
      After this pressure has been reached and after the expiration of a time delay of one second, the nitrogen inlet valve 26 is opened to cause a pressure increase in the cylinders to a pressure of 5 bars absolute  +- 20%.
    </p>
    <p num="61">Nine seconds after this pressure has been reached, the atmosphere valve 30 is opened until the pressure in the distribution conduit 38 reaches a reference pressure value of 1.5 bar absolute  +- 20%.</p>
    <p num="62">After one second, the distribution conduit 38 is placed under vacuum by opening the vacuum valve 34 until the pressure falls to a reference pressure of 0.2 bar absolute  +- 20%.</p>
    <p num="63">
      The oxygen inlet valve 24 is then opened until the weight of the pilot cylinder 72, determined by the scales 80, reaches 2.633 kg  +- 5%.
      <br/>
      Four seconds after the closure of the valve 24, the nitrogen inlet valve 26 is opened until the mass of one of the cylinders reaches 9.294 kg  +- 5%.
    </p>
    <p num="64">The cylinders thus filled are then closed and the installation is purged.</p>
    <p num="65">The filling installation of FIG. 3 is adapted to fill mixtures of compressed gas as a function of the pressure corrected for temperature and the weight of the entire group of cylinders to be filled.</p>

      To this end, the installation comprises a single filling row 100 to which is connected all of the 16 cylinders 102 of a group to be filled.
