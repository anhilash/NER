    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Many radio frequency oscillators today depend on the use of high dielectric coaxial resonators to establish the frequency of oscillation.
      <br/>
      These resonators are generally available off the shelf or can be customized to a particular frequency.
      <br/>
      The resonators are small, but relatively expensive, e.g. more than 20 times, in comparison with common surface mount parts such as resistors and capacitors.
      <br/>
      However, where high performance and stability are needed there are few alternatives.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In the case of a variable frequency oscillator, the frequency of the resonator needs to be pulled above or below the natural frequency of oscillation.
      <br/>
      This is normally done by shunting the resonator with a varactor diode, which changes in capacitance depending on the DC voltage at its terminals.
      <br/>
      Adding this component unfortunately lowers the performance, as the varactor is subject to more loss than the resonator.
      <br/>
      As the tuning range is made wider, the loading by the varactor becomes more significant, reducing the benefit of the original resonator in terms of its high performance and good phase noise performance.
      <br/>
      In short, the use of an expensive dielectric resonator becomes difficult to justify in a circuit where the quality factor, Q, is impaired by other components connected to it.
    </p>
    <p num="4">In these cases where the resonator Q of the oscillator becomes heavily dominated by the varactor or other tuning components, the use of a high Q resonator has little effect on the overall loaded Q.</p>
    <p num="5">
      In an attempt to overcome some of these problems, various alternative resonators have been proposed.
      <br/>
      For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,420,554 discloses a method and apparatus for adjusting a resonant frequency of a transmission line resonator assembly.
      <br/>
      The '554 patent uses laser tuning to center the resonant frequency.
      <br/>
      The tuning is accomplished by deflecting a metallized plastic assembly that is located directly atop a resonator electrode.
      <br/>
      However, the '554 patent does not make clear how deflection, and thus tuning, is made permanent.
      <br/>
      Further, the '554 device is fabricated on a printed circuit board rather than using thick film technology, which would allow for surface mounting in numerous applications.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In view of the above, there is a need for a low cost resonator that can offer performance that is nearly equivalent to the performance offered by a high Q coaxial dielectric design.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The problems addressed above are in large part solved by a resonator of the present invention.

      The resonator structure is made of low cost alumina offering performance in a variable frequency oscillator application that is nearly equivalent to that of a high Q dielectric design.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="9">
      FIGS. 1A, 1B and 1C depict a slab resonator 10 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Slab resonator 10 preferably comprises a "slab" 11 of alumina having a bottom side 12 and a thick film, metallized top side 14.
      <br/>
      Top side 14 is preferably metallized with palladium or silver creating a top side ground pattern 15.
      <br/>
      By way of illustrative example, slab resonator 10 is appropriately 0.5 inches in length, 0.3 inches in width and 0.025 inches in thickness, of course other dimensions may be used without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      A plurality of metallized, conducting vias 16 surround the perimeter of slab resonator 10.
      <br/>
      As with top side 14, vias 16 are preferably plated with palladium or silver.
      <br/>
      Bottom side 12 of slab 11 includes a transmission line 18 having a proximal end 20 and a distal end 22, proximal end 20 defining a positive terminal 24.
      <br/>
      Transmission line 18 preferably comprises a palladium or silver metallized strip.
      <br/>
      Positive terminal 24 is isolated from top side ground pattern 15 by a "moat" geometry 26.
      <br/>
      Distal end 22 of transmission line 18 is connected to top side 14 through use of a plated via 16.
      <br/>
      The other plated vias 16 operate to provide a connection between metallized top side 14 and bottom side 12.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      FIG. 2 depicts how vias 16 and "moat" geometry 26 are preferably formed through laser scribing.
      <br/>
      The laser scribing is achieved through the indicated step and repeat pattern.
      <br/>
      In this manner, a plurality of slab resonators 10 may be created at a single time.
      <br/>
      With the laser scribing completed, slab resonators 10 can easily be snapped apart for low-cost, high-volume manufacture.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      FIG. 3A depicts a printed circuit board (PCB) footprint for slab resonator 10.
      <br/>
      Slab resonator 10 is preferably incorporated into a parent oscillator circuit 28 by direct soldering, e.g. using surface mount technology (SMT), to a host PCB 30, see FIG. 3B, of parent oscillator circuit 28.
      <br/>
      The PCB 30 is preferably of 0.062 inch FR-4 with a copper, grounded metal pattern and is preferably in the shape of a horseshoe.
      <br/>
      The horseshoe-shaped, grounded metal pattern 32 allows solder to flow from PCB 30 ground up the sides of slab resonator 10.
      <br/>
      Connection to the positive terminal 24 of slab resonator 10 is made through a surface mount to a separate, positive terminal contact 34 on PCB 30.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In operation, upon DC turn on, oscillator circuit 28 oscillates at the natural frequency of slab resonator 10 (including PCB effects and loading).
      <br/>
      Tuning the frequency of oscillator circuit 28 is a matter of trimming, e.g. of removing top side 14 metal from slab resonator 10 until the desired frequency is met.
      <br/>
      Trimming along a horizontal direction, as shown in FIG. 4, lowers the frequency of oscillator circuit 28.
      <br/>
      The horizontal trimming acts to raise the impedance of transmission line 18 making it more inductive and, thereby, lowering oscillator frequency.
      <br/>
      Trimming along a vertical direction, as shown in FIG. 5, raises the frequency of oscillator circuit 28.
      <br/>
      The vertical trimming acts to reduce capacitive loading of slab resonator 10 and, thereby, raises frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The tuning of slab resonator 10 may be performed either manually or by using laser trimming techniques.
      <br/>
      Manual trimming is preferably performed by using a small grinding tool while laser trimming is generally performed by using a commercial laser trimmer with a program to iteratively seek the frequency desired.
      <br/>
      The preferred method of tuning slab resonator 10 is via laser trimming.
      <br/>
      The laser trimmer may iteratively trim both horizontally and vertically to precisely achieve the desired operating frequency.
      <br/>
      With the ability to adjust frequency both up and down (i.e. trim vertically and horizontally, respectively), a misstep in tuning is not a catastrophe.
      <br/>
      For instance, if the laser trimmer were to "overshoot" the desired frequency, that desired frequency could still be obtained by additional vertical or horizontal trimming; no external tuning or resonator replacement is required.
      <br/>
      Slab resonator 10 is tunable over a wide range with substantially no effect on oscillator phase noise or signal amplitude.
      <br/>
      Note that while typical coaxial dielectric resonators can be adjusted by grinding off a metal jacket, there is usually a severe tradeoff of performance (Q) if too much metal is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The inexpensive, slab resonator 10 is able to achieve phase noise levels, in the 900-1400 MHz range,that rival expensive, dielectric transmission line devices.
      <br/>
      However, in order for slab resonator 10 to realize these low phase noise levels, the characteristic impedance of slab resonator 10 must be properly set.
      <br/>
      Research performed during the development of slab resonator 10 shows that using a short slab 10 with a relatively large capacitance results in improved phase noise compared with a long slab and little or no capacitance.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 6A, depicts, by way of non-limiting example, a short slab resonator, 0.260 inches in length, and an appropriate large, resonating capacitance connected in parallel.
      <br/>
      Near resonance, the short slab resonator 10 can be modeled as a simple LRC parallel resonator.
      <br/>
      As such, the equivalent LRC circuit of FIG. 6A is provided in FIG. 6B. The values for L, R and C were determined using an HP 4291A RF impedance analyzer.
      <br/>
      The determination of the unloaded Q of the short slab configuration may be calculated as follows:
      <br/>
      Q= OMEGA RC=30.83  (1)

      <br/>
      Near resonance, the long slab resonator 10 can be modeled as a simple LRC parallel resonator.
      <br/>
      As such, the equivalent LRC circuit of FIG. 7A is provided in FIG. 7B. The values for L, R, and C were determined using an HP 4291A RF impedance analyzer.
      <br/>
      The determination of the unloaded Q of the long slab configuration may be calculated as follows:

      Q= OMEGA RC=25.21  (3)
      <br/>
      where:  OMEGA =2 PI fres =2 PI (1.75 GHz);

    <p num="23">FIG. 7D provides a polar impedance plot of long slab resonator.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The above calculations indicate that, although the unloaded Q and resonant frequency (fres) of each of these configurations is roughly equivalent, the L-to-C ratio makes a noticeable difference in performance.
      <br/>
      That is, the phase response of the short slab configuration is much sharper (data indicates more than twice as sharp) as the long slab resonator configuration.
      <br/>
      As such, to achieve optimum operation of slab resonator 10, a resonating, loading capacitor 40 should be included to complete a resonating structure 42.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The use of capacitor 40 adds only a modest cost to slab resonator 10, making resonating structure 42, i.e. slab resonator 10 and capacitor 40, an inexpensive and viable alternative to expensive dielectric transmission line resonators.
      <br/>
      Further, capacitor 40 has no special soldering or mounting requirements, it is simply added between transmission line 18 of slab resonator and ground.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Note that at 1 GHz, the optimal size of slab resonator 10 is 0.650 inches long by 0.375 inches wide for either a 950 MHz or 1400 MHz application.
      <br/>
      For the 950 MHz application, capacitor 40 is preferably 3.8 pF while for the 1400 MHz application, capacitor 40 is preferably 1.0 pF. If slab resonator 10 is too long, the tuning range will be good, i.e. extended, but the phase noise will be poor.
      <br/>
      If slab resonator 10 is too short, the phase noise will be good but the oscillator will be stiff and have a limited tuning bandwidth due to the "swamping" effect of the parallel capacitor 40.
      <br/>
      The optimal size, as described immediately above, provides a tuning range of more than 50 MHz at 1400 MHz and 25 MHz at 950 MHz.

      Slab resonator 10 was tested in a parent oscillator circuit 28, specifically, a 1.4 GHz voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) application.

      The test results indicate a phase noise of better than 110 dBc/Hz at 15 KHz offset, with a tuning range of nearly 60 MHz from 1 to 5V, the data from the test is provided in FIG. 9A.
