      A method for oral treatment of patients using different types of drugs that are not usually transported to circulation, if administered orally, is disclosed.
      <br/>
      Because the TC II-Cbl complex is stable to acid and proteolytic enzymes both outside and inside the intestinal absorptive cells, the method consists of oral administration of a drug bound to TC II-Cbl complex.
      <br/>
      In addition, the method can also be used for delivering Cbl to a large number of patients who do not absorb Cbl due to a variety of causes such as surgery of their stomach (ulcers) or of their terminal ileum (Crohn's disease).

    <p num="1">
      This invention was made with United States Government support awarded by Grant No. NIDDK-50052.
      <br/>
      The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.
    </p>
    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
    <p num="2">Not applicable.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The plasma transport of Cobalamin (Cbl; Vitamin B12) to all tissues/cells occurs bound to a plasma transporter, transcobalamin II (TC II), by receptor-mediated endocytosis �1� via transcobalamin II-receptor (TC II-R).
      <br/>
      Recent studies �2� have shown that TC II-R is expressed as a non-covalent homodimer of molecular mass of 124 kDa in all human �2�, rat �3� and rabbit �4� tissue plasma membranes.
      <br/>
      The plasma membrane expression of TC II-R is important for the tissue/cellular uptake of Cbl since its functional inactivation in vivo by its circulatory antiserum causes intracellular deficiency of Cbl which in turn results in the development of Cbl deficiency of the animal as a whole �4�. Although TC II-R is expressed in the plasma membrane of all cells, its polarity of expression in epithelial cells is not known.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Recent immunoblot studies �3� have revealed that in the rat kidney, TC II-R protein is expressed in both the isolated apical and basolateral membranes with an enrichment in the basolateral membranes by about 8 fold.
      <br/>
      However, how TC II-Cbl internalized via the TC II-R from either the apical or basolateral surface is processed is not known.
      <br/>
      Recent TC II-57 �Co�Cbl uptake studies �4� using filter grown polarized Caco-2 cells have shown that 57 �Co�Cbl taken up from the basolateral side in these cells was utilized as Cbl coenzymes suggesting that these cells derive Cbl essential for their use from the basolateral side.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Despite these studies, the details of intracellular sorting of Cbl and TC II by a polarized epithelial cell are poorly understood.
      <br/>
      The present studies were undertaken to address the issues related to polarized expression and function of TC II-R in human intestinal derived Caco-2 cells, a well established cell model used extensively to study nutrient transport and general intestinal epithelial cell biology �5, 6�.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Needed in the art of cell biology is a method by which cell surface receptors, such as TCII-R, that bind to polypeptide ligands can be used to transport various drugs, including Cbl, across epithelial cell barriers, such as the one that exists in the intestine.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention is a method of treating a patient with a therapeutic drug, preferably a drug that cannot normally be administered orally because it is inactivated prior to absorption or is not absorbed.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment a hydrophobic drug, preferably a synthetic organic molecule, is conjugated to a cobalamin molecule.
      <br/>
      The cobalamin drug conjugate is then bound to transcobalamin II and an effective amount is orally delivered to the patient.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The cobalamin/drug conjugate bound to transcobalamin II will be transcytosed from the intestinal lumen to circulation as an intact complex.
      <br/>
      The complex present in the circulation will be taken up by all cells and following internalization be targeted to lysosomes, wherein the complex will be degraded and the drug liberated.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In another form of the present invention, physiological amounts of cobalamin are orally delivered to vitamin B12 -deficient patients.
      <br/>
      An effective amount of the complex of transcobalamin II-cobalamin will be supplied and orally ingested by patients.
    </p>
    <p num="10">In another embodiment of the present invention, a drug is conjugated directly to a transcobalamin II molecule and an effective amount is orally delivered to the patient.</p>
    <p num="11">
      In another embodiment, the present invention is the transcobalamin II-cobalamin-therapeutic drug complex.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the present invention is the transcobalamin II-therapeutic drug complex.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the present invention is the transcobalamin II-cobalamin complex.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      It is a feature of the present invention that one is able to orally deliver therapeutic drugs to the circulation of a patient.
      <br/>
      This feature is especially important when the drug selected is one that is destroyed by acid or proteases if it is administered orally.
    </p>
    <p num="13">It is another feature of the present invention that one is able to deliver a therapeutic drug across the gastrointestinal tract to the circulation of the patient through the mediation of the transcobalamin II receptor expressed in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
    <p num="14">Other features, advantages and objects of the present invention will become apparent after review of the specification, claims and drawings.</p>

      Filter-grown Caco-2 cells expressed TCII-R in both the apical and the basolateral membranes with an enrichment in the basolateral membranes by 6.8-fold.
      <br/>
      TCII-R expressed in both surface membranes was functional in the internalization of 57 �Co�Cbl bound to transcobalamin II (TC II).
      <br/>
      Following 5 hours of internalization from the apical side, all of the 57 �Co�Cbl (.about.30 fmol) was transcytosed to the basolateral side still bound to TC II and lysosomotropic agents chloroquine or leupeptin had no effect on its transcytosis.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, following 5 hours of internalization from the basolateral side, all of the 57 �Co�Cbl (.about.180 fmol) internalized was retained by the cells being transferred from TC II to other cellular proteins.
      <br/>
      Lysosomal inhibitors chloroquine or leupeptin inhibited (65-70%) the intracellular retention of 57 �Co�Cbl and all of the Cbl radioactivity was now bound to TC II being distributed in the intracellular (35-45%, 55-65 fmol) compartments and the basolateral (55-65%, 120-125 fmol) medium.
      <br/>
      In the presence or absence of lysosomal inhibitors intact 43 kDa 125 I-TC II was transcytosed from the apical to the basolateral side following the apical uptake of 125 I-TC II-Cbl.
      <br/>
      In contrast, in the absence of lysosomal inhibitors, 125 I-TC II was degraded inside the cell and the degraded (28 kDa) TC II was secreted back into the basolateral medium following the basolateral uptake of 125 I-TC II-Cbl.
      <br/>
      In the presence of lysosomal inhibitors, labeled TC II accumulated both in the cell and in the basolateral medium.
      <br/>
      When 125 I-TC II-Cbl was orally administered to rats, intact 43 kDa labeled TC II was detected in the portal blood 4 and 8 h later.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Based on these studies we suggest that a) Caco-2 cells process TC II-Cbl by a hitherto unrecognized non-lysosomal pathway in which both TC II and Cbl are transcytosed following apical endocytosis of TC II-Cbl via TCII-R, b) TCO II-Cbl endocytosed from the basolateral side in Caco-2 cells is processed via the lysosomal pathway in which TC II is degraded and the released Cbl is utilized and c) TCII-R expressed in the apical membranes of the rat intestinal mucosa is also functional in mediating endocytosis and eventual transcytosis, if the ligand, TC II-Cbl is presented to the intestinal lumen.</p>

      The Examples below disclose that the plasma transport of cobalamin (Cbl; Vitamin B12) is mediated by the plasma transporter, transcobalamin II (TC II).

      The newly discovered non-lysosomal pathway of TC II-Cbl transcytosis from the apical (luminal) to the basolateral (circulation) side via TCII-R may be used as a mode of oral delivery of therapeutic drugs and the delivery of Cbl for the treatment of Cbl-deficient patients.

      Thus, the method of the present invention begins with the conjugation of either a therapeutic drug, preferably a hydrophobic drug such as a synthetic organic molecule, to Cbl.
      <br/>
      Preferred methods of attaching the therapeutic drug to the Cbl molecule are described below.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the preferred drug can be conjugated to Cbl via biotin.

      Biotin is conjugated to either the propionamide or the acetamide side chains of the corrin ring of the Cbl Molecule.
      <br/>
      When conjugated to the e-side chain, the Cbl-biotin complex binds well to transcobalimin II.
      <br/>
      The initial biotin-Cbl complex can be prepared according to Pathre, et al. (Pathre, P. M., et al., "Synthesis of Cobalamin-Biotin conjugates that vary in the position of cobalamin coupling, Evaluation of cobalamin derivative binding to transcobalamin II," incorporated by reference).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In addition to conjugation of the side chains of the corrin ring, conjugation to the Cbl moiety can also be made to the ribose moiety, phosphate moiety, and to the benzimidazole moiety.
      <br/>
      The conjugating agent and the drug to be conjugated depend upon the type of Cbl group that is modified and the nature of the drug and may have to standardize for each drug.

      In another embodiment, one may wish to deliver cobalamin to a patient's circulatory system.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment of the invention, one prepares a cobalamin-transcobalamin II complex, preferably by incubating TC II with Cbl.
      <br/>
      The unbound Cbl can be separated from the TC II-bound Cbl by adding albumin-coated charcoal.
      <br/>
      Following centrifugation, the free Cbl is always found in the charcoal pellet and the TC II-bound Cbl is present in the supernatant, which is then carefully taken out with a Pasteur pipette (see Gottlieb, C., et al., Blood 25:875-884, 1965).

    <p num="30">
      1.
      <br/>
      Cbl deficiency--Patients with inherited (absorption deficiency due to the absence of functional Cbl absorption proteins including IF, TC II and IFCR) or acquired (surgery) causes of Cbl deficiency can be treated orally with TC II-Cbl.
      <br/>
      Because TCII-R is expressed in the entire region of the gut (S.
      <br/>
      Bose, et al., Biochem. J. 310:923-929, 1995), the orally administered TC II-Cbl complex internalized from the luminal side will be transcytosed as an intact TC II-Cbl complex to the circulation (basolateral side) via a non-lysosomal pathway.
      <br/>
      The circulatory TC II-Cbl complex, once endocytosed by TCII-R expressed in the cell surface of all cells and tissue, will be targeted to lysosomes.
      <br/>
      In the lysosomes, TC II will be degraded and the free Cbl will be used by the cells for cellular metabolic reactions (S.
      <br/>
      Bose, et al., supra, 1997).
      <br/>
      This type of oral Cbl therapy will be highly beneficial for Cbl deficient patients, who at the present time are being regularly treated with high dosage of intramuscularly injected Cbl.
      <br/>
      2. Other disorders--This novel pathway can also be exploited to orally deliver therapeutic drugs to patients suffering from various disorders.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, a hydrophobic drug, such as a synthetic organic molecule, can be conjugated to the Cbl molecule.
      <br/>
      The Cbl-drug conjugate bound to TC II will be transcytosed to the circulation as an intact complex when it is presented orally.
      <br/>
      From the circulation, the complex (TC II-Cbl-drug) once endocytosed by all cells via TCII-R, will be targeted to lysosomes.
      <br/>
      In the lysosomes, following degradation of TC II, Cbl will be released from the drug intracellularly.
      <br/>
      The liberated drug can then act on its intracellular target molecules, once it is transported out of the lysosomes.
    </p>
    <p num="31">In another embodiment, a drug can be conjugated directly to the TC II molecule.</p>
    <p num="32">
      In order to successfully use this pathway for oral delivery of drugs to their intracellular targets, the following three factors have to be taken into consideration:
      <br/>
      a.
      <br/>
      Affinity of drug conjugated Cbl for TC II--Recently different organic molecules including biotin (P.
      <br/>
      Pathare, et al., Bioconjugate.
      <br/>
      Chem. 7:217-232, 1996) and arylstannyl (D.
      <br/>
      Wilbur, et al., Bioconjugate.
      <br/>
      Chem. 7:461-474, 1996) were successfully conjugated to the different functional groups of the Cbl molecule using a spacer arm.
      <br/>
      The results from these studies have also confirmed that conjugation at 5'-OH ribose moiety, cobalt metal center and in the e'-propionamide side chain of Cbl had little effect on binding of modified Cbl to TC II (P.
      <br/>
      Pathare, et al., supra, 1996; D. Wilbur, et al., supra, 1996; R. Bonnett, "Reactions of the Corrin Macrocycle," B12: Vol 1-Chemistry, pp. 201-243, Wiley, New York, 1982).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the drug of interest is preferably conjugated to these side groups of Cbl, so that it does not alter the affinity of modified Cbl for TC II.
      <br/>
      b. Binding affinity of TC II-Cbl-drug complex for TCII-R and the rate of its internalization--Bio-distribution studies (D.
      <br/>
      Wilbur, et al., supra, 1996) in mice using TC II complexed to radiolabelled Cbl that has been conjugated to different organic molecules at the sites mentioned above have demonstrated that there were no chances in the distribution of modified Cbl radioactivity in different organs, compared to control experiments.
      <br/>
      These studies have clearly shown that conjugated Cbl bound to TC II can be efficiently endocytosed by TCII-R expressed in all cells/tissues.
      <br/>
      c. Intracellular diconjugation of the complex--Earlier studies have shown that TC II-Cbl complex is targeted to lysosomes following its internalization by TCII-R.
      <br/>
      In the lysosomes, TC II is degraded and free Cbl is utilized by the cells.
      <br/>
      Because the rate of internalization of modified TC II-Cbl complex (TC II-Cbl-organic molecule conjugate) was shown not to be effected (discussed earlier), the TC II-Cbl-drug complex will also be targeted to lysosomes.
      <br/>
      In the acidic environment of the lysosomes and in the presence of proteolytic enzymes, the bond between the Cbl and the conjugated molecule will be cleaved.
      <br/>
      Earlier studies have demonstrated the intracellular cleavage of esterified conjugated molecule from Cbl by intracellular enzymes, including esterases (E.

      In order to examine TCII-R activity in Caco-2 cells as a function of cellular proliferation and differentiation, its activity was determined in cells that were grown on plastic for 3-12 days �FIG. 1�. FIG. 1 shows transcobalamin II-receptor activity during the growth and differentiation of Caco-2 cells.
      <br/>
      Caco-2 cells grown on plastic for 3-12 days were harvested and homogenized in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4 containing 140 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM PMSF. The homogenate was extracted with Triton X-100 (1%) and the supernatant was assayed for the binding of TC II-57 �Co�Cbl (2 pmol) according Seligman and Allen �13�. Each data point is the average of duplicate assays from two separate batch of cells grown for 3-12 days.

      In general the results varied by less than 5%.

      Total TCII-R activity in the cellular homogenate rose by about 5-fold (from 11-49 pmol) from day 3 to day 12 in culture.

      When the activity was expressed/mg of cellular protein, it rose by nearly 2.7-fold (2.7-7.2 pmol/mg protein).

      These results demonstrated that TCII-R activity in these cells is regulated during their differentiation and that the highest level of its expression occurred after reaching confluency.

      In order to examine whether TCII-R expressed in both surface domains is functional in mediating endocytosis, we used filter grown Caco-2 cells to study binding and uptake of the ligand.
      <br/>
      Cellular sorting of 57 �Co�Cbl bound to TC II--Filter grown cells were presented with the ligand, human TC II-57 �Co�Cbl on either the apical or basolateral cell surfaces.
      <br/>
      The ligand binding to cell surfaces at 5 (degree)  C. revealed a basolateral binding of .about.180 fmol/filter which was nearly 6-fold higher than the binding of .about.30 fmol/filter noted on the apical side �Table I�. The specificity of ligand binding was confirmed when pre-incubation of cells with TCII-R antiserum on either side completely abolished ligand binding (data not shown).
      <br/>
      When the cells were warmed to 37 (degree)  C. to allow for internalization of the ligand, within 60 minutes all the labeled Cbl had left both the apical and basolateral cell surfaces and 100% of 57 �Co�Cbl was found inside the cell �Table I�. However, 5 hours following internalization, nearly 100% of Cbl internalized from the basolateral side was still present inside the cell while, greater than 95% of Cbl internalized from the apical side had exited the cell and was found transcytosed to the basolateral medium.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      When the cells were pre-incubated with lysosomotropic agents, either chloroquine or leupeptin, the amount of 57 �Co�Cbl that was transcytosed to the basolateral side following apical internalization of TC II-57 �Co�Cbl was not inhibited.
      <br/>
      In contrast, lysosomotropic agents inhibited the intracellular 57 �Co�Cbl levels by nearly 65-70% following its basolateral entry and the inhibition was accompanied by increased 57 �Co�Cbl levels in the basolateral medium.
      <br/>
      Both in the absence or in the presence of lysosomotropic inhibitors, basolaterally internalized Cbl was never transcytosed to the apical side �Table I�. These results suggested that apically internalized 57 �Co�Cbl bound to TC II was transcytosed by a non-lysosomal pathway while, the basolaterally internalized 57 �Co�Cbl was retained in the cell and that the lysosomotropic agents, chloroquine and leupeptin inhibited the cellular retention of 57 �Co�Cbl.
      <br/>
      Immunoprecipitation of basolateral 57 �Co� Cbl with antiserum to human TC II revealed (Table II) that all the Cbl radioactivity (.about.28 fmol) present in the basolateral medium following apical internalization of human TC II-57 �Co�Cbl in the presence and absence of lysosomal inhibitors was immunoprecipitated.

      In contrast, &gt;than 90% of intracellular 57 �Co�Cbl (.about.172-180 fmol) following internalization of TC II-57 �Co�Cbl from the basolateral side could not be immunoprecipitated with antiserum to human TC II when the cells were incubated in the absence of lysosomal inhibitors �Table II�. However, in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors, 57 �Co�Cbl that was in the cell (55-65 fmol) and in the basolateral medium (120-124 fmol) was completely precipitated with human TC II antiserum �Table II�.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Although the apically presented 57 �Co�Cbl was completely transcytosed and was bound to TC II, it is not known whether the source of basolateral TC II is the internalizing exogenous TC II, or the endogenous Caco-2 cell TC II to which Cbl is transferred prior to transcytosis and following degradation of the exogenous internalizing TC II.
      <br/>
      To address this issue the following experiments were carried out.
      <br/>
      Our initial transcytosis studies using 57 �Co�Cbl bound to rabbit TC II revealed that all of labeled Cbl in the basolateral medium could be precipitated with antiserum to rabbit TC II but not with antiserum to human TC II (data not shown).
      <br/>
      Native TC II complexed with 57 �Co� Cbl from these two species can only be precipitated with their respective antiserum but not with antiserum raised to the other species �16�. Thus, this observation suggested that the source of TC II in the basolateral medium following apical internalization of TC II-Cbl is the exogenous TC II.
      <br/>
      In order to prove this directly, further transcytosis studies were carried out using 125 I-TC II-Cbl.

      While the apically internalized TC II-Cbl is transcytosed intact to the basolateral medium, the basolaterally internalized TC II-Cbl is processed by the lysosomes involving the degradation of TC II and the liberation of Cbl to be utilized by the cell.

    <p num="65">
      In the current studies we have used human intestinal derived epithelial Caco-2 cells to study TC II-mediated transport of Cbl.
      <br/>
      Caco-2 cells are well established cell model system and because of their high degree of differentiation they have been used extensively to study the biosynthesis and polarized delivery of functional proteins of brush border �17�. TCII-R total and specific activities �FIG. 1�, like that of IFCR �7�, alkaline phosphatase �18� and sucrase �17� rose as a function of differentiation of these cells.
      <br/>
      The bipolar expression and the basolateral enrichment of TCII-R noted in these cells �FIG. 3� is not an artifact of culture since isolated surface membranes from intact intestinal mucosa also exhibited this property �FIG. 2�.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Recent �4� studies from our laboratory have shown that TC II-57 �Co�Cbl internalized from the basolateral side of human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells is processed releasing Cbl to be utilized as coenzymes by these cells.
      <br/>
      In the current studies we show that following basolateral uptake of TC II-57 �Co�Cbl, TC II is degraded by lysosomal enzymes facilitating the liberated free Cbl to be utilized by the cells.
      <br/>
      Under normal physiological conditions, the dietary Cbl present on the lumenal side bound to gastric intrinsic factor is transcytosed via IFCR in both the intact intestine �11, 19� and in Caco-2 cells �7, 20, 21� and other polarized epithelial cells �22-25�. During intrinsic factor-mediated apical to basolateral transcytosis of Cbl, intrinsic factor is degraded by leupeptin sensitive protease and Cbl is bound to transcobalamin II prior to its exit on the basolateral side �23-25�. Since all the Cbl internalized bound to IF from the apical side (luminal) of polarized epithelial cells is eventually transcytosed, these cells must obtain Cbl from endogenous sources and our current and recent �4� studies demonstrate that the basolateral TCII-R facing the circulation may facilitate such an uptake from the circulation.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The results of the current studies have also shown that the apical TCII-R expressed in Caco-cells �Table I and FIG. 4� and in the rat intestine �FIG. 5� is functional in mediating endocytosis of TC II-Cbl.
      <br/>
      The functional significance of apical endocytosis of TC II-Cbl and its eventual transcytosis by the non-lysosomal pathway in the gastrointestinal absorption of dietary/biliary Cbl is not known.
      <br/>
      It is highly unlikely that Cbl transport bound to TC II occurs physiologically bypassing the well accepted IF/IFCR pathway of Cbl transport �26� for the following two reasons: One, TC II, the ligand has never been detected in the gastrointestinal lumen despite the recent finding of relatively high levels of TC II mRNA in human pancreas �27�. However, it is not known whether TC II like IF in some species �28� is secreted from the pancreas and mediate luminal uptake of Cbl via TCII-R.
      <br/>
      Two, patients with inherited disorders �29, 30� of IF or IFCR develop Cbl deficiency, suggesting that IF/IFCR mediated Cbl transport system is the only physiologically operational intestinal uptake system for Cbl transport in man.
      <br/>
      Despite its lack of importance in the normal uptake of dietary Cbl, it is possible that apical TCII-R can mediate uptake of TC II-Cbl when presented orally, particularly in patients who malabsorb Cbl due to several inherited disorders �29, 30� or to surgical procedures such as gastrectomy and ileal resection �31�. A child who malabsorbed Cbl due to inherited TC II deficiency responded well in Schilling test �32� (which measures Cbl absorption) when the child was orally fed with Cbl complexed to TC II.
      <br/>
      Further studies are needed to test the usefulness of the apical uptake of TC II-Cbl if any, in Vitamin B12 absorption disorders.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Based on previous �7, 20-25� and the current studies several interesting questions arise regarding the mechanism of Cbl sorting when internalized bound to IF or TC II in a polarized epithelial cell.
      <br/>
      These include a) how are these cells able to distinguish between Cbl internalized apically bound to IF or basolaterally bound to TC II to either export Cbl (transcytose) out of the cell or import it into the cell, respectively? In addition, what vesicular fusion events favor lysosomal degradation of both IF and TC II when internalized from the opposite side of these cells? and b) how do these cells process the same ligand TC II, by both the non-lysosomal and lysosomal pathways following its internalization from the apical and the basolateral domains, respectively? The cellular mechanism/s by which Caco-2 cells are able to mediate these sorting events is not known.
      <br/>
      Possible explanations for the lysosomal processing of IF or the non-lysosomal processing of TC II during apical to basolateral transcytosis of Cbl may be that it is due to a) endocytosis by two separate receptors, IFCR and TCII-R, respectively or b) due to the differences in the nature of the internalizing ligands, glycoprotein (IF) �33� vs nonglycoprotein (TC II) �34�.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      One observation of interest in Caco-2 cells is that endogenously synthesized �7� or exogenously derived TC II from the apical domain �FIG. 4� or exogenous TC II derived from the basolateral side whose lysosomal degradation is inhibited is secreted to the basolateral side.
      <br/>
      Even the degradation product of basolaterally derived TC II is secreted to the basolateral side.
      <br/>
      Thus, it seems that TC II, irrespective of its initial vesicular location in the cell, is targeted for basolateral secretion in these cells and perhaps in the absorptive enterocytes.
      <br/>
      The basolateral exit of TC II-Cbl in Caco-2 cells does not need TCII-R as the apical to basolateral transcytosis of TC II-Cbl occurred even when the basolateral TCII-R was inactivated with its antiserum during these experiments to ensure that the transcytosed TC II-Cbl does not re-enter the cell.
      <br/>
      The processing of TC II by two separate pathways depending on the side of internalization noted in this study may be related to the differences in the nature of the initial endocytic vesicles derived from the opposite sides of the cell or to differences in the later fusion events.
      <br/>
      Further studies are needed to define the nature of transporting vesicles and vesicular fusion events involved in the segregation of TC II taken up from the opposite side of these cells.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Based on our previous �4� and current findings we propose a model �FIG. 6� for the TC II-mediated vectorial movement of Cbl into and out of polarized epithelial cells.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 is the proposed sorting pathways of TC II and Cbl in Caco-2 cells-Proposed pathways are indicated by broken lines.

      More established pathways are indicated by full lines.
      <br/>
      TC II internalized bound to Cbl from the apical side (.tangle-solidup.) and the basolateral side (.circle-solid.) is shown.
      <br/>
      The role of lysosomotropic agents, chloroquine and leupeptin on the degradation of basolaterally derived TC II and the resulting transport out of the lysosomes into the cytosol for conversion to MeCbl and AdoCbl is indicated by Block 1.
      <br/>
      The lysosomal transporter �35� which is thought to a play a role in the transfer of free Cbl from the lysosomes to the cytosol is indicated by a dark oval.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Based on this model, polarized epithelial cells, such as absorptive enterocytes derive Cbl for their intracellular utilization as Cbl coenzymes from the circulation bound to plasma TC II via TCII-R expressed in the basolateral membranes.
      <br/>
      The basolaterally derived TC II-Cbl is processed via lysosomes and free Cbl formed due to TC II degradation is transported out of the lysosomes for conversion to and utilization as Cbl coenzymes.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, apical TCII-R when presented with TC II-Cbl is able to transcytose both Cbl and TC II across the cell.
      <br/>
      Further studies are needed to test the validity of this proposal in other intestinal and renal polarized epithelial cells.
