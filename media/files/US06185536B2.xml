    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Unauthorized use of telecommunications subscriber units costs the telecommunications industry very significant annual revenue losses.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, this industry is continually attempting to come up with more effective subscriber authentication measures.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is known in the telecommunications art to require the subscriber to enter a Personal Identification Number (PIN) for every subscriber unit call.
      <br/>
      However, this type of authentication system is susceptible to eavesdropping by unauthorized users who can capture the PIN and use it to make unauthorized calls.
      <br/>
      Moreover, requiring the subscriber to use a PIN imposes a burden on the subscriber, who already can have an excess of passwords and PINs to keep track of for access to various equipment and systems.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another known approach to the problem of unauthorized calls is to require the subscriber to use a Subscriber Information Module (SIM) card containing the PIN.
      <br/>
      However, SIM cards can be lost, stolen, forgotten, or misplaced.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Thus, what is needed are an improved user-authentication system and method for granting subscriber unit access only to authorized subscribers of a communication system.</p>
    <p num="8">Also needed is an improved communication system which does not require the subscriber to use a SIM card or enter a PIN number before using the subscriber unit.</p>
    <p num="9">Further needed is an improved communication system which allows multiple subscribers to have access to a single subscriber unit without using SIM cards or entering PIN numbers.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="11">
      The present invention provides, among other things, a system and method for establishing a communication link using user-specific voice data parameters as a user discriminator.
      <br/>
      In a further and more specific aspect, the invention employs user-specific voice data parameters for inhibiting unauthorized use of a communication unit in a communication system.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes a stored speech characteristic model (SCM) vocoder to generate a subscriber's unique speech parameters.
      <br/>
      As will be explained in greater detail below, this vocoder uses a pre-stored speech characteristic model (SCM) table and input stimulus table containing entries from a registered subscriber.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term "registered user" means a user or subscriber who has an SCM table or database and an input stimulus table pre-stored in the communication system.
      <br/>
      The term is not meant to refer to user registration for the purposes of billing.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The SCM table and input stimulus table can be stored within a communication unit (CU) or an external storage device (e.g., a User Information Card (UIC) or a control facility memory device).
      <br/>
      As used herein, a "transmit vocoder" is a vocoder that encodes speech samples, and a "receive vocoder" is a vocoder that decodes the speech.
      <br/>
      The transmit vocoder or the receive vocoder can be located within a CU or in a control facility that provides service to telephones which do not have vocoder equipment.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Details of the SCM vocoder are explained in the above-identified Related Invention.
      <br/>
      During call setup, the SCM table and input stimulus table for the transmit vocoder user are sent to the receive vocoder to be used in the decoding process.
      <br/>
      During the call, the speech from the transmit vocoder user is characterized by determining table entries which most closely match the subscriber's speech.
      <br/>
      Information describing these table entries is sent to the receive vocoder.
      <br/>
      Although the method and apparatus of the invention are described using SCM tables and input stimulus tables, other user-customized tables used to characterize speech are encompassed within the scope of the description and claims.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The system and method of providing user-specific access to a communication system using user-specific voice data or SCMs as a user discriminator to facilitate user-specific authorized access to a communication system is set forth in the figures and the accompanying description.
      <br/>
      In general, the method involves providing user-specific voice data, preferably in the form of a user-specific SCM database, a subscriber subsequently generating a voice sound to access a CU, granting the subscriber access to the CU to establish a communication link if the subsequently generated voice sound matches, correlates or is otherwise comparable with user-specific voice data, and denying the subscriber access to the CU if the subsequently generated voice sound is incomparable with the user-specific voice data.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The purpose of the invention is to inhibit unauthorized use of a CU.
      <br/>
      The determination of whether a subscriber is an authorized user, carried out through a process called "authorization training", is made by virtue of algorithms which operate to compare an SCM of the subscriber's voice with a database of user-specific SCM parameters developed by the subscriber through a process called "connection training".
      <br/>
      If the SCM developed from the initial stages of a typical call establishment is not comparable with an inventory of stored user-specific SCM parameters, the call is considered "unauthorized", and the connection request is denied.
      <br/>
      An exception to this is a request for certain emergency calls such as a request for a 911 connection.
    </p>
    <p num="17">This authorization approach, when used for every call, does not require the subscriber to always enter a personal-identification-number (PIN), thereby making it less susceptible to eavesdropping methods that focus on capturing the PIN and using it to make unauthorized calls.</p>
    <p num="18">
      The authorization training is enabled by the use of a Subscriber Identification (SID) which can be furnished to a subscriber by a service provider and kept private by the subscriber.
      <br/>
      The SID is normally on a UIC supplied by the service provider and is used only to initiate connection training.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 1 illustrates a communication system 10 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      Communication system 10 includes Mobile Communication Units 12 (MCUs), satellites 14, Control Facility 20 (CF), Public Switched Telephone Network 24 (PSTN), conventional telephone 26, and Fixed CU 28 (FCU).
      <br/>
      As used herein, where both MCUs 12 and FCUs 28 perform the same functions, the general term Communication Unit (CU) will be used.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      MCUs 12 can be, for example, cellular telephones or radios adapted to communicate with satellites 14 over radio-frequency (RF) communication links 16.
      <br/>
      FCUs 28 can be telephone units linked directly with PSTN 24 which have attached or portable handsets.
      <br/>
      Unlike conventional telephone 26, CUs 12 and 28 include vocoder devices for compressing speech data.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, CUs 12 and 28 also include a User Information Card (UIC) interface.
      <br/>
      This interface allows a CU subscriber to swipe or insert a UIC containing information unique to the subscriber.
      <br/>
      A UIC can be, for example, a magnetic strip card.
      <br/>
      The UIC contains one or more user identification numbers, SCM tables, and input stimulus tables which are loaded into the vocoding process.
      <br/>
      By using a UIC, a user can load his or her user-unique vocoding information, in the form of encoding information tables, into any CU.
      <br/>
      CUs 12 and 28 are described in more detail in conjunction with FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Satellites 14 can be low-earth, medium-earth, or geostationary satellites.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, satellites 14 are low-earth orbit satellites which communicate with each other over inter-satellite link 18.
      <br/>
      Thus, a call from a first CU 12, 28 that is serviced by a first satellite 14 can be routed directly through one or more satellites over links 18 to a second CU 12, 28 serviced by a second satellite 14.
      <br/>
      In an alternative embodiment, satellites 14 can be part of a "bent pipe" system, i.e. a system in which satellites do not communicate with one another but rather function as transponders with respect to terrestrial-based transceivers.
      <br/>
      Satellites 14 route data packets received from CUs 12, CF 20, and other communication devices (not shown).
      <br/>
      Satellites 14 communicate with CF 20 over link 22.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      CF 20 is a device which provides an interface between satellites 14 and a terrestrial telephony apparatus, such as PSTN 24, which provides telephone service to conventional telephone 26 and FCU 28.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, CF 20 includes a vocoder which enables CF 20 to decode encoded speech signals before sending the speech signals through PSTN 24 to conventional telephone 26.
      <br/>
      Because FCU 28 includes its own vocoder, the vocoder located within CF 20 does not need to decode the encoded speech signals destined for FCU 28.
      <br/>
      CF 20 is described in more detail in conjunction with FIG. 4.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As described above, in a preferred embodiment a user's SCM table and input stimulus table are stored on a UIC.
      <br/>
      In an alternative embodiment, the SCM table and input stimulus table are stored in a CU memory device.
      <br/>
      In another alternative embodiment, CF 20 includes a memory device in which SCM tables and input stimulus tables are stored for registered subscribers.
      <br/>
      During call setup, a CF that has the registered subscriber's tables in storage sends the SCM table and input stimulus table to both the transmit vocoder and the receive vocoder.

      FIG. 2 illustrates a communication system 40 in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      Communication system 40 includes MCUs 42, CFs 44, PSTN 50, conventional telephone 52, and FCU 54.
      <br/>
      MCUs 42 can be, for example, cellular telephones or radios adapted to communicate with CFs 44 over RF links 46.
      <br/>
      CUs 42 and 54 include a vocoder device for compressing speech data.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, CUs 42 and 54 also include a UIC interface.
      <br/>
      CUs 42 and 54 are described in more detail in conjunction with FIG. 3.

    <p num="26">
      CF 44 is a device which provides an interface between MCUs 42 and a terrestrial telephony apparatus, such as PSTN 50 which provides telephone service to conventional telephone 52 and FCU 54.

      In addition, CF 44 can perform call setup functions and other system control functions.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, CF 44 includes a vocoder which enables CF 44 to decode encoded speech signals before sending the speech signals through PSTN 50 to conventional telephone 52.

      Multiple CFs 44 can be linked together using link 48 which can be a radio-frequency (RF) or hard-wired link.

    <p num="30">
      FIG. 3 illustrates a CU 60 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      CU 60 can be either an MCU (e.g., MCU 12, FIG. 1) or an FCU (e.g., FCU 28, FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      CU 60 includes vocoder processor 62, memory device 64, speech input device 66, and audio output device 74.
      <br/>
      Memory device 64 is used to store SCM tables and input stimulus tables for use by vocoder processor 62.
      <br/>
      Speech input device 66 is used to collect speech samples from the subscriber of CU 60.
      <br/>
      Speech samples are encoded by vocoder processor 62 during a call, and they also are used to generate the SCM tables and input stimulus tables during a training procedure.
      <br/>
      Audio output device 74 is used to output decoded speech.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      It may be helpful to the reader at this point for vocoder processor 62 to be described in more detail. "Voice coders", referred to commonly as "vocoders", compress and decompress speech data.
      <br/>
      Advanced, low-rate vocoders allow a digital communication system to increase the number of system communication channels by decreasing the bandwidth allocated to each channel, because they reduce the number of bits required for transmission of intelligible digitized speech.
      <br/>
      Fundamentally, a vocoder implements specialized signal processing techniques to analyze or compress speech data at an analysis device and synthesize or decompress the speech data at a synthesis device.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Speech data compression typically involves parametric analysis techniques, whereby the fundamental or "basis" elements of the speech signal are extracted.
      <br/>
      These extracted basis elements are encoded and sent to the synthesis device in order to provide for reduction in the amount of transmitted or stored data.
      <br/>
      At the synthesis device, the basis elements can be used to reconstruct an approximation of the original speech signal.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      With CELP-type ("Code Excited Linear Prediction") vocoders, the encoder estimates a speaker's speech characteristics, and it calculates the approximate pitch.
      <br/>
      The vocoder also characterizes the "residual" underlying the speech by comparing the residual in the speech frame with a table containing pre-stored residual samples.
      <br/>
      An index to the closest-fitting residual sample, coefficients describing the speech characteristics, and the pitch are packed into a bitstream and sent to the decoder.
      <br/>
      The decoder extracts the index, coefficients, and pitch from the bitstream and simulates the frame of speech.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In a preferred embodiment, CU 60 also includes User Information Card (UIC) interface 76.
      <br/>
      As described previously, a subscriber can insert or swipe a UIC through UIC interface 76, enabling the subscriber's unique SCM table and input stimulus table to be loaded into memory device 64.
      <br/>
      In alternative embodiments, the subscriber's unique SCM table and input stimulus table are pre-stored in memory device 64 or in a CF (e.g., CF 20, FIG. 1).

      In summary, the invention provides a system and method which inhibits unauthorized access to a communication system by using user-specific voice data parameters as a user discriminator.
      <br/>
      The method and system is very secure and precludes the need for PINs or any per-call manual "passwording".
      <br/>
      Furthermore, should a subscriber wish to extend the authorized use of his or her communication unit to other subscribers, the SID can be used to initiate an authorization sequence for one or more additional subscribers.
      <br/>
      In this regard, the UIC, CIJ or CF would then maintain a complete set of a plurality of authorized SCMs for that SID, any one of which, when correlating with the SCM developed from the authorization training, discussed in combination with FIGS. 8-10, enables the call establishment sequence to continue.
    </p>
    <p num="65">Additionally, should an unauthorized person attempt to use another subscriber's CU, the normal SCM connection training generates the subscriber's SCM which, when compared with the SCM database of authorized callers stored in the UIC, CU or CF, fails to correlate, and the call establishment procedure terminates.</p>
    <p num="66">
      Consistent with the teachings of the invention, after a communication link has been established during an authorization training sequence at steps 215, 245 and 266 in FIGS. 8-10, respectively, the CU and/or the CF can be employed for monitoring, either periodically or continually, the subscriber's voice and comparing the subscriber's voice with stored authorized SCM parameters during the call to verify that an authorized user is using the CU throughout the duration of the call.
      <br/>
      If an authorized user were to take the CU from the user and start speaking into the CU, the CU and/or CF would terminate the call.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Furthermore, and over time, the CU and/or the CF can also be employed for either periodically or continually monitoring one or more authorized user's voices to continually update authorized SCM parameters.
      <br/>
      In this regard, the algorithms governing the operation of the connection training sequences and authorization training sequences can be customized in accordance with specific needs of an authorized user or authorized users.
