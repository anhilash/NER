    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a semiconductor having a band gap of a mixed crystal formed of a III-V compound semiconductor other than nitride and III-nitrogen compound semiconductor by varying a laminated structure of a super lattice of an atomic layer of the III-V compound semiconductor other than nitride and III-nitrogen compound semiconductor, and relates to a semiconductor device using the same.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      A blue luminescent device has been studied by using a semiconductor made from a group II-VI, SiC and gallium nitride (GaN) system.
      <br/>
      Recently, it has been reported that a GaN compound semiconductor exhibits an excellent luminescence at room temperature, and a blue LED using the same has also been developed.
      <br/>
      Gallium nitride is a material having a band gap of 3.4 eV at room temperature and capable of emitting an ultraviolet light.
      <br/>
      In view of the characteristics of GaN, an attempt at using a mixed crystal of GaN and III-V group compound semiconductor which has a small band gap with GaN has been made by changing the molar fraction of the mixed crystal to obtain a blue luminescence.
      <br/>
      In addition, Appl.
      <br/>
      Phys. Lett. (vol. 63, (1993) 3470) discloses a method for changing an energy level generated in a quantum well layer by using a superlattice structure in the case where a system having the same crystalline structure such as GaAs--AlAs and GaN--AlN is employed, thereby changing a wavelength of luminescence of the quantum well layer.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      InN, having the same crystalline structure as GaN, is often used as a material to form a mixed crystal with GaN for obtaining a blue luminescence.
      <br/>
      Recently, a mixed crystal formed of GaN and a III-V group compound semiconductor other than nitride has been intensively studied.
      <br/>
      In such a study, attention has been focused on a mixed crystal of GaP1-x Nx or GaAs1-x Nx which is formed of GaN and GaP or GaAs (GaP and GaAs have a band gap of 2.78 eV and 1.42 eV ( GAMMA  point), respectively) because a blue luminescent material can be obtained by changing a molar fraction of the mixed crystal.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      For example, FIG. 14 shows a schematic view of GaP1-x Nx mixed crystal.
      <br/>
      As shown in the figure, GaP1-x Nx mixed crystal is formed by alternatively laminating a Ga surface 1 and a P1-x Nx surface 6.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Although GaP1-x Nx and GaAs1-x Nx have the above described characteristics, they have a great miscibility gap because a crystalline structure of GaN is different from GaP and GaAs (i.e., GaN has a wurtzite structure and GaP and GaAs have a zincblende structure) and the lattice mismatch is as great as 20%.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in the case of GaP1-x Nx, the obtained mixed crystal is limited to those having a molar fraction of x &lt;= 0.076 and x &gt;= 0.91 and in case of GaAs1-x Nx, to those having a molar fraction of x &lt;= 0.016 (see Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. Vol. 31 (1992) 3791, Appl.
      <br/>
      Phys. Lett. Vol. 63 (1993) 3506, Appl.
      <br/>
      Phys. Lett. Vol. 62 (1993) 1396).
      <br/>
      As a result, a compound semiconductor and a luminescent device having a desired band gap has not been realized in the form of a mixed crystal.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">A specific example of a combination used for a first monoatomic layer of the present invention includes AlP, GaP, InP, AlAs, GaAs, InAs, AlSb, GaSb and InSb.</p>
    <p num="14">A specific example of a combination used for a second monoatomic layer of the present invention includes AlN, GaN and InN.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The present invention may be a structure having only the first monoatomic layer or only the second monoatomic layer.
      <br/>
      However, the combination of the first and the second monoatomic layers are preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="16">A preferable combination of the first and second monoatomic layers are GaP and GaN, AlP and GaN, GaAs and GaN, GaSb and GaN, and AlAs and GaN.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The total number of lamination of the first and second monoatomic layers constituting a laminated superlattice structure comprising the III-V compound semiconductor is at least 2 depending on the type of atomic layer to be used, preferably 2 to 50,000, more preferably 2 to 1,000.
      <br/>
      The first and the second monoatomic layers are regularly laminated to constitute a lattice unit.
      <br/>
      Examples of cases where the lattice unit is not specified are the combinations of 2 second monoatomic layers, 1 first monoatomic layer and 5 second monoatomic layers; 6 second monoatomic layers and 2 first monoatomic layers; 1 second monoatomic layer, 1 first monoatomic layer, 5 second monoatomic layers and 1 first monoatomic layer; 7 second monatomic layers and 1 first monoatomic layer; and 4 second monoatomic layers, 1 first monoatomic layer and 5 second monoatomic layers.
    </p>
    <p num="18">In the above described lattice unit, a preferred ratio of the second monoatomic layer to the whole monoatomic layers is 80 to 99.9%. Conventionally, a mixed crystal comprising the lattice unit having the ratio in the range above was not able to be grown.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The monoatomic layers may be prepared preferably by using the Molecular Organometallic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) method, Atomic Layer Epitaxy (ALE) method or Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) method.
      <br/>
      When the MOCVD is used, the following materials are used for forming the monoatomic layer: trimethylgallium (TMG), triethylgallium (TEG) etc. for Ga materials; phosphine (PH3), tert-butyl phosphine etc. for P materials; arsine (AsH3), tert-butyl arsine etc. for As materials; trimethylalminum (TMA), triethylalminum etc. for Al materials; and ammonia (NH3), dimethylhydrazine (DMHy), azide compounds etc. for N materials.
      <br/>
      When the MBE method is used, N materials may be a nitrogen plasma source.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Generally, the semiconductor of the present invention may be formed on a substrate to provide a semiconductor device.
      <br/>
      The substrate used for the device of the present invention is not specifically limited.
      <br/>
      For example, a gallium substrate such as GaP, GaAs and GaSb, an indium substrate such as InP, InAs and InSb, a metal oxide substrate such as MgO and NdGaO3, and a sapphire substrate and the like may be used.
      <br/>
      The substrate may have a conductivity of n type or p type.
      <br/>
      Examples of an impurity doped to the n type substrate are Si, Se, S and the like, and those doped to the p type substrate are Mg, Zn, Be and the like.
      <br/>
      Incidentally, the impurities described above may be doped to the first and/or the second monatomic layers.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A buffer layer may be laminated on the substrate for preventing a crystal structure of the first and the second monoatomic layers from being affected in the crystal structure of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The buffer layer is preferably the same type as the monoatomic layer on the substrate side of the III-V compound semiconductor.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the buffer layer is in the range from 0.005  MU m to 0.1  MU m. The MOCVD method or MBE method may be used for forming the buffer layer.
      <br/>
      Further, the buffer layer may have a conductivity of n type or p type.
      <br/>
      In the case of the MOCVD, when the buffer layer is formed of silicon, silane (SiH4) is used as a dopant to give n type conductivity, and when it is formed of Se and S, H2 Se and H2 S are used to give n type conductivity.
      <br/>
      When the buffer layer is formed of magnesium, cyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp2 Mg) is used as a dopant to give the p type conductivity, and when it is formed of Zn, DEZn is used.
      <br/>
      In the case of MBE, Si, S, Se, Zn and Be may be used as it is as a material.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The device of the present invention may be a luminescent device.
      <br/>
      Following is a detailed description for the luminescent device.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The luminescent device comprises a cladding layer (a first cladding layer), an active layer and a cladding layer (a second layer), in which at least one of the cladding layer and the active layer is formed of the III-V compound semiconductor.</p>
    <p num="24">
      When the III-V compound semiconductor is used as a lattice unit in the luminescent device, one or more lattice units are formed in at least one of the cladding layers and the active layer.

      In the following description, those in which a lattice unit is formed in the active layer refer to a superlattice active layer, and those in which a lattice unit is formed in the cladding layer refer to a superlattice cladding layer.

    <p num="25">
      As the first cladding layer, a known cladding layer having a thickness of 100 nm to 10,000 nm may be used.
      <br/>
      Examples of the known cladding layers include Alx Ga1-x N layer (0 to 0.01 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.35 to 0.4), GaN, Inx Ga1-x N and the like.

      In addition, the first superlattice cladding layer formed of the III-V compound semiconductor described above may be used as the first cladding layer.

      <br/>
      The band gap of the first cladding layer is preferably greater than that of the active layer because carriers are efficiently implanted to the active layer.

      A preferable band gap of the active layer is in the range from 2.2 to 3.2 eV. The known active layer may be formed, for example, by mixing crystals, while the superlattice active layer may be formed by the known MOCVD or MBE method.

      FIGS. 1 and 2 show the monoatomic layer laminated superlattice structure by illustrating the GaP/GaN monoatomic layer superlattice in which 8 atomic layers are laminated in the &lt;001&gt; orientation.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a schematic view showing GaP in which 8 layers are laminated in the &lt;001&gt; orientation.
      <br/>
      As the GaP has the zincblende type structure, Ga surface 1 and P surface 2 are alternatively present in &lt;001&gt; orientation.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, two P surfaces 2 in FIG. 1 are replaced with N surfaces 3, in which GaP is used for the first monoatomic layer and the zincblende GaN is used for the second monoatomic layer.
      <br/>
      The monoatomic superlattice structure shown in FIG. 2 comprises 6 first monoatomic layers, 2 second monatomic layers, 1 first monoatomic layer, 2 second monoatomic layer, 3 first monoatomic layers, 1 second monoatomic layer, and 2 first monoatomic layers in this order.
      <br/>
      If 8 monatomic layers in FIG. 2 is considered to be a lattice unit, the ratio of P to N is 3:1, which is the same PN ratio as a GaN0.25 PO0.75 mixed crystal.
      <br/>
      The PN ratio may be changed by varying the monoatomic superlattice structure by changing the number of the surfaces to be replaced to N surface 3 shown in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The black dots in FIG. 3 refer to the results of a calculation of the orbit mutual interaction by a strong binding method using until the second approximation to show a band gap of the GaP/GaN pseudo monoatomic superlattice in which 8 atomic layers are laminated in the &lt;001&gt; orientation.
      <br/>
      The horizontal axis of FIG. 3 is the number of GaN monoatomic layers/the number of (GaN+GaP) monoatomic layers.
      <br/>
      The reason why the band gap has a plurality of values in the same composition is that there exists a plurality of combinations for the arrangement of GaP and GaN monoatomic layers.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the solid line shown in FIG. 3 is the result of a calculation of band gap of the GaP1-x Nx mixed crystal.
      <br/>
      The horizontal axis for the solid line is the fraction ratio of N in GaP1-x Nx.
      <br/>
      Although there exist a plurality of band gaps depending on the arrangement of GaP and GaN monoatomic layers, it is seen that the band gap of the GaP/GaN pseudo monoatomic superlattice is almost the same as that of the GaP1-x Nx mixed crystal.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a GaP/GaN monoatomic layer superlattice having a band gap of GaP1-x Nx, which conventionally has not been grown as a mixed crystal can be obtained by varying an arrangement by changing the number of lattice units of the GaP/GaN pseudo monoatomic superlattice.
      <br/>
      The technique of the present invention can be applied not only to the GaP/GaN and GaAs/GaN systems but also to any III-V compound semiconductor other than a nitride/III-nitride compound system.
    </p>
    <p num="36">In addition, if the superlattice active layer and/or the superlattice cladding layer in which a plurality of the lattice units described above are laminated regularly are formed in the luminescent device, a band gap suitable for emitting a blue light can be given to the active layer and the cladding layer.</p>

      For example, the same effect can be obtained by laminating less than 10 lattice units to form a thin LED, or by laminating more than 10 units, such as 20 and 30 units to form a thick LED.
      <br/>
      The number of units to be laminated (the thickness of the device) may be defined in view of the combination with other layers.

      According to the present invention, it is possible to provide the III-V compound semiconductor having a laminated superlattice structure with a band gap similar to the mixed crystal comprising the III-V compound semiconductor other than nitride and the III-nitride compound semiconductor, which had not been realized as a mixed crystal of the III-nitrogen compound semiconductor having a high mixed crystal ratio.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the luminescent device comprising the III-V compound semiconductor having the laminated superlattice structure as the active layer and/or cladding layer readily emits a blue light which was conventionally difficult to obtain.
