      A hygienic toothpaste dispenser comprises a main body member having a plurality of tubular spouts (27, 28, and 29), from which an individual can dispense toothpaste from his or her own personally assigned tubular spout permanently marked by indicia (30), thereby providing a sanitary delivery system.
      <br/>
      This dispenser has a main body with a base (23) for connection to a toothpaste container (20), either directly or via an adapter (FIG. 10), and tubular spouts with caps (31) for delivery of the paste.
      <br/>
      Additional dispenser embodiments (FIGS. 8A, 8B, and 9) are shown.
      <br/>
      Also additional adapter embodiments (FIGS. 11A, 11B, 11C, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17) show various means of connection between various types of toothpaste container tubular spouts and the various types of bases of the main body of the dispenser.
      <br/>
      Several dispensers may be connected together (FIG. 4), providing almost an unlimited number of assignable tubular spouts, limited only by a reasonable length and a reasonable width.
      <br/>
      The dispenser's structure provides a notch or notch and groove (38) to hang the dispenser and toothpaste container.
      <br/>
      This dispenser incorporates a removable one-way valve (33) and (34) that can automatically eliminate pull-back contamination.
      <br/>
      The dispenser and toothpaste container can be manufactured, with or without a check-valve, as one unit (FIG. 18).

      <br/>
      Field of Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention pertains to a dispenser, specifically for dispensing paste-like material, such as toothpaste, in a hygienic manner to a plurality of users.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Prior-art</p>
    <p num="4">
      It has long been recognized that multiple users contaminate the tip of a toothpaste tube.
      <br/>
      Now with thinner brands of toothpaste, the interior of the toothpaste container becomes exposed to germs when the toothpaste is drawn back inside the tube.
      <br/>
      The shape of most toothpaste containers is that of a round cylinder.
      <br/>
      The toothpaste container is often laid on or about the edge of the sink while the user is brushing his or her teeth.
      <br/>
      The laying of the container in this damp area increases its exposure to germs.
      <br/>
      Because of the shape, the container often slides off on the floor or into the sink, exposing itself to more germs.
    </p>
    <p num="5">There are many different types of dispensers for dispensing a substance through a plurality of tubular spouts.</p>
    <p num="6">
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,591,053 to Thomas (1971) shows a sanitary toothpaste dispenser that is threadably attached to a toothpaste tube.
      <br/>
      It dispenses through a plurality of nozzles or tubular spouts, spaced apart and provided with caps.
      <br/>
      Toothpaste can be selectively dispensed from each of the tubular spouts onto a toothbrush by removing an individual cap, squeezing the tube, and allowing the paste to flow out of the designated tube.
      <br/>
      Certain tubular spouts are made of different lengths so as to be able to assign a certain tubular spout to a specific individual.
      <br/>
      In addition, the various caps may be of different colors.
      <br/>
      This dispenser has five tubular spouts but only three different lengths.
      <br/>
      This causes confusion when the caps are removed.
      <br/>
      The caps may be identified by color but there is no way to associate caps with their respective spouts.
      <br/>
      It does not appear to be able to connect two or more dispensers together or expand to handle a larger number than it is designed.
      <br/>
      The paste can also return into the container after use, causing cross contamination between users.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,505,337 to Littman (1996) shows a hygienic toothpaste dispenser for selectively distributing toothpaste onto a toothbrush from one of a plurality of tubular spouts oriented to form a stand for a toothpaste container shaped as a cylinder, the tubular spouts being capped with snap-type covers.
      <br/>
      The tubular spouts have peelable indicia to identify with respective users.
      <br/>
      The toothpaste dispenser serves as a stand in the shape of a tripod with legs that curve outwardly and upwardly.
      <br/>
      The stand holds the toothpaste container vertically and uses gravity to dispense toothpaste from the tubular spout.
      <br/>
      This stand can have any number of tubular spouts or legs and it must rest on a flat surface.
      <br/>
      The base of the stand is small compared to overall height of the dispenser and tube.
      <br/>
      This combined unit of dispenser and tube is top heavy and easy to topple over, especially with the squeezing and changing of the shape and weight.
      <br/>
      The size of this dispenser is too big and takes up too much space.
      <br/>
      The peelable discs could come off.
      <br/>
      This dispenser is not expandable.
      <br/>
      The curved tubular spouts are not conducive to connecting dispensers together.
      <br/>
      This dispenser has curved tubular spouts and the interior of the dispenser is subdivided into chambers (determined by the number of tubular spouts) by a plurality of vertically extending divider plates whose inner ends intersect at the center of the cylinder.
      <br/>
      So to increase the number of tubular spouts the cylinder would have to be subdivided into smaller and smaller chambers.
      <br/>
      This complicates its ability to too increase the number of tubular spouts.
      <br/>
      It does not have a way to prevent the paste from returning to the tube.
      <br/>
      If a cap is left off, gravity may cause non-viscous toothpaste to ooze out of the tubular spout and down the side.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Neither of these show a dispenser that is expandable for a large number of users.
      <br/>
      A manufacturer would have to make the dispensers with various numbers of tubular spouts and carry large supplies of inventory of these various sizes.
      <br/>
      For example, a manufacturer of either of these devices would have to manufacture dispensers with many combinations of numbers of tubular spouts to satisfy the various sizes of the family unit, or the customer would have to purchase several of these dispensers to satisfy the size of his or her family.
      <br/>
      Additionally, he or she would need to purchase a container of toothpaste for each of these dispensers.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Several dispensers have been devised for delivering a product or products through multiple chambers.
      <br/>
      Thomas' and Littman's previously mentioned inventions, are the only dispensers that dispense toothpaste through multiple chambers and thus are the closest related prior-art.
      <br/>
      Recent developments in the composition of some toothpaste have created a paste with a thinner texture.
      <br/>
      This thinner texture has created a problem with squeeseable toothpaste tubes.
      <br/>
      The thinner toothpaste, once squeezed out of the container, tends to pull back into the tube.
      <br/>
      This is caused by the container trying to return to its original shape.
      <br/>
      It creates a suction that is greater than the resistance of the paste.
      <br/>
      This suction pulls the thinner toothpaste back into the container, causing contamination to occur.
      <br/>
      This has not been a problem with thicker, more viscous toothpaste.
      <br/>
      This problem varies from toothpaste to toothpaste.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Neither of these previously mentioned inventions have a means to control the flow of paste from returning to the tube or oozing out of the dispenser.</p>
    <p num="11">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,577,537 (1996) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,216 (1997) to Wells both show an apparatus for adapting toothpaste dispensers for use by physically challenged individuals.
      <br/>
      They show dispenser holders, adaptive handles, and toothbrush guides.
      <br/>
      Several objects of these devices is to provide a system for the physically challenged individuals to independently dispense toothpaste from a pump-style toothpaste dispenser, to provide a holder base that rests on a flat horizontal surface and holds the dispenser perpendicular to the flat surface, and to provide toothbrush guides to hold the brush in proper position to receive toothpaste as it is dispensed from the dispenser.
      <br/>
      It can be provided with support arms and an extension handle that when depressed also depresses the pump actuator of pump style toothpaste dispensers.
      <br/>
      It comprises a nozzle closing plate that seals the dispenser when not in use.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Both dispense out of one nozzle.
      <br/>
      Neither provide a hygienic environment to dispense the toothpaste.
      <br/>
      Multiple users use the same toothbrush guides while receiving toothpaste, exposing the guides and the toothbrush to contaminates.
      <br/>
      Neither are expandable in any fashion.
      <br/>
      Both must sit on a flat surface.
      <br/>
      Both appear to be too big to be stored away in the medicine cabinet.
      <br/>
      Both are pump-style toothpaste dispensers/containers.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      All of the above dispensers attach to toothpaste containers.
      <br/>
      Only Wells shows a dispenser that attaches and has a closing valve.
      <br/>
      This dispenser holds the container perpendicular to the surface and it appears the purpose of the closing valve is to prevent gravity from causing the paste to flow out of the container and not to prevent the paste from returning to the container.
      <br/>
      It lacks hygienic features because it dispenses through one common discharge outlet.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,577,640 to Albini (1996) shows a creamy substance dispenser that includes a main body defining a metering chamber communicating with a creamy substance container.
      <br/>
      A metering device is a sealedly slidable piston with a hollow stem and biased by a spring.
      <br/>
      This metering device perfectly seals the discharge hole to isolate the creamy substance present in the dispenser from the air.
      <br/>
      Also, this metering device is a one-way valve preventing the paste from returning to the container and contaminating the contents .
      <br/>
      This device is designed as a dispenser/container with the elements of a piston and a spring acting to seal the discharge hole from the air.
      <br/>
      It dispenses through one common discharge hole.
      <br/>
      It is not expandable.
      <br/>
      It is discarded when the contents are empty and thus is not reusable or removable.
      <br/>
      The dispenser/container is manufactured with the metering device or one-way valve installed.
      <br/>
      The user can not remove or install the one-way valve.

    <p num="15">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,651,904 to Schuckmann in (1987) shows a dispenser for pasty compositions, particularly a toothpaste dispenser, with a pump-like actuation for the portioned delivery of the contents from a nozzle outlet channel.
      <br/>
      It has a pump chamber the volume of which is decreasable against spring action by displacement of the actuator.
      <br/>
      The pump chamber is located between two valves with respect to a direction of flow of the contents.
      <br/>
      One of the valves communicates with the storage space and the other valve communicates with the nozzle outlet channel.
      <br/>
      It uses a coil spring and valve flaps in the actuation of the valves.
      <br/>
      This patent shows two valves that lie in a straight line with the one nozzle outlet channel.
      <br/>
      This dispenser does not discharge through multiple discharge outlet channels.

    <p num="20">
      In accordance with the present invention, an expandable hygienic toothpaste dispenser dispenses toothpaste through multiple personalized tubular spouts.
      <br/>
      A check-valve can be installed in the dispenser to prevent the toothpaste from returning and contaminating the contents of the toothpaste container.
      <br/>
      Notches and grooves are provided on the tubular spouts formed at an angle to the main body to hang the dispenser and toothpaste tube.

      FIG. 1A shows a container of toothpaste 20 has an opening 21 of male threaded tubular spout 22 which mates with a base end 23 of my hygienic dispenser.
      <br/>
      Female threads 24 of the bottom or base arm of my dispenser mate with male threaded tubular spout 22.
      <br/>
      Dispenser 25 can be made of any suitable material, such as plastic.
      <br/>
      A hollow passageway 26 connects to a plurality of tubular spouts 27, 28, and 29 that have exterior male threads.
      <br/>
      These male threads can be the same size as the male threads of the toothpaste container that fits the base of the dispenser or they can be of a different size.
      <br/>
      Base end 23 with its internal female threads 24 will not only accept tubular spout 22 of a toothpaste container, but can accept male threaded tubular spout 27, 28, or 29 of another similar dispenser, as shown in FIG. 4 and/or an adapter as shown in FIG. 10. Each tubular spout is permanently marked with indicia 30, such as a letter, color coding, or both.
      <br/>
      A cap 31 mates with any of tubular spouts 27, 28, or 29.
      <br/>
      An indicium 32 on cap 31 is similar to indicium 30 on tubular spout 28 and so on.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      A coil spring 33 and a ball 34 are installable by the user into a chamber area 35 adjacent to female threads 24 in base end 23 of the dispenser.
      <br/>
      The dispenser is then threaded onto the tip of the toothpaste container.
      <br/>
      The coil spring applies pressure to the ball and pushes it against opening 21 of the container, closing the flow and preventing the return flow of toothpaste back into the container.
      <br/>
      Internal splined support ridges and grooves 36 are located at the exit end of chamber 35.
      <br/>
      When the paste is pushed against the ball, the ball pushes against the spring, compressing it.
      <br/>
      The spring is supported and retained by the end of ridges.
      <br/>
      The paste then flows around the ball into the spring and through the grooves between the ridges and out the tubular spout.
      <br/>
      If the ball completely compresses the spring the paste will still pass through the grooves because the ball doesn't seal off against the uneven end of the ridged and the grooved passageway.
      <br/>
      The user is required to exert a little more pressure to compress the spring to allow the paste to flow out of the tube.
      <br/>
      This additional pressure compared with squeezing just a tube of toothpaste by itself without a hygienic dispenser is minimal.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      A push rod 37 or any other similar device is used to remove the ball and spring from the dispenser.
      <br/>
      External grooves 38 on tubular spouts formed at an angle with the main body of the dispenser are provided for hanging the dispenser.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Operation--FIGS. 1, 2</p>
    <p num="27">
      The way in which the hygienic dispenser is used starts with an examination of the components.
      <br/>
      First if the dispenser has the spring and ball installed then the user removes the cap from the toothpaste tube and screws the dispenser onto the tip of the toothpaste tube.
      <br/>
      If the spring and ball are not installed, then the user turns the dispenser so that the base faces up and inserts the spring and then the ball into the base of the dispenser.
      <br/>
      Then the user removes the cap from the toothpaste tube, turns the tube so that the tip is facing down, and screws the tip of the tube into the base of the dispenser.
      <br/>
      Inverting the dispenser with the base up helps to hold the spring and ball in place while one is connecting the dispenser and tube together.
      <br/>
      The caps are then removed from the dispenser and toothpaste is pushed from the container through the dispenser.
      <br/>
      When toothpaste fills the passageways in the tubular spouts, the caps are then placed on their matching spouts.
      <br/>
      Users are assigned to the individual tubular spouts and matching cap.
      <br/>
      The dispenser is now ready to use.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      A user then removes his or her assigned cap from the matching tubular spout and pushes toothpaste out of his or her personal spout as if the user was dispensing toothpaste from just the toothpaste container itself.
      <br/>
      However now the paste is being delivered in a hygienic manner.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      When the user has finished dispensing paste, he or she returns the matching cap to the matching tubular spout to prevent the paste at the end of the opening from being exposed to the air and contaminants.
      <br/>
      If the user failed to do this, the following user would notice the cap was missing and would replace it on the matching spout before he or she used the dispenser.
      <br/>
      The cap would need to be returned to its matching spout by the primary user or the secondary user because when a secondary user tried to use his or her assigned spout paste would try to flow from both spouts at the same time.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Occasionally the user might want to clean the dispenser and caps.
      <br/>
      The ball and spring can be removed so that the dispenser and parts can be washed inside and out.
      <br/>
      If the user purchased a viscous brand of toothpaste and determined the viscosity was such that the paste did not pull back into the container then he or she could remove the check-valve altogether.
      <br/>
      The user can choose to eliminate the function of the check-valve by removing the ball and spring from the dispenser and the dispenser will retain its other functions.
      <br/>
      The user could choose to operate the check-valve by the use of the ball alone without the urging of the spring.
      <br/>
      The viscosity of the paste as it tried to return to the container would pull the ball against the opening in the toothpaste container closing the return flow of the paste to the container.
      <br/>
      Likewise, gravity would assist in holding the ball against the opening to the container when the dispenser is hung up.
      <br/>
      The use of the spring and ball would give a definite closure each and every time pressure on the paste is relaxed and would eliminate any uncertainty of closing by not using the ball by itself without the urging of the spring.

    <p num="72">It can be seen from the above that my dispenser has many unique characteristics and advantages.</p>
    <p num="73">It provides a dispenser with a few tubular spouts that is expandable to several tubular spouts by connecting two or more dispensers together into one unit.</p>
    <p num="74">It permits the use of one container of toothpaste when two or more dispensers are joined together in one unit and attached to a single tube.</p>
    <p num="75">It permits the user to install a ball and spring in the dispenser, creating a one-way check-valve, thus preventing the contents of the container from being contaminated.</p>
    <p num="76">It provides a dispenser with tubular spouts and caps that are permanently marked by indicia and can be color coordinated for personalized toothpaste dispensing.</p>
    <p num="77">It provides a dispenser with tubular spouts with notches and grooves that allow the user to hang the dispenser with the container of toothpaste hanging below it.</p>
    <p num="78">It provides a dispenser with a base having a means for connection to the tip of a toothpaste container or to an adapter that connects to a toothpaste container or to a tubular spout of another dispenser.</p>
    <p num="79">
      It should be understood by those skilled in the art that numerous modifications, substitutions, or variations of this dispenser are possible in light of the above teachings.
      <br/>
      For example, a flange or an other mechanism can be used instead of threads for connecting several dispensers together or for connecting a dispenser to a toothpaste container or an adapter.
      <br/>
      The dispenser and adapter could have both an internal and an external means of connection at the same time.
      <br/>
      There are certain obvious limitations to the overall size of a combined unit when combining many dispensers together.
      <br/>
      Likewise additional pressure is required to push the paste a farther distance.
      <br/>
      Also the dispenser could be in the form of a cylinder or other geometric shape.
      <br/>
      The dispenser can be manufactured in the shape of a cross, a "Y", a "T", etc.
      <br/>
      The dispenser and toothpaste container can even be manufactured as one unit and the use of the check-valve is optional.
      <br/>
      In lieu of the use for toothpaste, the dispenser can be used to dispense food pastes, glues, silicones, caulks, salves, etc.
