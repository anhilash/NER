      The present invention relates to a process for preparing fluorine-containing compounds by reacting a compound which contains fluorine-exchangeable halogen with a fluoride or a mixture of fluorides with the formula Iin which Me is an alkaline earth metal ion, NH4+-ion or alkali metal ion, in the presence of a compound or a mixture of compounds of the formula (II)in which A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 independently of one another are identical or different and are a straight-chain or branched alkyl or alkenyl having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl having 4 to 8 carbon atoms, an aryl having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, or an aralkyl having 7 to 12 carbon atoms, or A1 A2, A3A4, A5A6, and A7A8 independently of one another are identical or different and are connected to one another directly or by way of O or N-A9 to form a ring having 3 to 7 ring members, A9 is an alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and B- is a monovalent acid radical or the equivalent of a polyvalent acid radical, in the presence or absence of a solvent at a temperature from 40 to 260° C.

  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">This application is a 371 of PCT/EP97/04248 filed on Feb. 6, 1997.</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a process which is an improvement over the prior art for preparing fluorine-containing compounds by means of a halogen-fluorine exchange reaction.</p>
    <p num="3">Fluorine-containing compounds are employed, inter alia, in liquid-crystalline mixtures (EP 0 602 596).</p>
    <p num="4">
      The halogen-fluorine exchange reaction is also known by the name halex reaction.
      <br/>
      It is an extensively employed method of introducing fluorine substituents into a compound containing fluorine-exchangeable halogen.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the case of aromatic compounds, especially activated aromatic compounds, the halogen-fluorine exchange proceeds in the manner of a nucleophilic substitution.
      <br/>
      The implementation of this reaction requires relatively high reaction temperatures, which are often between 200 and 300 (degree)  C., leading to the formation of in some cases considerable amounts of decomposition products.
      <br/>
      In general it is impossible to operate without a solvent, so that the space-time yields are much lower than those of solvent-free processes.
      <br/>
      As an alternative to this it is possible to use conventional phase transfer catalysts, by means of which some of the abovementioned disadvantages can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Other problems, such as poor stirrability of the reaction suspension in the case of solvent-free processes, continue to exist.
      <br/>
      Phase transfer catalysts used to date have been quaternary alkylammonium or alkylphosphonium salts (U.S. Pat. No. 4,287,374), pyridinium salts (WO 87/04194), crown ethers or tetraphenylphosphonium salts (J. H. Clark et al., Tetrahedron Letters 28 �1987�, pages 111 to 114).
      <br/>
      Some of these phase transfer catalysts have comparatively low levels of activity and are only moderately stable at the temperatures required for the implementation of the reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In view of these restrictions and disadvantages there is a great need for a process which avoids the disadvantages inherent in the known processes, especially high reaction temperatures and long reaction times, and which, moreover, provides the desired fluorine-containing compounds in yields ranging from good to very good at lower reaction temperatures and in shorter reaction times.</p>
    <p num="8">
      This object is achieved by a process for preparing fluorine-containing compounds by reacting a compound which contains fluorine-exchangeable halogen with a fluoride or a mixture of fluorides with the formula I
      <br/>
      MeF  (I),
    </p>
    <p num="9">in which Me is an alkaline earth metal ion, NH4+ -ion or alkali metal ion, in the presence or absence of a solvent at a temperature from 40 to 260 (degree)  C., which comprises carrying out the reaction in the presence of a compound or a mixture of compounds of the formula (II)  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="10">in which A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 independently of one another are identical or different and are a straight-chain or branched alkyl or alkenyl having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl having 4 to 8 carbon atoms, an aryl having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, or an aralkyl having 7 to 12 carbon atoms, or A1 A2, A3 A4, A5 A6, and A7 A8 independently of one another are identical or different and are connected to one another directly or by way of O or N--A9 to form a ring having 3 to 7 ring members, A9 is an alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and B- is a monovalent acid radical or the equivalent of a polyvalent acid radical.</p>
    <p num="11">
      It should be regarded as surprising that the use of the compounds of the formula (II) as catalyst leads to a strong acceleration of the reaction, thereby making it possible to implement the halogen-fluorine exchange reaction (halex reaction) under considerably milder conditions, in particular at lower temperatures and/or with shorter reaction times.
      <br/>
      At the same time it is also possible by this means to suppress or substantially avoid the formation of unwanted byproducts.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The novel process has other advantages as well.
      <br/>
      For instance, the compounds of the formula (II) are not toxic, or at most only slightly toxic, and in addition possess a resistance to thermal stress which is superior to that of the prior art catalysts that are frequently employed.
      <br/>
      If a compound of the formula (II) in which the radicals A1 to A8 are each a methyl group is used and is subjected over 10 hours to a temperature of not less than 230 (degree)  C., then only 0.2% of carbonaceous decomposition products are subsequently found.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The term fluorine-exchangeable halogen refers to chlorine, bromine or iodine, especially chlorine or bromine, preferably chlorine, which can be exchanged for fluoride in the context of a nucleophilic substitution.</p>
    <p num="14">A further advantage of the novel process is that a large number of compounds can be employed as starting material.</p>
    <p num="15">Thus it is possible to employ, as the compound containing fluorine-exchangeable halogen, an aromatic compound whose ring system has from 0 to 3 nitrogen atoms and carries a chlorine or bromine substituent, in particular a chlorine substituent, which can be exchanged for fluorine which compound may have at least one further substituent which promotes nucleophilic substitution of the aromatic compound.</p>
    <p num="16">
      With no claim to completeness, suitable starting compounds for the novel process are aromatic compounds of the benzene, naphthalene, pyridine, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrimidine and pyrazine type and of the type of benzofused ring systems of pyridine (quinoline, isoquinoline, acridine or acridone type), of pyrimidine, pyrazine and piperazine (benzodiazines of the cinnoline, phthalazine, quinazoline, quinazoline, phenazine or phenoxazine type) and derivatives thereof which may have at least one further substituent which promotes the nucleophilic substitution of the aromatic compound.
      <br/>
      This further substituent which promotes the nucleophilic substitution of the aromatic compound usually leads to an activation of the aromatic compound, which is thereby more readily amenable to a halogen-fluorine exchange reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The further substituent which promotes the nucleophilic substitution of the aromatic compound comprises I and M substituents, which reduce the electron density or, respectively, the nucleophilicity of the aromatic compound and thereby make electrophilic substitution more difficult.
      <br/>
      However, the aromatic compound is thereby activated with respect to a nucleophilic substitution.
      <br/>
      The activating effect of these substituents is particularly great when they stand ortho or para to the halogen that is to be exchanged for fluorine, this halogen being, in particular, chlorine or bromine, preferably chlorine.
    </p>
    <p num="18">With no claim to completeness mention may be made, as further substituents which promote the nucleophilic substitution and thus the halogen-fluorine exchange reaction, especially the chlorine-fluorine exchange reaction, of F, Cl, Br, I, NO2, NO, CF3, CN, CHO, COF, COCl, SO2 F, SO2 Cl, OCF3, SCF3, SOCF3, SO2 CF3, COOR, CONRR', SO2 R, COR, OR or a radical --CO--O--CO--, --CO--NR--CO--, which links two ortho positions, especially F, Cl, NO2, CF3, CN, CHO, COCl, SO2 Cl, COOR, SO2 CF3, CONRR', SO2 R, or COR, preferably F, Cl, NO2, CF3, CN, CHO or COCl, where R and R' each independently of one another are identical or different and are H, a straight-chain or branched alkyl having 1 to 6, especially 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an aryl having 6 to 12 carbon atoms or aralkyl having 7 to 12 carbon atoms and where the alkyls and aralkyls are unsubstituted or substituted from one to three times by halogen, especially by fluorine or chlorine.</p>
    <p num="19">It is possible to employ an aromatic compound which possesses on the ring system a fluorine-exchangeable chlorine or bromine substituent, especially a chlorine substituent, and which has at least one further substituent from the series consisting of F, Cl, Br, I, NO2, CF3, CN, CHO, COF, COCl, SO2 F, SO2 Cl, OCF3, SCF3, SOCF3, SO2 CF3, COOR, CONRR', SO2 R, COR and OR or a radical --CO--O--CO--, --CO--NR--CO--, which links two ortho positions, where R and R' each independently of one another are identical or different and are H, a straight-chain or branched alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an aryl having 6 to 12 carbon atoms or aralkyl having 7 to 12 carbon atoms, and where the alkyls and aralkyls are unsubstituted or substituted from one to three times by halogen.</p>
    <p num="20">The abovementioned aromatic compounds may also contain additional substituents, examples being alkyl radicals or amino, alkylamino, hydroxyl or alkoxy groups.</p>
    <p num="21">
      It is possible to employ as starting material an aromatic compound which has on the ring system a fluorine-exchangeable chlorine or bromine substituent, especially a chlorine substituent, and which has as a further substituent at least one fluorine-exchangeable chlorine or bromine, especially chlorine, and which may have at least one further substituent from the series consisting of F, NO2, CF3, CN, CHO, COF, COCl, SO2 F, SO2 Cl, OCF3, SCF3, SO2 CF3, COOR, CONRR', SO2 R, COR, OR, --CO--O--CO-- and --CO--NR--CO--. Accordingly, these starting compounds possess at least two fluorine-exchangeable halogen substituents which independently of one another can be chlorine or bromine, especially chlorine.
      <br/>
      These compounds are usually amenable to single or double halogen-fluorine exchange without necessarily possessing a further substituent from the abovementioned series.
      <br/>
      They may, however, also possess a further substituent from the series of the abovementioned radicals which promotes the nucleophilic substitution of the aromatic compound.
      <br/>
      The presence of the substituents increases the reactivity of the aromatic compound in respect of the halogen-fluorine exchange reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="22">In the novel process it is possible with great success to employ a compound of the formula (III)  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="23">in which W is N or C--R3, X is N or C--R4, Y is N or C--R5, Z is N or C--R6 but, W, X and Y are not simultaneously N, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are identical or different and are H, F, Cl, Br, I, NO2, NO, CF3, CN, CHO, COF, COCl, SO2 F, SO2 Cl, OCF3, SCF3, SO2 CF3, COOR, CONRR', SO2 R, COR, OR, or a radical --CO--O--CO--, --CO--NR--CO-- or --CR".dbd.CR"--CR".dbd.CR"--, which links two ortho positions, R and R' are as defined above and radicals R" independently of one another are identical or different and have the same meaning as R1 to R6, and at least one of the radicals R1 to R6 is chlorine or bromine, especially chlorine.</p>
    <p num="24">A compound of the formula (III) can be employed in which R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are identical or different and in particular are H, F, Cl, Br, NO2, CF3, CN, CHO, or COCl, preferably H, F, Cl, NO2, CN or CHO.</p>

      As catalyst it is possible to use a compound of the formula (II) or a mixture of two or more compounds of the formula (II).
      <br/>
      This is particularly simple if mixtures of compounds of the formula (II) as obtained in the synthesis are used.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      As mentioned beforehand above the process can be conducted in the presence or absence of a solvent.
      <br/>
      If used, suitable solvents include not only dipolar-aprotic and aprotic but also protic solvents.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable dipolar-aprotic solvents are dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl sulfone, sulfolane (TMS), dimethylformamide (DMFA), dimethylacetamide, 1,3-dimethylimidazolin-2-one, N-methylpyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphoramide, acetonitrile and benzonitrile.
      <br/>
      These solvents can also be employed as a mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Suitable aprotic solvents without a pronounced dipolar character are aromatic hydrocarbons or chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene, ortho, meta-, para-xylene, industrial mixtures of isomeric xylenes, ethylbenzene, mesitylene, ortho-, meta-, para-chlorotoluene, chlorobenzene and ortho-, meta-, para-dichlorobenzene.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to use mixtures of these solvents.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The aprotic or dipolar-aprotic solvents can be used in any desired amounts, for example from 5 to 500% by weight, although it is preferred to use small amounts in the region of from 5 to 30% by weight, based on the compound which contains fluorine-exchangeable halogen.
      <br/>
      If protic solvents are used the amounts employed are in the region of from 0.1 to 5, preferably from 0.1 to 2% by weight, based on the compound which contains fluorine-exchangeable halogen.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The reaction temperature depends also on the nature of the compound which contains fluorine-exchangeable halogen.
      <br/>
      Thus compounds which are comparatively slow to react in general require higher reaction temperatures, while comparatively reactive starting materials can be reacted successfully even at relatively low temperatures.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The same applies to the reaction times.
      <br/>
      Starting materials which are slow to react generally require longer reaction times than more reactive starting materials.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      At this point attention should be drawn to the fact that exchange of only one halogen for fluorine is in general easier to carry out than exchange of two or more halogens for fluorine.
      <br/>
      Double or multiple halogen-fluorine exchange requires, if indeed it takes place at all, reaction conditions which are usually much more drastic (higher reaction temperatures and longer reaction times) than single halogen-fluorine exchange.
    </p>
    <p num="70">In a large number of cases it is sufficient to conduct the novel process at a temperature from 60 to 250 (degree)  C., in particular from 90 to 220 (degree)  C. and, preferably, from 120 to 200 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="71">
      The novel process can be practiced either under reduced pressure or else under atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure.
      <br/>
      This possibility is utilized, for example, by supplying small amounts of a low-boiling aprotic solvent which forms an azeotrope with water, for example benzene, xylene, mesitylene, cyclohexane or toluene, to the reaction suspension before the beginning of the reaction.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, part of the solvent is removed again from the reaction suspension together with water by applying reduced pressure.

      This procedure makes it possible to increase the reaction rate and the yield and, in addition, to minimize the formation of byproducts.
