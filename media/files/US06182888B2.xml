      The present invention is a carton having a forty-five degree off-set seal from its bottom and a blank therefor.
      <br/>
      The carton may have a square cross-section or an octagonal cross-section.
      <br/>
      The forty-five degree off-set seal allows for a stiffer package and material savings of up to seven percent over a traditional gable top carton.
      <br/>
      A method and apparatus for fabricating the forty-five degree off-set seal are also disclosed herein.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The present invention relates to cartons.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the present invention relates to gable top cartons and carton blanks therefor.
    </p>
    <p num="5">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="6">
      Gable top cartons have been known for the better part of the twentieth century.
      <br/>
      Their characteristic simplicity and resealability have helped to sustain their popularity as containers for traditional liquid food products such as milk and juice, but in recent years they have been used for products ranging from ammunition to Epsom salts.
      <br/>
      Gable top cartons typically begin as generally rectangular carton blanks made of a laminated paperboard or similar material.
      <br/>
      The carton blanks are provided with a number of creases to facilitate folding and forming the blank into a rectangular carton having the characteristic gabled top.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      When fully folded, filled, and sealed, the gable top cartons included a gabled top structure that engages four side-panels.
      <br/>
      Traditionally, each side panel is generally perpendicular to each adjacent side panel.
      <br/>
      The panels are each divided from one another by a single vertical score line extending the entire height of the side wall.
      <br/>
      These side panels form the characteristic hollow rectangular body of the container and define the volume of product that a carton may hold.
      <br/>
      In accordance with accepted design approaches, the design of a traditional gable top carton to accommodate a specified volume involves adjusting the dimensions of the four side walls defining the rectangular body that is to contain the specified volume.
      <br/>
      Very often, these product volume requirements are specified by the packager and selected from standard volumes that have been deemed accepted in the consumer market for the product (i.e., pint, quart, half gallon, gallon, half liter, liter, etc.).
      <br/>
      When this design approach is utilized, there exists a generally established relationship between the surface area of the carton blank and the carton volume.
      <br/>
      The surface area of the carton, and particularly the area of the four side walls constituting the bulk of the surface area, is thus generally fixed for a given container volume.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Additional end panel extensions and end panel shapes are often employed to assist in folding and sealing the traditional gable top cartons.
      <br/>
      These added extensions and shapes result in added carton surface area per unit volume of product.
    </p>
    <p num="9">The traditional approaches to gable top carton design have heretofore devoted little effort to optimizing the carton surface area per unit volume of product.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The present invention is a carton with a 45 degree off-set top seal.
      <br/>
      The off-set top seal allows for the stiffening of the side panels by the bottom corners, and also increases the carton's volume.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">
      A carton 20 with a forty-five degree off-set top seal is shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The carton 20 has a gable top 22 with a top fin 24 arising from a pair of top panels 28a-b.
      <br/>
      The gable top 22 crowns a plurality of side walls 25a-h that engage to form a bottom 26 with a square cross-section.
      <br/>
      The carton 20 of the present invention has its gable top 22 off-set forty-five degrees relative to the bottom 26 as compared to a typical gable top carton 20a which is shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The prior art gable top carton 20a has its top fin 24a parallel to a side wall 27a whereas in the present invention the top fin 24 is at an angle to the side walls 25a-h.
      <br/>
      The off-set top seal creates a pseudo eight sided carton 20a, generally about the middle of the side walls 25a-h.
      <br/>
      This eight-sidedness is best seen in FIG. 3 in reference to the apices 31a-d and the edges 33a-d formed by the intersection of the adjacent side walls 25a-h.
      <br/>
      For instance, side wall 25h is defined by apex 33c and edge 31c while side wall 25a is defined by apex 33c and edge 31d.
      <br/>
      Near the bottom of the carton 20, the side walls 25h and 25a are essentially one side wall, however, near the middle (the middle defined as the midpoint between the top and bottom of the carton) side walls 25h and 25a are essentially two side walls.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The rotation allows for the bottom corners 35a-d to be used to stiffen the side walls 25a-h and increase the overall volume of the carton 20.
      <br/>
      The rotation may also result in a material surface reduction of six to seven percent of the overall carton 20.
      <br/>
      This material savings may lower the cost of the carton 20 while still providing a carton 20 that is capable of containing an equal volume of product.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A possible carton blank for creating such a carton 20 is set forth in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The carton blank 100 generally has a structure of a fiberboard base with polyethylene coatings on the surfaces.
      <br/>
      Other film structures may employ the use of barrier layers, or non-scalping polymer coatings.
      <br/>
      The carton blank 100 is defined by various score lines that allow for folding of the blank 100 to create the carton 20 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      A plurality of vertical score lines 105a-h separate the side walls 25a-h from each other.
      <br/>
      A lower horizontal score line 107 separates the side walls 25a-h (which be designated side panels in the blank form) from a plurality of bottom panels 109.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      An upper horizontal score line 111 separates the side walls 25a-h from a plurality of top panels 128a-i.
      <br/>
      A fin horizontal score line 117 separates the plurality of top panels 128a-i from the plurality of fin panels 124a-i.
      <br/>
      The top panels 128d and 128e form the top panel 28b of FIG. 1 and the top panels 128a and 128b form the top panel 28a.
      <br/>
      The top fin 24 is formed by the top fin panels 124a, 124d, 124e, 124h and 124i.
      <br/>
      The top fin panels 124a, 124d, 124e, 124h and 124i all have a maximum length that is greater than that of the top fin panels 124b, 124c, 124f and 124g.
      <br/>
      The unique top fin panel arrangement allows for the forty-five degree off-set sealing of the carton 20.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      An alternative embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. 6-10. The carton 220 of FIGS. 6-9 is for an eight-sided carton as set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,871,144 to Anchor et. al., entitled Eight-Sided Gable Top Carton which is hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      The difference between that the carton of the above-noted patent to Anchor et al. and the carton 220 of FIG. 6 is the gable top 222 of the carton 220 is off-set forty-five degrees from the bottom 226.
      <br/>
      The carton of the above-noted patent to Anchor et al. has the top fin in alignment with an inverted apex on the bottom while the carton 220 has its fin 224 in alignment with a bottom corner 235a.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The side walls 225a-h are separated from each other by the four edges 231a-d and four apices 233a-d.
      <br/>
      Unlike the embodiment of FIG. 1, the carton 220 of FIG. 6 is configured to have eight sides defined from the edges and apices, which are formed from additional vertical score lines extending from the top of the carton blank to the bottom as described below in reference to FIG. 10. The carton 20 of FIG. 1 is proved with eight-sidedness due to the forty-five degree off-set seal.
      <br/>
      Each apex of the apices 233a-d extends outward from the carton 220 thereby forming the most distant line/point on each of the sides.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Not only do the apices 233a-d provide an unique shape to the carton 220, the apices 233a-d allow for a greater volume per surface area of the carton 220 as compared to a traditional flat four-sided carton.
      <br/>
      The forty-five degree off-set seal further increases the volume per surface area of the carton 220 creating a carton with an optimum volume per surface area.
      <br/>
      Thus, the carton 220 will provide the consumer with the same volume of product as a traditional carton while using much less material.
      <br/>
      The carton 220 is also more grippable than typical cartons.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      A possible carton blank for creating such a carton 220 is set forth in FIG. 10. The carton blank 300 generally has a structure of a fiberboard base with polyethylene coatings on the surfaces.
      <br/>
      Other film structures may employ the use of barrier layers, or nonscalping polymer coatings.
      <br/>
      The carton blank 300 is defined by various score lines that allow for folding of the blank 300 to create the carton 220 of FIGS. 6-9. A plurality of vertical score lines 305a-h separate the side walls 225a-h from each other.
      <br/>
      A lower horizontal score line 307 separates the side walls 225a-h (which be designated side panels in the blank form) from a plurality of bottom panels 309a-i.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      An upper horizontal score line 311 separates the side walls 225a-h from a plurality of top panels 228a-i.
      <br/>
      A fin horizontal score line 317 separates the plurality of top panels 228a-i from the plurality of fin panels 224a-i.
      <br/>
      The top fin 224 is formed by the top fin panels 324a, 324d, 324e, 324h and 324i.
      <br/>
      The top fin panels 324a, 324d, 324e, 324h and 324i all have a maximum length that is greater than that of the top fin panels 324b, 324c, 324f and 324g.
      <br/>
      The unique top fin panel arrangement allows for the forty-five degree off-set sealing of the carton 220.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      A plurality of diagonal score lines 357a-f define an integrated pour spout area of the carton 220.
      <br/>
      To access the contents of the carton 220, the integrated pour spout is readied by tearing open the carton 220 at the top panels.
      <br/>
      In opening the pour spout, the top fin 224 is split in two by the consumer.
      <br/>
      It is further contemplated that a fitment, not shown, may be attached to the carton 220 for accessing the product.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Top fin 224 defines a central plane of the carton 220 extending from the top to the bottom of the carton 220 with the top fin 224 lying on the central plane.
      <br/>
      The carton 220 has an octagonal cross-section.
      <br/>
      In such an embodiment, if apex 233a is at zero degrees, then each of the other apices and edges would have the following rotational coordinates: edge 231d, forty-five degrees; apex 233d, ninety degrees; edge 231c, one hundred thirty-five degrees; apex 233c, one hundred eighty degrees; edge 231b, two hundred twenty-five degrees; apex 233b, two hundred seventy degrees; and edge 231a, three hundred fifteen degrees.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The inverse pyramidal bottom 226 is formed from a plurality of bottom panels 309a-i.
      <br/>
      Flaps 309e, 309f, 309a, 309b are folded inward first while flaps 309c, 309d, 309g, 309h and 309i are folded on top thereof to form the inverse pyramidal bottom 226.
      <br/>
      For each bottom corner 235a-d, there is a bottom inverse apex 243a-d.
      <br/>
      As mentioned previously, the top fin 224 is in alignment with the bottom corner 235a.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      A possible method and apparatus of forming the forty-five degree off-set top seal carton 20 of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 11. The machine 400 includes a bottom forming station 500 where the bottom of the carton 20 is fabricated in a conventional manner.
      <br/>
      This usually occurs on a mandrel wheel where an erected carton blank is set upon a mandrel, pre-folded, heated, and then pressed together for sealing.
      <br/>
      One of the benefits of the present invention is that the bottom may be formed in a traditional manner.
      <br/>
      The only major adjustment to a packaging machine would be to the conveyor line 502 that must receive, hold and transport the cartons 20 at an angle, to the various stations on machine 400.
      <br/>
      One possible adjustment would be to have the carton pockets 505 on the conveyor line 502 in a diamond shape.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the cartons 20 are transported to the sterilization station 507, the filling station 509 and the top sealing station 511 at the necessary forty-five degree angle.
      <br/>
      At the top sealing station 511, the top sealing jaws will operate in a conventional manner to seal the fill carton 20 to create the desire forty-five degree off-set top seal carton 20.
