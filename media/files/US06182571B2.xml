    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to planographic printing and provides a method of preparing a planographic printing member, for example a plate, and a planographic printing member per se.
      <br/>
      The invention particularly, although not exclusively, relates to lithographic printing.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Lithographic processes involve establishing image (printing) and non-image (non-printing) areas on a substrate, substantially on a common plane.
      <br/>
      When such processes are used in printing industries, non-image areas are generally hydrophilic and image areas are generally oleophillic.
      <br/>
      Consequently, oil based inks are repelled from the non-image areas after water has been applied to the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Image and non-image areas can be created by processes which include a step of exposing a layer of image material on the surface of the substrate to radiation.
      <br/>
      The exposure to radiation creates solubility differences in the image material corresponding to image and non-image areas.
      <br/>
      During development, the more soluble areas are removed, leaving a pattern on the substrate corresponding to the image.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Preparation of the substrate for receiving a layer of the image material must ensure that the image material bonds to the substrate.
      <br/>
      However, it must allow release of the soluble image material during development.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In addition, other problems need to be addressed when preparing a printing plate.
      <br/>
      For example, it is desirable for the image material to change color when it is exposed.
      <br/>
      This is generally achieved by including a pH sensitive dye in the material of the image layer, the dye often being arranged to change color by reaction with acid produced during a photochemical reaction of the light sensitive material of the image layer.
      <br/>
      However, it has been found that properties of the substrate itself can affect the ability of the dye to change color.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is desirable for the dye not to stain the substrate to any significant degree since, otherwise, on development, such staining will be visible.
      <br/>
      This would be aesthetically unacceptable and, furthermore, would be commercially unacceptable since plate processing personnel would be unable to determine whether a plate had been fully developed.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      It is also desirable for it to be possible to remove unwanted image areas from a printing plate after exposure, for example to correct an error, in order to prevent such areas inking in and, therefore, being printed.
      <br/>
      The ability to remove selected areas will depend, to some extent, on the adhesive force between the substrate and the material of the image layer.
    </p>
    <p num="8">It is an object of the present invention to address the above-described problems.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of preparing a planographic printing member comprising:</p>
    <p num="10">
      a) forming a hydrophilic layer on a support by contacting the support with a fluid containing a particulate material;
      <br/>
      b) applying a modifying means over said hydrophilic layer for modifying interaction between said hydrophilic layer and a material subsequently applied; and
      <br/>
      c) providing an image layer over said hydrophilic layer, wherein an indicator means is associated with said image layer for indicating whether said image layer is in a first or a second state.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Preferably, said planographic printing member is a printing plate.</p>
    <p num="12">
      Preferably, said indicator means is adapted for visually indicating whether said image layer is in a first or second state.
      <br/>
      Preferably, said indicator means is arranged to undergo a chemical reaction, for example an acid-base or oxidation/reduction reaction, when said image layer changes from said first state to said second state.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Preferably, said indicator means is adapted to indicate whether the image layer has been exposed.
      <br/>
      Preferably, said indicator means causes the printing member to display a different color after exposure compared to the color displayed before exposure.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Said indicator means may comprise a photo-oxidative system, suitably using a free radical generator, for example triazine, arranged to oxidize an indicator material, for example a leucobase dye.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, said indicator means may comprise a photo-acid generator.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Preferably, the image layer is adapted to have a different, for example a lower, pH after exposure compared to the pH before exposure.
      <br/>
      For example, the image layer may be adapted to produce H+ (or other acidic species) upon exposure.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Said indicator means is preferably pH sensitive.
      <br/>
      Said indicator means is preferably a pH indicator.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Said indicator means is preferably incorporated in said image layer, for example by being dispersed therein.</p>
    <p num="18">
      A suitable modifying means can be selected by comparing the effect of a proposed modifying means on said indicator means when said proposed modifying means has been applied, with the effect (if any) when said proposed modifying means has not been applied.
      <br/>
      When no modifying means is applied, the indicator means may be incapable of indicating between said first and second states of said image layer.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Said modifying means is preferably applied at ambient temperature or above, more preferably in the range 20 (degree)  C. to 90 (degree)  C., especially 20 (degree)  C. to 60 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Preferably, said modifying means is arranged to lower the pH of at least the outermost surface of the hydrophilic layer, so that its pH after application of said modifying means is less than its pH before application.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the pH (before application) of the fluid used in step (a) is greater than the pH (before application) of the modifying means used in step (b).
      <br/>
      The pH of the fluid may be greater than 9.0, preferably greater than 9.5 and, more preferably, greater than 10 0 (slashed zero)  The pH of the modifying means may be less than 10.0, preferably less than 9.0, more preferably less than 8 0 (slashed zero)  Especially preferred is the case wherein the pH is about 7 or below.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiments, the pH is less than 5 0 (slashed zero)  The pH may be above 1, preferably above 2 and more preferably above 3.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Some modifying means suitable for use in said method, for example sulphuric acid, affect whether a deletion means, for example a deletion fluid, in particular a deletion gel or pen, can be used to satisfactorily remove ink receptive areas of said image layer.
      <br/>
      Preferably, said modifying means is arranged such that a selected deletion means can be used to make areas of said printing member to which it is applied less ink receptive (and preferably substantially non-ink receptive) compared to when said modifying means consists essentially of 0.1M sulphuric acid.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Said deletion means preferably includes a solvent, suitably an organic solvent, with N-methylpyrolidone and cyclohexanone being especially preferred; an etchant material which may be acidic or alkaline but is preferably acidic, and is suitably selected from phosphoric acid, hydrogen fluoride and ammonium bifluoride; and other minor components, for example surface active agents, thickeners and the like.</p>
    <p num="23">
      Preferably, said modifying means includes water as a solvent.
      <br/>
      Preferably, said modifying means comprises an aqueous solution or dispersion.
      <br/>
      Preferably, said modifying means includes one or more components selected from acids, buffer formulations, colloidal suspensions and salts.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Preferred acids are protic acids and include phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, sodium hydrogen carbonate and boric acid, with boric acid being especially preferred.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Preferred buffer formulations include formulations including citric acid and/or a monohydrogen phosphate and/or a dihydrogen phosphate and/or boric acid in combination with, for example a strong acid and/or an alkali.
      <br/>
      Especially preferred buffer formulations include a phosphate.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Preferred colloidal suspensions include insoluble oxides and/or hydroxides, preferably of Group III or IV elements, with silica and aluminum hydroxide being especially preferred.</p>
    <p num="27">
      Cations of salts may be selected from group I, II and III, metals and transition metals, especially, first row transition metals.
      <br/>
      Preferred salts have cations selected from sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, aluminum, titanium, manganese, iron, copper and zinc.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Anions of salts may be selected from sulphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogen phosphate, orthophosphate, polyvinylphosphonate, acetate, citrate, aluminate, chloride, propionate and nitrate.</p>
    <p num="29">Preferred salts include aluminum sulphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium sulphate, sodium citrate, calcium monohydrogenphosphate, aluminum nitrate, aluminum chloride, titanium III sulphate, iron III nitrate, iron III sulphate, iron II sulphate, iron III phosphate, copper II sulphate, copper nitrate, zinc II sulphate, zinc phosphate and manganese phosphate.</p>
    <p num="30">Especially preferred salts include aluminum sulphate, aluminum nitrate, iron III nitrate, iron III sulphate, iron II sulphate, copper II sulphate, copper nitrate and zinc II sulphate.</p>
    <p num="31">The most preferred salt is aluminum sulphate.</p>
    <p num="32">Where said modifying means comprises a solution or dispersion, the concentration of the solute or dispersant may be at least 2 wt %, suitably at least 3 wt %, preferably at least 4 wt % and more preferably, at least 5 wt %. The concentration of the solute or dispersant may be less than 50 wt %, preferably less than 40 wt % and, more preferably, less than 30 wt %.</p>
    <p num="33">Preferred modifying means are those which both modify interaction between said hydrophilic layer and an image layer and which are arranged such that a selected deletion means can be used to make areas of said printing member to which it is applied less ink receptive compared to when said restrictor means consists essentially of 0.1M sulphuric acid.</p>
    <p num="34">
      Preferred modifying means are believed to form a deposit or precipitate over said hydrophilic layer which may act as a barrier to the passage of alkaline material from the hydrophilic layer to the image layer.
      <br/>
      Such a precipitate is preferably essentially insoluble in water.
      <br/>
      In some cases, the modifying means applied may be capable of chemically reacting with said hydrophilic layer to produce an insoluble precipitate.
      <br/>
      For example, when aluminum sulphate is used as said restriction means, insoluble aluminum hydroxide may be formed.
      <br/>
      In other cases, however, the modifying means may act by washing off material from the hydrophilic layer.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Said restrictor means may be applied by any suitable means, for example by dipping, spraying or roller coating.</p>
    <p num="36">
      Preferably, in the method, the first fluid to be contacted with said hydrophilic layer formed in step (a) has a pH which is less than the pH (before application) of the fluid used to form the hydrophilic layer.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the first fluid contacted with said hydrophilic layer is said modifying means.
      <br/>
      Said modifying means may be applied either before, or more preferably after, the hydrophilic layer is touch dry.
      <br/>
      Thus, preferably, there is no intermediate chemical treatment step between steps (a) and (b) described above.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Preferably, said modifying means is applied in a single step.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The surface to which said image layer is applied may have a pH of less than 8, preferably less than 7.
      <br/>
      The pH of said surface may be at least 2, preferably at least 3.
      <br/>
      The pH of said surface may suitably be measured using an aqueous indicator dye.

      The method preferably includes the steps of providing suitable conditions for the removal of water from the fluid after it has been applied to the support in step (a).
      <br/>
      Suitable conditions -may involve passive or active removal of water and may comprise causing an air flow over the support and/or adjusting the humidity of air surrounding the support.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the method includes the step of arranging the support in a heated environment.
      <br/>
      The support may be placed in an environment so that its temperature does not exceed 230 (degree)  C., preferably does not exceed 200 (degree)  C. and, more preferably, does not exceed 175 (degree)  C. Especially preferred is the case wherein the support temperature does not exceed 150 (degree)  C.

    <p num="76">The support may be arranged in the heated environment for less than 180 seconds, preferably less than 120 seconds and, more preferably, less than 100 seconds.</p>
    <p num="77">
      The support may comprise aluminum or an alloy.
      <br/>
      In this event, it is found to be advantageous to arrange the support in an environment wherein the temperature is less than 230 (degree)  C. as described above since, at this temperature, annealing of the support is not significant and, therefore, the tensile strength of the support is maintained at an acceptable level.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the tensile strength of the aluminum, suitably measured using a Hounsfield tensile testing machine, may be at least 100 MPa, preferably at least 110 MPa and, more preferably, at least 120 MPa.
      <br/>
      Especially preferred is the case wherein the tensile strength is at least 140 MPa.

    <p num="78">
      The fluid described above may also be advantageously applied to a plastic support, for example a polyester, in order to provide a hydrophilic layer thereon, in view of the fact that the fluid needs only to be cured at a relatively low temperature for a short time.
      <br/>
      As will be appreciated, curing at a relatively high temperature for long periods might otherwise detrimentally affect the properties of the plastics material.
    </p>
    <p num="79">The removal of water from the fluid applied to the support is believed to cause the silicate to polymerize and bind the inorganic particulate material in position.</p>
    <p num="80">
      Thus, it should be appreciated that one advantage of the method of the present invention may be that a relatively wide range of support materials may be used.
      <br/>
      For example, where the support material is aluminum or an alloy, a relatively low grade metal could be used compared to the grade of metal usually used for lithographic plates.
      <br/>
      Additionally and/or alternatively, a metal which is more resistant to, for example developer chemicals, could be used.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the method may be used to apply a hydrophilic layer to other types of support materials, for example other metals, foil coated paper and plastics.

    <p num="81">
      A support material may be pretreated prior to the application of said hydrophilic layer.

      It will be appreciated that the areas should not accept ink.
      <br/>
      iii) Dyestain
    </p>
    <p num="152">After deletion as described in Example 31, the plates were assessed visually to determine whether any of the Victoria blue dye included in the light sensitive coating had stained the plate in areas where the coating had been removed.</p>
    <p num="153">Results</p>
    <p num="154">Each of the plates prepared as described in Examples 2 to 25 was found to give a color change upon exposure (when assessed as described in Example 33(i)); to give image deletion on application of a deletion gel (when assessed as described in Example 33(ii)); and had low/negligible dyestain (when assessed as described in Example 33(iii)).</p>
    <p num="155">From the plates prepared in Example 26, it was observed that as the weight of the coating formulations is increased the temperature of the aluminum sulphate dip and/or residence time of plates in the dipping tank needs to be increased to obtain a satisfactory color change as described in Example 34(i).</p>
