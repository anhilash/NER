      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The present invention relates to the field of data storage systems such as disk drives.
      <br/>
      The invention particularly relates to a slider design for use in an optical or magneto-optical read-write head for high density recording and reading of information onto and from a storage medium.
    </p>
    <p num="6">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="7">
      Data storage systems such as those used with computer systems, typically store data magnetically or magneto-optically onto a storage medium.
      <br/>
      The data stored on the medium, whether magnetic or optical, is contained in spiral or concentric tracks.
      <br/>
      An optical data storage system described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,799,210 to Wilson, includes a laser diode assembly mounted on a fixed platform, and an optical head mounted on a movable stage.
      <br/>
      The laser beam is coupled to the movable head through a flexible optical fiber.
      <br/>
      Japanese patent application No. 59-117,180 describes another optical system mounted on the top or upper side of a slider.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Efforts to reduce the size and weight of optical heads are represented by optical integrated circuits or thin film structures. U.S. Pat. No. 4,911,512 to Yamamoto et al. describes a far-field type optical transducer, and a semi-conductor laser secured on a submount of silicon.
      <br/>
      A thin film silicon dioxide, SiO2, waveguide element and a glass waveguide layer are also fixed on the submount.
      <br/>
      A collimator lens, a beam splitter, and a focusing grating are formed on the glass waveguide layer.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Another attempt to achieve compactness and weight reduction of a magneto-optical head is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,199,090 to Bell.
      <br/>
      The Bell patent describes a magneto-optic head fabricated on a glass slider and flown adjacent a magneto-optical disk.
      <br/>
      A transducer is fabricated on an end of the glass slider.
      <br/>
      A planar or channel waveguide structure, fabricated by ion exchange in the end face of the glass slider, couples light from a light source, such as a laser diode, to the disk for reading or writing.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Conventional magnetic read-write heads commonly utilize sliders as carriers for the magnetic assembly.
      <br/>
      These sliders are typically designed in compliance with the International Disk Drive Equipment and Material Association (IDEA) specifications.
      <br/>
      The following Table I illustrates conventional slider design characteristics that are not applicable yet to optical or magneto-optical sliders.

    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Optical heads present several slider design concerns.
      <br/>
      A first concern relates to the optical path of the optical assembly mounted on the slider.
      <br/>
      The optical path limits the ability to reduce the slider height, particularly if such a height forms part of the optical path.
      <br/>
      Another concern relates to the footprint (i.e., the projected surface area) of the slider, which should be sufficiently large to carry the optical assembly and the fibers mounted onto the slider, without affecting the aerodynamic flying performance of the optical head.
      <br/>
      Yet another consideration is the weight of the slider in light of the additional weight of the optical assembly and fibers.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Another design concern is the overall weight of the optical head.
      <br/>
      It is a desirable objective to reduce the slider weight in order to improve the data access time.
      <br/>
      However, the slider design in an optical or magneto-optical read-write head is more involved than the slider design of a magnetic head, since additional features are needed to accommodate the slider optical components such as a lens, a mirror, optical fibers, and a field generating magnetic coil in the case to a magneto-optical recording head.
      <br/>
      These additional components augment the fabrication complexity of the slider design, and further increase the access time.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      For example, the pico slider might not be an effective aerodynamic platform because it is too small and light, causing the optical fiber stiffness to dominate the slider air bearing stiffness.
      <br/>
      The pico, nano and micro sliders might not be effective optical platforms because they are too thin, and probably would not meet the optical requirements of the head.
      <br/>
      The mini slider would satisfy the optical requirements of the head; however, the mini slider is too bulky and heavy, particularly with the added mass of the optical assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="15">The continuing trend toward miniaturization of data storage systems is faced with the foregoing and other concerns, and cannot be accomplished by an arbitrary reduction in size and weight of the sliders.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      According to the present invention, improvement is achieved in compactness and weight reduction of the slider design.
      <br/>
      The slider allows optical drives to achieve access time comparable to that of a magnetic head disk drive.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the slider enables a more reliable head to disk interface system with an optical or magneto-optical plastic disk, and effects a lower gram load on the load beam and the slider.
      <br/>
      The slider of the present invention is reliable, and is compliant with the uneven topography of a rotating disk.
      <br/>
      The new slider design allows a relatively tight disk to disk spacing because of its z- height.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The foregoing and other features of the present invention are realized by a new slider that directs a read-write laser beam onto and from a data storage disk.
      <br/>
      An optical assembly is mounted on the slider body, and includes an optical fiber, a mirror, a quarter wavelength plate, and a lens.
      <br/>
      The optical fiber guides the laser beam along an optical path defined by the optical assembly and the slider body.
      <br/>
      The laser beam emanating from the optical fiber impinges upon the mirror and is reflected thereby onto and through the quarter wavelength plate.
      <br/>
      The laser beam continues its travel along the optical path through the lens and a magnetic coil assembly onto the disk.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The slider body is dimensioned to accommodate the physical size and weight of the optical assembly, as well as the working distance between a lens and the disk, along the optical path.
      <br/>
      The slider body is dimensioned to accommodate the dimensional constraints of the optical assembly.
      <br/>
      The slider has the approximate height of a mini slider, i.e., approximately 889  MU m, and the planar footprint area corresponding to that of a nano slider, i.e., a length of approximately 2032  MU m and a width of approximately 1600  MU m. Several channels are formed in the slider to define an unobstructed optical path.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="21">
      FIGS. 1 through 5 illustrate a slider 10 and an optical assembly 12 for use in an optical or magneto-optical head according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      With further reference to FIG. 4, and as it will be explained later in greater detail, the optical assembly 12 is mounted in part within the slider 10, for directing a read-write laser beam (or light beam) 14 onto and from a data storage medium, such as an optical or a magneto-optical disk 15.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      According to one embodiment of the present invention, the optical assembly 12 includes a linearly polarized diode laser source (not shown) operating in a visible or near ultraviolet frequency region and emitting an optical power sufficient for reading and writing data onto and from the disk 15.
      <br/>
      The laser diode source may be a RF (radio frequency) modulated laser source.
      <br/>
      In an exemplary embodiment the linearly polarized laser source is selected to operate within a range of 635-685 nm; however, a laser source of other frequencies can alternatively be used.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The optical assembly 12 includes an optical fiber 16, a mirror 20, a quarter wavelength plate 22, and a lens 24.
      <br/>
      The optical fiber 16 guides the laser beam 14 along an optical path defined by the optical assembly 12.
      <br/>
      While only one optical fiber 16 is shown for the purpose of illustration, it should be clear that additional optical fibers or other light conveying means can alternatively be employed.
      <br/>
      The laser beam 14 emanating from the optical fiber 16 impinges upon the mirror 20 and is reflected thereby onto and through the quarter wavelength plate 22.
      <br/>
      The laser beam 14 continues its travel along the optical path through the lens 24 and a magnetic coil assembly 26 onto the disk 15.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      During the data writing phase, the laser beam 14 is routed by the optical assembly 12 to a magneto-optical recording layer 29 of the disk 15.
      <br/>
      The laser beam 14 lowers the coercivity of the magneto-optical layer 29 by heating a target spot 31 to a critical temperature, for example the Curie point of the magneto-optical layer 29.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the optical intensity of the laser beam 14 is held constant, while a time varying vertical bias magnetic field generated by a magnetic coil assembly 26 is used to define a pattern of "up" or "down" magnetic domains perpendicular to the disk 15.
      <br/>
      This technique is known as magnetic field modulation (MFM).
      <br/>
      As the selected spot 31 cools at the surface layer, information embodied in the laser beam 14 is encoded on the disk 15.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      During the data readout phase, the laser beam 14 (at a lower intensity compared to the laser beam used in the data writing phase) is routed by the optical assembly 12 to the disk 14.
      <br/>
      At any given spot of interest, i.e., 31, upon reflection of the laser beam 14 from the magneto-optical layer 29, the Kerr effect causes the reflected laser beam 14 to have a rotated polarization of either clockwise or counter clockwise sense that depends on the magnetic domain polarity at the spot 31.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the present embodiment, the optical path of the laser beam 14 is bi-directional.
      <br/>
      The reflected laser beam 14 is received through the optical assembly 14 and propagates along the optical fiber 16 to exit at one of its ends for subsequent conversion to an electrical signal.
      <br/>
      Additional operational details of the optical assembly 12 can found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,903,525, which is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The slider 10 includes a body 11 which is dimensioned to accommodate the physical size and weight of the optical assembly 12, as well as the working distances along the optical path, between a forward end 33 of the optical fiber 16, the mirror 20, the lens 24 and the magneto-optical layer 29 of the disk 15.
      <br/>
      The dimensions of the slider 14 do not strictly comply to industry standards (refer to Table I above).
      <br/>
      Rather, the slider 10 is dimensioned to accommodate the dimensional constraints of the optical assembly 12.
      <br/>
      In general, the height of the slider body 11 ranges, for example between approximately 876  MU m and approximately 902  MU m, and the slider body planar footprint ranges, for example between approximately 1975  MU m * 1552  MU m, and approximately 2089  MU m * 1645  MU m. In a preferred embodiment, the slider 10 has a height H (FIG. 4) about that of a mini slider, i.e., approximately 889  MU m, and the planar footprint area corresponding to that of a nano slider, i.e., a length L of approximately 2032  MU m and a width W of approximately 1600  MU m (FIG. 2).
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      With further reference to FIG. 2, the optical fiber 16 is secured to the slider 10 along a fiber channel (also referred to as the first channel) 40 formed on or within the upper surface (i.e., top) of the slider 10, and extends along substantially the entire length of the slider 10.The channel 40 is sufficiently wide to receive the optical fiber 16.
      <br/>
      The width w1 of the first channel 40 ranges, for example between approximately 114  MU m and approximately 140  MU m. In a preferred embodiment the width w1 is approximately 127  MU m. The optical fiber 16 is placed within the channel 40, in a recessed position, and the channel 40 is filled with an ultraviolet curing epoxy or similar adhesive material to secure the optical fiber 16 to the slider 10.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The channel 40 terminates at its forwardmost end 42 in an opening 43A (FIG. 1) which is relatively larger in size than the width w1 of the fiber channel 40.
      <br/>
      Although, in a preferred embodiment the fiber channel 40 is located in proximity to a longitudinal side 43 of the slider 10, a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the fiber channel 40 can be located at other positions on the slider 10, for example, between the longitudinal side and a central axis or, alternatively, along the central axis itself.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      A transverse channel 44 (also referred to as adhesive stop channel) extends at an angle relative to the fiber channel 40.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the transverse channel 44 is substantially perpendicular to the fiber channel 40, across substantially the entire width of the slider 10.
      <br/>
      The fiber channel 40 crosses the transverse channel 44 at an edge 41.
      <br/>
      The width w2 of the transverse channel 44 is, for example approximately 127  MU m. The transverse channel 44 acts as a stop for the adhesive material within the fiber channel 40, to prevent the adhesive material from flowing to the mirror 20 and affecting the integrity of the optical path.
      <br/>
      Thus, excess adhesive material is allowed to flow into the transverse channel 44.
      <br/>
      Although, in a preferred embodiment the transverse channel 44 is located in proximity to a trailing edge or side 51 (FIG. 1) of the slider 10, a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the transverse channel 44 may be located at other positions on the slider 10.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The forward end 33 of the optical fiber 16 projects in part within the transverse channel 44, and is raised above the bottom 45 (FIG. 4) of the transverse channel 44 to prevent excess adhesive material from flowing against, and obstructing the path of travel of the laser beam 14.
      <br/>
      The forward end 33 is directed toward the mirror 20, and is positioned at a predetermined distance therefrom.
      <br/>
      The laser beam 14 emanating from the fiber 16 traverses the forward portion 46 of the fiber channel 40 and impinges upon a target field 50 on the mirror 20, along an unobstructed path.
      <br/>
      To this end, the transverse channel 44 prevents the adhesive material from flowing into the forward portion 46 of the fiber channel 40.
      <br/>
      The forward end 33 of the optical fiber 16 is positioned at an optical path distance "a" from the target field 50 of the mirror 20.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment the distance "a" is approximately 450  MU m, though this value can vary in other embodiments.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Considering now the trailing edge 51 of the slider 10, it is formed of a flat slanted or angled surface 55 (FIG. 1) upon which the mirror 20 is mounted.
      <br/>
      The mirror 20 deflects the laser beam 14 from the optical fiber 16 toward the lens 24.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the slanted surface 55 is disposed at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, so that the light beam 14 is reflected at a right angle by the mirror 20 (FIG. 4).
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      With reference to FIGS. 1, 3 and 4, the trailing edge 51 also includes an upright or vertical channel 60 which is in optical communication with the fiber channel 40, for housing the lens 24, and for defining a portion of the optical path along which the laser beam 14 travels.
      <br/>
      The width of the vertical channel 60 ranges, for example between approximately 214  MU m and approximately 240  MU m, and is preferably approximately 227  MU m. The center line 64 of the optical path is co-aligned with the focal axis of the lens 24 (FIG. 3), and is positioned at a distance of approximately 803 microns from the longitudinal side 43 of the slider 10.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The trailing edge 51 further includes a lateral channel 70, disposed at approximately the center of the trailing edge 51 (FIG. 1) for receiving the quarter wavelength plate 22.
      <br/>
      The lateral channel 70 lies in a plane that is generally normal to the planes of the fiber channel 40 and the vertical channel 60.
      <br/>
      The lens 24 is fitted within the vertical channel 60 underneath the quarter wavelength plate 22 to achieve focus of the laser beam 14 as a focused optical spot 31.
      <br/>
      According to another embodiment, the lens 24 is fitted within the lateral channel 70 along the path of travel of the laser beam 14.
      <br/>
      The bottom of the lens 24 is slightly recessed relative to the air bearing surface 77 defined by the twin rails 80, 82 (FIG. 5) of the slider 10.
      <br/>
      A relief 83 (FIG. 5) is formed between the two rails 80, 82.
      <br/>
      The magnetic coil assembly 26 is secured to the bottom of the lens 24 (FIG. 4), and has a thickness "t1" of, for example approximately 31  MU m. After the slider 10 and the optical assembly 12 are assembled, the upper surface of the slider 10 is secured to a suspension.
      <br/>
      Two peripheral grooves 53 are formed along the two opposite sides 43 to simplify the assembly of the optical components onto the slider 10.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      With reference to FIG. 4, and according to one embodiment of the present invention, the lens 24 is a GRIN lens.
      <br/>
      The lens 24 includes at its bottom end a planar surface and at the opposite end a convex surface with a radius of curvature of approximately 190  MU m. The lens 24 has a diameter of approximately 250  MU m, and a length of approximately 329  MU m. An optical path length "b" from the target field 50 of the mirror 20 to the convex surface of the lens 24 is approximately 443  MU m. While one exemplary embodiment of the lens 24 has been described, it will be appreciated that other types and geometries of the lens 24 are possible.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The optical assembly 12 presents constraints on the slider height.
      <br/>
      For instance, the optical assembly 12 should generate a small enough spot 31 on the disk 15.
      <br/>
      If the slider height "H" is excessive, the slider center of gravity will shift upward, affecting the head stability, and reducing the access time.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In one embodiment the mirror 20 is a steerable micro-machined mirror assembly, and includes a generally 300  MU m square reflective target field 50.
      <br/>
      Fine tracking and short seeks to a series of nearby tracks may be performed by rotating the reflective target field 50 about a rotation axis so that the propagation angle of the laser beam 14 is changed before transmission to quarter wavelength plate 22.
      <br/>
      The reflective target field 50 is rotated by applying a differential voltage to a set of drive electrodes.
      <br/>
      The differential voltage on the electrodes creates an electrostatic force that rotates the reflective target field 50 about a set of axial hinges (not shown), and enables the focused optical spot 31 to be moved in the radial direction of the disk 15.
      <br/>
      Wires 50A are connected to the mirror 20 for providing dithering and other control signals.
      <br/>
      The mirror 20 may include a piezzo-electric element that enables the dithering for fine tracking of the laser beam 14.

    <p num="39">
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that positioning the optical assembly 12 at other than along the central axis of the slider 10 may affect the center of mass of the head, and thus its flying dynamics.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the point of attachment of the head to a suspension (not shown), may require adjustment to compensate for off-center changes in the center of mass of the head.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the channels 40, 44, 60, 70 are designed as V-grooves, or any other suitable channels for coupling the optical assembly 12 to the slider 10 and for aligning it relative to the suspension and the disk 15.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      With reference to FIG. 5, the rails 80, 82 define the positive pressure air bearing surface 77 of the slider 10, and do not extend along the entire length of the slider 10.
      <br/>
      This enables the slider 10 to accommodate the optical assembly 12 and the higher frequency of axial modulation around the disk 15.
      <br/>
      In an exemplary embodiment, the length "I" of each rail 80, 82, including its corresponding taper 87, 88 is, for example approximately 1,701  MU m. The length of each taper 87, 88 is, for example approximately 203  MU m. In operation, the plane of the air bearing surface 77 is for example approximately 0.4  MU m from the upper surface of the rotating disk 15.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The width of the symmetrical rails 80, 82 is preferably increased over those of conventional sliders, in order to compensate for the relatively short rail length and to provide the required air bearing surface.
      <br/>
      An exemplary width "w2" of the rails 80, 82 and that of the tapers 87, 88 is approximately 460  MU m. While the slider 10 has been described as having the footprint of a nano slider and the height of a mini slider, it should be understood that other size variations are possible provided they meet the physical and the optical path length requirements of the optical assembly 12, without compromising the aerodynamic performance of the head.
      <br/>
      For illustration purpose, each rail has its width to length ratio ranging between approximately 0.26 and approximately 0.28, with a more preferred value of approximately 0.27.
    </p>
    <p num="42">The slider 10 is a platform that acts as a carrier to mount optical components as well as writing field components onto a slider for optical recording or MO (magneto-optical) recording.</p>
    <p num="43">
      FIG. 6 illustrates the slider 10 of the present invention and a conventional slider 85 flying over the disk 15.
      <br/>
      The disk 15 can be made of plastic material and as a result, its microscopic surface is typically foil shaped and irregular.
      <br/>
      Plastic disks usually present excessive warpage compared to aluminum or glass disks, but allow servo patterns to be easily and inexpensively stamped.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      To illustrate, the plastic disk 15 shown in FIG. 6 may have an undulation period T (i.e., the distance between two successive peaks or valleys) of approximately 8,000  MU m, that is about twice the length of a conventional mini slider 85.
      <br/>
      As it can be appreciated, the conventional slider 85 does not effectively negotiate the wavy surface of the disk 15, and may lead to head crashes.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the slider 10 of the present invention has about one half the length of the mini slider 85 and can effectively "ride (small circle)  or negotiate the surface of the disk 15, thus effectively minimizing head crashes.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, the length of the slider body 11 ranges between approximately 25 percent and approximately 75 percent of the undulation period T.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The slider 10 may be obtained by slicing a wafer into a plurality of individual die, with the channels 40, 44, 60 and 70 formed in at least some of the die.
      <br/>
      The slider 10 can be made of hard material such as titanium carbide.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the slider 10 may be prefabricated or molded from calcium titanate or another suitable material, either individually, or sliced from a row bar of sliders.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the slider 10 may be formed of suitable material such as silicon, by various available techniques such as hot isostatic press process (HIP), reactive etching, ion beam etching, or other etching or machining processes.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      FIG. 7 shows a molded slider 110.
      <br/>
      By molding the slider 10 it is now possible to achieve complex geometrical slider designs in a single molding process, since the a manufacturing complexity is transferred to the reusable mold design.
      <br/>
      Another aspect of the molding process is that cavities or vias 115, 117 can be formed inside or on the surface of the slider 10, to further reduce the slider mass, for faster access time and also to reduce the electrical current requirements to drive the HGA actuator, since a lower slider mass significantly affects the polar moment of inertia of head.
      <br/>
      Moreover, for positive pressure air bearing designs such as the twin taper flat illustrated in FIG. 5, specific geometries can be achieved by the molding process.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Another advantage of forming cavities within the slider 10 is the ability to optimize the location of the slider center of gravity to account for the optical assembly 12 loaded thereon.
      <br/>
      While only two cavities 115, 117 are shown, it should be understood that additional cavities can be formed, patterned, and distributed throughout the slider volume.

      With further reference to FIGS. 4, 5 and 10, they illustrate a stepped groove 120 formed in the underside of the slider 10 in proximity to the trailing edge 51.

      The coil assembly 26 is disposed within the groove 120, where it is secured to the lens 24 and the air bearing surface 77 of the slider 10 by means of an adhesive layer 121.

      The groove 120 has a depth "d" that ranges for example between approximately 15 microns and approximately 45 microns, and preferably between approximately 28 microns and approximately 31 microns.

      In a preferred embodiment, the laser diode 1251 is a polarized optical light source such as a 30-40 mW laser diode or a diode-pumped micro-chip laser operating in the visible or near ultraviolet region (preferably in the vicinity of 635 nm).

      In the present exemplary embodiment a phase compensator 1120 is used to compensate for relative phase fluctuations that occur between the inherent dual polarization modes of each of the polarization-maintaining optical fibers 1130 and 1140 (FIG. 13).
      <br/>
      Each of the polarization modes of the optical fibers 1130 and 1140 experiences different refractive indices because of the inherent birefringence of the fibers 1130 and 1140.
      <br/>
      For example, relative phase fluctuations may arise because of a slight variation in a difference between the two refractive indices caused by changes in temperature, pressure, and mechanical motion of each of the optical fibers 1130 and 1140.
      <br/>
      These fluctuations may be sensed by the laser-optics assembly 1110, and before significant changes occur, a feedback servo (not shown) adjusts the phase compensator 1120 to cancel the fluctuation.
      <br/>
      In this way, an optical path formed by the optical fibers 1130 and 1140, to and from the flying MO head 1170, my be treated similar to a free-space optical path in terms of its polarization properties.

      The phase compensator 1120 has a height preferably less than its diameter to provide a low-profile shape suitable for use in a compact magneto-optical storage system with reduced electrical capacitance for faster operation.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The optical fiber 1130 may be attached to the circumference of the phase compensator 1120 with an ultraviolet-caring epoxy or another suitable adhesive.
      <br/>
      Metal electrodes are deposited on flat ends of the cylindrical shell to reduce the capacitance so that a voltage applied across the electrodes induces an expansion of the shell in a radial direction, thereby stretching the optical fiber 1130.
      <br/>
      The stretching action serves to provide phase modulation.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      In order to minimize the mechanical stress on the optical fiber 1130, the diameter of the phase compensator 1120 is preferably greater than a few hundred times the cladding diameter of the optical fiber 1130.

      For example, a fiber cladding diameter of approximately 80 microns corresponds to a phase compensator 1120 diameter in the vicinity of 10 nm to 40 nm.

      In the present exemplary embodiment, the fiber optic switch 1150 (FIG. 13) accepts the SMPM optical fiber 1130 at an input port and routes the optical beam emanating from this fiber 1130 to one of the SMPM optical fibers 1140 at an output port.
      <br/>
      The switching properties of the fiber optic switch 1150 are bidirectional so that the optical beam propagating back to the switch 1150 along any one of the SMPM optical fibers 1140 at the output port may also be routed to the optical fiber 1130 at the input port.

      In the preferred embodiment, there is one SMPM optical fiber 1140 for each FMO head 170, and the fiber optic switch 1150 is used to select the MO head 1170 is active for reading data from, or writing data on the MO storage medium 1180.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      During the writing phase, light is delivered through an individual optical fiber 1140 to a respective FMO head 1170 for the purpose of focally heating a respective surface of a rotating MO storage medium 1180, thereby producing a "hot spot".
      <br/>
      A magnetic coil secured to, or formed on the FMO head 1170 is used to produce a magnetic field, which, in turn, magnetizes the region within the hot spot with a vertical orientation either "up or down".
      <br/>
      Thus, as the MO storage medium 1180 rotates, the applied magnetic field is modulated so as to encode digital data as a pattern of "up or down" magnetic domain orientations.

      During the readout phase, a polarized light beam 14 at a lower intensity is delivered through an SMPM optical fiber 1140 to a respective FMO head 1170 for the purpose of probing or scanning the rotating storage medium 1180 with a focused optical spot.
      <br/>
      Readout is performed in such a way that the magnetization direction of the MO storage medium 1180 at the location of the focused spot alters an optical polarization of the light beam 14 via the magneto-optical Kerr effect.
      <br/>
      In this way, the pattern of "up or down" magnetization orientations representative of the stored digital data modulates the polarization of the light beam 14 reflected from the MO storage medium 1180.

      The reflected light signal from the MO storage medium 1180 then couples back through the FMO head 1170, one of the plurality of SMPM optical fibers 1140, and the fiber optic switch 1150, finally reaching two photodiode detectors 1215 for conversion into electronic format by a differential amplifier 1210.

      Referring now to FIG. 15, each FMO head 1170 includes a slider body (or slider) 1330.

      The FMO head 1170 further includes a groove or channel 1360, a steerable micro-machined mirror 1340, and a magnetic coil 1310.
      <br/>
      The groove 1360 can for example be V-shaped for retaining a SMPM fiber 1350.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      With further reference to FIGS. 16 and 17, the FMO 1170 utilizes the air bearing surface (ABS) 1510 of the slider 1330 that flies above or below a coated upper surface of the MO storage medium 1180.
      <br/>
      A polarized beam of laser light is transmitted through the SMPM optical fiber 1350 to the mirror 1340.
      <br/>
      The axis of the V-groove 1360, and hence the axis of the fiber 350 lying in the groove 1360, is substantially parallel to the medium 1180 surface.
      <br/>
      Light exiting the fiber 1350 is reflected by the mirror 1340 at an average angle of approximately ninety degrees relative to the axis of the optical fiber 1350.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The reflected light is directed through an embedded micro-objective lens such as a GRIN lens 1420.
      <br/>
      Fine tracking and short seeks to adjacent tracks are performed by rotating the mirror 1340 about a rotation axis 1410 (shown in FIG. 16).
      <br/>
      In this way a focused optical spot 1440 (FIG. 16) is scattered back and forth in a direction 1520 (illustrated as an arrow in FIG. 17) which is substantially parallel to the radial direction of the medium 1180.
      <br/>
      As the actuator arm 1160 moves the slider body 1330 back and forth across the surface of the medium 1180, the position of the slider body 1330 may become skewed slightly such that the direction 1520 is not precisely parallel to the radial direction of the MO storage medium 1180.
      <br/>
      Although not precisely parallel, the skew angle is sufficiently small that a substantial component of the scanning direction 1520 lies along the radial direction of the storage medium 180.

      Relocating the position of the SMPM optical fiber 1350 within the groove 1360 effectively adjusts the location of the focal point 1440 of the light beam 14.
      <br/>
      Once the fiber 1350 is positioned for proper focus on the surface of the medium 1180, the fiber 1350 may be secured in place by means of ultraviolet (UV) curing epoxy or similar adhesive.

      The use of a cylindrically shaped GRIN lens 1420 allows the lens 1420 to be inserted easily into the vertical channel 60 the slider body 1330.

      To minimize spherical aberrations and to achieve diffraction-limited focusing, the lens 1420 is polished to assume a plano-convex shape with the convex surface 1650 being a simple spherical shape.
      <br/>
      The height LH 1640 of the lens 1420 depends on a number of factors including the magnitude of the refractive index gradient, the wavelength of the light beam, the numerical aperture of the SMPM fiber 1350, and the desired size of the focused optical spot 1440 as determined by the effective numerical aperture of the lens 1420.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the lens height LH 1640 ranges between approximately 170 microns and approximately 500 microns, the lens radius of curvature ranges between approximately 150 microns and approximately 400 microns, and the lens diameter LD ranges between approximately 200 microns and approximately 500 microns.

      While the FMO head 1170 illustrated in FIGS. 15 through 17 is shown to include a GRIN lens 1420, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that additional objective optics can also be used to enhance the properties of the lens 1420.

      For example, the focusing objective optics may include either an aplanatic lens or a solid immersion lens in conjunction with the GRIN lens 1420.

      The use of such an additional lens element can achieve a larger numerical aperture and hence a smaller size focused optical spot 1440.

      A smaller spot size permits higher areal data densities to be written to and from the MO storage medium 1180.

      Micro-optic lenses made by molding glass or plastic can be used in place of the GRIN lens 1420.

      <br/>
      In a dual aspherical optical design, the light beam 14 is substantially collimated between the two optical elements, allowing a quarter wave plate to be placed between the two elements without additional lenses.

      From a manufacturing perspective, molded lenses are attractive because they can be mass produced at low cost.

      Coarse tracking may be maintained by continuously adjusting a current to an actuator coil (part of the actuator magnet and coil 1145 shown in FIG. 13) for controlling the position of the suspension 1165 while fine trucking may be accomplished by continuously adjusting the angular deflection of the mirror 1340.
      <br/>
      The slider 1330 is secured to the suspension 1165 by means of a flexure 1166.

    <p num="91">
      The use of the steerable micro-machined mirror 1340 is advantageous because it offers a method for a very fast manipulation of an optical beam 14.
      <br/>
      This approach facilitates high-speed track following and short seeks for much improved data access times.
      <br/>
      Such improvements over conventional head technology make possible high areal densities by enabling the use of very narrow track pitches.

      The FMO head 1170 design is intrinsically confocal in nature.
      <br/>
      During readout, the light beam reflected from the MO storage medium 1180 is coupled back into the SMPM optical fiber 1140 which acts as the aperture in a confocal system.
      <br/>
      One of the benefits arising from the use of confocal optics includes very high depth resolution along the optical axis as well as improved transverse resolution.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the confocal system is that light reflected from objective optics surfaces is not collected so that anti-reflection coating may not be necessary.
      <br/>
      This is particularly advantageous in a design that uses an aplanatic lens and a non-zero working distance.
      <br/>
      The high depth resolution allows for very close spacing of the layers in a multi-layer medium with low crosstalk between layers, while the improved transverse resolution provides detection of smaller storage medium marks and sharper storage medium mark edges than would otherwise be the case in a non-confocal system.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      The FMO head 1170 design illustrated herein is representative of one approach for storing information on high-density MO storage media 1180.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various variations of the present invention may be implemented to achieve substantially the same goals.
      <br/>
      For example, various types of fiber optical switches (e.g. micro-mechanical, electro-optical, thermo-optical) may be utilized.
      <br/>
      In addition, the flying FMO head 1170 design my be modified for use with a free space optical input beam, thereby eliminating optical fibers 1140.
      <br/>
      Also, the focusing objective lens does not need to be limited to a GRIN lens 1420 because other micro-objective lenses, such as molded aspheres, holographic lenses, binary or other diffractive optical lenses) can also be utilized.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      The present invention may also be used as a read only or a write once flying optical head, or alternatively as a flying optical head.
      <br/>
      Aspects of the present invention will be recognized by those skilled in the art as applicable to compact disks (CDs) and digital video disks (DVDs).
      <br/>
      Thus, those skilled in the art will also recognize that the present invention has aspects which are applicable to all optical storage systems.
