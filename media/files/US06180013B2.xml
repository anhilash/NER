      A method for removing sediments under sewage water in a sewer includes: introducing a portion of a cable into a sewer from the ground by extending the cable into the sewer through an inlet in the ground accessible to the sewer and out of the sewer through an outlet in the ground communicated with the sewer; lowering the portion of the cable until the portion of the cable is embedded in the sediments; positioning two ends of the cable extending outwardly of the inlet and the outlet on the ground; moving mechanically the cable to stir and suspend the sediments into the sewage water; pumping the suspended sediments from the sewer to the ground through one of the inlet and the outlet; removing the sediments from the sewage water by filtration on the ground; and returning the sewage water to the sewer through the other one of the inlet and the outlet.

    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a method for removing sediments under sewage water in a sewer, more particularly to a sediment-removing method that can be carried out conveniently and quickly.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In the past, with reference to FIG. 1, sediments 18 under sewage water 19 in a sewer 11 are removed by a digger 10.
      <br/>
      Digging a number of large holes 14 (only one is shown in FIG. 1) in the ground or road 12 in order to permit access of the digger 10 into the sewer 11 is required before removing the sediments 18.
      <br/>
      After the sediments 18 are dug out by the digger 10 from the sewer 11 through the large holes 14, the large holes 14 on the road 12 must be closed in preparation for use by the vehicles.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Referring to FIG. 2, a steel plate 15 is disposed on top of support walls 13 that are provided between the sewer 11 and the road 12.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="10">
      With reference to FIG. 3, a first preferred embodiment of a method for removing sediments 43 under sewage water 40 in a sewer 4 according to the present invention is performed as described hereinbelow.
      <br/>
      In the first step of the method, an inlet 42 and an outlet 41 are provided in the ground or road 2 in order to communicate the sewer 4 either by drilling the ground 2 or by opening manhole covers (not shown).
      <br/>
      A steel cable 311 is introduced into the sewer 4 via the inlet 42 and is guided to extend out of the sewer 4 via the outlet 41 by means of a guiding tube 321 of guiding means 32 that is disposed on the ground 2.
      <br/>
      After the cable 311 is extended out of the sewer 4 from the outlet 41, the guiding tube 321 is wound and retracted into the guiding means 32.
      <br/>
      Two guide rollers 45 are connected respectively to lower ends of two upright rods 46 and are lowered respectively through the inlet 42 and the outlet 41 to depress and retain a portion of the cable 31 within the sediments 43.
      <br/>
      A pumping device 33 is disposed on the ground 2, and has a suction pipe 331 extending into sediments 43 though the inlet 42 and an exhaust pipe 332 connected to filtration units 35.
      <br/>
      The filtration units 35 are connected in series, and have a discharge pipe 351 extending into the sewer 4 through the outlet 41.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Two ends of the cable 311 that extend outwardly of the inlet 42 and the outlet 41 in the ground are connected to two winding rollers 312 that are mounted on a winding engine 31.
      <br/>
      The cable 311 is moved by rotating the winding rollers 312 to wind up and unwind the cable 311 on the winding rollers 312.
      <br/>
      As the cable 311 is reciprocated by the winding engine 31, the cable 311 stirs and suspends the sediments 43 into the sewage water 40.
      <br/>
      Preferably, two cone-shaped members 44 are provided respectively in the inlet 42 and the outlet 41 in order to reduce friction between the cable 311 and the inlet 42 and the outlet 41.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the suspended sediments are pumped to the filtration units 35 from the sewer 4 through the suction pipe 331 and the exhaust pipe 332 of the pumping device 33.
      <br/>
      An agitator 9 is mounted on the lower end of the suction pipe 331 in order to further stir the suspended sediments 43 in the sewage water 40 and to form fine sediment particles that can be pumped smoothly to the filtration units 35 through the suction pipe 331.
      <br/>
      Finally, the filtrated sewage water is returned to the sewer 4 through the discharge pipe 351 that extends through the outlet 41 in the ground 2.
      <br/>
      In this way, the sediments 43 in the sewer 4 can be removed.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Referring to FIG. 4, a second preferred embodiment of the method for removing sediments 83 in the sewer 8 according to the present invention is shown.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the steps of the method are the same as those of the method of the first preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      The equipment that is employed in this embodiment is similar to that of the first embodiment and includes a winding engine 71, a steel cable 711, guiding means 72 and filtration units 75.
      <br/>
      The difference between the first and second preferred embodiments resides in that a plurality of a raking elements 5 are connected to the portion of the cable 711 that is embedded in the sediment 83.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Referring to FIG. 5, each of the raking elements 5 includes a body 51 and a fastener 52 lockable on the body 51.
      <br/>
      The body 51 of each of the raking elements 5 has a through hole 53 through which the cable 711 extends.
      <br/>
      The bodies 51 of the raking elements 5 can be secured spacedly on the portion of the cable 711 by means of the fasteners 52, such as locking bolts.
      <br/>
      It is noted that the raking elements 5 are attached to the cable 711 before the portion of the cable 711 is lowered to the sediments 83 and before depressing and retaining the portion of the cable 711 within the sediments 83 by means of two guiding rollers 85.
      <br/>
      The raking elements S rake the sediments 83 in the sewer 8 as the cable 711 is moved in order to facilitate suspension of the sediments 83.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to FIG. 6, a third preferred embodiment of the method according the present invention is shown.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, four opposed pairs of inlets and outlets 42', 41' are provided in the ground to communicate with the sewer.
      <br/>
      Each pair of inlets and outlets 42', 41' has a cable 311' passing therethrough.
      <br/>
      In this way, the area stirred by the cables 311' in the sewer is greater than that stirred by a single cable 311, 711 in the previous embodiments, thereby resulting in an enhanced effect for removing the sediments.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring to FIG. 7, a cylindrical hollow tank 68 connected to a suction pipe 631 of a pumping device (not shown) of a fourth preferred embodiment according to the present invention is shown to include a partition 681 provided therein, upper and lower chambers 682, 683 formed therein and divided by the partition 681, a cylindrical wall 688, first and second openings 684, 686 formed in the cylindrical wall 688 and communicated respectively with the upper and lower chambers 682, 683, and a plurality of apertures 685 formed in the cylindrical wall 688 opposite to the first opening 684.
      <br/>
      The lower end of the suction pipe 631 extends into the lower chamber 683 through the upper chamber 682 and the partition 681.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIG. 8, when in use, the lower chamber 683 of the hollow tank 68 is embedded in the sediments 63 in the sewer (not shown) to permit the sediments 63 to be pumped to the filtration units (not shown) through the suction pipe 631.
      <br/>
      As shown, the upper chamber 682 of the hollow tank 68 is dipped in the sewage water 64, and the first opening 684 is disposed upstream of the apertures 685 in the cylindrical wall 688.
      <br/>
      The flowing direction of the sewage water 64 is indicated by the arrows (A).
      <br/>
      As such, plankton 69 in the sewage water 64 can flow into the upper chamber 682 through the first opening 684 and can be retained within the upper chamber 682.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the suction pipe 631 will not be blocked by the plankton 69.
      <br/>
      After the pumping operation is done, the suction tube 631 is retracted from the sewer to remove the plankton 69 from the upper chamber 682 of the hollow tank 68.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Since no large holes need are needed to be dug in the ground or road and to be closed in the manner described in the prior art, the method for removing sediments under sewage water in a sewer according to the present invention can be carried out conveniently and quickly.</p>
    <p num="18">While the present invention has been described in connection with what is considered the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is understood that this invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments but is intended to cover various arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the broadest interpretations and equivalent arrangements.</p>
