    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a recording technology employing an ink-jet recording method as a means for obtaining pictures, color graphics, or color hard-copies produced from computer graphics, color CRT displays, or the like and; more specifically, to an ink-jet recording technology which can reproduce color images that are faithful to the original, while maintaining clearness and high density.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">An ink-jet recording method has been used for terminal printers of word-processing machines and computers, copying machines, facsimile machines, or the like, due to its low noise, low operational cost, feasibility of downsizing, ease of color recording, and the like.</p>
    <p num="6">Generally, a color ink-jet recording method employs three primary colors, i.e., cyan, magenta, and yellow, and may further add black as a fourth color.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In the conventional ink-jet recording method, it was necessary to use a specific type of paper having an ink absorption layer to obtain a highly developed color-image with no blurring of ink.
      <br/>
      However, due to the recent improvement of ink, plain paper being suitable for ink-jet printing, which is used for printers and copying machines in large quantity, has been put into practical use.
      <br/>
      However, it is widely recognized that the printing quality of plain paper is still inadequate.
      <br/>
      The biggest reason for this deficiency is an incompatibility between the incidence of blurring and recording quality of a black image (particularly, recording quality of black letters), in which the blurring occurs between different color inks, which is referred to as bleeding.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      As disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. -55-29546, quick-drying ink having a high penetration rate on plain paper is generally used to produce a color image on plain paper by means of the ink-jet recording method.
      <br/>
      A high-quality image without bleeding incidence can be obtained by using the above-mentioned ink.
      <br/>
      However, such ink has a low image-density and further tends to allow so-called feathering in which the ink blurs slightly along fibers in paper in the periphery of each color image.
      <br/>
      Even though such feathering may be barely noticeable in a color image area, it is conspicuous in a black image area thereby causing deterioration in printing quality.
      <br/>
      The printing quality becomes poor especially when the black image is formed by black letters which become illegible due in part to a lack of sharpness.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      To overcome the above-described ink inferiority, and to obtain an image having decreased feathering and also having much higher density and high quality, it is necessary to use black ink having a relatively slow penetration rate on plain paper.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, each ink may blur at the adjacent boundary portion of the recording image areas where black and color inks meet.
    </p>
    <p num="10">There is a "trade off" relationship between the prevention of blurring between black ink and color inks and the improvement of quality of the color image obtained by the reduced incidence of feathering in the black image.</p>
    <p num="11">
      According to Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. -4-158049, a combined use of print heads of a plurality of colors for color recording and a print head for letter recording has been proposed, in which the use of these two different heads are switched according to the recording image.
      <br/>
      However, disadvantages such as high cost and the inevitability of large-sized apparatus are unavoidable in this method because the head for letter recording is used in combination with the conventional heads of a plurality of colors for color recording.
    </p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="24">
      According to the present invention, color ink having a characteristic of a high penetration rate (quick fastness) is applied to a recording paper to form a primary coat of black ink having a relatively low penetration rate (slow fastness).
      <br/>
      Therefore, the wettability of the surface of the recording paper is brought to a satisfactory level.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a high-quality color image, which prevents the incidence of bleeding between black ink and color inks, can be obtained by quickening the fastness of black ink, which can be accomplished by forming an interface having a favorable penetration property.
      <br/>
      Especially when a color image is not formed in the surrounding boundary or periphery of a black image forming area, a black image having a high recording density with a reduced incidence of feathering can be formed; and when the color image is formed in an adjacent area of, or by overlapping with, the black image forming area, a superior color image is formed in which the fastness of black ink can be accelerated and bleeding is prevented from occurring between the black and color images.
    </p>
    <p num="25">According to the present invention, a high-quality black image and a high-quality color-image can be compatibly achieved.</p>
    <p num="26">
      In the present invention, the penetration rate can be evaluated by dropping 1  MU l of ink on a recording member (e.g., plain paper) which is then rubbed with a finger.
      <br/>
      When the period of time is short until no smearing occurs on the finger or on the recording member, by the rubbing, the penetration rate is defined as "high."
    </p>
    <p num="27">When an SK paper made by CANON Inc. is employed as plain paper, it is ideal to use color ink having a penetration rate of less than 60 seconds, preferably less than 20 seconds, and black ink having a penetration rate of more than 120 seconds.</p>
    <p num="28">
      When the black image area adjoins the color image area, the terminology "adjacent" is used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      This terminology "adjacent" can be used when at least one color recording-pixel which forms the color image, in contrast with at least one black recording-pixel which forms the black image area on the recording member, can exist within the recording area represented by X * P, wherein P is a minimum pixel pitch of recording and X is a value which satisfies an expression 42 &gt;= X &gt;= 1.
      <br/>
      In terms of the location of adjacent color ink, when X is 1, at least one color recording pixel which forms the color image area exists either on the top, bottom, or sides of the black recording pixel.
      <br/>
      When X is 2, at least one color recording pixel which forms the color image area exists either on the top, bottom, sides, and/or either on the top-right, bottom-right, top-left, bottom-left of the black recording pixel.
      <br/>
      When X is 2 or 22, the same method as above can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Furthermore, in the present invention, a determination of whether a color image area exists or not in an area adjacent to the black image area can be conducted only when the black image area is within an effectively controllable range of a line memory of a recording unit.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the above-described determination cannot be conducted, but color ink is applied in advance on all the areas where black ink is to be applied to form the black image.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      According to the present invention, it is preferable that the ink jetting quantity (volume) per 1 pixel of color ink be less than that of the black ink, more desirably, within a range between 1/3 and 2/3 of the black ink's jetting quantity.
      <br/>
      For instance, when the color-ink jetting quantity is approximately 40 pl, the preferable quantity of black ink is approximately 80 pl.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      When at least one portion of the periphery of the black image area is adjacent to a color image, a black-color unit image can be formed by conducting a plurality of operations of a recording head.
      <br/>
      This printing method is called a split-recording method, and a description thereof will now be given in conjunction with FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 1C.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In the split-recording method, a multi-head 1 has performed its scanning 3 times to completely form the printing area shown in FIG. 1C. However, 4-pixel units or half of the printing area shown in FIG. 1A can be completed by scanning twice.
      <br/>
      The multi-head employed in this method has 8 nozzles which are divided into 2 groups, an upper 4-nozzle group and a lower 4-nozzle group.
      <br/>
      Dots printed by one nozzle at one time form a staggered or laced lattice structure.
      <br/>
      In the first scanning operation by the multi-head, the lower 4 nozzles are used to conduct a printing of dots  *  forming the laced pattern as shown in FIG. 1A. In the second scanning operation, paper is fed by an extent of 4 pixels (half of the head length) to conduct a printing of dots  (small circle)  forming an inversely laced pattern as shown in FIG. 1B. In the third scanning, paper is fed again by 4 pixels to conduct a printing of dots  *  forming a laced pattern again as shown in FIG. 1C. Consequently, a recording area of a 4-pixel unit can be completed in every single scanning operation by means of feeding a paper in every 4-pixel unit and alternately recording the laced and inversely laced patterns sequentially.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The above-mentioned splitting method is already known to those skilled in the art as a method of reducing pattern fluctuation caused by nozzles.
      <br/>
      However, by means of the recording method according to the present invention, the number of adjacent dots can be reduced, thus resulting in advantage of reducing bleeding.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In the present invention, when at least one portion in the periphery of the black image area contacts a color image area, a preferable ratio of the number of adhesive pixels of color ink, which is applied prior to applying black ink, to the total number of pixels of the black image contacting the color image area is within the range of 10%-100%.
      <br/>
      As will be described later, color ink is not necessarily applied, or absorbed on the recording member, as a primary coat for all the black ink, but can be partially removed to an extent in which bleeding does not occur.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, all of the different colors of ink are not necessarily applied to the recording member, but at least one color ink can be applied thereto as a primary coat for black ink if bleeding does not occur.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the purpose of applying color ink in advance of black ink is to provide better wettability to the recording member.
      <br/>
      Therefore, from the viewpoint of controlling color-ink consumption and excessive adhesion of the color ink to paper, it is further preferable to use color ink of a predetermined minimum amount which does not cause bleeding.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Color ink according to the present invention comprises at least one component selected from nonionic-, ionic-, amphoteric-surfactants, and monovalent aliphatic alcohol having 1-7 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Preferable surfactants are ethylene oxide addition-product of alkyl phenyl ether, polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide copolymer, nonionic-surfactant such as ethylene oxide addition-product of acetylene glycol, sulfate or sulfonate anionic surfactant, quaternary amine cationic surfactant, and betaine or amino-acid amphoteric surfactant.
      <br/>
      A preferable adding amount of the surfactant is 1%-20% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="36">As a means for ink-jetting, either an electro-thermal converter or an electro-mechanical converter can be employed.</p>
    <p num="37">A plurality of color inks used in the present invention can be chosen from among yellow, magenta, cyan, red, green, and blue.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLES</heading>
    <p num="38">
      A detailed description of examples of the present invention will now be given in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.
      <br/>
      While the present invention has been described with respect to what is presently considered to be the preferred examples, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed examples.

      A carriage 101 carries a print head 102 and a cartridge guide and travels along guide shafts 104 and 105.
      <br/>
      A recording paper 106 is fed to the inside of the recording apparatus by means of a paper-transfer roller 107, and then the paper 106 is caught by a paper feed roller 108, a pinch roller (not shown), and a platen 109.
      <br/>
      The paper 106 is then transferred to the front side of the paper feed roller 108, where printing is to be conducted.
      <br/>
      There are two ink cartridges, one is a color-ink cartridge 110 containing ink of at least one of three different colors of yellow, magenta, and cyan, and the other is a black ink cartridge 111.
      <br/>
      These cartridges are to be separately inserted in the cartridge guide 103 to communicate with the print head 102.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Yellow, magenta, and cyan inks in the color-ink cartridge 110 have a high penetration rate on the recording paper so as to prevent these inks from blurring in the boundary area of each color when they form a color image.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, black ink in the black ink cartridge 111 has a lower penetration rate on the recording paper than the three aforementioned color inks so as to make the black image have a higher density with higher quality and less ink blurring.

      Each nozzle port is provided with an ink liquid passage with which it communicates.
      <br/>
      A common liquid chamber is provided for supplying ink to each group of the respective liquid passages at the rear portion thereof.

      In the area where ink liquid passages communicate with the corresponding nozzle-ports, there are provided an electro-thermal converter which is employed to discharge a drop of ink from each nozzle port.
      <br/>
      In addition, electrode-wiring to supply power to the converter is also provided therein.

      In step 2, data of Y, M, C, and Bk are expanded to the respective buffers.

      In step 3, a black recording image is expanded to Y-, M-, C-, and Bk(black)-data buffers for color recording.

      In step 4, a recording operation can be conducted by the recording head 102, in which the black recording image can be printed according to Bk-data and Y-, M-, and C-data, thus producing a high-quality image with no bleeding.

    <p num="59">
      In FIG. 6, an additional step 3 is provided in comparison with the example 1 of FIG. 5.

      In this step 3, which concerns black-color data, a determination is made whether there is any color recording data in pixels located adjacent to the periphery of the black image recording area.

      In this case, a pixel pitch P is approximately 79.56  MU m and the recording density is 360 dpi.

      An image part B consists of a black-color graph with a yellow-color background.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      According to example 2, the image part A is formed of only the black color with no background color.
      <br/>
      There is no color recording area which contacts the black recording area; therefore, the black image is formed only of black ink.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the image part B, the entire area surrounding the black image is formed by a color image.
      <br/>
      At least one color ink of the three, i.e., Y-, M-, and C-inks, is applied to the recording paper in advance, and Bk ink is overlaid thereon to form the black image.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      According to example 2, when there is no color image around the black image area, recording is conducted by Bk-ink which has high recording-density and less feathering incidence.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when there is a color image around the black image area, a high-quality color image having no incidence of ink blurring between black ink and color ink can be formed by overlapping C-, M-, Y-, and Bk-inks to form the black image area.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      In example 2, the determination about the presence of the color image area adjacent to the black image area can be processed by means of software.

      <br/>
      The resultant image obtained was much sharper at the area where color inks and black ink were overlapped and exhibited no bleeding therein.

    <p num="71">
      In example 5, where the periphery of the black image area has at least one portion being adjacent to the color image area, an experiment was conducted by varying the number of color-ink adsorbed pixels with a plurality of colors adsorbed on paper before applying black ink.

      <br/>
      In this case, an image having no bleeding incidence was obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      In the black image area shown in FIG. 8C, it can be seen that 2 black pixels form one group, in which there is 1 black pixel in every group being undercoated by different color inks.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the ratio of the black pixels, on which color inks were undercoated, to the total number of black pixels was 50%.
      <br/>
      In the black image area shown in FIG. 8D, it can be seen that 9 black pixels form one group, in which one black pixel, of every group, is undercoated by color ink.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the ratio of the black pixels, on which color inks were undercoated, to the total number of black pixels was 11%.
      <br/>
      In both of the above-mentioned cases, an image having no bleeding therein was obtained.
      <br/>
      In the black image area shown in FIG. 8E, the above-mentioned ratio obtained in the same manner as in FIGS. 8C and 8D was approximately 8%.
      <br/>
      Although some bleeding occurred, it was within a permissible range for practical printing purposes.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is found that a preferable ratio of black pixels, on which color ink/inks are applied in advance, to the total number of pixels of the black image is 10%-100%.

      According to the present invention, a high-quality color image can be obtained in which an incidence of bleeding between black ink and color inks is prevented.
