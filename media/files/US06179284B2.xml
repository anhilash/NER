      A method and a device form a scaled flow of overlapped articles from a flow of individual, flat and elastic articles, e.g. for stacking, without the following articles impacting with the rear edges of the preceding articles.
      <br/>
      In order to achieve a high flow rate, independent of the article length, the respectively preceding article remains during the overlapping in a locally fixed position until the supplied, respectively following article impacts from the side with the preceding article in accordance with the predetermined overlapping length.
      <br/>
      Following this, the two articles as well as all previous articles are jointly transported further until the rear edge of the now last, preceding article has reached the locally fixed position according to the predetermined overlapping length.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention relates to a method and a device for forming a scaled flow of overlapped flat articles, which are supplied and removed with their longitudinal sides positioned between side mounted guide means.</p>
    <p num="2">The overlapping of articles is advantageous, for example, for the space-saving transport of the articles in sorting machines or the secure stacking in stacking compartments where a following article is to be prevented from bumping into the rear edge of a preceding article.</p>
    <p num="3">
      A solution has become known (DE 37 23 259 C2), which provides in addition to the main conveying track a secondary conveying track with diverters to prevent a backing up of the articles during the stacking in.
      <br/>
      This arrangement calls for the overlapping of two successive articles.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Two variants are possible here:</p>
    <p num="5">
      1.
      <br/>
      A second article takes a shorter path as compared to a first article, as a result of which a varied degree of overlapping can be achieved when the articles converge, depending on the length of the article and the gap.
      <br/>
      2. A second article is transported at a higher speed, relative to a first article.
      <br/>
      If the speed can be controlled, then a constant overlapping can be achieved when the articles converge.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      However, a continuous scaled flow cannot be produced with this.
      <br/>
      An additional disadvantage is the relatively high expenditure.
      <br/>
      In the operational sequence sorter SLS for letters, manufactured by the company Elsag Bailey, Genoa, a continuous or a discontinuous flow of individual articles is taken over by a second conveying system.
      <br/>
      This system operates in the start-stop mode with constant intervals.
      <br/>
      In the course of this, the following article is deposited on the preceding article in such a way that the front edge of the articles is always stopped in the same position and subsequently, the resulting scale is moved forward by a constant distance.
      <br/>
      The resulting scaled flow thus has a constant spacing between the front edges of the articles.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In order to prevent bumping against the rear edges of the preceding articles during the overlapping, the articles must arrive at the second conveying system at a pointed angle, wherein the rear edges of the articles must leave the resulting entry triangle in a timely fashion.</p>
    <p num="8">Owing to the fact that articles with a varying format are to be processed, a correspondingly large gap must exist, oriented toward the long articles with their large, empty surfaces since the rear edges of the long articles leave the entry triangle only relatively slowly as a result of their inherent mass inertia and stiffness, thereby resulting in a low flow rate, or a correspondingly involved auxiliary device must be used to ensure that the rear edges clear the entry triangle quickly, e.g. a stacking spindle (DE-OS 33 17 865) or a contact pressure roller (DE-OS 37 00 827).</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The invention pertains to a method and a device for forming a scaled flow of overlapped articles from a flow of individual, flat, elastic articles, which method and device permit a high flow rate with low apparatus expenditure.
      <br/>
      The invention pertains to a method and device for forming a scaled flow of overlapped, flat articles from a flow of individual, flat and elastic articles which are supplied and removed with longitudinal edges thereof positioned between side-mounted guide means, and includes feeding a preceding article in a feeding direction; holding the preceding article immovable at a clamping region in a removal direction at an angle to the feeding direction, and with a rear edge of the preceding article at a fixed distance from the clamping region, so a rear section of the proceeding article pivots from the being oriented in the feeding direction to being oriented in the removal direction; and feeding a following article in the feed direction to impact with the preceding article, wherein the following article does not reach the rear edge of the preceding article until the rear section of the preceding article has pivoted to being oriented in the removal direction.
      <br/>
      Both the preceding and following articles are fed together until the following article is held immovable as a respective preceding article in the holding step above.
    </p>
    <p num="10">An advantage of the invention is that independent of the length of the article, the overlapping length is always uniform, owing to the selection of the rear edges as reference value for the control.</p>
    <p num="11">The free rear section of the preceding article is selected short enough so that the entry triangle is formed as quickly as possible owing to the elasticity of the article, but that bumping into the rear edges of the preceding articles is avoided at the same time.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In an embodiment of the invention, the preceding article is set into motion with the scaled flow just before the following article arrives, so that at the point of impact, the articles move at the same speed.
      <br/>
      This prevents the articles from backing up.
      <br/>
      An embodiment which uses guide belts, is designed to be operationally safe and cost-saving.
    </p>
    <p num="13">An embodiment of the invention provides a light barrier for detecting the stop signal and the start signal for the driven deflection roller is arranged inside the guide means for feeding in order to avoid installation problems.</p>
    <p num="14">The invention is explained in further detail in the following with the aid of an exemplary embodiment and the drawings.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>

      <br/>
      FIG. 2 shows a side view of the device with the drive region, at the point in time when it is stopped.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows a side view of the device with the drive region, at the time of entry for the following article.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="16">A guide belt system functioning as feed means 3 and consisting of elastic guide belts that are guided over deflection rollers, guides the individually following articles 2 toward the device.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The device consists of a first guide belt 4, which transports the overlapped articles to an end stop 6.
      <br/>
      This guide belt 4 is operated in the start-stop mode via a deflection roller 5, on the side facing away from the stacking location.
      <br/>
      A second, endless guide belt 7 that is guided over two deflection rollers is located at the deflection roller 5 and is also directed toward the stacking location.
    </p>
    <p num="18">This second guide belt projects over the first guide belt, counter to the stacking movement, so as to support the rear section of the preceding article.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The rear edge of the article is respectively detected with a light barrier Li.
      <br/>
      When reaching the position 1, the article is stopped regardless of the article length.
      <br/>
      When in the position 1, the distance of the rear edge from the point of impact of the following article coincides with the specified overlap.
      <br/>
      The stop signal is derived from the light-barrier signal of the rear edge, whereas the start signal is derived from the light-barrier signal of the front edge by taking into account the transporting speed and the distance of light barrier Li.
      <br/>
      The deflection roller 5 thus is operated in the stop-start mode, causing the first belt 4 to be operated in the stop-start mode as well.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The last article 1 of the scaled flow is clamped in the clamping region around the point K. As a result of this, the free length s of article 1 which projects from the first guide belt 4 does not depend on the article length.
      <br/>
      If the first guide belt 4 is started via the deflection roller 5 at the moment of impact of the following article 2, then the free length s corresponds to the constant overlapping length c. However, the articles 1, 2 can back up during this process.
      <br/>
      In order to avoid this, the guide belt 4 is started shortly before the article 2 impacts, so that at the moment of impact, both articles 1, 2 have approximately the same speed.

      To ensure that the distance between impact point and rear edge corresponds at the moment of impact to the overlapping length c, the free length s for the resting article 1 must be longer by the necessary measure.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The inherent stiffness of the articles, even of very unstable articles, is sufficient so that after the rear edge of the article 1 leaves the feeding means 3, this rear edge jumps within a very short time from position 1 to position 2 where it rests against the guide band 7.
      <br/>
      As a result, the entry triangle is cleared quickly for the following article 2.
    </p>
    <p num="22">If the front edge of the following article 2 has reached the position 3, then the first guide belt 4 is started as described, so that it runs at rated speed when the following article 2 is taken over from the guide belt 4.</p>
    <p num="23">The angle  ALPHA  and the free length s define a right triangle (entry triangle), the cathetus d of which should not fall below a minimum measure to prevent the following article 2 from impacting with the preceding article 1, even if the edges are turned over, etc . . . The entry triangle must exist at the time when the following article 2 starts to move along the hypotenuse, that is to say when the rear edge of the preceding article 1 is in position 2 (not inside the entry triangle).</p>
    <p num="24">The preceding article 1 and the following article 2 are conveyed with a constant overlap c between the guide belts 4 and 7 until the guide band 4 stops, which is triggered by the rear edge of the following article 2.</p>
    <p num="25">
      As a result, a flow of articles with constant overlap c is produced, which moves in intervals toward the stop 6, thereby causing the articles to glide one on top of the other and form a stack.
      <br/>
      The geometry must be selected such that even the shortest article always remains clamped in and that the overlap cannot disappear.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Owing to the stop-start mode of guide belt 4 and thus also the non-driven second guide belt 7, the upright standing article remains for a very short time on the running elements, so that no damage can occur.</p>
