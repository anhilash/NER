      A fully redundant drawworks is provided with two complete and totally independent systems for controlling and powering the drum and drum shaft of the drawworks.
      <br/>
      Each system broadly comprises at least one source of power (e.g., a motor or engine), a power transmission means, preferably of the gear or chain type, and some means of mechanically coupling the power source, transmission and drum shaft together.
      <br/>
      Each system may also be provided with a brake means, such as one or more disc, band, electric or water-cooled brakes.
      <br/>
      In the event that any component of either system fails, the fully redundant drawworks will still have the ability to raise drill pipe from a bore hole and thus avoid the risk of a "stuck" drill pipe.

    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates generally to oil field equipment, and more particularly to an improved drawworks.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      A drawworks, sometimes referred to as a hoist, is a large piece of oil field equipment which can broadly be described as a very large winch.
      <br/>
      The drawworks is mounted on an oil or gas well drilling rig, its sole function being to raise and lower drill pipe and casing into and out of the bore hole.
      <br/>
      Typically, a drawworks is provided with: a hollow drum which is coaxially mounted on a drum shaft; a source of power to cause the drum shaft and drum to rotate; some means of transmitting power from the power source to the drum shaft; and, some means of braking the drum.
      <br/>
      The drawworks is mounted on the drilling rig such that the longitudinal center axis of the drum and drum shaft is coplanar with the drilling rig platform, or horizontal.
      <br/>
      Examples of the power source are AC motors, DC motors, and diesel or other types of engines.
      <br/>
      The power is generally transmitted from the power source to the drum shaft either by (1) a chain transmission mechanism or (2) a gear transmission mechanism.
      <br/>
      The drum can be braked in a number of ways, examples of which are by disc brakes, band brakes, water-cooled brakes, electric brakes, or by the power source.
      <br/>
      The drum is wrapped with a length of wireline, normally not provided with the drawworks.
      <br/>
      The wireline is fed upwardly from the drawworks to the top of the oil derrick and then downwardly such that it can be attached to the drill pipe or casing.
      <br/>
      Between the top and bottom of the derrick, the wireline is passed through a series of sheaves (or pulleys), which are housed within a crown block and traveling block.
      <br/>
      The lowermost end of the wireline is attached to a hook and swivel arrangement, to which the drill pipe and casing may be releasably attached, and thereby raised and lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Problems can arise with conventional drawworks of the type described above.
      <br/>
      One very serious problem, which the present invention is believed to solve, arises in the event that one of the components of the drawworks fails.
      <br/>
      The most common failures are mechanical in nature, and occur either in the power source (motor or engine) or in the gear or chain mechanism.
      <br/>
      In the event that such a mechanical failure occurs, the drawworks will become completely disabled, and thus unable to perform its function.
      <br/>
      If the failure can be quickly remedied, and the drawworks quickly restored to operation, then no problems should arise.
      <br/>
      However, in the event that the failure is of such a serious nature that it cannot be quickly remedied, such that the entire drilling operation must be halted for a period of time, then it is almost inevitable that the drill pipe will become "stuck" in the bore hole.
      <br/>
      The drill pipe becomes "stuck" because, after sitting in the same position for an extended period of time, rock, dirt and other debris tends to cave in around the pipe and on top of the drilling bit, which is attached to the lowermost end of the drill pipe.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the oil well drilling industry know that a "stuck" drill pipe can be disastrous and extremely expensive to remedy, and could potentially lead to the bore hole being completely abandoned.
      <br/>
      The drawworks of the present invention was developed to reduce the risk of the drill pipe becoming "stuck." As will be more fully described below, the drawworks of the present invention is provided with complete redundancy, which means that if a mechanical failure occurs, the drawworks will still have the ability to raise the drill pipe out of the well hole, or at least up into the casing, before the drill pipe becomes "stuck."

      <br/>
      Thus, in the event that any motor, gear box, coupler or brake fails, the drawworks will still have the ability to raise the drill pipe out of the bore hole, or at least up into the casing, before the drill pipe becomes "stuck," thereby avoiding a very expensive and troublesome situation.
      <br/>
      In addition to significantly reducing the risk of a "stuck" pipe, the full redundancy provided with the drawworks of the present invention has the additional benefit of allowing the drilling crew to service or conduct preventative maintenance on one of the two systems without requiring the entire drilling operation to be halted.
      <br/>
      The drawworks can be made redundant by providing each system with single motors, and with chain transmissions instead of gear transmissions.

      The gear boxes 20 and 22 of this specific embodiment may be of the type custom-manufactured by Bradfoote Gear Works, Inc., of Cicero, Ill., such as Model No. 2PH4100-3S-21.
      <br/>
      Suitable gear boxes could also be provided by manufacturers such as: Philadelphia Gear, of King of Prussia, Pa.; Amarillo Gear, of Amarillo, Tex.; Western Gear Corporation, of Everett, Wash.; Luflkin Gear, of Lufkin, Tex., or Horsburgh &amp; Scott, of Cleveland, Ohio.
      <br/>
      In another specific embodiment, the gear boxes 20 and 22 could be provided as single or multiple-speed transmissions instead of as three-speed transmissions.
      <br/>
      With reference to FIG. 3, which shows the left side of the left gear box 20 partially cut away, it can be more clearly seen that the upper left motor 30 is positioned above the lower left motor 28 and nearer to the drum 14.
      <br/>
      The upper right motor 34 and the lower right motor 32 are configured in the same manner.
      <br/>
      This aspect of the drawworks can also be seen with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 is a side view of the left side of the left gear box 20, and FIG. 5 is an end view, looking toward the front of the drawworks 10, of the left gear box 20 as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The dashed, circular lines in FIG. 4 represent the three-speed gear arrangement and illustrate the manner in which the gears mesh with one another.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the left gear box 20 includes a collector gear drive 46, an upper multiple-speed gear transmission 48, and a lower multiple-speed gear transmission 50.
      <br/>
      The collector gear drive 46 is coupled to the upper and lower multiple-speed gear transmissions 48 and 50, and to the drum 14.
      <br/>
      The upper multiple-speed gear transmission 48 is coupled to the upper left motor 30, and the lower multiple-speed gear transmission 50 is coupled to the lower left motor 28.
      <br/>
      The right gear box 22 is constructed and connected to the upper and lower right motors 32 and 34 in like manner.
      <br/>
      As noted hereinabove, the drum shaft 16 runs the full length of the drawworks 10 and passes through each of the respective shaft bores provided within the left brake 24, the left gear box 20, the drum mounting frame 18, the drum 14, the right gear box 22, and the right brake 26.
      <br/>
      From FIG. 4, it can be seen that the shaft bore of the left gear box 20 is denoted by numeral 44.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As best shown in FIG. 1, left motors 28 and 30 are coupled to the input shafts 35 and 37 of left gear box 20 by mechanical couplers 36 and 38, respectively.
      <br/>
      Similarly, right motors 32 and 34 are coupled to the input shafts 39 and 41 of right gear box 22 by mechanical couplers 40 and 42, respectively.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, each coupler 36-42 may be a flexible gear-type coupling, of the "Waldron" type manufactured by Kop-Flex, Inc., of Baltimore, Md.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, each motor 28-34 may be a General Electric model GE-752 shunt wound high torque electric motor, each of which is rated at 1,365 horsepower.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the drawworks 10 could be provided with two motors (not shown) instead of four, as shown in FIG. 1, in which case the gear boxes 20 and 22 would be provided with one input shaft each (not shown), instead of two, as shown in FIGS. 1, 4, and 5.
      <br/>
      Thus, motors 28 and 30 could be replaced with a single motor of greater horsepower, and motors 32 and 34 could likewise be replaced with a single motor of greater horsepower, if desired.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      It is important that any drawworks be provided with sufficient braking capability to control the rotation of its drum as the wireline is being fed out to lower the drill pipe or casing.
      <br/>
      Without sufficient braking capability, due to the weight of the drill pipe and casing, the drum could freewheel out of control and thereby permit the wireline to drop at great speed, which could damage the drill pipe and casing.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the power source, such as the motors 28-34, may be provided with such braking capability.
      <br/>
      However, in other embodiments, it may be necessary to provide the drawworks with additional braking capability, such as in the form of one or more band brakes, disc brakes, electric brakes, or water-cooled brakes, for example.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the specific embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-3, the drawworks 10 is provided with left and right brakes 24 and 26.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, brakes 24 and 26 may be Eaton model 436WCB water-cooled brakes.
      <br/>
      As best shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the left and right brakes 24 and 26 are directly coupled to the left and right gear boxes 20 and 22, respectively.
      <br/>
      As best shown in FIG. 3, the drum shaft 16 is rotatably mounted within the shaft bore of the left brake 24, and the brake 24 is securely mounted to the skid 12.
      <br/>
      In another specific embodiment, the drawworks 10, if desired, could be provided with electric or disc brakes in place of water-cooled brakes.
      <br/>
      In yet another specific embodiment, the length of the drawworks 10 could be shortened by completely removing the brakes 24 and 26, and instead providing braking capability to the drawworks 10 by mounting disc or drum brakes (not shown) to the drum within the drum housing 18 at the positions indicated by numerals 24' and 26' in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The total estimated weight of the specific embodiment of the drawworks shown in FIGS. 1-3 may be approximately 170,000 pounds.
      <br/>
      The drawworks 10 is provided with appropriate electrical and/or mechanical systems (not shown) to enable a oil rig worker to control the motors and other components of the drawworks 10.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the drawworks 10 may be provided with complete oil bath lubrication, in a conventional manner.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Having described the drawworks 10 of the present invention in various embodiments, it should now be understood that the drawworks 10 of the present invention is fully redundant, meaning that the drawworks 10 is provided with two complete, separate and independent systems for powering and controlling the drum 14, those two systems being: (1) the left system, which broadly comprises motors 28 and 30, gear box 20, couplers 36 and 38, and brake 24; and (2) the right system, which broadly comprises motors 32 and 34, gear box 22, couplers 40 and 42, and brake 26.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the event that any motor, gear box, coupler or brake fails, the drawworks 10 will still have the ability to raise the drill pipe out of the bore hole, or at least up into the casing, before the drill pipe becomes "stuck," thereby avoiding a very expensive and troublesome situation.
      <br/>
      In addition to significantly reducing the risk of a "stuck" pipe, the full redundancy provided with the drawworks of the present invention has the additional benefit of allowing the drilling crew to service or conduct preventative maintenance on one of the two systems without requiring the entire drilling operation to be halted.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the exact details of construction, operation, exact materials or embodiments shown and described, as obvious modifications and equivalents will be apparent to one skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, while the drawworks as hereinabove described has been made redundant by providing same with dual gear transmissions, it is within the scope of this invention to provide a redundant drawworks by providing same with dual chain transmissions.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the invention is therefore to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims.
