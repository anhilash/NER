      A boron and silicon oxynitride obtained by preparing a polyborosiloxane precursor, conducting nitriding pyrolysis of the precursor to obtain an amorphous boron and silicon oxynitride, and optionally conducting additional pyrolysis to obtain a crystallized boron and silicon oxynitride.
      <br/>
      The polyborosiloxane precursor is prepared by condensation, in the presence of a catalyst, of (2) a polychlorosilane represented by the formula R3R4SiCl2 in which the substituents R3 and R4 are identical or different and each represents a hydrogen atom, a chlorine atom, a linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl or alkynyl radical having 5 or less carbon atoms, or an aryl or aralkyl radical having 6 to 18 carbon atoms, with (2) an alkyl borate represented by the formula (R5O)3B in which R5 represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having 1 to 5 carbon atoms.

      Field of Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a method for preparing silicon and boron oxynitrides.
      <br/>
      The present invention also relates to the silicon and boron oxynitrides obtained and the polyborosiloxanes obtained as intermediates in such a process.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A number of compounds are known that are refractory ceramics, for example silicon Si3 N4 and silicon oxynitride.
      <br/>
      Such materials are useful for their mechanical properties at high temperatures, particularly their resistance to heat impact, to corrosion, and to oxidation.
      <br/>
      In addition, boron nitride has a low density, a high melting point, a high thermal conductivity, and chemical inertia.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      These materials can be obtained in various forms, particularly in the form of fibers or films, by the organometallic method for example.
      <br/>
      However, the mechanical properties of silicon nitride fibers degrade when they are (1) subjected to a temperature higher than 1400 (degree)  C. due to crystallization of Si3 N4, or (2) placed in an oxidizing environment which brings about chemical transformation.
    </p>
    <p num="6">

      These materials combined good thermomechanical properties with exceptional oxidation resistance at high temperatures.

      However, these materials are either precursors of materials in which Si3 N4 is the essential component and have the aforementioned drawbacks or they are obtained from precursors of the insoluble and/or nonmelting polyborosiloxane type as described, for example, by L.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">The present invention is directed to a method for preparing a boron and silicon oxynitride comprising (1) a first step in which a polyborosiloxane precursor is prepared, (2) a second step in which nitriding pyrolysis of the precursor is conducted to obtain an amorphous boron and silicon oxynitride, and (3) optionally a third step in which additional pyrolysis is conducted to obtain a crystallized boron and silicon oxynitride.</p>
    <p num="11">The polyborosiloxane is prepared by condensation, in the presence of a catalyst, of (1) a polychlorosilane represented by the formula R3 R4 SiCl2 in which substituents R3 and R4 are identical or different and each represents a hydrogen atom, a chlorine atom, a linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl or alkynyl radical having 5 or less carbon atoms, or an aryl or aralkyl radical having 6 to 18 carbon atoms, with (2) an alkyl borate represented by the formula (R5 O)3 B in which R5 represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having 1 to 5 carbon atoms.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING</heading>
    <p num="12">FIG. 1 represents an infrared spectrum of poly(borosiloxane) obtained by the present invention (curve a) and the infrared spectrum of a poly(borosiloxane) obtained by polycondensation of methyldichlorosilane with boric acid (curve b).</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="13">
      It is known that a monochlorosilane, namely triethylmonochlorosilane, can be condensed with methyl borate.
      <br/>
      However, the reactivity of the chlorine atoms of a dichlorosilane is generally significantly different from that of the chlorine atom of a monochlorosilane.
      <br/>
      For example, in the presence of basic catalysts such as dimethylcyanamide or hexamethylphosphorotriamide, HMeSiCl2 dismutes into MeSiCl3 and H2 MeSiCl while the corresponding monochlorosilane HMe2 SiCl does not react.
      <br/>
      Hence, it is not obvious to transpose the reactions known for a monochlorosilane to treatment of a polychlorosilane.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In the polychlorosilane R3 R4 SiCl2, the substituents R3 and R4 are identical or different and each represents a hydrogen atom, a chlorine atom, a linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl or alkynyl radical having 5 or less carbon atoms, or an aryl radical or an aralkyl radical having 6 to 18 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      In embodiments, polychlorosilanes in which R3 and R4 represent H, Cl, a methyl radical, or an ethyl radical are preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The catalyst used for the condensation reaction of polychlorosilane with alkyl borate can be a Lewis acid (for example, TiCl4 or AlCl3) or a transition metal chloride (for example, CuCl2, FeCl3, SnCl2, CoCl2, or NiCl2).
      <br/>
      In embodiments, FeCl3 is preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Alkyl borate is preferably chosen from compounds represented by (R5 O)3 B in which R5 represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as a methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, amyl, or isoamyl radical.
      <br/>
      Methyl borate and ethyl borate are particularly preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="17">The condensation reaction of polychlorosilane with alkyl borate is effected preferably at a temperature of between approximately 50 (degree)  C. and approximately 100 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="18">A poly(borosiloxane) obtained at the end of the first step in the method of the invention by condensing a polychlorosilane and alkyl borate is constituted of a network formed of .tbd.Si--O--B.dbd. chains represented by the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="19">and it may contain residual .dbd.B--O--R5 groups which are more stable than .dbd.B--O--H groups.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The polyborosiloxane is also characterized by its IR spectrum.
      <br/>
      In this IR spectrum, the absorption peak at approximately 3200 cm-1 (which corresponds to .nu.--OH) is at most equal to the absorption peak at approximately 2960 cm-1 (which corresponds to .nu.--CH).
      <br/>
      In contrast, the IR spectrum of a polyborosiloxane obtained by polycondensation of a polychlorosilane and boric acid has an absorption peak at approximately 3200 cm-1 which represents at least double the absorption peak at approximately 2960 cm-1.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In the second step of the method according to the present invention, a poly(borosiloxane) obtained in the first step is subjected to nitriding pyrolysis to form an amorphous boron and silicon oxynitride.
      <br/>
      Nitriding pyrolysis is conducted in a closed container from which oxygen is excluded under a stream of gaseous ammonia at a temperature greater than approximately 1000 (degree)  C. In embodiments, a temperature lower than approximately 1300 (degree)  C. is particularly preferred.
      <br/>
      The temperature rise rate is preferably between 0.5 (degree)  C. min and 50 (degree)  C./min.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The boron and silicon oxynitrides obtained after nitriding pyrolysis are essentially amorphous solid materials that can be represented by the following formula: SiBy Ny+x/3 02-x/3, with 0.1 &lt;= x  &lt;= 1.3 and 0.01 &lt;= y  &lt;= 2.</p>
    <p num="23">
      After additional pyrolysis at 1600 (degree)  C. in a neutral atmosphere (under nitrogen for example), a partially crystallized solid is obtained in which the Si2 N2 O, the BN phase, and the Si3 N4 phase can be identified, and which can be represented by the following formula: (Si2 N2 O)m (BN)n (Si3 N4)p, with 0 &lt;= m &lt;= 0.5, 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 0.3, and 0 &lt;= p &lt;= 0.5. The three phases are not necessarily present simultaneously.
      <br/>
      Their relative proportions vary for example with the Si/B ratio in the poly(borosiloxane) precursor.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The present invention is illustrated by the following examples which are not limiting in nature.
      <br/>
      Examples 1-8 illustrate preparation of a poly(borosiloxane) by polycondensation of a polychlorosilane and an alkyl borate.
      <br/>
      The yield indicated in the examples represents: (weight of product obtained)  * 100/(theoretical weight corresponding to quantitative elimination of alkyl chloride).
