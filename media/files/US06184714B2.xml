      A current mode data communication system is disclosed.
      <br/>
      The current mode data communication system has a transmitter to simultaneously transmit two digital data bits.
      <br/>
      The two digital data bits are combined to form a current mode signal.
      <br/>
      The current mode signal has a first positive current, a second positive current, a first negative current and a first positive current.
      <br/>
      The current mode signal will be transmitted on a double bit current mode bus.
      <br/>
      Further the current mode communication system has a receiver coupled to the double bit current mode bus to receive the current mode signal and convert the current mode signal to a unextracted form of the two digital data bits.
      <br/>
      The output of the receiver is connected to a data extractor circuit extract the two digital data bits for the unextracted form of the two digital data bits.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relate to systems and circuits for the transmission of multiple digital data bits simultaneously on a single transmission medium between a transmitter and a receiver.
      <br/>
      More particularly this invention relates to a current mode multiple bit data bus to transmit and receive multiple digital data bits on a single transmission medium.

    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Typically, when two or more signals are routed in parallel over significant distances a data bus structure is often used.
      <br/>
      These distances may be on the order of from 1 mm to more than 20 mm of aluminum metalization on semiconductor chips, to as much as a meter of wiring pattern on a printed circuit card, to many meters of transmission line cabling to cover long distances.
      <br/>
      Often the data bus will contain two Wires per signal transmission to have a differential signal to improve speed of the bus.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The important parameters or "figures of merit" for a data bus include: bandwidth of data transmission (bits per wire per second), power consumed (especially the AC power consumed by charging and discharging the data bus capacitances), and chip area consumed per bit versus the length of the distance of the transmission.
      <br/>
      There has been much discussion in the literature that the speed of the data bus, rather than the intrinsic CMOS gate speed, dominates chip performance beyond about 0.35  MU m technology.
      <br/>
      The reason that the transmission speed is the dominating factor is simply that the aluminum wires are getting narrower, and chips are simultaneously getting physically larger.
      <br/>
      So the total resistance of the wires is going up since the wires are becoming longer and narrower.
      <br/>
      In addition to the longer wire length the separation between metal lines is also getting smaller which further increases the capacitance between lines.
      <br/>
      The net change is that the wiring delay due to the resistive-capacitive delay is increasing.
      <br/>
      The above mentioned differential structure of bus allow smaller voltage swings and consequently fewer resistive-capacitive delays.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One known method for reducing wiring delays is to send the signal as a current rather than a voltage signal.
      <br/>
      In this case the voltage on the bus wire does not change drastically during the signal transition, but the current through the wire is modulated.
      <br/>
      Since the voltage is not changed, the resistive-capacitive delay is not a factor is the transmission time.
      <br/>
      The delay for the bus is now the inherent speed of light delay of the transmission medium, which will be much less than the resistive-capacitive delay.

      The subcircuit consisting of the differential amplifier Op1 and the feedback transmission gate X1 formed by the N-type MOS transistor M8 and the P-type MOS transistor M7.
      <br/>
      The transmission gate X1 is always ON, so the output differential amplifier Op1 is resistively fed back to its noninverting input (-).
      <br/>
      This is a well known connection for feedback tracking circuits--the feedback tries to maintain the voltage V(-) at the inverting input terminal (-), equal to the voltage V(+) at the noninverting input terminal (+).
      <br/>
      For instance, if the voltage V(-) were greater than the voltage V(+), the output of the differential amplifier Op1 would swing negative, and current would flow through the transmission gate X1 to try to bring V(-) more negative.
      <br/>
      In the case of FIG. 3, this means that the differential amplifier Op1, the transmission gate X1 work together to try to hold the voltage V(-) equal the voltage V(+) equal to the reference voltage source Vref.
      <br/>
      The operation for differential amplifier Op2, and the transmission gate X2 is similar to that above described for the differential amplifier Op1 and the feedback transmission gate X1.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The current in the current mode bus CMB current is zero.
      <br/>
      Then the subcircuit composed of the differential amplifier Op1 and the feedback transmission gate X1 would be able to hold the voltage of the current mode bus V(CMB) equal to the reference voltage source Vref, as per the preceding discussion.
      <br/>
      In fact, in this state, no current needs to flow in transmission gate X1, so the voltage drop across transmission gate X1 is zero, and the voltage V( ALPHA ) at the output of the differential amplifier Op1 is equal to the voltage V(CMB) of the current mode bus CMB which will be equal to the reference voltage source Vref.
      <br/>
      Given these bias voltages, the transmission gate X3 OFF, so the subcircuit differential amplifier Op2, and the transmission gate X2 is isolated from the current mode bus CMB, and is also able to hold the voltage V(-) at the inverting input (-) at the voltage reference source Vref with no current flowing in the transmission gate X2.
      <br/>
      So, the voltage V( BETA ) at the output of the differential amplifier Op2 is equal to the reference voltage source Vref, also.
      <br/>
      Thus, the voltage V( ALPHA ) is equal to the voltage V( BETA ) is equal to the voltage V(CMB) of the current mode bus is equal to the reference voltage source Vref is the quiescent state of the circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Now, if the current transmitter of FIG. 2 causes a current to flow in the current mode bus CMB, the consequence of the current is the attempt to change the voltage V(CMB) on the current mode bus CMB.

      For example, suppose I+1 is caused to flow from the high supply voltage source Vcc1 into the current mode bus CMB.
      <br/>
      The voltage V(CMB) will tend to go positive.
      <br/>
      As soon as this happens, the change in bias for the differential amplifier Op1 will force the voltage V( ALPHA ) at the output of the differential amplifier Op1 to go more negative to try to compensate the rise in the voltage V(CMB).
      <br/>
      The MOS transistors M1 and M7/M8 of the transmission gate X1 are ratioed such that the current caused by b1TX going to the second logic level (1) is approximately equal to the current through the transmission gate X1 with the voltage V( ALPHA ) at the output of the differential amplifier Op1 equal to the low supply voltage source Vss2 and the voltage V(CMB) on the current mode bus CMB equal to the reference voltage source Vref.
      <br/>
      So the voltage V( ALPHA ) at the output of the differential amplifier Op1 goes to near the low supply voltage source Vss2 which causes P-type MOS transistor M12 to turn ON.
      <br/>
      However, the differential amplifier Op1, and the transmission gate X1 subcircuit has absorbed all the current from the current transmitter, therefore no current remains to pass through causes P-type MOS transistor M12.
      <br/>
      Thus the voltage V( BETA ) at the output of the differential amplifier Op2 remains undisturbed at the reference voltage source Vref.
      <br/>
      This state corresponds to the second line of Table 4, below,  ALPHA =0,  BETA =Vref.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Now, suppose I+2 in FIG. 2 were added to I+1 because b2TX was brought the second logic level (1).
      <br/>
      Since we have chosen the first transmission gate X1 such that the voltage V( ALPHA ) at the output of the differential amplifier Op1 is equal to the low supply voltage source Vss2 response to the current I+1, there is no more current available from the differential amplifier Op1, and the transmission gate X1 to respond to the additional current I+2.
      <br/>
      That is, the subcircuit formed by the differential amplifier Op1 and the transmission gate X1 has reached its "compliant limit," and can sink no more current than I+1 from the current mode bus CMB.
      <br/>
      Since the P-type MOS transistor M12 is ON, the additional current I+2 will flow through it to activate the subcircuit formed by the differential amplifier Op2 and the transmission gate X2.
      <br/>
      This circuit responds in the symmetrically expected way by forcing the voltage V( BETA ) at the output of the differential amplifier Op2 to a more negative voltage in response to I+2.
      <br/>
      Again, we size the P-type MOS transistor M9 and the N-type MOS transistor M10 so that when the voltage V( BETA ) at the output of the differential amplifier Op2 is equal to the low supply voltage source Vss2, the current of approximately I+2 is flowing.
      <br/>
      So for the current mode bus CMB having a current of (I+1 +I+2), we see that the voltage V( ALPHA ) is equal to the voltage V( BETA ) is equal to the level of the low supply voltage source Vss2, which is the third line in Table 4.
      <br/>
      That is  ALPHA =0,  BETA =0.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Now, suppose I-1 is caused to flow to the high supply voltage source Vss1 from the current mode bus CMB.
      <br/>
      The voltage V(CMB) will tend to go negative with respect to the reference voltage source Vref.
      <br/>
      As soon as this happens, the change in bias for the differential amplifier Op1 will force the voltage V( ALPHA ) at the output of the differential amplifier Op1 to go more positive to try to compensate the decrease in the voltage V(CMB).
      <br/>
      The MOS transistors M2 and M7/M8 of the transmission gate X1 are ratioed such that the current caused by b1TX going to the first logic level (0) is approximately equal to the current through the transmission gate X1 with the voltage V( ALPHA ) at the output of the differential amplifier Op1 equal to the high supply voltage source Vcc2 and the voltage V(CMB) on the current mode bus CMB equal to the reference voltage source Vref.
      <br/>
      So the voltage V( ALPHA ) at the output of the differential amplifier Op1 goes to near the high supply voltage source Vcc2 which causes N-type MOS transistor M11 to turn ON.
      <br/>
      However, the differential amplifier Op1, and the transmission gate X1 subcircuit has sourced all the current to the current transmitter, therefore no current remains to pass through causes N-type MOS transistor M11.
      <br/>
      Thus the voltage V( BETA ) at the output of the differential amplifier Op2 remains undisturbed at the reference voltage source Vref.
      <br/>
      This state corresponds to the fourth line of Table 4, below,  ALPHA =1,  BETA =Vref.

      In FIG. 4a, the first data bit b1RX of the two data bits received is the logical NOT of the first unextracted data bit  ALPHA  and will be implemented as a simple inverter circuit.

      The circuit to determine whether the second unextracted data bit  BETA  is at the midlevel is shown in FIG. 4b. The second terminal of the current receiver of FIG. 3 containing the second unextracted data bit  BETA  is connected to the input of the inverter buffer circuit U1.
      <br/>
      The inverting buffer circuit U1 is designed such that its output will not change state until the input has exceeded its a threshold trip point voltage.
      <br/>
      The threshold trip point voltage in this case will have a magnitude sufficiently greater than the midlevel between the first logic state (0) and the second logic state (1) such that the inverter U3 is guaranteed not to change state if the second unextracted data bit  BETA  is at the midlevel.

      Many digital communication systems have a requirement that there is communication between the functional units in both directions or bidirectionally on the same transmission medium.
      <br/>
      Refer now to FIG. 5 for a description of a multiple-bit bidirectional current mode digital communication system.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The multiple-bit bidirectional current mode communication system has transmitters CMTX1 and CMTX2 and receivers CMRX1 and CMRX2 coupled to each end of the current mode bus CMB.
      <br/>
      The transmitter CMTX1 combines the two data bits b11TX and b12TX to form the current mode signal CMS1.
      <br/>
      The current mode signal CMS1 is received by the current mode receiver CMRX2.
      <br/>
      The current mode receiver CMRX2 will extract the digital data bits b11RX and b12RX from the current mode signal CMS1.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The current mode transmitter CMTX2 will combine the two digital data bits b21TX and b22TX to form the current mode signal CMS2.
      <br/>
      The current mode signal CMS2 is received by the current mode receiver CMRX1.
      <br/>
      The current mode receiver CMRX1 will then extract the two data bits b21RX and b22RX from the current mode signal CMS2.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      In this embodiment, the current mode bus CMB must transmit data in one direction, cease transmission in the one direction and then start transmission in the opposite direction.
      <br/>
      For example if current mode transmitter CMTX1 is transmitting to current receiver CMRX2, current mode transmitter CMTX2 and current mode receiver CMRX1 must be quiescent.
      <br/>
      For current mode transmitter CMTX2 to transmit to the current mode receiver CMRX1, the current mode transmitter CMTX1 and current mode receiver CMRX2 must be brought to the quiescent state.
      <br/>
      The mode of communication is often called simplex transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The current mode transmitters of FIG. 2 will be made quiescent by placing the inputs b1TX and b2TX both to a voltage that is within an MOS threshold of the reference voltage source Vref.
      <br/>
      Since mid-level precharge is the rule in DRAM data paths and in this case no extra care would be required to reduce current drain during standby.
      <br/>
      In the bidirectional communications case, then, we would do the same by turning off the transmitter by taking its inputs to the reference voltage source Vref.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The current mode receivers of FIG. 3 would be put into standby quickly by means of an MOS transmission gate in series between the current mode bus CMB and the noninverting input (-) of the differential amplifier Op1.
      <br/>
      Since the voltage on voltage on the current mode bus CMB is always very near the level of the reference voltage source Vref, only need one type of MOS transistor in the transmission gate is needed.
      <br/>
      An NMOS transistor would be chosen for its higher gain.
      <br/>
      If both transmission gates were OFF in the bi-directional line of the current mode bus CMB of FIG. 5 would be floating.
      <br/>
      Having the current mode bus floating could cause undesirable operation and a high impedance resistor or small, ON, MOS transistor between the current mode bus CMB and the reference voltage source Vref to keep the current mode bus CMB biased near reference voltage source Vref during the OFF times.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The current mode transmitters CMTX1 and CMTX2 are as described above described in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The current mode receivers CMRX1 and CMRX2 are as above described in FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      If a bidirectional bus has one wire per direction and two bits per wire, it is possible to have absolutely simultaneous two-way transmission.
      <br/>
      No bus arbitration or turn around time whatever.
      <br/>
      This is a much better use of two wires than the conventional two single bit duplex lines, in which the buses and circuitry need frequent turning around.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the current mode transmitter as described in FIG. 2 and the current mode receiver of FIG. 3 FIG. 4a, FIG. 4b, and FIG. 4c can be expanded to incorporate more data bits than the two as described.
      <br/>
      The complexity of the circuitry expands greatly making explanation and implementation difficult.
      <br/>
      Further, it will also be apparent to those skilled in the art that the current mode transmitter of FIG. 2 and the current mode receiver as described in FIG. 3 FIG. 4a, FIG. 4b, and FIG. 4c can be implemented in other MOS transistor technologies, as well as in bipolar junction transistor technology.
