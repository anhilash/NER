      It has been discovered that the stimulation of betaadrenergic receptors, which activate cAMP formation, give rise to increased APP and GFAP synthesis in astrocytes.
      <br/>
      Hence, the in vitro or in vivo exposure of neuronal cells to certain compositions comprising beta-adrenergic receptor ligands or agonists, including, e.g., norepinephrine, isoproterenol and the like, increases APP mRNA transcription and consequent APP overproduction.
      <br/>
      These increases are blocked by beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, such as propranolol.
      <br/>
      The in vitro or in vivo treatment of these cells with 8Br-cAMP, prostaglandin E2 (PG E2), forskolin, and nicotine ditartrate also increased APP synthesis, including an increase in mRNA and holoprotein levels, as well as an increase in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).
      <br/>
      Compositions and methods are disclosed of regulating APP overexpression and mediating reactive astrogliosis through cAMP signaling or the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors.
      <br/>
      It has further been found that the increase in APP synthesis caused by 8Br-cAMP, PG E2, or forskolin is inhibited by immunosuppressants, immunophilin ligands, or anti-inflammatory agents, such as cyclosporin A, and FK-506 (tacrolimus), as well as ion-channel modulators, including ion chelating agents such as EGTA, or calcium/calmodulin kinase inhibitors, such as KN93.
      <br/>
      The present invention has broad implications in the alleviation, treatment, or prevention of neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to compositions and methods for the treatment of various neurological diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly those affected by an overabundance of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP).
      <br/>
      In particular, it has been discovered that APP synthesis is stimulated by activation of cell surface receptors coupled to the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).
      <br/>
      Moreover, it has been found that certain substances can inhibit APP synthesis, either directly or by antagonizing receptors coupled to cAMP formation.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder of aging, and is characterized by progressive dementia and personality dysfunction.
      <br/>
      The abnormal accumulation of amyloid plaques in the vicinity of degenerating neurons and reactive astrocytes is a pathological characteristic of AD.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As the fourth leading cause of death in industrialized societies, surpassed only by heart disease, stroke and cancer, AD affects 5-11% of the population over the age of 65 and 30% of those over the age of 85.
      <br/>
      The estimated cost of caring for the approximate 2.5-4.0 million AD cases in the USA exceeded $60 billion in 1991 alone.
      <br/>
      Considering the estimated 17-25 million existing AD cases worldwide, AD will no doubt become an escalating healthcare problem of unparalleled proportions as the world's geriatric population grows.
      <br/>
      Much work remains in the quest to find an effective treatment for AD.

      APP processing is regulated by neurotransmitters and synaptic activity.

      The activation of neurotransmitter receptors, which are coupled to phosphotidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis or to protein kinase C (PKC) activation, can promote APP metabolism and decrease amyloid formation.

      Activation of neurotransmitters coupled to cAMP production suppresses both constitutive and PKC/PI-stimulated APPs secretion in astroglioma cells and in primary astrocytes.

      <br/>
      Cyclic AMP and PK activators also increase A production, Marambaud et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 126, 1186 (1999).
      <br/>
      The drastic alterations in neurotransmitter levels and second messenger signalling created by neurodegeneration and synapse loss in AD may disrupt APP processing in ways that promote the accumulation of amyloidogenic or neurotoxic APP fragments.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the loss of various neurotransmitters in AD may increase cellular levels of APP holoprotein containing amyloidogenic or neurotoxic peptides due to a decrease in proper APP metabolism. B. A. Yankner et al., Science, 245, 417 (1989); M. R. Kozlowski, A. Spanoyannnis, S. P. Manly, S. A. Fidel, R. L. Neve, J. Neurosci. 12, 1679 (1992).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Increased APP production in Down's syndrome/Trisomy 21 is associated with a high incidence of AD at an early age due to the extra copy of the APP gene.
      <br/>
      Overexpression of APP in cell cultures and in transgenic mice is also associated with neurodegeneration and with age-related cognitive deficits, suggesting that overexpression of APP could contribute to the neuropathology of AD.

      Several APP isoforms, ranging in size from 695-770 amino acids, are derived by differential splicing of a primary transcript.
      <br/>
      Of the three major APP isoforms, APP695 is predominantly expressed in neurons; APP751 and APP770, which harbor an additional Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI) insert at the N-terminus, are predominantly expressed in astrocytes and appear to be increased in AD brain. T. E. Golde, S. Estes, M. Usiak, L. H. Younkin, S. G. Younkin, Neuron 4, 253 (1990); R. L. Neve, E. A. Finch, L. R. Dawes, Ibid., 1, 669 (1990); J. P. Anderson et al., EMBO J. 8, 3627 (1989); C. Nordstedt et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 8910 (1991).
      <br/>
      The decreased amounts of APP695 in postmortem AD brains may be due to neuronal loss.
      <br/>
      The increase in KPI-containing APP isoforms in AD and in regions surrounding senile plaques raises the possibility that transcriptional activation of APP synthesis in astrocytes contributes to AD neuropathology.

      McGeer, P. L. et al., in The Lancet, 335, 1037 (1990), present the results of a retrospective study that revealed an apparently low incidence of Alzheimer's Disease in rheumatoid arthritis patients.
      <br/>
      These authors propose the possibility that anti-inflammatory therapy confers some protection against AD.
      <br/>
      While provocative, the authors' proposal is based solely on circumstantial evidence.
      <br/>
      This fact is not lost on the authors, who note three alternative explanations for their observations, in addition to the possible protective role of anti-inflammatory therapy.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Andersen, K. et al., in Neurology (August 1995) 45:1441, describe the results of their retrospective study.
      <br/>
      This article, perhaps, illustrates the care that one should take in conducting studies "in hindsight" because of the danger of over-interpretation or over-manipulation of the data in an effort to enhance any perceived differences.
      <br/>
      To their credit, the authors tempered their conclusions, stating that their findings are "compatible" with a possible protecting effect of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) on the risk of AD.
      <br/>
      The authors fairly point out that important issues remain, including whether the presence of complement leads to neurodegeneration or whether the activation of complement is brought about by the cell's need to phagocytose damaged neurons, how long one has to be exposed to NSAIDs to obtain clinically detectable results, and the need for studies that are better designed.
      <br/>
      The article adds that no relationship between NSAIDs exposure and cognitive function is found.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In contrast, an earlier article by Rich, J. B. et al., which appeared in Neurology (January 1995) 45:51, reported on the results of their review of the records of 210 Alzheimer's patients.
      <br/>
      These authors concluded that patients on NSAIDs performed better on certain tests, including Mini-Mental State Examination, Boston Naming Test, delayed Benton Visual Retention Test, among others, versus non-NSAID patients.
      <br/>
      However, no significant difference is found in an even greater number of other tests performed, including Block Design, Immediate Benton Visual Retention Test, Gollin Incomplete Figures Test, to name a few.
      <br/>
      Recognizing the inherent limitations of their study, the authors state that "�m�ethodologic limitations inherent in retrospective studies such as this one preclude us from addressing the specificity of the protective effects of NSAIDs." Indeed, the patients examined are likely to be on several types of medication at once.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In fact, in an earlier study by Lindsay, J. and co-workers reported in Neurology (November 1994) 44:2073, it is found that those with arthritis had a significantly reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease.
      <br/>
      It is also found that the use of NSAIDs gave rise statistically to a lower risk.
      <br/>
      However, it is suggested that the presence of arthritis itself is the determinant in lowering the apparent risk for developing Alzheimer's disease and not the taking of NSAIDs.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      One has to go back even earlier to a study by Rogers, J. et al., in Neurology (August 1993) 43:1609, to find a controlled 6-month investigation involving the administration of 100-150 mg indomethacin (an NSAID) or placebo to mild or moderately impaired Alzheimer's disease patients.
      <br/>
      These authors report that, based on a battery of cognitive tests, the indomethacin treatment appeared to protect those patients receiving indomethacin from the degree of cognitive decline exhibited by patients receiving placebo.
      <br/>
      If anything, this article, or any that have followed this article, suggests that the administration of indomethacin reduces the onset of dementia in Alzheimer's patients.
      <br/>
      Never has it been disclosed or suggested that the administration of indomethacin prevents the overproduction of APP.

      <br/>
      GFAP levels are elevated in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid in AD �Wallin et al., Dementia, 7, 267 (1996)�, suggesting that reactive astrocytes may contribute to the neuropathology.

      In the AD brain, the loss of synapses is associated with an increase in the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes �Brun et al., Neurodegeneration, 4, 171 (1995)�, and increases in KPI-containing APP mRNA in the frontal cortex have also been attributed to the astrocytic response during neuronal damage �Golde et al., Neuron, 4, 253 (1990)�. It seems that the loss of synapses and neurons in AD might initiate a pathological cascade that includes APP synthesis by reactive astrocytes.

      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,915, Buxbaum et al. describe methods and compositions for affecting APP processing by the administration of agents that regulate protein phosphorylation, namely agents that regulate kinases or phosphatases.
      <br/>
      The modulation of APP processing leads, in turn, to the regulation of the production of  BETA /A4 peptide, a peptide that accumulates in amyloidogenic plaques.

      See, e.g., col. 6, lines 8-10.
      <br/>
      Hence, Buxbaum et al. teach that one's objective should focus on the search for agents that alter the metabolism of APP.
      <br/>
      They make no mention, teaching, or suggestion that the step preceding the processing of APP, that is, the expression, production, or formation of APP, itself, can be at all affected by select groups of substances.
      <br/>
      Indeed, as Buxbaum et al. state (at col. 21, lines 7-9), "the effects observed are attributable to changes in APP metabolism rather than APP transcription" (emphasis added).
      <br/>
      Consistent with this notion, the claims of Buxbaum et al. are drawn to a method of regulating phosphorylation of proteins that control the processing of APP.

    <p num="28">
      It has now been discovered that prolonged activation of receptors that are coupled to increased cAMP formation in cortical astrocytes upregulates both APP mRNA levels and APP holoprotein bearing the KPI insert.
      <br/>
      It has further been discovered that such overproduction, which it is shown can result from the body's response to brain injury or trauma, can be inhibited by certain substances, including agents that inhibit an inflammatory response and immune system suppressants or immunophilin ligands.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In particular, it has been discovered that the immune or inflammatory response of astrocytes to brain injury accelerates the formation of amyloid plaques.
      <br/>
      It has also been shown that cAMP signaling regulates the astrocytic response to neuronal injury, while also stimulating transcriptional activation of the APP gene.
      <br/>
      Further, it is shown that prostaglandins, which are coupled to cAMP, also stimulate APP overexpression.

      What is more, it has been shown that certain substances, including immune system suppressants (agents that inhibit an inflammatory response, and the like) or immunophilin ligands inhibit this abnormal increase in APP synthesis (mRNA and cell-associated protein), which is caused by elevations in cAMP levels.
      <br/>
      Thus, these substances can be used to prevent APP over-expression in brain cells.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      It has further been discovered that ion-gated channels can regulate APP overexpression.
      <br/>
      This is based on the observations, discussed herein, that the activation of nicotinic receptors in cultured astrocytes increases cellular levels of APP, as well as the observation that ion-channel modulators, such as calcium channel blockers and calcium/calmodulin kinase inhibitors, partially inhibit the stimulatory effect of prostaglandins on APP synthesis.
    </p>
    <p num="32">It has further been discovered that non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDS), such as inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase activity including, but not limited to, aspirin also prevent APP overexpression and the overproduction of amyloidogenic peptides.</p>
    <p num="33">It has still further been discovered that non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDS), such as specific inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase type 2 activity including, but not limited to, DFU (5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulfonyl)phenyl-2(5H)-furanone), DFP (5,5-dimethyl-3-isopropyloxy-4-(4'-methylsulfonylphenyl)-2(5H)-furanone), and resveratrol, can also prevent APP overexpression and the overproduction of amyloidogenic peptides.</p>
    <p num="34">Furthermore, it has been discovered that NSAID cyclo-oxygenase type 2 inhibitors also increase secretion of soluble APP, and reduce intracellular APP holoprotein.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The present invention also contemplates and provides an assay for identifying or screening potential drugs that can inhibit the excessive or inappropriate production of amyloidogenic or neurotoxic APP fragments.
      <br/>
      For example, such an assay may utilize a tissue or cell culture comprising brain cells, as described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The invention also contemplates a method by which the overexpression of APP is deliberately effected, followed by the promotion or stimulation of APP metabolism to provide soluble APP (APPs).
      <br/>
      The former step can be attained by, for example, cAMP signaling, while the latter process can be accomplished, for example, by the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or of neurotransmitter agonists (e.g., via m1, m3, serotoninergic, or metabotropic glutamate receptors) which increase phophotidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      Consequently, increased amounts of APPs are secreted into the medium, and the formation of amyloidogenic A BETA  peptides is disrupted.
      <br/>
      It is believed that secreted APPs have neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions.
      <br/>
      Secreted APPs have been shown to promote neurite outgrowth and maintain synapse.
      <br/>
      It is believed further that increased APPs secretion promotes synaptic transmission and neuronal regeneration (e.g., via neurite or axonal outgrowth).
      <br/>
      The net result is the conversion of an amyloidogenic event (i.e., APP overexpression and A BETA  formation) into a neurotrophic event (i.e., APPs secretion).
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The invention further contemplates that decreasing overexpression of amyloidogenic APP and amyloidogenic APP peptides is beneficial in treatment of subjects with neurodegenerative conditions, including immune or inflammatory conditions associated with Alzheimers Disease, stroke, cerebral ischemia, de-myelinating conditions, and mechanical injury.
      <br/>
      Decreasing overexpression of amyloidogenic APP and amyloidogenic APP peptides is also contemplated in the present invention as beneficial in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers Disease.

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="40">
      Cultures of cortical astrocytes can be obtained from postnatal rats.
      <br/>
      See, e.g., K. D. McCarthy and J. de Vellis, J. Cell Biol. 85, 890 (1980).
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The inventors have shown that the activation of adrenergic receptors present in the cortical astrocytes by 50  MU M norepinephrine (NE) for a period of about 24 h increases the amount of cell-associated APP holoprotein by .about.1.7-fold relative to amounts in untreated cells (See, FIG. 1, A), as measured using Western blots.
      <br/>
      The stimulatory effect of NE on total APP protein is inhibited by the  BETA -adrenergic antagonist propranolol (50  MU M) which, on its own, has no significant effect on basal APP protein levels.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      On Northern blots, APP mRNA levels are about 1.7-fold and about 1.6-fold higher after 24 h treatment with NE (50 or 100  MU M) or the  BETA -adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (50  MU M), respectively, than those in untreated cells (FIG. 1, B); these increases are also abolished by 50  MU M propranolol (FIG. 1, C).
      <br/>
      However, astrocytic levels of APP mRNA or of holoprotein do not increase linearly with increasing NE concentrations (50-400  MU M).
      <br/>
      NE can stimulate cAMP formation and PI hydrolysis by activating  BETA - or  ALPHA 2 -adrenergic receptors, respectively.
      <br/>
      Propranolol (50  MU M) inhibits the NE-induced (50  MU M) increase in cAMP formation but not the increase in PI hydrolysis (FIG. 2), suggesting that activation of  BETA -adrenergic receptors stimulates APP gene expression in cultured cortical astrocytes by enhancing cAMP synthesis.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Increases in  BETA -adrenergic receptor density in the hippocampus and cortex of AD brain have been attributed by others to the proliferation of astrocytes.
      <br/>
      See, N. Kalaria et al., J. Neurochem. 53, 1772 (1989).
      <br/>
      Aberrant activation of these receptors, perhaps by circulating NE in AD or through a damaged blood-brain barrier, may cause abnormal cAMP signaling and, thus, APP overexpression in astrocytes.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In various cell lines, exposure to phorbol ester or to interleukin-1 can increase APP mRNA production by activating PKC and the AP-1 binding site on the APP promoter.
      <br/>
      See, D. Goldgaber et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 86, 7606 (1989).
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Since NE also increased PI hydrolysis, the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate generated by PI hydrolysis could also have promoted APP expression in cortical astrocytes by activating PKC.
      <br/>
      However, direct activation of PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (5  MU M) or activation of serotoninergic receptors by dexnorfenfluramine (100  MU M), which also stimulates PI hydrolysis by .about.2.6-fold relative to untreated astrocytes (p&lt;0.05), does not increase APP mRNA or holoprotein levels but does increase APPs secretion by .about.3.0- and .about.2.2-fold, respectively, to that of untreated cells (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      These results indicate that activation of PKC or of receptors coupled to PI hydrolysis does not stimulate APP synthesis in astrocytes but does promote APP metabolism.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      To confirm that increased APP synthesis is mediated by elevations in cAMP levels caused by  BETA -adrenergic receptor stimulation, the inventors have exposed astrocytes to the membrane-permeant 8-Bromo-cAMP (8Br-cAMP) or to the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin.
      <br/>
      The levels of APP holoprotein in astrocytes increases linearly with increasing concentrations of 8Br-cAMP or forskolin after 24 h treatment (FIG. 4) as revealed by the use of known monoclonal antibodies (mAb22C11) or antiserum (R37) directed against the N- or C-terminus of APP, respectively.
      <br/>
      The inventors have also shown from the use of the known antiserum R98, which recognizes an epitope of the KPI domain, that KPI-containing APP isoforms in cortical astrocytes are also increased by treatments that elevate cAMP levels.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      APPs levels in astrocytes that are treated with or without 8Br-cAMP (250  MU M) for 24 h do not differ significantly (p&gt;0.05), suggesting that decreases in APP metabolism do not account for the increase in astrocytic APP protein that is observed with 8Br-cAMP treatment FIGS. 5A and 5B. Northern blot analyses show that treatment with 250  MU M 8Br-cAMP for 24 h increases astrocytic APP mRNA levels to .about.1.8-fold those of untreated cells (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      This result indicates that prolonged (.about.24 h) cAMP signaling in cultured astrocytes can stimulate APP synthesis by transcriptional activation.
      <br/>
      Although exposure to 50 or 100  MU M 8Br-cAMP occasionally increases APP mRNA, these effects are not consistent.
      <br/>
      No significant changes in APP mRNA levels are detected after 6 h or 12 h treatment with 8Br-cAMP (250  MU M).
      <br/>
      The inventors have also observed that the APP transcript in astrocytes treated with or without 8Br-cAMP has a slower mobility than that observed in neurons.
      <br/>
      Hence, the APP mRNA that is upregulated by 8Br-cAMP treatment may contain the KPI motif.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The increases in APP mRNA that is caused by 8Br-cAMP (250  MU M) or NE (50  MU M) are associated with decreases in levels of mRNA for  BETA -actin (FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      The downregulation of cytoskeletal stress fibres, such as actin, may be related to the morphological differentiation of astrocytes from flat, polygonal cells to process-bearing, stellate cells.
      <br/>
      Moreover, GFAP expression in cultured astrocytes is also increased by elevations in cAMP levels (FIG. 4; FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      These morphological and biochemical changes that are induced by 8Br-cAMP in cultured astrocytes resemble the gliotic response of astrocytes in vivo.
      <br/>
      These findings thus suggest that the increased APP immunoreactivity in astrocytes after neuronal injury results from increased APP gene expression rather than from the internalization of exogenous APP that are released from dying cells.
      <br/>
      It is noted that Gegelashvili et al. reported that treatment with dibutyryl cAMP in serum-containing medium increased APP mRNA in rat glioma cells but not in cortical astrocytes.
      <br/>
      See, G. Gegelashvili, E. Bock, A. Schousboe, D. Linnemann. Mol. Brain. Res. 37, 151 (1996).
      <br/>
      Apparently, the stimulatory effect of cAMP on APP synthesis in cortical astrocytes of the present invention is related to the use of serum-deprived cells.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Induction of gene transcription by cAMP can be inhibited by the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A. In cortical astrocytes, cyclosporin A (1, 5, or 10  MU M) inhibits the increase in APP mRNA and APP holoprotein which is caused by 24 h exposure to 8Br-cAMP (250  MU M).
      <br/>
      The inhibitory effects of 1, 5, or 10  MU M cyclosporin A do not differ significantly (FIG. 9).
      <br/>
      Basal APP holoprotein levels, APPs secretion and GFAP expression also are unaffected by these concentrations of cyclosporin A (p&gt;0.05).
      <br/>
      Hence, immunosuppressants such as cyclosporin A exhibit a potential usefulness for preventing aberrant APP expression in AD.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The results reported herein further show that activation of PG E2 receptors coupled to cAMP formation stimulates APP gene expression in cultured cortical astrocytes.
      <br/>
      Increases in APP mRNA and holoprotein were detected with 1, 10 or 100  MU M PG E2 treatment of astrocytes for 24 h. Shorter duration treatment (6 or 12 h) with 10  MU M PG E2 did not reliably increase APP synthesis (unpublished data).
      <br/>
      Because about 95% of the cells in our cultures express proteins specific for astrocytes but not for neurons or microglia �Lee and Wurtman, J. Neurochem., 68, 1830 (1997)�, we suggest the increased APP mRNA and holoprotein observed after PG E2 treatments originates from astrocytes.
      <br/>
      Since APP overexpression causes symptoms of AD �Cordell, Annu.
      <br/>
      Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 34, 69 (1994); Yoshikawa et al., Nature, 359, 64 (1992); Hsiao et al., Neuron, 15, 1203 (1995)�, it seems that increased APP synthesis in astrocytes stimulated by PG E2 may accelerate neuropathology, and the formation of amyloidogenic and neurotoxic peptides.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Alternative splicing of the APP gene yields several APP isoforms of vary sizes.
      <br/>
      Kang et al., Nature, 325, 733 (1987); Oltersdorf et al., Nature, 341, 144 (1989); van Nostrand et al., Nature, 341, 546 (1989).
      <br/>
      APP695 which lacks the KPI-motif is the major isoforms found in the brain.
      <br/>
      Astrocytes and microglia , both of which express APP751/770 isoforms containing the KPI domain, express only low levels of APP mRNA and protein in the resting state but upregulate KPI-containing APP isoforms following brain injury or neurodegeneration.
      <br/>
      Siman et al., J. Neurosci., 3, 275 (1989); Sola et al., Mol. Brain Res., 17, 41 (1993); Banati et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab., 12, 257 (1995).
      <br/>
      Our labelled APP cDNA probe did not distinguish between the various kinds of APP transcripts on Northern blots.
      <br/>
      However, Western blot analyses using antiserum R98 �Kametani et al., Biochem. Biomed. Res. Comm., 191, 392 (1993)� revealed increases in KPI-containing APP isoforms following PG E2 treatments.
      <br/>
      Increases in cellular APP holoprotein were also detected by antisera R37 directed at the C-terminus of APP, indicating that the KPI-containing APP increased by astrocytes are full-length holoproteins harboring intact and potentially amyloidogenic A BETA  peptides.
      <br/>
      Since mAb22C11 recognizes the N-termini of both APP and APP-like proteins �Weidemann et al., Cell, 57, 115 (1989); Slunt et al., J. Biol.Chem., 269, 2637 (1994)�, it is possible that PG E2 treatment may also stimulate transcriptional regulation of other members of the APP gene family.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      APP synthesis in astrocytes is probably mediated by the increases in cAMP production stimulated by PG E2 treatment.
      <br/>
      Concentration-dependent elevations in cAMP were observed after treatment with 1, 10 or 100  MU M PG E2 but not with 0.1  MU M PG E2.
      <br/>
      Similarly, 1, 10 or 100 but not 0.1  MU M PG E2 stimulated increases in APP mRNA and holoprotein.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of PG E2 on APP synthesis was also mimicked by membrane-permeant 8Br-cAMP (250  MU M) or by activating adenylate cyclase with forskolin (10, 50 or 100  MU M).
      <br/>
      Elevations in cAMP activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) which, in turn, phosphorylates proteins involved in regulating gene expression.
      <br/>
      In our study, activation of PKA by Sp-cAMP triethylamine in the absence of PG E2 was sufficient to stimulate increases in astrocytic APP holoprotein.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, inhibition of protein kinase A by H-89 dihydrochloride blocked the stimulatory effect of PG E2 on APP mRNA production.
      <br/>
      These data provide strong support for PKA in mediating the stimulatory effect of cAMP on APP synthesis.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The APP promoter contains several sequences for regulatory elements that are responsive to cAMP signalling.
      <br/>
      Salbaum et al., EMBO J., 7, 2807 (1988).
      <br/>
      PKA can phosphorylate cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) to stimulate gene expression.
      <br/>
      While there is no canonical sequence for CREB (TGACGTCA) within the 3.7-kb region upstream of the APP transcription start site �Salbaum et al., ibid�, a consensus sequence for CREB (TGACCTCA) could be responsible for initiating APP synthesis in astrocytes.
      <br/>
      Elevations in cAMP may also induce c-fos and c-jun expression to activate APP synthesis through AP-1 recognition sites.
      <br/>
      However, APP synthesis in NG108-15 and HepG2 cells stimulated by dibutyryl cAMP appears not to depend on the presence of AP-1 or AP-2 sites.
      <br/>
      Bourbonniere et al., J. Neurochem., 68, 909 (1997); Shekarabi et al., J. Neurochem., 68, 970 (1997).
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, at least two other cAMP-responsive regions have been identified within the APP promoter of NG-108 cells �Bourbonniere et al., ibid�. It is not known if these cis-acting regulators are functional for regulating cAMP responsiveness in astrocytes, or if the induction of APP synthesis is mediated by trans-acting elements acting through the expression of other cAMP-responsive genes.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK-506, which are also immunophilin ligands, are inhibitors of calcineurin and can suppress gene activation stimulated by cAMP.
      <br/>
      Schwaninger et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270, 8860 (1995).
      <br/>
      We previously found that cyclosporin A inhibited APP synthesis in astrocytes treated with 8-Bromo-cAMP but we did not determine if cyclosporin A would inhibit APP synthesis stimulated by first messengers.
      <br/>
      Lee et al., PNAS USA, 94, 5422 (1997).
      <br/>
      We now show that cyclosporin A or FK-506 completely abolished APP overexpression stimulated by PG E2 or by forskolin.
      <br/>
      Both cyclosporin A and FK-506 bind to intracellular immunophilin receptors that are not known to directly affect cAMP production.
      <br/>
      Clardy, PNAS USA, 92, 56 (1995).
      <br/>
      As expected, neither cyclosporin A nor FK-506 had any effect on basal cAMP levels in cultured astrocytes, and neither drug inhibited the increase in cAMP caused by PG E2.
      <br/>
      Hence, the inhibitory effect of cyclosporin A or FK-506 appears to lie downstream of cAMP production and possibly by interfering directly with gene transcription.
      <br/>
      Although cyclosporin A and FK-506 are potent immunosuppressive drugs generally used to prevent rejection of organ transplants and autoimmune diseases, our data suggest that both these immunosuppressants may be useful for preventing aberrant APP overexpression.

      AD is not usually considered to be an inflammatory or immune disease.
      <br/>
      However, increased lipid peroxidation and formation of prostaglandins have been reported in AD.
      <br/>
      Iwamoto et al., J. Neurol., 236, 80 (1989); Subbarao et al., J. Neurochem., 55, 342 (1990).
      <br/>
      In addition, all major components of the classical complement pathway appear to be associated with AD lesions, suggesting that neuronal damage or amyloid deposits may trigger inflammatory or immune processes and accelerate neuropathology.
      <br/>
      McGeer and McGeer, Brain Res.
      <br/>
      Rev., 21, 195 (1995).
      <br/>
      Epidemiological data provide strong circumstantial evidence that anti-inflammatory therapies such as the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or dapsone may be effective in slowing the progression of neuropathology in AD.
      <br/>
      McGeer and McGeer, ibid.
      <br/>
      The results presented herein suggest that antiinflammatory agents such as indomethacin or inhibitors of prostaglandin G/H synthase (cyclooxygenase), such as DFU (5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulfonyl)phenyl-2(5H)-furanone), DFP (5,5-dimethyl-3-isopropyloxy-4-(4'-methylsulfonylphenyl)-2(5H)-furanone), and resveratrol, which prevent the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid can prevent the production of amyloid and neurotoxic APP fragments associated with APP overexpression in astrocytes.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Aspirin, like most NSAIDs, inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.
      <br/>
      Cultured astrocytes or neurons are treated with aspirin or resveratrol for 1 h (at nano- or micromolar range), resulting in an increase in the secretion of soluble APPs (as measured by Western blot analysis).
      <br/>
      The increase in APPs secretion caused by aspirin or resveratrol is accompanied by a decreased levels of cellular and amyloidogenic APP holoprotein (FIG. 16).
      <br/>
      Thus, NSAIDs stimulate non-amyloidogenic APP processing in vitro.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Most traditional NSAIDs are more potent against COX-1 than COX-2.
      <br/>
      Since COX-2 inhibitors can offer comparable efficacy without the risks of undesirable side-effects associated with non-specific COX inhibitors, the effect of specific COX-2 inhibitors on APPs secretion and on the levels of APP holoprotein is examined.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Highly selective COX-2 inhibitors such as DFU (5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl)phenyl-2(5H)-furanone) and DFP (5,5-dimethyl-3-isopropyloxy-4-(4'-methylsulfonylphenyl)-2(5H)-furanone) are orally bioactive drugs that prevent the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins.
      <br/>
      Treatment of cultured astrocytes with DFU or DFP (10-9 -10-3 M) for 1 h increases the secretion of soluble APPs and concurrently decreases the levels of cellular APP holoprotein (FIG. 17).
      <br/>
      These data indicate that specific COX-2 inhibitors can prevent the excessive accumulation of amyloidogenic APP, and also prevent the formation of amyloid by enhancing the conversion of APP to form soluble APPs.

    <p num="136">In Vivo Studies</p>
    <p num="137">
      The present studies indicate that immune system suppressants, such as cyclosporin A, can inhibit APP overexpression in GFAP-immunoreactive cultured astrocytes.
      <br/>
      Reactive astrocytes (that is, astrocytes that have been activated or stimulated in some fashion, e.g., those associated with brain or neuronal injury) in vivo also upregulate GFAP expression.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the examination of post-mortem brains in patients with Alzheimer's disease shows that reactive astrocytes are found in proximity to amyloid plaques and regions of neurodegeneration.
      <br/>
      The inventors believe that neuronal, brain, or head injury gives rise to the formation of reactive astrocytes, which overexpress APP and contribute to the formation of amyloid or neurotoxic APP derivatives.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      Thus, animal models of head injury and Alzheimer's disease exhibit increased amounts of APP in the brain.
      <br/>
      The in vivo administration of immune system suppressants, like cyclosporin A, is found to inhibit APP overexpression and the associated neurological disorders.
      <br/>
      Inasmuch as head injury is associated with Alzheimer's disease (e.g., boxers with dementia pugilista), treatment with immunosuppressants may prevent the progression of neuropathological symptoms associated with this disease.
      <br/>
      Likewise, it is found that the in vivo administration of agents that reduce or prevent astrocytic inflammation (e.g., reactive astrogliosis) reduces GFAP immunoreactivity and APP overexpression.
    </p>
    <p num="139">Results</p>
    <p num="140">
      In summary, confluent primary rat cortical astrocytes, which are treated with serum-free medium containing 50, 100, or 250  MU M, respectively, of 8-Bromo-cAMP (8Br-cAMP) for 24 h, show a dose-dependent increase in APP mRNA on Northern blots (120%, 150% and 180% of untreated cells).
      <br/>
      In comparison,  BETA -actin MRNA is decreased to 50% of untreated cells by 8Br-cAMP (250  MU M).
      <br/>
      Both L-norepinephrine (NE, 50 or 100  MU M) and the  BETA -adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (50  MU M) increase APP MRNA to 180% of untreated cells.
      <br/>
      The  BETA -adrenergic antagonist propranolol (50  MU M) reduces the NE-stimulated increase in APP mRNA to baseline levels. N- and C-terminal APP antibodies 22C11 and R37 (from Dr. F. Kametani, Tokyo Inst.
      <br/>
      Psychiatry), respectively, show that 8Br-cAMP or NE also increases APP holoprotein in cell lysates to 200% of that seen in untreated cells.
      <br/>
      Both drugs also increase process formation and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in astrocytes.
      <br/>
      Thus, activation of  BETA -adrenergic receptors coupled to cAMP formation increases both APP mRNA and holoprotein in reactive astrocytes.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      The APP gene promoter contains a consensus sequence for a cAMP response element (CRE).
      <br/>
      The immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CycA, 10  MU M), which is known to inhibit CRE-mediated transcription, blocks the increase in APP protein caused by 8Br-cAMP.
      <br/>
      This result suggests that CycA may be used to prevent increases in APP and, potentially, amyloid formation in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.

      Cultured astrocytes or neurons are treated with aspirin or resveratrol for 1 h (at nano- or micromolar range), and secretion of soluble APPs is measured by Western blot analysis.
      <br/>
      The increase in APPs secretion caused by aspirin or resveratrol is accompanied by decreased levels of cellular and amyloidogenic APP holoprotein (FIG. 16).
      <br/>
      Thus, NSAIDs appear to stimulate non-amyloidogenic APP processing in vitro.

    <p num="167">Effect of DFU or DFP on APP expression and secretion in primary cultured brain cells.</p>
    <p num="168">
      Treatment of cultured astroyctes with DFU (A) or of cultured neurons with DFP (B) promotes APPs secretion and decreases the levels of amyloidogenic APP holoprotein in cultured.
      <br/>
      Since COX-2 inhibitors may offer comparable efficacy without the risks of undesirable side-effects associated with non-specific COX inhibitors, we examine the effect of specific COX-2 inhibitors on APPs secretion and on the levels of APP holoprotein.
      <br/>
      FIG. 17 shows that treatment of cultured astrocytes with DFU or DFP (10-9 -10-3 M) for 1 h increases the secretion of soluble APPs and concurrently decreases the levels of cellular APP holoprotein.
      <br/>
      These data indicate that specific COX-2 inhibitors can prevent the excessive accumulation of amyloidogenic APP, and also prevent the formation of amyloid by enhancing the conversion of APP to form soluble APPs.

      <br/>
      We injected rats with para-chloroamphetamine (PCA), a neurotoxin which causes a loss of serotoninergic terminals in the brain.
      <br/>
      We confirmed by microdialysis that serotonin release in the striatum was compromised following chronic treatment with PCA, suggesting that serotoninergic terminals or synapses may be destroyed in rats injected with PCA.
    </p>
    <p num="171">
      Examination of brain tissue from the striatum or hippocampus revealed that the levels of APP holoprotein, as well as KPI-containing APP isoforms, were increased by PCA injections (FIG. 18).
      <br/>
      In rats injected with both aspirin and PCA, the levels of APP holoprotein did not differ from the levels of uninjected, control rats.
      <br/>
      Interestingly, injections of aspirin alone caused a significant decrease in the levels of amyloidogenic APP holoprotein relative to control levels, an effect that is consistent with our in vitro studies with cultures astrocytes or neurons.
      <br/>
      These data suggest that NSAIDs may be useful in preventing APP overexpression in an in vivo model of AD.

    <p num="172">Conclusion</p>
    <p num="173">
      Accordingly, the invention provides compositions and methods for preventing, alleviating, or inhibiting abnormal APP synthesis by the administration of antagonists (e.g., propranolol) of receptors that are coupled to cAMP formation, particularly where the upregulation of such receptors and APP overexpression accompanies brain trauma, neurological disease, or neurodegenerative disorder.
      <br/>
      The administration of such receptor antagonists suppresses cAMP formation, which in turn inhibits abnormal APP synthesis.
    </p>
    <p num="174">
      Hence, the invention provides relief from the neuropathological symptoms of diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, by inhibiting aberrant APP gene expression.
      <br/>
      It is the overexpression of the APP gene that is believed to cause or strongly contribute to neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction in animals and humans.
    </p>
    <p num="175">It should be apparent to those of ordinary skill that the discussion presented herein adequately supports the hypothesis that APP synthesis (as evidenced by increases in mRNA and holoprotein) can be increased by receptors coupled to a different messenger, cAMP formation.</p>
    <p num="176">
      It should also be apparent that other embodiments of the invention can be readily contemplated by those of ordinary skill in the art after reviewing the present specification and teachings.
