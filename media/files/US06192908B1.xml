    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates generally to improvements in portable seating devices and, more particularly, to an improvement in a combined seat and cane.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      In the related art, combined canes and seats are well known.
      <br/>
      Disabled people forced to use canes to aid in walking are faced with obstacles on a daily basis that most of us take for granted.
      <br/>
      Simple travel from place to place becomes a major undertaking that requires considerable effort.
      <br/>
      Fortunately, the public is becoming increasingly aware of the difficulties that these people face and are responding in a positive manner.
      <br/>
      For example, legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act imposes responsibilities upon the public sector to make provisions to accommodate the physically disabled so that they may gain access to, and take advantage of, the various goods and services available to others.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, however, there are many aspects in which our society has failed to respond thus far in addressing this issue.
      <br/>
      Access for the disabled doesn't just mean being able to get inside the door, it means being able to do so with a relative amount of comfort.
      <br/>
      A prime example of this situation is that many times waiting in lines is involved.
      <br/>
      These lines can be found in grocery stores, banks, license bureaus, and the like where there are no seating areas provided in lines.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the wait may be from a few minutes to thirty minutes or more, which is extremely uncomfortable, if not impossible, for many disabled people.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there is a need for a means by which disabled people can have access to seating areas while waiting in lines with greater ease and efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Prior art combined canes and seats attempt to fulfill this need by providing a collapsible seat connected to the main shaft body of the cane via a collapsible attachment means.
      <br/>
      To use, one simply folds the seat down into the horizontal position and seats themselves thereon.
      <br/>
      The bottom tip of cane rests on the ground and the user supports their weight thereon in this fashion.
      <br/>
      Examples of these type of cane and seat combinations are U.S. Pat. No. 4,684,090 issued to Skarland, and U.S. Pat. No. 731,291 issued to Dulin.
      <br/>
      However, the drawback of to these inventions is that one must constantly balance themselves on the seat as the entire weight of the user is transmitted to the ground solely through the tip of the cane.
      <br/>
      Another type of cane and seat combination, found in U.S. Pat. No. D 284,429 issued to Garde, appears to try to eliminate this problem by providing a collapsible seat and cane combination with a folding tubular structure that has a pair of legs for supporting the device when in the open position.
      <br/>
      However, such an arrangement proves to be bulky when carrying and doesn't look like a conventional cane.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention eliminates this problem by providing a conventional cane with a collapsible leg and seat assembly that allows a disabled individual to quickly deploy when stationary such as waiting in a line.
      <br/>
      At the base of the cane there are a plurality of legs that fold out and lock in a tripod-based arrangement similar to that found on a music stand.
      <br/>
      The seat assembly is a plurality of four retracting rods connected together via a pair of cross-members that stow conveniently inside the hollow stem of the cane.
      <br/>
      A fabric seat covering also unfolds from within the hollow cane stem wherein said fabric covering is connected along two edges to said cross-members and suspended therebetween in a semi-taut manner.
      <br/>
      When collapsed the Cane Seat forms a thin, streamlined, and lightweight arrangement that functions as a cane in a conventional manner.
      <br/>
      As a result of using the Cane Seat, the individual may move around with relative ease, and always be guaranteed access to a seat whenever they find themselves waiting in a line.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading>
    <p num="23">
      Referring now to FIG. 1, a front view of a Cane Seat 10 is shown in the fully closed configuration.
      <br/>
      In such a configuration, the Cane Seat 10 is an invaluable aid for those who have difficulties walking.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring now to FIG. 2, a front view of a Cane Seat 10 is shown in the fully open configuration.
      <br/>
      In such a configuration, the Cane Seat 10 is an invaluable aid for those who may tire while walking and desire a temporary place to sit.
      <br/>
      The Cane Seat is comprised of a shaft 40 consisting of a hollow cylinder having an elongated longitudinal axis.
      <br/>
      Shaft 40 can be made out of any material that is lightweight, stiff and capable of being formed as heretofore described.
      <br/>
      Shaft 40 is approximately one inch in diameter and three feet in length along its elongated longitudinal axis.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that these dimensions are given only as suggestions and in no way should be construed to imply any limitation.
      <br/>
      Shaft 40 is divided into two equal sections at manufacture to allow a telescopic mid-section assembly 41 to be inserted into the hollow cavity on adjoining ends of the two shaft sections.
      <br/>
      It is envisioned that a simple spring loaded mechanism would allow one to unlock the telescopic mid-section assembly to allow the user to extend and retract the length of the Cane Seat 10 as desired.
      <br/>
      Shaft 40 has a top end and a bottom end.
      <br/>
      Located on the top of shaft 40 is a pivoting handle 20 attached via a hinge 21.
      <br/>
      Located just beneath pivoting handle 20 inside the hollow cavity of shaft 40 is a retractable seat assembly 42 shown in a retracted position within the top end of the shaft 40 described further hereinbelow.
      <br/>
      On the bottom end of shaft 40 is a base assembly 44 comprising a plurality of legs 50 for supporting the Cane Seat 10 in a vertical orientation on a horizontal surface.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Referring now to FIG. 3, shown is an exploded view of a Cane Seat 10 according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention showing the detail of a plurality of four articulating seat rods 22 extending radially from a spline 26b formed on upper shaft 26 which is slidably inserted into the hollow cavitie 26a at the top end of shaft 40.
      <br/>
      Also shown is the detail of the insertion of lower shaft 51 into a hollow cavity 51a at the bottom end of shaft 40 and articulating legs 50 attached thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring now to FIGS. 4a, 4b and 4c, shown in detail is upper shaft 26 constructed from a strong, lightweight metal and having an upper end, a lower end, an elongated longitudinal axis, and generally cylindrical in shape.
      <br/>
      Upper shaft 26 is fluted on two sides so that a spline section 26b with a linearly elongated rectangular cross section is formed along the elongated longitudinal axis of upper shaft 26.
      <br/>
      This spline section 26b of upper shaft 26 extends from the upper end of upper shaft 26 for a length just slightly longer than the length of articulating seat rods 22.
      <br/>
      The purpose of this will become clearer further in this description.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Referring now to FIGS. 5a 5b and 6, the plurality of four articulating seat rods 22 are pivotally attached at the upper end of upper shaft 26 via a pair of flared pins 23 interference fitted in a pair of apertures 23a formed near the top of the spline section 26b of said upper shaft 26.
      <br/>
      Pins 23 may be 1/4 roll pins or equivalent or be replaced entirely by bolts.
      <br/>
      Two of the plurality of four seat rods 22 are attached on one side of upper shaft 26 on a flat surface of the spline section 26b.
      <br/>
      The remaining two of the plurality of four seat rods 22 are located on the opposite side of the spline section 26b of upper shaft 26.
      <br/>
      Seat rods 22 are free to pivot about flared pins 23 so that when it is desired to place the seat rods 22 in the retracted configuration the seat rods 22 are free to pivot and be aligned parallel to the flat surface of the spline section 26b.
      <br/>
      Upper shaft 26 is then slidably fitted in the interior cavity 26a near the upper end of shaft 40.
      <br/>
      Located just beneath the flared pin 23/seat rod 22 joint is upper seat collar 27 permanently fitted around an external peripheral wall of upper shaft 26.
      <br/>
      The purpose of upper seat collar 27 is to align upper shaft 26 inside the hollow cavity 26a of shaft 40 as upper shaft 26 translates back and forth from the deployed and retracted configurations.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a lower seat collar 28 (shown in FIG. 2) is located at the lower end of upper shaft 26.
      <br/>
      This serves to keep upper shaft 26 aligned as upper shaft 26 slidably translates in an up and down fashion inside shaft 40 between said retracted and deployed configurations.
      <br/>
      A stop 29 (shown in FIG. 2) fitted on the interior cavity of said shaft 40 is provided to limit the distance upper shaft 26 can travel in the vertical direction and to prevent upper shaft 26 from completely exiting from the interior cavity of shaft 40.
      <br/>
      A spring loaded push bottom 35 locking mechanism is utilized to secure the seat rod 22/upper shaft 26 assembly in the stowed configuration within shaft 40.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      A plurality of channels 25 cut into a sidewall of shaft 40 on its uppermost edge are provided to receive said seat rods 22 when in the fully deployed configuration.
      <br/>
      The channels 25 are spaced radially around the circumference of shaft 40 such that there is a forty-five degree separation between seat rods 22 that are on the same side of spline section 26b.
      <br/>
      Located on the sidewall on the upper end of shaft 40 and positioned radially between seat rods 22 on opposing sides of spline section 26b is a hinge 21 for hingedly attaching the pivoting handle 20.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Attached pivotally at the other end of one of the seat rods 22 in each of said pairs are seat rod cross members 24.
      <br/>
      Again, each seat rod cross member 24 is pivotally attached at one end via flared pin 24a interference fitted in an aperture 22a in said seat rod 22 and loosely fitted to allow one to manipulate seat rod said cross member 24 in such a fashion to attach an opposite thereof end to the opposite seat rod 22 on the same side of spline section 26b.
      <br/>
      The attachment can be one of several means but a retaining clip 22c utilizing a semi-interference fit arrangement is suggested.
      <br/>
      The exact same configuration with the two remaining seat rods 22 and linking cross member 24 is used on the other side of spline section 26b.
      <br/>
      Referring now to FIG. 3, a seat cover 30 is shown is fastened around one of the pair of seat rod cross members 24 by sewing or stapling on one edge of the seat cover 30.
      <br/>
      Sewn into an opposing edge of the seat cover 30 are small hooks 30a of sufficient radius that can grab and hold the opposing seat rod cross member 24.
      <br/>
      This effectively suspends seat cover 30 between said seat rod cross members 24.
      <br/>
      A lower surface of seat cover 30 rests upon the top edges of seat rods 22.
      <br/>
      The upper surface provides a level surface where one may rest upon in a sitting position.
      <br/>
      In the retracted configuration, said seat cover 30 is unhooked from the opposing seat rod cross member 24 and rolled up in such a fashion that it can be inserted into cavities 26a located in the upper end of shaft 40 next to seat rods 22 located on that side of said spline section 26b.
      <br/>
      Seat rods 22 are inserted into shaft 40 and stored in the cavity (marked as cavity 26a) between the flat surface of spline section 26b and the inner wall of shaft 40.
      <br/>
      Similarly, seat rods 22 and cross member 24 on the opposite side of said spline section 26b are retracted and inserted into cavity 26a now present in shaft 40 when upper shaft 26 is placed into the retracted configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Referring now to FIG. 7, the detail of the retractable seat assembly 42 is shown.
      <br/>
      Pivoting handle 20 is connected to the top of the sidewall of shaft 40 via a hinge 21.
      <br/>
      When deployed, handle 20 simply pivots out of the way.
      <br/>
      Seat rods 22 are extracted from within shaft 40 by pressing push button 35 and pulling upper shaft 26 from within the cavity of shaft 40.
      <br/>
      Upper seat collar 27 is permanently fixed around upper shaft 26 and located just beneath where seat rods 22 are pivotally fixed to upper shaft 26.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Referring now to FIG. 8, the detail of seat rods 22, cross members 24, and seat cover 30 is shown in the retracted configuration.
      <br/>
      Handle 20 is locked in the upright position to give a user a firm surface to grip onto and rest some of their body weight upon when walking.
      <br/>
      As previously described, seat rods 22, cross members 24, and seat cover 30 are stored ready for deployment in the cavity 26a formed in shaft 40 when upper shaft 26 is in the retracted position.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Referring now to FIGS. 9 and 10, shown is a cutaway side view and bottom view respectively, of the bottom end of shaft 40 displaying the detail of a leg assembly of a Seat Cane 10 according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      A plurality of four legs 50 are pivotally attached at the lower end of lower shaft 51 on a spline section 51a specifically formed therefor.
      <br/>
      Spline section 51a has a pair of parallel opposing surfaces.
      <br/>
      Legs 50 are pivotally attached via a pair of flared pins 50a and aperture 50b arrangement.
      <br/>
      Each flared pin 50a is interference in a corresponding aperture 50b specially formed therefor in the splined section 51a of shaft 51.
      <br/>
      One pair of legs 50 are provided on each side of said spline section 51a.
      <br/>
      A plurality of four channels 54 are provided spaced radially around the outer circumference of the bottom sidewall of the bottom end of shaft 40.
      <br/>
      Channels 50 are specially formed to receive legs 54 and provide support therefor.
      <br/>
      Like the channels 25 provided for seat rods 22, channels 54 are spaced forty five degrees from the associated channel on the same side on spline section 51a.
      <br/>
      A spring loaded push button 55 is provided to lock the entire assembly inside the hollow cavity in the bottom end of shaft 40 until such time as it is desired to deploy the legs 50.
      <br/>
      A rubber tip 60b is provided on the lower end of each of said legs 50 to provide a non-slip grip for the entire assembly when placed on a surface.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Referring now to FIG. 11, shown is a top view of a Cane Seat 10 according to an alternate preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      An additional articulating linking cross member 70 has been added to each pair of seat rods 22 approximately midway between the outer cross members 24 and shaft 40.
      <br/>
      Each of a pair of sliding locks 75 is provided to keep each linking cross member 70 in place and stiffening the seat assembly 42.
      <br/>
      A tab lock 80 (shown in FIG. 12) which clamps articulating seat rods 22 and seat rod cross members 24 together may be used instead of retaining clip 22c.
      <br/>
      This same tab lock 80 may also be modified to lock all seat sections together should an additional articulating brace 82 be added (shown on the left side of FIG. 11) on one or both of the outer sides to provide additional support to the seat rod structure.
