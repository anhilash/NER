    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">1 TECHNICAL FIELD</p>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates in part to processes for selectively producing one or more substituted or unsubstituted epsilon caprolactones and/or hydrates and/or esters thereof or reaction mixtures containing one or more substituted or unsubstituted epsilon caprolactones and/or hydrates and/or esters thereof.
      <br/>
      This invention also relates in part to reaction mixtures containing one or more substituted or unsubstituted epsilon caprolactones and/or hydrates and/or esters thereof as the desired product(s) of reaction.

    <p num="3">2 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="4">
      Epsilon caprolactone and/or certain hydrates and/or certain esters thereof are valuable intermediates which are useful, for example, in the production of epsilon caprolactam and polyesters.
      <br/>
      The processes currently used to produce epsilon caprolactone and/or hydrates and/or esters thereof have various disadvantages.
      <br/>
      For example, the starting materials used to produce epsilon caprolactone and/or hydrates and/or esters thereof are relatively expensive.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it would be desirable to produce epsilon caprolactone and/or hydrates and/or esters thereof from relatively inexpensive starting materials and by a process which does not have the disadvantages of prior art processes.

    <p num="5">3 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="6">It has been discovered that alcohols possessing internal olefinic unsaturation can be converted to epsilon caprolactones and/or hydrates and/or esters thereof In particular, it has been surprisingly discovered that penten-1-ols, e.g., 3-penten-1-ols, can be converted to epsilon caprolactones, e.g., epsilon caprolactone, and/or hydrates and/or esters thereof by employing catalysts having carbonylation/isomerization capabilities.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="25">Hydrocarbonylation Step or Stage</p>
    <p num="26">
      The hydrocarbonylation stage or step involves converting one or more substituted or unsubstituted alkadienes to one or more substituted or unsubstituted unsaturated alcohols.
      <br/>
      The hydrocarbonylation stage or step may be conducted in one or more steps or stages, preferably a one step process.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term "hydrocarbonylation" is contemplated to include all permissible hydrocarbonylation processes which involve converting one or more substituted or unsubstituted alkadienes to one or more substituted or unsubstituted unsaturated alcohols.
      <br/>
      In general, the hydrocarbonylation step or stage comprises reacting one or more substituted or unsubstituted alkadienes, e.g., butadienes, with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a metal-ligand complex catalyst, e.g., a metal-organophosphorus ligand complex catalyst, and a promoter and optionally free ligand to produce one or more substituted or unsubstituted unsaturated alcohols, e.g., penten-1-ols.
      <br/>
      A preferred hydrocarbonylation process useful in this invention is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/843,381, filed on an even date herewith, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The hydrocarbonylation stage or step involves the production of unsaturated alcohols by reacting an alkadiene with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a metal-ligand complex catalyst and optionally free ligand in a liquid medium that also contains a promoter.
      <br/>
      The reaction may be carried out in a continuous single pass mode in a continuous gas recycle manner or more preferably in a continuous liquid catalyst recycle manner as described below.
      <br/>
      The hydrocarbonylation processing techniques employable herein may correspond to any known processing techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The hydrocarbonylation process mixtures employable herein includes any solution derived from any corresponding hydrocarbonylation process that may contain at least some amount of four different main ingredients or components, i.e., the unsaturated alcohol product, a metal-ligand complex catalyst, a promoter and optionally free ligand, said ingredients corresponding to those employed and/or produced by the hydrocarbonylation process from whence the hydrocarbonylation process mixture starting material may be derived.
      <br/>
      By "free ligand" is meant ligand that is not complexed with (tied to or bound to) the metal, e.g., rhodium atom, of the complex catalyst.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the hydrocarbonylation process mixture compositions employable herein can and normally will contain minor amounts of additional ingredients such as those which have either been deliberately employed in the hydrocarbonylation process or formed in situ during said process.
      <br/>
      Examples of such ingredients that can also be present include unreacted alkadiene starting material, carbon monoxide and hydrogen gases, and in situ formed type products, such as saturated alcohols and/or unreacted isomerized olefins corresponding to the alkadiene starting materials, and high boiling liquid byproducts, as well as other inert co-solvent type materials or hydrocarbon additives, if employed.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The catalysts useful in the hydrocarbonylation stage or step include metal-ligand complex catalysts.
      <br/>
      The permissible metals which make up the metal-ligand complexes include Group 8, 9 and 10 metals selected from rhodium (Rh), cobalt (Co), iridium (Ir), ruthenium (Ru), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), osmium (Os) and mixtures thereof, with the preferred metals being rhodium, cobalt, iridium and ruthenium, more preferably rhodium, cobalt and ruthenium, especially rhodium.
      <br/>
      The permissible ligands include, for example, organophosphorus, organoarsenic and organoantimony ligands, or mixtures thereof, preferably organophosphorus ligands.
      <br/>
      The permissible organophosphorus ligands which make up the metal-organophosphorus ligand complexes and free organophosphorus ligand include mono-, di-, tri- and higher poly-(organophosphorus) compounds, preferably those of high basicity and low steric bulk.
      <br/>
      Illustrative permissible organophosphorus ligands include, for example, organophosphines, organophosphites, organophosphonites, organophosphinites, organophosphorus nitrogen-containing ligands, organophosphorus sulfur-containing ligands, organophosphorus silicon-containing ligands and the like.
      <br/>
      Other permissible ligands include, for example, heteroatom-containing ligands such as described in U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/818,781, filed Mar. 10, 1997, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Mixtures of such ligands may be employed if desired in the metal-ligand complex catalyst and/or free ligand and such mixtures may be the same or different.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that the successful practice of this invention does not depend and is not predicated on the exact structure of the metal-ligand complex species, which may be present in their mononuclear, dinuclear and/or higher nuclearity forms.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the exact structure is not known.
      <br/>
      Although it is not intended herein to be bound to any theory or mechanistic discourse, it appears that the catalytic species may in its simplest form consist essentially of the metal in complex combination with the ligand and carbon monoxide when used.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The term "complex" as used herein and in the claims means a coordination compound formed by the union of one or more electronically rich molecules or atoms capable of independent existence with one or more electronically poor molecules or atoms, each of which is also capable of independent existence.
      <br/>
      For example, the ligands employable herein, i.e., organophosphorus ligands, may possess one or more phosphorus donor atoms, each having one available or unshared pair of electrons which are each capable of forming a coordinate covalent bond independently or possibly in concert (e.g., via chelation) with the metal.
      <br/>
      Carbon monoxide (which is also properly classified as a ligand) can also be present and complexed with the metal.
      <br/>
      The ultimate composition of the complex catalyst may also contain an additional ligand, e.g., hydrogen or an anion satisfying the coordination sites or nuclear charge of the metal.
      <br/>
      Illustrative additional ligands include, e.g., halogen (Cl, Br, I), alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, acyl, CF3, C2 F5, CN, (R)2 PO and RP(O)(OH)O (wherein each R is the same or different and is a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radical, e.g., the alkyl or aryl), acetate, acetylacetonate, SO4, BF4, PF6, NO2, NO3, CH3 O, CH2.dbd.CHCH2, CH3 CH.dbd.CHCH2, C6 H5 CN, CH3 CN, NO, NH3, pyridine, (C2 H5)3 N, mono-olefins, diolefins and triolefins, tetrahydrofuran, and the like.
      <br/>
      It is of course to be understood that the complex species are preferably free of any additional organic ligand or anion that might poison the catalyst and have an undue adverse effect on catalyst performance.
      <br/>
      It is preferred in the metal-ligand complex catalyzed hydrocarbonylation processes that the active catalysts be free of halogen and sulfur directly bonded to the metal, although such may not be absolutely necessary.
      <br/>
      Preferred metal-ligand complex catalysts include rhodium-organophosphine ligand complex catalysts.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The number of available coordination sites on such metals is well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Thus the catalytic species may comprise a complex catalyst mixture, in their monomeric, dimeric or higher nuclearity forms, which are preferably characterized by at least one phosphorus-containing molecule complexed per metal, e.g., rhodium.
      <br/>
      As noted above, it is considered that the catalytic species of the preferred catalyst employed in the hydrocarbonylation stage or step may be complexed with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in addition to the organophosphorus ligands in view of the carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas employed by the hydrocarbonylation stage or step.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Among the organophosphines that may serve as the ligand of the metal-organophosphine complex catalyst and/or free organophosphine ligand of the hydrocarbonylation process mixture starting materials are mono-, di-, tri- and poly-(organophosphines) such as triorganophosphines, trialkylphosphines, alkyldiarylphosphines, dialkylarylphosphines, dicycloalkylarylphosphines, cycloalkyldiarylphosphines, triaralkylphosphines, tricycloalkylphosphines, and triarylphosphines, alkyl and/or aryl diphosphines and bisphosphine mono oxides, as well as ionic triorganophosphines containing at least one ionic moiety selected from the salts of sulfonic acid, of carboxylic acid, of phosphonic acid and of quaternary ammonium compounds, and the like.
      <br/>
      Of course any of the hydrocarbon radicals of such tertiary non-ionic and ionic organophosphines may be substituted if desired, with any suitable substituent that does not unduly adversely affect the desired result of the hydrocarbonylation process.
      <br/>
      The organophosphine ligands employable in the hydrocarbonylation stage or step and/or methods for their preparation are known in the art.

      The preferred organophosphorus ligands which make up the metal-organophosphorus ligand complex catalysts and free organophosphorus ligands are high basicity ligands.

      The metal-ligand complex catalysts employable in this invention may be formed by methods known in the art.
      <br/>
      The metal-ligand complex catalysts may be in homogeneous or heterogeneous form.
      <br/>
      For instance, preformed metal hydrido-carbonyl-organophosphorus ligand catalysts may be prepared and introduced into the reaction mixture of a hydrocarbonylation process.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the metal-ligand complex catalysts can be derived from a metal catalyst precursor which may be introduced into the reaction medium for in situ formation of the active catalyst.
      <br/>
      For example, rhodium catalyst precursors such as rhodium dicarbonyl acetylacetonate, Rh2 O3, Rh4 (CO)12, Rh6 (CO)16, Rh(NO3)3 and the like may be introduced into the reaction mixture along with the organophosphorus ligand for the in situ formation of the active catalyst.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment of this invention, rhodium dicarbonyl acetylacetonate is employed as a rhodium precursor and reacted in the presence of a promoter with the organophosphine ligand to form a catalytic rhodium-organophosphine ligand complex precursor which is introduced into the reactor along with excess free organophosphine ligand for the in situ formation of the active catalyst.
      <br/>
      In any event, it is sufficient for the purpose of this invention that carbon monoxide, hydrogen and organophosphorus compound are all ligands that are capable of being complexed with the metal and that an active metal-organophosphorus ligand catalyst is present in the reaction mixture under the conditions used in the hydrocarbonylation process.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      More particularly, a catalyst precursor composition can be formed consisting essentially of a solubilized metal-ligand complex precursor catalyst, a promoter and free ligand.
      <br/>
      Such precursor compositions may be prepared by forming a solution of a metal starting material, such as a metal oxide, hydride, carbonyl or salt, e.g. a nitrate, which may or may not be in complex combination with an organophosphorus ligand as defined herein.
      <br/>
      Any suitable metal starting material may be employed, e.g. rhodium dicarbonyl acetylacetonate, Rh2 O3, Rh4 (CO)12, Rh6 (CO)16, Rh(NO3)3, and organophosphorus ligand rhodium carbonyl hydrides.
      <br/>
      Carbonyl and organophosphorus ligands, if not already complexed with the initial metal, may be complexed to the metal either prior to or in situ during the hydrocarbonylation process.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      By way of illustration, the preferred catalyst precursor composition of this invention consists essentially of a solubilized rhodium carbonyl organophosphine ligand complex precursor catalyst, a promoter and free organophosphine ligand prepared by forming a solution of rhodium dicarbonyl acetylacetonate, a promoter and an organophosphine ligand as defined herein.
      <br/>
      The organophosphine ligand readily replaces one of the carbonyl ligands of the rhodium acetylacetonate complex precursor at room temperature as witnessed by the evolution of carbon monoxide gas.
      <br/>
      This substitution reaction may be facilitated by heating the solution if desired.
      <br/>
      Any suitable organic solvent in which both the rhodium dicarbonyl acetylacetonate complex precursor and rhodium organophosphine ligand complex precursor are soluble can be employed.
      <br/>
      The amounts of rhodium complex catalyst precursor, organic solvent and organophosphine ligand, as well as their preferred embodiments present in such catalyst precursor compositions may obviously correspond to those amounts employable in the hydrocarbonylation stage or step.
      <br/>
      Experience has shown that the acetylacetonate ligand of the precursor catalyst is replaced after the hydrocarbonylation process has begun with a different ligand, e.g., hydrogen, carbon monoxide or organophosphine ligand, to form the active complex catalyst as explained above.
      <br/>
      In a continuous process, the acetylacetone which is freed from the precursor catalyst under hydrocarbonylation conditions is removed from the reaction medium with the product alcohol and thus is in no way detrimental to the hydrocarbonylation process.
      <br/>
      The use of such preferred rhodium complex catalytic precursor compositions provides a simple economical and efficient method for handling the rhodium precursor metal and hydrocarbonylation start-up.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Accordingly, the metal-ligand complex catalysts used in the process of this invention consists essentially of the metal complexed with carbon monoxide and a ligand, said ligand being bonded (complexed) to the metal in a chelated and/or non-chelated fashion.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the terminology "consists essentially of", as used herein, does not exclude, but rather includes, hydrogen complexed with the metal, in addition to carbon monoxide and the ligand.
      <br/>

      Materials in amounts which unduly adversely poison or unduly deactivate the catalyst are not desirable and so the catalyst most desirably is free of contaminants such as metal-bound halogen (e.g., chlorine, and the like) although such may not be absolutely necessary.

      The concentration of the promoter employed will depend upon the details of the catalyst system employed.
      <br/>
      Without wishing to be bound by theory, the promoter component must be sufficiently acidic and in sufficient concentration to transfer a hydrogen ion to or otherwise activate the catalyst-bound acyl or other intermediate.
      <br/>
      It is believed that a promoter component acidity or concentration which is insufficient to transfer a hydrogen ion to or otherwise activate the catalyst-bound acyl or other intermediate will result in the formation of pentenal products, rather than the preferred penten-1-ol products.
      <br/>
      The ability of a promoter component to transfer a hydrogen ion to or otherwise activate the catalyst-bound acyl or other intermediate may be governed by several factors, for example, the concentration of the promoter component, the intrinsic acidity of the promoter component (the pKa), the composition of the reaction medium (e.g., the reaction solvent) and the temperature.
      <br/>
      Promoters are chosen on the basis of their ability to transfer a hydrogen ion to or otherwise activate such a catalyst-bound acyl or other intermediate under reaction conditions sufficient to result in the formation of alcohol products, but not so high as to result in detrimental side reactions of the catalyst, reactants or products.
      <br/>
      In cases where the promoter component acidity or concentration is insufficient to do so, aldehyde products (e.g., pentenals) are initially formed which may or may not be subsequently converted to unsaturated alcohols, e.g., penten-1-ols.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      In general, a less basic metal-bound acyl will require a higher concentration of the promoter component or a more acidic promoter component to protonate or otherwise activate it fully, such that the products are more desired penten-1-ols, rather than pentenals.
      <br/>
      This can be achieved by appropriate choice of promoter component.
      <br/>
      For example, an enabling concentration of protonated or otherwise activated catalyst-bound acyl or other intermediate can be achieved though the use of a large concentration of a mildly acidic promoter component, or through the use of a smaller concentration of a more acidic component.
      <br/>
      The promoter component is selected based upon its ability to produce the desired concentration of protonated or otherwise activated catalyst-bound acyl or other intermediate in the reaction medium under reaction conditions.
      <br/>
      In general, the intrinsic strength of an acidic material is generally defined in aqueous solution as the pKa, and not in reaction media commonly employed in hydrocarbonylation.
      <br/>
      The choice of the promoter and its concentration is made based in part upon the theoretical or equivalent pH that the promoter alone at such concentration gives in aqueous solution at 22 (degree)  C. The desired theoretical or equivalent pH of promoter component solutions should be greater than 0, preferably from about 1-12, more preferably from about 2-10 and most preferably from 4-8.
      <br/>
      The theoretical or equivalent pH can be readily calculated from values of pKa's at the appropriate promoter component concentration by reference to standard tables such as those found in "Ionization Constants of Organic Acids in Aqueous Solution" (IUPAC Chemical Data Series--No. 23) by E. P Serjeant and Boyd Dempsey, Pergamon Press (1979) and "Dissociation Constants of Inorganic Acids and Bases in Aqueous Solution" (IUPAC Chemical Data Series--No. 19, by D. D. Perrin, Pergamon Press.

      As indicated above, it is generally preferred to carry out the hydrocarbonylation stage or step in a continuous manner.
      <br/>
      In general, continuous hydrocarbonylation processes may involve: (a) hydrocarbonylating the alkadiene starting material(s) with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a liquid homogeneous reaction mixture comprising a solvent, the metal-ligand complex catalyst, and free ligand; (b) maintaining reaction temperature and pressure conditions favorable to the hydrocarbonylation of the alkadiene starting material(s); (c) supplying make-up quantities of the alkadiene starting material(s), carbon monoxide and hydrogen to the reaction medium as those reactants are used up; and (d) recovering the desired alcohol hydrocarbonylation product(s) in any manner desired.
      <br/>
      The continuous reaction can be carried out in a single pass mode, i.e., wherein a vaporous mixture comprising unreacted alkadiene starting material(s) and vaporized alcohol product is removed from the liquid reaction mixture from whence the alcohol product is recovered and make-up alkadiene starting material(s), carbon monoxide and hydrogen are supplied to the liquid reaction medium for the next single pass through without recycling the unreacted alkadiene starting material(s).
      <br/>
      However, it is generally desirable to employ a continuous reaction that involves either a liquid and/or gas recycle procedure.
      <br/>
      Such types of recycle procedure are known in the art and may involve the liquid recycling of the metal-ligand complex catalyst solution separated from the desired alcohol reaction product(s).
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      As indicated above, the hydrocarbonylation stage or step may involve a liquid catalyst recycle procedure.
      <br/>
      Such liquid catalyst recycle procedures are known in the art.
      <br/>
      For instance, in such liquid catalyst recycle procedures it is commonplace to continuously or intermittently remove a portion of the liquid reaction product medium, containing, e.g., the alcohol product, the solubilized metal-ligand complex catalyst, free ligand, and organic solvent, as well as byproducts produced in situ by the hydrocarbonylation and unreacted alkadiene starting material, carbon monoxide and hydrogen (syn gas) dissolved in said medium, from the hydrocarbonylation reactor, to a distillation zone, e.g., a vaporizer/separator wherein the desired alcohol product is distilled in one or more stages under normal, reduced or elevated pressure, as appropriate, and separated from the liquid medium.
      <br/>
      The vaporized or distilled desired alcohol product so separated may then be condensed and recovered in any conventional manner as discussed above.
      <br/>
      The remaining non-volatilized liquid residue which contains metal-ligand complex catalyst, solvent, free ligand and usually some undistilled alcohol product is then recycled back, with or with out further treatment as desired, along with whatever by-product and non-volatilized gaseous reactants that might still also be dissolved in said recycled liquid residue, in any conventional manner desired, to the hydrocarbonylation reactor, such as disclosed e.g., in the above-mentioned patents.
      <br/>
      Moreover the reactant gases so removed by such distillation from the vaporizer may also be recycled back to the reactor if desired.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      Recovery and purification of unsaturated alcohols may be by any appropriate means, and may include distillation, phase separation, extraction, precipitation, absorption, crystallization, membrane separation, derivative formation and other suitable means.
      <br/>
      For example, a crude reaction product can be subjected to a distillation-separation at atmospheric or reduced pressure through a packed distillation column.
      <br/>
      Reactive distillation may be useful in conducting the hydrocarbonylation reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      As indicated above, at the conclusion of (or during) the hydrocarbonylation process, the desired unsaturated alcohols, e.g., penten-1-ols, may be recovered from the reaction mixtures used in the process of this invention.
      <br/>
      For instance, in a continuous liquid catalyst recycle reaction the portion of the liquid reaction mixture (containing penten-1-ol product, catalyst, etc.) removed from the reactor can be passed to a vaporizer/separator wherein the desired alcohol product can be separated via distillation, in one or more stages, under normal, reduced or elevated pressure, from the liquid reaction solution, condensed and collected in a product receiver, and further purified if desired.
      <br/>
      The remaining non-volatilized catalyst containing liquid reaction mixture may then be recycled back to the reactor as may, if desired, any other volatile materials, e.g., unreacted alkadiene, together with any hydrogen and carbon monoxide dissolved in the liquid reaction after separation thereof from the condensed penten-1-ol product, e.g., by distillation in any conventional manner.
      <br/>
      It is generally desirable to employ an organophosphorus ligand whose molecular weight exceeds that of the higher boiling alcohol oligomer byproduct corresponding to the penten-1-ols being produced in the hydrocarbonylation process.
      <br/>
      Another suitable recovery technique is solvent extraction or crystallization.
      <br/>
      In general, it is preferred to separate the desired unsaturated alcohols from the catalyst-containing reaction mixture under reduced pressure and at low temperatures so as to avoid possible degradation of the organophosphorus ligand and reaction products.
      <br/>
      When an alpha-mono-olefin reactant is also employed, the alcohol derivative thereof can also be separated by the above methods.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      More particularly, distillation and separation of the desired alcohol product from the metal-ligand complex catalyst containing product solution may take place at any suitable temperature desired.
      <br/>
      In general, it is recommended that such distillation take place at relatively low temperatures, such as below 150 (degree)  C., and more preferably at a temperature in the range of from about 50 (degree)  C. to about 130 (degree)  C. It is also generally recommended that such alcohol distillation take place under reduced pressure, e.g., a total gas pressure that is substantially lower than the total gas pressure employed during hydrocarbonylation when low boiling alcohols (e.g., C5 and C6) are involved or under vacuum when high boiling alcohols (e.g. C7 or greater) are involved.
      <br/>
      For instance, a common practice is to subject the liquid reaction product medium removed from the hydrocarbonylation reactor to a pressure reduction so as to volatilize a substantial portion of the unreacted gases dissolved in the liquid medium which now contains a much lower synthesis gas concentration than was present in the hydrocarbonylation process medium to the distillation zone, e.g. vaporizer/separator, wherein the desired alcohol product is distilled.
      <br/>
      In general, distillation pressures ranging from vacuum pressures on up to total gas pressure of about 50 psig should be sufficient for most purposes.
