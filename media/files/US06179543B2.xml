      Field of Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates generally to motor vehicle racks used to carry large, burdensome items such as ladders, pipes, and cable.
      <br/>
      More specifically, this invention relates to such racks which can be moved between two positions, �1� a first secured position generally utilized when the vehicle is in motion wherein the rack is securely disposed above the motor vehicle and the item is secured on the rack and �2� a second accessible position generally utilized when the item is being loaded and unloaded from the rack wherein the rack is adjacent to one side of the motor vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A number of different racks exist in the prior art.
      <br/>
      Illustrative of such movable racks are U.S. Pat. No. 5,058,791 issued to Henriquez et al. on Oct. 22, 1991; U.S. Pat. No. 5,297,912 issued to Levi on Mar. 29, 1994; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,398,778 issued to Sexton on Mar. 21, 1995.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Each invention described in the listed patents includes a number of pivot points and/or rotating elements.
      <br/>
      Rotating elements and pivot points are inherently weak points in a design.
      <br/>
      Thus, it would be beneficial to the art to provide a rack having a minimal number of pivot points and rotating elements thereby increasing the overall strength of the rack.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In addition, none of the racks described in the listed patents are adjustable to securely carry items, specially ladders, having different widths.
      <br/>
      Thus, it would be beneficial to the art to provide a rack which is adjustable enabling it to securely carry ladders and other items having different widths.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Furthermore, the great majority of prior art racks that are movable between a secured position and an accessible position experience an instability problem as the rack is moved between the two positions.
      <br/>
      The instability problem is caused by the sudden extra weight contributed by the ladder once the center of gravity of the ladder moves "overcenter".
      <br/>
      This sudden extra weight provides an abrupt "jerk" on the operator's hold which may cause the operator's hold on the pivoting arm of the rack to slip, potentially resulting in property damage to the ladder, rack, and/or vehicle.
      <br/>
      Thus, it would be beneficial to the art to provide a rack which does not experience the instability problem experienced by prior art racks.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Finally, a number of different types of work vehicles exist, including vans and pick-up trucks, most of which have the need for a rack.
      <br/>
      Each vehicle type has different overall dimensions.
      <br/>
      In addition, obvious structural differences exist between pick-up trucks and vans which affect the placement and attachment of a rack to the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Thus, it would be beneficial to the art to provide a rack that is adjustable to fit a large number of vehicle types.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">Accordingly, the objectives of this invention are to provide, inter alia, a motor vehicle rack that:</p>

    <p num="11">
      To achieve such improvements, my invention is a ladder rack for motor vehicles including at least two support mechanisms for supporting an item such as a ladder, a pivoting means for concurrently pivoting each of the support mechanisms between a first position and a second position, and a motion stabilizer mechanism mounted on each of the support mechanisms.
      <br/>
      In the first position, each of the support mechanisms is securely disposed above the vehicle over the vehicle's roof.
      <br/>
      When in the first position, the item is secured on the support mechanisms against movement.
      <br/>
      In the second position, each of the support mechanisms is disposed adjacent to a side of the vehicle thereby enabling easy loading and unloading of the ladder from the rack.
      <br/>
      The motion stabilizer mechanism stabilizes and guides the motion of the ladder as the rack is moved between the first and second positions.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the rack additionally includes a width adjustment means for adjusting the ladder size carrying capacity of the support mechanisms.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      The preferred embodiment of my invention is shown in FIGS. 1 through 11 and the rack is depicted as 5.
      <br/>
      It is understood that rack 5 may support any of a variety of large and burdensome items as previously listed.
      <br/>
      However, because ladders are the most common item carried by comparable racks, a ladder 15 will be the item illustrated and described herein as being carried by rack 5.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, as part of the inventive concept, rack 5 includes parts specially made for the transportation and securement of a ladder 15.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In general, rack 5 comprises at least two support mechanisms 20, a pivoting means 100, a motion stabilizer mechanism 50, and a mounting means 400.
      <br/>
      Ladder 15 rests on support mechanisms 20.
      <br/>
      Mounting means 400 fixedly attaches pivoting means 100 to vehicle 8.
      <br/>
      Pivoting means 100 pivots each of the support mechanisms 20 between a first position 120 (as shown in FIGS. 1, 6, and 10) and a second position 140 (as shown in FIGS. 2 and 9).
      <br/>
      In the first position 120, the support mechanisms 20 are securely disposed above a motor vehicle 8 with ladder 15 securely resting on the support mechanisms 20.
      <br/>
      First position 120 is usually employed when vehicle 8 is in motion and/or when ladder 15 is required to be secured in place.
      <br/>
      In the second position 140, the support mechanisms 20 are disposed adjacent to a side 9 of vehicle 8 thereby permitting ladder 15 to be easily loaded or unloaded from vehicle 8.
      <br/>
      Second position 140 is normally utilized when an operator loads or unloads ladder 15 from rack 5.
      <br/>
      Motion stabilizer mechanism 50 stabilizes and guides the motion of ladder 15 ensuring that the transition of rack 5 between first position 120 and second position 140 is smooth, steady, and not erratic.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Each support mechanism 20 comprises at least one support bar 30, at least one link bar 25, a securing mechanism 35, and a width adjustment means 70.
      <br/>
      Ladder 15 rests on support bar(s) 30. Link bar 25 links support bar 30 to pivoting means 100.
      <br/>
      Securing mechanism 35 secures ladder 15 to support mechanism 20 while support mechanism 20 is in first position 120.

      In one preferred embodiment as best shown in FIG. 3, anchor brace 160 consists of one main brace component 162 and two secondary brace components 164.
      <br/>
      Main brace component 162 and both secondary brace components 164 are generally rectangular in shape.
      <br/>
      One of the secondary brace components 164 extends from one edge 163 of main brace component 162 in a direction normal to main brace component 162.

      Each side unit section 224 extends from one edge 223 of its corresponding top unit section 222 in a direction normal to top unit section 222.
      <br/>
      The perpendicular attachment of each side unit section 224 to its corresponding top unit section 222 thus furnishes each anchor brace unit 220 with a generally "L"-shape.

      The two most common types of work motor vehicles 8 include vans, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, and pick-up trucks, as shown in FIG. 6.

      The majority of van-type vehicles 8 are normally equipped with at least two bows 12.
      <br/>
      Each bow 12 is an elongated strip of steel, or a like metal material, which is bent at its middle.
      <br/>
      Each end of the bow 12 is attached to one of the sides of the roof 10 of the van 8 by a bow brace 13 so that the "bend" or "hump" of the bow 12 is located at the center of the roof 10 of the van 8.

      In order to fit different widths of horizontal elements 215, a user may utilize the embodiment of anchor brace 160 which includes the two anchor brace units 220.

      In this embodiment, the two anchor brace units 220 are attached, by either their top unit section 222 or their side unit section 224, to the horizontal element 215 so that the two anchor brace units 220 oppose each other in the transverse direction of horizontal element 215.

      In such truck vehicles 8, each support mechanism 20 rests on the corresponding horizontal element 215 when rack 5 is in the first position 120.

    <p num="54">In Operation</p>
    <p num="55">
      In operation, to load a ladder 15 onto rack 5, an operator must move rack 5 from the first position 120 to the second position 140.
      <br/>
      The operator must first release lever locking mechanism 190 (clamp 193 in the preferred embodiment) enabling pivoting lever 175 to rotate on its second end 186 about hinge 187 from inactive position 191 to active position 192.
      <br/>
      As previously mentioned, once in the active position 192, the angle between pivoting lever 175 and pivoting shaft 150 is approximately ninety degrees (90 (degree) ).
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      An operator next grips pivoting lever 175 by its handle 188 and begins to rotate the pivoting lever 175 from first position 120 in the direction of the Arrow A of FIG. 1 (the clockwise direction if facing the rear 11 of the vehicle 8).
      <br/>
      As the pivoting lever 175 is rotated in such direction, the support mechanisms 20, due to their attachment to the pivoting shaft 150, also begin to rotate in the same direction.
      <br/>
      After substantial rotation, the movement of the support mechanisms 20 and rack 5 cease because each link bar 25 impacts and is now supported by its corresponding stop pad 254.
      <br/>
      Thus, motion stop mechanism 250 stops the motion of rack 5 at the second position 140.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      It is imperative that all parts be sized and constructed so that, at the second position 140, the support mechanisms 20 are adjacent the side 9 of the vehicle 8.
      <br/>
      Preferably, all parts are sized and constructed so that, at second position 140, the angle between the support mechanisms 20 and the vehicle side 9 is an obtuse angle as shown in FIGS. 2 and 9.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The operator next lifts ladder 15 onto support mechanisms 20 and deposits one of the sides 16 of ladder 15 onto the hook section 58 of the hook mechanism 52 of each support mechanism 20.
      <br/>
      Thus, the ladder 15 is suspended from its side 16 by the hook mechanism 52 of each support mechanism 20.
      <br/>
      Next, the operator must adjust the width adjustment mechanism 70 (and thereby also the first bracket shoulder 38) so that the distance between first bracket shoulder 38 and second bracket shoulder 40 is slightly larger than the width of ladder 15 (the perpendicular distance between the two sides 16 of ladder 15).
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Next, the operator begins to rotate pivoting lever 175 in the direction of the Arrow B of FIG. 2 from the second position 140 into the first position 120 (rotation is in the counter-clockwise direction if facing the rear 11 of the vehicle 8).
      <br/>
      As the pivoting lever 175 is rotated in such direction, the link bars 25 lift from their respective stop pads 254, and the support mechanisms 20, due to their attachment to the pivoting shaft 150, also begin to rotate in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      As previously mentioned, motion stabilizer mechanism 50 stabilizes the motion of rack 5 and ladder 15 as the rack 5 is moved between the first position 120 and the second position 140.
      <br/>
      Initially in the second position 140, ladder 15 is suspended on the hook section 58 of the hook mechanisms 52.
      <br/>
      As the support mechanisms 20 move in the counter-clockwise direction, ladder 15 concurrently slides along and pivots about the slide means 55 of each hook mechanism 52 (slider band 56 in the preferred embodiment).
      <br/>
      The ladder 15 continues to slide along and pivot about slide means 55 until it comes to rest on support mechanism 20 as described below.
      <br/>
      The concurrent sliding and pivoting motion of the ladder 15 on slide means 55 ensures that the extra weight provided by the ladder 15 once the center of gravity of ladder 15 is overcenter is gradually and smoothly translated to the operator's hold on grip 188 and does not result in a sudden "jerk" on the operator's hold.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      After substantial rotation, ladder 15 comes to rest on support mechanisms 20, and the support mechanisms 20 as well as rack 5 will once again be positioned in the first position 120.
      <br/>
      In the first position 120 and since width adjustment means 70 has already been correctly adjusted, ladder 15 rests on the support mechanisms 20 with one ladder side 16 substantially abutting first bracket shoulder 38 and the other ladder side 16 substantially abutting second bracket shoulder 40.
      <br/>
      Due to the constriction of the ladder 15 in the lateral direction by first and second bracket shoulders, 38 and 40, and due to the inherent constriction of the ladder 15 in the longitudinal direction by the rungs 17 of the ladder 15 and third finger member 41 (which is included in hook mechanism 52 in the preferred embodiment), the ladder 15 is securely held on each support mechanism 20 by securing mechanism 35.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      After rotating the rack 5 from the second position 140 into the first position 120, the operator should rotate pivoting lever 175 about hinge 187.
      <br/>
      The operator should once again secure pivoting lever 175 by way of lever locking mechanism 190 (clamp 193 in the preferred embodiment).
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      In order to unload ladder 15 from rack 5, an operator need simply to repeat the loading steps in the reverse sequence.
      <br/>
      Once rack 5 is in the second position 140, an operator may easily lift suspended ladder 15 from the hook mechanism 52 of each support mechanism 20.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      If the overall length of the pivoting shaft 150 needs to be altered in order to better fit the dimensions of vehicle 8, an operator may easily do so by adjusting the pivoting shaft adjustment means 178.
      <br/>
      The overall length 172 of pivoting shaft 150 should be such that the portion of first pivoting bar member 174 which includes pivoting lever attachment means 185 (the suspended section 151) extends past the rear 11 of vehicle 8.
