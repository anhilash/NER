      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a reflective liquid crystal display apparatus and, more particularly, to an improvement in a reflective plate of a reflective liquid crystal display apparatus.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A reflective liquid crystal display apparatus does not require a back light as a light source because light obtained by reflecting external incident light by a reflective plate positioned inside the liquid crystal display apparatus is used as a display light source.
      <br/>
      This apparatus is considered to be an effective system for achieving a decrease in power consumption, a decrease in thickness, and a light weight, compared to a transparent liquid crystal display apparatus.
      <br/>
      The basic structure of a conventional reflective liquid crystal display apparatus comprises a liquid crystal of a TN (Twisted Nematic) scheme, an STN (Super Twisted Nematic) scheme, a GH (Guest Host) scheme, a PDLC (macromolecular dispersion) scheme, or the like, elements (e.g., thin film transistors or diodes) for switching the liquid crystal, and a reflective plate arranged on the inner or outer side of the elements.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The display performance of the reflective liquid crystal display apparatus is required to provide a bright, white display in a liquid crystal transmissive state.
      <br/>
      To realize this display performance, it is important to control the reflective properties of the reflective plate.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The surface of a conventional reflective plate is corrugated to reflect light incident at all angles by a reflective surface in a target direction (display direction).</p>
    <p num="7">Well-known corrugation shapes on the surfaces of reflective plates are as follows.</p>
    <p num="8">1 The pitch of corrugations falls within a range of 1  MU m to 100  MU m, the corrugation height falls within a range of 0.1  MU m to 10  MU m, the corrugation inclination angle is 0 (degree)  to 30 (degree)  with respect to the horizontal surface of a substrate, and intervals between the projecting portions of the corrugations are irregular (disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 61-6390).</p>
    <p num="9">2 The corrugation height exhibits the Gaussian distribution, and the average inclination angle of corrugations at this time is 10 (degree)  (disclosed in Tohru Koizumi and Tatsuo Uchida, Proceedings of the SID, Vol. 29, 157, 1988).</p>
    <p num="10">3 The surface of a reflective electrode has a plurality of projecting portions arrayed irregularly (disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 6-75237).</p>
    <p num="11">4 The surface of a reflective plate is a smooth corrugated surface, and the average inclination angle of corrugations is selected from 4 (degree)  to 15 (degree)  (disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 6-175126).</p>
    <p num="12">5 At least two or more projecting portions having different heights are formed on the surface of a reflective plate (disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 6-27481).</p>
    <p num="13">
      A conventional method of corrugating a reflective plate uses photolithography and etching which are performed to an organic film to uniformly corrugate a large-area substrate without causing any damage.
      <br/>
      To obtain a reflective plate having desired reflective properties, a corrugation shape on the surface of the reflective plate must be optimally designed.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In the above references of the reflective liquid crystal display apparatuses, the average inclination angle of corrugations is designated to optimize a corrugation shape.
      <br/>
      As for practical reflective performance, however, a flat region is included in the corrugation shape on the entire surface of the reflective plate, or corrugated surfaces having various inclination angles except for the inclination angle designated in the reference are present on the entire surface of the reflective plate.
      <br/>
      For this reason, it is difficult to obtain a bright reflective liquid crystal display apparatus having a reflective plate by designating only the average inclination angle described in the references.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the above references, the surface of the reflective plate is irregularly corrugated.
      <br/>
      However, these references are insufficient for defining a corrugated structure on the surface of the reflective plate having optimum reflective performance because designation of a detailed irregular shape is indefinite, and irregularity from a regular structure is not defined.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">The present invention has been made in consideration of the above situation in the conventional techniques, and has as its object to provide a reflective liquid crystal display apparatus with a reflective plate having a corrugated structure which is required for obtaining optimum reflective properties.</p>
    <p num="17">
      To achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided a reflective liquid crystal display apparatus having a structure in which a liquid crystal layer is sandwiched between an insulating substrate having a corrugated reflective plate as a pixel electrode and an insulating substrate having a transparent electrode, wherein the reflective plate is a reflective plate having an irregularly corrugated structure and satisfies any one of 1 to 6 in order to obtain a reflective plate having excellent scattering performance.

    <p num="23">6 the reflective plate which satisfies at least one of the conditions described in 1 to 5 has six or more projecting or recessed portions inside the surface of the pixel electrode.</p>
    <p num="24">According to the present invention, a corrugated reflective plate can be formed which is rarely affected by the use environment or can most efficiently utilize incident light for reflected light when the use environment is set.</p>
    <p num="25">
      With this reflective plate, a bright, high-quality reflective liquid crystal display apparatus can be provided.
      <br/>
      In addition, this reflective plate can be applied to not only a liquid crystal display apparatus but also various display apparatuses and the like.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="28">
      The present invention will be described in detail below.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a sectional view showing the structure of a reflective liquid crystal display apparatus used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, the reflective liquid crystal display apparatus has a structure in which a corrugated reflective plate 5 is defined as a pixel electrode, and a liquid crystal layer 11 is sandwiched between insulating substrates 13 and 10.
      <br/>
      The insulating substrate 13 has a switching element (e.g., a transistor) 6 connected to the reflective pixel electrode 5 to perform active-matrix driving.
      <br/>
      The insulating substrate 10 opposes the insulating substrate 13 and has a transparent electrode 3.
      <br/>
      On the insulating substrate 13 having the switching element and the reflective plate 5, this reflective plate 5 is obtained by forming a corrugated organic insulating layer 12 on the upper portion of the substrate 13 having the switching element 6 and a wiring portion, and covering the corrugated upper portion with a highly efficient reflective layer.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The inclination angle of corrugations on the surface of the reflective plate is changed to change the reflective properties of the reflective plate 5.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2A shows views for explaining corrugations on the surface of the reflective plate and the scattering properties of reflected light.
      <br/>
      In the case of a mirror surface having no corrugation on the surface of the reflective plate, light is reflected in the specular reflection direction of incident light.
      <br/>
      As the corrugation inclination angle increases (14 --&gt; 15 --&gt; 16), the reflected light spreads to increase the scattering properties (17 --&gt; 18 --&gt; 19).
      <br/>
      In particular, by setting the corrugation inclination angle at 5 (degree)  to 10 (degree) , a reflective plate having directivity suitable for a reflective liquid crystal display apparatus can be obtained.
      <br/>
      A brighter display performance can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      On the other hand, when the corrugated structure and corrugation shape of the reflective plate become irregular from a periodical structure and the same shape, the reflective properties of the reflective plate change from properties exhibiting coherence to properties exhibiting incoherence.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2B shows views for explaining the irregularity of corrugations on the surface of the reflective plate and the coherence of reflected light.
      <br/>
      When the corrugations on the surface of the reflective plate have the same shape to form a regular structure, the reflective properties exhibit a coherence phenomenon 23 having a peak.
      <br/>
      As the corrugation shape and structure become irregular (20 --&gt; 21 --&gt; 22), the peak of the coherence phenomenon decreases (indicated by reference numeral 24) and disappears (indicated by reference numeral 25).
      <br/>
      The optimum conditions for the corrugation inclination angle and the irregular structure which determine the reflective properties will be described below.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 3 shows the distribution of the distances between adjacent recessed or projecting portions on the surface of the reflective plate.
      <br/>
      Note that the average (PAV) of the distances between adjacent recessed (or projecting) portions was set at 5 to 20  MU m. A value obtained by standardizing (dividing) a full-width at half maximum 26 (RFWHM) in this distribution with the average distance was defined as the variation degree of the positions of recessed (or projecting) portions, i.e., a degree of freedom of pitch Rp (=RFWHM /RAV).
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows the reflective performance of an irregular structure changed from a periodically corrugated structure on the surface of the reflective plate upon a change in degree of freedom of pitch.
      <br/>
      The degrees of freedom of pitch were set at Rp=(a) 0, (b) 0.2, and (c) 0.3 for the reflective performance.
      <br/>
      In the case of a periodically corrugated structure (a), a peak exhibiting coherence appeared.
      <br/>
      With an increase in Rp, the peak value of the reflective properties decreased (b), and the coherence phenomenon disappeared (c).
      <br/>
      Then, continuous reflective performance could be obtained within viewing angles.
      <br/>
      By setting Rp &gt;= 0.3, a reflective plate exhibiting no coherence phenomenon can be obtained.
      <br/>
      This reflective plate having a corrugated surface indicated by reference numeral 22 in FIG. 2B is applied to a reflective liquid crystal display apparatus to obtain a colorless, high-quality display.
      <br/>
      Note that the distribution of the distances between adjacent recessed or projecting portions is not limited to the Gaussian distribution described in this embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 5 shows the relationships between the average (PAV) of the distances between adjacent recessed or projecting portions and reflective performance.
      <br/>
      The reflective performance is checked at PAV ( MU m)=(a) 500, (b) 200, (c) 100, and (d) 80. Note that Rp=0.6 is constant.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5, continuous reflective performance having a high reflection intensity can be obtained at PAV &lt;= 80  MU m within a range of an incident angle of -40 (degree)  to +40 (degree)  which greatly contributes to panel display performance.
      <br/>
      If PAV increases from the above value to c --&gt; b --&gt; a, the reflection intensity becomes discontinuous, and the average intensity also decreases.
      <br/>
      As a result, a display becomes dark.
      <br/>
      By setting the distance between adjacent projecting or recessed portions on the surface of the reflective plate to 80  MU m or less, a reflective plate having good reflective performance can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 6 shows the height distribution of corrugations on the surface of the reflective plate.
      <br/>
      A value obtained by standardizing a full-width at half maximum 27 (FFWHM) in the height distribution graph with the corrugation height average (Hav) is defined as a degree of freedom of height Rh (=HFWHM /Hav).
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 shows reflective performance at Rh=(a) 0.3, (b) 0.2, (c) 0.1, and (d) 0.
      <br/>
      By setting the degree of freedom of height to 0.2 or more, the coherence phenomenon disappears, and a colorless reflective plate under a white light can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Note that the height distribution is not limited to the Gaussian distribution described in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments to Rh is within a range of 0.2 and 0.9.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 8 is a view showing the sections of corrugation shapes on the surfaces of the reflective plates to explain the average inclination angles of the reflective plates.
      <br/>
      To obtain desired reflective performance, an irregularly corrugated structure is required comprising flat regions, identifiable individually as flat subregions, and corrugated subregions, so that the surfaces of the reflective plates have various corrugation shapes.
      <br/>
      The corrugations of each reflective plate have different inclination angles, i.e.,  ALPHA 1,  ALPHA 2, and  ALPHA 3 depending on target inclination angles.
      <br/>
      For this reason, when the average inclination angle on the surface of the reflected plate in the present invention is defined as K, K is indicated by the mean square of the inclination angles of all small regions in a length L inside a reflective pixel electrode.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 shows corrugation sections when the occupation ratios of flat regions inside the pixel electrodes as the reflective plates are different, i.e., (a) 0%, (b) 30%, and (c) 45%. FIG. 9 shows the reflective performance of the reflective plates corresponding to the ratios (a), (b), and (c).
      <br/>
      When the occupation ratio of all of the flat regions, or the total flat region inside the pixel electrode is high, the specular reflection component of the reflective performance is large, scattering properties become poor even with the same average inclination angle.
      <br/>
      Since the panel display of this reflective plate is dark, the reflective plate cannot be put into practical use.
      <br/>
      To the contrary, when the occupation ratio of the flat region is 20%, and the condition of the average inclination angle of the corrugated surface is satisfied, the specular reflection component of the reflective performance is not large.

      FIG. 10 shows the relationships between the average inclination angles and reflective performance (reflectivities) on the surface of the reflective plate when the condition of the flat region is satisfied. (Reference numerals in FIG. 10 denote average inclination angles.) The following display performance of a reflective display apparatus is required for practical use.
      <br/>
      That is, a panel must have a brightness or more of a sheet of newspaper, the viewing angle of this panel having such brightness must be -20 (degree)  to +20 (degree)  or more in a direction perpendicular to the panel, and the change ratio of brightness within this viewing angle must be 50% or less.
      <br/>
      The reflective performance which satisfies the above required display conditions can be realized only by setting the average inclination angle K at 5 (degree)  to 10 (degree) . This reflective plate is employed in a reflective liquid crystal display apparatus to obtain bright, clear, excellent display performance in practical use.

      It is found that a peak exhibiting coherence decreases with an increase in number of projecting (or recessed) portions to obtain continuous reflective performance having a high reflection intensity within a wide incident angle range.

    <p num="39">
      A reflective liquid crystal display apparatus used in Embodiment 1 of the present invention had the same structure as that shown in FIG. 1, provided that a pixel pitch is 300  MU m. An amorphous silicon thin film transistor (a-SiTFT) 6, a gate signal line 9, and a source signal line 7 are formed on the upper portion of a glass substrate 13 serving as an insulating substrate on a switching side.
      <br/>
      A reflective plate 5 serving as an aluminum reflective pixel electrode is formed on the upper portion of the resultant structure through a corrugated insulating interlayer 12.
      <br/>
      At this time, the reflective plate 5 is electrically connected to a drain electrode 8 of the a-SiTFT through a wiring portion 5a and functions as a pixel electrode.

      A liquid crystal of a guest host (GH) scheme is employed as a liquid crystal layer 11.

      An insulating substrate 10 on the opposite side has a transparent electrode 3 and a color filter 4.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In a corrugation forming process, the organic insulating film 12 was formed on the upper portion of the insulating substrate 13, on the switching side, having the switching element 6 and the wiring portion 5a formed thereon.
      <br/>
      In Embodiment 1, a polyimide film which could be corrugated and sufficiently satisfied the performance of an insulating interlayer was formed as the organic insulating film 12 to a film thickness of 2 to 4  MU m. At this time, the film was calcined at 200 (degree)  or less for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      A resist layer was formed on the upper portion.
      <br/>
      Recessed portion patterns in which the average of the distances between the centers of adjacent recessed portion patterns was 20  MU m, and the degree of freedom of pitch was 0.8 were exposed using a chromium mask which allows light to pass through.
      <br/>
      After the resultant structure was developed and patterned to corrugate the organic film, the resist was removed.
      <br/>
      With this process, there was provided corrugations in which the average of the distances between the centers of adjacent recessed portion patterns is 25  MU m and the degree of freedom of pitch Rp was 0.9. The maximum height of corrugations was 2  MU m, the degree of freedom of height Rh was 0.4, the average inclination angle of corrugations was 8 (degree) , and the occupation ratio of a region having an inclination angle of 0 (degree)  inside the pixel electrode was 6%.
      <br/>
      In addition, about 60 corrugations were present inside the pixel electrode.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, to form a contact hole, a resist was applied again, and patterning was performed.
      <br/>
      A hole was formed by dry etching.
      <br/>
      The etching conditions at this time were an etching gas of oxygen and carbon tetrafluoride, an RF power of 100 to 200 W, and a pressure of 50 to 100 mTorr.
      <br/>
      After the resist was removed, aluminum was formed to 300 to 500 nm by sputtering. P.R. and etching were performed, and the resist was removed to form the reflective pixel electrode 5.
      <br/>
      The reflective pixel electrode 5 had a desired corrugation shape in accordance with the corrugation shape of the polyimide underlayer.

    <p num="42">Note that, if MFR 305 available from Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd. or TMR-P3 available from TOKYO OHKA KOGYO CO., LTD. is used for corrugating the organic insulating interlayer 12, the corrugations formed by the above corrugation forming method can melt upon heating at about 170 (degree)  C. for about 10 minutes, thereby smoothing the corrugation shape.</p>

      The process of forming corrugations on the surface of a reflective plate was the same as that described in Embodiment 1, provided that the variation degree of the positions of recessed (or projecting) portions, i.e., the degree of freedom of pitch Rp was controlled by changing the positions and shapes of mask patterns used for forming corrugations.
      <br/>
      The degree of freedom of pitch Rp had the Gaussian distribution shape shown in FIG. 3.

      FIG. 4 shows the reflective performance of a corrugated reflective plate at Rp=(a) 0, (b) 0.2, and (c) 0.3. By setting Rp &gt;= 0.3, a reflective plate exhibiting no coherence phenomenon can be obtained.

      Note that the distribution of the distances between adjacent recessed or projecting portions is not limited to the Gaussian distribution described in Embodiment 2.
      <br/>
      This distance distribution can be freely set to a trapezoid, rectangular, or square distribution by controlling the above mask pattern conditions.

      <br/>
      The reflective performance of the reflective plate is the same as that shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      With PAV &lt;= 80  MU m, continuous reflective characteristics having a high reflection intensity can be obtained within a range of an incident angle of -40 (degree)  to +40 (degree)  which greatly contributes to panel display performance, compared to the reflective performance shown in FIG. 5.

      <br/>
      The reflective performance of this reflective plate is the same as that shown in FIG. 7.

      A coherence phenomenon disappears by setting the degree of freedom of height to 0.2 or more.

      A colorless reflective plate under a white light can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Note that the height distribution graph shown in FIG. 6 is not limited to the Gaussian distribution described in Embodiment 4.

      The process of forming corrugations on the surface of a reflective plate was the same as that described in Embodiment 1, provided that the pattern positions in a mask used for forming corrugations, and etching conditions were controlled so that the occupation ratio of a region having an inclination angle of 0 (degree)  with respect to the horizontal surface of the insulating substrate inside the surface of the reflective pixel electrode, and the average inclination angle of all corrugations on the surface in all azimuths on the pixel electrode were controlled.

      FIG. 10 shows the reflective performance of a reflective plate having different average inclination angles of corrugations formed by the above manufacturing method.

      Remaining corrugation conditions were the same as those for the reflective plate obtained in Embodiment 1 described above.

      FIG. 11 shows the properties of the reflective plate when the numbers of recessed (or projecting) portions are (a) 4, (b) 6, and (c) 8 inside the pixel electrode.

      In Embodiment 6, continuous, bright reflective performance free from coherence can be obtained within a wide incident angle range by setting the number of recessed (or projecting) portions to six or more.
      <br/>
      A reflective plate having good reflective performance can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Note that the same effect can be obtained under corrugation conditions except for those in this embodiment.
