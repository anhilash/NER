      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to an improvement of a super-twisted nematic liquid crystal display.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention relates to a STN type color liquid crystal display device to effect multicolor development without using a color filter.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Discussion of Background</p>
    <p num="4">When a passive addressing type liquid crystal display device such as a twisted nematic liquid crystal display device (TN-LCD) or a super-twisted nematic liquid crystal display device (STN-LCD) is driven for effecting a display, driving voltages are applied between electrodes according to a line successive selection method wherein either of a row electrode or a column electrode is determined as a scanning electrode and the other is determined as a data electrode.</p>
    <p num="5">
      As a typical line successive selection method, APT (Alt-Pleshko Technique) or IAPT (Improved APT) has been known.
      <br/>
      This technique is desirable for a multiplex driving method because ON-OFF levels can easily be produced.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Further, in the line successive selection method, scanning signals are successively supplied to scanning electrodes; data signals are supplied to data electrodes, and potential differences between the scanning signals and the data signals are applied to pixels.
      <br/>
      In this case, some driving methods are employable so as not to cause a change of the effective voltage applied to a certain pixel due to another pixel which undergoes an ON display or an OFF display.
      <br/>
      One of the driving methods is called a voltage averaging method which is the basic method for driving an effective value responsive type liquid crystal display device.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Description will be made on the driving method for a liquid crystal display device with reference to FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows a basic waveform used for driving a passive addressing type liquid crystal display device, which is an example of the line successive selection method using the voltage averaging method wherein a scanning signal voltage is expressed by Vr, a data signal voltage is expressed by Vc and the number of scanning electrodes is expressed by N. In the sequence for driving pixel signals, there are a selection type and a non-selection time wherein a voltage applied to a pixel in the selection time is (Vr +Vc) at the time of an ON display and the voltage is (Vr -Vc) at the time of an OFF display.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In the liquid crystal display device, there appears a change of orientation of liquid crystal molecule depending on a voltage to be applied.
      <br/>
      Since the change of orientation causes an optical change, the voltage difference between an effective voltage in an ON display and an effective voltage in an OFF display should be large as possible.
      <br/>
      When the scanning signal voltage is expressed by Vr, the data signal voltage is expressed by Vc and the number of scanning electrodes is expressed by N, the effective voltage in an ON display and the effective voltage in an OFF display can be expressed by the following Formulas 1A and 1B.

      If a liquid crystal display device for a monochrome display is used and the liquid crystal is completely responsive to the effective value, the contrast ratio can be increased by increasing the ON-OFF ratio.
      <br/>
      However, when a fast responsive type liquid crystal is used wherein the sum of response time at a rising time and a falling time is about 200 ms or less, there is a change of orientation in a short time and accordingly, the contrast ratio decreases.
      <br/>
      Such phenomenon is called a frame response.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The frame response phenomenon appears remarkably as the voltage difference of pixel signals between the selection time and the non-selection time is larger.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it has been known to control the frame response by lowering a bias value from the optimum bias value.
      <br/>
      However, the lowering of the bias value from the optimum bias value results in the reduction of the ON-OFF ratio, which reduces the contrast ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Further, it has been known to increase the frame frequency in order to control the frame response.
      <br/>
      However, this technique had a drawback to increase the power consumption rate.
      <br/>
      Further, it has been known to use a multiple line addressing method (MLA method) to control the frame response.
      <br/>
      However, this method requires driving ICs for exclusive use.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Further, there has been known a color liquid crystal display device utilizing the mutual interference of the birefringence in each of the liquid crystal layer and the birefringent plate.
      <br/>
      For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication JP-A-8-292434 proposes a super-reflective color liquid crystal display device (hereinbelow, referred to as SRC-LCD including a transmission mode) in detail, which provides an achromatic (white) display in a state of the driving voltage being OFF; facilitates use of multiplex driving, and effects a multicolor display.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In order to provide a color display of three colors or more by the SRC-LCD, it is necessary to apply an intermediate voltage.
      <br/>
      In this case, it has been known that the color purity in employing the multiplex driving is decreased in comparison with a change of color to a change of voltage in a case of using a static driving method.
      <br/>
      This is a phenomenon different from the case caused by the reduction of the contrast ratio in a conventional monochrome display.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Further, the sum of response time at the rising and falling in a SRC mode was about 400 ms, and it was thought that the influence of the frame response due to a fast responsive property of the liquid crystal, which was often seen in the conventional monochrome display type STN-LCD, was small.</p>
    <p num="20">
      In order to drive a STN-LCD, the optimum bias is generally used because the highest ON-OFF ratio can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Generally, a monochrome STN-LCD is driven under such condition.
      <br/>
      The optimum bias is defined as (N0.5 +1).
      <br/>
      For instance, the optimum bias value in using 64 lines is 9.
      <br/>
      SRC-LCD (portable calculator) operable by such driving method has already been known.
      <br/>
      Further, there has been known SRC-LCD with 240 lines which provides a VGA display under the driving condition of a bias ratio of 16 (the optimum bias ratio=16.5).
    </p>
    <p num="21">In the following, a conventional technique in which the bias ratio is changed will be described.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Digest of technical papers for SID 1991 describes in P.747-P.750 that when a fast response type STN liquid crystal device is used for multiplex driving, the frame response is large and the bias value should be smaller than the optimum bias in order to increase the contrast ratio.
      <br/>
      Specifically, when a liquid crystal device having a liquid crystal layer gap of 5  MU m,  DELTA nd of 0.66  MU m and a response time of 75 ms and when it is driven under conditions of a frame frequency of 70 Hz and a duty ratio of 1/200, the optimum bias ratio shows 1/15.14. However, the SID1991 describes that use of the optimum bias of about 1/10 is better in order to increase the contrast ratio.
      <br/>
      Thus, the prior art document proposes to reduce the bias value in order to prevent the reduction of the contrast ratio and so on in a case of using the fast response type liquid crystal.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      On the other hand, the present invention is to prevent the color purity from deteriorating due to a strong influence by the frame response because  DELTA nd of the liquid crystal layer is large.
      <br/>
      For this, the bias value is determined to be smaller.
      <br/>
      Such tendency is obtainable even when the response time of liquid crystal is long (The average response time ( TAU ON= TAU OFF) of the liquid crystal used for the present invention is about 200 ms).

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="42">The color liquid crystal display device of the present invention will be described in more detail.</p>
    <p num="43">
      In a case of SRC-LCD in which birefringence is directly utilized to effect color development without using any color filter, the purity of color provided by a multiplex driving is decreased in comparison with the purity of color developed by a static driving.
      <br/>
      The cause of the phenomenon can be considered as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In SRC-LCD,  DELTA n1 * d1 of the liquid crystal is 1.2  MU m or more, which is determined to be greater than a value of about 0.8  MU m in a conventional monochrome display.
      <br/>
      When a desired value of  DELTA n * d is to be obtained, either  DELTA n or the gap d is increased.
      <br/>
      However, when  DELTA n of the liquid crystal is increased, the response speed becomes slow because the viscosity of material for the liquid crystal is generally increased.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      On the other hand, when the gap is increased, the response speed becomes slow in proportion to the square of the dimension of the gap.
      <br/>
      Thus, the sum of the response time at a rising time and a falling time in SRC-LCD becomes longer than the response time of the ordinary monochrome display.
      <br/>
      At present, the sum of the response time of SRC-LCD is about 400-500 ms.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Accordingly, it can not be considered that the frame response in using a quick response type liquid crystal occurs in the same manner as seen in a conventional monochrome display type STN-LCD.
      <br/>
      The inventor of this application consider the above-mentioned phenomenon as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      In SRC-LCD,  DELTA n1 * d1 of the liquid crystal used is 1.2 or more.
      <br/>
      Even though the rate of change of the liquid crystal due to the frame response is the same,  DELTA n1 d1 in SRC-LCD is large, and accordingly, it is supposed that the optical change is relatively large.
      <br/>
      Although any problem has not been caused on the frame response in the conventional monochrome display type STN-LCD, there results a big problem in SRC-LCD.
      <br/>
      Unlike the conventional monochrome display, the optical change due to the frame response is observed as mixed colors in SRC-LCD.
      <br/>
      Namely, the reduction of color purity is caused by the frame response.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In the present invention, it is essential that the bias value is determined to be at least 2 points lower than the optimum value.
      <br/>
      With such determination, the effect of suppressing the frame response is reduced.
      <br/>
      Further, when the bias value is reduced too much, the ON-OFF ratio is decreased whereby color development becomes insufficient and there is an adverse effect.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the condition as specified in the following Formula 4 should be satisfied.
    </p>
    <p num="49">PN 5 &lt;= BR &lt;= PN -2  Formula 4</p>

      In the above-mentioned description, an example using a liquid crystal layer having a left helical structure is described.
      <br/>
      However, even by using a liquid crystal layer having the opposite helical structure, a desired color display can easily be obtained in the same manner as the liquid crystal layer of the left helical structure by changing the.relations of angles  THETA 1,  THETA 2 and  THETA 3 among the directions of the long axis of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer, the directions of the polarizing axis of the polarizers and the direction of the slow axis of the birefringent plate to a counter clockwise direction.

      Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to Examples.

    <p num="56">
      A liquid crystal cell was prepared in the manner as follows.
      <br/>
      An ITO transparent electrode was formed on each glass substrate by patterning in a stripe form; an insulating film was formed on the electrode and an overcoat layer of polyimide was formed on the insulating film, followed by rubbing to form an orientation controlling film.
      <br/>
      Thus, each substrate was prepared.
      <br/>
      Two substrates were overlaid and a sealing material was applied to the periphery of the overlaid substrates to form a liquid crystal cell.
      <br/>
      A nematic liquid crystal having a positive dielectric anisotropy was filled in the liquid crystal cell, and the injection hole is closed with a sealing material.
    </p>
    <p num="57">The refractive index anisotropy  DELTA n1 of the liquid crystal and the thickness d1 of the liquid crystal layer were so adjusted that  DELTA n1 * d1 of the liquid crystal layer was 1.27  MU m. Further, determination was so made that  DELTA n 2 * d2 of the birefringent plate was 1.40  MU m, the twist angle of the liquid crystal layer was 240 (degree) ,  THETA 1 =125  (degree) ,  THETA 2 =80 (degree)  and  THETA 3 =140  (degree) .</p>
    <p num="58">
      The physical value of the liquid crystal  DELTA n=0.196 (25 (degree)  C.), Tc=99 (degree)  C., the dielectric anisotropy=15 (25 (degree)  C.), the viscosity=24 cSt (20 (degree) C.) were respectively determined.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the glass substrate used was 0.4 mm. The liquid crystal cell having the same arrangement as shown in FIG. 1 was formed, and measurement of a color display on the color liquid crystal cell was conducted by changing the bias value.

      Table 1 shows a result obtained by driving the device to effect a four gradation display by using a 1/65 duty wherein 4 levels of gradation were 0%, 41%, 65% and 100%.
      <br/>
      Each of the gradation levels corresponds to color development of white, orange, blue and green.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 is a chromaticity diagram obtained by measuring with bias values of 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The measurement was conducted by using the measuring system as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      In the measurement, light having a high directivity is introduced to a sample of SRC-LCD at an inclination angle of 10 (degree) , and the reflected light was measured from a vertical direction to the sample.
    </p>
    <p num="61">Evaluation was so made that the light was standardized with a standard white board so as to cancel the color of a light source, i.e., the light was treated as being emitted from a C-light source.</p>
    <p num="62">
      A halogen bulb (LA-150SAE, manufactured by Hayashi Watch Co., Ltd.) was used as the light source.
      <br/>
      Light from the light source was introduced by means of optical fibers so as to irradiate through a lens an optical beam to SRC-LCD.
      <br/>
      The light beam was modulated in SRC-LCD to develop each color.
      <br/>
      The reflected light of each of the developed colors was measured with a spectroradiometer (CS-1000, Minolta Camera Co., Ltd.).
      <br/>
      Data obtained by the measurement were operated by using a personal computer.
      <br/>
      The distance between SRC-LCD and the spectroradiometer (light incident point) was determined to be about 500 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      In Table 1, chromaticity coordinates of white, orange, blue and green obtained by applying various bias ratios are shown.
      <br/>
      The color purity of an orange color, a blue color or a green color becomes better as the bias value is made smaller.
      <br/>
      Namely, a bias value of 4 is the best.
      <br/>
      It is understood, however, that the color development of white is shifted to an yellow side when bias value is 4.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a bias value of 5 is better in order to obtain well-balanced color development of white, orange, blue and green.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      Optimized bias value at a 1/65 duty is about 9.
      <br/>
      It is understood that the bias value which provides the optimum balance in color purity at 1/65 duty in this Example is 5, which is smaller than the above-mentioned optimum bias of 4.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 6 and Table 1, it was possible to provide a display having a higher color purity as the bias value becomes lower concerning the colors except for white.

    <p num="66">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="67">
      A liquid crystal cell was prepared in the same manner as Example 1.
      <br/>
      Driving for a four gradation display was conducted by a 1/55 duty wherein the levels of gradation were 0%, 41%, 65% and 100%.
      <br/>
      The levels of gradation correspond to the development of colors of white, orange, blue and green.
      <br/>
      Generally, the optimum bias value at a 1/55 duty is about 8.5. In this Example, however, the bias value which provided the optimum balance of color purity was 5, which was 3.5 lower than the optimum bias value.
    </p>
    <p num="68">In accordance with the present invention, when a color liquid crystal display device utilizing birefringence, such as SRC-LCD is subjected to multiplex driving, it has been found that the reduction of color purity caused by the occurrence of mixed colors can be prevented.</p>
    <p num="69">
      Further, since the scanning signal voltage could be lowered by lowering the bias value, dielectric strength of a driver circuit could be reduced.
      <br/>
      Further, the lowering of the scanning signal voltage was advantageous in saving the consumption of power.
      <br/>
      Further, it has been found that use of a portable information terminal wherein a usable temperature is high or use of liquid crystal of low viscosity is in particular effective since the frame response is remarkable when there is a large change of the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      As described above, the color liquid crystal display device of the present invention provides an excellent effect such as a low power consumption rate, and is effective when it is used in a high temperature region.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the color liquid crystal display device of the present invention is used for a portable electronic device such as a portable telephone, an electronic note, an electronic book, an electronic dictionary, a PDA (a portable data accessing terminal), a pager (a pocket bell), which are all for outdoor use, it provides a high visibility due to its excellent characteristics of display.
      <br/>
      The present invention can be applied to various purposes of use as far as the effect of the present invention is not reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings.
      <br/>
      It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.
