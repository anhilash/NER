    <p num="1">This application is a 371 of PCT/GB97/03203 filed Nov. 21, 1997 now WO 98/22479 May 28, 1998.</p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to certain amide derivatives of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), particularly amide derivatives their uses particularly in preventing ischemic damage to cells, and a method of synthesis for certain amide derivatives and for PEP.</p>
    <p num="3">
      An ischaemic insult results when the blood flow to an organ of the body is insufficient relative to local needs, such that the resulting oxygen supply is greatly reduced.
      <br/>
      This can result in ischemic damage to the cells and, if the ischaemia is prolonged, to the eventual death of the organ.
      <br/>
      Ischemia is usually the result of a disease of the blood vessels, such as the arteries supplying the heart, but is also induced during cardiac surgery, involving coronary artery bypass grafting or valve replacements and also transplant operations, typically heart transplants.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is a glycolytic substrate which combines with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to form pyruvate and adenosine-5'-triphosphate acid (ATP), catalysed by the enzyme pyruvate kinase.
      <br/>
      It is an exergonic reaction which is irreversible under intracellular conditions, requiring Mg++ as a cofactor and an alkali-metal cation (e.g. K+) as a physiological activator.
      <br/>
      The enzyme is activated by increases in glycolytic intermediates such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate or PEP, or by low ATP concentrations, and is inhibited by high ATP concentrations or when aerobic metabolites such as fatty acids or acetyl CoA are available.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      WO83/02391 relates to a pharmaceutical composition for parental administration for preventing and treating ischemic cell damage which comprises a water soluble salt of PEP and a water soluble salt of ATP.
      <br/>
      Areas of application for the PEP/ATP composition are given as a perfusion and preservation solution for use in open heart surgery and other organ transplants, and for treating ischemic brain and heart damage as a result of heart failure, drowning or drug overdose.

      In these papers it is reported that the combination of PEP and ATP in a cardioplegic solution provides better post-ischemic recovery of function (in rat hearts) than PEP alone, but is no better than ATP alone.
      <br/>
      In J. Reconstructive Microsurgery Vol. 11, no. 6 (November 1995) a PEP/ATP infusion was found to reduce ischemia--repurfusion injury in rabbit skeletal muscle.
      <br/>
      In another investigation (British J. Plastic Surgery; 42; 675-681 (1989)) it was found that a composition of PEP and ATP or the free radical scavenger SOD, may be useful in the clinical treatment of failing ischemic skin flaps.

    <p num="7">
      PEP has also been suggested to have applications in other areas.
      <br/>
      Thus, it may be useful in the treatment of physical or mental fatigue (FR-A-3246) in circulatory insufficiencies, as an anticalculus agent (U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,675), as a cosmetic agent in skin preparations, as an anti-tumour agent, and as an agent to enhance the viability of stored blood (EP-A-275198).

      It is particularly surprising that the cyano group in formula 4 can be hydrolysed to the amide group.

    <p num="103">Recovery of Heart Function</p>
    <p num="104">The cardioplegic solution of Example 12 was compared (as discussed below) against a cardioplegic solution of the monopotassium salt of PEP (PEP-K) in the post-ischemic recovery of rat heart function.</p>
    <p num="105">
      An isolated working rat heart preparation was used.
      <br/>
      This is a left heart preparation which allows indices of cardiac function to be measured (aortic flow, coronary flow, heart rate, aortic systolic and diastolic pressure) and additional indices to be derived (cardiac output, stroke volume, stroke work).
      <br/>
      Using this preparation it is possible to simulate cardiopulmonary bypass, incorporating cardioplegic arrest and supportive bypass after ischaemia.
      <br/>
      The hearts were perfused with Krebs Henseleit buffer (KHB), as prepared in Example 12, containing 95% O2 :5% CO2.
      <br/>
      The hearts were originally perfused in the Langendorff mode for 5 min equilibration and then converted to the working mode for 10 min when measurement of aerobic control function could be made.
      <br/>
      The hearts were then reconverted to the Langendorff mode for a further 5 min and perfused with either normal KHB or KHB to which the compound of formula 3 (example 1) had been added; they were then converted back to the working mode (again containing either control KHB or KHB plus PEP-amide) for measurement of a second period of control function.
      <br/>
      The hearts were then arrested with the cardioplegic solution as prepared in Example 12, and subjected to 30 min normotheric global ischaemia and then reperfused with either control KHB or KHB containing the compound of formula 3 in the Langendorff mode for 15 min (simulating supportive bypass).
      <br/>
      The hearts were then converted to the reperfusate working mode (with reperfusate of either KHB or KHB plus compound formula 3) and post-ischaemic function was measured and expressed as a percent of the pre-ischaemic control function.
      <br/>
      Finally, the hearts were again converted back to the Langendorff mode for 5 min and then back again to the working mode for a further 15 min when post-ischaemic function was again measured.
      <br/>
      In this final period hearts were only reperfused with KHB.
    </p>
    <p num="106">Three groups were studied:</p>
    <p num="107">
      1.
      <br/>
      Hearts were perfused with KHB or normal cardioplegic solution.
      <br/>
      2. 100  MU mol/L compound formula 3 added to KHB as pretreatment, and to the cardioplegic solution and during initial Langendorff and working mode reperfusion period.
      <br/>
      3. 100  MU mol/L compound formula 3 added to KHB as pretreatment, and to the cardioplegic solution and during initial Langendorff and working mode reperfusion period.
    </p>
    <p num="108">Recovery of Function</p>
    <p num="109">
      In control hearts the recovery of aortic flow was 23.5 +- 3.5% and compound formula 3 improved recovery to 69.3 +- 4.3%. The heart properties measured for each of the three groups are shown in the accompanying Figures in which Figures 1 to 8 respectively show aortic flow, coronary flow, cardiac output, heart rate, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, stroke volume, and stroke work.
      <br/>
      Figures 9 and 10 shows the duration of reperfusion against the recovery of aortic flow at 10 minutes and 20 minutes respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      Thus the compound of formula 3, when used as a pretreatment, and/or as an additive to cardioplegic solution and/or as an additive to the reperfusate, significantly enhanced post-ischemic recovery of function when used at a dose of 100  MU mol/L.
      <br/>
      In addition the compound of formula 3 also significantly increased (by approximately 25%) post-ischemic recovery of function over PEP-K.
    </p>
    <p num="111">EXAMPLE 14</p>
    <p num="112">Recovery of Function</p>
    <p num="113">
      The compound of formula 3 ("compound 3") and its monopotassium salt (K-compound 3) were tested against the following cardioplegic solutions: Langendorff perfusion (control), phosphocreatine (PCr)--the standard/commercially available treatment, and the monopotassium salt of PEP(PEP-k).
      <br/>
      The recovery profile during working reperfusion is shown in Figure 11.
      <br/>
      More particularly Figure 11 shows the recovery profile of aortic flow in control hearts, or hearts treated with 100  MU mol/L compound 3, PEP-K, K-compound 3 or 10  MU mol/L phosphocreatine (PCr).
      <br/>
      Langendorff (L) perfusion is shown by the light shaded bars.
      <br/>
      Results are expressed as a percentage of the mean of the second working period, normalised to 100%.
      <br/>
      Values are mean (SEM have been omitted for greater clarity).
      <br/>
      Figure 12 show the percent recovery, after 50 min reperfusion of control hearts and hearts treated with 100  MU mol/L compound 3, PEP-K, K-compound 3, 10  MU mol/L phosphocreatine (PCr).
      <br/>
      Values are mean +- SEM; *p&lt;0.05.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      It can be seen that control hearts, and hearts from compound 3, and K-compound 3 treated groups recover rapidly, reaching a plateau by 10 min of the initial reperfusion period (when, in any of the drug-treated groups, drug would still be present, implying that the drug was not interfering with the rate of recovery of the hearts).
      <br/>
      These groups of hearts did not improve or deteriorate when the reperfusate was replaced during the second working reperfusion period with KH buffer alone (suggesting that the drug was not interfering with the extent of recovery).
      <br/>
      This high speed or recovery could be very important in salvaging critical tissue such as of the heart or brain.
      <br/>
      In contrast, hearts treated with 10  MU mol/L PCr recovered slowly and continued to recover throughout the 15 min initial working reperfusion period.
      <br/>
      These hearts continued to recover when reperfused with KH alone and this recovery did not plateau until the final 10 min of reperfusion.
      <br/>
      In a clinical situation the optimal administration regime for compound 3 and K-compound 3 may require administration during reperfusion as well as during ischaemia.
      <br/>
      Figure 12 shows the final recovery (at the end of the 50 min total reperfusion period) for all groups.
      <br/>
      It is clear that the recovery of hearts treated with compound 3 was significantly (p&lt;0.05) greater than control hearts, and was also greater than the other drug treated groups. K-compound 3, although not as good as compound 3, nevertheless aided recovery to a higher level than the control group.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      This study confirms that compound 3 and K-compound 3 as an additive to the pre-ischemic perfusate, to the cardioplegic solution and to the initial reperfusate (also at a dose of 100  MU mol/L), significantly improved post-ischemic recovery of function in rate hearts subjected to normothermic global ischemia.
      <br/>
      In addition, it shows that there was a tendency for hearts treated with compound 3 to recover better than hearts treated with PEP or phosphocreatine.
      <br/>
      This is even so under hypothermic conditions.
      <br/>
      Both compound 3 and K-compound 3 also aided a much faster rate of recovery of the hear in the first 10 minutes after administration (Figure 1) than phosphocreatine which may be very important in aiding recovery of function of critical tissue, such as of the heart and brain.
