    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">1 Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to an optical fiber array module, and more particularly, to a method of making an accurate optical fiber array by arraying and fixing single-core and multi-core optical fibers to make it easy to connect an optical waveguide device to the single-core and multi-core optical fibers, and a fiber array module.</p>
    <p num="4">5 Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Accurate arrangement of optical fibers is very important for attaching the optical fibers to an optical waveguide device.
      <br/>
      In the case of the optical waveguide device, the waveguides can be very accurately spaced and arrayed by photolithography.
      <br/>
      However, it is difficult to accurately arrange single-core and multi-core optical fibers which are attached to this waveguide.
      <br/>
      In existing methods, the optical fibers are arranged by forming grooves in a plane substrate such as a silicon wafer or a metal plate and fixing the optical fibers in the grooves.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      However, an accurate process is required to form a device for fixing the optical fibers using the grooves.
      <br/>
      Also, when the ends of the optical fibers are polished after the optical fibers are loaded, careful attention is needed because the optical fibers are thin.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since the thin optical fibers have a small surface area, they have only a small contact surface when attached to the waveguide device, leading to a weak attachment.
      <br/>
      These problems deteriorate the overall performance of the waveguide device when the optical waveguide device is packaged.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention roughly involves providing a device for fixing optical fibers, and arraying optical fibers and fixing them to the device, thereby constituting an accurate optical fiber array module.
      <br/>
      The fiber array module according to the present invention includes, as shown in FIG. 7A, a metal substrate 150 having plated holes, a metal-coated fiber array 180, and a fixing unit 190 for fixing the metal substrate 150 to the fiber array 180 whose fibers are inserted into the holes of the metal substrate 150.
      <br/>
      The metal substrate 150 has holes 160 into which optical fibers can be inserted, at predetennined intervals, and the walls of the holes 160 and the entire surface of the metal substrate 150 are plated with a metal material.
      <br/>
      A metal layer is deposited on a cladding layer or an external glass layer, exposed by peeling off a first coating, of the fibers of the fiber array 180, which are inserted into the holes 160 formed through the metal substrate 150 plated with metal.
      <br/>
      The fixing unit 190 fixes the fiber array 180 to the metal substrate 150 with molding compounds, when the optical fibers are arrayed by being inserted into the holes of the metal substrate 150 and heated.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      A method of manufacturing the fiber array module will now be described in detail.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, a plane substrate such as a flat silicon wafer, a ceramic board or a metal plate is prepared.
      <br/>
      Holes are formed at regular intervals in the plane substrate, to array optical fibers.
      <br/>
      The holes are accurately formed in the substrate by mechanical processing, a laser, a semiconductor exposure and etching process, or a dry etch method using a solution or reactive gas.
      <br/>
      The holes formed through the substrate are rectangular, circular or polygonal.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1A and 1B show holes for arraying optical fibers, formed in a substrate, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, wherein FIG. 1A shows the cross-section of the substrate and FIG. 1B is a plan view.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 150 is a substrate, and reference numeral 160 is a hole.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Meanwhile, when the substrate is the silicon wafer or ceramic sheet, a chrome/gold (Cr/Au) metal layer is vacuum-deposited on the walls of the holes and the entire surface of the substrate, to allow the substrate to be plated with solder alloy.
      <br/>
      When the substrate is a metal plate, such a metal layer is not necessary, and the surface of the substrate needs only to be processed to allow the solder alloy to be effectively attached to the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      After this process, the holes and the entire surface of the substrate are plated with the solder alloy by electrolytic plating or electroless plating.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2A and 2B are respectively a cross-sectional view and a plan view of the device of FIG. 1A whose surface and holes are plated with a solder material, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 170 denotes the solder material with which the substrate 150 is plated.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The optical fibers used in the present invention are formed by peeling all coatings off optical fibers and depositing a metal layer such as chrome/gold (Cr/Au), titanium/gold (Ti/Au) or titanium nitride/gold (TiN/Au) on cladding layers of the optical fibers.
      <br/>
      Also, the optical fibers can be copper coated.
      <br/>
      Optical fibers to be inserted into the holes in the substrate can be single-core, multi-core and ribbon optical fibers.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 3A and 3B are cross-sectional views of a metal coated fiber and a copper coated fiber, respectively, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 100 is a core, reference numeral 110 is a cladding layer, reference numerals 120 and 130 are first and second metal layers, and reference numeral 140 is a copper layer.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      When the optical fibers are prepared, each having a metal layer such as a Cr/Au, Ti/Au or TiN/Au layer, or a copper coating, the optical fibers are inserted into the holes 160 in the substrate 150 plated with solder alloy 170.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, when the solder alloy material is heated to its melting point or higher, the optical fibers move to the centers of the holes 160 by the surface tension of the solder alloy material.
      <br/>
      That is, the optical fibers are placed at the center of the holes 160 of the substrate 150 due to a self-alignment effect.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows a plated arranging substrate 150 according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention in which metal or copper coated optical fibers are inserted through holes 160 and the solder material is heated to reflow.
      <br/>
      Here, reference numeral 180 is the optical fiber coated with metal.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 5A and 5B show nonreflowing and reflowing solder materials in the hole 160, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The holes in the fiber arranging substrate can be perpendicular to the surface of the arranging substrate.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, they can be angled by 0.1 (degree)  to 20 (degree)  to reduce reflection loss or the like occurring, when connecting to an optical waveguide device.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Next, the resultant structure is solidly fixed by epoxy which is cured by heat or ultraviolet rays, and the ends of the optical fibers protruding through the holes 160 are polished to have optical luminance, thereby fabricating a fiber array module capable of being accurately attached to the optical waveguide device.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows the fiber arranging device according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, and optical fibers, which are sealed by molding compounds 190.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 7A and 7B are a plan view and a cross-sectional view of the fiber array of FIG. 6 after the ends of the arrayed fibers are polished to give optical illuminance.
    </p>
    <p num="21">When the multi-core fiber array formed using the structure of the present invention is attached to the optical waveguide device, the area of attached section is enlarged, thus improving is environmental characteristics and reliability of a device package upon the connection of the optical fibers.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Also, the fiber array module is simply manufactured, and the ends of loaded optical fibers are easily polished.
      <br/>
      A cheap connection module can be fabricated by the simple manufacturing process.
      <br/>
      The optical fibers are accurately arrayed by self-alignment using the surface tension of the solder material.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Furthermore, since the holes into which the optical fibers are inserted are angled at 0 (degree)  to 20 (degree)  with respect to the surface of the substrate, the reflection loss can be reduced when the arrayed optical fibers are connected to the optical waveguide device.</p>
    <p num="24">It should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiment disclosed herein as the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention, but rather that the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described in this specification except as defined in the appended claims.</p>
