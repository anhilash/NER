      Preferably, the spring material is sewn within the web of shade material.
      <br/>
      A plurality of pivots rotatably link adjacent shades together such that the plurality of shades has a fully extended longitudinal position or mode and a compact stacked position or mode wherein respective continuous loop springs are substantially vertically aligned in the stacked position.
      <br/>
      In the stacked position, the plurality of shades may be twisted and folded to form a sub-compact, twisted and folded position or mode.
      <br/>
      In the sub-compact mode, the entire shade can be placed in a bag or can be wrapped with an elastic strap to maintain the sub-compact positional mode.
      <br/>
      Additional features include longitudinally extending web material at the end shades, systems for attaching laterally facing edges of adjacent shades when those shades are in the fully extended longitudinal position or mode, and a pivot support plate in each shade in order to provide a substantially planar web of shade material.
      <br/>
      To enhance the utility of the automobile shade, the front side of the shade may carry either advertising indicia or emergency indicia (e.g., "Help", "Call Police," "Need Gas").
