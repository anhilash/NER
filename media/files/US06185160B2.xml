    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention relates to a wristwatch including a light emitting element.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that the main watch body is translucent.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the plurality of light emitting elements may be formed to have the shape of rings of different diameters and concentrically arranged on the surface of a light-transmissive face.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      FIG. 1 shows a wristwatch according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The wristwatch A is a quartz watch.
      <br/>
      A main watch body 1 is formed of a translucent synthetic resin such as polyethylene.
      <br/>
      A glass plate 2 is fit in a top surface of the main watch body 1.
      <br/>
      Below a face 3, a printed circuit board 4 and a known watch driving mechanism 5 are arranged.
      <br/>
      The wristwatch A is formed to be attachable to the arm by a belt 6.
      <br/>
      On one side surface of the main watch body 1, two operation buttons 8 and 9 are provided while interposing a stem 7 for time adjustment.
      <br/>
      One of the operation buttons 8 is formed of a push button, which is operable by pushing, and the other operation button 9 is formed of a pull button, which is operable by pulling.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the printed circuit board 4 has a first start switch 10, a second start switch 11, light emitting diodes 12, 13 and 14 as light emitting elements, a control circuit 15 for controlling the three light emitting diodes 12, 13 and 14 to flash sequentially for a prescribed time period, and a button cell 16 as a power source.
      <br/>
      The push button 8 is provided on the side surface of the main watch body 1 with a head portion thereof projecting so that it can be pushed and is constantly loaded by a spring so that the head portion projects outward.
      <br/>
      When the push button 8 is structured to cause a tip thereof to project into the main watch body 1 when being pushed against the spring, thereby turning on the first start switch 10 and inputting an ON signal "a" from the first start switch 10 to the control circuit 15 (see FIG. 3).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The pull button 9 is provided on the side surface of the main watch body 1 so that it can be pulled.
      <br/>
      The pull button 9 is structured to project by a prescribed distance when a head portion thereof is pulled outward and to remain in the operation state by a stabilizer 18.
      <br/>
      When the head portion of the pull button 9 is pulled, the pull button 9 is pulled out by a prescribed length and a tip thereof turns on the second start switch 11.
      <br/>
      A vibration sensor 17, for sensing vibrations and impacts, is connected in series to the second start switch 11.
      <br/>
      Thus, only when the second start switch 11 is on, the vibrations and impacts are detected and a detection signal "b" is input to the control circuit 15.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The control circuit includes a timer circuit, a driving circuit for controlling flashing of the light emitting diodes, and the like.
      <br/>
      When an ON signal "a" or a detection signal "b" is input, the light emitting diodes 12, 13 and 14 are sequentially caused to flash.
      <br/>
      When the timer circuit determines that a prescribed time period has passed, the flashing of the light emitting diodes 12, 13 and 14 is stopped.
      <br/>
      According to the wristwatch having the above described structure, when the push button 8 is pushed, the first start switch 10 starts.
      <br/>
      The ON signal "a" from the first start switch 10 is input to the control circuit 15.
      <br/>
      The control circuit 15 controls the light emitting diodes 12, 13 and 14, using the ON signal "a" as a trigger, to flash sequentially as shown in FIG. 4, so that the light appears to be moving around in the watch.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The states shown in FIGS. 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c) are repeated.
      <br/>
      When a prescribed time period passes, the control circuit 15 causes the light emitting diodes 12, 13 and 14 to stop emitting light and waits for the push button 8 to be pushed again.
      <br/>
      When the pull button 9 is pulled out, the second start switch 11 connected in series to the vibration sensor 17 is turned on.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the vibration sensor 17 becomes enabled.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the vibration sensor 17 detects vibrations or impacts applied to the wristwatch A, the detection signal b is input to the control circuit 15.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      When the detection signal "b" is input to the control circuit 15, the control circuit 15 controls the three light emitting diodes 12, 13 and 14, using the detection signal "b" as a trigger, to flash sequentially, so that the light appears to be moving around in the watch A. When a prescribed time period passes, the control circuit 15 causes the light emitting diodes 12, 13 and 14 to stop emitting light and waits for the vibration sensor 17 to detect vibrations or impacts again.
      <br/>
      While the pull button 9 is pulled out, the vibration sensor 17 is constantly in an enabled state and thus the light emitting diodes 12, 13 and 14 can be flashed by hand or body movement.
      <br/>
      Once the pull button 9 is pushed back, the second start switch 11 is turned off to open the circuit for the vibration sensor 17.
      <br/>
      Thus, the light emitting diodes 12, 13 and 14 cannot be flashed by hand or body movement.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The main watch body 1 is formed of a translucent resin.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the light emitting diodes 12, 13 and 14 flash, the emitted light is diffused in the resin.
      <br/>
      As a result, a large light spot appears to be moving inside the wristwatch.
      <br/>
      In this manner, even a small light spot can appear to be a large light spot.
      <br/>
      Thus, an amusing watch can be realized.
      <br/>
      The side surface of the main watch body may be covered with a cover member (not shown) formed of a translucent resin so that the light is diffused by the cover member.

      Next, a wristwatch including electro-luminescence elements 20, 21 and 22 concentrically formed on a rear surface of a light-transmissive face as shown in FIG. 5 will be described.
      <br/>
      The electro-luminescence elements 20, 21 and 22 are controlled by the control circuit 15 to flash sequentially from an outer one to an inner one or from an inner one to an outer one.

      When the push button 8 is pushed, the first start switch 10 is turned on.
      <br/>
      When the pull button 9 is pulled, the vibration sensor 17 for detecting vibrations and impacts applied to the wristwatch becomes enabled.
      <br/>
      The ON signal a from the first start switch 10 and the detection signal "b" from the vibration sensor 17 obtained when the second start switch 11 is on, are input to the control circuit 15.

      The control circuit 15 controls the three electro luminescence elements 20, 21 and 22, using the ON signal "a" as a trigger, to illuminate the face 3 from below and also to flash, so that rings of light appear to be expanding or contracting.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      Thus, when the vibration sensor 17 detects vibrations or impacts applied to the wristwatch, the detection signal "b" is input to the control circuit 15.

      When a prescribed time period passes, the control circuit 15 causes the electro luminescence elements 20, 21 and 22 to stop emitting light and waits for the vibration sensor 17 to detect vibrations or impacts again.
      <br/>
      While the pull button 9 is pulled out, the vibration sensor 17 is constantly in an enabled state and thus the electroluminescence elements 20, 21 and 22 can be caused to flash by hand or body movement.

      According to the invention, a plurality of light emitting elements provided inside the main watch body are caused to flash by pushing an operation button, thereby illuminating the face.

      The light emitting elements sequentially flash.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the wristwatch is both practical as well as entertaining.
      <br/>
      According to another embodiment of the invention, the operation of a built-in sensor for detecting vibrations or impacts can be controlled by an operation button.

      The wristwatch can also be enjoyed as a glowing object such as a pen light which can be caused to flash in accordance with the movement of the body.

      According to another embodiment of the invention, the main watch body diffuses the light from the light emitting elements, and thus the entire main watch body appears to emit light.
