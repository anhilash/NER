    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates generally to the field of microsurgery and more particularly to a control system for an ophthalmic surgery system.</p>
    <p num="2">
      The human eye in its simplest terms functions to provide vision by transmitting light through a clear outer portion called the cornea, and focusing the image by way of the lens onto the retina.
      <br/>
      The quality of the focused image depends on many factors including the size and shape of the eye, and the transparency of the cornea and lens.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      When age or disease causes the lens to become less transparent, vision deteriorates because of the diminished light which can be transmitted to the retina.
      <br/>
      This deficiency in the lens of the eye is medically known as a cataract.
      <br/>
      An accepted treatment for this condition is surgical removal of the lens and replacement of the lens function by an artificial intraocular lens (IOL).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In the United States, the majority of cataractous lenses are removed by a surgical technique called phacoemulsification.
      <br/>
      During this procedure, a thin phacoemulsification cutting tip is inserted into the diseased lens and vibrated ultrasonically.
      <br/>
      The vibrating cutting tip liquifies or emulsifies the lens so that the lens may be aspirated out of the eye.
      <br/>
      The diseased lens, once removed, is replaced by an artificial lens.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A typical ultrasonic surgical device suitable for ophthalmic procedures consists of an ultrasonically driven handpiece, an attached cutting tip, and irrigating sleeve and an electronic control console.
      <br/>
      The handpiece assembly is attached to the control console by an electric cable and flexible tubings.
      <br/>
      Through the electric cable, the console varies the power level transmitted by the handpiece to the attached cutting tip and the flexible tubings supply irrigation fluid to and draw aspiration fluid from the eye through the handpiece assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The operative part of the handpiece is a centrally located, hollow resonating bar or horn directly attached to a set of piezoelectric crystals.
      <br/>
      The crystals supply the required ultrasonic vibration needed to drive both the horn and the attached cutting tip during phacoemulsification and are controlled by the console.
      <br/>
      The crystal/horn assembly is suspended within the hollow body or shell of the handpiece by flexible mountings.
      <br/>
      The handpiece body terminates in a reduced diameter portion or nosecone at the body's distal end.
      <br/>
      The nosecone is externally threaded to accept the irrigation sleeve.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the horn bore is internally threaded at its distal end to receive the external threads of the cutting tip.
      <br/>
      The irrigation sleeve also has an internally threaded bore that is screwed onto the external threads of the nosecone.
      <br/>
      The cutting tip is adjusted so that the tip projects only a predetermined amount past the open end of the irrigating sleeve.
      <br/>
      Ultrasonic handpieces and cutting tips are more fully described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,589,363; 4,223,676; 4,246,902; 4,493,694; 4,515,583; 4,589,415; 4,609,368; 4,869,715; 4,922,902; 4,989,583; 5,154,694 and 5,359,996, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In use, the ends of the cutting tip and irrigating sleeve are inserted into a small incision of predetermined width in the cornea, sclera, or other location.
      <br/>
      The cutting tip is ultrasonically vibrated along its longitudinal axis within the irrigating sleeve by the crystal-driven ultrasonic horn, thereby emulsifying the selected tissue in situ.
      <br/>
      The hollow bore of the cutting tip communicates with the bore in the horn that in turn communicates with the aspiration line from the handpiece to the console.
      <br/>
      A reduced pressure or vacuum source in the console draws or aspirates the emulsified tissue from the eye through the open end of the cutting tip, the cutting tip and horn bores and the aspiration line and into a collection device.
      <br/>
      The aspiration of emulsified tissue is aided by a saline flushing solution or irrigant that is injected into the surgical site through the small annular gap between the inside surface of the irrigating sleeve and the cutting tip.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The preferred surgical technique is to make the incision into the anterior chamber of the eye as small as possible in order to reduce the risk of induced astigmatism.
      <br/>
      These small incisions result in a very tight wounds that squeeze the irrigating sleeve tightly against the vibrating tip.
      <br/>
      Friction between the irrigating sleeve and the vibrating tip generates heat, but the risk of the tip overheating and causing a burn to the tissue is reduces by the cooling effect of the aspirated fluid flowing inside the tip.
      <br/>
      When the tip becomes occluded with tissue, this aspiration flow can be reduced or eliminated, allowing the tip to heat up.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Prior art devices have used sensors that detect large rises in aspiration vacuum, and predict occlusions based on vacuum rise.
      <br/>
      Based on this sensed occlusion, power to the handpiece may be reduced and/or irrigation and aspiration flows can be increased.
      <br/>
      See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,591,127, 5,700,240 and 5,766,146 (Barwick, Jr., et al.), the entire contents of which being incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Increased vacuum levels in the aspiration line, however, do not necessarily indicate that the flow of cooling fluid around the tip has been cut off.
      <br/>
      Even with the tightest incisions, some irrigating fluid will leak out between the wound and the outside of the irrigating sleeve.
      <br/>
      The wound leakage also provides addition cooling flow to the incision site, and measuring rises in aspiration vacuum alone does not necessarily indicate that a potential for a corneal burn exists.
      <br/>
      Therefore, power to the handpiece may be interrupted prematurely.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Therefore, a need continues to exist for a control system for a surgical handpiece that utilizes a better indication of fluid flow at the tip for the control of ultrasonic power levels.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      The irrigation fluid flow data may be used by CPU 316 to control the operating parameters of console 314 using software commands that are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, CPU 316, through cable 350, may control pressurizing source 329 while reading pressure sensor 327 data through cable 356 so as to vary the pressure and amount of irrigation fluid reaching handpiece 312 from source 326.
      <br/>
      CPU 316 may also, through cable 340, vary the output of power supply 320 being sent to handpiece 312 through power cable 342.
      <br/>
      CPU 316 may also use data supplied by sensor 322 to vary the operation of pump 318 through cable 344, which aspirates fluid from handpiece 312 through line 346 and into collection container 328 through line 348.
      <br/>
      CPU 316 may also use data supplied by sensor 322 and the applied output of power supply 320 to provide audible tones to the user.

      As seen in FIG. 7, when the system of the present invention is monitoring infusion flow, the system monitors the current infusion flow and compares the actual flow against a predetermined flow rate.
      <br/>
      If infusion flow is above the predetermined rate, no action is taken by the system.
      <br/>
      If the infusion flow is below the predetermined rate, the system may take a variety of actions, such as changing the power delivered to the ultrasound handpiece, providing a variable tone to the surgeon or changing the aspiration pressure.
