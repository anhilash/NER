      This invention provides novel hippocampus-associated proteins and DNA sequences coding therefor.
      <br/>
      In an investigation of hippocampus-associated proteins by differential screening of a rat hippocampus cDNA library, a cDNA species encoding a novel protein designated Hct-1 was isolated and shown to be a to cytochromes P450.
      <br/>
      The use of hybridization probes based on the rat Hct-1 sequence has led to the identification of homologues in other mammalian species.

      This invention relates to novel hippocampus-associated proteins, to DNA sequences coding therefor, to uses thereof and to antibodies to said proteins.

      The novel hippocampus-associated proteins are believed to be of the cytochrome P450 class.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The identification of hippocampus-associated proteins and the isolation of cDNA molecules coding therefor is important in the field of neurophysiology.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, such proteins are believed to be associated with memory functions and abnormalities in these proteins, including abnormal levels of expression and the formation of modified or mutated protein is considered to be associated with pathological conditions associated with memory impairment.
      <br/>
      The isolation of novel hippocampus-associated proteins and the associated DNA sequences coding therefor is consequently of considerable importance.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The present invention arose out of our investigation of hippocampus-associated proteins by differential screening of a rat hippocampus cDNA library.
      <br/>
      A cDNA species encoding a novel protein which we have designated Hct-1 was isolated and shown to be related to cytochromes of the P450 class.
    </p>
    <p num="5">The use of hybridization probes based on the rat Hct-1 sequence has led to the identification of homologues in other mammalian species, specifically mouse and human.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Cytochromes P450 are a diverse group of heme-containing mono-oxygenases (termed CYP's; see Nelson et al., DNA Cell Biol. (1993) 12, 1-51) that catalyse a variety of oxidative conversions, notably of steroids but also of fatty acids and xenobiotics.
      <br/>
      While CYP's are most abundantly expressed in the testis, ovary, placenta, adrenal and liver, it is becoming clear that the brain is a further site of CYP expression.
      <br/>
      Several CYP activities or mRNA's have been reported in the nervous system but these are predominantly of types metabolizing fatty acids and xenobiotics (subclasses CYP2C, 2D, 2E and 4).
      <br/>
      However, primary rat brain-derived glial cells have the capacity to synthesize pregnenolone and progesterone in vitro.
      <br/>
      Mellon and Deschepper, Brain Res. (1993), 629, 283-292(9) provided molecular evidence for the presence, in brain, of key steroidogenic enzymes CYP11A1 (scc) and CYP11B1 (11  BETA ) but failed to detect CYP17 (c17) or CYP11B2 (AS).
      <br/>
      Although CYP21A1 (c21) activity is reported to be present in brain, authentic CYP21A1 transcripts were not detected in this tissue.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Interest in steroid metabolism in brain has been fuelled by the finding that adrenal- and brain-derived steroids (neurosteroids) can modulate cognitive function and synaptic plasticity.
      <br/>
      For instance, pregnenolone and steroids derived from it are reported to have memory enhancing effects in mice.
      <br/>
      However, the full spectrum of steroid metabolizing CYP's in brain and the biological roles of their metabolites in vivo has not been established.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      To investigate such regulation of brain function our studies have focused on the hippocampus, a brain region important in learning and memory.
      <br/>
      Patients with lesions that include the hippocampus display pronounced deficits in the acquisition of new explicit memories while material encoded long prior to lesion can still be accessed normally.
      <br/>
      In rat, neurotoxic lesions to the hippocampus lead to a pronounced inability to learn a spatial navigation task, such as the water maze.
      <br/>
      The role of the hippocampus in learning has been further emphasized by the finding that hippocampal synapses, notably those in region CA1, display a particularly robust form of activity-dependent plasticity known as long term potentiation (LTP).
      <br/>
      This phenomenon satisfies some of the requirements for a molecular mechanism underlying memory processes--persistence, synapse-specificity and associativity.
      <br/>
      LTP is thought to be initiated by calcium influx through the NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate) subclass of receptor activated by the excitatory neurotransmitter, L-glutamate, and occlusion of NMDA receptors in vivo with the competitive antagonist AP5 both blocks LTP and the acquisition of the spatial navigation task.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The induction of LTP is attenuated by simultaneous release of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) from inhibitory interneurons: activation of GABAA receptors antagonizes L-glutamate induced depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron and interplay between the GABA and L-glutamate receptor pathways is thought to modulate the establishment of LTP.
      <br/>
      Interplay between these two circuits is emphasised by the finding that some aesthetics (e.g. ketamine) act as antagonists of the NMDA receptor while others, such as the steroid aesthetic alfaxolone, are thought to be agonists of the GABAA receptor.
      <br/>
      It is of particular note that some naturally occurring steroids, such as pregnenolone sulfate, act as agonists of the GABAA receptor, while pregnenolone sulfate is also reported to increase NMDA currents.
      <br/>
      Although neurosteroids principally appear to exert their effects via the GABAA and NMDA receptors, there have been indications that neurosteroids may also interact with sigma and progesterone receptors.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Despite considerable interest in the action of neuro-active steroids, and possible roles in modulating synaptic plasticity and brain function, little is known of pathways of steroid metabolism in the central nervous system.
      <br/>
      As part of a study into the molecular biology of the hippocampal formation, and the mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, we have sought molecular clones corresponding to mRNA's expressed selectively in the formation.
      <br/>
      One such cDNA, Hct-1 (forhippocampal transcript), was isolated from a cDNA library prepared from adult rat hippocampus.
      <br/>
      Sequence analysis has revealed that Hct-1 is a novel cytochrome P450 most closely related to cholesterol- and steroid-metabolizing CYP's but, unlike other CYP's, is predominantly expressed in brain.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides molecular characterization of Hct-1 coding sequences from rat, mouse and humans, their expression patterns, and discusses the possible role of Hct-1 in steroid metabolism in the central nervous system.
    </p>
    <p num="11">DNA sequences encoding hitherto unknown cytochrome P450 proteins have now been identified and form one aspect of the present invention.</p>

      It will be appreciated that the DNA sequences that include introns (such as the sequences covered by definitions (e) to (j) above), may consist of or be derived from genomic DNA.

      Such sequences could be obtained by probing an appropriate library (cDNA or genomic) using hybridisation probes based upon the sequences provided according to the invention, or they could be prepared by chemical synthesis or by ligation of subsequences.

    <p num="33">Details of the isolation of hippocampus-associated DNA molecules according to the invention will now be described by way of example:</p>

      1.
      <br/>
      ISOLATION OF GENE ENCODING RAT HCT-1
    </p>
    <p num="35">1.1 Differential screening of a rat hippocampus cDNA library</p>
    <p num="36">
      To identify genes whose expression is enriched in the hippocampal formation we performed a differential hybridization screen of a hippocampal cDNA library.
      <br/>
      Adult rat hippocampal RNA was reverse transcribed using a oligo-dT-NotI primer, converted to double-stranded cDNA, EcoRI adaptors were attached and the cDNA's were inserted between the EcoRI and NotI sites of a bacteriophage lamda vector.
    </p>
    <p num="37">1.1.1 Preparation of cDNA libraries</p>
    <p num="38">
      Following anaesthesia (sodium pentobarbital) of adult rats (Lister hooded) the hippocampal formation was dissected, including areas CA1-3 and dentate gyrus, subiculum, alvear and fimbrial fibres but excluding fornix and afferent structures such as septum and entorhinal cortex.
      <br/>
      Remainder of brain was also pooled taking care to exclude hippocampal tissue.
      <br/>
      Total RNAs were prepared by a standard guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure, centrifugation through a CsCI cushion, and poly-A+ mRNA selected by affinity chromatography on oligo-dT cellulose.
      <br/>
      First strand cDNA synthesis used a NotI adaptor primer
      <br/>
      �5-dCAATTCGCGGCCGC(T)15 -3'�
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase; second strand synthesis was performed by RNaseH treatment, DNA polymerase I fill-in and ligase treatment.
      <br/>
      Following the addition of hemi-phosphorylated EcoRI adaptors (5'-dCGACAGCAACGG-3' and 5'-dAATTCCGTTGCTGTCG-3') and cleavage with NotI the cDNA was inserted between the NotI and EcoRI sites of bacteriophage lambda vector lambda-ZAPII (Stratagene).
    </p>
    <p num="40">1.1.2 Differential hybridization screening</p>
    <p num="41">
      Recombinant bacteriophage plaques were transferred in duplicate to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham), denatured (0.5M NaOH, 1.5M NaCl, 4 min), renatured (1M Tris.HCI pH 7.4, 1.5M NaCl), rinsed, dried and baked (2 h, 80 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      Hybridization as described (Church et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1984), 81 1991-1995) used a radiolabelled probe prepared by MMLV reverse transcriptase copying of polyA+ RNA (from either hippocampus or the remainder of brain) into cDNA in the presence of  ALPHA -32 P-dCTP and unlabeled dGTP, dATP and dTTP according to standard procedures.
      <br/>
      Following washing and exposure for autoradiography, differentially hybridizing plaques were repurified.
      <br/>
      Inserts were transferred to a pBluescript vector either by cleavage and ligation or by using in vivo excision using the ExAssist/SOLR system (Stratagene).
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Duplicate lifts from 500,000 plaques were screened with radiolabelled cDNA probes prepared by reverse transcription of RNA from either hippocampus (Hi) or `rest of brain` (RB).
      <br/>
      Approximately 360 clones gave a substantially stronger hybridization signal with the Hi probe than with the RB probe; 49 were analysed in more depth, In vivo excision was used to transfer the inserts to a plasmid vector for partial DNA sequence studies.
      <br/>
      Of these, 21 were novel (not presented here); others were known genes whose expression is enriched in hippocampus but not specific to the formation (eg., the rat amyloidogenic protein.
      <br/>
      Northern analysis was first performed using radiolabelled probes corresponding to the 21 novel sequences.
      <br/>
      While three (12.10a, 14.5a and 15.13a) identified transcripts specific to the hippocampus, 12.10a and 15.13a both hybridized to additional transcripts whose expression was not restricted to the formation.
      <br/>
      Clone 14.5a appeared to identify transcripts enriched in hippocampus and was dubbed Hct-1.
    </p>
    <p num="43">1.2 Characterisation of Rat Hct-1</p>
    <p num="44">1.2.1 Rat Hct-1 encodes a cyto chrome P450</p>
    <p num="45">
      To extend this characterization, the insert of clone 14.5a (300 nt) was used to rescreen the hippocampal cDNA library. 4 positives were identified (clones 14.5a-5, -7, -12 and -13), and the region adjacent to the poly-A tail analysed by DNA sequencing.
      <br/>
      While clones 5 (0.7 kb) and 12 (1.4 kb) had the same 3' end as the parental clone, clone 7 (0.9 kb) had a different 3' end consistent with utilization of an alternative polyadenylation site.
      <br/>
      Clone 13 (2.5 kb), however, appeared unrelated to Hct-1 and was dubbed Hct-2.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Clones 12 and 7 were then fully sequenced and the sequences obtained were compared with the database.
      <br/>
      Significant homology was detected between clone 12 and the human and rat cDNA's encoding cholesterol 7 ALPHA -hydroxylase, though the sequences are clearly distinct.
      <br/>
      At the nucleic acid level, the 1428 nt cDNA clone for rat Hct-1 shared 55% identity over an 1100 nt overlap with human cholesterol 7 ALPHA -hydroxylase (CYP7) and 54% identity over a 1117 nt overlap with rat CYP7.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 gives the partial cDNA sequences of rat Hct-1 and the encoded polypeptide.
    </p>
    <p num="47">1.2.2 Hct-1 mRNA expression in rat</p>
    <p num="48">
      Rat Hct-1 clone 14.5a/12 (1.4 kb) was used to investigate the expression of Hct-1 mRNA in rat brain and other organs.
      <br/>
      We first performed in situ hybridization to sections of rat brain.
      <br/>
      While these preliminary experiments did not permit unambiguous localization of Hct-1 transcripts, we confirmed expression in the hippocampus, predominantly in the cell layers of the dentate gyrus, while weaker expression was detected in other hippocampal and brain regions (not presented).
      <br/>
      Northern analysis was then performed on RNA prepared from different sections of rat brain.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2A the Hct-1 probe identifies three transcripts in hippocampus of 5.0, 2.1 and 1.8 kb, with the two smaller transcripts being particularly enriched in hippocampus.
      <br/>
      The larger transcript was only detectable in brain, while the two smaller transcripts were also present in liver (and, at much lower levels, in kidney) but not in other organs tested including adrenal (not shown), testis, and ovary.
      <br/>
      In brain, expression was also detected in olfactory bulb and cortex while very low levels were present in cerebellum (FIG. 2A).
    </p>
    <p num="49">1.2.3 Sexual dimorphism of Hct-1 expression in liver but not in brain</p>
    <p num="50">
      The expression of several CYPS is known to be sexually dimorphic in liver.
      <br/>
      We therefore inspected liver and brain of male and female rats for the presence of Hct-1 transcripts.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2B the Hct-1 probe revealed the 1.8 and 2.1 kb (and 5.0 kb, Hct-2) transcripts in both male and female brain, with the 2.1 kb Hct-1 transcript predominating.
      <br/>
      Levels of Hct-1 mRNA's in liver were reduced greater than 20-fold over those detected in brain.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, Hct-1 transcripts were only significant in liver from male animals; expression of Hct-1 in females was barely detectable demonstrating that hepatic expression of Hct-1 is sexually dimorphic.
    </p>
    <p num="51">2. ISOLATION OF MOUSE HCT-1</p>
    <p num="52">2.1 Isolation of mouse Hct-1 cDNA clones</p>
    <p num="53">
      A mouse liver cDNA library, established as NotI-EcoRI fragments in a lambda-gt10 vector, was probed using a rat Hct-1 probe.
      <br/>
      The library was a kind gift of B. Luckow and K. Kastner, Heidelberg.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Because the transcripts identified by the Hct-1 probe (predominantly 1.8 and 2.1 kb) are clearly longer than the longest cDNA clone (1.4 kb) obtained from our rat hippocampus library, we therefore elected to pursue studies with the mouse Hct-1 ortholog.
      <br/>
      A mouse liver cDNA library was screened using a rat Hct-1 probe and four clones were selected, none containing a poly-A tail.
      <br/>
      Two (clones 33 and 35, both 1.8 kb) gave identical DNA sequences at both their 5' and 3' ends, and this sequence was approximately 91% similar to rat Hct-1.
      <br/>
      The remaining two clones, 23 and 40, were also identical to each other and were related to the other clones except for a 5' extension in (59 nt) and a 3' deletion (99 nt).
      <br/>
      The complete DNA sequences of clones 35 and 40 were therefore determined.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The sequences obtained were identical throughout the region of overlap.
      <br/>
      The mouse Hct-1 open reading frame (ORF) commences with a methionine at nucleotide 81 (numbering from clone 40) and terminates with a TGA codon at nucleotide 1600, encoding a protein of 507 amino acids (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      At the 5' end it is of note that the ATG initiation codon leading the ORF does not correspond to the translation initiation consensus sequence YYAYYATGR.
      <br/>
      However, the 5' untranslated region cloned is devoid of other possible initiation codons and an in-frame termination triplet (TAA) lies 20 codons upstream of the ATG.
      <br/>
      The encoded polypeptide sequence aligns well with other cytochrome P450 sequences and we surmise that the ATG at position 81 represents the correct start site for translation.
      <br/>
      At the 3' end the truncation of clone 40 lies entirely in the non-coding region downstream of the stop codon.
      <br/>
      Neither clone contained a poly-A tail but both contained a potential polyadenylation sequence (AATAAA) at a position corresponding precisely to that seen in the rat cDNA.
    </p>
    <p num="56">2.2 Structure of mouse Hct-1 polypeptide</p>
    <p num="57">
      As anticipated, nucleotide sequence homology of mouse Hct-1 was highest with human cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase, with approximately 56% identity over the coding region.
      <br/>
      At the polypeptide level the mouse ORF shows 81% identity to the rat Hct-1 polypeptide over 414 amino acids; the precise degree of similarity may be different as the full protein sequence of rat Hct-1 is not known.
      <br/>
      Both the human (CYP7) and rat cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase polypeptides share 39% amino acid sequence identity to mouse Hct-1.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4A presents the alignment of mouse Hct-1 polypeptide with human CYP7.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The N-terminus of the Hct-1 polypeptide is hydrophobic, a feature shared by microsomal CYP's.
      <br/>
      This portion of the polypeptide is thought to insert into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, holding the main bulk of the protein on the cytoplasmic side.
      <br/>
      Consistent with microsomal CYP's, the N-terminus lacks basic amino acids prior to the hydrophobic core (amino acids 9-34).
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Several alignment studies have previously highlighted conserved regions within CYP polypeptides.
      <br/>
      We therefore inspected the Hct-1 sequence for these conserved regions.
      <br/>
      CYP's contain a highly conserved motif, FxxGxxxCxG(xxxA), present in 202 of the 205 compiled sequences (Nelson et al., supra), that is thought to represent the heme binding site.
      <br/>
      The arrangement of amino acids around the cysteine residue has been postulated to preserve the three-dimensional structure of this region for ligand binding.
      <br/>
      This motif is fully conserved in Hct-1 (FIG. 4B).
      <br/>
      A second conserved domain is also present in CYP's responsible for steroid interconversions.
      <br/>
      While this domain is largely conserved in Hct-1 an invariant Pro residue is replaced, in Hct-1, by Val (FIG. 4C); the rat Hct-1 polypeptide also contains a Val residue at this position.

    <p num="60">2.3 Expression pattern of mouse Hct-1</p>
    <p num="61">
      To verify enriched expression of Hct-1 in hippocampus we performed Northern and in situ hybridization analyses on mouse material.
      <br/>
      In contrast to the situation in rat, the 1.4 kb clone 12 detected only a 1.8 kb transcript; the 2.1 kb and 5.0 kb transcripts were absent from all tissues examined (FIG. 2C).
      <br/>
      The apparent absence of the 2.1 kb transcript may only reflect a lower abundance of this transcript because at least some mouse cDNA clones extend beyond the upstream polyadenylation site which is thought, in rat, to generate the shorter (1.8 kb) transcript.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      To refine this analysis, a 42-mer oligonucleotide was designed according to the DNA sequence of the 3' untranslated region of the cDNA clone upstream of the first polyadenylation site (materials and methods), so as to minimize cross-hybridization with other CYP mRNA's.
      <br/>
      Coronal sections of mouse brain were hybridized to the 35 S-labelled probe and, after emulsion dipping, exposed for autoradiography (FIG. 5).

      Transcripts were detected throughout mouse brain, with no evidence of restricted expression in the hippocampus (FIG. 5A,B).
      <br/>
      Strongest expression was observed in the corpus callosum, the anterior commisure and fornix while, as in rat, hippocampal expression was particularly prominent in the dentate gyrus (FIG. 5C).

      <br/>
      Under high stringency conditions the Hct-1 probe recognised a small number of bands within the mouse genomic digests, suggesting that Hct-1 is present in the mouse genome as a single copy gene.

    <p num="74">3.1 Conservation of Hct-1 in humans.</p>
    <p num="75">
      The evolutionary conservation of a gene supports a functionally significant role for that gene in the organism.
      <br/>
      The conservation of Hct-1 in rodents has been demonstrated by the cloning of the rat and mouse cDNAs for Hct-1.
      <br/>
      To establish the presence of the Hct-1 gene in the human genome, Southern blotting of human DNA was performed.
      <br/>
      The rat 1.4 kb clone of Hct-1 was used as a radiolabelled probe and gave strong signals from all three species (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      A number of hybridising fragments appear to be conserved between species, suggesting conservation of the Hct-1 gene structure.
      <br/>
      There is a conserved 1.4 kb HindIII band between mouse and rat, while human DNA contains a slightly larger HindIII band of 1.6 kb. Also an EcoRI fragment of 11 kb is conserved in human and rat Hct-1.
      <br/>
      Conservation of Hct-1 gene structure is also supported from the cDNA digestion patterns of mouse and rat (see FIGS. 6 and 7), where the SacI, HindIII and PstI sites are conserved between the rodent species.
    </p>
    <p num="76">3.2 A single gene for Hct-1 in mouse, rat and human</p>
    <p num="77">
      Because CYP's comprise a family of related enzymes we wished to determine whether close homologs of Hct-1 are present in the mammalian genome.
      <br/>
      The rat Hct-1 probe (1.4 kb) was used to probe a genomic Southern blot of rat, mouse and human DNA.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 6 the probe revealed a simple pattern of cross-hybridizing bands in all DNA's examined.
      <br/>
      In BamHI-cut human DNA only a single major cross-hybridizing band (4 kb) was detected (FIG. 6), while reprobing with the 300 nt. clone 14-5a yielded, in each lane, a single cross-hybridizing band (not shown).
      <br/>
      These data argue that a single conserved Hct-1 gene is present in mouse, rat and human, and that the mammalian genome does not contain very close homologs of Hct-1 that would be detected by cross-hybridization (&gt;70-80% homology).
    </p>
    <p num="78">3.3 Isolation of sequences encoding human Hct-1</p>
    <p num="79">
      The rat cDNA clone 14.5a-12 was used to probe a Southern blot of human genomic DNA digested with BamHI according to standard procedures.
      <br/>
      A single band at 3.8 kb was identified that cross-hybridises with the probe.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, 20  MU g of human genomic DNA was cleaved to completion with BamHI, resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the size range 3.4-4.2 kb selected by reference to markers run on the same gel.
      <br/>
      The gel fragment was digested by agarase treatment, DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and ligated into BamHI-cut bacteriophage lambda ZAP vector (Stratagene).
      <br/>
      Following packaging in vitro and plating on a lawn of E. coli strain XL1-Blue , plaque lifts of 100,000 clones were screened for hybridisation to the rat cDNA. 12 positive signals were identified and all contained a 3.8 kb insert.
      <br/>
      One was selected and the segment was partially sequenced, identifying two regions of high homology to the rat (and mouse) cDNA's and corresponding to exons 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9 presents the nucleotide sequence and FIG. 10 compares the human Hct-1 translation product with the cognate mouse polypeptide.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      To extend this characterisation, the 3.8 kb BamHI fragment obtained from the size-selected library was used to screen a genomic library of human DNA prepared by partial Sau3A cleavage and insertion of 14-18 kb fragments into a bacteriophage lambda vector according to standard techniques (gift of Dr. P. Estibeiro, CGR).
      <br/>
      Positive clones were obtained, and restriction mapping of one confirmed that it contains approximately 14 kb of human DNA encompassing the exons identified above and further regions of the Hct-1 gene; together the different aenomic clones are thought to encompass the entire Hct-1 gene.
      <br/>
      The human genomic sequence may be used to screen human cDNA libraries for full length cDNA clones; alternatively, following complete DNA sequence determination the human genomic sequence may be expressed in mammalian cells by adjoining it to a suitable promoter sequence and cDNA prepared from the correctly spliced mRNA product so produced.
      <br/>
      Finally, the genomic Hct-1 sequence would permit the entire coding sequence to be deduced so permitting the assembly of a full length Hct-1 coding sequence by de novo synthesis.

      It will also be possible to engineer recombinant yeast, for instance, to synthesise the substrate for the Hct-1 P450 in vivo, so as to allow production of the Hct-1 product from yeast supplied with a precursor, for instance cholesterol or other molecule, if that yeast is engineered to contain other P450's or modifying enzymes.

    <p num="95">
      In experiments to characterize transcripts enriched in the hippocampal formation we isolated cDNA clones corresponding to Hct-1 (hippocampal transcript) from a library prepared from rat hippocampus RNA.
      <br/>
      In rat, expression appeared to be most abundant in hippocampus with some expression in cortex and substantially less expression other in brain regions.
      <br/>
      Elsewhere in the body transcripts were only detected in liver and, to a lesser extent, in kidney; expression was barely de tect able in ovary, testis and adrenal, also sites of steroid transformations.
      <br/>
      Hepatic expression was sexually dimorphic with Hct-1 mRNA barely detectable in female liver.
      <br/>
      In rat brain and liver, Hct-1 identifies two transcripts of 1.8 and 2.1 kb that appear to be generated by alternative polyadenylation; a 5.0 kb transcript weakly detected in brain is thought not to originate from the Hct-1 gene but instead encodes a polypeptide related to the GTPase activating protein, ABR (active BCR-related).
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      Sequence analysis of Hct-1 cDNA clones revealed an extensive open reading frame encoding a protein with homology to cytochromes P450 (CYP's), a family of heme-containing mono-oxygenases responsible for a variety of steroid and fatty acid interconversions and the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics.
      <br/>
      Although the mouse cDNA coding region appears complete, the absence of a consensus translation initiation site flanking the presumed initiation codon could indicate that Hct-1 polypeptide synthesis is subject to regulation at the level of translation initiation.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      Homology was highest with rat and human cholesterol 7 ALPHA -hydroxylase, known as CYP7.
      <br/>
      While related, Hct-1 is clearly distinct from CYP7, sharing only 39% homology over the full length of the protein.
      <br/>
      CYP polypeptides sharing greater than 40% sequence identity are generally regarded as belonging to the to the same family, and Hct-1 and CYP7 (39% similarity) are hence borderline.
      <br/>
      The conservation of other unique features between Hct-1 and CYP7 however argues for a close relationship and Hct-1 has been provisionally named `CYP7B` by the P450 Nomenclature Committee (D. R. Nelson, personal communication).
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      From the Hct-1 leader sequence we surmise that the Hct-1 polypeptide resides, like CYP7, in the endoplasmic reticulum and not in mitochondria, the other principal cellular site of CYP activity.
      <br/>
      The strictly conserved heme binding site motif FxxGxxxCxG(xxxA) is clearly present in Hct-1 (residues 440-453).
      <br/>
      It is of note that the `steroidogenic domain`, conserved in many CYP's responsible for steroid interconversions, is also present in Hct-1 (amino acids 348-362), except that a consensus Pro residue is replaced by Val in both the mouse and rat Hct-1 polypeptides.
      <br/>
      Of previously known 34 CYP sequences, only 4 contain an amino acid residue other than Pro at this position.
      <br/>
      Whereas 2 of these harbour an unrelated amino acid (Glu; CYP3A1, CYP3A3), interestingly, a Val residue is present in bovine CYP17 (steroid 17a-hydroxylase, 44) at a position equivalent to that in Hct-1 while human CYP17 harbours a conservative substitution at this site (Leu; 44).
      <br/>
      Despite this similarity, however, the overall extent of homology between Hct-1 and CYP17 (22.5%, not shown) is lower than with CYP7 (39%).
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      Neither Hct-1 and CYP7 appear to contain a conserved O2 binding pocket (equivalent to residues 285-301 in Hct-1).
      <br/>
      Crystallographic studies on the bacterial CYP1O1 indicated that a Thr residue (corresponding to position 294 in Hct-1) disrupts helix formation in that region and is important in providing a structural pocket for an oxygen molecule.
      <br/>
      Site-directed mutagenesis of this Thr residue in both CYP4A1 and CYP2C11 demonstrated that this region can influence substrate specificity and affinity.
      <br/>
      In both Hct-1 and CYP7 the conserved Thr residue is replaced by Asn.
      <br/>
      This modification suggests that Hct-1 and CYP7 are both structurally distinct from other CYP's in this region; this may be reflected both in modified oxygen interaction and substrate choice.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      The sexual dimorphism of Hct-1 expression observed in rat resembles that observed with a number of other CYP's.
      <br/>
      CYP2C12 is expressed preferentially in liver of the female rat while, like Hct-1, CYP2C11 is highly expressed in male liver but only at low levels in the female tissue.
      <br/>
      This dimorphic expression pattern of CYP2C family members is thought to be determined by the dimorphism of pulsatility of growth hormone secretion.
      <br/>
      Brain expression of Hct-1 is not subject to this control suggesting that regulatory elements determining Hct-1 expression in brain differ from those utilized in liver.
      <br/>
      However, we have not examined species other than rat; it cannot be assumed that the same regulation will exist in other species.
      <br/>
      Indeed, sexually dimorphic gene expression is not necessarily conserved between different strains of mouse.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      Expression of Hct-1 was widespread in mouse brain.
      <br/>
      The expression pattern was most consistent with glial expression but further experiments will be required to compare neuronal and non-neuronal levels of expression.
      <br/>
      In mouse brain only the 1.8 kb transcript was detected, though cDNA's were obtained corresponding to transcripts extending beyond the first polyadenylation site; such extended transcripts are thought to give rise to the 2.1 kb transcript in rat.
      <br/>
      This suggests the downstream polyadenylation site seen in rat Hct-1 is under-utilized in mouse Hct-1 or absent.
      <br/>
      While in situ hybridization studies of Hct-1 in rat brain were inconclusive, a difference in expression pattern between mouse and rat appears likely; further work will be required to confirm this.
      <br/>
      However, such a difference would be unsurprising because cytochromes P450 are well known to vary widely in their level and pattern of expression in different species; for instance, hepatic testosterone 16-hydroxylation levels differ by more than 100-fold between guinea pig and rat.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      Our data indicate that the Hct-1 gene is present in rat, mouse and human, and there appear to be no very close relatives in the mammalian genome.
      <br/>
      While CYP genes are scattered over the mouse and human genomes, CYP subfamilies can cluster on the same chromosome.
      <br/>
      For instance, the human CYP2A and 2B subfamily genes are linked to chromosome 19, CYP2C and 2E subfamilies are located on human chromosome 10, and the mouse cyp2a, 2b and 2e subfamilies are present on mouse chromosome 7.

      The gene encoding human cholesterol 7 ALPHA -hydroxylase (CYP7) is located on chromosome 8q11-q12.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Together our data argue that Hct-1 and CYP7 are closely related: this suggests that the substrate for Hct-1, so far unknown, is likely to be related to cholesterol or one of its steroid metabolites.
      <br/>
      This interpretation is borne out by the presence, in Hct-1, of the steriodogenic domain conserved in a number of steroid-metabolizing CYP's.
      <br/>
      While experiments are underway to determine the substrate specificity of Hct-1, the possibility that Hct-1 acts on cholesterol or its steroid metabolites in brain is of some interest.
      <br/>
      CYP7 (cholesterol 7 ALPHA -hydroxylase) is responsible for the first step in the metabolic degradation of cholesterol.
      <br/>
      This is of note in view of the association of particular alleles of the APOE gene encoding the cholesterol transporter protein apolipoprotein E with the onset of Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative condition whose cognitive impairments are associated with early dysfunction of the hippocampus.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      What role might Hct-1 play in the brain? In the adult CYP's are generally expressed abundantly in liver, adrenal and gonads, while the level of CYP activity in brain is estimated to be 0.3 to 3% of that found in liver (see 58).
      <br/>
      Because levels of Hct-1 mRNA expression in rat and mouse brain far exceed those in liver it could be argued that the primary function of Hct-1 lies in the central nervous system.
      <br/>
      The documented ability of cholesterol-derived steroids to interact with neurotransmitter receptors and modulate both synaptic plasticity and cognitive function suggests that Hct-1 and its metabolic product(s) may regulate neuronal function in vivo.
    </p>
    <p num="105">5. SUMMARY</p>
    <p num="106">
      Hct-1 (hippocampal transcript) was detected in a differential screen of a rat hippocampal cDNA library.
      <br/>
      Expression of Hct-1 was enriched in the formation but was also detected in rat liver and kidney, though at much lower levels; expression was barely detectable in testis, ovary and adrenal.
      <br/>
      In liver, unlike brain, expression was sexually dimorphic: hepatic expression was greatly reduced in female rats.
      <br/>
      In mouse, brain expression in was widespread, with the highest levels being detected in corpus callosum; only low levels were detected in liver.
      <br/>
      Sequence analysis of rat and mouse Hct-1 cDNAs revealed extensive homologies with cytochrome P450's (CYP's), a diverse family of heme-binding monooxygenases that metabolize a range of substrates including steroids, fatty acids and xenobiotics.
      <br/>
      Among the CYP's, Hct-1 is most similar (39% at the amino acid sequence) to cholesterol 7 ALPHA -hydroxylase (CYP7), and contains the diagnostic steriodogenic domain present in other steriod-metabolizing CYPs, but clearly represents a type of CYP not previously reported.
      <br/>
      Genomic Southern analysis indicates that a single gene corresponding to Hct-1 is present in mouse, rat and human.
      <br/>
      Hct-1 is unusual in that, unlike all other CYP's described, the primary site of expression is in the brain.
      <br/>
      Similarity to CYP7 and other steroid-metabolizing CYP's argues that Hct-1 plays a role in steroid metabolism in brain, notable because of the documented ability of brain-derived steroids (neurosteroids) to modulate cognitive function in vivo.
