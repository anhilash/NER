    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="7">The invention pertains to an apparatus 10 for automatically stacking flat folded cartons or container boxes 100, see FIG. 2, of non-uniform thickness into a slug 102, see FIG. 18, and then automatically stuffing the slug 102 of folded cartons 100 into a shipping container 104, such as a corrugated cardboard box.</p>
    <p num="8">
      The apparatus 10 is supplied with a stream or line of folded cartons 100 overlapping each other like shingles.
      <br/>
      The stream of folded cartons 100 can be supplied by, for example, a conventional gluing device used to make the folded cartons 100.
      <br/>
      Such conventional gluing devices can produce folded cartons, in a top shingle form, at a rate of about 50,000 cartons/hour.
      <br/>
      The present apparatus is capable of processing the folded cartons 100 at this rate.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Referring now to FIGS. 1A and 1B, the apparatus 10 of the present invention includes a main support structure 20 and a conveyor apparatus 30 supported by the support structure 20.
      <br/>
      The conveyor apparatus 30 comprises upper and lower primary conveyor belts 32 and 34 which, in the illustrated embodiment, receive the stream of folded cartons (the stream of cartons is not shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B) from a conventional gluing device 40, see FIG. 1A. A discriminator 42 is positioned at a leading end 33a of the primary conveyor belts 32 and 34.
      <br/>
      As will be discussed more explicitly below, after a predefined number of cartons 100 have been conveyed to an exit end 33c of the belts 32 and 34, the first and second belts 32 and 34 dwell for a predetermined amount of time.
      <br/>
      When the belts 32 and 34 begin to rotate after the dwell period has ended, the discriminator 42 spaces apart the cartons 100 which have accumulated at the leading end 33a of the belts 32 and 34.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      An upper drive roller 32a effects movement of the upper belt 32 and a lower drive roller 34a effects movement of the lower belt 34.
      <br/>
      The drive rollers 32a and 34a are coupled to and driven by a commercially available first hydraulic motor (not shown).
      <br/>
      A solenoid (not shown) controlled by a programmable logic controller 15, see FIG. 1A, opens and closes a first control valve (not shown) which in turn controls the operation of the first hydraulic motor.
      <br/>
      The speed of the first hydraulic motor is manually adjustable by way of a conventional first needle valve flow control (not shown), which is positioned between the first control valve and the motor.
      <br/>
      Thus, the first hydraulic motor is turned on and off via the solenoid and the first control valve and its speed is adjusted via the first valve flow control.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the belts 32 and 34 are driven at a speed which is greater than the speed at which the cartons 100 are supplied to the apparatus 10 by the device 40 so as to compensate for the dwell periods of the belts 32 and 34.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The shingled row of folded cartons are moved from the leading end 33a of the opposing conveyer belts 32 and 34 along a path 33b defined between the opposing belts 32 and 34 to the exit end 33c of the belts 32 and 34.
      <br/>
      The row of folded cartons 100 are then conveyed between a plurality of upper idler rollers 36, three in the illustrated embodiment, and a lower secondary conveyer belt 38.
      <br/>
      A drive roller 38a, coupled to and driven by the first hydraulic motor, effects movement of the belt 38.
      <br/>
      The belt 38 moves at substantially the same speed as the belts 32 and 34.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The upper rollers 36 are arranged in coaxial pairs and are mounted on a metal spring 36a.
      <br/>
      The upper rollers 36 in each pair are spread apart and mounted so as to contact and press the folded cartons 100 down onto the lower secondary conveyer belt 38.
      <br/>
      In this way, the folded cartons 100 are kept in contact with the lower secondary conveyer belt 38 such that the cartons 100 move at substantially the same linear speed as the belt 38.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Maintaining this contact enables the lower secondary conveyer belt 38 to convey the shingled row of folded cartons 100 in between a pair of top pinch rollers 39a and a pair of driven, bottom pinch rollers 39b.
      <br/>
      A second hydraulic motor (not shown) effects movement of the bottom pinch rollers 39b.
      <br/>
      The second motor runs continuously during operation of the apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      Its speed is manually adjustable by way of a second valve flow control (not shown).
      <br/>
      Preferably, the rollers 39b are driven at a speed which exceeds that of the rollers 32a, 34a and 38a.
      <br/>
      The pinch rollers 39a and 39b launch the folded cartons 100 outwardly into stack forming apparatus 49 at a stack building station.
      <br/>
      The stack forming apparatus 49 includes a first stack building hopper or first bin 50.
      <br/>
      A leading edge of each airborne folded carton hits a back plate 55 (e.g., a stop surface) forming the back wall of the first bin 50.
      <br/>
      With its momentum thus arrested, each folded carton 100 settles down into the bottom of the first bin 50.
      <br/>
      In this way, a first stack of the folded cartons 100 can be formed in the first bin 50.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The speed and angle at which the pinch rollers 39a and 39b expel the folded cartons 100 are important to the stack building process.
      <br/>
      If they are expelled too slowly or too quickly, or at an unsuitable angle, the folded cartons 100 will not settle into an even stack at the bottom of the first bin 50.
      <br/>
      The formation of uniform stacks of the folded cartons 100 is important to the downline operations of the present apparatus.
      <br/>
      The desired speed of the pinch rollers 39a and 39b and, hence, the desired speed of travel of the folded cartons 100 as they are expelled from the pinch rollers 39a and 39b, is controlled by the second flow control and is varied depending upon the mass of each folded carton 100.
      <br/>
      In general, as the mass of the folded carton 100 increases, its speed of travel should decrease.
      <br/>
      The carton ejection angle is adjusted by varying the position of the upper pinch rollers 39a.
      <br/>
      If the upper rollers 39a are moved to the left in FIG. 1B, the angle at which the cartons 100 are ejected will decrease, i.e., the angle will move downwardly toward the first bin 50.
      <br/>

      A conventional optical sensor 35, such as one which is manufactured by QTMS and commercially available from Plum Tree Co., Savannah, Ga., under the product designation "Copy Counter 2," is positioned so as to sense the folded cartons 100 as they exit from between the rollers 36 and the belt 38, see FIG. 1B. A conventional optical counter (not shown), which is commercially available from Red Lion Controls, U.S.A., York, Pa., and sold under the product designation "LIBC1E00," receives count signals from the sensor 35.
      <br/>
      Based upon these received signals, received signals, the counter keeps count of the cartons 100 exiting between the rollers 36 and the belt 38.
      <br/>
      Once the desired number of folded cartons 100 for forming a stack 110 is reached, the optical counter generates a stack-completed signal to the controller 15.
      <br/>
      After receiving the stack-completed signal, the controller 15 temporarily halts the operation of the conveyer belts 32, 34 and 38.
      <br/>
      For the above described exemplary folded carton 100, stacks of 25 folded cartons 100 have been found desirable.
      <br/>
      The conveyer belts 32, 34 and 38 are stopped long enough to create a gap in the stream of cartons 100 traveling to the first bin 50.
      <br/>
      For the above described exemplary folded carton and belt speeds, satisfactory results have been obtained when the conveyer belts 32, 34 and 38 are stopped for a period of from about 0.2 second to about 0.5 second and most preferably about 0.3 second in between each count of 25 folded cartons.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      After the operation of the conveyer belts 32, 34 and 38 has been temporarily stopped, the controller 15 activates a pneumatically actuated mechanism 80 forming part of an interrupt finger assembly 90, see FIGS. 4A-4E, so as to move a pair of interrupt fingers 92 forming part of the assembly 90 from a standby position, away from an entrance 50a into the first bin 50, see FIG. 1B, to an interrupt position over the entrance 50a to the first bin 50 to prevent any folded cartons 100 exiting the pinch rollers 39a and 39b from entering the first bin 50.
      <br/>
      In this way, the interrupt fingers 92 act as a safety feature to prevent the folded cartons 100 for a subsequent stack from being added to the preceding stack.
      <br/>
      The interrupt fingers 92 accomplish this by blocking the path into the first bin 50 until the preceding stack has dropped out of the first bin 50 and into the second bin 150 and the support bars 52a and 54a have returned to their closed position.
      <br/>
      The activation of the pneumatically actuated mechanism 80 is timed so that the movement of the interrupt fingers 92 does not interfere with the complete formation of a stack 110.
      <br/>
      That is, after the operation of the belts 32, 34 and 38 is temporarily halted, the controller 15 delays the movement of the interrupt fingers 92 to their interrupt position long enough to allow the last folded carton 100 of the preceding stack to settle into the first bin 50.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      It is believed that the interrupt fingers 92 could be eliminated by choosing a delay period for the temporary halting of the conveyer belts 32, 34 and 38 which is long enough to ensure that folded cartons 100 for the next stack do not reach the first bin 50 until the preceding stack has left the first bin 50 and the first and second support bars 52a and 54a have returned to their closed position.
      <br/>
      Though, it is believed more desirable for the apparatus 10 to include the interrupt finger feature because it allows this delay period to be reduced, thereby increasing the overall throughput rate of the apparatus 10.

      The interrupt finger assembly 90 further comprises a frame 94 coupled to a pair of linear bearings 94a which move along two shafts 20a fixedly connected to the support structure 20, see FIGS. 4D and 4E. First and second adjustable stops 20b and 20c are provided on each of the two shafts 20a and are spaced apart from one another so as to define portions of the shafts 20a along which the linear bearings 94a may travel.

      Each bolt 94b passes through a bore in one of the stops 20c.

      A second pair of shafts 95d extend between the third and fourth plates 95b and 95c, see FIGS. 4A-4D. A pair of linear bearings 95e move along the shafts 95d.

      The pneumatically actuated mechanism 80 effects movement of the plate 96 and hence the fingers 92 toward and away from the pinch rollers 39a and 39b.
      <br/>
      The mechanism 80 includes a piston/cylinder unit 86 having a piston 86a and a cylinder 86b.
      <br/>
      The piston/cylinder unit 86 is associated with an interrupt finger valve (not shown) connected to the source of pressurized pneumatic fluid.
      <br/>
      A solenoid (not shown) is provided to open and close the interrupt finger valve which in turn controls the operation of the unit 86.
      <br/>
      The operation of the solenoid is controlled via the controller 15.

    <p num="32">
      The cylinder 86b is fixedly connected to the fourth plate 95c.
      <br/>
      The piston 86a is fixedly connected to the plate 96 via a block 96a such that the plate 96 moves with the piston 86a.
      <br/>
      When the piston 86a is extended, the plate 96 is positioned adjacent to the third plate 95b and the interrupt fingers 92 are in their standby position.
      <br/>
      When the piston 86a is retracted, the plate 96 is positioned near the fourth plate 95c and the interrupt fingers 92 are in their interrupt position.

      The back plate 55 of the first bin 50 is fixedly mounted to the fourth plate 95c so as to move with the fourth plate 95c.
      <br/>
      When the piston 86a is moved to its retracted position, i.e., is moved into the cylinder 86b, its causes the plate 96 and the bearings 95e coupled to the plate 96 to move from a position adjacent to the third plate 95b to a position adjacent to the fourth plate 95c.
      <br/>
      The fingers 92 also move from their standby position to their interrupt position.
      <br/>
      The change in momentum of the plate 96, the bearings 95e, the fingers 92 and the piston 86a, as they come to a rest once the piston 86a has been fully retracted into the cylinder 86b, results in the first plate 94d, the bearings 94a, the U-shaped structure 95 and the elements secured to the U-shaped structure 95 moving slightly towards the first bin 50.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4A, one of the bearings 94a and the plate 94d are shown in phantom moving to the right against the force of the spring 94c.
      <br/>
      The bolt 94b is also shown in phantom moving through the bore in the stop 20c such that the head of the bolt 94b is spaced from a side wall of the stop 20c.
      <br/>
      This movement of the U-shaped structure 95 results in the back plate 55 moving a short distance toward the stack 110 of cartons 100 in the first bin 50 such that the back plate 55 engages the stack 110.
      <br/>
      By engaging the stack 110, the back plate 55 acts as an alignment device to square-up or vertically align the stack 110 before it drops from the first bin 50 into the second bin 150.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to maintain the stacks in a vertically aligned or squared-up condition to help ensure trouble-free processing through the apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      For the above described exemplary folded carton 100, the back plate 55 moves a distance of about 0.25 inch.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Right after the back plate 55 stops moving, the first and second support bars 52a and 54a are opened and the squared-up stack 110 is dropped into the second bin 150.
      <br/>
      The interrupt fingers 90 remain over the first bin entrance, in the interrupt position, until the stack 110 that bad just been formed has dropped down into the second bin 150 and the first and second support bars 52a and 54a have closed.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Thus, once a predetermined number of cartons 100, e.g., 25, have been counted by the optical counter, the controller 15 causes the belts 32, 34 and 38 to dwell for a predefined period of time, e.g., 0.3 second.
      <br/>
      The interrupt fingers 92 then move to their interrupt position such that any cartons 100 for a subsequent stack are prevented from being added to the preceding stack in the first bin 50.
      <br/>
      Also, the back plate 55 contacts the cartons 100 in the first bin 50 to align or square-up those cartons 100.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the first and second support bars 52a and 54a separate from one another so as to drop the squared-up stack 110 into the second bin 150.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      When the flow of folded cartons 100 resumes at the end of the dwell period, the pinch rollers 39a and 39b initially deposit the folded cartons 100 on top of the interrupt fingers 90 to begin the formation of the next stack 110.
      <br/>
      If the interrupt fingers 90 are not used, as described above, the folded cartons 100 forming the next stack 110 are deposited directly into the first bin 50 in the same manner as the first stack.

      After the first stack, designated by the reference numeral 100a in FIG. 3B, has dropped into the second bin 150 and the first and second support bars 52a and 54a of the first bin 50 have closed, the controller 15 activates the pneumatically actuated mechanism 80 to extend the piston 86a until the interrupt fingers 90 are returned to their standby position, in preparation of being moved again to catch the folded cartons 100 that will form the beginning of the next or third stack.
      <br/>
      While the interrupt fingers 90 are moving back to the standby position, the pinch rollers 39a and 39b continue to deposit folded cartons 100 into the first bin 50, continuing to build the second stack.
      <br/>
      Further, the folded cartons 100 positioned on the interrupt fingers 90 move off the fingers 90 due to their engagement with the plate 55 and drop down to the bottom of the first bin 50, coming to rest on the first and second support bars 52a and 54a.

When a second stack of folded cartons, designated by the reference numeral 110b in FIG. 3B, is formed, the first and second support bars 52a and 54a are opened in the same way as described above for the first stack 100a.

      The sprocket ring 162 is rotated only after every odd number stack 100 is deposited on the third and fourth support bars 152a and 154a.

Because each stack has one side that is thicker than the other, stacking the first and second stacks 100a and 100b in this way forms a double stack with a top carton 100 and a bottom carton 100 that are generally parallel.

      While two stacks 110 wait in the third bin 250, the first and second support bars 52a and 54a are opened to allow a third stack of folded cartons 110, built in the first bin 50, to be dropped from the first bin 50 to the second bin 150 and onto the third and fourth support bars 152a and 154a.
      <br/>
      The first and second support bars 52a and 54a are then closed, and the sprocket ring 162 is rotated 180 (degree) . During rotation of the sprocket ring 162, the fifth and sixth gates 252a and 254a open causing the first and second stacks 110a and 110b to drop down into the fourth bin 350.
      <br/>
      After allowing the double stack to drop into the fourth bin 350, the fifth and sixth support bars 252a and 254a are closed in order to receive the next double stack that will be dropping from the second bin 150 in the manner described above for the previously formed double stack (i.e., the first and second stacks).

      The fourth stack is formed and drops through the first and second support bars 52a and 54a in the same manner as described above for the second stack.

      As soon as the first and second support bars 52a and 54a close, the third and fourth support bars 152a and 154a open to allow the double stack, i.e., the third and fourth stacks, to fall from the second bin 150 into the third bin 250.
      <br/>
      As will be discussed further below, the fourth bin 350 opens at the same time that the third and fourth support bars 152a and 154a open.

      The fourth bin 350 (shown in FIG. 1) is constructed in essentially the same manner as the third bin 250 and, therefore, will only be briefly described herein.

      <br/>
      Briefly, the seventh gate assembly includes a movable seventh support bar and the eighth gate assembly includes a movable eighth support bar.
      <br/>
      The seventh and eighth support bars are movable between open and closed positions.

      <br/>
      The seventh and eighth pneumatically actuated mechanisms include seventh and eighth piston/cylinder units which are in fluid communication with the control valve which controls the operation of the third and fourth piston/cylinder units 162 and 172.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the third and fourth support bars 152a and 154a are opened, the seventh and eighth support bars simultaneously open, and the double stack located in the fourth bin 350 drops down into and settles onto the bottom of a slug building/tilting hopper or pivotable slug bin 410 in a slug forming station 400, see FIG. 1B. Likewise, when the third and fourth support bars 152a and 154a close, the seventh and eighth support bars close, and the fourth bin 350 is ready to receive the next double stack of folded cartons 100.

    <p num="56">
      An optical sensor, such as a photosensor (not shown), or some other suitable sensor is mounted adjacent to the fourth bin 350 so as to generate a signal to the controller 15 when a double stack is located in the fourth bin 350.

      The above operation is repeated until a sufficient number of double stacks (i.e., an even number of alternating stacks) accumulate in the slug bin 410 to form a slug 102 of a desired size.

      For the exemplary folded carton 100 described above, satisfactory results have been obtained with each slug 102 built containing five double stacks of the folded cartons 100.

      Thus, the slug bin 410 is ready to receive the next double stack.

      <br/>
      By limiting the distance each double stack drops between bins, the likelihood is reduced that one or more folded cartons 100 in each stack 110 will move, causing a stack 110 to lose its square or a jam in the process.

      In the illustrated embodiment, the basket 510 is tilted clockwise 60 (degree)  from horizontal before it is moved into position to receive the slug 102 by the assembly 520, see FIG. 1B.

      A hydraulic piston/cylinder assembly 540 is provided comprising a piston 542 mounted to the basket 510 via an arm 511 and a cylinder 544 mounted to the frame 532, see FIG. 10. Back and forth movement of the piston 542 effects pivotable movement of the basket 510 which is fixedly mounted to a pivotable shaft 550.
      <br/>
      The shaft 550 is pivotably mounted to the frame 532.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      Signals from the sensors are provided to the controller 15.
    </p>
    <p num="76">As noted above, when the piston 522 is fully retracted into the cylinder 524, the carriage 530 is positioned in its slug unload position, see FIG. 15. When the slug basket 510 is horizontally positioned and the carriage 530 is located in its slug unload position, the slug 102 of cartons 100 is partially located on a pusher table 610 in a slug unload station 600, see also FIG. 16.</p>
    <p num="77">
      When the slug 102 is located on the pusher table 610, a first end 102a of the slug 102 abuts two first side guides 612, see FIG. 15. Each first side guide 612 comprises a first plate 612a, two first shafts 614a (not shown in FIG. 15 ) and two linear bearings 616a (not shown in FIG. 15) which receive the shafts 614a, see also FIGS. 9 and 10. The shafts 614a are movable within the linear bearings 616a so as to allow the plates 612a to be moved to a desired position.
      <br/>
      Once the plates 612a are properly positioned, the shafts 614a are releasably locked in place bu locking clamps bolted to the bearings 616a.
      <br/>
      As will be discussed further below, each plate 612a has a guide slot 612b, see FIGS. 1B and 10, which receives a tab on a first outer edge 704a of a slug pusher bar 704.

    <p num="78">
      A second end 102b of the slug 102 abuts two second side guides 622 when the slug 102 is located on the pusher table 610, see FIGS. 15 and 16. Each second guide 622 comprises a second plate 622a fixedly mounted to two shafts 622b which, in turn, are rotatably mounted to the support structure 20 by bearings or the like, see FIGS. 11 and 12. An arm 622c is fixedly mounted to one of the shafts 622b such that movement of the arm 622c effects pivotable movement of the plate 622a between opened and closed positions.
      <br/>
      When the second plates 622a are open, the slug basket 510 is permitted to be moved from its slug receiving position, shown in FIG. 1B, to its slug unload position, shown in FIG. 15. Each plate 622a has a guide slot 623 which receives a tab on a second outer edge 704b of the slug pusher bar 704, as will be discussed further below.
      <br/>
      The second plates 622a are not illustrated in FIG. 9.

    <p num="79">
      A second side guide piston/cylinder assembly 630 is provided to effect pivotable movement of the two second plates 622a, see FIGS. 11 and 12. The assembly 630 comprises a piston/cylinder unit 632 having a piston 632a which is fixedly coupled to a movable bar 634.
      <br/>
      Two guide shafts 636 movable within two linear bearings 638 are also fixedly coupled to the bar 634.
      <br/>
      Two links 639 extend between and are coupled to opposing ends of the bar 634 and the arms 622c.
      <br/>
      Thus, back and forth movement of the piston 632a effects pivotable movement of the second plates 622a.

    <p num="81">
      Once the slug 102 has been moved into the slug unload station 600, see FIG. 15, the second guide plates 622a are closed via the assembly 630.
      <br/>
      The slug pusher bar 704 is then extended so as to move the now supine slug 102 of cartons 110 into a shipping container 104, such as a corrugated cardboard box, see FIG. 18. The slug pusher bar 704 is then returned to its home position and the basket 510 is moved from its horizontal position to its tilted, slug receiving position, i.e., is moved 60 (degree)  from horizontal.

      The apparatus 10 can be adjusted to accommodate cartons having varying widths W. First, the distance between the slug receiving basket 510, when it is positioned as shown in FIG. 1B, and the slug bin 410, when it is tilted, is changed.
      <br/>
      This is effected by moving the movable section 22b relative to the stationary section 22a.
      <br/>
      As the movable section 22b moves, the slug receiving basket 510 moves relative to the slug bin 410 and the stationary section 22a.
      <br/>
      Further, the floating frame 430 and, hence, the slug bin 410 move vertically relative to the basket 510.
      <br/>
      The location of the movable section 22b relative to the section 22a is adjusted until: 1) the distance between the tilted basket 510 and the tiled slug bin 410 is equal to or greater than the carton width W, and 2) the side 510b of the basket 510 closest to the slug bin 410 lines up with the upper surface of the movable platform 414a when the slug bin 410 is tilted 30 (degree)  and the basket is rotated 60 (degree) . The location of the back plate 55 is also adjusted by changing the positions of the stops 20b and 20c.
      <br/>
      The front and rear walls 157a and 157b of the second bin 150, the front and rear walls of the third bin 250 and the front and rear walls of the fourth bin 350 are also adjusted to accommodate the changed carton width W.

      To allow the shipping box 104 to receive one or more slugs 102 of folded cartons 100, the shipping box 104 is positioned on a case rack 800 adjacent to the slug unload station 600, see FIGS. 15 and 17. The case rack 800 is pivotably mounted to a case rack frame 810, see also FIG. 1B. The case rack 800 comprises a plurality of first arms 812a mounted to a pivotable shaft 814 which in turn is mounted to the frame 810.
      <br/>
      The rack 800 further includes second arms 812b which are mounted to the first arms 812a.
      <br/>
      A piston cylinder unit 816 is provided for effecting pivotable movement of the arms 812a and 812b between box supporting and box discharge positions.
      <br/>
      The unit 816 includes a piston 816a pivotably coupled to a case rack arm 818 which in turn is fixedly mounted to the shaft 814, see FIG. 17. Pivotable movement of the arm 818 via the piston 816a effects rotary movement of the shaft 814.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the piston 816a is extended, the arms 812a and 812b are in their box supporting position, see FIGS. 15 and 17. When so positioned, the arms 812a and 812b maintain a box 102 adjacent to the slug unload station 600 so as to allow the box 102 to receive one or more slugs 102 of cartons 100.
      <br/>
      When the piston 816a is retracted, the arms 812a and 812b are in their discharge position, see FIG. 1B, such that the box 104 is discharged onto a lift table assembly 900, which will be described below.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      A case guide 820 is mounted to the frame 810 and is engaged by the shipping box 104 when the box 104 is mounted in the case rack 800 and the latter is in its box supporting position.
      <br/>
      The case guide 820 serves to align and support the box 104 when it is in its slug receiving position.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      It is desirable for the shipping box 104 to be capable of containing two, or even more, of the slugs 102.
      <br/>
      Once one slug 102 is stuffed or moved into the shipping box 104, the case rack frame 810 drops down.
      <br/>
      The frame 810 includes four linear bearings 810a which move along shafts 810b coupled to the support structure 20.
      <br/>
      Vertical movement of the frame 810 along the shafts 810b is effected via a piston/cylinder unit 811.
      <br/>
      The operation of the unit 811 is controlled by the controller 15.
      <br/>
      As noted above, the pivotable shaft 814 is mounted to the frame 810.
      <br/>
      Thus, the first and second rack arms 812a and 812b together with the shipping box 104 move with the frame 810.
      <br/>
      The frame 810 is dropped via the piston/cylinder unit 811 from a first load position to a second load position so that the slug 102 that was just stuffed into the box 104 is below the level of the next slug 104 to be stuffed.
      <br/>
      The next slug 102 is formed and maneuvered into position to be stuffed as described above with regard to the first slug 102.
    </p>
    <p num="89">Two conventional sensors 810d such as proximity sensors are mounted on the support structure 20 and sense a flag 810e mounted to the frame 810 so as to sense when the frame 810 is in its first or second load position, see FIGS. 1B and 15. Signals from the sensors 810d are provided to the controller 15.</p>
    <p num="90">
      To facilitate stuffing the next slug 102 into the shipping box 104, a sheet inserter 850 is moved into the shipping box 104, above the slug 102 that was just stuffed.
      <br/>
      The sheet inserter 850 can be made of plastic, metal or any other suitable material and is sized to accommodate the size of the shipping container 104 being stuffed.
      <br/>
      The inserter 850 is moved between inserted and retracted positions via an inserter piston/cylinder unit 860, see FIGS. 13 and 14. The unit 860 includes a piston 860a which is connected to an inserter arm 852.
      <br/>
      The arm 852 is fixedly coupled to a shaft 852a which in turn is fixedly coupled to the inserter 850.
      <br/>
      Retraction of the piston 860a effects movement of the inserter 850 to its inserted position.
      <br/>
      When so positioned, the inserter 850 passes through the case guide 820 and into the box 104.
      <br/>
      Extension of the piston 860a effects movement of the inserter 850 to its retracted position, see FIGS. 13 and 14.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      Two conventional sensors 855, see FIGS. 13 and 14, such as proximity sensors are mounted to the support structure 20 and sense the inserter 850 when it is in one of its inserted and retracted positions.
      <br/>
      Signals from the sensors 855 are provided to the controller 15.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Once the inserter 850 has been moved to its inserted position, the next slug 102 is pushed into the shipping box 104.
      <br/>
      The sheet inserter 850 helps to prevent individual folded cartons 100 from any slug 102 subsequently stuffed into the same shipping container 104 from falling down between folded cartons in or otherwise getting hung-up by the previously stuffed slug 102.
      <br/>
      If more than two slugs are stuffed into the same shipping container, the preceding process is repeated until the shipping container is full.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      The unit 816 then causes the rack arms 812a and 812b to move to their discharge position such that the box 104 is pivoted downward and deposited onto the lift table assembly 900.
      <br/>
      The lift table assembly 900 comprises a pivotable lift table 910 and a piston/cylinder unit 920 for effecting pivotable movement of the lift table 910.
      <br/>
      The operation of the unit 920 is controlled by the controller 15.
      <br/>
      Once the box 104 is positioned on the lift table 910, the unit 920 effects upward movement of the table 910 so as to deposit the box 104 onto a discharge conveyor 950.
      <br/>
      The assembly 900 and the conveyor 950 are not shown in FIG. 17. The shipping container 104 is then sealed and processed for shipping.
