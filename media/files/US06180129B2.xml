    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention pertains to both a novel and to an unobvious delivery system.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention relates to a delivery system comprising (1) housing means, (2) a compartment, and (3) exit means.
      <br/>
      The housing means comprises (a) a section that substantially restricts the ingress of fluid into the delivery system, and (b) a section that permits the ingress of fluid into the delivery system.
      <br/>
      The compartment comprises (c) a bioavailable and biocompatible beneficial agent formulation and (d) means for delivering the agent formulation from the delivery system.
      <br/>
      The exit means comprises (e) at least one passageway in the housing means for connecting the exterior with the interior of the delivery system for delivering the agent formulation from the delivery system.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Delivery systems for administering a beneficial agent to a biological, fluid environment of use are known to the prior art.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,845,770 issued to Theeuwes and Higuchi, and in U.S. Pat. No. 3,916,899 issued to the same patentees, a device is disclosed comprising a wall that surrounds a compartment containing a beneficial agent.
      <br/>
      The wall is permeable to the passage of fluid and comprises a passageway that is preformed or formed during use through the wall for delivering the beneficial agent from the device.
      <br/>
      The devices of these patents release the beneficial agent by fluid being imbibed through the wall into the compartment at a rate determined by the permeability of the wall and the osmotic pressure gradient across the wall.
      <br/>
      The fluid imbibed into the device mixes with the beneficial agent to form an aqueous solution comprising the beneficial agent that is dispensed through the passageway from the device.
      <br/>
      The devices of these patents are extraordinarily effective for delivering a beneficial agent that is stable and soluble in aqueous and biological fluids and exhibits an osmotic pressure gradient across the wall against the fluid.
      <br/>
      The devices are effective also for delivering a beneficial agent that is mixed with an osmotically effective solute soluble in fluid that exhibits an osmotic pressure gradient across the wall against an aqueous fluid.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A further advancement in the delivery art for dispensing a stable formulation is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,995,632 issued to Nakano, Higuchi and Hussain.
      <br/>
      The dispenser disclosed in this patent dispenses a stable composition that absorbs heat and forms a dispensable melt.
      <br/>
      The melt is dispensed by a solution of magnesium sulfate increasing in volume and occupying the space originally occupied by the melt.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A quantum improvement in osmotic devices was presented to the pharmaceutical dispensing art by inventor Theeuwes in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,111,202; 4,111,203; and 4,203,439.
      <br/>
      In these patents the delivery kinetics of the devices were enhanced for delivering a beneficial agent with different degrees of solubility in an aqueous-type fluid.
      <br/>
      The kinetics were improved by manufacturing the devices with a beneficial agent compartment separated by a film from an osmotic compartment.
      <br/>
      The devices deliver the beneficial agent by fluid being imbibed through the wall into the osmotic compartment to fill the compartment with fluid that acts as a driving force and causes the film to move.
      <br/>
      The film moves against the beneficial agent compartment and the driving force pushes the beneficial agent through a passageway from the device.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A pioneer advancement in osmotic delivery devices was made by Cortese and Theeuwes in U.S. Pat. No. 4,327,725 and by Wong, Barclay, Deters and Theeuwes in U.S. Pat. No. 4,612,008. The devices disclosed in these patents comprise a semipermeable wall that surrounds a compartment.
      <br/>
      The compartment contains a beneficial agent formulation and a hydrogel.
      <br/>
      These devices operate by imbibing fluid into the compartment, wherein it contacts the biological agent formulation and forms a dispensable aqueous formulation, and wherein it contacts the hydrogel causing it to expand and push the dispensable aqueous formulation from the device.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The delivery devices described in the above patents operate successfully for their intended use and they can deliver many beneficial agents for their intended effects.
      <br/>
      Now, it has been observed their use can be limited because they lack the necessary elements to deliver beneficial agents that are sensitive to fluids, and to fluids containing biological gases.
      <br/>
      Their use may be limited because beneficial agents that are sensitive to such aqueous-biological fluids or to other fluids external to the delivery device may be adversely affected by fluids that enter the device and contact the beneficial agents during operation of the device.
      <br/>
      Examples of such fluid sensitive agents include proteins and peptides, and hormones.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the prior art devices lack the necessary means for their use as implant devices for dispensing such sensitive agents to a biological fluid-rich environment of use.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      It will be appreciated by those versed in the dispensing arts that if a delivery system is provided for administering at a controlled rate and for protecting a beneficial agent that is sensitive to aqueous and biological fluids, and which delivery system possesses the kinetic ability to deliver the protected beneficial agent in effective amounts over time, such a delivery system would have a positive value and represent an advancement in the dispensing arts.
      <br/>
      Likewise, it will be self-evident to those versed in the implant art that a pressing need exists for an implant that is essentially-free of the tribulation associated with the prior art, and, that if such an implantable delivery system is provided, it would have a practical application in the fields of human and veterinary medicine and in the breeding and management of farm animals.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">Accordingly, it is an immediate object of this invention to provide a delivery system for delivering a beneficial agent that overcomes the limitations associated with the prior art.</p>

      One technique that has been found to be eminently well-suited is to cast or hot press a film of the composition to a thickness in the range of 1 to 60 mils.
      <br/>
      The film is used as a barrier between a fluid source and a container initially free of fluid.
      <br/>

      The semipermeable wall that surrounds a compartment for containing the osmotically active tablet is prepared as follows: first, 3.85 kg of cellulose acetate butyrate and 1.15 kg of tributyl citrate are dry mixed in a mixer for 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      This produced a polymer plasticizer blend of a 77/23 ratio for the rate controlling wall 12b.
      <br/>
      Next, a rubber mill is used to melt blend the blend, at a roller temperature of 70 (degree)  C. The blend is transferred to the moving rollers of the mill and mixed for 3 minutes.
      <br/>
      Then, after all the materials are added to the mill, the temperature is raised to 90 (degree)  C., followed by milling for 2 minutes, next the temperature is raised to 115 (degree)  C. and followed by two more milling minutes, then the temperature is increased to 133 (degree)  C. and followed by six minutes of milling the blend, and then the temperature is increased to 144 (degree)  C. and followed by six minutes of milling the blend.
      <br/>
      After the rollers are cooled to 50 (degree)  C., the blend is removed from the mill.
      <br/>
      The milled blend is cut into strips and passed through a grinder mill, and the resulting particles fed into an injection molder and molded into the semipermeable wall surrounding a compartment with an opened end for receiving an expandable driving member and for mating with the lead section of the delivery system.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Next, the lead, first wall section of the delivery system is prepared by adding 5 kg of polycarbonate to a hopper dryer and drying the polymer at 250 (degree)  F. for 4 hours.
      <br/>
      Then, the dry polymer is fed into the hopper of an injection molder, where a single cavity hot tip mold is used to injection mold an impermeable wall surrounding a compartment with an open end for receiving components and for mating with the semipermeable wall member.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Next, the delivery system is assembled by first charging the subassembly semipermeable walled member with three osmotic tablets.
      <br/>
      Then, microcrystalline wax is melted and the molten wax poured on the top of the osmotic tablet to completely fill to the opened walled member.
      <br/>
      The charged subassembly is allowed to cool to room temperature.

    <p num="70">
      Next, the delivery system subassembly comprising the substantially impermeable wall surrounding the compartment is filled with 340 mg of formulation at 40 (degree)  C., wherein the formulation comprises 33 wt % (weight percent) porcine somatotropin, 4.57 wt % sodium phosphate monobasic, 28.1 wt % water, 33.3 wt % glycerol, and 0.67 wt % Tween-80.
      <br/>
      Then, the two subassemblies at their opened ends are joined by inserting partially the member comprising the osmotic tablets and the wax into the member comprising the formulation.
      <br/>
      Next, 4 drops of moisture-cured cyanoacrylic adhesive are dropped onto the remaining exposed surface, the members fully inserted and then twisted to effect a sealed delivery system.

      Next, a rate controlling wall, shaped as a tube with an opened end and a closed end, is prepared from a wall forming composition comprising 28 g of cellulose acetate butyrate, 10 g of tributyl citrate and 12 g of polymethyl methacrylate.
      <br/>
      The rate controlling wall is prepared by slowly adding 12 g polymethyl methacrylate to a heated mixer, 170 (degree)  C., and mixed for about 5 minutes to allow the polymer crystals to fuse together.
      <br/>
      Next, several drops of the tributyl citrate plasticizer are added to the mixer.
      <br/>
      Then, about 5 g of the tributyl citrate is added to 28 g of cellulose acetate butyrate and the two ingredients mixed thoroughly into a homogeneous mixture.
      <br/>
      Next, the remainder of the tributyl citrate is added slowly to the polymethyl methacrylate, tributyl citrate in the mixer and the temperature of the mixer is lowered to 135 (degree)  C. Next, the cellulose acetate butyrate, tributyl citrate blend is added to the mixer and the temperature raised to 190 (degree)  C., to uniformly melt the cellulose acetate butyrate.
