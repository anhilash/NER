      <br/>
      A spindle motor including a double row bearing apparatus 2 for supporting a rotor hub 9 rotatably on a base 1.
      <br/>
      A labyrinth seal mechanism is incorporated into the bearing apparatus.
      <br/>
      The double row bearing apparatus includes a two-stepped shaft 3 and a pair of rows of rotating bodies 5a and 5b interposed between the shaft and a sleeve outer race 4 surrounding the shaft.
      <br/>
      A pair of inner and outer sealing plates 13a and 13b are provided between the spacing defined between the sleeve outer race and the inner race fitted around the reduced diameter portion of the shaft to form a labyrinth seal.
      <br/>
      A pair of inner and outer sealing plates 14a and 14b are also provided between the sleeve outer race and the inner race fitted around the enlarged diameter shaft portion to form a labyrinth seal.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is no necessity for the manufacturer of the motor to incorporate the additional sealing mechanism into the motor.
      <br/>
      Rather, the only necessity is to assemble the motor by employing the bearing apparatus to which the labyrinth seal mechanism or mechanisms are already incorporated by the maker of the bearing.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Technical Field
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates in particular to a spindle motor to be used in the hard disk drive means, and a hard disk drive apparatus including such a motor.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">The motor of the hard disk drive means employs grease or oil as a lubricant to be applied to the bearing.</p>
    <p num="5">
      In such kind of motors, splashing and dispersing of the lubricant from the bearing apparatus into the surrounding environment may be caused by the rotation of the motor.
      <br/>
      Further, fine dusts suspended in atmosphere is tend to get into the bearing assembly.
      <br/>
      In order to cope with such problems, some bearings has an annular sealing plate.
      <br/>
      The sealing structure of the prior art employing such annular sealing plate can be categorized into the contact type and the non-contact type.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In the case of the sealing structure of the non-contact type incorporated into the bearing apparatus, for example, the outer peripheral portion of the annular sealing plate is secured by means of adhesive to the end surface of the outer race with leaving a slight clearance between the inner peripheral portion thereof and the inner race to avoid the contact between them.</p>
    <p num="7">
      However, there is an problem of flowing the lubricant contained within the bearing out through the clearance while the motor is rotated in high speed.
      <br/>
      In the case of the motor for hard disk drive means, the lubricant flowing out through the clearance will be splashed through the clearance to make oil mist.
      <br/>
      Thus produced finely dispersed oil mist is apt to get into the disk enclosure of the hard disk drive means.
      <br/>
      These oil mist adhered on the magnetic disk or the magnetic head will cause the accidents such as the crushing of the magnetic disk and the magnetic head to reduce the reliability of the hard disk drive apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In order to prevent such accidents as mentioned above, a number of countermeasures have been taken by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, in one of the countermeasures, the annular sealing plate is secured to the outer race around the outer peripheral portion thereof and making the inner peripheral edge thereof contact with the inner race.
      <br/>
      In such a countermeasure, not only the heat or the torque are produced by the friction between the sealing plate and the inner race, but also the wear due to friction will cause the leakage of the lubricant or produce frictional particles, so that this countermeasure can not be adopted.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Under the reason as mentioned above, the motor including the sealing structure of the non-contacting type as well as an additional labyrinth seal mechanism, or the motor having a magnetic fluid sealing mechanism within the bearing apparatus are available today.
      <br/>
      However, the additional labyrinth seal mechanism will increase the production cost for manufacturing the motor.
      <br/>
      When the magnetic fluid is employed to seal, the magnetic fluid is tend to shift radially outwardly under the effect of centrifugal force.
      <br/>
      Further, the magnetic fluid sometimes splashes under the effect of locally effected differential of air pressure.
      <br/>
      In conclusion neither of these structure is appropriate to the motor for hard disk drive apparatus.
      <br/>
      In particular, the additional labyrinth seal mechanism is to be employed, the manufacturer of the motor is required to incorporate such labyrinth seal mechanism into the motor, so that the production cost of the motor is increased.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a motor suitable for the hard disk drive apparatus including a labyrinth seal mechanism incorporated into the bearing means to increase the sealing function of the sealing structure of non-contact type to provide a sufficient and reliable sealing function and a hard disk drive apparatus of increased reliability.
      <br/>
      It is only necessary for the manufacturer of the motor to assemble the motor with the bearing means into which a labyrinth seal mechanism had already been incorporated by the manufacturer of the bearing so that the production cost of the motor can be reduced.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="28">The First Embodiment of the Invention</p>
    <p num="29">
      The first embodiment of the motor of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 1a, 1b and 1c.
      <br/>
      The motor of this embodiment is of a fixed shaft type that the shaft 3 of the double row bearing apparatus 2 is secured to the base 1 having a flange 1a.
      <br/>
      The shaft 3 is a stepped shaft including enlarged and reduced diameter shaft portions 3a and 3b on the lower and upper end thereof respectively.
      <br/>
      A sleeve outer race 4 is supported by the shaft through a pair of upper and lower rows of balls 5a and 5b interposed as rotating bodies between the shaft and the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The sleeve outer race 4 is provided on its inner peripheral surface a pair of upper and lower rolling contact grooves 4a and 4b.
      <br/>
      The upper balls 5a i.e. rotating bodies of the first row is adapted to be interposed between a rolling contact groove 6a formed on an inner race 6 fitted on the reduced diameter shaft portion 3b and the upper rolling contact groove 4a i.e. the first rolling contact groove of the sleeve outer race.

      <br/>
      Balls 5a and 5b are adapted to be retained by means of ball retainers 8.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The outer diameter of the enlarged shaft portion 3a and that of the inner race 6 fitted around the reduced diameter shaft portion 3b are identical with each other, so that the balls of the same diameter can be employed as upper and lower balls 5a, 5b.</p>
    <p num="32">
      A rotor hub 9 has a vertically extending bore 10 within which the sleeve outer race 4 is fitted so as to rotatably support the rotor hub 9.

      <br/>
      The outer peripheral portion of the inner sealing plate 13a is secured with adhesive on the end surface of the inner shoulder 15a with remaining a slight clearance (a) between the inner peripheral surface thereof and the outer peripheral surface of the inner shoulder 16a to avoid the contact between them to provide the labyrinth seal function.
    </p>
    <p num="36">The inner peripheral portion of the outer sealing plate 13b is secured with adhesive on the outer peripheral surface of the outer shoulder 16b of the inner race 6 with remaining a slight clearance (b) between the outer peripheral surface thereof and the outer shoulder 15b of the sleeve outer race to avoid the contact between them to provide the labyrinth seal function.</p>
    <p num="37">

      The second embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 2a, 2b and 2c.
      <br/>
      The second embodiment is substantially the same in its rotational mechanism as that of the first embodiment.
      <br/>

    <p num="108">The sealing plates of the non-contact type utilized in the present invention will not produce the frictional torque so that the loss of power of the motor due to friction can be inhibited, the energy required for driving the motor can be reduced, and the energy-saving can be achieved.</p>
    <p num="109">Further, the sealing plates of the non-contact type will not produce the heat or particles due to the friction, will not affect the reliability of the equipment to which the motor of the present invention is incorporated, and will not produce the vibration or noise due to friction so that stillness during the operation of the motor can be assured.</p>
    <p num="110">
      The manufacturing of the sealing plate can be effected easily, precisely, and low cost because of its annular disk shaped member.
      <br/>
      In this connection, the cost for machining and assembling the sealing plates can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      The labyrinth seal structure incorporated into the double row bearing apparatus will prohibit the necessity of providing the additional labyrinth seal mechanism as effected in the motor of the prior art.
      <br/>
      In this connection, the cost for machining and the mould can be reduced or eliminated so that the motor of the present invention can be manufactured in low cost.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      In accordance with the present invention, the flowing of the lubricant out from the bearing apparatus of the motor can be inhibited, so that there are almost no possibility of the crushing of the magnetic head due to the lubricant, and the production of the frictional heat, frictional particles, and vibration and noise can also be prohibited.
